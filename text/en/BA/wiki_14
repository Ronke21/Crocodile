<text>Pietro Antonio Domenico Trapassi (3 January 1698 – 12 April 1782), better known by his pseudonym of Pietro Metastasio (), was an Italian poet and librettist, considered the most important writer of &quot;opera seria&quot; libretti.

== Early life ==

Metastasio was born in Rome, where his father, Felice Trapassi, a native of Assisi, had taken service in the Corsican regiment of the papal forces. Felice married a Bolognese woman, Francesca Galasti, and became a grocer in the &quot;Via dei Cappellari&quot;. The couple had two sons and two daughters; Pietro was the younger son.

Pietro, while still a child, is said to have attracted crowds by reciting impromptu verses on a given subject. On one such occasion in 1709, two men of distinction stopped to listen: Giovanni Vincenzo Gravina, famous for legal and literary erudition as well as his directorship of the Arcadian Academy, and Lorenzini, a critic of some note. Gravina was attracted by the boy&#x27;s poetic talent and personal charm, and made Pietro his &quot;protégé&quot;; in the course of a few weeks he adopted him. Felice Trapassi was glad to give his son the chance of a good education and introduction into society.

Gravina hellenized the boy&#x27;s name Trapassi into Metastasio, and intended his adopted son to be a jurist like himself. He therefore made the boy learn Latin and law. At the same time he cultivated his literary gifts, and displayed the youthful prodigy both at his own house and in the Roman coteries. Metastasio soon found himself competing with the most celebrated &quot;improvvisatori&quot; of his time in Italy. However, his days full of study and evenings devoted to improvising poetry took a toll on Pietro&#x27;s health.

Gravina, making a business trip to Calabria, exhibited Metastasio in the literary circles of Naples, then placed him in the care of his kinsman Gregorio Caroprese at Scaléa. In country air and the quiet of the southern seashore Metastasio&#x27;s health revived. Gravina decided that he should never improvise again, but should be reserved for nobler efforts, when, having completed his education, he might enter into competition with the greatest poets.

Metastasio responded to his patron&#x27;s wishes. At the age of twelve he translated the &quot;Iliad&quot; into octave stanzas; and two years later he composed a Senecan tragedy on a subject from Gian Giorgio Trissino&#x27;s &quot;Italia liberata&quot; – Gravina&#x27;s favourite epic. It was called &quot;Giustino&quot;, and was printed in 1713; forty-two years later, Metastasio told his publisher that he would willingly suppress this juvenilia.

Caroprese died in 1714, leaving Gravina his heir; and in 1718 Gravina also died. Metastasio inherited a fortune of 15,000 scudi. At a meeting of the Arcadian Academy, he recited an elegy to his patron, and then settled down to enjoy his wealth.

== Roman fame ==

Metastasio was now twenty. During the last four years he had worn the costume of abbé, having taken the minor orders without which it was then useless to expect advancement in Rome. His romantic history, personal beauty, charming manners and distinguished talents made him fashionable. Within two years he had spent his money and increased his reputation. He decided to apply himself seriously to the work of his profession. He migrated to Naples, and entered the office of an eminent lawyer named Castagnola, who exercised severe control over his time and energies.

While slaving at the law, Metastasio in 1721 composed an epithalamium, and probably also his first musical serenade, &quot;Endimione&quot; (Endymion), on the occasion of the marriage of his patroness Donna Anna Francesca Ravaschieri Pinelli di Sangro (later 6th Principessa di Belmonte) to the Marchese Don Antonio Pignatelli (later His Serene Highness Prince of Belmonte). In 1722, while Naples was under Austrian rule, the birthday of Empress Elisabeth Christine had to be celebrated with more than ordinary honours, and the viceroy asked Metastasio to compose a serenata for the occasion. Metastasio accepted, but kept his authorship secret. He wrote &quot;Gli orti esperidi&quot;, which was set to music by Nicola Porpora, and sung by Porpora&#x27;s pupil, the castrato Farinelli, making a spectacular début, it won the most enthusiastic applause. The Roman prima donna, Marianna Bulgarelli, who played Venus in this opera, spared no pains until she had discovered its author.

Bulgarelli persuaded the poet to give up the law, and promised to secure for him fame and independence if he would devote his talents to the musical drama. In her house Metastasio became acquainted with the greatest composers of the day: Johann Adolph Hasse, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Alessandro Scarlatti, Leonardo Vinci, Leonardo Leo, Francesco Durante, and Benedetto Marcello, all of whom would later set his plays to melody. Here too he studied the art of singing, and learned to appreciate the style of such men as Farinelli. Metastasio wrote quickly and his plays were enhanced by being set to music and sung by the greatest singers of the day..
Metastasio lived with Bulgarelli and her husband in Rome. Moved by an affection half maternal, half romantic, and by admiration for his talent, she adopted him more passionately even than Gravina had done. She took the whole Trapassi family – father, mother, brother, sisters – into her own house. She fostered the poet&#x27;s genius and pampered his caprices. Under her influence he wrote in rapid succession &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot;, &quot;Catone in Utica&quot;, &quot;Ezio&quot;, &quot;Alessandro nell&#x27; Indie&quot;, &quot;Semiramide riconosciuta&quot;, &quot;Siroe&quot; and &quot;Artaserse&quot;. These dramas were set to music by the chief composers of the day, and performed in the chief towns of Italy.

But meanwhile Bulgarelli was growing older; she had ceased to sing in public; and the poet increasingly felt his dependence upon her kindness irksome. He gained 300 scudi for each opera; this pay, though good, was precarious and he longed for some fixed engagement. In September 1729 he received the offer of the post of court poet to the theatre at Vienna, succeeding Pietro Pariati, with a stipend of 3,000 florins. This he at once accepted. Bulgarelli unselfishly sped him on his way to glory. She took charge of his family in Rome and he set off for Austria.

== Vienna ==

In the early summer of 1730, Metastasio settled at Vienna in an apartment in the so-called &#x27;Michaelerhaus&#x27;. This date marks a new period in his artistic activity. Between the years 1730 and 1740 his finest dramas, &quot;Adriano in Siria&quot;, &quot;Demetrio&quot;, &quot;Issipile&quot;, &quot;Demofoonte&quot;, &quot;Olimpiade&quot;, &quot;Clemenza di Tito&quot;, &quot;Achille in Sciro&quot;, &quot;Temistocle&quot; and &quot;Attilio Regolo&quot;, were produced for the imperial theatre. Some of them had to be composed for special occasions, with almost incredible rapidity: &quot;Achille&quot; in eighteen days, &quot;Ipermestra&quot; in nine. Poet, composer, musical copyist and singer did their work together in frantic haste. Metastasio understood the technique of his peculiar art in its minutest details. The experience gained at Naples and Rome, quickened by the excitement of his new career at Vienna, enabled him almost instinctively, and as it were by inspiration, to hit the exact mark aimed at in the opera.

The libretto &quot;Adriano in Siria&quot; was used by more than 60 other composers in the 18th and early 19th century: Antonio Caldara (1732), Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1734), Francesco Maria Veracini (1735), Baldassare Galuppi (1740), Carl Heinrich Graun (1746), Johann Adolph Hasse (1752), Johann Christian Bach (1765), Luigi Cherubini (1782) and in &quot;Adriano in Siria&quot; (Mysliveček) from 1776.

In Vienna Metastasio met with no marked social success. His plebeian birth excluded him from aristocratic circles. To make up in some measure for this comparative failure, he enjoyed the intimacy of the , sister-in-law of his old patroness the Princess Belmonte Pignatelli. She had lost her husband, and had some while occupied the post of chief favourite to the emperor. Metastasio&#x27;s liaison with her became so close that it was believed they had been privately married.

Bulgarelli tired of his absence, and asked Metastasio to get her an engagement at the court theatre. He was ashamed of her and tired of her, and wrote dissuading her from the projected visit. The tone of his letters alarmed and irritated her. She seems to have set out from Rome, but died suddenly upon the road. All we know is that she left him her fortune after her husband&#x27;s life interest in it had expired, and that Metastasio, overwhelmed with grief and remorse, immediately renounced the legacy. This disinterested act plunged the Bulgarelli-Metastasio household at Rome into confusion. Bulgarelli&#x27;s widower married again. Metastasio&#x27;s brother, Leopoldo Trapassi, and his father and sister, were thrown upon their own resources.

As time advanced, the life which Metastasio led at Vienna, together with the climate, told on his health and spirits. From about the year 1745 onward he wrote little, though the cantatas which belong to this period, and the canzonetta &quot;Ecco quel fiero istante&quot;, which he sent to his friend Farinelli, rank among the most popular of his productions. It was clear, as Vernon Lee has phrased it, that &quot;what ailed him was mental and moral &quot;. In 1755 the Countess Althann died, and Metastasio&#x27;s social contacts were reduced to the gatherings round him in the bourgeois house of his friend Nicolo Martines, the secretary to the papal Nuncio in Vienna. He sank rapidly into the habits of old age; and, though he lived till the year 1782, he was very inactive. He died on 12 April, bequeathing his whole fortune of some 130,000 florins to the six children of Nicolo Martines. He had survived all his Italian relatives.

Throughout the forty years of his career in Vienna, in the course of which Metastasio eventually outlived his own originality and creative powers, his fame went on increasing. In his library he counted as many as forty editions of his own works. They had been translated into French, English, German, Spanish, and modern Greek. They had been set to music over and over again by every composer of distinction. They had been sung by the best virtuosi in every capital, and there was not a literary academy of note which had not conferred on him the honour of membership. Strangers of distinction passing through Vienna made a point of paying their respects to the old poet at his lodgings at Kohlmarkt.

But his poetry was intended for a certain style of music – for the music of omnipotent vocalists, of exceedingly skilled sopranos and castrati. When the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart—focusing more on psychology and less on virtuoso singing—came into vogue, a new style of libretto was needed (Mozart did use an old Metastasio libretto for his renowned opera &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, but, it was substantially re-written for the purpose). The demise of castrato singing meant that Metastasio&#x27;s operas dropped out of the repertory.

Metastasio&#x27;s poetry is emotional, lyrical, and romantic. His chief dramatic situations are expressed by lyrics for two or three voices, embodying the several contending passions of the agents brought into conflict by the circumstances of the plot. The total result is not pure literature, but literature fit for musical effect. Language in Metastasio&#x27;s hands is musical, lucid, and songlike, perhaps due to his experience as an improvisatory poet. He was an admirer of Torquato Tasso, Giambattista Marino, Giovanni Battista Guarini, and Ovid.

Composers continued to set Metastasio’s poetry to music even after his death. German composer Georgina Schubert (1840–1878) used his text for her lieder &quot;Gondoliera&quot;.

<doc id="214010" wikidata="Q29577" url="?curid=214010" title="Leonardo Vinci">
<text>Leonardo Vinci (1690 – 27 May 1730) was an Italian Baroque composer known chiefly for his 40 or so operas; comparatively little of his work in other genres survives. A central proponent of the Neapolitan School of opera, his influence on subsequent opera composers such as Johann Adolph Hasse and Giovanni Battista Pergolesi was considerable.

==Life and career==

He was born at Strongoli and educated at Naples under Gaetano Greco in the Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesù Cristo. He first became known for his &quot;opere buffe&quot; (comic operas) in the Neapolitan language in 1719; he also composed many &quot;opere serie&quot; (dramatic operas). He was received into the Congregation of the Rosary, a lay religious and burial fraternity, at Formiello in 1728. He died in May 1730. Vinci is rumoured to have been poisoned by a jealous husband in the wake of an ill-advised affair, a story which is given by several reliable authorities without evident contradictions.

==Music==
Vinci&#x27;s &quot;opere buffe,&quot; of which &quot;Li zite &#x27;ngalera&quot; (1722) is generally regarded as the best, are full of life and spirit; his &quot;opere serie,&quot; of which &quot;Didone Abbandonata&quot; (Rome, 1726) and &quot;Artaserse&quot; (Rome, 1730) are the most notable, have an incisive vigour and directness of dramatic expression praised by music historian Charles Burney. According to Burney, 
The well-known aria &quot;Vo solcando,&quot; from &quot;Artaserse&quot;, is a good example of his style.

His sonata in D major for flute and basso continuo is still played today. He composed two sonatas for the recorder in addition to a recorder concerto in A minor.

<doc id="214011" wikidata="Q130290" url="?curid=214011" title="Hyōgo Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. Hyōgo Prefecture has a population of 5,469,762 () and a geographic area of . Hyōgo Prefecture borders Kyoto Prefecture to the east, Osaka Prefecture to the southeast, and Okayama and Tottori prefectures to the west.

Kobe is the capital and largest city of Hyōgo Prefecture, and the seventh-largest city in Japan, with other major cities including Himeji, Nishinomiya, and Amagasaki. Hyōgo Prefecture&#x27;s mainland stretches from the Sea of Japan to the Seto Inland Sea, where Awaji Island and a small archipelago of islands belonging to the prefecture are located. Hyōgo Prefecture is a major economic center, transportation hub, and tourist destination in western Japan, with 20% of the prefecture&#x27;s land area designated as Natural Parks. Hyōgo Prefecture forms part of the Kobe metropolitan area and Osaka metropolitan area, the second-most-populated urban region in Japan after the Greater Tokyo area and one of the world&#x27;s most productive regions by GDP.

== History ==

Present-day Hyōgo Prefecture includes the former provinces of Harima, Tajima, Awaji, and parts of Tanba and Settsu.

In 1180, near the end of the Heian period, Emperor Antoku, Taira no Kiyomori, and the Imperial court moved briefly to Fukuhara, in what is now the city of Kobe. There the capital remained for five months. Himeji Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is in the city of Himeji.

Southern Hyōgo Prefecture was severely devastated by the 6.9 Mw Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995, which destroyed major parts of Kobe and Awaji, as well as Nishinomiya and Ashiya and the neighboring Osaka Prefecture, killing nearly 6,500 people.

== Geography ==


Hyōgo has coastlines on two seas: to the north, the Sea of Japan, to the south, the Seto Inland Sea. On Awaji Island, Hyōgo borders the Pacific Ocean coastline in the Kii Channel. The northern portion is sparsely populated, except for the city of Toyooka, The central highlands are only populated by tiny villages. Most of Hyōgo&#x27;s population lives on the southern coast, which is part of the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto metropolitan area. Awaji is an island that separates the Inland Sea and Osaka Bay, lying between Honshu and Shikoku.

Summertime weather throughout Hyōgo is hot and humid. As for winter conditions, the north of Hyōgo tends to receive abundant snow, whilst the south receives only the occasional flurry.

Hyōgo borders on Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture, Tottori Prefecture and Okayama Prefecture.

 20% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Sanin Kaigan and Setonaikai National Parks; Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan Quasi-National Park; and Asago Gunzan, Harima Chūbu Kyūryō, Inagawa Keikoku, Izushi-Itoi, Kasagatayama-Sengamine, Kiyomizu-Tōjōko-Tachikui, Onzui-Chikusa, Seiban Kyūryō, Seppiko-Mineyama, Tajima Sangaku, and Taki Renzan Prefectural Natural Parks.

==Sister regions==

Hyogo entered a sister state relationship with Washington state in the United States on October 22, 1963, the first such arrangement between Japan and the United States.

In 1981, a sister state agreement was drawn up between Hyogo and the state of Western Australia in Australia. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of this agreement in 1992, the Hyogo Prefectural Government Cultural Centre was established in Perth.

<text>Charles Burney (7 April 1726 – 12 April 1814) was an English music historian, composer and musician. He was the father of the writers Frances Burney and Sarah Burney, of the explorer James Burney, and of Charles Burney, a classicist and book donor to the British Museum. He was a close friend and supporter of Joseph Haydn and other composers.

==Early life and career==
Charles Burney was born at Raven Street, Shrewsbury, the fourth of six children of James Macburney (1678–1749), a musician, dancer and portrait painter, and his second wife Ann (&quot;née&quot; Cooper, –1775). In childhood he and a brother Richard (1723–1792) were for unknown reasons sent to the care of a &quot;Nurse Ball&quot; at nearby Condover, where they lived until 1739. He began formal education at Shrewsbury School in 1737 and was later sent in 1739 to The King&#x27;s School, Chester, where his father then lived and worked. His first music master was a Mr Baker, the cathedral organist, and a pupil of John Blow. Returning to Shrewsbury at the age of 15, Burney continued his musical studies for three years under his half-brother, James Burney, organist of St Mary&#x27;s Church, and was then sent to London as a pupil of Thomas Arne for three years.

Burney wrote some music for Arne&#x27;s &quot;Alfred&quot;, which was produced at Drury Lane Theatre on 30 March 1745. In 1749 he was appointed organist of St Dionis Backchurch, Fenchurch Street, with a salary of £30 a year. According to the voting book, he secured the post against six other candidates with votes 50 to 4. He was also engaged to take the harpsichord in the &quot;New Concerts&quot; then recently established at the King&#x27;s Arms, Cornhill. It was for his health that he went in 1751 to Lynn Regis in Norfolk, where he was elected organist, with an annual salary of £100. He lived there for nine years. During that time he began to entertain the idea of writing a general history of music. His &quot;Ode for St Cecilia&#x27;s Day&quot; was performed at Ranelagh Gardens in 1759. In 1760 he returned to London in good health and with a young family. His eldest child, Esther, a girl of eight, surprised the public with her achievements as a harpsichord player. The concertos for harpsichord which Burney published soon after his return to London were much admired. In 1766 he produced, at Drury Lane, a translation and adaptation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Devin du village&quot;, under the title of &quot;The Cunning Man&quot;.

==Family and social life==
In 1749, while working as an organist and harpsichordist in London, Charles married Esther Sleepe (c.1725–1762). The couple had six children: Esther or Hetty, who later became Mrs Burney on marrying her cousin Charles Rousseau Burney, the explorer James Burney, the celebrated writer Frances Burney (often called Fanny), the correspondent Susan (Susy), Charlotte (later Mrs Francis), and Charles Burney, a classicist and school headmaster.

As vividly recorded by Fanny, the family moved in a lively cultural circle in London, which included the portrait painter Sir Joshua Reynolds, the lexicographer Samuel Johnson, the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the composers Harriet Wainwright and Joseph Haydn, the essayist Edmund Burke and the MP for Southwark Henry Thrale, whose wife Hester Thrale was a close friend of Fanny&#x27;s.

Charles&#x27;s first wife Esther died in 1761. In 1767 he was married a second time, to Elizabeth Allen (Mrs Stephen Allen) of Lynn. From this union he had a son, Richard Thomas, and a daughter, Sarah Harriet Burney, who became a novelist.

==Later career==
The University of Oxford honoured Burney, on 23 June 1769, with the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Music, and his own work was performed. This consisted of an anthem, with an overture, solos, recitatives and choruses, accompanied by instruments, besides a vocal anthem in eight parts, which was not performed. In 1769 he published &quot;An essay towards a history of the principal comets that have appeared since 1742&quot;. Amidst his various professional avocations, Burney never lost sight of his main project, his &quot;History of Music&quot;. He decided to travel abroad and collect materials that could not be found in Britain. He left London in June 1770, carrying numerous letters of introduction, and travelled to Paris, Geneva, Turin, Milan, Padua, Venice, Bologna (where he met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his father), Florence, Rome and Naples. The results of his observations were published in a well-received book, &quot;The Present State of Music in France and Italy&quot; (1771). In July 1772 Burney again visited the continent to do further research, and on his return to London published an account of his tour under the title &quot;The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces&quot; (1773). In 1773 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1776 appeared the first volume (in quarto) of Burney&#x27;s long-projected &quot;History of Music&quot;. In 1782 Burney published his second volume; and in 1789 the third and fourth. The &quot;History of Music&quot; was generally well received, although criticized by Forkel in Germany and by the Spanish ex-Jesuit, Requeno, who in his &quot;Saggj sul Ristabilimento dell&#x27; Arte Armonica de&#x27; Greci e Romani Canton&quot; (Parma, 1798) attacked Burney&#x27;s account of ancient Greek music and called him &quot;lo scompigliato Burney&quot; (the confused Burney). The fourth volume covers the birth and development of opera and the musical scene in England in Burney&#x27;s time. Burney&#x27;s first tour was translated into German by Christoph Daniel Ebeling, and printed at Hamburg in 1772. His second tour, translated into German by Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, was published at Hamburg in 1773. A Dutch translation of his second tour, with notes by J. W. Lustig, organist at Groningen, was published there in 1786. The &quot;Dissertation on the Music of the Ancients&quot;, in the first volume of Burney&#x27;s History, was translated into German by Johann Joachim Eschenburg, and printed at Leipzig, 1781. Burney derived much aid from the first two volumes of Padre Martini&#x27;s very learned &quot;Storia della Musica&quot; (Bologna, 1757–1770).

In 1774 he had written &quot;A Plan for a Music School&quot;. In 1779 he wrote for the Royal Society an account of the young William Crotch, whose remarkable musical talent excited so much attention at that time. In 1784 he published, with an Italian title page, the music annually performed in the Pope&#x27;s chapel at Rome during Passion Week. In 1785 he published, for the benefit of the Musical Fund, an account of the first commemoration of George Friedrich Handel in Westminster Abbey in the preceding year, with a life of Handel. In 1796 he published &quot;Memoirs and Letters of Metastasio&quot;.
Towards the close of his life Burney was paid £1000 for contributing to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; all the musical articles not belonging to the department of natural philosophy and mathematics. The latter were written by John Farey, Sr and Jr. Burney&#x27;s contribution to Rees included much new material which had not appeared in his earlier writings, particularly about the London music scene then. In 1783, through the treasury influence of his friend Edmund Burke, he was appointed organist to the chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea. He moved there from St Martin&#x27;s Street, Leicester Square and remained there for the rest of his life. He penned and published a sonnet in honour of Joseph Haydn, whom he had been in correspondence with throughout Haydn&#x27;s two trips to London. His admiration for Handel greatly influenced Haydn&#x27;s decision to focus on oratorio upon his return to Vienna, which would eventually result in the composition of The Creation. In 1810, he was made a member of the Institute of France and nominated a correspondent in the class of the fine arts. From 1806 until his death he enjoyed a pension of £300 granted by Charles James Fox. He died at Chelsea College on 12 April 1814, and was interred in the burial ground of the college. A tablet was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.

Burney&#x27;s library was sold at auction by John White of Westminster beginning on 8 August 1814.

==Likenesses and accounts==
Burney&#x27;s portrait was painted by Reynolds in 1781 for Henry Thrale&#x27;s library. His bust was cut by Nollekens in 1805. He also appears in James Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Thames&quot; (also known as &quot;Triumph of Navigation&quot;), which was painted in 1791 for the Royal Society of Arts. He had a wide circle of acquaintance among the distinguished artists and literary men of his day. At one time he thought of writing a life of his friend Samuel Johnson, but retired before the crowd of biographers who rushed into that field.

Burney&#x27;s eldest son, James Burney, was a distinguished officer in the Royal Navy, who died a rear-admiral in 1821, having accompanied Captain Cook on his last two voyages. His second son was the Rev. Charles Burney, a major donor of books to the British Museum, and his second daughter was Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D&#x27;Arblay. Her published diary and letters contain many minute and interesting particulars of her father&#x27;s public and private life, and of his friends and contemporaries, including his initial opposition to her marriage to the French refugee Alexandre D&#x27;Arblay in 1793 and to her sister Charlotte&#x27;s remarriage to the pamphleteer and stock jobber Ralph Broome in 1798. A life of Burney was compiled by Madame D&#x27;Arblay and appeared in 1832, but it has been criticized consistently for being eulogistic. His daughter by his second marriage, Sarah Burney, was likewise a novelist. Her letters provide interesting, less adulatory information about her father. Although Sarah looked after him in his old age, their personal relations remained poor.

==Cultural references==
Samuel Johnson drew inspiration from &quot;The Present State of Music in France and Italy&quot; (1771), according to later writers: &quot;Dr. Burney published an account of his tour ... which was extremely well received, and deemed by the best judges so good a model for travellers who were inclined to give a description of what they had seen or observed, that Dr. Johnson professedly imitated it in his own Tour of the Hebrides, saying, &#x27;I had that clever dog Burney&#x27;s &quot;Musical Tour&quot; in my eye.

Burney appears in a story by Lillian de la Torre (Lillian Bueno McCue, 1902–1993), a US writer of historical mysteries, entitled &quot;The Viotti Stradivarius&quot;, part of her series featuring Samuel Johnson as a &quot;detector&quot; (detective). The story features a fictitious meeting between Burney, his daughter Fanny, Giovanni Battista Viotti and his Stradivarius, and Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov, along with Johnson and James Boswell, in connection with the theft and recovery of the Orlov diamond.

==Burney&#x27;s papers==
After his death in 1814, Burney&#x27;s daughter Frances destroyed many manuscripts, including his journals, and obliterated passages in others. Burney&#x27;s library was sold at auction in London by Leigh &amp; Sotheby on 9 June 1814 (and eight following days); a copy of the sale catalogue is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.163(7)). Surviving papers are widely scattered: in the Osborn Collection at Yale University, the Berg Collection at New York Public Library, the British Library and the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and in smaller public and private collections. (See Roger Lonsdale, &quot;Dr Charles Burney, a Literary Biography&quot;, Oxford 1965 pp 495–497.) The Burney Centre at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, has long been publishing the papers of the Burney family, including those of Charles and his daughter, Francis (Fanny Burney).

<text>Johann Nikolaus Forkel (22 February 1749 – 20 March 1818) was a German musicologist and music theorist, generally regarded as among the founders of modern musicology. His publications include the two-volume &quot;Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik&quot; (&quot;General History of Music&quot;), among the first attempts at a history of Western music and the &quot;ground-breaking music bibliography&quot; &quot;Allgemeine Litteratur der Musik&quot;. He also authored &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work&quot;, the first substantial survey on the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach.

==Biography==
He was born at Meeder in Coburg in the Holy Roman Empire on 22 February 1749. He was the son of a cobbler, and received early musical training, especially in keyboard playing, from Johann Heinrich Schulthesius, who was the local Kantor. In other aspects of his music education he was self-taught, especially in regards to theory. As a teenager he served as a singer in Lüneburg, and studied law for two years at the University of Göttingen; he remained associated with the university for more than fifty years, where he held varied positions, including instructor of music theory, organist, keyboard teacher, and eventually director of all music at the university. In 1787 he received an honorary doctorate of philosophy from the institution.

Forkel is often regarded as the founder of Historical Musicology, for it is with him that the study of music history and theory became an academic discipline with rigorous standards of scholarship.

He was an enthusiastic admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music he did much to popularize. He also wrote the first biography of Bach (in 1802), one which is of particular value today, as he was still able to correspond directly with Bach&#x27;s sons Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, and thereby obtained much valuable information that would otherwise have been lost.

His library, which was accumulated with care and discrimination at a time when rare books were cheap, forms a valuable portion of the Berlin State Library and also of the library of the Königliche Institut für Kirchenmusik.

He died at Göttingen.

==Selected works==
Forkel&#x27;s writings include:
*&quot;Über die Theorie der Musik&quot; (Göttingen, 1777)
*&quot;Musikalisch kritische Bibliothek&quot; (Gotha, 1778)
*&quot;Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik&quot; (Leipzig, 1788, 1801)
*&quot;Allgemeine Litteratur der Musik: oder, Anleitung zur Kenntniss musikalischer Bücher, welche von den ältesten bis auf die neusten Zeiten bey den Griechen, Römern und den meisten neuern europäischen Nationen sind geschrieben worden; systematisch geordnet, und nach Veranlassung mit Anmerkungen und Urtheilen begleitet&quot; (Leipzig 1792), known in English as &quot;Dictionary of Musical Literature&quot;
*&quot;Ueber Johann Sebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke. Für patriotische Verehrer echter musikalischer Kunst&quot; (Leipzig, 1802)

To his musical compositions, which are numerous, little interest is to be attached today. However, he wrote variations on &quot;God Save the King&quot; for the clavichord, and that Georg Joseph Vogler wrote a sharp criticism on them, which appeared at Frankfurt in 1793 together with a set of variations as he conceived they ought to be written.

<text>Ollie &quot;Dink&quot; Johnson (1892 – November 29, 1954) was an American Dixieland jazz pianist, clarinetist, and drummer.

==Background==
Johnson was born in 1892, most likely in New Orleans, although the date is disputed and some sources have cited the place of birth as Biloxi, Mississippi. His mother, Hattie, was unmarried and his father&#x27;s name is unknown. His elder half-brother was double bassist William Manuel &quot;Bill&quot; Johnson. He worked around Mississippi and New Orleans before moving to the western United States in the early 1910s. He played around Nevada and California, often with his brother Bill. He played with the Original Creole Orchestra, mostly on drums.

Johnson made his first recordings in 1922 on clarinet with Kid Ory&#x27;s Band. He made more recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly on piano, although also doing some one-man band recordings, playing all three of his instruments through over dubbing. Johnson&#x27;s piano style was influenced by Jelly Roll Morton (the common-law husband of Johnson&#x27;s half-sister, Bessie, known as Anita Gonzales). Dink&#x27;s clarinet playing was influenced by Larry Shields. Johnson wrote tunes, including &quot;The Krooked Blues&quot; (recorded by King Oliver) and &quot;So Different Blues&quot;.

Johnson died in Portland, Oregon in 1954, aged 62.

<doc id="214023" wikidata="Q296265" url="?curid=214023" title="Filippino Lippi">
<text>Filippino Lippi (probably 1457 – 18 April 1504) was an Italian Renaissance painter mostly working in Florence, Italy during the later years of the Early Renaissance and first few years of the High Renaissance. He also worked in Rome for a period from 1488, and later in the Milan area and Bologna.

He worked in oils, tempera and fresco, mostly painting religious subjects, with a few portraits and secular allegories or scenes from classical mythology.

== Biography ==
Filippino Lippi was born, probably in 1457, at Prato, Tuscany, the illegitimate son to Lucrezia Buti and the painter Fra Filippo Lippi; both had broken clerical vows, and though after Filippino&#x27;s birth they received a papal dispensation to marry (arranged by Lorenzo di Medici), Vasari says that they never did. His sister Alessandra was born in 1465. Filippino first trained under his father in his workshop.

They moved to Spoleto, where Filippino served as workshop assistant during the construction of Spoleto Cathedral. When his father died in 1469, Filippino was aged twelve and among the assistants to his father who completed the frescoes with &quot;Storie della Vergine&quot; (&quot;Life of the Virgin&quot;) in the cathedral. 

He later completed his apprenticeship in the workshop of Botticelli, who also had been a pupil of Filippino&#x27;s father. In the 1472 records of the Painters&#x27; guild it is noted that Botticelli had only Filippino Lippi as an assistant, who was living in his master&#x27;s house. The two artists often worked together on the same project. The shared works include the panels from a dismantled pair of &quot;cassoni&quot;, now divided among the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, the Musée Condé in Chantilly, and the Galleria Pallavicini in Rome. Works by Botticelli and Filippino from these years include many paintings of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; which are often difficult to distinguish from one another.
His early solo works greatly resemble those of Botticelli, but perhaps with less sensitivity and subtlety. The first ones (dating from 1475 onward) were attributed to an anonymous &quot;Amico di Sandro&quot; (&quot;Friend of Botticelli&quot;), a term introduced by Bernard Berenson in 1899, though by 30 years later his &quot;lists&quot; gave most of them to Lippi. Eventually Lippi&#x27;s style evolved becoming more personal and effective during the period 1480–1485. Works of this early period include: the &quot;Madonnas&quot; of Berlin, London, and Washington, D.C., the &quot;Journeys of Tobia&quot; of the Galleria Sabauda, Turin, the &quot;Madonna of the Sea&quot; of Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia, Florence, and the &quot;Histories of Ester&quot;.

Together with Perugino (another pupil of his father), Ghirlandaio, and Botticelli, Lippi worked on the decoration of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s villa at Spedaletto. On 31 December 1482, he was commissioned to decorate a wall of the Sala dell&#x27;Udienza of Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, a work never begun. 

Soon after, probably in 1483–84, he was called to complete Masaccio&#x27;s decoration of the Brancacci Chapel in the Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze, that had been left unfinished when the artist died in 1428. There Filippino painted &quot;Stories of Saint Peter&quot;, in the following frescoes: &quot;Quarrel with Simon Magus in face of Nero&quot;, &quot;Resurrection of the Son of Teophilus&quot;, &quot;Saint Peter Jailed&quot;, &quot;Liberation&quot;, and &quot;Crucifixion of Saint Peter&quot;. His self-portrait at age twenty-five is at the right hand portion of the central panel, Disputation with Simon Magus and Crucifixion of St. Peter (&quot;see&quot; detail at info box). 

Lippi&#x27;s work on the Sala degli Otto di Pratica, in the Palazzo Vecchio, was completed on 20 February 1486. It is now in the Uffizi Gallery. At about this time, Piero di Francesco del Pugliese asked him to paint the altarpiece with the &quot;Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard&quot;, which is now in the Badia Fiorentina, Florence. This is Lippi&#x27;s most popular painting: a composition of unreal items, with its very particular elongated figures, backed by a phantasmagorical scenario of rocks and almost anthropomorphic trunks. The work is dated to 1485–1487.

Later, he worked for Tanai de&#x27; Nerli in Florence&#x27;s Santo Spirito church.

On 21 April 1487, Filippo Strozzi asked him to decorate the Strozzi family chapel in Santa Maria Novella with &quot;Stories of St. John Evangelist and St. Philip&quot;. He worked on this commission on and off over a long time. He only completed it in 1503, after Strozzi&#x27;s death. The windows with musical themes, in the same chapel, also designed by Filippino, were completed between June and July 1503. These paintings have been considered as influenced by the political and religious crisis in Florence at the time: the theme of the fresco, the clash between Christianity and Paganism, was hotly debated during those years and in connection with Girolamo Savonarola.

Filippino depicted his characters in a landscape that recreated the ancient world in its finest details, showing the influence of the Grottesco style he had seen during his time in Rome. He created an &quot;animated&quot;, mysterious, fantastic, but disquieting style, showing the unreality of nightmares. Thus, Filippino portrayed ruthless executioners with grim faces, who raged against the Saints. In the scene of &quot;St. Philip expelling a monster from the temple&quot;, the statue of the pagan deity is represented as a living figure challenging the Christian saint.

In 1488, Lippi went to Rome, where Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici had advised Cardinal Oliviero Carafa to entrust him with the decoration of the family chapel in Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The frescoes he produced there show a new inspiration, different from his earlier works, but confirm Lippi&#x27;s continued research on the themes of the classical era. He completed the series by 1493.

Lippi&#x27;s returned to Florence some time between 1491 and 1494. Works of this period include: &quot;Apparition of Christ to the Virgin&quot; (, now in Munich), &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; (1496, for the church of San Donato in Scopeto, now in the Uffizi), &quot;Sacrifice of Laocoön&quot; (end of the century, for the villa of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici at Poggio a Caiano), &quot;St. John Baptist and Maddalena&quot; (Valori Chapel in San Procolo, Florence, inspired by Luca Signorelli&#x27;s works).

He also worked away from his home town, at the Certosa di Pavia, or Charterhouse, outside Pavia and in Prato, where, in 1503, he completed the &quot;Tabernacle of the Christmas Song&quot;, now in the City Museum. In 1501 Lippi painted the &quot;Mystic Wedding of St. Catherine&quot; for the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna.

Lippi&#x27;s final work was the &quot;Deposition&quot; for the Santissima Annunziata church in Florence, which he left unifinished when he died in 1504.

He died on 18 April 1504, at age forty-seven. Because of Lippi&#x27;s fame and reputation, on the day of his burial all the workshops of the city closed in his honor.

== Modern reception ==
The art critic Paul George Konody wrote of Lippi that &quot;some of his qualities show him to be the most subtle psychologist of his time, the most modern in spirit of all the artists of the Renaissance&quot;.

<text>This is an alphabetized list of musicians notable for playing or having played jazz piano. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument&#x27;s combined melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic capabilities.

<text>Giovanni Antonio Canal (18 October 1697 – 19 April 1768), commonly known as Canaletto (), was an Italian painter from the Republic of Venice, considered an important member of the 18th-century Venetian school.

Painter of cityscapes or &quot;vedute&quot;, of Venice, Rome, and London, he also painted imaginary views (referred to as capricci), although the demarcation in his works between the real and the imaginary is never quite clearcut. He was further an important printmaker using the etching technique. In the period from 1746 to 1756, he worked in England, where he painted many views of London and other sites, including Warwick Castle and Alnwick Castle. He was highly successful in England, thanks to the British merchant and connoisseur Joseph &quot;Consul&quot; Smith, whose large collection of Canaletto&#x27;s works was sold to King George III in 1762.

==Early career==

He was born in Venice as the son of the painter Bernardo Canal, hence his mononym &quot;Canaletto&quot; (&quot;little Canal&quot;), and Artemisia Barbieri. Canaletto served an apprenticeship with his father and his brother of a theatrical scene painter. In 1718, having already taken part in designing sets for operas by Fortunato Chelleri, Giovanni Porto and Antonio Vivaldi, Canaletto travelled to Rome. During his time in Rome, he worked with his father producing the scenery for two operas by the composer Alessandro Scarlatti, &quot;Tito Sempronio Greco&quot; and &quot;Turno Aricino&quot; which were performed at the Teatro Catranica during the carnival season of 1720.

Canaletto was inspired by the Roman &quot;vedutista&quot; Giovanni Paolo Pannini, and started painting the daily life of the city and its people.

After returning from Rome in 1719, he began painting in his topographical style. His first known signed and dated work is &quot;Architectural Capriccio&quot; (1723, Milan, in a private collection). Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs, a well-regarded painter of urban cityscapes, he rapidly became his master&#x27;s equal.

In 1725, the painter Alessandro Marchesini, who was also the buyer for the Lucchese art collector Stefano Conti, had inquired about buying two more &#x27;views of Venice&#x27;, when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of &quot;Antonio Canale... it is like Carlevaris, but you can see the sun shining in it.&quot;

===Outdoor painting===
Much of Canaletto&#x27;s early artwork was painted &quot;from nature&quot;, differing from the then customary practice of completing paintings in the studio. Some of his later works do revert to this custom, as suggested by the tendency for distant figures to be painted as blobs of colour – an effect possibly produced by using a camera obscura, which blurs farther-away objects.
Also, his paintings are always notable for their accuracy, an example being his recording of the seasonal submerging of Venice in water and ice. In particular, his precise use of correct perspective has led experts in the past to believe that much of the detail in his paintings had been achieved by tracing the image off a camera obscura. It is known that Canaletto owned a camera obscura, but several experts today are of the opinion that he may have taken some inspiration from it, rather than actually using it for accurate photorealistic tracing in preparation for his paintings.

===Early and late work===
Canaletto&#x27;s early works remain his most coveted and, according to many authorities, his best. One of his early pieces is &quot;The Stonemason&#x27;s Yard&quot; (, the National Gallery, London) which depicts a humble working area of the city. It is regarded one of his finest works, and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823 and 1828.

Later, Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the Doge&#x27;s Palace. His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city&#x27;s pageantry and waning traditions, making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colours. For these qualities, his works may be said to have anticipated Impressionism.

His graphic print &quot;S. A. Giustina in Prà della Vale&quot; was found in the 2012 Munich Art Hoard.

==Work in England==


Many of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their Grand Tour, first through the agency of Owen Swiny, and later the banker Joseph Smith. It was Swiny in the late 1720s who encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city. Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice, who was appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. Smith later became the artist&#x27;s principal agent and patron, acquiring nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist&#x27;s works, which he sold to King George III in 1763.

In the 1740s, Canaletto&#x27;s market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice. Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of &quot;capricci&quot; (or architectural phantasies) (&quot;capriccio&quot; Italian for fancy) in his &quot;vedute ideali&quot;, but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market.

Whilst in England, between 1749 and 1752 Canaletto lived at number 41 Beak Street in London&#x27;s Soho district.

He remained in England until 1755, producing views of London (including several of the new Westminster Bridge, which was completed during his stay) and of his patrons&#x27; houses and castles. These included Northumberland House for Sir Hugh Smithson, Bt., who by marriage later became the 2nd Earl of Northumberland; and Warwick Castle for Lord Brooke, later 1st Earl of Warwick. Smithson was one of the commissioners of Westminster Bridge, and it is &quot;not impossible&quot; that he had encouraged Canaletto to come to England and record the beginning of the bridge&#x27;s life. His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself.

He was often expected to paint England in the fashion with which he had painted his native city. Canaletto&#x27;s painting began to suffer from repetitiveness, losing its fluidity, and becoming mechanical to the point that the English art critic George Vertue suggested that the man painting under the name &#x27;Canaletto&#x27; was an impostor. This may have been because Canaletto&#x27;s nephew, Bernardo Bellotto, was also using his uncle&#x27;s nickname; or more likely because the story had been spread by unscrupulous art dealers who had been passing off copies of Canaletto&#x27;s own work and were anxious to see him return to Venice. Historian Michael Levey described his work from this period as &quot;inhibited&quot;.

In order to refute this claim the artist, through an advertisement in a newspaper, invited &quot;any Gentleman&quot; to inspect his latest painting of St. James&#x27;s Park at his studio in Silver Street (now Beak Street) off Golden Square; however, his reputation never fully recovered in his lifetime.

After his return to Venice, Canaletto was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763 and appointed prior of the &quot;Collegio dei Pittori&quot;. He continued to paint until his death in 1768. In his later years, he often worked from old sketches, but he sometimes produced surprising new compositions. He was willing to make subtle alterations to topography for artistic effect.

He was buried at San Lio, Venice, the church where he was baptized.

==Market==
His students included his nephew Bernardo Bellotto, Francesco Guardi, Michele Marieschi, Gabriele Bella and Giuseppe Moretti. The painter, Giuseppe Bernardino Bison, was a follower of his style.

Joseph Smith sold much of his collection to George III, creating the bulk of the large collection of works by Canaletto owned by the Royal Collection. In 1762, George III paid £20,000 for Consul Smith&#x27;s collection of 50 paintings and 142 drawings. There are many examples of his work in other British collections, including several (19) at the Wallace Collection and a set of 24 in the dining room at Woburn Abbey. A large set of Canaletto works was also part of the collection of the Earls of Carlisle, however many were lost at the 1940 fire at Castle Howard and others were sold over the last century. Among those formerly at the Carlisle collection are &quot;The Bacino di San Marco: looking East&quot;, now at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (sold in 1939) and the pair &quot;Entrance to the Grand Canal from the Molo, Venice&quot; and &quot;The Square of Saint Mark&#x27;s, Venice&quot;, now at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC (sold in 1938). The last important venetian &quot;veduta&quot; at Castle Howard was by Bernardo Bellotto, &quot;A View of the Grand Canal Looking South from the Palazzo Foscari&quot;, which was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in July 2015 for £2.6 million.

Canaletto&#x27;s views always fetched high prices, and as early as the 18th century Catherine the Great and other European monarchs vied for his grandest paintings. The record price paid at auction for a Canaletto is £18.6 million for &quot;View of the Grand Canal from Palazzo Balbi to the Rialto&quot;, set at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in July 2005.

<text>Leonardo Leo (5 August 1694 – 31 October 1744), more correctly Leonardo Ortensio Salvatore de Leo, was a Baroque composer.

==Biography==
Leo was born in San Vito degli Schiavoni (currently known as San Vito dei Normanni, province of Brindisi) in the Apulia region, then part of the Kingdom of Naples.

He became a student at the Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini at Naples in 1703, and was a pupil first of Francesco Provenzale and later of Nicola Fago. It has been supposed that he was a pupil of Pitoni and Alessandro Scarlatti, but he could not possibly have studied with either of these composers, although he was undoubtedly influenced by their compositions. His earliest known work was a sacred drama, &quot;L&#x27;infedelta abbattuta&quot;, performed by his fellow-students in 1712.

In 1714 he produced, at the court theatre, an opera, &quot;Pisistrato&quot;, which was much admired.

He held various posts at the royal chapel, and continued to write for the stage, besides teaching at the conservatory. After adding comic scenes to Francesco Gasparini&#x27;s &quot;Bajazette&quot; in 1722 for performance at Naples, he composed comic operas in Neapolitan such as &quot;La&#x27;mpeca scoperta&quot; in 1723, and &quot;L&#x27;Alidoro&quot; in 1740.
His most famous comic opera was &quot;Amor vuol sofferenza&quot; (1739), better known as &quot;La Finta Frascatana&quot;, highly praised by De Brosses. He was equally distinguished as a composer of serious opera, &quot;Demofoonte&quot; (1735), &quot;Farnace&quot; (1737) and &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot; (1737) being his most famous works in this branch, and is still better known as a composer of sacred music.

He died of a stroke while engaged in the composition of new arias for a revival of &quot;La Finta Frascatana&quot;. Leo was the first of the Neapolitan school to obtain a complete mastery over modern harmonic counterpoint.

<text>The law of obligations is one branch of private law under the civil law legal system and so-called &quot;mixed&quot; legal systems. It is the body of rules that organizes and regulates the rights and duties arising between individuals. The specific rights and duties are referred to as &quot;obligations&quot;, and this area of law deals with their creation, effects and extinction.

An obligation is a legal bond (&quot;vinculum iuris&quot;) by which one or more parties (obligants) are bound to act or refrain from acting. An obligation thus imposes on the &quot;obligor&quot; a duty to perform, and simultaneously creates a corresponding right to demand performance by the &quot;obligee&quot; to whom performance is to be tendered.

==History==
The word originally derives from the Latin &quot;obligare&quot; which comes from the root &quot;lig&quot; which suggests being bound, as one is to God for instance in &quot;re-ligio&quot;. This term first appears in Plautus&#x27; play Truculentus at line 214.

Obligations did not originally form part of Roman Law, which mostly concerned issues of succession, property, and family relationships. It developed as a solution to a gap in the system, when one party committed a wrong against another party. These situations were originally governed by a basic customary law of revenge. This undesirable situation eventually developed into a system of liability where people were at first encouraged and then essentially forced to accept monetary compensation from the wrongdoer or their family instead of seeking vengeance. This signaled an important shift in the law away from vengeance and towards compensation. The state supported this effort by standardizing amounts for certain wrongs. Thus the earliest form of Obligation law derives out of what we would today call Delict.

However, liability in this form did not yet include the idea that the debtor &quot;owed&quot; monetary compensation to the creditor, it was merely a means of avoiding punishment. If the debtor or his family didn&#x27;t have the means to pay then the old rules still applied as outlined in the &quot;Twelve Tables&quot;, specifically Table III. This section, despite how harsh it may appear to us, was originally developed as a means to protect debtors from the excessive abuses of creditors.

==Definition==
Justinian first defines an obligation (&quot;obligatio&quot;) in his &quot;Institutes&quot;, Book 3, section 13 as &quot;a legal bond, with which we are bound by necessity of performing some act according to the laws of our State.&quot; He further separates the law of obligations into contracts, delicts, quasi-contracts, and quasi-delicts.

Nowadays, obligation, as applied under civilian law, means a legal tie (&quot;vinculum iuris&quot;) by which one or more parties (obligants) are bound to perform or refrain from performing specified conduct (prestation). Thus an obligation encompasses both sides of the equation, both the obligor&#x27;s duty to render prestation and the obligee&#x27;s right to receive prestation. It differs from the common-law concept of obligation which only encompasses the duty aspect.

Every obligation has four essential requisites otherwise known as the elements of obligation. They are:
# the : obligant duty-bound to fulfill the obligation; he who has a duty.
# the : obligant entitled to demand the fulfillment of the obligation; he who has a right.
# the subject matter, the prestation: the performance to be tendered.
# a legal bond, the juris: the cause that binds or connects the obligants to the prestation.

==Classification in Roman Law==
===Sources===
Obligations arising out of the will of the parties are called &quot;voluntary&quot;, and those imposed by operation of law are called &quot;involuntary&quot;. Sometimes these are called conventional and obediential. The events giving rise to obligations may be further distinguished into specified categories. 
* voluntary:
** unilateral promise (&quot;pollicitatio&quot;) - undertaking by promisor only to perform, not requiring the promisee&#x27;s agreement
** contract
** quasi-contract
*** &quot;negotiorum gestio&quot; - duty to repay an intervenor (&quot;gestor&quot;) who has managed the affairs or property of another (&quot;dominus negotii&quot;) who was unable to so
*** &quot;solutio indebiti&quot; - undue payment or delivery of a thing to another (&quot;accipiens&quot;), who is then obligated to return the thing to the payer (&quot;solvens&quot;)
* involuntary:
** delicts and quasi-delicts (equivalent to the common-law tort).
** unjust enrichment (&quot;condictio indebiti&quot;)

One of the first known classifications was made by Gaius in his &quot;Institutes&quot;, who divided obligations into obligations &quot;ex contractu&quot; (obligations arising from legal actions) and obligations &quot;ex delicto&quot; (obligations arising from illegal, unlawful actions). However, since this classification was too vague, in his work &quot;Res cottidinanae&quot; Gaius classified all obligations into the aforementioned obligations &quot;ex contractu&quot; and obligations &quot;ex delicto&quot;, as well as obligations &quot;ex variis causarum figuris&quot;, which was a heterogeneous category that was supposed to include all the cases of obligations not arising from delicts or contracts.

The most precise Roman classification of obligations was featured in Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; (not to be confused by Gaius&#x27; &quot;Institutes&quot;), which classified them as obligations arising from contracts (&quot;ex contractu&quot;), those arising from delicts (&quot;ex maleficio&quot;), those arising from quasi-contracts (&quot;quasi ex contractu&quot;), and those arising from quasi-delicts (&quot;quasi ex maleficio&quot;).

====Contracts====

A contract can be broadly defined as an agreement that is enforceable at law. Gaius classified contracts into four categories which are: contracts &quot;consensu&quot;, verbal contracts, contracts &quot;re&quot;, and contracts &quot;litteris&quot;. But this classification cannot cover all the contracts, such as pacts and innominate contracts; thus, it is no longer used. According to many modern legal scholars, the most important classification of contracts is that of contracts &quot;consensu,&quot; which only require the consent of wills to create obligations, and formal contracts, which have to be concluded in a specific form in order to be valid (for example, in many European countries a contract regulating the purchase of real estate must be concluded in a special written form that is validated by a public notary).

==== Delicts ====
====Quasi-contracts====
Quasi-contracts are supposed to be sources of obligations very similar to contracts, but the main difference is that they are not created by an agreement of wills. The main cases are &quot;negotiorum gestio&quot; (conducting of another person&#x27;s affairs without their authorization), unjust enrichment, and &quot;solutio indebiti&quot;. This Roman classification is quite controversial for today&#x27;s standards, since many of these cases would be considered as completely different from contracts (most notably unjust enrichment), and would instead be classified as delicts or special sources of obligations. They are formed by implication from circumstances regardless of the assent or dissent of parties. They are called quasi-contracts. The following are the examples of quasi-contractual obligations under the Roman law;

====Quasi-delicts====

The designation comprised a group of actions that are very similar to delicts, but lacking one of key elements of delicts. It includes &quot;res suspensae&quot;, responsibility for things poured or thrown out of buildings, responsibility of shippers/innkeepers/stablekeepers, and erring judges. For example, the responsibility of innkeepers creates obligations when certain things left by guests in the lodging are destroyed, damaged or lost by the innkeeper&#x27;s assistants or employees. In this case, the innkeeper is responsible for the damages to the guest&#x27;s property, even though he did not cause them personally.

===Subject matter===
Obligations are classified according to the nature of the performance (prestation):
* real obligation - related somehow to immovable property
* obligation to give - obligations to give or possession, or enjoyment
** specific obligation - delivery of a determinate thing when it is particularly designated or physically separated from all others of the same class
** generic obligation - delivery of a generic thing
* personal obligations - undertakings either to do or not do all kinds of work or service
** positive personal obligation - undertaking or obligation to do
** negative personal obligation - forbearance or obligation to not do

<text>Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni (Rieti, 18 March 1657 – Rome, 1 February 1743) was an Italian organist and composer. He became one of the leading musicians in Rome during the late Baroque era, the first half of the 18th century.

==Life==
Taken to Rome as an infant, he began vocal study with Pompeo Natali at the age of five and sang in the choir of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini from age eight. At Santi Apostoli he sang and studied counterpoint with Francesco Foggia, where his early compositions were performed. By age sixteen he was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Santa Maria Maggiore, Monterotondo, a historic church near Rome. In 1673 as &quot;maestro&quot; for the cathedral at Assisi he began intensive study of the works of Palestrina, and in 1676 moved to the cathedral at Rieti.

In 1677 he returned to Rome for a lifelong appointment as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Basilica of San Marco. In addition he held a series of prestigious positions as &quot;maestro&quot; for Basilica dei Santi Apostoli, Rome (from 1686), at St. John Lateran (from 1708, where Palestrina had served from 1555 to 1560), and for the Cappella Giulia at St. Peter’s (from 1719, immediately following Domenico Scarlatti), and &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome. For the chapter of San Lorenzo in Damaso, he produced major performances over thirty-five years for the music-loving Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, whose extensive circle of artists included Arcangelo Corelli, George Frideric Handel, both Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, Bernardo Pasquini, and Filippo Amadei.

==Works==
His contributions to liturgical music in Rome were profound as composer, organist, &quot;maestro di capella&quot;, writer on music theory and history, and as &quot;esaminatori dei maestri&quot; for the Academy of St. Cecilia. He was extremely prolific, with some 325 masses, 800 Psalm settings and 235 motets among the 3500 compositions listed by his pupil and biographer, Girolamo Chiti. He prepared a complete year of music for St. Peter’s, with settings for the masses and offices of every Sunday and holy day.

Pitoni’s early works are brilliant examples of his genius in the Roman contrapuntal style of Palestrina. In later years he moved toward more homophonic textures with polychoral elements. His use of &quot;stile concertato&quot; also included solo sections and concertante instrumental parts. It is said that his immense facility allowed him to compose the parts of a 16-voice mass separately, without use of a score. To modern ears and eyes these compositions may seem dull and even repetitious. However, given typical performance practices in the early 18th century – vocal ornamentation (&quot;divisions&quot;), instrumental participation, antiphonal location for polychoral elements, just intonation, and varied vocal colors – even the homophonic works must have made a strong impression in the highly reverberative church interiors of Rome. At the end of his life he was preparing a mass for twelve choirs, left incomplete at his death. He was buried in the Pitoni family vault in the Basilica of San Marco, where he had served for some 66 years.
His best known work is the &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; a 16 in 4 choirs.

<doc id="214040" wikidata="Q1976524" url="?curid=214040" title="Latrocinium">
<text>Latrocinium (from Latin &quot;latro&quot;, &quot;bandit&quot;, ultimately from Greek &quot;latron&quot;, &quot;pay&quot; or &quot;hire&quot;) was a war not preceded by a formal declaration of war as understood in Roman law; thus guerrilla warfare conducted against Rome was a form of &quot;latrocinium&quot;. It is typically translated into English as &quot;banditry&quot; or &quot;brigandage&quot;, but in antiquity encompassed a wider range of subversive or anti-authoritarian actions, especially slave rebellions organized under charismatic leaders. In designating acts of violence that have ideological motives instead of or in addition to material gain, the modern distinction between terrorism and war may be a more illuminating comparison for the 21st century. The Greek term was &quot;leisteia&quot;; Plato and Aristotle regarded banditry as a way of life, like fishing or hunting.

==Ecclesiastical councils as &quot;latrocinia&quot;==
In ecclesiastical Latin, &quot;latrocinium&quot; is a term of abuse for ecumenical councils regarded as renegade or subversive of canon law, especially the second Council of Ephesus – dubbed the &quot;Robber Council&quot;. &quot;(Latrocinium Ephesinum)&quot; in 449. The Third Council of Sirmium in 357, the Council of Hieria in 754, and the Synod of Pistoia in 1786, were also each described by their opponents as a &quot;latrocinium&quot;. Some also regarded the fourth Council of Constantinople (879–880) as a &quot;latrocinium&quot;.

==Medieval usage==
In the Middle Ages, &quot;latrocinium&quot; was a war without just cause, or piracy.

<doc id="214042" wikidata="Q368264" url="?curid=214042" title="Charles Villiers Stanford">
<text>Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (30 September 1852 – 29 March 1924) was an Anglo-Irish composer, music teacher, and conductor of the late Romantic era. Born to a well-off and highly musical family in Dublin, Stanford was educated at the University of Cambridge before studying music in Leipzig and Berlin. He was instrumental in raising the status of the Cambridge University Musical Society, attracting international stars to perform with it.

While still an undergraduate, Stanford was appointed organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, he was one of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also Professor of Music at Cambridge. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of Brahms. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds Triennial Music Festival.

Stanford composed a substantial number of concert works, including seven symphonies, but his best-remembered pieces are his choral works for church performance, chiefly composed in the Anglican tradition. He was a dedicated composer of opera, but none of his nine completed operas has endured in the general repertory. Some critics regarded Stanford, together with Hubert Parry and Alexander Mackenzie, as responsible for a renaissance in music from the British Isles. However, despite his conspicuous success as a composer in the last two decades of the 19th century, his music was eclipsed in the 20th century by that of Edward Elgar as well as former pupils.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Stanford was born in Dublin, the only son of John James Stanford and his second wife Mary, &quot;née&quot; Henn. John Stanford was a prominent Dublin lawyer, Examiner to the Court of Chancery in Ireland and Clerk of the Crown for County Meath. His wife was the third daughter of William Henn, Master of the Court of Chancery in Ireland and his wife Susanna Lovett of Liscombe House, Buckinghamshire, and granddaughter of the judge William Henn. Both parents were accomplished amateur musicians; John Stanford was a cellist and a noted bass singer who was chosen to perform the title role in Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; at the Irish premiere in 1847. Mary Stanford, &quot;a lady 
of great charm&quot;, was an amateur pianist, capable of playing the solo parts in concertos at Dublin concerts.

The young Stanford was given a conventional education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics to the exclusion of other subjects. Stanford&#x27;s parents encouraged the boy&#x27;s precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, &quot;She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day at the end of my lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease.&quot; One of the young Stanford&#x27;s earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.

In the 1860s Dublin received occasional visits from international stars, and Stanford was able to hear famous performers such as Joseph Joachim, Henri Vieuxtemps and Adelina Patti. The annual visit of the Italian Opera Company from London, led by Giulia Grisi, Giovanni Matteo Mario and later Thérèse Tietjens, gave Stanford a taste for opera that remained with him all his life. When he was ten, his parents took him to London for the summer, where he stayed with his mother&#x27;s uncle in Mayfair. While there he took composition lessons from the composer and teacher Arthur O&#x27;Leary, and piano lessons from Ernst Pauer, professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). On his return to Dublin, his godmother having left Ireland, he took lessons from Henrietta Flynn, another former Leipzig Conservatory pupil of Moscheles, and later from Robert Stewart, organist of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, as well as from a third Moscheles pupil, Michael Quarry. During his second spell in London two years later, he met the composer Arthur Sullivan and the musical administrator and writer George Grove, who later played important parts in his career.

John Stanford hoped that his son would follow him into the legal profession but accepted his decision to pursue music as a career. However, he stipulated that Stanford should have a conventional university education before going on to musical studies abroad. Stanford tried unsuccessfully for a classics scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, but gained an organ scholarship, and later a classics scholarship, at Queens&#x27; College. By the time he went up to Cambridge in 1870, he had written a substantial number of compositions, including vocal music, both sacred and secular, and orchestral works (a rondo for cello and orchestra and a concert overture).

=== Cambridge ===
Stanford immersed himself in the musical life of the university to the detriment of his Latin and Greek studies. He composed religious and secular vocal works, a piano concerto, and incidental music for Longfellow&#x27;s play &quot;A Spanish Student&quot;. In November 1870 he appeared as piano soloist with the Cambridge University Musical Society (CUMS), and quickly became its assistant conductor and a committee member. The society had declined in excellence since its foundation in 1843. Its choir consisted solely of men and boys; the lack of women singers severely limited the works that the society could present. Stanford was unable to persuade the members to admit women, and so he staged what &quot;The Musical Times&quot; called &quot;a bloodless revolution&quot;. In February 1872 he co-founded a mixed choir, the Amateur Vocal Guild, whose performances immediately put those of the CUMS singers in the shade. The members of CUMS rapidly changed their minds, and agreed to a merger of the two choirs, with women given associate membership of the society.

The conductor of the combined choir was John Larkin Hopkins, who was also organist of Trinity College. He became ill and handed over the conductorship to Stanford in 1873. Stanford was also appointed Hopkins&#x27;s deputy organist at Trinity, and moved from Queens&#x27; to Trinity in April 1873. In the summer of that year Stanford made his first trip to continental Europe. He went to Bonn for the Schumann Festival held there, where he met Joachim and Brahms. His growing love of the music of Schumann and Brahms marked him as a classicist at a time when many music-lovers were divided into the classical or the modernist camps, the latter represented by the music of Liszt and Wagner. Stanford was not constrained by the fashion for belonging to one camp or the other; he immensely admired &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; though he was unenthusiastic about some of Wagner&#x27;s other works. After leaving Bonn he returned home by way of Switzerland and then Paris, where he saw Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Le prophète&quot;.

Hopkins&#x27;s illness proved fatal, and after his death the Trinity authorities invited Stanford to take over as organist of the college. He accepted with the proviso that he was to be released each year for a spell of musical study in Germany. The fellows of the college resolved on 21 February 1874:

Two days after his appointment, Stanford took the final examinations for his classics degree. He ranked 65th of 66, and was awarded a third-class degree.

=== Leipzig ===

On the recommendation of Sir William Sterndale Bennett, former professor of music at Cambridge and now director of the Royal Academy of Music, Stanford went to Leipzig in the summer of 1874 for lessons with Carl Reinecke, professor of composition and piano at the Leipzig Conservatory. The composer Thomas Dunhill commented that by 1874 it was &quot;the tail-end of the Leipzig ascendancy, when the great traditions of Mendelssohn had already begun
to fade.&quot;
Nevertheless, Stanford did not seriously consider studying anywhere else. Neither Dublin nor London offered any comparable musical training; the most prestigious British music school, the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), was at that time hidebound and reactionary. He was dismayed to find in Leipzig that Bennett had recommended him to a German pedant no more progressive than the teachers at the RAM. Stanford said of Reinecke, &quot;Of all the dry musicians I have ever known he was the most desiccated. He had not a good word for any contemporary composer... He loathed Wagner ... sneered at Brahms and had no enthusiasm of any sort.&quot; Stanford&#x27;s biographer Paul Rodmell suggests that Reinecke&#x27;s ultra-conservatism may have been unexpectedly good for his pupil &quot;as it may have encouraged Stanford to kick against the traces.&quot; During his time in Leipzig Stanford took piano lessons from Robert Papperitz (1826–1903), organist of the city&#x27;s Nikolaikirche, whom he found more helpful.

Among Stanford&#x27;s compositions in 1874 was a setting of part one of Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;. He intended to set the entire poem, but gave up, defeated by Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;numerous but unconnected characters.&quot; Stanford ignored this and other early works when assigning opus numbers in his mature years. The earliest compositions in his official list of works are a four-movement Suite for piano and a Toccata for piano, which both date from 1875.

After a second spell in Leipzig with Reinecke in 1875, which was no more productive than the first, Stanford was recommended by Joachim to study in Berlin the following year with Friedrich Kiel, whom Stanford found &quot;a master at once sympathetic and able ... I learnt more from him in three months, than from all the others in three years.&quot;

=== Rising composer ===

Returning to Cambridge in the intervals of his studies in Germany, Stanford resumed his work as conductor of CUMS. He found the society in good shape under his deputy, Eaton Faning, and able to tackle demanding new works. In 1876 the society presented one of the first performances in Britain of the Brahms &quot;Requiem&quot;. In 1877 CUMS came to national attention when it presented the first British performance of Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony.

During the same period, Stanford was becoming known as a composer. He was composing prolifically, though he later withdrew some of his works from these years, including a violin concerto which, according to Rodmell, suffered from &quot;undistinguished thematic material&quot;. In 1875 his First Symphony won the second prize in a competition held at the Alexandra Palace for symphonies by British composers, although he had to wait a further two years to hear the work performed. In the same year Stanford directed the first performance of his oratorio &quot;The Resurrection&quot;, given by CUMS. At the request of Alfred Tennyson, he wrote incidental music for Tennyson&#x27;s drama &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, performed at the Lyceum Theatre, London in April 1876.

In April 1878, despite the disapproval of his father, Stanford married Jane Anna Maria Wetton, known as Jennie, a singer whom he had met when she was studying in Leipzig. She was the daughter of Henry Champion Wetton of Joldwynds in Surrey, who had died in 1870. They had a daughter, Geraldine Mary, born in 1883, and a son, Guy Desmond, born in 1885.

In 1878 and 1879 Stanford worked on his first opera, &quot;The Veiled Prophet&quot;, to a libretto by his friend William Barclay Squire. It was based on a poem by Thomas Moore with characters including a virgin priestess and a mystic prophet, and a plot that culminates in poisoning and stabbing. Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should try to have it staged in Germany: &quot;Its success will (unfortunately) have much greater chances here if accepted abroad.&quot; Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas, Rosa added, &quot;If the work was of the Pinafore style it would be quite another matter.&quot; Stanford had greatly enjoyed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Cox and Box&quot;, but &quot;The Veiled Prophet&quot; was intended to be a serious work of high drama and romance.
Stanford had made many useful contacts during his months in Germany, and his friend the conductor Ernst Frank got the piece staged at the Königliches Schauspiel in Hanover in 1881. Reviewing the premiere for &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, Stanford&#x27;s friend J A Fuller Maitland wrote, &quot;Mr. Stanford&#x27;s style of instrumentation ... is built more or less on that of Schumann; while his style of dramatic treatment bears more resemblance to Meyerbeer than to that of any other master.&quot; Other reviews were mixed, and the opera had to wait until 1893 for its English premiere. Stanford nevertheless continued to seek operatic success throughout his career. In his lifelong enthusiasm for opera he differed strikingly from his contemporary Hubert Parry, who made one attempt at composing opera and then renounced the genre.
By the early 1880s, Stanford was becoming a major figure in the British musical scene. His only major rivals were seen as Sullivan, Frederic Hymen Cowen, Parry, Alexander Mackenzie and Arthur Goring Thomas. Sullivan was by this time viewed with suspicion in high-minded musical circles for composing comic rather than grand operas; Cowen was regarded more as a conductor than as a composer; and the other three, though seen as promising, had not so far made a clear mark as Stanford had done. Stanford helped Parry in particular to gain recognition, commissioning incidental music from him for a Cambridge production of Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Birds&quot; and a symphony (the &quot;Cambridge&quot;) for the musical society. At Cambridge Stanford continued to raise the profile of CUMS, as well as his own, by securing appearances by leading international musicians including Joachim, Hans Richter, Alfredo Piatti and Edward Dannreuther. The society attracted further attention by premiering works by Cowen, Parry, Mackenzie, Goring Thomas and others. Stanford was also making an impression in his capacity as organist of Trinity, raising musical standards and composing what his biographer Jeremy Dibble calls &quot;some highly distinctive church music&quot; including a Service in B (1879), the anthem &quot;The Lord is my shepherd&quot; (1886) and three Latin motets including &quot;Beati quorum via&quot; (1888).

In the first half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, &quot;Savonarola&quot;, and &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot;. The former was well received at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, &quot;It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic.&quot; The most severe public criticism was in &quot;The Theatre&quot;, whose reviewer wrote, &quot;The book of &quot;Savonarola&quot; is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. &quot;Savonarola&quot; has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [Stanford&#x27;s] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation.&quot; &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot; had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before &quot;Savonarola&quot; was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford&#x27;s debt to &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely.&quot; In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had &quot;just such a &#x27;book&#x27; as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy.&quot;

In 1883, the Royal College of Music was set up to replace the short-lived and unsuccessful National Training School for Music (NTSM). Neither the NTSM nor the longer-established Royal Academy of Music had provided adequate musical training for professional orchestral players, and the founder-director of the college, George Grove, was determined that the new institution should succeed in doing so. His two principal allies in this undertaking were the violinist Henry Holmes and Stanford. In a study of the founding of the college, David Wright notes that Stanford had two main reasons for supporting Grove&#x27;s aim. The first was his belief that a capable college orchestra was essential to give students of composition the chance to experience the sound of their music. His second reason was the severe contrast between the competence of German orchestras and the performance of their British counterparts. He accepted Grove&#x27;s offer of the posts of professor of composition and (with Holmes) conductor of the college orchestra. He held the professorship for the rest of his life; among the best known of his many pupils were Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Rebecca Clarke, Frank Bridge and Arthur Bliss. Rated by Stanford as his most talented student was the English pianist and composer William Hurlstone.
Stanford was never an easy-going teacher. He insisted on one-to-one tutorials, and worked his pupils hard. One of them, Herbert Howells, recalled, &quot;Corner any Stanford pupil you like, and ask him to confess the sins he most hated being discovered in by his master. He will tell you &#x27;slovenliness&#x27; and &#x27;vulgarity.&#x27; When these went into the teacher&#x27;s room they came out, badly damaged. Against compromise with dubious material or workmanship Stanford stubbornly set his face.&quot; Another pupil, Edgar Bainton, recalled:
To Stanford&#x27;s regret, many of his pupils who achieved eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke&#x27;s conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, &quot;In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, one is tempted to wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution.&quot; The works of some of Stanford&#x27;s pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford&#x27;s never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford&#x27;s greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.

In 1887 Stanford was appointed professor of music at Cambridge in succession to Sir George Macfarren who died in October of that year. Up to this time, the university had awarded music degrees to candidates who had not been undergraduates at Cambridge; all that was required was to pass the university&#x27;s music examinations. Stanford was determined to end this practice, and after six years he persuaded the university authorities to agree. Three years&#x27; study at the university became a prerequisite for sitting the bachelor of music examinations.

=== Conductor and composer ===
During the last decades of the 19th century, Stanford&#x27;s academic duties did not prevent him from composing or performing. He was appointed conductor of the Bach Choir, London, in 1885, succeeding its founding conductor Otto Goldschmidt. He held the post until 1902. Hans von Bülow conducted the German premiere of Stanford&#x27;s &quot;Irish&quot; Symphony in Hamburg in January 1888, and was sufficiently impressed by the work to programme it in Berlin shortly afterwards. Richter conducted it in Vienna, and Mahler later conducted it in New York. For the Theatre Royal, Cambridge, Stanford composed incidental music for productions of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Eumenides&quot; (1885), and Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Tyrannos&quot; (1887). &quot;The Times&quot; said of the former, &quot;Mr. Stanford&#x27;s music is dramatically significant, as well as beautiful in itself. It has, moreover, that quality so rare among modern composers – style.&quot; In both sets of music Stanford made extensive use of leitmotifs, in the manner of Wagner; the critic of &quot;The Times&quot; noted the Wagnerian character of the prelude to &quot;Oedipus&quot;.

In the 1890s, Bernard Shaw writing as a music critic of &quot;The World&quot;, voiced mixed feelings about Stanford. In Shaw&#x27;s view, the best of Stanford&#x27;s works displayed an uninhibited, Irish, character. The critic was dismissive of the composer&#x27;s solemn Victorian choral music. In July 1891, Shaw&#x27;s column was full of praise for Stanford&#x27;s capacity for spirited tunes, declaring that Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte should engage him to succeed Sullivan as the composer of Savoy operas. In October of the same year, Shaw attacked Stanford&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Eden&quot;, bracketing the composer with Parry and Mackenzie as a mutual admiration society, purveying &quot;sham classics&quot;:

To Fuller Maitland, the trio of composers lampooned by Shaw were the leaders of an English musical renaissance (although neither Stanford nor Mackenzie was English). This view persisted in some academic circles for many years.

Stanford returned to opera in 1893, with an extensively revised and shortened version of &quot;The Veiled Prophet&quot;. It had its British premiere at Covent Garden in July. His friend Fuller Maitland was by this time the chief music critic of &quot;The Times&quot;, and the paper&#x27;s review of the opera was laudatory. According to Fuller Maitland &quot;The Veiled Prophet&quot; was the best novelty of an opera season that had also included Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Djamileh&quot; and Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;I Rantzau&quot;. Stanford&#x27;s next opera was &quot;Shamus O&#x27;Brien&quot; (1896), a comic opera to a libretto by George H. Jessop. The conductor was the young Henry Wood, who recalled in his memoirs that the producer, Sir Augustus Harris, managed to quell the dictatorial composer and prevent him from interfering with the staging. Stanford attempted to give Wood lessons in conducting, but the young man was unimpressed. The opera was successful, running for 82 consecutive performances. The work was given in German translation in Breslau in 1907; Thomas Beecham thought it &quot;a colourful, racy work&quot;, and revived it in his 1910 opéra comique season at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London.
At the end of 1894, Grove retired from the Royal College of Music. Parry was chosen to succeed him, and although Stanford wholeheartedly congratulated his friend on his appointment, their relations soon deteriorated. Stanford was known as a hot-tempered and quarrelsome man. Grove had written of a board meeting at the Royal College &quot;where somehow the spirit of the d----l himself had been working in Stanford all the time – as it sometimes does, making him so nasty and quarrelsome and contradictious as no one but he can be! He is a most remarkably clever and able fellow, full of resource and power – no doubt of that – but one has to purchase it often at a very dear price.&quot; Parry suffered worse at Stanford&#x27;s hands with frequent rows, deeply upsetting to the highly strung Parry. Some of their rows were caused by Stanford&#x27;s reluctance to accept the authority of his old friend and protégé, but on other occasions Parry seriously provoked Stanford, notably in 1895 when he reduced the funding for Stanford&#x27;s orchestral classes.

In 1898, Sullivan, ageing and unwell, resigned as conductor of the Leeds triennial music festival, a post which he had held since 1880. He believed that Stanford&#x27;s motive for accepting the conductorship of the Leeds Philharmonic Society the previous year was to position himself to take over the festival. Stanford later felt obliged to write to &quot;The Times&quot;, denying that he had been party to a conspiracy to oust Sullivan. Sullivan was by then thought to be a dull conductor of other composers&#x27; music, and although Stanford&#x27;s work as a conductor was not without its critics, he was appointed in Sullivan&#x27;s place. He remained in charge until 1910. His compositions for the festival included &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot; (1904), &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; (1907) and &quot;Songs of the Fleet&quot; (1910). New works by other composers presented at Leeds during Stanford&#x27;s years in charge included pieces by Parry, Mackenzie, and seven of Stanford&#x27;s former pupils. The best-known new work from Stanford&#x27;s time is probably Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Sea Symphony&quot;, premiered in 1910.

=== 20th century ===

In 1901 Stanford returned once again to opera, with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, to a libretto by Julian Sturgis that was exceptionally faithful to Shakespeare&#x27;s original. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented, &quot;Not even in the &quot;Falstaff&quot; of Arrigo Boito and Giuseppe Verdi have the characteristic charm, the ripe and pungent individuality of the original comedy been more sedulously preserved.&quot;

Despite good notices for the opera, Stanford&#x27;s star was waning. In the first decade of the century, his music became eclipsed by that of a younger composer, Edward Elgar. In the words of the music scholar Robert Anderson, Stanford &quot;had his innings with continental reputation in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, but then Elgar bowled him out.&quot; When Elgar was struggling for recognition in the 1890s, Stanford had been supportive of his younger colleague, conducting his music, putting him forward for a Cambridge doctorate, and proposing him for membership of the exclusive London club, the Athenaeum. He was, however, put out when Elgar&#x27;s success at home and abroad eclipsed his own, with Richard Strauss (whom Stanford detested) praising Elgar as the first progressive English composer. When Elgar was appointed professor of music at Birmingham University in 1904, Stanford wrote him a letter that the recipient found &quot;odious&quot;. Elgar retaliated in his inaugural lecture with remarks about composers of rhapsodies, widely seen as denigrating Stanford. Stanford later counter-attacked in his book &quot;A History of Music&quot;, writing of Elgar, &quot;Cut off from his contemporaries by his religion and his want of regular academic training, he was lucky enough to enter the field and find the preliminary ploughing done.&quot;

Though bitter about being sidelined, Stanford continued to compose. Between the turn of the century and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 his new works included a violin concerto (1901), a clarinet concerto (1902), a sixth and a seventh (and last) symphony (1906 and 1911), and his second piano concerto (1911). In 1916 he wrote his penultimate opera, &quot;The Critic&quot;. It was a setting of Sheridan&#x27;s comedy of the same name, with the original text left mostly intact by the librettist, L. Cairns James. The work was well received at the premiere at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, and was taken up later in the year by Beecham, who staged it in Manchester and London.

=== Last years ===
The First World War had a severe effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air raids, and had to move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were casualties of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement at the end of 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford&#x27;s magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

After the war, Stanford handed over much of the direction of the RCM&#x27;s orchestra to Adrian Boult, but continued to teach at the college. He gave occasional public lectures, including one on &quot;Some Recent Tendencies in Composition&quot;, in January 1921 which was belligerently hostile to most of the music of the generation after his own. His last public appearance was on 5 March 1921 conducting Frederick Ranalow and the Royal Choral Society in his new cantata, &quot;At the Abbey Gate&quot;. Reviews were polite but unenthusiastic. &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;we could not feel that the music had enough emotion behind it&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; thought it &quot;quite appealing even though one feels it to be more facile than powerful.&quot;

In September 1922, Stanford completed the sixth &quot;Irish Rhapsody&quot;, his final work. Two weeks later he celebrated his 70th birthday; thereafter his health declined. On 17 March 1924 he suffered a stroke and on 29 March he died at his home in London, survived by his wife and children. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 2 April and his ashes were buried in Westminster Abbey the following day. The orchestra of the Royal College of Music, conducted by Boult, played music by Stanford, ending the service with a funeral march that he had written for Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Becket&quot; in 1893. The grave is in the north choir aisle of the Abbey, near the graves of Henry Purcell, John Blow and William Sterndale Bennett. &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;the conjunction of the music of Stanford with that of his great predecessors showed how thoroughly as composer he belonged to their line&quot;.

Stanford&#x27;s last opera, &quot;The Travelling Companion&quot;, composed during the war, was premiered by amateur performers at the David Lewis Theatre, Liverpool in 1925 with a reduced orchestra. The work was given complete at Bristol in 1928 and at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London, in 1935.

=== Honours ===
Stanford received many honours, including honorary doctorates from Oxford (1883), Cambridge (1888), Durham (1894), Leeds (1904), and Trinity College, Dublin (1921). He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. In 1904 he was elected a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts, Berlin.

== Works ==
Stanford composed about 200 works, including seven symphonies, about 40 choral works, nine operas, 11 concertos and 28 chamber works, as well as songs, piano pieces, incidental music, and organ works. He suppressed most of his earliest compositions; the earliest of works that he chose to include in his catalogue date from 1875.

Throughout his career as a composer, Stanford&#x27;s technical mastery was rarely in doubt. The composer Edgar Bainton said of him, &quot;Whatever opinions may be held upon Stanford&#x27;s music, and they are many and various, it is, I think, always recognised that he was a master of means. Everything he turned his hand to always &#x27;comes off. On the day of Stanford&#x27;s death, one former pupil, Gustav Holst, said to another, Herbert Howells, &quot;The one man who could get any one of us out of a technical mess is now gone from us.&quot;

After Stanford&#x27;s death, most of his music was quickly forgotten, with the exception of his works for church performances. His &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; and &quot;Requiem&quot; held their place in the choral repertoire, the latter championed by Sir Thomas Beecham. Stanford&#x27;s two sets of sea songs and the partsong &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; were still performed from time to time, but even his most popular opera, &quot;Shamus O&#x27;Brien&quot; came to seem old fashioned with its &quot;stage-Irish&quot; vocabulary. However, in his 2002 study of Stanford, Dibble writes that the music, increasingly available on disc if not in live performance, still has the power to surprise. In Dibble&#x27;s view, the frequent charge that Stanford is &quot;Brahms and water&quot; was disproved once the symphonies, concertos, much of the chamber music and many of the songs became available for reappraisal when recorded for compact disc. In 2002, Rodmell&#x27;s study of Stanford included a discography running to 16 pages.

The criticism most often made of Stanford&#x27;s music by writers from Shaw onwards is that his music lacks passion. Shaw praised &quot;Stanford the Celt&quot; and abominated &quot;Stanford the Professor&quot;, who reined in the emotions of the Celt. In Stanford&#x27;s church music, the critic Nicholas Temperley finds &quot;a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience, but one that is perhaps lacking in deeply felt religious impulse.&quot; In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do so. Like Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford had a real gift, but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that &quot;only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity.&quot;

=== Orchestral ===
The commentator Richard Whitehouse writes that Stanford&#x27;s seven symphonies embody both the strengths and limitations of his music, displaying &quot;a compositional rigour and expertise matched only by his older contemporary ... Parry, while seeming content to remain well within the stylistic ambit of Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms.&quot; Whitehouse comments that although Stanford&#x27;s symphonic construction is conventional, &quot;an often subtle approach to movement forms and resourceful orchestration make his symphonies worth exploring.&quot;

Stanford&#x27;s first two symphonies (1876 and 1879) were not published and were excluded from his catalogue of works. His Symphony No. 1 was written for a competition offered by the proprietors of the Alexandra Palace. It received second prize but was only performed once in his lifetime.

The Third Symphony in F minor, known as the &quot;Irish&quot;, was first performed in 1887. It was conducted by Mahler in 1911 in New York (Stanford however did not reciprocate, disliking most &#x27;modern&#x27; music, especially Ravel, Debussy and Stravinsky), and the Third remained the most popular of Stanford&#x27;s symphonies during his lifetime. In his study of Stanford&#x27;s works, John Porte refers to it as &quot;full of the spirit and tunes of his country ... with its contrasting expressions of jollity and sad beauty&quot;. In this, as in many of his works, Stanford incorporated genuine Irish folk tunes. Like Parry and Mackenzie, but unlike Sullivan and Elgar, Stanford liked and respected folk songs.

He generally avoided programmatic music, but his Sixth Symphony, composed &quot;in memoriam&quot; G. F. Watts, was, Stanford acknowledged, inspired by Watts&#x27;s sculptures and paintings.

Of Stanford&#x27;s other orchestral works, his six &quot;Irish Rhapsodies&quot; all date from the 20th century, the first from 1901 and the last from the year before his death. Two of the sets feature solo instruments along with the orchestra: the third (cello) and the sixth (violin). In Dibble&#x27;s view some of the concertante works such as the First Piano Concerto (1894) and the Violin Concerto of 1899 are in their orchestration and their lyricism as much in the tradition of Mendelssohn as of Brahms, with whom Stanford&#x27;s music is often compared.

=== Chamber works ===
Stanford&#x27;s chamber music, which as Dibble notes even Shaw praised, has not entered the general repertoire but is well crafted. Dibble singles out the Three Intermezzi for clarinet and piano (1879), the Serenade (Nonet) of 1905, and the Clarinet Sonata (1911) with its touching lament. Dibble writes that while his Violin Sonata No. 1 was still influenced by Beethoven and Schumann, his Violin Sonata No. 2, composed c. 1898 after studies in Germany including works by Brahms, in &quot;seamless sonata construction gives the impression of a free form&quot;. Writing of the First String Quintet, Porte calls it a sonorous and warm-hearted sort of work, constructed on fairly classical lines, and notes that the character and construction are typical of the composer. Porte comments similarly on other chamber works, including the Second Piano Trio: &quot;This is a typical Stanfordian work. It is sonorously scored, classical in outlook, and contains many passages of an expressive and somewhat poetical freshness. There are no very special features to note, but the work is one that makes a useful and interesting item.&quot;

=== Church music ===
While much of Stanford&#x27;s music has been forgotten, many of his ecclesiastical works have retained a higher profile. In &quot;Music in Britain&quot;, one of the few books to deal with Stanford&#x27;s music in detail, Nicholas Temperley writes that it is due to Stanford that settings of the Anglican church services regained their &quot;full place beside the anthem as a worthy object of artistic invention.&quot; Vaughan Williams ranked the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; as one of Stanford&#x27;s works of &quot;imperishable beauty&quot;. In Temperley&#x27;s view, Stanford&#x27;s services in A (1880), F (1889) and C (1909) are the most important and enduring additions from those years to the cathedral repertory. As with his concert works, Stanford&#x27;s music is dominated by melody. The bass line, in Rodmell&#x27;s view, is always important yet secondary and anything in between was regarded as &quot;filling&quot;.

=== Operas ===
In a 1981 survey of Stanford&#x27;s operas, the critic Nigel Burton writes that &quot;Shamus O&#x27;Brien&quot; lacks good tunes, and that the only memorable melody in it is not by Stanford but is an English folk song, &quot;The Glory of the West&quot;. Burton is more dismissive of &quot;The Critic&quot;, which he describes as &quot;a poor man&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;&quot;. Dibble rates &quot;The Critic&quot; much higher, considering it to be one of Stanford&#x27;s two best operas. In 1921, Porte wrote that it contains music that is &quot;remarkably fresh, melodious and thoroughly individual in character and outlook. The vocal and instrumental writing is done with consummate skill.&quot; Burton praises &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, judging it to contain some of Stanford&#x27;s best operatic music. He rates the last of the composer&#x27;s operas, &quot;The Travelling Companion&quot;, as his finest operatic achievement, though Burton credits much of its power to the brilliant story adapted by Henry Newbolt from Hans Andersen. Porte writes that the music is often solemn and romantic, and curiously impressive. Christopher Webber writes that it has &quot;an atmosphere not quite like any other: &quot;The Travelling Companion&quot; has timeless qualities ... [which] could go far to enhance Stanford&#x27;s reputation as an opera composer&quot;. A new production of &quot;The Critic&quot;, celebrating the centenary of Stanford&#x27;s death, was staged to critical acclaim at the Wexford Opera Festival in 2024.

== Recordings ==
Although much of Stanford&#x27;s music is neglected in the concert hall, a considerable amount has been recorded. Complete cycles of the symphonies have been issued by the Chandos and Naxos labels, under the conductors Vernon Handley and David Lloyd-Jones. Other orchestral works recorded for CD include the six &quot;Irish Rhapsodies&quot;, the Clarinet Concerto, the Second Piano Concerto and the Second Violin Concerto. Of the nine operas, only &quot;The Travelling Companion&quot; is available in a complete performance.

Stanford&#x27;s church music is well represented on disc. In his 2002 discography, Rodmell lists 14 versions of the Service in B, alongside multiple recordings of the Services in A, F and C, the &quot;Three Latin Motets&quot; Op. 38, and the composer&#x27;s setting of &quot;The Lord is my Shepherd&quot;. A 1926 disc of his Magnificat in G by Choir of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle was the first recording of a boy soprano soloist using an electrical microphone. His Mass in G Major received its world première recording in 2014, featuring the Choir of Exeter College Oxford and the Stapeldon Sinfonia, with Tim Muggeridge (organ) and directed by George de Voil: EMR CD021.

English mixed-voice choir the Cambridge Singers (conducted by John Rutter) released the album &quot;Stanford and Howells Remembered&quot; in 1992, including both sacred and secular works. It was remastered and re-released in 2020. The first CD dedicated to Stanford&#x27;s partsongs (including the Op. 119 set to poems by Mary Coleridge) appeared in 2013, sung by the Birmingham Conservatoire Chamber Choice, conductor Paul Spicer. He wrote around 60 partsongs in total.

Stanford also wrote some 200 art songs and around 300 folksongs intended for the concert hall. Songs recorded by several artists include &quot;La Belle Dame Sans Merci&quot;, performed by Janet Baker among others, &quot;An Irish Idyll&quot;, whose interpreters have included Kathleen Ferrier, and &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot; in recordings by such singers as Thomas Allen. Two more recent recordings dedicated to the songs have been issued: &quot;Love’s White Flame&quot;, with Elisabetta Paglia (mezzo-soprano) and Christopher Howell (piano) in 2020; and &quot;Songs of Faith, Love and Nonsense&quot;, with James Way (tenor), Roderick Williams (baritone) and Andrew West (piano) in 2021. The song cycle &quot;Cushendall&quot;, op.118 (1910), was recorded for the first time in 2024 by Sharon Carty and Finghin Collins.

Among the chamber works that have received several recordings are the Three Intermezzi for Clarinet and Piano and the Clarinet Sonata. All eight of the previously neglected string quartets have now been recorded, as have the two string quintets. The first significant recording of piano works included the Three Rhapsodies (alongside Parry&#x27;s &quot;Shulbrede Tunes&quot;) in 1978 by John Parry. Peter Jacobs recorded both sets of 24 Preludes, the &quot;Characteristic Pieces&quot; and the &quot;Dante Rhapsodies&quot; in the late 1990s. Christopher Howell has since recorded the complete piano music. 

== The Stanford Society ==
The Charles Villiers Stanford Society was founded in 2007 by a small group of music enthusiasts and academics including John Covell and Professor Jeremy Dibble, Stanford biographer. The society was formed to promote further interest and research into Stanford&#x27;s works and life, and to support and encourage performances and recordings of some less well-known works by the composer.

The society has supported a number of first performances and recordings of Stanford&#x27;s works. These include a world premiere recording of Stanford&#x27;s last opera &quot;The Travelling Companion&quot; Op.146, dating from 1916.

<doc id="214043" wikidata="Q231140" url="?curid=214043" title="Hiroshima Peace Memorial">
<text>The , originally the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, and now commonly called the Genbaku Dome, , is part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan, and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

The building is a prominent structure that remained standing in the area around the atomic bombing of Hiroshima at the end of World War II. The ruin of the hall serves as a memorial to the over 140,000 people who were killed in the bombing. It is permanently kept in a state of preserved ruin as a reminder of the destructive effects of nuclear warfare.

== Original building ==
The Product Exhibition Hall building was originally designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel. The design included a distinctive dome at the top of the building. It was completed in April 1915 and was named the &quot;Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition&quot; (HMI). It was formally opened to the public in August that year. In 1921, the name was changed to the &quot;Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall&quot;, and again, in 1933, to the &quot;Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall&quot; (広島県産業奨励館 Hiroshima-ken Sangyo Shourei-kan). The building was located in the large business district next to the Aioi Bridge and was primarily used for art and educational exhibitions.

== Atomic bombing ==
During the Second World War, at 8:15 a.m. on 6 August 1945, the first atomic bomb to be used in war was dropped on Hiroshima. The bomb possessed a force equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT, and effectively obliterated the city. Hiroshima was chosen as a target because it was an important port on southern Honshu and was headquarters of the Japanese Second General Army with 40,000 military personnel in the city, and was the only large city that was not known to have a POW camp. Intended for the Aioi Bridge, the bomb missed its target by and exploded directly over the Shima Hospital, which was very near to the Genbaku Dome. The center of the blast occurred horizontally and vertically from the Dome. Everyone inside the building was killed instantly.

Because the explosion was almost directly overhead, the building was able to retain its shape. The building&#x27;s vertical columns were able to resist the nearly vertical downward force of the blast, and parts of the concrete and brick outer walls remained intact. The building&#x27;s durability can also be attributed to its earthquake-resistant design; it has held up to earthquakes before and since the bombing.

== Preservation ==

Due to its stone and steel structure, the building was one of the few structures left standing near the bomb&#x27;s hypocenter. Soon commonly called the Genbaku (&quot;A-Bomb&quot;) Dome, due to the exposed metal dome framework at its apex, the structure was scheduled to be demolished with the rest of the ruins, but the majority of the building was intact, delaying the demolition plans. The Dome became a subject of controversy, with some locals wanting it torn down, while others wanted to preserve it as a memorial of the bombing and a symbol of peace. Ultimately, when the reconstruction of Hiroshima began, the skeletal remains of the building were preserved.

From 1950 through 1964, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was established around the Dome. The Hiroshima City Council adopted a resolution in 1966 on the permanent preservation of the Genbaku Dome, officially named the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome). The Dome continues to be the park&#x27;s primary landmark.

Weathering and deterioration of the Genbaku Dome continued in the post-war period. The Hiroshima City Council declared in 1966 that it intended to indefinitely preserve the structure, now termed &quot;Genbaku Dome&quot;. The first popularly elected mayor of Hiroshima, Shinzo Hamai (1905–1968) sought funds for the preservation effort domestically and internationally. During one trip to Tokyo, Hamai resorted to collecting funds directly on the streets of the capital. Preservation work on the Genbaku Dome was completed in 1967. The Genbaku Dome has undergone two minor preservation projects to stabilize the ruin, notably between October 1989 and March 1990.

The Genbaku Dome stands almost exactly as it did after the bombing on 6 August 1945. Changes to the ruins, meant to ensure the stability of the structure, have been minimal. A metal frame was installed inside to give the ruin more stability.

==As a political venue==

In international politics, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Memorial on 27 May 2016. As an act of reciprocity, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the USS Arizona Memorial, Honolulu the same year. The leaders of the 49th G7 summit visited the Memorial on 19 May 2023.

Domestically, the memorial is a common venue for anti-war, anti-nuclear weapons and anti-nuclear power movement in Japan protests. The municipal government of Hiroshima holds the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony at the Memorial.

== UNESCO World Heritage Site ==

In December 1996, the Genbaku Dome was registered on the UNESCO World Heritage List based on the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Its inclusion into the UNESCO list was based on its survival from a destructive force (atomic bomb), the first use of nuclear weapons on a human population, and its representation as a symbol of peace.

Delegates to the World Heritage Committee from China and the United States had reservations regarding the confirmation of the memorial as a World Heritage Site. China cited the possibility that the monument could be used to downplay the fact that the victim countries of Japan&#x27;s aggression suffered the greatest losses of life during the war, and the United States stated that having a memorial to a war site would omit the necessary historical context. The United States dissociated itself from the decision.

<text>Francesco Durante (31 March 1684 – 30 September 1755) was an Italian composer of the Neapolitan School. Best known for his church music, he was also an important teacher, instructing Niccolò Jommelli, Giovanni Paisiello, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Niccolò Piccinni and Leonardo Vinci, among others.

== Life and work ==
He was born at Frattamaggiore, in the Kingdom of Naples, and at an early age he entered the &quot;Conservatorio dei poveri di Gesù Cristo&quot;, in Naples, where he received lessons from Gaetano Greco. Later he became a pupil of Alessandro Scarlatti at the Conservatorio di Sant&#x27;Onofrio. He is also supposed to have studied under Bernardo Pasquini and Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni in Rome, but there is no documentary evidence. He is said to have succeeded Scarlatti in 1725 at &quot;Sant&#x27; Onofrio&quot;, and to have remained there until 1742, when he succeeded Porpora as head of the Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto, also in Naples. This post he held for thirteen years, till his death in Naples. He was married three times.

His fame as a teacher was considerable, and Niccolò Jommelli, Giovanni Paisiello, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Niccolò Piccinni and Leonardo Vinci were amongst his pupils. As a teacher, he insisted on the unreasoning observance of rules, differing thus from Scarlatti, who treated all his pupils as individuals.

A complete collection of Durante&#x27;s works, consisting almost exclusively of sacred music, was presented by Gaspare Selvaggi, a Neapolitan art collector and music theorist, to the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. A catalogue may be found in Fétis&#x27;s &quot;Biographie universelle&quot;. The imperial library of Vienna also preserves a valuable collection of Durante&#x27;s manuscripts. Two requiems, several masses (one of which, a most original work, is the Pastoral Mass for four voices) and the &quot;Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah&quot; are amongst his most important settings. His Magnificat setting achieved popularity partly because of its misattribution to Pergolesi.

The fact that Durante never composed for the stage brought him an exaggerated reputation as a composer of sacred music. Considered one of the best church composers of his style and period, he seems to have founded the sentimental school of Italian church music. Nevertheless, Hasse protested against Durante&#x27;s being described as the greatest harmonist of Italy, a title which he ascribed to Alessandro Scarlatti.

<doc id="214049" wikidata="Q272502" url="?curid=214049" title="Bagel">
<text>A bagel (; ; also spelled beigel) is a bread roll originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. Bagels are traditionally made from yeasted wheat dough that is shaped by hand into a torus or ring, briefly boiled in water, and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. 

Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust—traditional choices include poppy and sesame seeds—or with salt grains. Different dough types include whole-grain and rye. The basic roll-with-a-hole design, hundreds of years old, allows even cooking and baking of the dough; it also allows groups of bagels to be gathered on a string or dowel for handling, transportation, and retail display.

The earliest known mention of a boiled-then-baked ring-shaped bread can be found in a 13th-century Syrian cookbook, where they are referred to as . Bagel-like bread known as obwarzanek was common earlier in Poland as seen in royal family accounts from 1394. Bagels have been widely associated with Ashkenazi Jews since the 17th century; they were first mentioned in 1610 in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland. 

Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America and Poland, especially in cities with a large Jewish population. Bagels are also sold (fresh or frozen, often in many flavors) in supermarkets.

== History ==
Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot; about the first known mention of the Polish word derived from the Yiddish word in the &quot;Community Regulations&quot; of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the food was given as a gift to women in childbirth. There is some evidence that the bagel may have been derived from pretzels made in Germany brought by immigrants to Poland.

In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the became a staple of Polish cuisine. Its name derives from the Yiddish word from the German dialect word , meaning &#x27;ring&#x27; or &#x27;bracelet&#x27;.

Variants of the word are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a similar form of sweet-filled pastry; , a pastry filled with poppy seeds, and , a pastry filled with ground nuts. The term is also used in southern German dialects, where refers to a pile, e.g., (&#x27;woodpile&#x27;). According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, &quot;bagel&quot; derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish , which came from the Middle High German or &#x27;ring&#x27;, which itself came from (&#x27;ring&#x27;) in Old High German, similar to the Old English (&#x27;ring&#x27;) and (&#x27;to bend, bow&#x27;). Similarly, another etymology in the Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German , a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German , a stirrup or ring.

In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels (locally spelled &quot;beigels&quot;) have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.
Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338. They had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century with automation. Daniel Thompson started work on the first commercially viable bagel machine in 1958; bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, Murray Lender, and Florence Sender leased this technology and pioneered automated production and distribution of frozen bagels in the 1960s. Murray also invented pre-slicing the bagel.

Around 1900, the &quot;bagel brunch&quot; became popular in New York City. The bagel brunch consists of a bagel topped with lox, cream cheese, capers, tomato, and red onion. This and similar combinations of toppings have remained associated with bagels into the 21st century in the United States.

In Japan, the first kosher bagels were brought by from New York in 1989. BagelK created green tea, chocolate, maple-nut, and banana-nut flavors for the market in Japan. Some Japanese bagels, such as those sold by , are soft and sweet; others, such as Einstein Bros. bagels sold by Costco in Japan, are the same as in the U.S.

=== Size change over time ===
Bagels in the U.S. have increased in size over time. Starting at around , by 1915, the average bagel weighed ; the size began to increase further in the 1960s. By 2003, the average bagel sold on a Manhattan coffee cart weighed around .

== Preparation and preservation ==
At its most basic, traditional bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred to create the firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. With a dough hydration of around 50–57%, bagel dough is among the stiffest bread doughs. Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, or sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.

Bagels are traditionally made by:
* mixing and kneading the ingredients to form the dough
* shaping the dough into the traditional bagel shape, round with a hole in the middle, from a long thin piece of dough
* proofing the bagels for at least 12 hours at low temperature ()
* boiling each bagel for 60–90 seconds in water that may contain additives such as lye, baking soda, barley malt syrup, or honey
* baking at a temperature between 

This production method gives bagels their distinctive taste, chewy texture, and shiny appearance.

In recent years, a variant has emerged, producing what is sometimes called the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. The dough used is intentionally more alkaline to aid browning, because the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.

Bagels can be frozen for up to six months.

== Quality ==
According to a 2012 &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; article, the ideal bagel should have a slightly crispy crust, a distinct &quot;pull&quot; when a piece is separated from the whole by biting or pinching, a chewy inside, and the flavor of bread freshly baked. The taste may be complemented by additions cooked on the bagel, such as onion, garlic, sesame seeds, or poppy seeds. The appeal of a bagel may change upon being toasted. Toasting can have the effect of bringing or removing desirable chewiness, softening the crust, and moderating off-flavors.

Traditionally New Yorkers do not toast bagels; they argue that if a bagel is well made and fresh it should never be toasted. Some New York City bagel shops, like Murray&#x27;s in Chelsea and Ess-a-Bagel at 21st and Third Avenue, have had no-toasting policies. Toasting of bagels in New York City is considered a bastardization and sacrilege. Former &quot;New York Times&quot; food critic Mimi Sheraton called the practice of eating toasted bagels obscene.

A typical bagel has , 1.0–4.5 grams of fat, 330–660 milligrams of sodium, and 2–5 grams of fiber. Gluten-free bagels have much more fat, often 9 grams, because of ingredients in the dough to supplant the wheat flour of the original.

== Varieties ==
===New York style===
The New York bagel contains malt, is cold-fermented for several days to develop the flavors and enhance the crust, and is boiled in salted water before baking in a standard oven. The resulting bagel has a fluffy interior and a chewy crust. According to CNN, Brooklynites believe New York bagels are the best due to the quality of the local water. According to Brooklyn Water Bagels CEO Steven Fassberg, the characteristics of a New York bagel are the result of the recipe formula and preparation method.

===Montreal style===
Different from the New York style, the Montreal-style bagel contains malt and sugar with no salt; it is boiled in honey-sweetened water before baking in a wood-fired oven. It is predominantly of the sesame &quot;white&quot; seeds variety (bagels in Toronto are similar to those made in New York in that they are less sweet, generally are coated with poppy seeds and are baked in a standard oven).

=== St. Louis style ===
The St. Louis style bagel refers not to composition, but to a particular method of slicing the bagel. The St. Louis style bagels are sliced vertically multiple times, instead of the traditional single horizontal slice. The slices range from thick. This style of bagel was popularized by the St. Louis Bread Company, now known as Panera Bread. Generally, the bagels are sliced into eight pieces using a bread slicer, which produces characteristically precise cuts (the bagel is not torn or crushed while slicing). This particular method of preparation increases the surface area available for spreads (e.g., cream cheese, butter). However, it decreases the portability of the bagel and prevents formation of sandwiches.

===Other bagel styles===
Other bagel styles can be found elsewhere; Chicago-style bagels are baked with steam. American chef John Mitzewich has a recipe for what he calls San Francisco-style bagels which yields bagels flatter than New York-style bagels, characterized by a rough-textured crust. The traditional London bagel (or beigel as it is sometimes spelled) is chewier and has a denser texture.

In Austria, (often also spelled or in its diminutive form) are a traditional Lenten food. The rings are made from a yeasted dough, rolled out very thin and briefly boiled in salted water before topped with salt and caraway seeds and then baked. Depending on the region, they are sometimes baked to a very hard consistency, making them relatively brittle. Connected with it is the tradition of () at Easter where two people pull on opposite ends of a until it breaks into two pieces. Tearing off the larger piece is meant to bring good luck. In Vienna, Eastern Lower Austria and Burgenland, has taken on the meaning of certain types of kipferl.

== Non-traditional doughs and types ==

While normally and traditionally made of yeasted wheat, in the late 20th century variations on the bagel flourished. Non-traditional versions that change the dough recipe include pumpernickel, rye, sourdough, bran, whole wheat, and multigrain. Other variations change the flavor of the dough, often using blueberry, salt, onion, garlic, egg, cinnamon, raisin, chocolate chip, cheese, or some combination of the above. Green bagels are sometimes created for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

A flat bagel, known as a &#x27;flagel&#x27;, can be found in a few locations in and around New York City, Long Island, and Toronto. According to a review attributed to New York&#x27;s &quot;Village Voice&quot; food critic Robert Seitsema, the flagel was first created by Brooklyn&#x27;s &#x27;Tasty Bagels&#x27; deli in the early 1990s.

== Large scale commercial sales ==

=== United States supermarket sales ===

According to the American Institute of Baking (AIB), 2008 supermarket sales (52-week period ending January 27, 2009) of the top eight leading commercial fresh (not frozen) bagel brands in the United States:
* totaled to US$430,185,378 based on 142,669,901 package unit sales.
* the top eight leading brand names for the above were (by order of sales): Thomas&#x27;, Sara Lee, private label brands, Pepperidge Farm, Thomas Mini Squares, Lender&#x27;s Bagels (Pinnacle Foods), Weight Watchers and The Alternative Bagel (Western Bagel).

Further, AIB-provided statistics for the 52-week period ending May 18, 2008, for refrigerated/frozen supermarket bagel sales for the top 10 brand names totaled US$50,737,860, based on 36,719,977 unit package sales.

The AIB reported US$626.9 million fresh bagel US supermarket sales (excluding Wal-Mart) for the 52 weeks ending 11 April 2012. Fresh/frozen supermarket sales (excluding Wal-Mart) for the 52 weeks ending 13 May 2012 was US$592.7 million. The average price for a bag of fresh bagels was $3.27; for frozen it was $1.23.

== Similar breads ==

Many cultures developed similar breads and preparations, such as &quot;bubliki&quot; in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and &quot;obwarzanek&quot; (in particular &quot;obwarzanek krakowski&quot;) in Poland. Somewhat similar in appearance to bagels, these breads are usually topped with sesame and poppy seeds. The ingredients in these breads and bagels somewhat differ, as these breads are made with a different dough using butter, and sometimes also with milk.

In Italy, &quot;taralli&quot; and &quot;&quot; are breads similar to bagels.

In Turkey, a salty and fattier form is called &quot;açma&quot;. The ring-shaped simit is sometimes marketed today as a Turkish bagel. Archival sources show that the &quot;simit&quot; has been produced in Istanbul since 1525. Based on Üsküdar court records (Şer’iyye Sicili) dated 1593, the weight and price of simit was standardized for the first time. Noted 17th-century traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote that there were 70 simit bakeries in Istanbul during the 1630s.

Jean Brindesi&#x27;s early 19th-century oil paintings about Istanbul daily life show simit sellers on the streets. Warwick Goble made an illustration of the simit sellers of Istanbul in 1906. Simit is very similar to the twisted sesame-sprinkled bagels pictured being sold in early 20th century Poland. &quot;Simit&quot; are also sold on the street in baskets or carts, as bagels were then.

The Uyghurs of Xinjiang, China enjoy &quot;girdeh nan&quot; (from Persian, meaning round bread), a type of nan, the local bread.

Another bagel-like type of bread is the traditional German &quot;Dortmunder Salzkuchen&quot; from the 19th century.

Ka&#x27;ak al-Quds (better known in English as the Jerusalem bagel) is an oblong ring bread, usually topped with sesame seeds, with its origins in Jerusalem. Unlike the bagel, it is not boiled prior to baking.

== Cultural references ==
&quot;Bagel&quot; is also a Yeshivish term for sleeping 12 hours straight—e.g., &quot;I slept a bagel last night.&quot; There are various opinions as to the origins of this term. It may be a reference to the fact that bagel dough has to &quot;rest&quot; for at least 12 hours between mixing and baking or simply to the fact that the hour hand on a clock traces a bagel shape over the course of 12 hours.

In tennis, a &quot;bagel&quot; refers to a player winning a set 6–0; winning a match 6–0, 6–0, 6–0 is called a &quot;triple bagel&quot;.

&quot;&quot;Bublichki&quot; or &quot;&quot;Bagelach&quot; is a title of a famous Russian and Yiddish song written in Odesa in the 1920s. The Barry Sisters together with the Ziggy Elman Orchestra made it popular in the US in 1939. Today it belongs to the repertoire of klezmer, jazz and pop musicians.

The term &quot;bageling&quot; refers to when a Jew uses a Jewish word or phrase in a conversation, or in the vicinity of a stranger who is also clearly Jewish, in order to inform them that they are also Jewish.

The bagel is a major plot device in the 2022 science-fiction film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;.

<text>Blaenau Ffestiniog () is a town in Gwynedd, Wales. Once a slate mining centre in historic Merionethshire, it now relies much on tourists, drawn for instance to the Ffestiniog Railway and Llechwedd Slate Caverns. It reached a population of 12,000 at the peak development of the slate industry, but fell with the decline in demand for slate. The population of the community, including the nearby village Llan Ffestiniog, was 4,875 at the 2011 census: the fourth most populous in Gwynedd after Bangor, Caernarfon and Llandeiniolen. The population not including Llan is now only about 4,000.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The meaning of Blaenau Ffestiniog is &quot;uplands of Ffestiniog&quot;. The Welsh word &#x27; is the plural of &#x27; &quot;upland, remote region&quot;. Ffestiniog here is probably &quot;territory of Ffestin&quot; (Ffestin being a personal name) or could possibly mean &quot;defensive place&quot;. The English pronunciation of Blaenau Ffestiniog suggested by the &quot;BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names&quot; is , but the first word is pronounced in the area, reflecting features of the local Welsh dialect.

==History==

===Farming (before 1750)===
Before the slate industry grew, present-day Blaenau Ffestiniog was a farming region, with scattered farms working the uplands below the cliffs of Dolgaregddu and Nyth-y-Gigfran. A few of the historic farmhouses survive at Cwm Bowydd, Neuadd Ddu, Gelli, Pen y Bryn and Cefn Bychan. Much of the land was owned by large estates.

===Slate (1750–1850)===
Blaenau Ffestiniog town arose to support workers in the local slate mines. At its peak, it was the largest in Merioneth. In 1765, two men from the long-established Cilgwyn quarry near Nantlle began quarrying in Ceunant y Diphwys to the north-east of the present town. The valley had long been known for slate beds worked on a small scale. The original quarry has been wiped out by subsequent mining, but it was probably at or near Diphwys Casson Quarry. Led by Methusalem Jones, eight Cilgwyn partners took a lease on Gelli Farm for their quarry. In 1800, William Turner and William Casson from the Lake District bought the lease and expanded production. Turner also owned Dorothea quarry in the Nantlle Valley, adjacent to Cilgwyn.

In 1819, quarrying began on slopes at Allt-fawr near Rhiwbryfdir Farm, on land owned by the Oakeley family from Tan y Bwlch. Within a decade, three slate quarries were operating on Allt-fawr. These amalgamated to form Oakeley Quarry, which became the largest underground slate mine in the world.

Quarrying grew fast in the earlier 19th century. Notable quarries opened at Llechwedd, Maenofferen and Votty &amp; Bowydd, while Turner and Casson&#x27;s Diphwys Casson flourished. Further off, Cwmorthin and Wrysgan quarries were dug to the south of the town, while at the head of Cwm Penmachno to the north-east, a series of quarries started at Rhiwbach, Cwt y Bugail and Blaen y Cwm. To the south-east another cluster worked the slopes of Manod Mawr. The workforce for these was drawn initially from nearby towns and villages such as Ffestiniog and Maentwrog. Before the arrival of railways, travel to the quarries was difficult and workers&#x27; houses were built nearby. These typically grew up round existing farms and roads between them. An early settlement was at Rhiwbryfdir, for the Oakeley and Llechwedd quarries. As early as 1801, new roads were built specifically for the quarries. By 1851, there were 3,460 people living in the new town of Blaenau Ffestiniog.

===Urbanisation (1851–1900)===

During the 1860s and 1870s the boom in the slate industry fed the nascent town of Blaenau Ffestiniog. It gained its first church and first school and saw much ribbon development along its roads. The Old Market Hall, which also served as the town hall, was completed in 1864. By 1881, its population had reached 11,274. The slate boom gave way to a sharp decline. The 1890s saw several quarries lose money for the first time, and several fail entirely, including Cwmorthin and Nyth-y-Gigfran.

Blaenau Ffestiniog hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1898.

===Slate decline (1901–1950)===
The slate industry recovered only partly from the recession of the 1890s. The First World War sent many quarrymen into the armed forces and production fell. There was a short post-war boom, but the long-term trend was towards mass-produced tiles and cheaper slate sourced from Spain. Oakeley Quarry took over Cwmorthin, Votty &amp; Bowydd and Diphwys Casson, while Llechwedd acquired Maenofferen. Despite this consolidation, the decline continued. The Second World War brought a further loss of workforce. In 1946, the Ffestiniog Railway closed.

===Since 1945===
In August 1945 the secluded farmhouse of Bwlch Ocyn at Manod, belonging to Clough Williams-Ellis, became the home for three years of the writer Arthur Koestler and his wife Mamaine. While there, Koestler became a close friend of his fellow writer George Orwell.

The remaining quarries served by the Rhiwbach Tramway closed in the 1950s and 1960s. Oakeley closed in 1970, with the loss of many local jobs. It re-opened in 1974 on a much smaller scale and was reworked until 2010. Maenofferen and Llechwedd continued, but Maenofferen finally closed in 1998. Llechwedd is still a working quarry, working the David Jones part of Maenofferen (level two-and-a-half).

As the slate industry shrank, so did the population of Blaenau Ffestiniog, which fell to 4,875 in 2011. Tourism became the town&#x27;s largest employer, with the development of Gloddfa Ganol in the Oakeley quarry and the Slate Caverns at Llechwedd quarry. The revived Ffestiniog Railway and Llechwedd remain popular attractions, as does the Antur Stiniog downhill mountain-biking centre, and more recently the Zip World Titan zip-line site, which includes the Bounce Below slate-mine activity centre.

==Geography==

Some local villages, notably Tanygrisiau and Manod, are sometimes taken to be parts of Blaenau Ffestiniog.

Although the town is in the centre of the Snowdonia National Park, the boundaries exclude it and its substantial slate-waste heaps. There were proposals in 2010 for the town to become part of the national park.

Blaenau Ffestiniog has one of the highest rainfalls in Wales. It has several reservoirs, one of which supplies the Ffestiniog Hydro Power Station. Stwlan Dam lies between two of the mountains in the area, Moelwyn Bach and Moelwyn Mawr. The mountains round the town form a watershed between the River Lledr flowing north as a tributary of the River Conwy and the River Dwyryd flowing west.

==Education==

Ysgol y Moelwyn is the main secondary school, covering Blaenau, Manod, Tanygrisiau, Llan Ffestiniog, Trawsfynydd, Gellilydan, Maentwrog and stretching into the Vale of Ffestiniog and Dolwyddelan. It had 309 pupils in 2016. Some pupils travel to neighbouring towns.

There are five primary schools in the area.

==Welsh language==
Most Blaenau Ffestiniog people habitually speak Welsh. At the 2011 census, 78.6 per cent over the age of three said they could speak it, as against 80.9 per cent at the 2001 census. The latest inspection reports of the town&#x27;s primary schools, Ysgol Maenofferen and Ysgol Y Manod, both in 2016, put the proportion of pupils speaking Welsh at home at 87 and 85 per cent. At the town&#x27;s secondary school, Ysgol y Moelwyn, 82 per cent of pupils came from Welsh-speaking homes in 2014, making its Welsh-speaking intake the highest among secondary schools in the former county of Meirionnydd and fourth highest among those in Gwynedd.

==Transport==

The main access to Blaenau Ffestiniog is the A470 road north to Llandudno and south to Dolgellau and beyond. The A496 runs south to the coastal resorts of Harlech and Barmouth and connects with the A487 towards Porthmadog and the Llŷn Peninsula. Just north of the town, the A470 climbs steeply to the Crimea Pass and meets the A5 at Betws-y-Coed, giving access to Llangollen, Wrexham and Shrewsbury in the east and Bangor and Holyhead in the west.

Town bus services are mainly provided by Arriva Buses Wales and Llew Jones, with routes to Porthmadog, Dolgellau and to Llandudno via Betws-y-Coed and Llanrwst. Town circular services via Tanygrisiau are operated hourly on weekdays by John&#x27;s Coaches.

Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station, on the site of the former Great Western station, is used by the Ffestiniog Railway and the Conwy Valley Line, their previous stations being no longer in use. The Conwy Valley line runs to the North Wales coast at Llandudno Junction, with links to Chester, Holyhead and Manchester.

At various times the town has been the terminus for four independent railway lines, each with its own station or stations:
*The Ffestiniog Railway
*The Festiniog &amp; Blaenau Railway
*The Conwy Valley line of the London &amp; North Western Railway
*The Bala Ffestiniog Line of the Great Western Railway

==Tourism==
Blaenau Ffestiniog&#x27;s tourist attractions include the Ffestiniog Railway and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns, a former slate mine open to visitors. Llechwedd is often placed among Wales&#x27;s top five visitor attractions. Near Blaenau Ffestiniog there are miles of mountain landscape with derelict quarries, rivers, various lakes and walking routes.

Several mountain biking trails have been created, some suitable for competitions. Bikes are available for hire.

==Regeneration/Rebranding==

The town centre has recently been regenerated, as funding from organisations, grants and the Welsh Government of £4.5 million are spent. A new bus station has been built along with new viewing areas for neighbouring mountain ranges. Several slate structures have been built with poetry engraved on them. These are about 40 ft tall and intended to respond visually to the slate hills and mountains. Poetry and local sayings have also been engraved on slate bands set in pavements in the town centre.

Various walkways have been installed, and a series of downhill mountain biking trails by Antur Stiniog. A kilometre-long zip-wire has been erected at Llechwedd Slate Caverns, which is popular with thrill-seekers.

If plans go ahead, Blaenau Ffestiniog will have the UK&#x27;s first vélo-rail, which is popular in France.

==Arts==
Many artists come to Blaenau Ffestiniog for the landscape around it, perhaps inspired by the harshness of the slate tips. They include Kyffin Williams and David Nash.

During the Second World War, the National Gallery stored art treasures in one of the mines in the town, to protect them from damage or destruction. The large steel gates are still standing preserving the paintings that remain in the caverns.

===Music===
Blaenau Ffestiniog has a strong musical tradition from quarrying days, ranging from the Caban, male voice choirs and brass bands, to Jazz/Dance bands like &quot;The New Majestics&quot;, popular rock bands of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Llwybr Llaethog and Anweledig, and more recent bands such as Gai Toms, Frizbee and Gwibdaith Hen Frân. The local alternative-music training school Gwallgofiaid has over a dozen bands at its centre at the Old Police Station in Park Square, served by five rehearsal rooms, a 24-track studio and Cwrt performance space.

<text>Johann Adolph Hasse (baptised 25 March 1699 – 16 December 1783) was an 18th-century German composer, singer and teacher of music. Immensely popular in his time, Hasse was best known for his prolific operatic output, though he also composed a considerable quantity of sacred music. Married to soprano Faustina Bordoni and a friend of librettist Pietro Metastasio, whose libretti he frequently set, Hasse was a pivotal figure in the development of &quot;opera seria&quot; and 18th-century music.

==Early career==
Hasse was baptised in Bergedorf near Hamburg where his family had been church organists for three generations. His career began in singing when he joined the Hamburg Oper am Gänsemarkt in 1718 as a tenor. In 1719 he obtained a singing post at the court of Brunswick, where in 1721 his first opera, &quot;Antioco&quot;, was performed; Hasse himself sang in the production.

He is thought to have left Germany during 1722. During the 1720s he lived mostly in Naples, dwelling there for six or seven years. In 1725 his serenata &quot;Antonio e Cleopatra&quot;, was performed at Naples; the principal roles were sung by Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli, and Vittoria Tesi. The success of this work not only earned Hasse many commissions from Naples&#x27;s opera houses, but also, according to Johann Joachim Quantz, brought him into contact with Alessandro Scarlatti, who became his teacher and friend; Hasse also altered his style in several respects to reflect that of Scarlatti.

Hasse&#x27;s popularity in Naples increased dramatically and for several years his workload kept him extremely busy. In this period he composed his only full &quot;opera buffa&quot;, &quot;La sorella amante&quot;, in addition to several &quot;intermezzi&quot; and serenatas. He visited the Venetian Carnival of 1730, where his opera &quot;Artaserse&quot; was performed at S Giovanni Grisostomo. Metastasio&#x27;s libretto was heavily reworked for the occasion, and Farinelli took a leading role. Two of his arias from this opera he later performed every night for a decade for Philip V of Spain.

==Dresden and Venice==
In 1730 Hasse married Faustina Bordoni, and was also appointed &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at the Dresden court, though he did not arrive at Dresden until July 1731; earlier in the year he had been active at Vienna, supervising a performance of his oratorio &quot;Daniello&quot; at the court of the Habsburgs. Soon after the couple&#x27;s arrival in Dresden, Faustina performed before the court. In September Hasse&#x27;s &quot;Cleofide&quot; (set to a highly adapted Metastasio text) was given its premiere; it seems possible that J. S. Bach attended the performance; certainly C. P. E. Bach claimed that Hasse and his father had become good friends around this time. King Augustus II the Strong of Poland and Saxony granted him the title of the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Kapellmeister.

In October Hasse left Dresden to direct premieres of his next operas at Turin and Rome, and he also wrote music for the Venetian theatres at this time. By late 1732, Hasse was in Naples again, though he spent the winter at Venice where his &quot;Siroe&quot; was first performed in particularly lavish style. In February 1733 Augustus II the Strong, Hasse&#x27;s early royal patron at Dresden, died. As the court went into a year of mourning, Hasse was permitted to remain abroad. Many of his sacred works, composed for Venice&#x27;s churches, date to this time.

For much of 1734 Hasse was at Dresden, but from 1735 until 1737 he was in Italy, largely at Naples. Faustina performed in the September 1735 premiere of &quot;Tito Vespasiano&quot; (another adapted Metastasio libretto) at Pesaro. Returning to the royal court in Dresden during 1737 Hasse composed five new operas, but when the court moved to Poland in the autumn of 1738 he and Faustina came back to Venice, where both of them were extremely popular. His next stay in Dresden was also his longest, between the first months of 1740 and January 1744. In this time he revised &quot;Artaserse&quot;, composing new arias for Faustina, and also wrote a couple of original &quot;intermezzi&quot;. His general avoidance of comic opera seems to have been due to Faustina, who feared that the style of singing demanded by &quot;opera buffa&quot; would damage her voice.

==Dresden: 1744–1763==

Between the winter of 1744 and late summer 1745, Hasse was in Italy, but then returned to Dresden for a year. Frederick the Great, a keen flute player, visited the court in December 1745, and it is likely that many of Hasse&#x27;s flute sonatas and concertos that date to this time were written for Frederick. The King of Prussia was also present at a performance of one of Hasse&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;s, and himself ordered a performance of the composer&#x27;s opera &quot;Arminio&quot;. Soon after Hasse visited Venice and Munich, returning to Dresden in June 1747 to stage his opera &quot;La spartana generosa&quot;, performed to celebrate multiple royal weddings at this time. Also at this time the hierarchy at Dresden was restructured; Nicola Porpora was named &quot;Kapellmeister,&quot; while Hasse himself was promoted to &quot;Oberkapellmeister.&quot;

In 1748 Hasse performed two of his operas, &quot;Ezio&quot; and &quot;Artaserse,&quot; in Bayreuth in the half finished Markgräfliches Opernhaus, because of the marriage of Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, the daughter of Wilhelmine of Bayreuth. The marriage of princess Maria Josepha of Saxony to the French Dauphin gave Hasse the opportunity to journey to Paris in the summer of 1750, where his &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot; was performed.

On 28 March 1750 Hasse presented his last oratorio &quot;La conversione di Sant&#x27; Agostino&quot; in the chapel of the royal palace in Dresden. The libretto, penned by the Dresden Electress Maria Antonia Walpurgis (1724–1780), concerns the conversion of a sinner to sainthood and was modeled after and edited by Metastasio. The Dresden premiere was followed by numerous performances of the work in Leipzig, Hamburg, Mannheim, Padua, Rome, Riga, Prague, Potsdam and Berlin which is a testament to the work&#x27;s popularity in the latter half of the 18th century.

The 1751 Carnival in Dresden saw the retirement of Faustina from operatic performance. Hasse continued to produce new operas throughout the decade, including a setting of Metastasio&#x27;s &quot;Il re pastore&quot;, a text later used by Mozart. In 1756 the Seven Years&#x27; War compelled the court at Dresden to move to Warsaw, though Hasse himself lived mostly in Italy, travelling to Poland solely to supervise productions of his operas, if at all. In the autumn of 1760 he moved to Vienna, where he stayed for the next two years, returning to Dresden in 1763 to find much of his home destroyed and the musical apparatus of the court opera wrecked. Hasse&#x27;s main patron at Dresden, king Augustus III of Poland and Saxony died soon after and his successor, who also died quickly, deemed elaborate musical events at the court superfluous. Hasse and Faustina were paid two years&#x27; salary but given no pension.

==Vienna and Venice: last years==
In 1764 Hasse travelled to Vienna, where the coronation of Joseph II was marked by a performance of his &quot;festa teatrale&quot; &quot;Egeria&quot;, again set to a libretto by Metastasio. For the most part, he remained at Vienna until 1773. Mozart was present at a performance of his &quot;Partenope&quot; in September 1767. Most of his operas composed during this period were also successfully produced at Naples. He was the favourite of Maria Theresa, and it can be argued that he took up the job of &quot;de facto&quot; court &quot;Kapellmeister.&quot; With the premiere of &quot;Piramo e Tisbe&quot; (September 1768) Hasse had intended to retire from opera but was compelled by Maria Theresa to compose a further work, &quot;Ruggiero&quot; (1771), again set to a Metastasian libretto. In 1771, when hearing 15-year-old Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Ascanio in Alba&quot;, Hasse is reported to have made the prophetic remark: &quot;This boy will cause us all to be forgotten.&quot;

At this time operatic style was undergoing significant change, and the model of &quot;opera seria&quot; that Hasse and Metastasio had settled found itself assailed by the threat of the reforms of Christoph Willibald Gluck and Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi, as laid down in the music and libretto for Gluck&#x27;s opera &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. Charles Burney, visiting Vienna in 1773, reported on the debate.
Finding his music under siege from an &quot;avant-garde&quot; surge in a new direction, Hasse left Vienna in 1773 and spent the final ten years of his life in Venice, teaching and composing sacred works. Faustina died in November 1781, and Hasse himself, after a long period of suffering from arthritis, just over two years later. He was almost completely ignored after his death, until F. S. Kandler paid for his gravestone in Venice, where he is buried in San Marcuola, and authored a biography of Hasse in 1820.

==Relationship with Metastasio==
Hasse&#x27;s friendship with Metastasio, and his appreciation of the art form the librettist had created, increased over the years. The early Metastasio texts he set were all greatly altered for the purpose, but Frederick the Great and Francesco Algarotti both exerted influence in order to make Hasse pay greater respect to Metastasio&#x27;s works. In the early 1740s he began setting new Metastasian libretti unadapted, and his personal relations with the librettist also improved significantly at around this time. In one of his letters, dated to March 1744, Metastasio made the following comments:
In the following years Hasse reset his earlier works based on Metastasio&#x27;s texts, this time paying great attention to the poet&#x27;s original intention, and during the 1760s, as Metastasio wrote new texts, Hasse was, as a general rule, the first composer to set them. Burney left the following note: 

==Style and reputation==
Despite Giovanni Battista Mancini&#x27;s claim that Hasse was the &quot;padre della musica&quot;, and despite the composer&#x27;s massive popularity as a figure at the very forefront of 18th-century serious Italian opera, after his death Hasse&#x27;s reputation vastly declined and his music lay mostly unperformed (with the exception of some of his sacred works, which were revived now and again in Germany). In particular, his operas sank without trace and revival only began as the 20th century approached its end: Gluck&#x27;s reforms took opera away from Hasse&#x27;s style and Metastasio&#x27;s Arcadian ideals to a new direction from which it would not return.

In his day, Hasse&#x27;s style was noted primarily for his lyricism and sense of melody. Burney put it this way:
Careful choice of key was also a crucial factor in Hasse&#x27;s style, with certain emotions usually marked out by certain key choices. Amorous feelings were expressed by A, for instance, while for expressions of aristocratic nobility Hasse used C and B flat; on the other hand, his supernatural and fear-inducing music usually went into the keys of C and F minor. Most of his arias begin in the major, switching only to minor for the B section before returning to major for the &quot;da capo&quot;. As his career developed his arias grew much longer but a lyrical sense was still his overriding target.

In Hamburg, the Johann Adolph Hasse Museum is dedicated to his life and work.

<text>Pyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin (; – ) was a Russian statesman who served as the third prime minister and the interior minister of the Russian Empire from 1906 until his assassination in 1911. Known as the greatest reformer of Russian society and economy, he initiated reforms that caused unprecedented growth of the Russian state, which was halted by his assassination.

Born in Dresden, in the Kingdom of Saxony, to a prominent Russian aristocratic family, Stolypin became involved in government from his early 20s. His successes in public service led to rapid promotions, culminating in his appointment as interior minister under prime minister Ivan Goremykin in April 1906. In July, Goremykin resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Stolypin.

As prime minister, Stolypin initiated major agrarian reforms, known as the Stolypin reform, that granted the right of private land ownership to the peasantry. His tenure was also marked by increased revolutionary unrest, to which he responded with a new system of martial law that allowed for the arrest, speedy trial, and execution of accused offenders. After numerous assassination attempts, Stolypin was fatally shot in September 1911 by revolutionary Dmitrii Bogrov in Kiev.

Stolypin was a monarchist and hoped to strengthen the throne by modernizing the rural Russian economy. Modernity and efficiency, rather than democracy, were his goals. He argued that the land question could be resolved and revolution averted only when the peasant commune was abolished and a stable landowning class of peasants, the kulaks, had a stake in the &quot;status quo&quot;. His successes and failures have been the subject of controversy among scholars, who agree that he was one of the last major statesmen of Imperial Russia with cogent and forceful public reform policies.

==Early life and career==

Stolypin was born at Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony, on 14 April 1862, and was baptized on 24 May in the Russian Orthodox Church in that city. His father, Arkady Dmitrievich Stolypin (1821–99), was a Russian envoy at the time.

Stolypin&#x27;s family was prominent in the Russian aristocracy, his forebears having served the tsars since the 16th century, and as a reward for their service had accumulated huge estates in several provinces. His father was a general in the Russian artillery, the governor of Eastern Rumelia and commandant of the Kremlin Palace guard. He was married twice. His second wife, Natalia Mikhailovna Stolypina (&quot;née&quot; Gorchakova; 1827–89), was the daughter of Prince Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov, the Commanding general of the Russian infantry during the Crimean War and later the viceroy of Congress Poland.

Pyotr grew up on the family estate &quot;Serednikovo&quot; () in Solnechnogorsky District, once inhabited by Mikhail Lermontov, near Moscow Governorate. In 1879 the family moved to Oryol. Stolypin and his brother Aleksandr studied at the Oryol Boys College where he was described by his teacher, B. Fedorova, as &#x27;standing out among his peers for his rationalism and character.&#x27;
In 1881 Stolypin studied agriculture at St. Petersburg University where one of his teachers was Dmitri Mendeleev. He entered government service upon graduating in 1885, writing his thesis on tobacco growing in the south of Russia. It is unclear if he joined the Ministry of State Property or Internal Affairs.

In 1884, Stolypin married Olga Borisovna von Neidhart whose family was of a similar standing to Stolypin&#x27;s. They married whilst Stolypin was still a student, an uncommon occurrence at the time. The marriage began in tragic circumstances: Olga had been engaged to Stolypin&#x27;s brother, Mikhail, who died in a duel. The marriage was a happy one, devoid of scandal. The couple had five daughters and one son.

===Lithuania===
Stolypin spent much of his life and career in Lithuania, then administratively known as Northwestern Krai of the Russian Empire.

 From 1869, Stolypin spent his childhood years in Kalnaberžė manor (now Kėdainiai district of Lithuania), built by his father, a place that remained his favorite residence for the rest of life. In 1876, the Stolypin family moved to Vilna (now Vilnius), where he attended grammar school.

Stolypin served as marshal of the Kovno Governorate (now Kaunas, Lithuania) between 1889 and 1902. This public service gave him an inside view of local needs and allowed him to develop administrative skills. His thinking was influenced by the single-family farmstead system of the Northwestern Krai, and he later sought to introduce the land reform based on private ownership throughout the Russian Empire.

Stolypin&#x27;s service in Kovno was deemed a success by the Russian government. He was promoted seven times, culminating in his promotion to the rank of state councilor in 1901. Four of his daughters were also born during this period; his daughter Maria recalled: &quot;this was the most calm period [of] his life&quot;.

In May 1902 Stolypin was appointed governor in Grodno Governorate, where he was the youngest person ever appointed to this position.

==Governor of Saratov==
In February 1903, he became governor of Saratov. Stolypin is known for suppressing strikers and peasant unrest in January 1905. According to Orlando Figes, its peasants were among the poorest and most rebellious in the whole of the country. It seems he cooperated with the zemstvos, the local government. He gained a reputation as the only governor able to keep a firm hold on his province during the Revolution of 1905, a period of widespread revolt. The roots of unrest lay partly in the Emancipation Reform of 1861, which had given land to the Obshchina, instead of individually to the newly freed serfs. Stolypin was the first governor to use effective police methods. Some sources suggest that he had a police record on every adult male in his province.

==Interior minister and prime minister==

Stolypin&#x27;s successes as provincial governor led to his appointment as interior minister under Ivan Goremykin in April 1906. He advocated for a new track of the Trans-Siberian Railway along the Russian side of the Amur river.

The absent-minded Goremykin had been described by his predecessor Sergei Witte as a bureaucratic nonentity. After two months, Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov suggested Goremykin step down and conducted secret negotiations with Pavel Milyukov, who proposed a cabinet of only Kadets, which Trepov believed would fall afoul of Tsar Nicholas II. Trepov opposed Stolypin, who promoted a coalition cabinet. Georgy Lvov and Alexander Guchkov tried to convince the Tsar to accept liberals in the new government.

When Goremykin resigned on , Nicholas II appointed Stolypin as Prime Minister, while remaining as Minister of the Interior. He dissolved the Duma, despite the reluctance of some of its more radical members, to clear the field for cooperation with the new government. In response, 120 Kadet and 80 Trudovik and Social Democrat deputies went to Vyborg (then under the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, beyond the reach of Russian police) and responded with the Vyborg Manifesto (or the &quot;Vyborg Appeal&quot;), written by Pavel Milyukov. Stolypin allowed the signers to return to the capital unmolested.


On 25 August 1906, three assassins from the Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists, wearing military uniforms, bombed a public reception Stolypin was holding at his dacha on Aptekarsky Island. Stolypin was only slightly injured by flying splinters, but 28 others were killed. Stolypin&#x27;s 15-year-old daughter lost both legs and later succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, and his 3-year-old son Arkady broke a leg, as the two stood on a balcony. Stolypin moved into the Winter Palace. In October 1906, at the request of the tsar, Grigori Rasputin paid a visit to the wounded child. On 9 November an imperial decree made far-reaching changes in land tenure law, disrupting in one sweep the communal and the household (family) property systems.

Stolypin changed the rules of the First Duma to attempt to make it more amenable to government proposals. On 8 June 1907, Stolypin dissolved the Second Duma, and 15 Kadets who had associated with terrorists were arrested; he also changed the weight of votes in favor of the nobility and wealthy, reducing the value of lower-class votes. The leading Kadets were ineligible. This affected the elections to the Third Duma, which returned much more conservative members eager to cooperate with the government. This changed Georgy Lvov from a moderate liberal into a radical.

As governor in Saratov, Stolypin had become convinced that the open field system had to be abolished; communal land tenure had to go. The chief obstacle appeared to be the Mir (commune), so its dissolution and the individualization of peasant land ownership became the leading objectives of his agrarian policy. He introduced Denmark-style land reforms to allay peasant grievances and soothe dissent. Stolypin proposed his own landlord-sided reform in opposition to the previous democratic proposals which led to the dissolution of the first two Russian parliaments. Stolypin&#x27;s reforms aimed to stem peasant unrest by creating a class of market-oriented smallholders who would support the social order. He was assisted by Alexander Krivoshein, who in 1908 became Minister of Agriculture. In June 1908 Stolypin lived in a wing of the Yelagin Palace where the Council of Ministers convened.

Supported by the Peasants&#x27; Land Bank, credit cooperatives proliferated from 1908, and Russian industry was booming. Stolypin tried to improve the lives of urban laborers and worked towards increasing the power of local governments, but the zemstvos adopted an attitude hostile to the government.

Leo Tolstoy was particularly indignant, writing to Stolypin: &quot;Stop your horrible activity! Enough of looking up to Europe, it is high time Russia knew its own mind!&quot; Tolstoy had argued similarly to Dostoyevsky, who was in favor of private ownership of land and wrote: &quot;If you want to transform humanity for the better, to turn almost beasts into humans, give them land and you will reach your goal.&quot;

In his handling of the “Jewish Question”, Stolypin set a fine example for his fellow statesmen, petitioning the Tsar to dissolve the Pale of Settlement, visiting synagogues and inviting Jewish musicians to his home to play for his family. 

In 1910, Stolypin&#x27;s brother-in-law Sergey Sazonov became Minister of Foreign Affairs, replacing Count Alexander Izvolsky. Around 1910 the press started a campaign against Rasputin, accusing him of improper sexual relations. Stolypin wanted to ban Rasputin from the capital and threatened to prosecute him as a sectarian. Rasputin decamped to Jerusalem, returning to St. Petersburg only after Stolypin&#x27;s death.

On 14 June 1910, Stolypin&#x27;s land reforms came before the Duma as a formal law, including a proposal to spread the zemstvo system to the southwestern provinces of Asian Russia. Though the law seemed likely to pass, Stolypin&#x27;s political opponents narrowly defeated it. In March 1911 Stolypin resigned from the fractious and chaotic Duma after the failure of his land-reform bill. Tsar Nicholas II decided to look for a successor to Stolypin and considered Sergei Witte, Vladimir Kokovtsov and Alexei Khvostov. The Moscow Times has summarized his career:

==Assassination==


Stolypin traveled to Kiev despite police warnings of an assassination plot, as there had already been 10 attempts to kill him. On , Stolypin attended a performance of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; at the Kiev Opera in the presence of the tsar and his eldest daughters, grand duchesses Olga and Tatiana. The theater was guarded by 90 men inside the building. According to Alexander Spiridovich, after the second act &quot;Stolypin was standing in front of the ramp separating the parterre from the orchestra, his back to the stage. On his right were Baron Freedericksz and Gen. Sukhomlinov.&quot; His personal bodyguard had stepped out to smoke. Stolypin was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the chest, by Dmitry Bogrov, a Jewish leftist revolutionary. Bogrov ran to one of the entrances and was caught. Stolypin rose from his chair, removed his gloves and unbuttoned his jacket, exposing a blood-soaked waistcoat. He gave a gesture to tell the tsar to go back and made the sign of the cross. He remained conscious, but his condition deteriorated. He died four days later.

Bogrov was hanged 10 days after the assassination. The judicial investigation was halted by order of the tsar, giving rise to suggestions that the assassination was planned not by leftists, but by conservative monarchists opposed to Stolypin&#x27;s reforms and his influence on the tsar. However, this has never been proven. On his request, Stolypin was buried in the city where he was murdered.

==Legacy==


Since 1905 Russia had been plagued by widespread political dissatisfaction and revolutionary unrest. With broad support, leftist organizations waged a violent campaign against the autocracy; throughout Russia, many police officials and bureaucrats were assassinated. &quot;Stolypin inspected rebellious areas unarmed and without bodyguards. During one of these trips, somebody dropped a bomb under his feet. There were casualties, but Stolypin survived.&quot; To respond to these attacks, Stolypin introduced a new court system of martial law, that allowed for the arrest and speedy trial of accused offenders. Over 3,000 (possibly 5,500) suspects were convicted and executed by these special courts between 1906 and 1909. In a Duma session on 17 November 1907, Kadet party member referred to the gallows as &quot;Stolypin&#x27;s efficient black Monday necktie&quot;. Outraged, Stolypin challenged Rodichev to a duel, but Rodichev apologized to avert it. Nevertheless, the expression became popular. The capacious railroad cars used for Siberian resettlement were named Stolypin cars.

There remains doubt whether, even without the disruption of Stolypin&#x27;s murder and the First World War, his agricultural policy could have succeeded. The deep conservatism from the mass of peasants made them slow to respond. In 1914 the strip system was still widespread, with only around 10% of the land having been consolidated into farms. Most peasants were unwilling to leave the security of the commune for the uncertainty of individual farming. Furthermore, by 1913, the government&#x27;s own Ministry of Agriculture had itself begun to lose confidence in the policy. Nevertheless, Krivoshein became the most powerful figure in the Imperial government.

Lenin in the Paris newspaper said, &quot;Social-Democrat&quot; on 31 October 1911, wrote &quot;Stolypin and the Revolution&quot;, calling for the &quot;mortification of the uber-lyncher&quot;, saying:
″Stolypin tried to pour new wine into old bottles, to reshape the old autocracy into a bourgeois monarchy; and the failure of Stolypin&#x27;s policy is the failure of tsarism on this last, the last conceivable, road for tsarism.&quot;

In &quot;Name of Russia&quot;, a 2008 television poll to select &quot;the greatest Russian&quot;, Stolypin placed second, behind Alexander Nevsky and followed by Joseph Stalin. He is seen by his admirers as the greatest statesman Russia ever had, the one who could have saved the country from revolution and the civil war.

On 27 December 2012, a monument to Pyotr Stolypin was unveiled in Moscow to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth. The monument is situated near the Russian White House, seat of the Russian Cabinet. At the foot of the pedestal, a bronze plaque quotes Stolypin: &quot;We must all unite in defense of Russia, coordinate our efforts, our duties and our rights in order to maintain one of Russia&#x27;s historic supreme rights – to be strong.&quot;

==Screen portrayals==

Stolypin is portrayed by Eric Porter in the opening scenes of the 1971 British film &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, fictitiously taking part in the Romanov dynasty tercentenary celebrations of 1913 before being assassinated later in the film, two years after his actual assassination.

Stolypin is portrayed by Frank Middlemass in episode 9 of the 1974 British miniseries &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;, &quot;Dress Rehearsal.&quot;

<text>In biology and medicine, a host is a larger organism that harbours a smaller organism; whether a parasitic, a mutualistic, or a commensalist &quot;guest&quot; (symbiont). The guest is typically provided with nourishment and shelter. Examples include animals playing host to parasitic worms (e.g. nematodes), cells harbouring pathogenic (disease-causing) viruses, or a bean plant hosting mutualistic (helpful) nitrogen-fixing bacteria. More specifically in botany, a host plant supplies food resources to micropredators, which have an evolutionarily stable relationship with their hosts similar to ectoparasitism. The host range is the collection of hosts that an organism can use as a partner.

==Symbiosis==
Symbiosis spans a wide variety of possible relationships between organisms, differing in their permanence and their effects on the two parties. If one of the partners in an association is much larger than the other, it is generally known as the host. In parasitism, the parasite benefits at the host&#x27;s expense. In commensalism, the two live together without harming each other, while in mutualism, both parties benefit.

Most parasites are only parasitic for part of their life cycle. By comparing parasites with their closest free-living relatives, parasitism has been shown to have evolved on at least 233 separate occasions. Some organisms live in close association with a host and only become parasitic when environmental conditions deteriorate.

A parasite may have a long-term relationship with its host, as is the case with all endoparasites. The guest seeks out the host and obtains food or another service from it, but does not usually kill it. In contrast, a parasitoid spends a large part of its life within or on a single host, ultimately causing the host&#x27;s death, with some of the strategies involved verging on predation. Generally, the host is kept alive until the parasitoid is fully grown and ready to pass on to its next life stage. A guest&#x27;s relationship with its host may be intermittent or temporary, perhaps associated with multiple hosts, making the relationship equivalent to the herbivory of a wild-living animal. Another possibility is that the host–guest relationship may have no permanent physical contact, as in the brood parasitism of the cuckoo.

==Hosts to parasites==

Parasites follow a wide variety of evolutionary strategies, placing their hosts in an equally wide range of relationships. Parasitism implies host–parasite coevolution, including the maintenance of gene polymorphisms in the host, where there is a trade-off between the advantage of resistance to a parasite and a cost such as disease caused by the gene.

===Types of hosts===
*Definitive or primary host – an organism in which the parasite reaches the adult stage and reproduces sexually, if possible. This is the final host.
*Secondary or intermediate host – an organism that harbors the sexually immature parasite and is required by the parasite to undergo development and complete its life cycle. It often acts as a vector of the parasite to reach its definitive host. For example, &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot;, the heartworm of dogs, uses the mosquito as its intermediate host until it matures into the infective L3 larval stage.

It is not always easy or even possible to identify which host is definitive and which secondary. The life cycles of many parasites are not well understood, and the subjectively or economically more important organism may initially be designated incorrectly as primary. Mislabelling may continue even after the error becomes known. For example trout and salmon are sometimes said to be &quot;primary hosts&quot; for salmonid whirling disease, even though the myxosporean parasite reproduces sexually inside the sludge worm. And where the host harbors the different parasite&#x27;s phases at different sites within its body, the host is both intermediate and definitive: for example trichinosis, a disease caused by roundworms, where the host has immature juveniles in its muscles and reproductive adults in its digestive tract.

*Paratenic or transport host – an organism that harbors the sexually immature parasite but is not necessary for the parasite&#x27;s development cycle to progress. Paratenic hosts serve as &quot;dumps&quot; for non-mature stages of a parasite in which they can accumulate in high numbers. The trematode &quot;Alaria americana&quot; is an example: the so-called mesocercarial stages of this parasite reside in tadpoles, which are rarely eaten by the definitive canine host. The tadpoles (or the frogs, following metamorphosis) are more frequently preyed on by snakes, which then function as paratenic hosts: the mesocercariae do not undergo further development there, but may accumulate, and infect the definitive host once the snake is consumed by a canid. The nematode &quot;Skrjabingylus nasicola&quot; is another example, with slugs as the intermediate hosts, shrews and rodents as the paratenic hosts, and mustelids as the definitive hosts.
*Dead-end, incidental, or accidental host – an organism that generally does not allow transmission to the definitive host, thereby preventing the parasite from completing its development. For example, humans and horses are dead-end hosts for West Nile virus, whose life cycle is normally between culicine mosquitoes and birds. People and horses can become infected, but the level of virus in their blood does not become high enough to pass on the infection to mosquitoes that bite them.
*Reservoir host – an organism that harbors a pathogen but suffers no ill effects. However, it serves as a source of infection to other species that are susceptible, with important implications for disease control. A reservoir host individual may be reinfected several times.

===Plant hosts of micropredators===

Micropredation is an evolutionarily stable strategy within parasitism, in which a small predator lives parasitically on a much larger host plant, eating parts of it.

The range of plants on which a herbivorous insect feeds is known as its host range. This can be wide or narrow, but it never includes all plants. A small number of insects are monophagous, feeding on a single plant. The silkworm larva is one of these, with mulberry leaves being the only food consumed. More often, an insect with a limited host range is oligophagous, being restricted to a few closely related species, usually in the same plant family. The diamondback moth is an example of this, feeding exclusively on brassicas, and the larva of the potato tuber moth feeds on potatoes, tomatoes and tobacco, all members of the same plant family, Solanaceae. Herbivorous insects with a wide range of hosts in various different plant families are known as polyphagous. One example is the buff ermine moth whose larvae feed on alder, mint, plantain, oak, rhubarb, currant, blackberry, dock, ragwort, nettle and honeysuckle.

Plants often produce toxic or unpalatable secondary metabolites to deter herbivores from feeding on them. Monophagous insects have developed specific adaptations to overcome those in their specialist hosts, giving them an advantage over polyphagous species. However, this puts them at greater risk of extinction if their chosen hosts suffer setbacks. Monophagous species are able to feed on the tender young foliage with high concentrations of damaging chemicals on which polyphagous species cannot feed, having to make do with older leaves. There is a trade off between offspring quality and quantity; the specialist maximises the chances of its young thriving by paying great attention to the choice of host, while the generalist produces larger numbers of eggs in sub-optimal conditions.

Some insect micropredators migrate regularly from one host to another. The hawthorn-carrot aphid overwinters on its primary host, a hawthorn tree, and migrates during the summer to its secondary host, a plant in the carrot family.

===Host range===
The host range is the set of hosts that a parasite can use as a partner. In the case of human parasites, the host range influences the epidemiology of the parasitism or disease.
====Host range of viruses====
For instance, the production of antigenic shifts in Influenza A virus can result from pigs being infected with the virus from several different hosts (such as human and bird). This co-infection provides an opportunity for mixing of the viral genes between existing strains, thereby producing a new viral strain. An influenza vaccine produced against an existing viral strain might not be effective against this new strain, which then requires a new influenza vaccine to be prepared for the protection of the human population.

==Non-parasitic associations==
===Mutualistic hosts===

Some hosts participate in fully mutualistic interactions with both organisms being completely dependent on the other. For example, termites are hosts to the protozoa that live in their gut and which digest cellulose, and the human gut flora is essential for efficient digestion. Many corals and other marine invertebrates house zooxanthellae, single-celled algae, in their tissues. The host provides a protected environment in a well-lit position for the algae, while benefiting itself from the nutrients produced by photosynthesis which supplement its diet. &quot;Lamellibrachia luymesi&quot;, a deep sea giant tubeworm, has an obligate mutualistic association with internal, sulfide-oxidizing, bacterial symbionts. The tubeworm extracts the chemicals that the bacteria need from the sediment, and the bacteria supply the tubeworm, which has no mouth, with nutrients. Some hermit crabs place pieces of sponge on the shell in which they are living. These grow over and eventually dissolve away the mollusc shell; the crab may not ever need to replace its abode again and is well-camouflaged by the overgrowth of sponge.

An important hosting relationship is mycorrhiza, a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a vascular host plant. The fungus receives carbohydrates, the products of photosynthesis, while the plant receives phosphates and nitrogenous compounds acquired by the fungus from the soil. Over 95% of plant families have been shown to have mycorrhizal associations. Another such relationship is between leguminous plants and certain nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia that form nodules on the roots of the plant. The host supplies the bacteria with the energy needed for nitrogen fixation and the bacteria provide much of the nitrogen needed by the host. Such crops as beans, peas, chickpeas and alfalfa are able to fix nitrogen in this way, and mixing clover with grasses increases the yield of pastures.

Neurotransmitter tyramine produced by commensal &quot;Providencia&quot; bacteria, which colonize the gut of the nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, bypasses the requirement for its host to biosynthesise tyramine. This product is then probably converted to octopamine by the host enzyme tyramine β-hydroxylase and manipulates a host sensory decision.

===Hosts in cleaning symbiosis===
Hosts of many species are involved in cleaning symbiosis, both in the sea and on land, making use of smaller animals to clean them of parasites. Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; hosts or clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. The host appears to benefit from the interaction, but biologists have disputed whether this is a truly mutualistic relationship or something closer to parasitism by the cleaner.

===Commensal hosts===
Remoras (also called suckerfish) can swim freely but have evolved suckers that enable them to adhere to smooth surfaces, gaining a free ride (phoresis), and they spend most of their lives clinging to a host animal such as a whale, turtle or shark. However, the relationship may be mutualistic, as remoras, though not generally considered to be cleaner fish, often consume parasitic copepods: for example, these are found in the stomach contents of 70% of the common remora. Many molluscs, barnacles and polychaete worms attach themselves to the carapace of the Atlantic horseshoe crab; for some this is a convenient arrangement, but for others it is an obligate form of commensalism and they live nowhere else.

==History==
The first host to be noticed in ancient times was human: human parasites such as hookworm are recorded from ancient Egypt from 3000 BC onwards, while in ancient Greece, the Hippocratic Corpus describes human bladder worm. The medieval Persian physician Avicenna recorded human and animal parasites including roundworms, threadworms, the Guinea worm and tapeworms. In Early Modern times, Francesco Redi recorded animal parasites, while the microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed and illustrated the protozoan &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; from &quot;his own loose stools&quot;.

Hosts to mutualistic symbionts were recognised more recently, when in 1877 Albert Bernhard Frank described the mutualistic relationship between a fungus and an alga in lichens.

<doc id="214055" wikidata="Q16947517" url="?curid=214055" title="Host (psychology)">
<text>In psychology and mental health, the host is the most prominent personality, state, or identity in someone who has dissociative identity disorder (DID) (formerly known as multiple personality disorder). The other personalities, besides the host, are known as alter personalities, or just &quot;alters&quot;. The host may or may not be the original personality, which is the personality a person is born with. Additionally, the host may or may not be the personality that coincides with the official legal name of the person. Often this is thought to be the root of the person&#x27;s psyche, or at least a key figure for completion of therapy, whether or not it has integration of the host and alters as a goal.

There are arguments that a person can have multiple hosts.

== Prevalence ==
In some very mild forms of DID, the host can be present for extended periods of time, up to years without ever allowing an alter to take the forefront. In these cases, the host is very resilient to stress and other factors that often cause switches.

In severe cases, there is often large amounts of switching and the person may not spend that much time in any state, including the host. In cases where the host is often present, there are a few triggers that can cause the host to retreat.

== Treatment ==
The host is often the personality that seeks treatment. Therefore, the psychotherapists often deal primarily with the host personality. Part of the therapeutic process for DID involves helping the host recognize the alters and become aware when the alters are present. In some cases, the host is unaware of any alters or even that they have DID. In other cases, the host is aware of their condition, but they may not be aware of what the alters are or what they do while in those states. There are situations where the host wants therapy; however, one or more of the alters does not and can try to end the therapeutic process. While the host is aware of the person&#x27;s body, the alters are not always aware that they share the same body as the host, which can lead to belief that suicide would have no effect on the host.

== Brain scans ==
Brain scans can be used to distinguish between host and alter personalities. The host often shows higher EEG coherence than alter personalities. This difference provides objective evidence that there is different neuronal activity between host and alter personalities. There has been brain scan evidence to show that stressful or traumatic memories are often much more present in the alter personalities than the host.

== Legal impact ==
There are mixed views on how to treat people with DID in legal situations. Arguments have been made that each alter should be treated as an independent person. Other arguments have been made that a person should only be responsible if it is the host personality that committed the crime. Since the host may not use the official name of the person, there can be disputes on which identities are responsible for an action.

<doc id="214059" wikidata="Q383469" url="?curid=214059" title="Aphelocoma">
<text>The passerine birds of the genus Aphelocoma include the scrub jays and their relatives. They are New World jays found in Mexico, western Central America and the western United States, with an outlying population in Florida. This genus belongs to the group of New World (or &quot;blue&quot;) jays—possibly a distinct subfamily–which is not closely related to other jays, magpies or treepies. Within this group, according to a 2023 molecular analysis, &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; is the sister group to a clade consisting of &quot;Cyanocitta&quot; and &quot;Gymnorhinus&quot;. They live in open pine-oak forests, chaparral, and mixed evergreen forests.

==Systematics==
Seven species of &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; are generally recognized at the present time. They are believed to have evolved in the Pleistocene, and the Florida scrub jay is known to have been recognizably distinct and present in its current range for at least two million years. The inland, coastal, and Santa Cruz island populations of the (former) western scrub-jay are now considered three separate species: Woodhouse&#x27;s, the California and the island scrub jays. Two different populations of the Mexican jay might similarly represent two separate species.

mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data is unable to properly resolve the relationships of the species. Judging from New World jay biogeography, the unicolored or Mexican jays might represent the most basal lineage; morphology would tentatively lean towards the latter which retains more of the group&#x27;s color patterns, while the available molecular data allows no robust conclusions whatsoever. In any case, the data of Rice et al. (2003) suggests – albeit also with very low confidence – that the Mexican jay comprises two clades which might constitute two separate species. However, far too few individuals have been sampled to say anything definite on that matter, except that the lineages – if they indeed exist – do not correspond to the geographical pattern of intraspecific variation (see species article for more).

The western scrub-jay is now made up of three species. These would be separated by the Great Basin, with the Pacific coastal lineage (California scrub-jay) and the island scrub-jay, as well as the inland lineage (Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub-jay), with the Florida scrub-jay being a sister species. This treatment fails to address the problem of birds from inland southern Mexico. Nonetheless, it is actually &quot;because&quot; the molecular diversity pattern is so badly resolved that it supports the view that rapid Late Pliocene radiation of the North American scrub-jays led to the present diversity. Studies on the evolutionary history of &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays suggests that all New World jays originated in North America or Mesoamerica.






==Description==
&quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays are slightly larger than the Blue Jay and differ in having a longer tail, slightly shorter, more rounded wings, and no crest on the head. The top of the head, nape, and sides of the head are a rich deep blue. Some species have a white stripe above the eye and dark ear coverts. The breast is also white or grey-white and the back is a grey-brown contrasting with the bright blue tail and wings in most species. One species, the Unicolored Jay, is blue all over, superficially similar to the Pinyon Jay from much further north. The bill, legs, and feet are black.

==Behavior==
The diet consists mainly of acorns and pine nuts. However, grain, berries, and other fruits are often eaten as well. These birds can also be omnivorous; their diet can include insects, eggs and nestlings, small frogs, mice, and reptiles. As food-storing birds, the scrub jays demonstrate a unique episodic memory. They can find their food hiding places with great precision, even several days after the initial cache.

Wild &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays are frequent visitors at campsites and picnics and have frequently learned to eat from the hands of people where they have become accustomed to being fed.

The nest is in a tree or a bush, sometimes quite low down. The nests are compact and lined with hair and fine roots with an outer diameter of about 30 cm to 60 cm. Usually two to four eggs are laid and incubated over 14 to 16 days. There are two main variations of egg shell color: green with olive markings or a paler background of grayish-white to green with red-brown markings. The Florida scrub jay and the Mexican jay both have cooperative breeding systems involving several &#x27;helpers&#x27; at each nest, usually relatives of the breeding pair.

Increased prolactin in the breeding pair leads to the expression of parental behavior and physiology. The source of the alloparental behavior found in helper birds has been the focus of many studies. A positive correlation was found between increased prolactin levels during the breeding period and helping behavior in non-breeding &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays. This suggests that helper birds do not simply respond to the calls of the young, but begin to show parental behavior even before the chicks hatch. These data suggest that natural selection may be acting on cooperative breeding in &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays and New World jays in general because the birds are reacting to more than just an environmental stimulus. Studies have also been done on Florida scrub jays (&quot;Aphelocoma coerulescens&quot;) and results have confirmed the hypothesis that increased prolactin levels are correlated with an increase in parental behavior in helper birds. Scrub jays are members of the family Corvidae, which are considered the most intelligent of the birds and among the most intelligent of all animals.

&quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays are quite vocal and have a huge range of sounds and calls; common calls include a &quot;cheek, cheek, cheek&quot; and a guttural churring &quot;krr&#x27;r&#x27;r&#x27;r&#x27;r&quot;. &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays are also, like all other jays, often quite aggressive, antagonistic at feeding areas and sometimes regarded as a nuisance.

<doc id="214067" wikidata="Q271818" url="?curid=214067" title="Virgo Cluster">
<text>The Virgo Cluster is a cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 ± 0.3 Mly (16.5 ± 0.1 Mpc) away in the Virgo constellation. Comprising approximately 1,300 (and possibly up to 2,000) member galaxies, the cluster forms the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group (containing the Milky Way galaxy) is a member. The Local Group actually experiences the mass of the Virgo Supercluster as the Virgocentric flow. It is estimated that the Virgo Cluster&#x27;s mass is 1.2 out to 8 degrees of the cluster&#x27;s center or a radius of about 2.2 Mpc.

Many of the brighter galaxies in this cluster, including the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, were discovered in the late 1770s and early 1780s and subsequently included in Charles Messier&#x27;s catalogue of non-cometary fuzzy objects. Described by Messier as nebulae without stars, their true nature was not recognized until the 1920s.

The cluster extends across approximately 8 degrees centered in the constellation Virgo. Some of its most prominent members can be seen with binoculars and small telescopes, while a 6-inch telescope will reveal about 160 of the cluster&#x27;s galaxies on a clear night. Its brightest member is the elliptical galaxy Messier 49.

== Characteristics ==
The cluster is a fairly heterogeneous mixture of spiral and elliptical galaxies. , it is believed that the spiral galaxies of the cluster are distributed in an oblong prolate filament, approximately four times as long as it is wide, stretching along the line of sight from the Milky Way. The elliptical galaxies are more centrally concentrated than the spiral galaxies.

The cluster is an aggregate of at least three separate subclumps: Virgo A, centered on M87, a second centered on the galaxy M86, and Virgo B, centered on M49, with some authors including a Virgo C subcluster, centered on the galaxy M60 as well as a Low Velocity Cloud (LVC) subclump, centered on the large spiral galaxy NGC 4216. The giant elliptical galaxy M87 contains a supermassive black hole, whose event horizon was observed by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration in 2019.

Virgo A is the dominant subclump; its mass of approximately 1014 is approximately ten times larger than the other two subclumps. It contains a mixture of elliptical, lenticular, and spiral galaxies which are generally gas-poor,

The three subgroups are in the process of merging to form a larger single cluster, and are surrounded by other smaller galaxy clouds, mostly composed of spiral galaxies, known as N Cloud, S Cloud, and Virgo E that are in the process of infalling to merge with them, plus other farther isolated galaxies and galaxy groups (like the galaxy cloud Coma I) that are also attracted by the gravity of Virgo to merge with it in the future. This strongly suggests the Virgo cluster is a dynamically young cluster that is still forming.

Nearby aggregations known as M Cloud, W Cloud, and W&#x27; Cloud seem to be background systems independent of the main cluster.

The large mass of the cluster is indicated by the high peculiar velocities of many of its galaxies, sometimes as high as 1,600 km/s with respect to the cluster&#x27;s center.

The Virgo cluster lies within the Virgo Supercluster, and its gravitational effect slows down the nearby galaxies. The large mass of the cluster has the effect of slowing down the recession of the Local Group from the cluster by approximately ten percent.

Molecular gasses in Virgo Cluster has been swept away by a huge cosmic broom that is preventing nearby galaxies from birthing new stars. The actual cause of it has been a long standing mystery in astrophysics. According to scientists, it occurs because of the extreme environment of the Virgo Cluster.

== Intracluster medium ==
As with many other rich galaxy clusters, Virgo&#x27;s intracluster medium is filled with a hot, rarefied plasma at temperatures of 30 million kelvins that emits X-Rays. Within the intracluster medium (ICM) are found a large number of intergalactic stars (up to 10% of the stars in the cluster), including some planetary nebulae. It is theorized that these were expelled from their home galaxies by interactions with other galaxies. The ICM also contains some globular clusters, possibly stripped off dwarf galaxies, and even at least one star formation region.

== Galaxies ==
Below is a table of bright or notable objects in the cluster and their subcluster. In some cases a galaxy may be considered to be in a different subcluster by other researchers (sources:)

:Column 1: The name of the galaxy.
:Column 2: The right ascension for epoch 2000.
:Column 3: The declination for epoch 2000.
:Column 4: The blue apparent magnitude of the galaxy.
:Column 5: The galaxy type: E=Elliptical, S0=Lenticular, Sa,Sb,Sc,Sd=Spiral, SBa,SBb,SBc,SBd=Barred spiral, Sm,SBm,Irr=Irregular.
:Column 6: The angular diameter of the galaxy (arcminutes).
:Column 7: The diameter of the galaxy (thousands of light years).
:Column 8: The recessional velocity (km/s) of the galaxy relative to the cosmic microwave background.
:Column 9: Subcluster where the galaxy is located.

Fainter galaxies within the cluster are usually known by their numbers in the Virgo Cluster Catalog, particularly members of the numerous dwarf galaxy population.

<doc id="214069" wikidata="Q70255611" url="?curid=214069" title="Eastern Gobi desert steppe">
<text>The Eastern Gobi desert steppe is a deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregion in Mongolia and northern China. It is the easternmost of the ecoregions that make up the larger Gobi Desert. It lies between the more humid Mongolian–Manchurian grassland on the north, east, and southeast, and the drier Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the west.

==Geography==
The ecoregion lies on a plateau, mostly between 1000 and 1500 meters elevation. The ecoregion extends southwest along the Yin Mountains, which rise between 1,500 and 2,200 meters elevation.

There are no large rivers in the ecoregion. Most of the ecoregion lies in closed basins, with intermittent streams that drain into salt pans and small ponds.

==Climate==
The climate is arid and continental. Winters are intensely cold, with January mean temperatures of . Summers are warm to hot, depending on elevation. The mean annual temperature ranges from -2 to -6 °C. Annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 150 mm, falling mostly in the summer, and varies considerably from year to year.

==Flora==
The predominant vegetation is a steppe of drought-tolerant shrubs and low grasses. The legumes &quot;Caragana bungei&quot; and &quot;Caragana leucocephala&quot; are characteristic shrubs. Other shrubs include gray sparrow&#x27;s saltwort (&quot;Salsola passerina&quot;), gray sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia xerophytica&quot;), &quot;Potaninia mongolica&quot;, and &quot;Nitraria sibirica&quot;. Common grasses include the needle grasses &quot;Stipa gobica&quot; and &quot;Stipa glareosa&quot; and bridlegrass (&quot;Cleistogenes soongorica&quot;). The taana wild onion (&quot;Allium polyrhizum&quot;) is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential in producing the proper, hazelnut-like notes of camel airag (fermented milk).

==Fauna==
Large mammals in the ecoregion include the Mongolian wild ass (&quot;Equus hemionus hemionus&quot;), Mongolian saiga antelope (&quot;Saiga tartarica mongolica&quot;), Yarkand gazelle (&quot;Gazella subgutturosa&quot;), and marbled polecat (&quot;Vormela peregusna&quot;). Several species of jerboas (family Dipodidae) are found in sandy areas. Jerboas are small mammals with long hindlegs and tails, adapted to burrowing and able to jump up to three meters. Native jerboa species include the long-eared jerboa (&quot;Euchoreutus naso&quot;), Kozlov&#x27;s pygmy jerboa (&quot;Salpingotus kozlovi&quot;), Mongolian jerboa (&quot;Stylodipus andewsi&quot;), and Gobi jerboa (&quot;Allactaga bullata&quot;).

Native birds include the lammergeier (&quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;), cinereous vulture (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), MacQueen&#x27;s bustard (&quot;Chlamydotis macqueenii&quot;), chukar partridge (&quot;Alectoris chukar&quot;), Pallas&#x27;s sandgrouse (&quot;Syrrhaptes paradoxus&quot;), Mongolian ground jay (&quot;Podoces hendersoni&quot;), greater sand plover (&quot;Charadrius leschenaultii&quot;), and Mongolian finch (&quot;Bucanetes mongolicus&quot;).

==Human use==
The vast desert is crisscrossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from Kalgan (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar (); from Jiuquan (in Gansu) to Hami ; from Hami to Beijing (); from Hohhot to Hami and Barkul; and from Lanzhou (in Gansu) to Hami.

==Protected areas==
3.34% of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Wuliangsuhainiaolei Protected Area, Ergeliin Zoo Nature Reserve, Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve, Zagiin us Nature Reserve, Gobiin baga Strictly Protected Area, Ongon Tavan bulag Nature Reserve, Delgerkhangai mountain Nature Reserve, and Burdene bulag Nature Reserve.

Electrical plants in the region produced 242.2 thousand electric engines (alternating current), 4800 transformers, 899 thousand lamps. Brest lamp factory is producing incandescent light bulbs, 2 factories are engaged in production of diodes and printed circuit boards.

Byarozaŭskaja (Berezovskaya) thermal power plant in Byaroza District is one of the biggest power plants in Belarus (1095 MW, 4.8 GW·h annually). As of 2018, it had 4 power generating units with combined cycle gas turbines.

As of 2017, total cultivated area in the region was 930,000 hectares, including 844,400 hectares of land used by agricultural organizations (mainly state-owned), 17,900 hectares — by the registered farmers, and 67,700 hectares — by personal farms of the population. 383,800 hectares of fields were used to grow cereals, 52,800 — rapeseeds, 21,800 — sugar beets, 5,700 — flax, 56,300 — potatoes, 12,700 — vegetables, 392,800 — feed crops. Big agricultural organizations harvest almost all cereals, flax, sugar beets, rapeseeds and feed crops, while farmers (both registered and not) harvest more than 90% of potatoes (1,144,400 tons of 1,266,200 in the region) and vegetables (409,400 tons of 439,200 in the region). Average cereal yield in the region in 2017 was 3,480 kg per hectare (average in Belarus — 3,330), sugar beet yield — 43,900 kg per hectare (average in Belarus — 49,900), flax fiber yield — 1,160 kg per hectare (average in Belarus — 920). Due to warm mild climate and personal activity, the region leads in the production of many fruits, vegetables and berries in Belarus. Several villages are widely known as a &quot;cucumber capital&quot;, &quot;strawberry capital&quot;, &quot;carrot capital&quot;, etc.

As of 2018, agricultural organizations and farmers kept 861,600 cattle (including 301,100 cows), 491,100 pigs, 10,000 horses, 19,500 sheep, 7,605,000 poultry. In 2017, all types of farms in the region produced 218,700 tons of livestock and poultry meat (in slaughter weight), 1,605,000 tons of milk (second place among the regions of Belarus) and 606.8 million eggs (second place).

<text>Messier 87 (also known as Virgo A or NGC 4486, generally abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo that contains several trillion stars. One of the largest and most massive galaxies in the local universe, it has a large population of globular clusters—about 15,000 compared with the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and a jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends at least , traveling at a relativistic speed. It is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky and a popular target for both amateur and professional astronomers.

The French astronomer Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, and cataloged it as a nebula. M87 is about from Earth and is the second-brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, having many satellite galaxies. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, it has an almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the center. Forming around one-sixth of its mass, M87&#x27;s stars have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution. Their population density decreases with increasing distance from the core. It has an active supermassive black hole at its core, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. The black hole was imaged using data collected in 2017 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), with a final, processed image released on 10 April 2019. In March 2021, the EHT Collaboration presented, for the first time, a polarized-based image of the black hole which may help better reveal the forces giving rise to quasars.

The galaxy is a strong source of multi-wavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. It has an isophotal diameter of , with a diffuse galactic envelope that extends to a radius of about , where it is truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Its interstellar medium consists of diffuse gas enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.

==Observation history==
In 1781, the French astronomer Charles Messier published a catalogue of 103 objects that had a nebulous appearance as part of a list intended to identify objects that might otherwise be confused with comets. In subsequent use, each catalogue entry was prefixed with an &quot;M&quot;. Thus, M87 was the eighty-seventh object listed in Messier&#x27;s catalogue. During the 1880s, the object was included as NGC 4486 in the &quot;New General Catalogue&quot; of nebulae and star clusters assembled by the Danish-Irish astronomer John Dreyer, which he based primarily on the observations of the English astronomer John Herschel.

In 1918, the American astronomer Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory noted M87&#x27;s lack of a spiral structure and observed a &quot;curious straight ray ... apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter.&quot; The ray appeared brightest near the galactic center. The following year, supernova SN 1919A within M87 reached a peak photographic magnitude of 11.5, although this event was not reported until photographic plates were examined by the Russian astronomer Innokentii A. Balanowski in 1922.

===Identification as a galaxy===

In 1922, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble categorized M87 as one of the brighter globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but like spiral nebulae, appeared to belong to the family of non-galactic nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization, distinguishing extragalactic from galactic nebulae, the former being independent star systems. M87 was classified as a type of elliptical extragalactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0).

In 1931, Hubble described M87 as a member of the Virgo Cluster, and gave a provisional estimate of from Earth. It was then the only known elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved, although it was pointed out that globular clusters would be indistinguishable from individual stars at such distances. In his 1936 &quot;The Realm of the Nebulae&quot;, Hubble examines the terminology of the day; some astronomers labeled extragalactic nebulae as &quot;external galaxies&quot; on the basis that they were stellar systems at far distances from our own galaxy, while others preferred the conventional term &quot;extragalactic nebulae&quot;, as &quot;galaxy&quot; was at that time a synonym for the Milky Way. M87 continued to be labelled as an extragalactic nebula at least until 1954.

===Modern research===
In 1947, a prominent radio source, Virgo A, was identified with errors in its measured position that overlapped the location of M87. The source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from the core of the galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–1970, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.
In 1966, the United States Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s Aerobee 150 rocket identified Virgo X-1, the first X-ray source in Virgo. The Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on 7 July 1967 yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.

M87 has been an important testing ground for techniques that measure the masses of central supermassive black holes in galaxies. In 1978, stellar-dynamical modeling of the mass distribution in M87 gave evidence for a central mass of five billion solar masses. After the installation of the COSTAR corrective-optics module in the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993, the Hubble Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was used to measure the rotation velocity of the ionized gas disk at the center of M87, as an &quot;early release observation&quot; designed to test the scientific performance of the post-repair Hubble instruments. The FOS data indicated a central black hole mass of 2.4 billion , with 30% uncertainty. Globular clusters within M87 have been used to calibrate metallicity relations as well.

M87 was observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) during much of 2017. The event horizon of the black hole at the center was directly imaged by the EHT, then revealed in a press conference on the issue date stated, filtering out from this the first image of a black hole&#x27;s shadow.

==Visibility==
M87 is near a high declination limit of the Virgo constellation, abutting Coma Berenices. It lies along the line between the stars Epsilon Virginis and Denebola (Beta Leonis). The galaxy can be observed using a small telescope with a aperture, extending across an angular area of at a surface brightness of 12.9, with a very bright, 45 arcsecond core. Viewing the jet is a challenge without the aid of photography. Before 1991, the Ukrainian-American astronomer Otto Struve was the only person known to have seen the jet visually, using the Hooker telescope. In more recent years it has been observed in larger amateur telescopes under excellent conditions.

==Properties==
In the modified Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of the French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. &quot;E0&quot; designates an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A &quot;p&quot; suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity is the presence of the jet emerging from the core. In the Yerkes (Morgan) scheme, M87 is classified as a type-cD galaxy. A D galaxy has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope. A D type supergiant is called a cD galaxy.

The distance to M87 has been estimated using several independent techniques. These include measurement of the luminosity of planetary nebulae, comparison with nearby galaxies whose distance is estimated using standard candles such as cepheid variables, the linear size distribution of globular clusters, and the tip of the red-giant branch method using individually resolved red giant stars. These measurements are consistent with each other, and their weighted average yields a distance estimate of .

M87 is one of the most massive galaxies in the local Universe. Its diameter is estimated at 132,000 light-years, which is approximately 51% larger than that of the Milky Way. As an elliptical galaxy, the galaxy is a spheroid rather than a flattened disc, accounting for the substantially larger mass of M87. Within a radius of , the mass is times the mass of the Sun, which is double the mass of the Milky Way galaxy. As with other galaxies, only a fraction of this mass is in the form of stars: M87 has an estimated mass to luminosity ratio of ; that is, only about one part in six of the galaxy&#x27;s mass is in the form of stars that radiate energy. This ratio varies from 5 to 30, approximately in proportion to in the region of from the core. The total mass of M87 may be 200 times that of the Milky Way.

The galaxy experiences an infall of gas at the rate of two to three solar masses per year, most of which may be accreted onto the core region. The extended stellar envelope of this galaxy reaches a radius of about , compared with about for the Milky Way. Beyond that distance the outer edge of the galaxy has been truncated by some means; possibly by an earlier encounter with another galaxy. There is evidence of linear streams of stars to the northwest of the galaxy, which may have been created by tidal stripping of orbiting galaxies or by small satellite galaxies falling in toward M87. Moreover, a filament of hot, ionized gas in the northeastern outer part of the galaxy may be the remnant of a small, gas-rich galaxy that was disrupted by M87 and could be feeding its active nucleus. M87 is estimated to have at least 50 satellite galaxies, including NGC 4486B and NGC 4478.

The spectrum of the nuclear region of M87 shows the emission lines of various ions, including hydrogen (HI, HII), helium (HeI), oxygen (OI, OII, OIII), nitrogen (NI), magnesium (MgII), and sulfur (SII). The line intensities for weakly ionized atoms (such as neutral atomic oxygen, OI) are stronger than those of strongly ionized atoms (such as doubly ionized oxygen, OIII). A galactic nucleus with such spectral properties is termed a LINER, for &quot;low-ionization nuclear emission-line region&quot;. The mechanism and source of weak-line-dominated ionization in LINERs and M87 are under debate. Possible causes include shock-induced excitation in the outer parts of the disk or photoionization in the inner region powered by the jet.

Elliptical galaxies such as M87 are believed to form as the result of one or more mergers of smaller galaxies. They generally contain relatively little cold interstellar gas (in comparison with spiral galaxies) and they are populated mostly by old stars, with little or no ongoing star formation. M87&#x27;s elliptical shape is maintained by the random orbital motions of its constituent stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way. Using the Very Large Telescope to study the motions of about 300 planetary nebulae, astronomers have determined that M87 absorbed a medium-sized star-forming spiral galaxy over the last billion years. This has resulted in the addition of some younger, bluer stars to M87. The distinctive spectral properties of the planetary nebulae allowed astronomers to discover a chevron-like structure in M87&#x27;s halo which was produced by the incomplete phase-space mixing of a disrupted galaxy.
==Components==
===Supermassive black hole M87*===
The core of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole (SMBH), designated M87*, whose mass is billions of times that of the Earth&#x27;s Sun; estimates had ranged from   to  , surpassed by   in 2016. In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration released measurements of the black hole&#x27;s mass as . This is one of the highest known masses for such an object. A rotating disk of ionized gas surrounds the black hole, and is roughly perpendicular to the relativistic jet. The disk rotates at velocities of up to roughly and spans a maximum diameter of . By comparison, Pluto averages from the Sun. Gas accretes onto the black hole at an estimated rate of one solar mass every ten years (about 90 Earth masses per day). The Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is . The diameter of the ring of emission, as seen from Earth, is 42 μas (microarcsecond). By comparison, the diameter of the core of M87 is 45&quot; (as, arcsecond), and the size of M87 is 7.2&#x27; x 6.8&#x27; (am, arcminute).

A 2010 paper suggested that the black hole may be displaced from the galactic center by about . This was claimed to be in the opposite direction of the known jet, indicating acceleration of the black hole by it. Another suggestion was that the offset occurred during the merger of two supermassive black holes. However, a 2011 study did not find any statistically significant displacement, and a 2018 study of high-resolution images of M87 concluded that the apparent spatial offset was caused by temporal variations in the jet&#x27;s brightness rather than a physical displacement of the black hole from the galaxy&#x27;s center.

This black hole is the first to be imaged. Data to produce the image were taken in April 2017, the image was produced during 2018 and was published on 10 April 2019. The image shows the shadow of the black hole, surrounded by an asymmetric emission ring with a diameter of . The shadow radius is 2.6 times that of the black hole&#x27;s Schwarzschild radius. The asymmetry in the brightness of the ring is due to relativistic beaming, whereby material moving towards the observer at relativistic velocities appears brighter. The visible material around the black hole rotates mostly clockwise with respect to the observer, which due to the direction of the axis of rotation causes the bottom part of the emission region to have a component of velocity toward the observer. The rotation parameter was estimated at formula_1, corresponding to a rotation speed 
This is consistent with the value of formula_2
obtained with the outflow method. 

After the black hole had been imaged, it was named Pōwehi, a Hawaiian word meaning &quot;the adorned fathomless dark creation&quot;, taken from the ancient creation chant Kumulipo.

On 24 March 2021, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration revealed an unprecedented unique view of the M87 black hole shadow: how it looks in polarized light. Polarization is a powerful tool which allows astronomers to probe physics behind the image in more detail. Light polarization informs us about the strength and orientation of magnetic fields in the ring of light around the black hole shadow. Knowing those is essential to understand how M87&#x27;s supermassive black hole is launching jets of magnetized plasma, which expand at relativistic speeds beyond the M87 galaxy.

On 14 April 2021, astronomers further reported that the M87 black hole and its surroundings were studied during Event Horizon Telescope 2017 observing run also by many multi-wavelength observatories from around the world.

In April 2023, a team developed a new principal-component interferometric modeling (PRIMO) technique to produce sharper image reconstructions from EHT data. They applied this to the original EHT observations of the M87 black hole, yielding a crisper final image and allowing closer testing of the alignment of observations to theory.

===Jet===
The relativistic jet of matter emerging from the core extends at least from the nucleus and consists of matter ejected from a supermassive black hole. The jet is highly collimated, appearing constrained to an angle of 60° within of the core, to about 16° at , and to 6–7° at . Its base has the diameter of and is probably powered by a prograde accretion disk around the spinning supermassive black hole. The German-American astronomer Walter Baade found that light from the jet was plane polarized, which suggests that the energy is generated by the acceleration of electrons moving at relativistic velocities in a magnetic field. The total energy of these electrons is estimated at ergs ( or ). This is roughly  times the energy produced in the entire Milky Way in one second, which is estimated at The jet is surrounded by a lower-velocity non-relativistic component. There is evidence of a counter jet, but it remains unseen from the Earth due to relativistic beaming. The jet is precessing, causing the outflow to form a helical pattern out to . Lobes of expelled matter extend out to .

In pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87&#x27;s jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This phenomenon, called superluminal motion, is an illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet. The time interval between any two light pulses emitted by the jet is, as registered by the observer, less than the actual interval due to the relativistic speed of the jet moving in the direction of the observer. This results in perceived faster-than-light speeds, though the jet itself has a velocity of only 80–85% the speed of light. Detection of such motion is used to support the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It is proposed that the nucleus of M87 is a BL Lacertae object (of lower luminosity than its surrounds) seen from a relatively large angle. Flux variations, characteristic of the BL Lacertae objects, have been observed in M87.
Observations indicate that the rate at which material is ejected from the supermassive black hole is variable. These variations produce pressure waves in the hot gas surrounding M87. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has detected loops and rings in the gas. Their distribution suggests that minor eruptions occur every few million years. One of the rings, caused by a major eruption, is a shock wave in diameter around the black hole. Other features observed include narrow X-ray-emitting filaments up to long, and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago. The regular eruptions prevent a huge reservoir of gas from cooling and forming stars, implying that M87&#x27;s evolution may have been seriously affected, preventing it from becoming a large spiral galaxy.

M87 is a very strong source of gamma rays, the most energetic rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays emitted by M87 have been observed since the late 1990s. In 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period indicates that the most likely source of the gamma rays is a supermassive black hole. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux.

A knot of matter in the jet (designated HST-1), about from the core, has been tracked by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. By 2006, the X-ray intensity of this knot had increased by a factor of 50 over a four-year period, while the X-ray emission has since been decaying in a variable manner.

The interaction of relativistic jets of plasma emanating from the core with the surrounding medium gives rise to radio lobes in active galaxies. The lobes occur in pairs and are often symmetrical. The two radio lobes of M87 together span about 80 kiloparsecs; the inner parts, extending up to 2 kiloparsecs, emit strongly at radio wavelengths. Two flows of material emerge from this region, one aligned with the jet itself and the other in the opposite direction. The flows are asymmetrical and deformed, implying that they encounter a dense intra-cluster medium. At greater distances, both flows diffuse into two lobes. The lobes are surrounded by a fainter halo of radio-emitting gas.

===Interstellar medium===
The space between the stars in M87 is filled with a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by the elements ejected from stars as they passed beyond their main sequence lifetime. Carbon and nitrogen are continuously supplied by stars of intermediate mass as they pass through the asymptotic giant branch. The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are produced largely by supernova explosions within the galaxy. Of the heavy elements, about 60% were produced by core-collapse supernovae, while the remainder came from type Ia supernovae.

The distribution of oxygen is roughly uniform throughout, at about half of the solar value (i.e., oxygen abundance in the Sun), while iron distribution peaks near the center where it approaches the solar iron value. Since oxygen is produced mainly by core-collapse supernovae, which occur during the early stages of galaxies, and mostly in outer star-forming regions, the distribution of these elements suggests an early enrichment of the interstellar medium from core-collapse supernovae and a continuous contribution from type Ia supernovae throughout the history of M87. The contribution of elements from these sources was much lower than in the Milky Way.

Examination of M87 at far infrared wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25 μm. Normally, this may be an indication of thermal emission by warm dust. In the case of M87, the emission can be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet; within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46 million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in M87 is no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way&#x27;s dust equals about a hundred million () solar masses.

Although M87 is an elliptical galaxy and therefore lacks the dust lanes of a spiral galaxy, optical filaments have been observed in it, which arise from gas falling towards the core. Emission probably comes from shock-induced excitation as the falling gas streams encounter X-rays from the core region. These filaments have an estimated mass of about 10,000 . Surrounding the galaxy is an extended corona with hot, low-density gas.

===Globular clusters===
M87 has an abnormally large population of globular clusters. A 2006 survey out to an angular distance of 25′ from the core estimates that there are clusters in orbit around M87, compared with 150–200 in and around the Milky Way. The clusters are similar in size distribution to those of the Milky Way, most having an effective radius of 1 to 6 parsecs. The size of the M87 clusters gradually increases with distance from the galactic center. Within a radius of the core, the cluster metallicity—the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium—is about half the abundance in the Sun. Outside this radius, metallicity steadily declines as the cluster distance from the core increases. Clusters with low metallicity are somewhat larger than metal-rich clusters. In 2014, HVGC-1, the first hypervelocity globular cluster, was discovered escaping from M87 at 2,300 km/s. The escape of the cluster with such a high velocity was speculated to have been the result of a close encounter with, and subsequent gravitational kick from, a supermassive black hole binary.

Almost a hundred ultra-compact dwarfs have been identified in M87. They resemble globular clusters but have a diameter of or more, much larger than the maximum of globular clusters. It is unclear whether they are dwarf galaxies captured by M87 or a new class of massive globular cluster.

==Environment==

M87 is near (or at) the center of the Virgo Cluster, a closely compacted structure of about 2,000 galaxies. This forms the core of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group (including the Milky Way) is an outlying member. It is organized into at least three distinct subsystems associated with the three large galaxies—M87, M49 and M86—with the core subgroup including M87 (&quot;Virgo A&quot;) and M49 (&quot;Virgo B&quot;). There is a preponderance of elliptical and S0 galaxies around M87. A chain of elliptical galaxies roughly aligns with the jet. In terms of mass, M87 is likely to be the largest, and coupled with centrality appears to be moving very little relative to the cluster as a whole. It is defined in one study as the cluster center. The cluster has a sparse gaseous medium that emits X-rays, lower in temperature toward the middle. The combined mass of the cluster is estimated to be 0.15 to 

Measurements of the motion of those intracluster starburst (&quot;planetary&quot;) nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that the two galaxies are moving toward each other and that this may be their first encounter. M87 may have interacted with M84, as evidenced by the truncation of M87&#x27;s outer halo by tidal interactions. The truncated halo may also have been caused by contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 from the rest of the cluster, which may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo&#x27;s formation was truncated by early feedback from the active galactic nucleus.

<text>Arabella Churchill (23 February 1648 – 30 May 1730) was the mistress of King James II and VII, and the mother of four of his children (surnamed FitzJames, that is, &quot;son of James&quot;).

==Life==
 Arabella was a daughter of Sir Winston Churchill and sister of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough; her other brothers were George Churchill, Admiral of the Blue and General Charles Churchill. The Churchills&#x27; loyalty to the royal household was ardent; their only feeling about Arabella&#x27;s seduction by King James II &quot;seems to have been a joyful surprise that so plain a girl had attained such high preferment&quot;. 

James, then Duke of York, began his adulterous affair with Arabella Churchill, around 1665, while he was still married to Anne Hyde. Churchill became the duchess&#x27;s lady-in-waiting in that year, and gave birth to two children during Anne&#x27;s lifetime. Churchill was described as a &quot;tall creature, pale-faced, and nothing but skin and bone&quot;. 

Courtiers cackled &quot;at her appearance until she fell off her horse in front of a crowd, displaying her magnificent legs&quot;. One awestruck witness marvelled that &quot;limbs of such exquisite beauty could belong to Miss Churchill&#x27;s face&quot;.

Charles II, who was baffled by his brother&#x27;s predilection for plain women, joked that his confessor must impose them as a penance. She often displayed the quick wit and lively intelligence which bound James to her through ten years and four children. 

On 1 June 1680 at the Church of Holy Trinity, Minories, London, she married Charles Godfrey and had three more children. They lived happily together for more than three decades.
Godfrey died in 1714, at the age of 67. She survived him by 16 years, dying in 1730 aged 82.

==Children==

<text>James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick (21 August 1670 – 12 June 1734) was a French Royal Army officer and nobleman who was the illegitimate son of James II of England by Arabella Churchill, the sister of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Berwick was a successful general in the service of Louis XIV.

== Early life ==
FitzJames was born at Moulins in France before his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, and was brought up in France as a Catholic. He was the son of James and his mistress Arabella Churchill, sister of the English captain general and statesman John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. He seems to have inherited or perfected the same military ability as his uncle, Marlborough. He was educated at the Stuarts&#x27; expense in the College of Juilly, the Collège du Plessis, and the Jesuit College of La Flèche. He went into the service of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and was present at the siege of Buda. FitzJames was created Duke of Berwick, Earl of Tinmouth and Baron Bosworth by his father in 1687. He then returned to Hungary and participated at the Battle of Mohács.

Berwick returned to England and was made Governor of Portsmouth. King James made him a Knight of the Order of the Garter and appointed him Colonel of The Blues to replace the Protestant Earl of Oxford. The post had been coveted by his maternal uncle the Duke of Marlborough, but FitzJames was earmarked for command, as Catholics replaced Anglicans. However, due to the invasion of The Prince of Orange and the subsequent Glorious Revolution, the installation never took place. Berwick in all conscience could not remain with the Colonel of The Blues&#x27; Troop he had served since 1682; he refused to betray his old &quot;patronne&quot;. Officers were required to answer &#x27;three questions&#x27; designed by the King to test their loyalty. Berwick was with his father at Salisbury, when key units deserted to the Prince of Orange. King James II was overthrown in December 1688 and Berwick went into exile with him.

In 1689 Berwick accompanied his father to Ireland and fought in the Irish campaign at the Siege of Derry, the Battle of Cavan and the Battle of the Boyne during which he led a charge, was unhorsed and almost killed in the melee. When his father departed for France after the Boyne, Berwick remained with the Jacobite Irish Army during the retreat to Limerick.

On 2 August he was one of the Generals, with Patrick Sarsfield and Boisselau, who shored up the defences at Limerick awaiting the Williamite assault; thereafter they rode north across the Shannon with a few Guards. On 22 June 1691, Berwick was with the French general the Marquis de St Ruth, at Aughrim, a site of his choosing when General Ginckel appeared over the hill with a superior force of 18,000 Williamites. The defenders were surrounded on one side by peat bog, and on the other Kilcommodon Hill. Berwick was with Sarsfield&#x27;s corps on the Irish right, who had an uncommitted reserve, when The Blues smashed through the Irish lines on the left, broke the Irish Dragoons, and caused a general panic to ensue. General St Ruth was decapitated by a stray cannonball, but Sarsfield was too late to rescue the situation. He retired with Berwick to the relative safety of Limerick, which Ginckel besieged on 25 August. Under the terms of Treaty of Limerick, signed on 3 October, all Irish contingents were banished to the continent forever. These soldiers became known as the Wild Geese. James II created Berwick Colonel of the 1st Troop, Wild Geese. Berwick arrived too late at the siege of Cork with 4,000 French troops, but unable to effect a result, he withdrew; Marlborough marched west to Kinsale to deal with 18,000 Frenchmen. It was at this time that he undertook a number of secret visits to England on behalf of the Jacobite cause.

== In the service of Louis XIV ==
After his father&#x27;s final exile, Berwick served in the French army under Marshal Luxembourg, including at the battles of Steenkerque. Luxembourg fell into William&#x27;s trap set against superior numbers, but reinforcements failed the Allies, and the French rallied to send the Maison Militaire du Roi infantry downhill. Berwick was in the charge of the division that broke English lines. They were driven from the field with heavy losses. Berwick was one of Luxembourg&#x27;s principal officers, and in 1694 commanded the centre of a large French army. After several forced marches to entrap William, they crossed the Meuse again before stopping them near Neerwinden. Berwick struggled against the Foot Guards, who forced his men to retreat in the Landen. He was taken prisoner by his uncle, Charles Churchill, and ransomed for 30,000 florins; and later was exchanged for a wounded Duke of Ormonde. The Irish peer was accused of allowing himself to fall into enemy hands. The scandal swept Whitehall Palace causing angry questions in Parliament.

At the same time a huge number of 400 ships bound for the Smyrna Convoy were taken by the French. Because of his support for his father and service in the French army against England, he was attainted in 1695 by Act of Parliament rendering his British peerages forfeit.

As a soldier, Berwick was highly esteemed for his courage, abilities and integrity. But when his uncle, Marlborough, challenged the French to fight at Liege, Boufflers retreated. In 1703 he took part in the Battle of Ekeren. In June 1704, Berwick commanded a combined Franco-Spanish army, but they did not seriously challenge the enemy, only taking a few of the Barrier Fortresses. By July 1706 Berwick had established increasing dominance in the north of Spain as the Bourbons&#x27; premier general. In August partizans forced the Earl of Galway to evacuate Madrid allowing Berwick into winter quarters. As a result of distinguished service in the War of the Spanish Succession, he became a French subject and was appointed a Marshal of France after his successful expedition against Nice in 1706.

Louis XIV was in the habit of sending his marshals lengthy orders. In 1707 he wrote the duc de Vendome: &quot;...it will be absolutely necessary for the Duke of Berwick to detach a similar proportion and to send a sufficient number of troops to the Elector of Bavaria...&quot; The French allocated 75 battalions and 140 squadrons to the Rhine front, giving Berwick a comfortable numerical superiority. On 25 April 1707, Berwick won a great and decisive victory at the Almanza, where an Englishman at the head of a Franco-Spanish army defeated Ruvigny, a Frenchman at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Dutch army. Five English, six Dutch, and three Portuguese regiments were captured with all the cannon and regimental colours. The defeat ended Allied hopes of putting the Habsburg candidate on the Spanish throne. Berwick was &quot;the brave English general who had defeated the French&quot; to confused Tories. After Almanza, Berwick was created Duque de Liria y Xérica (English: Duke of Liria and Jérica) and Lieutenant of Aragon by Philip V of Spain in 1707, and Duc de Fitz-James (English: Duke of Fitz-James) in the Peerage of France by Louis XIV in 1710. But in the meantime in July 1707, Berwick heard the Allies had left Maastricht and sent 34 battalions and 75 squadrons north to meet Prince Eugene&#x27;s army. In the spring of 1708, a Dutch force raided Berwick&#x27;s camp at Cenco, killing all the men in their tents, with Berwick expressing shock at the &quot;barbarous&quot; action. By July Berwick had caught up with Vendome&#x27;s army at Oudenarde, but was yet to arrive, anticipating Vendome would retreat to join up his force at Gavre six miles away. But Berwick was at Givet on River Meuse when he heard of Vendome&#x27;s heavy defeat. Berwick rescued 9,000 stragglers, using them to garrison Douai, and then moved Lille, where he prepared to be besieged. However, the English arrived there first and managed to dismantle the defensive ramparts before he could reach them. Nonetheless, on 3 August, Berwick reckoned a siege was afoot, reinforcing the garrison with 20 battalions and 7 squadrons of dragoons with horses. Lille was a heavily defended and fortified town, important to King Louis. Astutely, Berwick realized Marlborough was trying to bring his battered army to battle, despite constant missives from Versailles ordering an immediate attack. On 22 October Marshal Boufflers finally gave up and marched out to Douai. But crucially, Berwick&#x27;s army remained intact.

Berwick was Marlborough&#x27;s nephew. Long before he had become a Marshal of France, he had remained in contact with his uncle&#x27;s family when they were in exile, when the siege at Lille began. Berwick sent an equerry to purchase some horses from the Allies. Furthermore, his widowed mother married Colonel Godfrey of the English army. In 1710, the Tories won the election, sweeping away Protestant opposition to a peace with France. Berwick, encouraged by Louis XIV, planned an army to invade England. With Marlborough out of favour, France was saved the indignity of defeat.

== Later life ==
The last great event of the War of the Spanish Succession was the Duke of Berwick&#x27;s storming of Barcelona, after a long siege, on 11 September 1714. In that year, he was appointed a Knight of the Golden Fleece. Trying to explain the failure of the Jacobite Risings, the Old Pretender &quot;never forgave his half-brother, The Blues ex-colonel, Berwick, now an experienced and competent commander, for declining to lead his forces&quot;. Soon afterwards, Berwick was appointed military governor of the province of Guienne, where he became friendly with Montesquieu. In December 1718 he led an army to Spain, against Philip V, in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, bombarding San Sebastián and occupying the districts of Gipuzkoa and Biscay. Many years of peace followed this campaign that ended the following March. The King of Spain sued for peace in January 1720 and Berwick was not called to serve again in the field until 1733. In that year he was chosen to lead the Army of the Rhine in the War of the Polish Succession, successfully besieging Kehl in 1733. A year later he was decapitated by a cannonball at the Siege of Philippsburg, on 12 June 1734.

==Marriages and children==
Berwick had children by both his marriages. His descendants were the French Ducs de Fitz-James and the Spanish Duques de Liria and later the Dukes of Alba.

Berwick fell in love with General Patrick Sarsfield&#x27;s 19-year-old pregnant widow. They married in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) on 26 March 1695, two years after Sarsfield&#x27;s death in the Battle of Landen on 29 July 1693. This was Honora, Countess of Lucan (formerly known as Lady Honora Burke or Lady Honora de Burgh; b. Portumna Castle, Co. Galway, c. 1675 – d. Pézenas, 16 January 1698), the daughter of William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde, an Anglo-Irish peer. Berwick raised Sarsfield&#x27;s son, James Sarsfield, 2nd Earl of Lucan, who died childless in 1718, as his own. Berwick and the Countess had a son:

# James Francis Fitz-James Stuart, who inherited the title Duke of Berwick on his father&#x27;s death, or Jacobo Francisco Fitz-James Stuart, 2nd Duke of Berwick, 2nd Duke of Liria and Xerica (Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Yvelines, 21 October 1696 – Naples, Italy, 2 June 1738). He married Catalina Ventura Colón de Portugal, Duchess of Veragua and Duchess of La Vega, a descendant of Christopher Columbus.

After Honora Burke&#x27;s death just three years later in 1698, Berwick married Anne Bulkeley (d. 12 June 1751), daughter of Henry Bulkeley (Master of the Household to James II), in Paris on 18 April 1700. They had eight sons and five daughters: These included Charles de Fitz-James, the 4th Duke of Fitz-James.

<text>Joseph Cardinal Fesch, Prince of the Empire (3 January 1763 – 13 May 1839) was a French priest and diplomat, who was the maternal half-uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte (half-brother of Napoleon&#x27;s mother Laetitia). In the wake of his nephew, he became Archbishop of Lyon and cardinal. He was also one of the most famous art collectors of his period, remembered for having established the Musée Fesch in Ajaccio, which remains one of the most important Napoleonic collections of art.

Born in Corsica, he was the son of Swiss-born Franz Faesch and Angela Maria Pietrasanta, and belonged on his father&#x27;s side to the Faesch family, one of the most prominent patrician families of Basel. He rose to great prominence in France following Napoleon&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état of 1799. Fesch became Archbishop of Lyon in 1802, a Cardinal in 1803, Ambassador to the Holy See in 1804, a French senator and count in 1805, Grand Almoner of France in 1805, a sovereign prince in 1806, Prince of the Empire (&quot;French Prince&quot;) in 1807 (a dignity he shared only with Napoleon&#x27;s siblings, brother-in-law Joachim Murat, and adopted son Eugène de Beauharnais), and Peer of France in 1815, and was named a Prince of the Papal States by the Pope. He was a member of the Imperial House, and was included in the order of succession to the French imperial throne in accordance with the French constitution of 1804 (Title III, Article 9, &quot;The Imperial Family&quot;).

He was Napoleon&#x27;s most important diplomat in regard to Pope Pius VII, but Napoleon&#x27;s relationship with his uncle deteriorated as his relationship with the Pope soured. Nevertheless, Napoleon remained loyal to his uncle. Fesch wed his nephew to Joséphine de Beauharnais in Paris in 1804, the day before Bonaparte was crowned as Emperor of the French, in 1810 he wed Napoleon to Marie Louise of Austria, and in 1811 baptized the Emperor&#x27;s son Napoleon II.

After the end of the French Empire in 1815, he was banished from France in 1815, like the rest of the Imperial House. He relocated to Rome with his half-sister Laetitia, and took up residence at the Palazzo Falconieri, dedicating himself to art and to beneficence.

==Biography==
Fesch was born at Ajaccio in Corsica. His father was Franz Faesch, a Swiss officer in the service of the Republic of Genoa, whose family belonged to the Basel patriciate and had been ennobled in the Holy Roman Empire in 1562. Holy Roman Empire, and his mother was &quot;Nobile&quot; Angela Maria Pietrasanta. His mother had previously been married to Captain Giovanni Geronimo Ramolino, and he had an elder half-sister, Letizia Ramolino, later the mother of Napoleon. With support of Luciano Buonaparte (1718–1791), archdeacon of Ajaccio, he entered the seminary at Aix-en-Provence in 1781. He was ordained as a priest in 1785, and 24 years old, he became himself the archdeacon of Ajaccio. After the 1791 death of Luciano Buonaparte, he became for a time the protector and patron of his sister&#x27;s family. In 1789, when the French Revolution broke out, he felt, like the majority of the Corsicans, repugnance for many of the acts of the French government during that period; in particular he protested against the application to Corsica of the act known as the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (July 1790). As provost of the &quot;chapter&quot; in that city he directly felt the pressure of events; for on the suppression of religious orders and corporations, he was constrained to retire into private life.

Thereafter he shared the fortunes of the Bonaparte family in the intrigues and strifes which ensued. Drawn gradually into espousing the French cause against Pasquale Paoli and the Anglophiles, he was forced to leave Corsica and to proceed with Laetitia and her son to Toulon, in early autumn, 1793. Failing to find clerical duties at that time (the Reign of Terror), he took several posts in civil life, until on the appointment of Napoleon Bonaparte to the command of the French &quot;Army of Italy&quot; he became a commissary attached to that army. This part of his career is obscure, but his fortunes rose rapidly when Napoleon became First Consul, after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Brumaire (November 1799). When the restoration of the Roman Catholic religion was in the mind of the First Consul, Fesch resumed his clerical vocation and took an active part in the complex negotiations which led to the signing of the Concordat with the Holy See on 15 July 1801. His reward came in being made Archbishop of Lyon in August 1802. Six months later he received a further reward for his past services, being raised to the dignity of cardinal.

Appointed by Napoleon on 4 April 1803 to succeed François Cacault on the latter&#x27;s retirement from the position of French ambassador at Rome, Fesch was assisted by Chateaubriand, but soon sharply differed with him on many questions. Towards the close of 1804, Napoleon entrusted to Fesch the difficult task of securing the presence of Pope Pius VII at the forthcoming coronation of the emperor at Notre Dame, Paris (2 December 1804). His tact in overcoming the reluctance of the pope (it was only eight months after the execution of the duc d&#x27;Enghien) received further recognition. He received the &quot;grand cordon&quot; of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur, became grand-almoner of the empire and had a seat in the French senate. He was to receive further honours. In 1806 one of the most influential of the German clerics, Karl von Dalberg, then prince-bishop of Regensburg, chose him to be his coadjutor and designated him as his successor.

Subsequent events damaged his prospects. In the course of the years 1806-1807 Napoleon came into sharp collision with the pope on various matters both political and religious. Fesch sought in vain to reconcile them. Napoleon was inexorable in his demands, and Pius VII refused to give way where the discipline and vital interests of the church seemed to be threatened. The emperor several times rebuked Fesch for what he thought to be weakness and ingratitude. It is clear, however, that the cardinal went as far as possible in counselling the submission of the spiritual to the civil power. For a time he was not on speaking terms with the pope; and Napoleon recalled him from Rome.

Affairs came to a crisis in the year 1809, when Napoleon issued at Vienna the decree of 17 May, ordering the annexation of the Papal States to the French empire. In that year Napoleon conferred on Fesch the archbishopric of Paris, but he refused the honour. Fesch did however consent to take part in an ecclesiastical commission formed by the emperor from among the dignitaries of the Gallican Church, but in 1810 the commission was dissolved. The hopes of Fesch with respect to Regensburg were also damped by an arrangement of the year 1810 whereby Regensburg was absorbed in Bavaria.
In the year 1811 the emperor convoked a national council of Gallican clerics for the discussion of church affairs, and Fesch was appointed to preside over their deliberations. Here again, however, he failed to satisfy the inflexible emperor and was dismissed to his diocese. The friction between uncle and nephew became more acute in the following year. In June 1812 Pius VII was brought from his first place of detention, Savona, to Fontainebleau, where he was kept under surveillance in the hope that he would give way in certain matters relating to the Concordat and in other clerical affairs. Fesch ventured to write to the aged pontiff a letter which came into the hands of the emperor. His anger against Fesch was such that he stopped the sum of 150,000 florins which had been accorded to him.

The disasters of the years 1812-1813 brought Napoleon to treat Pius VII more leniently and the position of Fesch thus became for a time less difficult. However, on the first abdication of Napoleon (11 April 1814) and the restoration of the Bourbons, he retired to Rome where he received a welcome. The events of the Hundred Days (March–June 1815) brought him back to France; he resumed his archiepiscopal duties at Lyon and was further named a member of the senate and a peer of France. On the second abdication of the emperor (22 June 1815), Fesch retired to Rome along with his older sister Letizia. There he spent the rest of his days in dignified ease, surrounded by numerous masterpieces of art, many of which he bequeathed to the cities of Lyon and Ajaccio. He died in Rome in 1839.

==Coat of arms==
As a member of the imperial family of France, he was given a new coat of arms based on the imperial coat of arms of France (cf. House of Bonaparte). The Faesch family traditionally used a different coat of arms.

==Paintings owned by Fesch==
The Fesch collection included almost 16,000 paintings (not all at the same time). The core was Italian works of the Renaissance to the 18th century, but Fesch also had a number of Dutch Golden Age paintings and contemporary French works, as well as a number of classical sculptures. Fesch was a fairly early collector of Quattrocento paintings, or &quot;Italian Primitives&quot;. The Musée Fesch, Ajaccio contains much of Fesch&#x27;s collection, including works by Botticelli, Giovanni Bellini, Titian and others. Some of his collection is contained in the Hôtel de Ville in Ajaccio. Another part, including the works considered most important, was sold by auction in 1845.

<text>Bernardo Pasquini (7 December 163721 November 1710) was an Italian composer of operas, oratorios, cantatas and keyboard music. A renowned virtuoso keyboard player, he was one of the most important Italian composers for harpsichord between Girolamo Frescobaldi and Domenico Scarlatti, having also made substantial contributions to opera and oratorio.

==Biography==

Pasquini was born in Massa in Valdinievole (today Massa e Cozzile, in the province of Pistoia, Tuscany). He was a pupil of Mariotto Bocciantini in Uzzano (Pistoia). When he was 13, he moved to Ferrara with his uncle Giovanni Pasquini, where, at the age of 16, he would become the organist of Accademia della Morte and serve from 1653 to 1655, a prestigious post that would later serve as a launching pad for his successors.

He was quickly drawn to Rome, and, in 1657, he was appointed as the organist of Santa Maria in Vallicella (Chiesa nuova). In February 1664 he was appointed organist of the basilicas of Santa Maria Maggiore and Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. Finally, after ten years in Rome, in November 1667 he entered into a long period of service of the Borghese family, enjoying the patronage of Prince Giovanni Battista Borghese, and, from May 1693, his son and successor, Prince Marcantonio Borghese.

As a composer and keyboard player, Pasquini collaborated on music performances for a host of famous patrons in Rome, such as cardinals Flavio Chigi, Benedetto Pamphili, and the politically savvy Pietro Ottoboni.

Christina, Queen of Sweden played an important role in his career, and it was in her honour that his operas &quot;L&#x27;Alcasta&quot; (libretto by Giovanni Filippo Apolloni), and &quot;Il Lisimaco&quot; (libretto by Giacomo Sinibaldi) were performed respectively in 1673 and 1681. His first opera for Queen Christina focused on the theme of just feminine revenge, and included an incredibly ornate dedication which compared the Queen to Alexander the Great.

From 1671 until 1692, Pasquini wrote &quot;no fewer than 16 operas, 15 oratorios and about 70 cantatas.&quot; He composed numerous operas, all staged in Rome between 1672 and 1692, and which were performed again or excerpted in shows at several Italian theatres (Florence, Pisa, Naples, Ferrara, Perugia, Genoa, Rimini etc.).

Pasquini was a renowned teacher of harpsichord. Among his pupils were Tommaso Bernardo Gaffi and his nephew Felice Bernardo Ricordati. Many important musicians of the late 1600s and early 1700s had lessons from him including Georg Muffat, who praised Pasquini for having taught him &quot;the Italian way of playing the organ and harpsichord.&quot; Pasquini taught many other notable musicians of the era, including Johann Philipp Krieger, Giuseppe Fabbrini, Floriano Arresti, Johann Georg Christian Störl, and Franz Jakob Horneck, and probably also Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Carlo Domenico Draghi.

Together with Arcangelo Corelli and Alessandro Scarlatti, in 1706 Pasquini became a member of the Academy of Arcadia. He is frequently paired with Scarlatti in discussions of keyboard technique and compositional style.

Pasquini died in Rome on 21 November 1710, and was buried in his parish church of San Lorenzo in Lucina. A sepulchral monument, still existing in the church, was erected by his nephew Ricordati and the pupil Gaffi.

His keyboard music is almost entirely preserved in four manuscript volumes (partially autographs), which were compiled between circa 1691 and 1708, by the composer and other collaborators, now preserved in the Berlin State Library (Landsberg 215), and the British Library, London (Add. 31501/I–II–III).

One of his harpsichord pieces was transcribed for orchestra by Ottorino Respighi for his suite &quot;Gli uccelli.&quot;

Pasquini composed around sixty cantatas, mainly for one voice and continuo, but also for two or three voices, with or without instruments, and continuo.

He celebrated the ubiquitous cuckoo in &quot;Toccata con lo Scherzo del Cucco&quot;, written in florid style in 1702. It is perhaps the best keyboard cuckoo piece in existence for it imitates the cuckoo&#x27;s notes, which seems to have been a favourite device in early baroque music.

In 2016, , a scholar from the University of L&#x27;Aquila, lamented the tendency among musicologists and music histories to label Pasquini merely as an exponent of keyboard music, without attention to his substantial output of oratorios and opera.

<doc id="214094" wikidata="Q311625" url="?curid=214094" title="Francesco Geminiani">
<text>Francesco Xaverio Geminiani (baptised 5 December 1687 – 17 September 1762) was an Italian violinist, composer, and music theorist. BBC Radio 3 once described him as &quot;now largely forgotten, but in his time considered almost a musical god, deemed to be the equal of Handel and Corelli&quot;.

==Life==

Born in Lucca, he received lessons in music from Alessandro Scarlatti, and studied the violin under Carlo Ambrogio Lonati in Milan and afterwards under Arcangelo Corelli. From 1707 he took the place of his father in the Cappella Palatina of Lucca. From 1711, he led the opera orchestra at Naples, as Leader of the Opera Orchestra and concertmaster, which gave him many opportunities for contact with Alessandro Scarlatti. After a brief return to Lucca, in 1714, he set off for London in the company of Francesco Barsanti, where he arrived with the reputation of a virtuoso violinist, and soon attracted attention and patrons, including William Capel, 3rd Earl of Essex, who remained a consistent patron. In 1715 Geminiani played his violin concerti for the court of George I, with Handel at the keyboard. In the mid-1720s he became a freemason in London, notably as a leading member of the short-lived lodge Philo-Musicae et Architecturae Societas (1725–27) at the Queen&#x27;s Head Tavern on Fleet Street. He seems to have retained his masonic connections thereafter. On 1 February 1725, he joined the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Head&quot; lodge in London, becoming the first Italian to be in initiated in the Freemasonry. On 12 May 1725, he became Fellowcraft and Master Mason on the same day. On 11 May 1728, the Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England James King 4th Baron of Kingstone designated the brothers Geminiani for constituting in Naples the first Italian regular masonic Lodge, directly affiliated to the English Freemasonry.

Geminiani made a living by teaching and writing music, and tried to keep pace with his passion for collecting by dealing in art, but not always successfully. Many of his students went on to have successful careers, such as Charles Avison, Matthew Dubourg, Michael Christian Festing, Bernhard Joachim Hagen and Cecilia Young. 

After visiting Paris and living there for some time, he returned to England in 1755. In 1761, on one of his sojourns in Dublin, a servant robbed him of a musical manuscript on which he had bestowed much time and labour. His vexation at this loss is said to have hastened his death. He died and was buried in Dublin, but his remains were later reburied in the city of his birth, in the church of San Francesco, Lucca.

He appears to have been a first-rate violinist. Tartini reportedly called him &quot;Il Furibondo&quot;, the Madman, because of his expressive rhythms.

==Works==

Geminiani&#x27;s best-known compositions are three sets of &quot;concerti grossi&quot;; his Opus 2 (1732), Opus 3 (1733) and Opus 7 (1746) (there are 42 concerti in all) which introduce the viola as a member of the &quot;concertino&quot; group of soloists, making them essentially concerti for string quartet. These works are deeply contrapuntal to please a London audience still in love with Corelli, compared to the &quot;galant&quot; work that was fashionable on the Continent at the time of their composition. Geminiani also reworked his teacher Corelli&#x27;s Opp. 1, 3 and 5 into &quot;concerti grossi&quot;.

Geminiani&#x27;s significance today is largely due to his 1751 treatise &quot;Art of Playing on the Violin&quot; Op. 9, published in London, which is the best-known summation of the 18th-century Italian method of violin playing and is an invaluable source for the study of late Baroque performance practice. The book is in the form of 24 exercises accompanied by a relatively short but extremely informative section of the text, giving detailed instructions on articulation, trills and other ornaments, shifting between positions, and other aspects of left- and right-hand violin technique. The instructions in this treatise are famously opposed to those expressed by Leopold Mozart in his &quot;Treatise on the Fundamental Principles of Violin Playing&quot; (1756) on several issues, including on bow hold, use of vibrato, and the so-called &quot;rule of the down-bow&quot;, which states that the first beat of every bar must be played with a down-stroke.

His &quot;Guida harmonica&quot; (c. 1752, with an addendum in 1756) is one of the most unusual harmony treatises of the late Baroque, serving as a sort of encyclopedia of basso continuo patterns and realizations. There are 2,236 patterns in all, and at the end of each pattern is a page number reference for a potential next pattern; thus a student composer studying the book would have an idea of all the subsequent possibilities available after any given short bass line.

Geminiani also published a number of solos for the violin, three sets of violin concerti, twelve violin trios, the &quot;Art of Accompaniment on the Harpsichord, Organ, etc.&quot; (1754), &quot;Lessons for the Harpsichord&quot;, &quot;Art of Playing on the Guitar or Cittra&quot; (1760) and some other works.

==Criticism==
Geminiani&#x27;s compositions are noted for their imagination, expression, and warmth, but also for their lack of discipline and for under-development. Charles Burney took Geminiani to task for irregular melodic structure. Hawkins, on the other hand, was of the opinion that Geminiani&#x27;s approach represented an important advance in composition. &quot;That we are at this time in a state of emancipation from the bondage of laws imposed without authority, is owing to a new investigation of the principles of harmony, and the studies of a class of musicians, of whom Geminiani seems to have been the chief... It is observable upon the works of Geminiani, that his modulations are not only original, but that his harmonies consist of such combinations as were never introduced into music till his time. The rules of transition from one key to another, which are laid down by those who have written on the composition of music, he not only disregarded, but objected to as an unnecessary restraint on the powers of invention. He has been frequently heard to say, that the cadences in the fifth, the third, and the sixth of the key which occur in the works of Corelli, were rendered too familiar to the ear by the frequent repetition of them. And it seems to have been the study of his life, by a liberal use of the semitonic intervals, to increase the number of harmonic combinations; and into melody to introduce a greater variety than it was otherwise capable of.&quot;

<doc id="214096" wikidata="Q1054449" url="?curid=214096" title="Active optics">
<text>Active optics is a technology used with reflecting telescopes developed in the 1980s, which actively shapes a telescope&#x27;s mirrors to prevent deformation due to external influences such as wind, temperature, and mechanical stress. Without active optics, the construction of 8 metre class telescopes is not possible, nor would telescopes with segmented mirrors be feasible.

This method is used by, among others, the Nordic Optical Telescope, the New Technology Telescope, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the Keck telescopes, as well as all of the largest telescopes built since the mid-1990s.

Active optics is not to be confused with adaptive optics, which operates at a shorter timescale and corrects atmospheric distortions.

== In astronomy ==
Most modern telescopes are reflectors, with the primary element being a very large mirror. Historically, primary mirrors were quite thick in order to maintain the correct surface figure in spite of forces tending to deform it, like wind and the mirror&#x27;s own weight. This limited their maximum diameter to 5 or 6 metres (200 or 230 inches), such as Palomar Observatory&#x27;s Hale Telescope.

A new generation of telescopes built since the 1980s uses thin, lighter weight mirrors instead. They are too thin to maintain themselves rigidly in the correct shape, so an array of actuators is attached to the rear side of the mirror. The actuators apply variable forces to the mirror body to keep the reflecting surface in the correct shape over repositioning. The telescope may also be segmented into multiple smaller mirrors, which reduce the sagging due to weight that occurs for large, monolithic mirrors.

The combination of actuators, an image quality detector, and a computer to control the actuators to obtain the best possible image, is called &quot;active optics&quot;.

The name &quot;active&quot; optics means that the system keeps a mirror (usually the primary) in its optimal shape against environmental forces such as wind, sag, thermal expansion, and telescope axis deformation. Active optics compensate for distorting forces that change relatively slowly, roughly on timescales of seconds. The telescope is therefore &quot;actively&quot; still, in its optimal shape.

=== Comparison with adaptive optics ===

Active optics should not be confused with adaptive optics, which operates on a much shorter timescale to compensate for atmospheric effects, rather than for mirror deformation. The influences that active optics compensate (temperature, gravity) are intrinsically slower (1 Hz) and have a larger amplitude in aberration. Adaptive optics on the other hand corrects for atmospheric distortions that affect the image at 100–1000 Hz (the Greenwood frequency,
depending on wavelength and weather conditions). These corrections need to be much faster, but also have smaller amplitude. Because of this, adaptive optics uses smaller corrective mirrors. This used to be a separate mirror not integrated in the telescope&#x27;s light path, but nowadays this can be the second, third or fourth mirror in a telescope.

== Other applications ==
Complicated laser set-ups and interferometers can also be actively stabilized.

A small part of the beam leaks through beam steering mirrors and a four-quadrant-diode is used to measure the position of a laser beam and another in the focal plane behind a lens is used to measure the direction. The system can be sped up or made more noise-immune by using a PID controller. For pulsed lasers the controller should be locked to the repetition rate. A continuous (non-pulsed) pilot beam can be used to allow for up to 10 kHz bandwidth of stabilization (against vibrations, air turbulence, and acoustic noise) for low repetition rate lasers.

Sometimes Fabry–Pérot interferometers have to be adjusted in length to pass a given wavelength. Therefore, the reflected light is extracted by means of a Faraday rotator and a polarizer. Small changes of the incident wavelength generated by an acousto-optic modulator or interference with a fraction of the incoming radiation delivers the information whether the Fabry Perot is too long or too short.
Long optical cavities are very sensitive to the mirror alignment. A control circuit can be used to peak power. One possibility is to perform small rotations with one end mirror. If this rotation is about the optimum position, no power oscillation occurs. Any beam pointing oscillation can be removed using the beam steering mechanism mentioned above.

X-ray active optics, using actively deformable grazing incidence mirrors, are also being investigated.

<doc id="214102" wikidata="Q2913798" url="?curid=214102" title="Spherical aberration">
<text>In optics, spherical aberration (SA) is a type of aberration found in optical systems that have elements with spherical surfaces. This phenomenon commonly affects lenses and curved mirrors, as these components are often shaped in a spherical manner for ease of manufacturing. Light rays that strike a spherical surface off-centre are refracted or reflected more or less than those that strike close to the centre. This deviation reduces the quality of images produced by optical systems. The effect of spherical aberration was first identified in the 11th century by Ibn al-Haytham who discussed it in his work Kitāb al-Manāẓir.

==Overview==
A spherical lens has an aplanatic point (i.e., no spherical aberration) only at a lateral distance from the optical axis that equals the radius of the spherical surface divided by the index of refraction of the lens material. 

Spherical aberration makes the focus of telescopes and other instruments less than ideal. This is an important effect, because spherical shapes are much easier to produce than aspherical ones. In many cases, it is cheaper to use multiple spherical elements to compensate for spherical aberration than it is to use a single aspheric lens.

&quot;Positive&quot; spherical aberration means rays near the outer edge of a lens are bent more than would be predicted for an ideal lens. &quot;Negative&quot; spherical aberration means such rays are bent less than would be predicted.

The effect is proportional to the fourth power of the diameter and inversely proportional to the third power of the focal length, so it is much more pronounced at short focal ratios, i.e., &quot;fast&quot; lenses.

==Correction==
In lens systems, aberrations can be minimized using combinations of convex and concave lenses, or by using aspheric lenses or aplanatic lenses. 

Lens systems with aberration correction are usually designed by numerical ray tracing. For simple designs, one can sometimes analytically calculate parameters that minimize spherical aberration. For example, in a design consisting of a single lens with spherical surfaces and a given object distance &quot;o&quot;, image distance &quot;i&quot;, and refractive index &quot;n&quot;, one can minimize spherical aberration by adjusting the radii of curvature formula_1 and formula_2 of the front and back surfaces of the lens such that
:formula_3, where the signs of the radii follow the Cartesian sign convention.
For small telescopes using spherical mirrors with focal ratios shorter than , light from a distant point source (such as a star) is not all focused at the same point. Particularly, light striking the inner part of the mirror focuses farther from the mirror than light striking the outer part. As a result, the image cannot be focused as sharply as if the aberration were not present. Because of spherical aberration, telescopes with focal ratio less than are usually made with non-spherical mirrors or with correcting lenses.

Spherical aberration can be eliminated by making lenses with an aspheric surface. Descartes showed that lenses whose surfaces are well-chosen Cartesian ovals (revolved around the central symmetry axis) can perfectly image light from a point on the axis or from infinity in the direction of the axis. Such a design yields completely aberration-free focusing of light from a distant source.

In 2018, Rafael G. González-Acuña and Héctor A. Chaparro-Romo, graduate students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Mexico, found a closed formula for a lens surface that eliminates spherical aberration. Their equation can be applied to specify a shape for one surface of a lens, where the other surface has any given shape.

==Estimation of the aberrated spot diameter==
Many ways to estimate the diameter of the focused spot due to spherical aberration are based on ray optics. Ray optics, however, does not consider that light is an electromagnetic wave. Therefore, the results can be wrong due to interference effects arisen from the wave nature of light.

===Coddington notation===
A rather simple formalism based on ray optics, which holds for thin lenses only, is the Coddington notation. In the following, &quot;n&quot; is the lens&#x27; refractive index, &quot;o&quot; is the object distance, &quot;i&quot; is the image distance, &quot;h&quot; is the distance from the optical axis at which the outermost ray enters the lens, formula_1 is the first lens radius, formula_2 is the second lens radius, and &quot;f&quot; is the lens&#x27; focal length. The distance &quot;h&quot; can be understood as half of the clear aperture.

By using the Coddington factors for shape, &quot;s&quot;, and position, &quot;p&quot;,

: formula_6

one can write the longitudinal spherical aberration as 

:formula_7

If the focal length &quot;f&quot; is very much larger than the longitudinal spherical aberration LSA, then the transverse spherical aberration, TSA, which corresponds to the diameter of the focal spot, is given by

:formula_8

<text>Niccolò Jommelli (; 10 September 1714 – 25 August 1774) was an Italian composer of the Neapolitan School. Along with other composers mainly in the Holy Roman Empire and France, he was responsible for certain operatic reforms including reducing ornateness of style and the primacy of star singers somewhat.

==Biographical information==
===Early life===
Jommelli was born to Francesco Antonio Jommelli and Margarita Cristiano in Aversa, a town some north of Naples. He had one brother, Ignazio, who became a Dominican friar and was of some help to him in his elder years, and three sisters. His father was a prosperous linen merchant, who entrusted him for musical instruction to Canon Muzzillo, the director of the choir of Aversa Cathedral. 

When this proved successful, he was enrolled in 1725 at the Conservatorio di Santo Onofrio a Capuana in Naples, where he studied under Ignazio Prota alongside Tomaso Prota and Francesco Feo. Three years later he was transferred to the Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini, where he was trained under Niccolò Fago, with Don Giacomo Sarcuni and Andrea Basso, as second maestri (&quot;maestri di canto&quot;), or singing teachers. He was greatly influenced by Johann Adolf Hasse, who was in Naples during this period. After completing his studies he began work, and wrote two opere buffe, &quot;L&#x27;errore amoroso&quot; in early 1737 and &quot;Odoardo&quot; in late 1738. His first opera seria, &quot;Ricimero re di Goti&quot;, was such a success in Rome in 1740 that he immediately received a commission from Henry Benedict Stuart, the Cardinal-Duke of York.

When still studying at the conservatory, Jommelli was impressed with Hasse&#x27;s use of &quot;obbligato&quot; recitative to increase the tension at certain dramatic moments in his operas. Speaking of obbligato recitative for &quot;Ricimero&quot;, Charles de Brosses says that Jommelli&#x27;s use of &quot;obbligato&quot; recitative was better than anything he had heard in France.

===First operas===
His first opera, the comedy &quot;L&#x27;errore amoroso&quot;, was presented, with great success, under the protection of the Marquis del Vasto, Giovanni Battista d&#x27;Avalos, in the winter of 1737 at the Teatro Nuovo of Naples. It was followed the next year by a second comic opera, &quot;Odoardo&quot;, in the Teatro dei Fiorentini. His first serious opera &quot;Ricimero rè de&#x27; Goti&quot;, presented in the Roman Teatro Argentina in January 1740, brought him to the attention and then the protection of the Duke of York, Henry Benedict. The duke would later be raised to the rank of cardinal and procure Jommelli an appointment at the Vatican. During the 1740s, Jommelli wrote operas for many Italian cities: Bologna, Venice, Turin, Padua, Ferrara, Lucca, Parma, Naples and Rome.

===Studies with Padre Martini===
When in Bologna in 1741 for the production of his &quot;Ezio&quot;, Jommelli (in a situation blurred by anecdotes) met Padre Martini. Saverio Mattei said that Jommelli studied with Martini, and claimed to have learned with him &quot;the art of escaping any anguish or aridity&quot;. Nonetheless, his constant travelling to produce his many operas seems to have prevented him from ever taking composition lessons on a regular basis. Moreover, his relationship with Martini was not without mutual criticism. The main result of his stay in Bologna and his association with Martini was to present to the Accademia Filarmonica of that city, as application for admission, his first known sacred composition, a five-voice fugue a cappella on the final words of the small doxology, &quot;Sicut erat&quot;. Musicologist Karl Gustav Fellerer, who examined several such works, testifies that Jommelli&#x27;s piece, though being just &quot;a rigid school work&quot;, could well rank among the best admission pieces now stored in the Bolognese Accademia Filarmonica. During the early 1740s he wrote an increasing amount of religious music, mainly oratorios, and his first liturgical piece still extant, a very simple &quot;Lætatus sum&quot; in F major dated 1743, is part of the Santini collection in Münster.

Shortly after his time in Bologna, Jommelli moved to Venice and composed &quot;Merope&quot;, which was the forerunner for French operatic style later in the century. In the years immediately after this, he wrote operas for Venice, Turin, Bologna, Ferrara and Padua, and two popular oratorios, &quot;Isacco figura del Redentore&quot; and &quot;Betulia liberata&quot;.

===Venice===
Some time around 1745, Hasse recommended Jommelli for a position as the Director of Music at the Ospedale degli Incurabili in Venice, one of that city&#x27;s colleges for female musicians. This full-time employment required him to compose sacred music (mostly settings of the Mass and the Divine Office), but the financial security it gave him also allowed him to compose several other dramatic works.

Hasse&#x27;s recommended appointment of Jommelli as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; to the Ospedale degl&#x27; Incurabili in Venice is not definitively documented. But in 1745, he did start writing religious works for the women&#x27;s choir of the church of the Incurabili, San Salvatore, as part of his obligations as chapel master along with teaching the more advanced students of the institution. There are no manuscripts of Jommelli&#x27;s music composed for the Incurabili, but there are many copies of different versions of several of his works that may, with some certainty, be attributed to his period as maestro there. Among the music Helmut Hochstein lists as being composed for Venice are to be found four oratorios: &quot;Isacco figura del Redentore&quot;, &quot;La Betulia liberata&quot;, &quot;Joas&quot; and &quot;Juda proditor&quot;; some numbers in a collection of solo motets called &quot;Modulamina Sacra&quot;; one Missa breve in F major with a Credo in D major, probably a second Mass in G major, one Te Deum and five psalms.

Although two of his earliest biographers, Mattei and Villarosa, give 1748 as the year when Jommelli gave up his employment in Venice, his last compositions for the Incurabili are from 1746. He must have left Venice at the very end of 1746 or at the beginning of the following year, because on 28 January 1747 Jommelli was staging at the Argentina theatre in Rome his first version of &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot;, and in May at San Carlo in Naples a second version of &quot;Eumene&quot;.

===Rome===
It was the need of an active chapel master for the basilica of St. Peter&#x27;s in preparing for the Jubilee festival year that brought both Jommelli and Davide Perez to Rome in 1749, a year-long commemoration celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church every fifty years, so this was an important occasion for the Roman aristocracy to show off. Jommelli was summoned by the Cardinal Duke of York, Henry Benedict, to compose for him a setting of Metastasio&#x27;s oratorio &quot;La passione di Gesù Cristo&quot; still played annually in Rome, and who presented him to Cardinal Alessandro Albani, an intimate of Pope Benedict XIV.

===Stuttgart and last years===
He subsequently visited Vienna before taking a post as Kapellmeister to Duke Karl Eugen of Württemberg in Stuttgart in 1753. This period saw some of his greatest successes, including the composition of what are regarded as some of his best works. Many were staged at the Duke&#x27;s private theatres in the Palace of Ludwigsburg, outside Stuttgart. Mozart and his father Leopold passed through Ludwigsburg in 1763 on their &quot;grand tour&quot; and met the composer. Jommelli returned to Naples in 1768, by which time &quot;opera buffa&quot; was more popular than Jommelli&#x27;s &quot;opera seria&quot;, and his last works were not so well received. He suffered a stroke in 1771 which partially paralyzed him, but continued to work until his death three years later, in Naples.

==Works==
Jommelli wrote cantatas, oratorios and other sacred works, but by far the most important part of his output were his operas, particularly his &quot;opere serie&quot; of which he composed around sixty, several with libretti by Metastasio. These tended to concentrate more on the story and drama of the opera than on flashy technical displays by the singers, as was the norm in Italian opera at that time. He wrote more ensemble numbers and choruses, and, influenced by French opera composers such as Jean-Philippe Rameau, introduced ballets into his work. He used the orchestra (particularly the wind instruments) in a much more prominent way to depict what was going on in the story, including passages for orchestra alone, rather than consigning it to merely support for the singers. From Hasse, he learned to write orchestrally accompanied recitatives rather than just &quot;secco&quot; recitatives for voice and continuo (mainly harpsichord). His reforms are sometimes regarded as equal in importance to Christoph Willibald Gluck&#x27;s.

<text>Giovanni Battista or Giambattista Martini, O.F.M. Conv. (24 April 1706 – 3 August 1784), also known as Padre Martini, was an Italian Conventual Franciscan friar, who was a leading musician, composer, and music historian of the period and a mentor to Mozart.

==Biography==
Giovanni Battista Martini was born in Bologna, in that era part of the Papal States. His father, Antonio Maria Martini, a violinist, taught him the elements of music and the violin and he later learned singing and harpsichord playing from Padre Pradieri, and counterpoint from Antonio Riccieri and Giacomo Antonio Perti. Having received his education in classics from the priests of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, he afterwards entered the novitiate of the Conventual Franciscans at their friary in Lago, at the close of which he professed religious vows and received the religious habit of the Order on 11 September 1722.

In 1725, though only nineteen years old, he received the appointment of chapel-master at the Basilica of San Francesco in Bologna, where his compositions attracted attention. He established a composition school at the invitation of amateur and professional friends, where a number of well-known musicians received their education. As a teacher, he consistently expressed his preference for the practices of the earlier Roman school of composition. Martini was a zealous collector of musical literature, and possessed an extensive musical library. Burney estimated it at 17,000 volumes; after Martini&#x27;s death a portion of it passed to the Imperial library at Vienna, the rest remaining in Bologna, now in the Museo Internazionale della Musica (ex Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale).

Most contemporary musicians spoke of Martini with admiration, and Leopold Mozart consulted him with regard to the talents of his son, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The latter went on to write the friar in very effusive terms after a visit to the city. The Abbé Vogler, however, makes reservations in his praise, condemning his philosophical principles as too much in sympathy with those of Fux, which had already been expressed by P. Vallotti. His &quot;Elogio&quot; was published by Pietro della Valle at Bologna in the same year.

In 1758 Martini was invited to teach at the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna. He died in Bologna.

Among Martini&#x27;s pupils: the Belgian André Ernest Modeste Grétry, the Bohemian Josef Mysliveček, the Ukrainian Maksym Berezovsky, his fellow Conventual Franciscan friar, Stanislao Mattei, who succeeded him as conductor of the girls choir, as well as the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Christian Bach and the famous Italian cellist Giovanni Battista Cirri.
The greater number of Martini&#x27;s mostly sacred compositions remain unprinted. The Liceo of Bologna possesses the manuscripts of two oratorios as well as three intermezzos, including L&#x27;impresario delle Isole Canarie; and a requiem, with some other pieces of church music, are now in Vienna. were published at Bologna in 1734, as also twelve &quot;Sonate d&#x27;intavolalura&quot;; six &quot;Sonate per l&#x27;organo ed il cembalo&quot; in 1747; and &quot;Duetti da camera&quot; in 1763. Martini&#x27;s most important works are his &quot;Storia della musica&quot; (Bologna, 1757–1781) and his &quot;Esemplare di contrappunto&quot; (Bologna, 1774–1775). The former, of which the three published volumes relate wholly to ancient music, and thus represent a mere fragment of the author&#x27;s vast plan, exhibits immense reading and industry, but is written in a dry and unattractive style, and is overloaded with matter which cannot be regarded as historical. At the beginning and end of each chapter occur puzzle-canons, wherein the primary part or parts alone are given, and the reader has to discover the canon that fixes the period and the interval at which the response is to enter. Some of these are exceedingly difficult, but all were solved by Luigi Cherubini.

The &quot;Esemplare&quot; is a learned and valuable work, containing an important collection of examples from the best masters of the old Italian and Spanish schools, with excellent explanatory notes. It treats chiefly of the tonalities of the plain chant, and of counterpoints constructed upon them. Besides being the author of several controversial works, Martini drew up a &quot;Dictionary of Ancient Musical Terms&quot;, which appeared in the second volume of GB Doni&#x27;s Works; he also published a treatise on &quot;The Theory of Numbers as Applied to Music&quot;. His celebrated canons, published in London, about 1800, edited by Pio Cianchettini, and his unpublished set of 303 canons, show him to have had a strong sense of musical humour.

<doc id="214109" wikidata="Q164983" url="?curid=214109" title="Gallipoli campaign">
<text>The Gallipoli campaign, the Dardanelles campaign, the Defence of Gallipoli or the Battle of Gallipoli (, or ) was a military campaign in the First World War on the Gallipoli peninsula (now Gelibolu) from 19 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The Entente powers, Britain, France and the Russian Empire, sought to weaken the Ottoman Empire, one of the Central Powers, by taking control of the Turkish straits. This would expose the Ottoman capital at Constantinople to bombardment by Entente battleships and cut it off from the Asian part of the empire. With the Ottoman Empire defeated, the Suez Canal would be safe and the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits would be open to Entente supplies to the Black Sea and warm-water ports in Russia.

In February 1915 the Entente fleet failed to force a passage through the Dardanelles. An amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula began in April 1915. In January 1916, after eight months&#x27; fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force was withdrawn. It was a costly campaign for the Entente powers and the Ottoman Empire as well as for the sponsors of the expedition, especially the First Lord of the Admiralty (1911–1915), Winston Churchill. The campaign was considered a great Ottoman victory. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated.

The campaign became the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli, as founder and president. The campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand national consciousness. The anniversary of the landings, 25 April, is known as Anzac Day, the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing Remembrance Day (Armistice Day).

==Background==
===Black Sea raid===
On 29 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman and , conducted the Black Sea raid, in which they bombarded the Russian port of Odessa and sank several ships. On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the Caucasus campaign against Russia. The British briefly bombarded forts in Gallipoli, invaded Mesopotamia and studied the possibility of forcing the Dardanelles.

===Entente strategy and the Dardanelles===

Before the Dardanelles operation was conceived, the British had planned to conduct an amphibious invasion near Alexandretta on the Mediterranean, an idea originally presented by Boghos Nubar in 1914. This plan was made by the Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Earl Kitchener, to sever the Ottoman capital from Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Alexandretta was an area with a Christian population and was the strategic centre of the Ottoman railway network, its capture would cut the empire in two. Vice Admiral Sir Richard Peirse, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, ordered Captain Frank Larkin of to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914. The and the French cruiser were also present. Kitchener was working on the plan in March 1915, the beginning of the British attempt to incite an Arab Revolt. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.

By late 1914, on the Western Front, the Franco–British counter-offensive of the First Battle of the Marne had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the First Battle of Ypres in Flanders. The war of manoeuvre had evolved into trench warfare. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary closed the overland trade routes between Britain and France in the west and Russia in the east. The White Sea in the Arctic and the Sea of Okhotsk in the Far East were icebound in winter and distant from the Eastern Front; the Baltic Sea was blockaded by the (Imperial German Navy) and the entrance to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. While the Ottomans remained neutral, supplies could be sent to Russia through the Dardanelles but prior to the Ottoman entry into the war, the straits had been closed; in November the Ottomans began to mine the waterway.
The French politician, Aristide Briand, proposed in November to attack the Ottoman Empire but this was rejected and an attempt by the British to bribe the Ottomans to join the Entente side also failed. Later that month, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles, based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength. Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships, which could not operate against the German High Seas Fleet, in a Dardanelles operation, with a small occupation force provided by the army. It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw Bulgaria and Greece into the war on the Entente side. On 2 January 1915, Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans, who were campaigning in the Caucasus. Planning began for a naval demonstration in the Dardanelles, to divert Ottoman troops from Caucasia.
===Naval operations===
On 17 February 1915, a British seaplane from flew a reconnaissance sortie over the Straits. Two days later, the first attack on the Dardanelles began when an Anglo-French flotilla, including the British dreadnought , began a long-range bombardment of Ottoman coastal artillery batteries. The British had intended to use eight aircraft from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to spot for the bombardment but only a Short Type 136, was serviceable. A period of bad weather slowed the attack but by 25 February the outer forts had been reduced and the entrance cleared of mines. Royal Marines were landed to destroy guns at Kum Kale and Seddülbahir, while the naval bombardment shifted to batteries between Kum Kale and Kephez.

Frustrated by the mobility of the Ottoman batteries, sited on the instructions of General Otto Liman von Sanders, which evaded the Entente bombardments and threatened the minesweepers sent to clear the Straits, Churchill pressed the naval commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, to increase the fleet&#x27;s efforts. Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in Istanbul within 14 days. A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed the main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. Carden, suffering from stress, was placed on the sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral John de Robeck.

===18 March 1915===

On the morning of 18 March 1915, the Entente fleet, comprising with an array of cruisers and destroyers, began the main attack against the narrowest point of the Dardanelles, where the straits are wide. Despite some damage to the Entente ships by Ottoman return fire, minesweepers were ordered along the straits. In the Ottoman official account, by 2:00 p.m. &quot;all telephone wires were cut, all communications with the forts were interrupted, some of the guns had been knocked out ... in consequence the artillery fire of the defence had slackened considerably&quot;. The struck a mine, causing her to capsize in two minutes, with just 75 survivors out of 718 men. Minesweepers, manned by civilians, retreated under Ottoman artillery fire, leaving the minefields largely intact. and struck mines and &quot;Irresistible&quot; was sunk, with most of her crew rescued; &quot;Inflexible&quot; was badly damaged and withdrawn. There was confusion during the battle about the cause of the damage; some participants blaming torpedoes. was sent to rescue &quot;Irresistible&quot; but was disabled by a shell, struck a mine and was abandoned, eventually sinking.

The French battleships and sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by the ten days before and were also damaged. The losses forced de Robeck to sound the &quot;general recall&quot; to protect what remained of his force. During the planning of the campaign, naval losses had been anticipated and mainly obsolete battleships, unfit to face the German fleet, had been sent. Some of the senior naval officers like the commander of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, Commodore Roger Keyes, felt that they had come close to victory, believing that the Ottoman guns had almost run out of ammunition but the views of de Robeck, the First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher and others prevailed. Entente attempts to force the straits using naval power were terminated, due to the losses and bad weather. Planning to capture the Ottoman defences by land, to open the way for the ships, began. Two Entente submarines tried to traverse the Dardanelles but were lost to mines and the strong currents.

==Prelude==

===Entente preparations===

After the failure of the naval attacks, troops were assembled to eliminate the Ottoman mobile artillery, which was preventing the Entente minesweepers from clearing the way for the larger vessels. Kitchener appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF). Soldiers from the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) were encamped in Egypt, undergoing training prior to being sent to France. The Australian and New Zealand troops were formed into the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), commanded by Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, comprising the volunteer 1st Australian Division and the New Zealand and Australian Division. The ANZAC troops were joined by the regular 29th Division and the Royal Naval Division. The French &quot;Corps expéditionnaire d&#x27;Orient&quot; (Orient Expeditionary Corps), initially consisting of two brigades within one division, was subsequently placed under Hamilton&#x27;s command.

Over the following month, Hamilton prepared his plan and the British and French divisions joined the Australians in Egypt. Hamilton chose to concentrate on the southern part of the Gallipoli peninsula at Cape Helles and Seddülbahir, where an unopposed landing was expected. The Entente initially discounted the fighting ability of the Ottoman soldiers. The &quot;naïveté&quot; of the Entente planners was illustrated by a leaflet that was issued to the British and Australians while they were still in Egypt,


The underestimation of Ottoman military potential stemmed from a &quot;sense of superiority&quot; among the Entente, because of the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its poor performance in Libya during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 and the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. Entente intelligence failed to adequately prepare for the campaign, in some cases relying on information gained from Egyptian travel guides. The troops for the assault were loaded on transports in the order they were to disembark, causing a long delay which meant that many troops, including the French at Mudros, were forced to detour to Alexandria to embark on the ships that would take them into battle. A five-week delay until the end of April ensued, during which the Ottomans strengthened their defences on the peninsula, although bad weather during March and April might have delayed the landings anyway, preventing supply and reinforcement. Following preparations in Egypt, Hamilton and his headquarters staff arrived at Mudros on 10 April. The ANZAC Corps departed Egypt in early April and assembled on the island of Lemnos in Greece on 12 April, where a small garrison had been established in early March and practice landings were undertaken. The British 29th Division departed for Mudros on 7 April and the Royal Naval Division rehearsed on the island of Skyros, after arriving there on 17 April. That day, the British submarine tried to run the straits but hit a submarine net, ran aground and was shelled by a Ottoman fort, killing its commander, Lieutenant Commander Theodore S. Brodie and six of his crew; the survivors were forced to surrender. The Entente fleet and British and French troops assembled at Mudros, ready for the landings but poor weather from 19 March grounded Entente aircraft for nine days and on 24 days only a partial programme of reconnaissance flights was possible.

===Ottoman preparations===
The Ottoman force prepared to repel a landing on either side of the Straits was the 5th Army. This force, which initially consisted of five divisions with another en route, was a conscript force, commanded by Sanders. Many of the senior officers in the 5th Army were also German. Ottoman commanders and senior German officers debated the best means of defending the peninsula. All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges. There was disagreement as to where the Entente would land and where to concentrate forces. Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and Gaba Tepe were the likely areas for landing.

Mustafa Kemal believed that the British would use their naval power to command the land from every side at the tip of the peninsula. At Gaba Tepe, the short distance to the eastern coast meant that the Entente could easily reach the Narrows, the right-angled bend in the middle of the Dardanelles. Sanders considered Besika Bay on the Asiatic coast to be the most likely invasion site, since the terrain was easier to cross and was convenient to attack the most important Ottoman batteries guarding the straits; a third of the 5th Army was assembled there. Two divisions were concentrated at Bulair at the north end of the Gallipoli peninsula, to protect supply and communication lines to the defences further down the peninsula. The 19th Division (Kemal) and the 9th Division were placed along the Aegean coast and at Cape Helles on the tip of the peninsula. Sanders kept the bulk of the Ottoman forces inland in reserve, leaving a minimum of troops guarding the coast. The 3rd Division and a cavalry brigade arrived from Istanbul in early April, bringing the front line strength of the Ottomans to which Sanders concentrated in three groups. A maximum effort to improve land and sea communications was ordered, to move reinforcements swiftly to danger points; troops moving at night to avoid Entente air reconnaissance. Sanders&#x27; strategy was opposed by Ottoman commanders, including Kemal, who believed that the defenders were too widely dispersed to defeat the invasion on the beaches. Kemal thought Sanders&#x27; classic strategy was suitable when there was strategic depth to the front but Gallipoli did not offer that. His commander Esat Passa was not forceful enough in making the objection. Sanders was certain that a rigid system of defence would fail and that the only hope of success lay in the mobility of the three groups, particularly the 19th Division near Boghali, in general reserve, ready to move to Bulair, Gaba Tepe or the Asiatic shore.
The time needed by the British to organise the landings meant that Sanders, Colonel Hans Kannengiesser and other German officers, supported by Esat Pasha (III Corps) had more time to prepare their defences. Sanders later noted, &quot;the British allowed us four good weeks of respite for all this work before their great disembarkation ... This respite just sufficed for the most indispensable measures to be taken&quot;. Roads were constructed, small boats built to carry troops and equipment across the Narrows, beaches were wired and improvised mines were constructed from torpedo warheads. Trenches and gun emplacements were dug along the beaches and troops went on route marches to avoid lethargy. Kemal, whose 19th Division was vital to the defensive scheme, observed the beaches and awaited signs of an invasion from his post at Boghali, near Maidos. The Ottomans created Ottoman Aviation Squadrons with German assistance and had four aircraft operating around Çanakkale in February, conducting reconnaissance and army co-operation sorties. From 11 April, an Ottoman aircraft made frequent flights over Mudros, keeping watch on the assembly of the British naval force and an airfield was established near Gallipoli.

==Landings==
The Entente planned to land and secure the northern shore, capture the Ottoman forts and artillery batteries for a naval force to advance through the Narrows and the Sea of Marmara towards Istanbul. Scheduled for 23 April but postponed until 25 April due to bad weather, landings were to be made at five beaches on the peninsula. The 29th Division was to land at Helles on the tip of the peninsula and then advance upon the forts at Kilitbahir. The ANZACs, with the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade spearheading the assault, were to land north of Gaba Tepe on the Aegean coast, from where they could advance across the peninsula, cut off the Ottoman troops in Kilitbahir and stop reinforcements from reaching Cape Helles. This sector of the Gallipoli Peninsula became known as ANZAC; the area held by the British and French became known as the Helles sector or Helles. The French made a diversionary landing at Kum Kale on the Asian shore before re-embarking to hold the eastern area of the Helles sector. The Royal Naval Division simulated landing preparations at Bulair and a New Zealand officer, Bernard Freyberg, swam ashore under fire to light flares to distract the defenders from the real landings; Freyberg was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

Arrangements for naval gunfire support to the landings had originally included bombarding the beaches and approaches but was changed to engagement of the ridges during the landings, with the beaches only to be shelled prior to the landings. No decision was ultimately made on the issue of close support and it was left to the initiative of ships&#x27; captains. A reluctance to approach the shore later affected the landings at &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; beach where some of the worst losses among the infantry occurred, while naval gunfire was of some assistance at &quot;S&quot;, &quot;X&quot; and ANZAC. Even then its effectiveness was limited by the initial confusion ashore, the broken terrain, thick vegetation and the lack of observation. Kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Entente employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from 3 Squadron, RNAS (Commander Charles Samson) which arrived at Tenedos at the end of March. The aircraft were unopposed by the small Ottoman air force at first and during the planning, the force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance, although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet the Entente&#x27; intelligence needs and make up for the lack of adequate maps. After the landings, Entente aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance, observed naval gunfire, reported on Ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids.

===ANZAC Cove===

Allocated the northern landing, Birdwood&#x27;s force included the 1st Australian Division (Major General William Bridges) and the New Zealand and Australian Division (Major General Sir Alexander Godley), about The force was to land and advance inland to cut the lines of communication to the Ottoman forces in the south. The 1st Australian Division would land first, with the 3rd Infantry Brigade leading as a covering force moving inland to establish positions on Gun Ridge. The 2nd Infantry Brigade was to follow and to capture the higher ground on Sari Bair. The 1st Infantry Brigade would land last as the divisional reserve. The New Zealand and Australian Division was to come ashore and form up to advance across the peninsula. The force was to assemble at night and land at dawn to surprise the defenders and on the evening of 24 April, the covering force embarked on battleships and destroyers, with the follow on forces in on transports. The troops would disembark from the transports into ships&#x27; boats and be towed close to the shore by steamboats and then row ashore.

At around 2:00 a.m., an Ottoman observer on a hill at Ariburnu saw a multitude of ships far on the horizon. Captain Faik, in charge of a company from the 27th Infantry Regiment verified it with his binoculars and immediately informed his commanding officer, Ismet Bey, at Kabatepe. By 3:00 a.m., the moon was covered and the ships were no longer visible to the Ottomans. The Ottomans were not sure if this was a real landing or a diversion. Once the intense artillery was heard, at around 6:00 a.m. the two remaining battalions of the 27th Infantry Regiment were ordered to make their way to Ariburnu urgently. Sanders had left his HQ and was at Bulair, distracted by the few Entente ships that had appeared; he had been confident that this was where the landings would take place. For two days, he remained at Bulair with the 5th Division waiting for the real landing. His absence created problems in chain of command and delays in decision making which negated his defence scheme that relied on rapid movement of troops.
At 4:00 a.m. on the morning of 25 April, the first wave of troops from the 3rd Brigade began moving towards the shore on lighters and ships&#x27; boats. The covering force landed approximately too far north, in a bay just south of Ari Burnu, due to undetected currents or a navigational error. The landing was more difficult, over ground which rose steeply from the beaches, unlike the objective to the south, which was more open. The landing site was garrisoned by only two Ottoman companies but from positions on commanding ground, the Ottomans inflicted numerous casualties on the Australians before being overcome. The broken terrain prevented a coordinated drive inland, with the Australians on unfamiliar ground and with inaccurate maps. In the maze of steep ravines, spurs and dense scrub, Australian parties that got forward quickly lost contact and were broken up into small groups. Some Australian troops reached the second ridge but fewer still reached their objectives and, having become dispersed, the covering force could provide little support to the follow-up force.

The 1st and 2nd Brigades, then the New Zealand and Australian Division, landed on the beaches around Ari Burnu but became entangled, which took time to sort out. About four hours after the landings began, the bulk of the 1st Australian Division was ashore safely and its leading elements were pushing inland. By mid-morning, Kemal had reorganised the defenders for a counter-attack on the commanding heights of Chunuk Bair and Sari Bair. The right flank of the small lodgement taken by the Australians was driven in at with most of being lost. During the afternoon and evening, the left flank was pushed back from and the Nek. By evening, Bridges and Godley recommended re-embarkation; Birdwood agreed but, after receiving advice from the navy that re-embarkation was impossible, Hamilton ordered the troops to dig in instead. The Ottoman counter-attack was eventually repulsed and the Australians established a perimeter roughly from Walker&#x27;s Ridge in the north to Shell Green in the south. ANZAC casualties on the first day numbered around killed or wounded. The failure to secure the high ground led to a tactical stalemate, with the landings contained by the defenders in a perimeter less than long.
The Australian submarine (Lieutenant Commander Henry Stoker) penetrated the Straits on the night of 24/25 April. As landings began at Cape Helles and ANZAC Cove at dawn on 25 April, &quot;AE2&quot; reached Chanak by 6:00 a.m. and torpedoed an Ottoman gunboat believed to be a Peyk-i Şevket-class cruiser then evaded a destroyer. The submarine ran aground beneath a Ottoman fort but the Ottoman gunners could not bring their guns to bear and &quot;AE2&quot; was manoeuvred free. Shortly after refloating, the periscope was sighted by a Ottoman battleship firing over the peninsula at Entente landing sites and the ship ceased fire and withdrew. &quot;AE2&quot; advanced toward the Sea of Marmara and, at , Stoker decided to rest the boat on the seabed until nightfall. At around , &quot;AE2&quot; surfaced to recharge batteries and sent a wireless report to the fleet. The landing at Cape Helles was going well but the landing at Anzac Cove was not as successful and the Anzac commander, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, contemplated the re-embarkation of his troops. The success of &quot;AE2&quot; was a consideration in Birdwood deciding to persist and reports about &quot;AE2&quot; were relayed to the soldiers ashore to improve morale. Stoker was ordered to &quot;generally run amok&quot; and, with no enemies in sight, he sailed into the Sea of Marmara, where &quot;AE2&quot; cruised for five days to give the impression of greater numbers and made several attacks against Ottoman ships, which failed because of mechanical problems with the torpedoes.

===Cape Helles===
The Helles landing was made by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The division landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named &quot;S&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot;&#x27;, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by 1/5th Gurkha Rifles and 2/10th Gurkha Rifles; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At &quot;Y&quot; Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Entente landed unopposed and advanced inland. There were only a small number of defenders in the village but, lacking orders to exploit the position, the &quot;Y&quot; Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It was as close as the Entente ever came to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.
The main landings were made at &quot;V&quot; Beach, beneath the old Seddülbahir fortress, and at &quot;W&quot; Beach, a short distance to the west on the other side of the Helles headland. The covering force of Royal Munster Fusiliers and Hampshires landed from a converted collier, , which was run aground beneath the fortress so that the troops could disembark along ramps. The Royal Dublin Fusiliers landed at &quot;V&quot; Beach and the Lancashire Fusiliers at &quot;W&quot; Beach in open boats, on a shore overlooked by dunes and obstructed with barbed wire. On both beaches, the Ottoman defenders occupied good defensive positions and inflicted many casualties on the British infantry as they landed. Troops emerging one by one from sally ports on &quot;River Clyde&quot; were shot by machine-gunners at the Seddülbahir fort and, of the first to disembark, reached the beach.

The Ottoman defenders were too few to defeat the landing but inflicted many casualties and contained the attack close to the shore. By the morning of 25 April, out of ammunition and with nothing but bayonets to meet the attackers on the slopes leading up from the beach to the heights of Chunuk Bair, the 57th Infantry Regiment received orders from Kemal: &quot;I do not order you to fight, I order you to die. In the time which passes until we die, other troops and commanders can come forward and take our places&quot;. Every man of the regiment was either killed or wounded.

At &quot;W&quot; Beach, thereafter known as Lancashire Landing, the Lancashires were able to overwhelm the defenders despite the loss of from . Six awards of the Victoria Cross were made among the Lancashires at &quot;W&quot; Beach. A further six Victoria Crosses were awarded among the infantry and sailors at the &quot;V&quot; Beach landing and three more were awarded the following day as they fought their way inland. Five squads of Ottoman infantry led by Sergeant Yahya distinguished themselves by repulsing several attacks on their hilltop position, the defenders eventually disengaging under cover of darkness. After the landings, so few men remained from the Dublin and Munster Fusiliers that they were amalgamated into The Dubsters. Only one Dubliner officer survived the landing while, of the who landed, just the Gallipoli campaign unscathed. After the landings, little was done by the Entente to exploit the situation, apart from a few limited advances inland by small groups of men. The Entente attack lost momentum and the Ottomans had time to bring up reinforcements and rally the small number of defending troops.

==Land campaign==

===Early battles===
On the afternoon of 27 April, the 19th Division, reinforced by six battalions from the 5th Division, counter-attacked the six Entente brigades at Anzac. With the support of naval gunfire, the Entente held back the Ottomans throughout the night. The following day the British were joined by French troops transferred from Kum Kale on the Asiatic shore to the right of the line near &#x27;S&#x27; Beach at Morto Bay. On 28 April, the Entente fought the First Battle of Krithia to capture the village. Hunter-Weston made a plan which proved overly complex and was poorly communicated to the commanders in the field. The troops of the 29th Division were still exhausted and unnerved by the battles for the beaches and for Seddülbahir village, which was captured after much fighting on 26 April. The Ottoman defenders stopped the Entente advance halfway between the Helles headland and Krithia around having inflicted 

As Ottoman reinforcements arrived, the possibility of a swift Entente victory on the peninsula disappeared and the fighting at Helles and Anzac became a battle of attrition. On 30 April, the Royal Naval Division (Major General Archibald Paris) landed. The same day, Kemal, believing that the Entente were on the verge of defeat, began moving troops forward through Wire Gulley, near the and Lone Pine. Eight battalions of reinforcements were dispatched from Istanbul a day later and that afternoon, Ottoman troops counter-attacked at Helles and Anzac. The Ottomans briefly broke through in the French sector but the attacks were repulsed by massed Entente machine-gun fire, which inflicted many casualties on the attackers. The following night, Birdwood ordered the New Zealand and Australian Division to attack from Russell&#x27;s Top and Quinn&#x27;s Post towards The Australian 4th Infantry Brigade (Colonel John Monash), the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and Royal Marines from the Chatham Battalion took part in the attack. Covered by a naval and artillery barrage, the troops advanced a short distance during the night but got separated in the dark. The attackers came under massed small-arms fire from their exposed left flank and were repulsed, having suffered about 
On 30 April, the submarine &quot;AE2&quot; began to rise uncontrollably and surfaced near the , then dropped precipitously below the safe diving depth, then broke the surface again at the stern. &quot;Sultanhisar&quot; immediately fired on the submarine, puncturing the pressure hull. Stoker ordered the company to abandon ship, scuttled the submarine and the crew was taken prisoner. &quot;AE2&quot;″s achievements showed that it was possible to force the Straits and soon Ottoman communications were badly disrupted by British and French submarine operations. On 27 April, (Lieutenant Commander Edward Boyle), entered the Sea of Marmara on a three-week patrol, which became one of the most successful Entente naval actions of the campaign, in which four ships were sunk, including the transport &quot;Gul Djemal&quot; which was carrying and a field battery to Gallipoli. While the quantity and value of the shipping sunk was minor, the effect on Ottoman communications and morale was significant; Boyle was awarded the Victoria Cross. Following the success of &quot;AE2&quot; and &quot;E14&quot;, the French submarine attempted the passage on 1 May but struck a mine and was lost with all hands. (Several weeks earlier another French boat, , had been lost after running aground near Nagara Point.)

===Operations: May 1915===

On 5 May, the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division was dispatched from Egypt. Believing Anzac to be secure, Hamilton moved the Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, along with field guns, to the Helles front as reserves for the Second Battle of Krithia. Involving a force of , it was the first general attack at Helles and was planned for daylight. French troops were to capture Kereves Dere and the British, Australians and New Zealanders were assigned Krithia and Achi Baba. After of artillery preparation, the assault began at mid-morning on 6 May. The British and French advanced along the Gully, Fir Tree, Krithia and Kereves spurs which were separated by deep gullies, fortified by the Ottomans. As the attackers advanced, they became separated when trying to outflank Ottoman strong points and found themselves in unfamiliar terrain. Under artillery and then machine-gun fire from Ottoman outposts that had not been spotted by British aerial reconnaissance, the attack was stopped; next day, reinforcements resumed the advance.
The attack continued on 7 May and four battalions of New Zealanders attacked up Krithia Spur on 8 May; with the 29th Division the attackers managed to reach a position just south of the village. Late in the afternoon, the Australian 2nd Brigade advanced quickly over open ground to the British front line. Amidst small arms and artillery-fire, the brigade charged towards Krithia and gained , about short of the objective, with Near Fir Tree Spur, the New Zealanders managed to get forward and link up with the Australians, although the British were held up and the French were exhausted, despite having occupied a point overlooking their objective. The attack was suspended and the Entente dug in, having failed to take Krithia or Achi Baba.

A brief period of consolidation followed; the Entente had almost run out of ammunition, particularly for the artillery and both sides consolidated their defences. The Ottomans relieved troops opposite the Australian line, which was reinforced by the Australian Light Horse operating as infantry. Sporadic fighting continued, with sniping, grenade attacks and raids, the opposing trenches separated in places by only a few metres. The Australians lost a number of officers to sniping, including the commander of the 1st Division, Major General William Bridges, who was wounded while inspecting a 1st Light Horse Regiment position near &quot;Steele&#x27;s Post&quot; and died of his injuries on the hospital ship on 18 May.

At the end of April Birdwood told GHQ MEF (General Headquarters Mediterranean Expeditionary Force) that he could not land 6,000 horses at Anzac Cove as there was no water for them. GHQ MEF was unhappy that the ANZAC force would be immobilised on the beachhead, but they would have been no use. Some of the thousands of men and horses remained on board ship for up to a month. Birdwood signalled on 17 May that 17 transports would be returning to Alexandria to offload 5,251 horses accompanied by 3,217 men. GHQ MEF insisted that some of the men remain in Alexandria to look after the horses and guard ANZACs &quot;many vehicles and mountains of baggage&quot;.

===Ottoman counter-offensive: 19 May===
On 19 May, troops launched an attack at Anzac to push the and New Zealanders back into the sea. Short of artillery and ammunition, the Ottomans intended to rely on surprise and weight of numbers but on 18 May, the crews of a flight of British aircraft spotted the Ottoman preparations. The Ottomans suffered in the attack, of which were killed; Australian and New Zealand casualties were and . The dead included a stretcher bearer, John Simpson Kirkpatrick, whose efforts to evacuate wounded men on a donkey while under fire became famous amongst the Australians at Anzac; afterwards, his story became part of the Australian narrative of the campaign. Ottoman losses were so severe that a truce was organised by Aubrey Herbert and others on 24 May, to bury the dead lying in no man&#x27;s land, which led to a camaraderie between the armies, much like the Christmas truce of 1914 on the Western Front.
A witness account from Private Victor Laidlaw of the Australian 2nd Field Ambulance described the day,

The truce was not repeated formally.
The British advantage in naval artillery diminished after the battleship was torpedoed and sunk on 13 May by the , killing 570 men out of a crew of 750, including the ship&#x27;s commander, Captain Thomas Shelford. A German submarine, , sank on 25 May and on 27 May. More British reconnaissance patrols were flown around Gallipoli and &quot;U-21&quot; was forced to leave the area but ignorant of this, the Entente withdrew most of their warships to Imbros, where they were &quot;protectively tethered&quot; between sorties, which greatly reduced Entente naval firepower, particularly in the Helles sector. The submarine (Lieutenant Commander Martin Nasmith, later awarded a Victoria Cross) passed through the Dardanelles on 18 May and sank or disabled eleven ships, including three on 23 May, before entering Constantinople Harbour, firing on a transport alongside the arsenal, sinking a gunboat and damaging the wharf.

The Ottoman forces lacked artillery ammunition and field batteries were only able to fire between early May and the first week of June. After the defeat of the counter-attack at Anzac in mid-May, the Ottoman forces ceased frontal assaults. Late in the month, the Ottomans began tunneling around Quinn&#x27;s Post in the Anzac sector and early in the morning of 29 May, despite Australian counter-mining, detonated a mine and attacked with a battalion from the 14th Regiment. The Australian 15th Battalion was forced back but counter-attacked and recaptured the ground later in the day, before being relieved by New Zealand troops. Operations at Anzac in early June returned to consolidation, minor engagements and skirmishing with grenades and sniper-fire.

===Operations: June–July 1915===
In the Helles sector, which had been extensively entrenched by both sides, the Entente attacked Krithia and Achi Baba again, in the Third Battle of Krithia on 4 June, with the 29th Division, Royal Naval Division, 42nd Division and two French divisions. The attack was repulsed and with it, the possibility of a decisive breakthrough ended; trench warfare resumed, with objectives being measured in hundreds of yards. Casualties were approximately on both sides; the British lost from and the French from . Ottoman losses were according to the &quot;Ottoman Official History&quot; and to another account.
In June, the seaplane carrier arrived and the Entente air effort increased from a squadron to No. 3 Wing RNAS. The 52nd (Lowland) Division also landed at Helles in preparation for the Battle of Gully Ravine, which began on 28 June and achieved a local success, which advanced the British line along the left (Aegean) flank of the battlefield. Sanders credited the defence to two Ottoman officers, Faik Pasa and Albay Refet. On 30 June, the French commander, Henri Gouraud who had earlier replaced Albert d&#x27;Amade, was wounded and replaced by his divisional commander, Maurice Bailloud. Between 1 and 5 July, the Ottomans counter-attacked the new British line several times but failed to regain the lost ground. Ottoman casualties for the period were estimated at On 12 July, two fresh brigades from the 52nd Division attacked at the centre of the line along Achi Baba Nullah (Bloody Valley), gained very little ground and lost out of the Royal Naval Division had and French losses were Ottoman losses were about and .

At sea, the submarine &quot;E14&quot; made two voyages into the Marmara. The third tour began on 21 July, when &quot;E14&quot; passed through the straits despite a new anti-submarine net placed near the Narrows. The next attempt was made by on 27 July, which was caught in the net, forced to the surface and bombarded by shore batteries; &quot;Mariotte&quot; was scuttled. On 8 August, &quot;E11&quot; torpedoed the battleship &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot; with the loss of and sank a gunboat, seven transports and 23 sailing vessels.

===August offensive===

The failure of the Entente to capture Krithia or make any progress on the Helles front led Hamilton to form a new plan to secure the Sari Bair Range of hills at the Battle of Sari Bair and capture high ground on in the Battle of Chunuk Bair. Both sides had been reinforced, the original five Entente divisions having been increased to fifteen and first six Ottoman divisions to sixteen. The Entente planned to land two fresh infantry divisions from IX Corps at Suvla, north of Anzac, followed by an advance on Sari Bair from the north-west. At Anzac, an offensive would be made against the Sari Bair range by advancing through rough and thinly defended terrain, north of the Anzac perimeter. This would be achieved by an attack on from the Nek by dismounted Australian light horsemen from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, in concert with an attack on Chunuk Bair summit by New Zealanders from the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, who would traverse Rhododendron Ridge, the Apex and the Farm. would be attacked by Gurkhas of the 29th Indian Brigade and the Australians of the 4th Infantry Brigade. The Entente had , mainly from 3 Wing RNAS at Imbros, which had replaced its Voisins with Farmans and Nieuport Xs; &quot;Escadrille&quot; MF98T had also been established at Tenedos. The Ottomans had , of which eight were stationed at Çanakkale. Entente aircraft made reconnaissance flights, spotted for naval guns and conducted low-level bombing of Ottoman reserves as they were brought up to the battlefield. Entente aircraft also undertook anti-shipping operations in the Gulf of Saros, where a seaplane from HMS &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot; sank an Ottoman tug with an air-launched torpedo.
The landing at Suvla Bay took place on the night of 6 August against light opposition; the British commander, Lieutenant General Frederick Stopford, had limited his early objectives and then failed to forcefully push his demands for an advance inland and little more than the beach was seized. The Ottomans were able to occupy the Anafarta Hills, preventing the British from penetrating inland, which contained the landings and reduced the Suvla front to static trench warfare. The offensive was preceded on the evening of 6 August by diversions, at Helles, where the Battle of Krithia Vineyard became another costly stalemate. At Anzac, the diversionary Battle of Lone Pine, led by the Australian 1st Infantry Brigade, captured the main Ottoman trench line and diverted Ottoman forces but the attacks at Chunuk Bair and failed.
The New Zealand Infantry Brigade came within of the near peak of Chunuk Bair by dawn on 7 August but was not able to seize the summit until the following morning. On the morning of 7 August, the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade attacked on a narrow front at the Nek, to coincide with the New Zealand attack from Chunuk Bair against the rear of the Ottoman defences. The opening artillery barrage lifted seven minutes too soon, which alerted the Ottomans and the attack was a costly failure. An attack on never took place after the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade and an Indian brigade lost direction during the night. Attempts to resume the attack were easily repulsed by the Ottoman defenders, at great cost to the Entente. The New Zealanders held out on Chunuk Bair for two days before being relieved by two New Army battalions from the Wiltshire and Loyal North Lancashire Regiments but an Ottoman counterattack on 10 August, led by Mustafa Kemal, swept them from the heights. Of in the New Zealand Wellington Battalion who reached the summit, casualties. With the Ottoman recapture of the ground, the Entente&#x27; best chance of victory was lost.

The Suvla landing was reinforced by the arrival of the 10th (Irish) Division on 7 August, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which began landing on 8 August, the 54th (East Anglian) Division arriving late on 10 August and the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division on 18 August. On 12 August, the 54th Division attacked Kavak Tepe and Tekke Tepe, crossing the Anafarta Plain. The attack failed and Hamilton briefly considered the evacuation of Suvla and Anzac.
Elements of the new Australian 2nd Division began arriving at Anzac from Egypt with the 5th Infantry Brigade landing from and the 6th Brigade and 7th Brigade arriving in early September. The 29th Division was also shifted from Helles to Suvla. The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August, in the Battle of Scimitar Hill and the Battle of Hill 60. Control of the hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts but the attacks failed. On 17 August, Hamilton had requested another but a day earlier, the French had announced plans to Kitchener for an autumn offensive in France. A meeting of the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August determined that the French offensive would be supported by a maximum effort, which left only about for the Dardanelles. On 23 August, after news of the failure at Scimitar Hill, Hamilton went onto the defensive, as the Bulgarian entry into the war, which would allow the Germans to rearm the Ottoman army, was imminent and left little opportunity for the resumption of offensive operations. On 20 September 1915, the Newfoundland Regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay with the 29th Division. On 25 September, Kitchener proposed detaching two British and one French division for service in Salonika in Greece, which was the beginning of the end of the Entente campaign at Gallipoli. Instead, a counter proposal from Sir Ian Hamilton was agreed to; only the 10th (Irish) Division and the 156th Infantry Division (France) were withdrawn from the peninsula. By the end of September these troops were concentrating at Mudros for conveyance to the new front.

Alan Moorehead wrote that during the stalemate, an old Ottoman batman was regularly permitted to hang his platoon&#x27;s washing on the barbed wire undisturbed and that there was a &quot;constant traffic&quot; of gifts being thrown across no-man&#x27;s land, dates and sweets from the Ottoman side and cans of beef and packs of cigarettes from the Entente side. Conditions at Gallipoli grew worse for everyone as summer heat and poor sanitation resulted in an explosion in the fly population. Eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and putrid. The precarious Entente lodgements were poorly situated, which caused supply and shelter problems. A dysentery epidemic spread through the Entente trenches at Anzac and Helles, while the Ottomans also suffered heavily from disease which resulted in many deaths.

===Evacuation===
After the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli campaign drifted. Ottoman success began to affect public opinion in Britain, with criticism of Hamilton&#x27;s performance being smuggled out by Keith Murdoch, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett and other reporters. Stopford and other dissident officers also contributed to the air of gloom and the possibility of evacuation was raised on 11 October 1915. Hamilton resisted the suggestion, fearing the damage to British prestige but was sacked shortly afterwards and replaced by Lieutenant General Sir Charles Monro. Autumn and winter brought relief from the heat but also led to gales, blizzards and flooding, resulting in men drowning and freezing to death, while thousands suffered frostbite. The Serbian defeat in the Serbian campaign in autumn 1915 prompted France and Britain to transfer troops from the Gallipoli campaign to Greek Macedonia; the Macedonian front was established to support the remnants of the Serbian army to conquer Vardar Macedonia.

On 4 September, the submarine was caught in the Ottoman anti-submarine net as it began another tour. Despite such reverses, by mid-September, Entente nets and mines had closed the eastern entrance to the Dardanelles to German U-boats and &quot;U-21&quot; was thwarted when it tried to pass the straits to Istanbul on 13 September. The first French submarine to enter the Sea of Marmara was but it was forced to turn back; on 30 October, when returning through the straits, it ran aground beneath a fort and was captured intact. The crew of 25 were taken prisoner and documents detailing planned Entente operations were discovered, including a scheduled rendezvous with on 6 November. The rendezvous was kept by the German U-boat instead, which torpedoed and sank &quot;E20&quot;, killing all but nine of the crew.

The situation at Gallipoli was complicated by Bulgaria joining the Central Powers. In early October 1915, the British and French opened a second Mediterranean front at Salonika, by moving two divisions from Gallipoli and reducing the flow of reinforcements. A land route between Germany and the Ottoman Empire through Bulgaria was opened and the Germans rearmed the Ottomans with heavy artillery capable of devastating Entente trenches, especially on the confined front at Anzac, modern aircraft and experienced crews. In late November, an Ottoman crew in a German Albatros C.I shot down a French aircraft over Gaba Tepe and the Austro-Hungarian and artillery units arrived, providing a substantial reinforcement of the Ottoman artillery. Monro recommended evacuation to Kitchener, who in early November visited the eastern Mediterranean. After consulting with the commanders of VIII Corps at Helles, IX Corps at Suvla and Anzac, Kitchener agreed with Monro and passed his recommendation to the British Cabinet, who confirmed the decision to evacuate in early December.

Due to the narrowness of no man&#x27;s land and the winter weather, many casualties were anticipated during the embarkation. The untenable nature of the Entente position was made apparent by a rainstorm on 26 November 1915. The downpour at Suvla lasted for three days and there was a blizzard in early December. Rain flooded trenches, drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into the lines; the following snow killed still more men from exposure. Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as William Scurry&#x27;s self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Entente departure. At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire. This incident successfully discouraged the Ottomans from inspecting when the actual evacuation occurred. A mine was detonated at the Nek, which killed soldiers. The Entente force was embarked, with the Australians suffering no casualties on the final night but large quantities of supplies and stores fell into Ottoman hands.
Helles was retained for a period but a decision to evacuate the garrison was made on 28 December. Unlike the evacuation from Anzac Cove, Ottoman forces were looking for signs of withdrawal. Having used the interval to bring up reinforcements and supplies, Sanders mounted an attack on the British at Gully Spur on 7 January 1916 with infantry and artillery but the attack was a costly failure. Mines were laid with time fuzes and that night and on the night of 7/8 January, under the cover of a naval bombardment, the British troops began to fall back from their lines to the beaches, where makeshift piers were used to board boats. The last British troops departed from Lancashire Landing around 04:00 on 8 January 1916. The Newfoundland Regiment was part of the rearguard and withdrew on 9 January 1916. Among the first to land, remnants of The Plymouth Battalion, Royal Marine Light Infantry were the last to leave the Peninsula.

Despite predictions of up to and mules, and of equipment were removed; that could not be embarked were killed so as not to fall into Ottoman hands and were left behind with smashed wheels. As at Anzac, large amounts of supplies (including 15 British and six French unserviceable artillery pieces which were destroyed), gun carriages and ammunition were left behind; hundreds of horses were slaughtered to deny them to the Ottomans. A sailor was killed by debris from a magazine that exploded prematurely and a lighter and a picket boat were lost. Shortly after dawn, the Ottomans retook Helles. In the final days of the campaign, Ottoman air defences had been increased by a German–Ottoman fighter squadron, which began operations over the peninsula and inflicted the first British flying losses a couple of days after the evacuation of Helles, when three shot down two RNAS aircraft.

==Aftermath==

===Military repercussions===

Harvey Broadbent described the campaign as &quot;a close-fought affair&quot; that was a defeat for the Entente, while Les Carlyon called it a stalemate. Peter Hart wrote that the Ottoman forces &quot;held the Entente back from their real objectives with relative ease&quot; and Philip Haythornthwaite wrote of it as a &quot;disaster for the Entente&quot;. The campaign caused &quot;enormous damage to ... [Ottoman] national resources&quot; and at that stage of the war the Entente were in a better position to replace their losses than the Ottomans but the Entente attempt at securing a passage through the Dardanelles failed. The campaign diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, but it also consumed resources the Entente could have employed on the Western Front and caused them many losses.

The Entente campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, supply and tactical deficiencies. The Entente forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage; the Ottoman commanders were able to use the high ground around the Entente landing beaches for positions that limited the ability of Entente forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches. The campaign&#x27;s necessity remains the subject of debate and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Entente should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany&#x27;s &quot;soft underbelly&quot;, its allies in the east.

British and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Entente submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Entente submarines in the region. &quot;E2&quot; left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the sea. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed, the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing many losses, dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.

Gallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and Harry Chauvel (1st Light Horse Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command. The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest. The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Entente. In Mesopotamia, the Ottomans surrounded a British expedition at Kut Al Amara, forcing their surrender in April 1916. Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt. Defeat at the Battle of Romani and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition. The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.
The lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the Normandy Landings in 1944 and during the Falklands War in 1982. The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the Pacific War and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine. In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that between the wars, the campaign &quot;became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare&quot; in Britain and United States. In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved &quot;all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal&quot;.

=== Later campaigns in WWII ===
Russell Weigley wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to &quot;a belief among most of the armed forces of the world&quot; that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in Italy, Tarawa and the Gilberts, arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944. Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome. The memory of Gallipoli weighed upon the Australians during the planning of the Huon Peninsula campaign in late 1943. In September, the Australians made their first opposed amphibious landing since Gallipoli at the Battle of Finschhafen in New Guinea. The landing was hampered by navigational errors and troops came ashore on the wrong beaches but they had been trained according to the lessons of Gallipoli and quickly reorganised to push inland.

===Political effects===

Political repercussions in Britain had begun during the battle; Fisher resigned in May after bitter conflict with Churchill. The crisis that followed after the Conservatives learned that Churchill would be staying, forced the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to end his Liberal Government and form a Coalition Government with the Conservative Party. The Asquith government responded to the disappointment and outrage over Gallipoli and Kut by establishing commissions of inquiry into both episodes, which had done much to &quot;destroy its faltering reputation for competence&quot;. The Dardanelles Commission was set up to investigate the failure of the expedition, the first report being issued in 1917, with the final report published in 1919. Following the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the MEF, was recalled to London in October 1915, ending his military career. Churchill was demoted from First Lord of the Admiralty as a condition of Conservative entry to the coalition but remained in the Cabinet in the sinecure of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Churchill resigned in November 1915 and left London for the Western Front, where he commanded an infantry battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers early in 1916.

Asquith was partly blamed for Gallipoli and other disasters and was ousted in December 1916, when David Lloyd George proposed a war council under his authority, with the Conservatives in the coalition threatening to resign unless the plan was implemented. After failure to reach agreement, Lloyd George and then Asquith resigned, followed by Lloyd George becoming prime minister. Lloyd George formed a new government, from which Churchill, active again in the House of Commons from June 1916, was excluded because of Conservative opposition. In the summer of 1917, Churchill was eventually appointed to the cabinet-level post of Minister of Munitions but not to the War Cabinet. The final report of the Commission was issued in 1919, concluding that with the forces available, success was dependent on the government giving priority to the expedition and leaving the British Expeditionary Force in France to make do. The Commissioners found that Hamilton had been over-optimistic from the beginning and had added to Stopford&#x27;s difficulties on 8 August 1915. Hamilton emerged from the investigation more favourably than perhaps was justified, partly because he made devious attempts to gain collusion from witnesses and obtain leaks from the deliberations of the Commission, Hamilton never received another army appointment.

===Casualties===

Casualty figures for the campaign vary between sources but in 2001, Edward J. Erickson wrote that in the Gallipoli Campaign over were killed, including and around and French soldiers. Using the Ottoman Archives, Erickson estimated that Ottoman casualties in the Gallipoli Campaign were died from all causes, were wounded or injured and went missing or were captured. In 2001, Les Carlyon gave figures of killed or missing, including In September 1915 Godley complained that too few of the recovered sick or wounded casualties from Gallipoli were being returned from Egypt, and General John Maxwell replied that &quot;the appetite of the Dardanelles for men has been phenomenal and wicked&quot;.

There were nearly during the campaign, with the British &quot;History of the Great War&quot; listing losses including sick as and troops (with some Turkish (sic) sources referring to Ottoman casualties have been disputed and in 2001, Tim Travers gave casualty figures of and ranks (battle and non-battle); included among this may be Liman von Sanders estimated that the Ottomans suffered casualties, including and that returned to duty.

The New Zealand semi-official history (1919, by Fred Waite) estimated that 8,556 New Zealanders served at Gallipoli and contained an estimate of battle casualties including In 2000, Ross McGibbon wrote that had been killed, about a quarter of those who had initially landed on the peninsula; other estimates were 2,701 (Pugsley) or 2,779 (Stowers). A 2019 study by the New Zealand historians John Crawford and Matthew Buck arrived at a higher estimate for the numbers of New Zealand soldiers who served at Gallipoli, over 16,000, perhaps 17,000 (rather than earlier revised figures of 13,000 to 14,000 and the 1919 figure of 8,556).

====Sickness====

Many soldiers became sick due to conditions, especially from typhoid, dysentery and diarrhoea. Cecil Aspinall-Oglander, the British official historian, reported that Empire soldiers were evacuated for illness during the campaign. A total of troops fell sick, not counting Dominion or Indian troops; of these, exclusive of those evacuated. The sick were transported from Gallipoli to hospitals in Egypt and Malta as quickly as possible as bases in the area of operations were insufficient. Approximately of men removed as non-battle casualties died, against in France and Flanders. The proportion of disease casualties to battle casualties was considerably higher in the Gallipoli campaign than it was on the campaigns of the Western Front. Aspinall-Oglander gave the number of Ottoman troops evacuated sick The largest cause of non-battle admissions to hospital for British troops was dysentery, with infected and another having diarrhoea. Other notable conditions were frostbite with gonorrhea and rheumatic fever French casualties during the campaign amounted to around 47,000. Of the French casualties, 27,169 were killed, wounded or missing with an implied 20,000 who fell sick.

Allegations were made that Entente forces had attacked or bombarded Ottoman hospitals and hospital ships on several occasions between the start of the campaign and September 1915. By July 1915, hospitals had been built with and three hospital ships were in the area. The French Government disputed these complaints through the Red Cross and the British responded that if it happened then it was accidental. Russia, in turn, claimed that the Ottomans had attacked two of their hospital ships, and &quot;Vperiod&quot;, but the Ottoman Government replied that the vessels had been the victims of mines. No chemical weapons were used at Gallipoli, although the Entente debated their use throughout the campaign and transported to the theatre quantities of gas, which was used against Ottoman troops in the Middle Eastern theatre two years later, during the Second and Third Battles of Gaza.

====Graves and memorials====
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is responsible for permanent cemeteries for all Commonwealth of Nations forces. There are 31 CWGC cemeteries on the Gallipoli peninsula: six at Helles (plus the only solitary grave, that of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Doughty-Wylie VC, Royal Welch Fusiliers), four at Suvla and For many of those killed or died on hospital ships and were buried at sea, there is no known grave; their names are recorded on one of five &quot;memorials to the missing&quot;. The Lone Pine Memorial commemorates Australians killed in the Anzac sector, as well as New Zealanders with no known grave or who were buried at sea, while the Lone Pine, Hill 60 and Chunuk Bair memorials commemorate New Zealanders killed at Anzac. The Twelve Tree Copse Memorial commemorates the New Zealanders killed in the Helles sector, while British, Indian and Australian troops who died there are commemorated on the Helles Memorial at Cape Helles. British naval casualties who were lost or buried at sea are listed on memorials in the United Kingdom.
There are three more CWGC cemeteries on the Greek island of Lemnos, the first one for the 352 Entente soldiers in Portianou, the second one for the 148 Australian and 76 New Zealand soldiers in the town of Moudros and the third one for the Ottoman soldiers (170 Egyptian and 56 Ottoman soldiers). Lemnos was the hospital base for the Entente forces and most of the buried were among the men who died of their wounds. Makeshift graves were created during the campaign, often with simple wooden crosses or markers; some graves were decorated more extensively. There is a French cemetery on the Gallipoli Peninsula, located at Seddülbahir. There are no large Ottoman/Turkish military cemeteries on the peninsula but there are numerous memorials, the main ones being the Çanakkale Martyrs&#x27; Memorial at Morto Bay, Cape Helles (near &#x27;S&#x27; Beach), the Turkish Soldier&#x27;s Memorial on Chunuk Bair and the memorial and open-air mosque for the 57th Regiment near Quinn&#x27;s Post (Bomba Sirt). There are a number of memorials and cemeteries on the Asian shore of the Dardanelles, demonstrating the greater emphasis that Turkish historians place on the victory of 18 March over the subsequent fighting on the peninsula.

===Subsequent operations===

Entente troops were withdrawn to Lemnos and then to Egypt. French forces (renamed the in late October) were subsumed into the Army of the Orient and later employed at Salonika. In Egypt, the British Imperial and Dominion troops from the Dardanelles along with fresh divisions from the United Kingdom and those at Salonika, became the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF), commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray. They joined the Force in Egypt to become the strategic reserve for the British Empire, consisting of 13 infantry and mounted divisions with . In March 1916, Murray took command of both these forces, forming them into the new Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and reorganising the units for service in Europe, Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East. While the ANZAC was disbanded, the AIF was expanded with three new Australian divisions being raised and a New Zealand Division was also formed. These units moved to the Western Front in mid-1916.
The British yeomanry units that had fought dismounted at Gallipoli were reinforced and reorganised, forming the 74th (Yeomanry) Division and a portion of the 75th Division. Along with the Australian Light Horsemen and New Zealand Mounted Rifles remounted and reorganised into the Anzac Mounted Division, infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division, 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, 53rd (Welsh) Division and 54th (East Anglian) Division, later joined by additional remounted Australian Light Horsemen and British yeomanry from the Australian Mounted Division, participated in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. The Egyptian Sinai was reoccupied in 1916, while Palestine and the northern Levant were captured from the Ottoman Empire during 1917 and 1918, before the Armistice of Mudros ended hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre on 31 October. The Entente subsequently occupied Gallipoli and Istanbul and partitioned the Ottoman Empire. The occupation ended in 1923 following the Turkish War of Independence, the Armistice of Mudanya and the Treaty of Lausanne.

==Legacy==

The significance of the Gallipoli campaign is felt strongly in both Australia and New Zealand, despite their being only a portion of the Entente forces; the campaign is regarded in both nations as a &quot;baptism of fire&quot; and had been linked to their emergence as independent states. Approximately 50,000 Australians served at Gallipoli and from 16,000 to 17,000 New Zealanders. It has been argued that the campaign proved significant in the emergence of a unique Australian identity following the war, which has been closely linked to popular conceptualisations of the qualities of the soldiers that fought during the campaign, which became embodied in the notion of an &quot;Anzac spirit&quot;.

The landing on 25 April is commemorated every year in both countries as &quot;Anzac Day&quot;. The first iteration was celebrated unofficially in 1916, at churches in Melbourne, Brisbane and London, before being officially recognised as a public holiday in all Australian states in 1923. The day also became a national holiday in New Zealand in the 1920s. Organised marches by veterans began in 1925, in the same year a service was held on the beach at Gallipoli; two years later the first official dawn service took place at the Sydney Cenotaph. During the 1980s, it became popular for Australian and New Zealand tourists to visit Gallipoli to attend the dawn service there and since then thousands have attended. Over 10,000 people attended the 75th anniversary along with political leaders from Turkey, New Zealand, Britain and Australia. Dawn services are also held in Australia; in New Zealand, dawn services are the most popular form of observance of this day. Anzac Day remains the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in Australia and New Zealand, surpassing Remembrance Day (Armistice Day).

Along with memorials and monuments established in towns and cities, many streets, public places and buildings were named after aspects of the campaign, especially in Australia and New Zealand. Some examples include Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera in Queensland, and the Canadian Armed Forces armoury in Corner Brook, Newfoundland which is named the Gallipoli Armoury. Gallipoli also had a significant impact on popular culture, including film, television and song. In 1971, Scottish-born Australian folk singer-songwriter Eric Bogle wrote a song called &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; which consisted of an account from a young Australian soldier who was maimed during the Gallipoli campaign. The song has been praised for its imagery, evoking the devastation at the Gallipoli landings. It remains widely popular and is considered by some to be an iconic anti-war song.

In Turkey, the battle is thought of as a significant event in the state&#x27;s emergence, although it is primarily remembered for the fighting that took place around the port of Çanakkale, where the Royal Navy was repulsed in March 1915. For the Turks, 18 March has a similar significance as 25 April to Australians and New Zealanders; it is not a public holiday but is commemorated with special ceremonies. The campaign&#x27;s main significance to the Turkish people lies in the role it played in the emergence of Mustafa Kemal, who became the first president of the Republic of Turkey after the war. &quot;Çanakkale geçilmez&quot; (Çanakkale is impassable) became a common phrase to express the state&#x27;s pride at repulsing the attack and the song &quot;Çanakkale içinde&quot; (&quot;A Ballad for Chanakkale&quot;) commemorates the Turkish youth who fell during the battle. Turkish filmmaker Sinan Cetin created a movie called &quot;Children of Canakkale&quot;.

<doc id="214114" wikidata="Q6233903" url="?curid=214114" title="John Francis Hylan">
<text>John Francis Hylan (April 20, 1868January 12, 1936) was the 96th Mayor of New York City (the seventh since the consolidation of the five boroughs), from 1918 to 1925. From rural beginnings in the Catskills, Hylan eventually obtained work in Brooklyn as a laborer on the elevated railroad. During his nine years with the company, he worked his way to engineer, and also studied to earn his high school diploma. He continued by earning a law degree. He practiced law for nine years, and also participated in local Democratic politics.

In 1917 with the consent of Tammany and William Randolph Hearst, he was put forward as a Brooklyn Democratic candidate for Mayor and won the first of two terms. He was re-elected with a wide plurality, which swept many Brooklyn Democrats into office. His chief focus in office was to keep subway fares from rising. By the end of his second term, however, a report by a committee appointed by Governor Al Smith severely criticized his administration&#x27;s handling of the subway system. 

Tammany ran Jimmy Walker against him for the Democratic nomination and Hylan lost. Walker appointed him to the Children&#x27;s Court where he sat for many years. After his term as mayor, Hylan spent much time attacking the &quot;interests,&quot; arguing that industrial concentration gave great power to individuals to influence politics and impoverish the working poor.

==Early life==
Hylan was born in 1868 in Hunter, New York. He was the third child, and had two older sisters and two younger brothers. Hylan&#x27;s father had emigrated from County of Cavan, Ulster, Ireland at the age of seven. He served as a corporal in the 120th New York Infantry, called the &quot;Ulster Regiment,&quot; during the Civil War. 

Hylan&#x27;s mother, who came from the Jones family upstate, had a Welsh father and a maternal grandfather, Jacob Gadron, who fought in the American Revolution among Lafayette&#x27;s forces. He fondly remembered her throughout his life and wrote that the words she spoke on leaving the family (&quot;Be honest, be truthful, be upright, and do by others as you would have them do unto you&quot;) were &quot;indelibly imprinted on&quot; his memory. Although his mother was Methodist, Hylan was raised a Catholic. His only surviving family, his sister Mary, died after being struck by an automobile on July 10, 1911.
Hylan&#x27;s family owned a 60-acre farm in the then-undeveloped mountains and struggled to make the semi-annual interest on its $1,500 mortgage. As the oldest boy, Hylan was required to work long hours on the farm, which was not equipped with much more than hand tools. Farm work came first, the school district was impoverished, and only one family could afford the required grammar or history book, which Hylan occasionally borrowed. School lasted four to five hours a day for five months a year. In his teenage years, Hylan made extra money to help pay the mortgage interest by working each spring for the Catskill railroad, digging earth and tamping it beneath the tracks to stabilize them after the effects of winter weather.

==Early career==
By the winter of 1887, when he was 19, Hylan felt he could make more money for his parents by working downstate. With $3.50 and a few sets of clothes, he set off to New York, buying a $2 train ticket and then crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. On his first day he saw construction on an elevated railroad. Although he had never seen such a thing before, he climbed onto the structure and asked the foreman for a job, saying that he had worked on the Catskill railroad. He was told to report the next day, where his job was to lay rails.

Seeking a promotion, he applied at the office of the manager of the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad each day until he was finally granted an interview and promoted to fireman. He made $1.50 a day for this heavy labor. He reported to the East New York station on March 11, 1888, the day of the Great Blizzard. After two years as stoker, then as engine hostler, Hylan passed the required test and was given a job as an engineer, in &quot;one of the happiest moments of [his] life.&quot; Making $3.50 a day, he said, &quot;finally landed [him] on the right side of the engine cab.&quot; It required long hours: 13-hour runs on weekdays, 12 hours on Saturdays, and 11 on Sundays.

When Hylan felt himself economically secure, even before he became engineer, he went back to Hunter and married his childhood sweetheart Marian O&#x27;Hara. They moved to Bushwick, a section of Brooklyn where they would spend most of the rest of their lives. During his years as a motorman, he regularly paid the $75 semiannual interest payment for his family&#x27;s farm and paid the principal off before he left that job. Hylan wrote that he had no inclination to seek any other position once he was settled and making $100 a month.

Hylan considered law because his younger brother, who had been studying law and on whom his parents had pinned hopes and family pride, had died. His wife encouraged him, but because of his limited education, he had to study at the Long Island Business College to prepare himself for his Regents exam before he could begin to study law. He got into law school with the help of his wife, as well as that of a teacher who gave up his lunch hour to help, and for whom Hylan later found a position in the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity when he became mayor.

After he passed his Regents exam, he enrolled in New York Law School where Woodrow Wilson, who was teaching Constitutional Law there at the time, was among his professors. After graduating in October 1897, Hylan clerked for Long Island City attorney James T. Olwell. He prepared himself in two and a half years. The earliest bar exam he could take was in Syracuse, but immediately before he was set to take the exam, he was involved in a near accident with the railroad&#x27;s supervisor. Hylan said that it was the supervisor&#x27;s fault, but nonetheless, he was fired. Even so, the privileges of his membership in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers enabled him to travel to Syracuse at no charge, and he passed the bar exam.

==Law and politics==

===Law career===
Hylan learned that law practices required startup cash, so he mortgaged the farm again to raise $500. With that sum, he set up an office on the corner of Gates Avenue and Broadway in Bushwick. He made $24 his first month, but gradually built up a good civil litigation practice. He soon formed a partnership with Harry C. Underhill, an attorney who had written a treatise on evidence and would go on to write on other practice topics. Underhill did the office work, while Hylan was the trial lawyer. The firm occasionally received positive local publicity, such as the time when they obtained a ruling that the Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company had to offer free transfers at all junctions. Hylan litigated small civil cases and family law matters. He had little work in the police courts and &quot;never cared for that branch of the law.&quot;
After eight years in the courts of Brooklyn, he was respected enough to begin getting appointments within the power of local judges. Hylan had higher ambitions, so he began making the kind of connections expected of someone considering a run for higher office. One connection he made, albeit by accident, was John H. McCooey, the future Brooklyn Democratic Party boss; they met when McCooey was a postal clerk and Hylan was sending money orders to his parents for interest payments on the family farm&#x27;s mortgage. Hylan would remain grateful for the kindness McCooey showed him, and they remained friends thereafter. 

Other contacts were made by constant attendance at local organizations, political and otherwise. In addition to his union membership, which he kept up even when he was mayor, he was a member of the Foresters of America, the Broadway Board of Trade, the Twenty-eighth Ward Taxpayer Association, and he began working his way up the local Democratic club.

===Politics and judgeships===

Hylan emerged from obscurity in Brooklyn Democratic politics during the citywide elections of 1903, a campaign during which several internal Democratic power struggles worked themselves out. In Manhattan Charles Francis Murphy had recently replaced Richard Croker as head of the Tammany machine. Murphy, who had become independently wealthy from a trucking company which leased docks from the city and rented them to shipping companies, fixed his goal as Tammany chief to extend Tammany influence to all the boroughs and then beyond. He decided to dislodge Fusionist mayor Seth Low by running George B. McClellan Jr., son of the Civil War general who had run against Lincoln in 1864.

The move was unpopular in Brooklyn, whose leaders believed that McClellan would hurt down-ticket Brooklyn candidates; they concluded that running McClellan likely would cost them the district attorney and sheriff&#x27;s offices, not to mention borough and judicial races. Some observers believed that it was Murphy&#x27;s intention, despite the risk of lost votes in Brooklyn, as long as he could cut off the Kings County party&#x27;s independent base of patronage. Murphy&#x27;s highhandedness rankled others as well. At the City Committee meeting on September 18, party leaders from Queens, the Bronx and Richmond joined Brooklyn in expressing their concern. 

Independent Manhattan Democrats also objected to Murphy&#x27;s action, including the Greater New York Democracy, which decided for the Fusion ticket, and former Tammany police chief Bill Devery, who decided to run for Mayor himself. Even several Tammany chiefs questioned the wisdom of the McClellan choice. Brooklyn party leader Hugh McLaughlin decided to test Murphy&#x27;s hold over the outer boroughs and gave an interview promising to oppose Murphy&#x27;s nominee at the city convention.

At the Democratic City Committee meeting on September 24, Murphy defied Brooklyn leaders to take the fight over McClellan to the Convention the next week, knowing that Tammany controlled a majority of the delegates. With a view to sowing confusion among the Fusionists, Murphy without consultation outside of Tammany proposed adding two Fusion candidates to the ticket—Edward M. Grout for Controller and Charles V. Fornes for President of the Board of Aldermen. The proposed nomination of two Fusion candidates by Tammany so disturbed the non-Tammany Democrats that, after much behind-the-scenes scheming, McLaughlin announced a complex plan the day before the convention to either dislodge McClellan from the ticket and Murphy from Tammany in the process or provide an anti-Tammany Democratic ticket that would run against Tammany&#x27;s ticket.

The convention took place on October 1, 1903 at Carnegie Hall. At the beginning it looked as if the Kings County delegation could engineer a stampede against the Tammany ticket. Brooklyn Assistant District Attorney Martin W. Littleton led the charge, looking directly at Murphy in front of him and delivering a blistering speech scoring Tammany &quot;treachery&quot; for selecting Democratic &quot;traitor&quot; Grout. Robert H. Elder followed him, placing in nomination Julian D. Fairchild in Grout&#x27;s place and reminded the convention that Grout had been a Republican and left the Brooklyn Democrats because of their association with Tammany.

Littleton rose again to remind the delegates that Grout once called Tammany a &quot;stench in his nostrils.&quot; The &quot;excitement reached a climax&quot; when one Tammany leader broke with Murphy against Grout causing &quot;wild applause.&quot; Murphy and the Tammany leaders sat through the abuse, smiling, and in the end the Brooklyn Democrats were routed by the near unanimous Tammany vote. While the Kings County delegation under the leadership of state senator Patrick H. McCarren made show of unity by moving the unanimous nomination of McClellan when its nominee was defeated, a similar motion for Grout and Fornes, however, was &quot;howled down.&quot;

The next day at the Brooklyn Democratic headquarters in the auction room on Willoughby Street, all talk of McLaughlin&#x27;s plan for an opposition ticket to Tammany&#x27;s had ceased. If McClellan won the mayoralty, all Brooklyn patronage would go through him and Tammany. While Brooklyn maintained its objection to Grout and Fornes, that did little good for the Brooklyn party unless McClellan lost, but McCarren and the rest at the Convention eventually endorsed McClellan. As one Democrat put it: &quot;Tammany&#x27;s coming to Brooklyn sure and the Old Man [McLaughlin] will take his medicine.&quot; For McLaughlin whether he would remain in charge of the Brooklyn Democrats now depended on his former subordinate McCarren. McCarren, however, used the occasion to take over the Brooklyn organization, and in the turmoil Hylan made his first move for party advancement.

===Mayor of New York City===

Hylan defeated the reformer John Purroy Mitchel in the four-sided 1917 mayoral election, restoring the power of Tammany at City Hall. Hylan was the first Democratic candidate to obtain a significant portion of the African American voter base. He easily won re-election in 1921 but was defeated for re-nomination in 1925 by State Senator James J. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Walker. Walker later appointed Hylan to the municipal judiciary.

As mayor, Hylan railed against &quot;the interests&quot; and put in motion the building of the Independent Subway System, which would later become part of the New York City Subway. On December 30, 1925, Hylan resigned from office one day before the end of his term in order to assure his eligibility for a $4,205 annual pension from the city. The Hylan Boulevard in Staten Island was renamed for him in 1923 over the protests of his political opponents.

Hylan developed a reputation for not being exceptionally intelligent or well-spoken. According to Robert Moses, Hylan went through most of a mayoral campaign using just one stump speech: a call to keep the five-cent subway fare in place. He asked for Moses&#x27; help in preparing another, and Moses obliged. The first time Hylan tried to deliver the new speech, he reached the climax—a Revolutionary War-inspired &quot;I call for the spirit of 1776&quot;—but rather than closing out on a high note, Hylan missed the context and read out the number&#x27;s digits, saying, &quot;I call for the spirit of one-seven-seven-six.&quot;

In another story recounted about Hylan&#x27;s supposed lack of intelligence and articulateness, his successor Jimmy Walker appointed Hylan as judge of the Queens Children&#x27;s Court. When journalist Alva Johnston asked Walker why he would appoint a rival to a judgeship, Walker quipped, &quot;The children now can be tried by their peer.&quot;

====Famous speech====
Hylan&#x27;s most famous statement against &quot;the interests&quot; was the following speech, made in 1922, while he was the sitting Mayor of New York City:

==Death==
Hylan died of a heart attack at the age of 67 on January 12, 1936, at his home in Forest Hills, Queens.

<text>The cubic inch (symbol in3) is a unit of volume in the Imperial units and United States customary units systems. It is the volume of a cube with each of its three dimensions (length, width, and height) being one inch long which is equivalent to of a US gallon.

The cubic inch and the cubic foot are used as units of volume in the United States, although the common SI units of volume, the liter, milliliter, and cubic meter, are also used, especially in manufacturing and high technology. One cubic inch is exactly .

One cubic foot is equal to exactly , as 123 = 1728.

==Notation conventions==
* The following abbreviations have been used to denote the cubic inch: cubic in, cu inch, cu in, cui, cu. in.
* The IEEE standard symbol is: in3
* In internal combustion engines, the following abbreviations are used to denote cubic inch displacement: c.i.d., cid, CID, c.i., ci

==Equivalence with other units of volume==
One cubic inch is equal to:
* Exactly cubic feet
* Exactly US gallon
* Exactly US liquid quart
* Exactly US liquid pint
* Exactly US gill
* Exactly US fluid ounce
* Exactly US tablespoons
* Exactly US teaspoons
* Exactly US bushel
* Exactly US dry quart
* Exactly US dry pint
* ≈0.00360465 imperial gallon
* ≈0.0144186 imperial quart
* ≈0.0288372 imperial pint

* ≈1.153488 imperial tablespoons
* ≈4.613952 imperial fluid drams
* Exactly of a barrel of crude oil
* Exactly 
* Exactly or cubic centimeters
* Exactly 

==Uses of the cubic inch==

===Electrical box volume===
The cubic inch was established decades ago in the National Electrical Code as the conventional unit in North America for measuring the volume of electrical boxes. Because of the extensive export of electrical equipment to other countries, some usage of the non-SI unit can be found outside North America.

===Engine displacement===
====North America====
The cubic inch was formerly used by the automotive industry and aircraft industry in North America (through the early 1980s) to express the nominal engine displacement for the engines of new automobiles, trucks, aircraft, etc. The cubic inch is still used for this purpose in classic car collecting. The auto industry now uses liters for this purpose, while reciprocating engines used in commercial aircraft often have model numbers based on the cubic inch displacement. The fifth generation Ford Mustang has a Boss 302 version that reflects this heritage - with a five-liter (302 cubic inch) engine similar to the original Boss. Chevrolet has also revived this usage on its 427 Corvette. Dodge has a &quot;Challenger 392&quot; (a conversion from its 6.4 liter V8 engine).

<doc id="214117" wikidata="Q192129" url="?curid=214117" title="Ustica">
<text>Ustica (; ) is a small Italian island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is about across and is situated north of Capo Gallo, Sicily. Roughly 1,300 people live in the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of the same name. There is a regular ferry service from the island to Palermo in Sicily.

==History==

Excavations begun in 1989 at Tramontana, also known as Faraglioni, have unearthed what was a large prehistoric village dating from the 14th to the 13th century BC. The foundations of some 300 stone-built houses were discovered, and the defensive walls of the settlement are among the strongest fortifications of any period known in Italy. It is believed that these early settlers came over from the Aeolian Islands.

In historic times, the island has been populated at least since about 1500 BC by Phoenician peoples. In ancient Greece, the Island was named &quot;Osteodes&quot; (ossuary) in memory of the thousands of Carthaginian mutineers left there to die of hunger in the 4th century BC. The Romans renamed the island &quot;Ustica&quot;, Latin for &quot;burnt&quot;, for its black rocks. The island is also known locally as the &quot;black pearl&quot;.

In the 6th century, a Benedictine community settled in the island, but was soon forced to move because of ongoing wars between Europeans and Arabs. Attempts to colonize the island in the Middle Ages failed because of raids by Barbary pirates.

In the mid-18th century, the island was settled by approximately 90 people from the island of Lipari, an island also located north of Sicily, but east of Ustica. They brought with them the patron saint of Lipari, Bartholomew the Apostle, who became the patron saint of Ustica as well. In the mid-to-late 19th century and early 20th century, as the population of the island grew too large, hundreds of Ustican families emigrated to the United States. Many of these families settled in New Orleans and surrounding areas, where there are today thousands of descendants whose ties remain strong to Ustica. Among them was Angelina Caravella, the mother of famous jazz singer and trumpet player Louis Prima. A smaller number of families settled in San Jose and San Francisco, in New York, Massachusetts, Oregon, Montana and in Chicago.

===Fascist prison island===
During the Fascist years in Italy and until the 1950s, Ustica was used as an island prison. Benito Mussolini banished thousands of political opponents to Ustica, often as many as 1,500 at a time; many were homosexuals. Both Antonio Gramsci and Amadeo Bordiga were sent there. In the early 1940s Yugoslav war prisoners were crammed onto the island, and many of them died from malnutrition and tuberculosis. In the 1950s they were followed by suspected Mafiosi expelled from Sicily.

===Ustica Massacre===

On 27 June 1980, Itavia Flight 870 crashed into the sea off the island while en route to Palermo, killing all 81 people on board. The event became known as the &quot;Ustica massacre&quot;.

==Environment==
The island has limited sources of water, and vegetation is consequently scarce. The coast has numerous rocks and grottoes.

Ustica is home to the honeybee &quot;Apis mellifera sicula&quot;.

==Tourism==

Ustica is particularly known for scuba diving, with a number of diving schools established on the island. Recreational divers are attracted by the relatively deep dives, which are a feature of the island&#x27;s volcanic geology.

==Archaeology==
Ustica contains the remains of the Bronze Age settlement of Villaggio dei Faraglioni. It showcases organized urban planning with huts and narrow roadways along its northern periphery, representing a well-preserved example of ancient Mediterranean civilization between 1400 and 1200 BC. Recent archaeological investigations unveiled a sophisticated fortification system beneath the village. Using non-invasive techniques such as ground-penetrating radar and electrical resistivity tomography, researchers identified an 820-foot-long arc-shaped stone wall, standing 13 to 16 feet tall.

==Climate==
Ustica&#x27;s climate is classified as hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in February. The annual precipitation is , of which October is the wettest with , while July is the driest with only .

<doc id="214121" wikidata="Q1638347" url="?curid=214121" title="List of largest optical reflecting telescopes">
<text>This list of the largest optical reflecting telescopes with objective diameters of or greater is sorted by aperture, which is a measure of the light-gathering power and resolution of a reflecting telescope. The mirrors themselves can be larger than the aperture, and some telescopes may use aperture synthesis through interferometry. Telescopes designed to be used as optical astronomical interferometers such as the Keck I and II used together as the Keck Interferometer (up to 85 m) can reach higher resolutions, although at a narrower range of observations. When the two mirrors are on one mount, the combined mirror spacing of the Large Binocular Telescope (22.8 m) allows fuller use of the aperture synthesis.

Largest does not always equate to being the best telescopes, and overall light gathering power of the optical system can be a poor measure of a telescope&#x27;s performance. Space-based telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, take advantage of being above the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to reach higher resolution and greater light gathering through longer exposure times. Location in the northern or southern hemisphere of the Earth can also limit what part of the sky can be observed, and climate conditions at the observatory site affect how often the telescope can be used each year.

The combination of large mirrors, locations selected for stable atmosphere and favorable climate conditions, and active optics and adaptive optics to correct for much of atmospheric turbulence allow the largest Earth based telescopes to reach higher resolution than the Hubble Space Telescope. Another advantage of Earth based telescopes is the comparatively low cost of upgrading and replacing instruments.

==Table of reflecting telescopes==
This list is ordered by optical aperture, which has historically been a useful gauge of limiting resolution, optical area, physical size, and cost. Multiple mirror telescopes that are on the same mount and can form a single combined image are ranked by their equivalent aperture. Fixed altitude telescopes (e.g. HET) are also ranked by their equivalent aperture. All telescopes with an effective aperture of at least at visible or near-infrared wavelengths are included.

There are only a few sites capable of polishing the mirrors for these telescopes. SAGEM in France polished the four VLT mirrors, the two Gemini mirrors, and the 36 segments for GTC. The Steward Observatory Mirror Lab cast and polished the two LBT mirrors, the two Magellan mirrors, the MMT replacement mirror, and the LSST primary/tertiary mirror. It is currently making the mirrors for the Giant Magellan Telescope. The Keck segments were made by Schott AG. The SALT and LAMOST segments were cast and polished by LZOS. The mirror for Subaru was cast by Corning and polished at Contraves Brashear Systems in Pennsylvania, USA.

This table does not include all the largest mirrors manufactured. The Steward Observatory Mirror Lab produced the 6.5 metre f/1.25 collimator used in the Large Optical Test and Integration Site of Lockheed Martin, used for vacuum optical testing of other telescopes.

Segmented mirrors are also referred to as mosaic mirrors. Single mirrors are also referred to monolithic mirrors, and can be sub-categorized in types, such as solid or honeycomb.

==Chronological list of largest telescopes==
These telescopes were the largest in the world at the time of their construction, by the same aperture criterion as above.

==Future telescopes==

<doc id="214124" wikidata="Q1055314" url="?curid=214124" title="Umbral calculus">
<text>The term umbral calculus has two related but distinct meanings. 

In mathematics, before the 1970s, umbral calculus referred to the surprising similarity between seemingly unrelated polynomial equations and certain shadowy techniques used to prove them. These techniques were introduced in 1861 by John Blissard and are sometimes called Blissard&#x27;s symbolic method. They are often attributed to Édouard Lucas (or James Joseph Sylvester), who used the technique extensively. The use of shadowy techniques was put on a solid mathematical footing starting in the 1970s, and the resulting mathematical theory is also referred to as &quot;umbral calculus&quot;.

== History ==
In the 1930s and 1940s, Eric Temple Bell attempted to set the umbral calculus on a rigorous footing, however his attempt in making this kind of argument logically rigorous was unsuccessful.

The combinatorialist John Riordan in his book &quot;Combinatorial Identities&quot; published in the 1960s, used techniques of this sort extensively.

In the 1970s, Steven Roman, Gian-Carlo Rota, and others developed the umbral calculus by means of linear functionals on spaces of polynomials. Currently, &quot;umbral calculus&quot; refers to the study of Sheffer sequences, including polynomial sequences of binomial type and Appell sequences, but may encompass systematic correspondence techniques of the calculus of finite differences.

==19th-century umbral calculus==
The method is a notational procedure used for deriving identities involving indexed sequences of numbers by &quot;pretending that the indices are exponents&quot;. Construed literally, it is absurd, and yet it is successful: identities derived via the umbral calculus can also be properly derived by more complicated methods that can be taken literally without logical difficulty.

An example involves the Bernoulli polynomials. Consider, for example, the ordinary binomial expansion (which contains a binomial coefficient):

:formula_1

and the remarkably similar-looking relation on the Bernoulli polynomials:

:formula_2

Compare also the ordinary derivative

:formula_3

to a very similar-looking relation on the Bernoulli polynomials: 
:formula_4

These similarities allow one to construct &quot;umbral&quot; proofs, which on the surface cannot be correct, but seem to work anyway. Thus, for example, by pretending that the subscript &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; is an exponent:

:formula_5

and then differentiating, one gets the desired result:

:formula_6

In the above, the variable &quot;b&quot; is an &quot;umbra&quot; (Latin for &quot;shadow&quot;).

See also Faulhaber&#x27;s formula.

==Umbral Taylor series==
In differential calculus, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function&#x27;s derivatives at a single point. That is, a real or complex-valued function &quot;f&quot; (&quot;x&quot;) that is analytic at formula_7 can be written as: 

formula_8

Similar relationships were also observed in the theory of finite differences. The umbral version of the Taylor series is given by a similar expression involving the &quot;k&quot;-th forward differences formula_9 of a polynomial function &quot;f&quot;,

:formula_10

where

:formula_11

is the Pochhammer symbol used here for the falling sequential product. A similar relationship holds for the backward differences and rising factorial.

This series is also known as the &quot;Newton series&quot; or Newton&#x27;s forward difference expansion.
The analogy to Taylor&#x27;s expansion is utilized in the calculus of finite differences.

==Modern umbral calculus==

Another combinatorialist, Gian-Carlo Rota, pointed out that the mystery vanishes if one considers the linear functional &quot;L&quot; on polynomials in &quot;z&quot; defined by

:formula_12

Then, using the definition of the Bernoulli polynomials and the definition and linearity of &quot;L&quot;, one can write

:formula_13

This enables one to replace occurrences of formula_14 by formula_15, that is, move the &quot;n&quot; from a subscript to a superscript (the key operation of umbral calculus). For instance, we can now prove that:

:formula_16

Rota later stated that much confusion resulted from the failure to distinguish between three equivalence relations that occur frequently in this topic, all of which were denoted by &quot;=&quot;. 

In a paper published in 1964, Rota used umbral methods to establish the recursion formula satisfied by the Bell numbers, which enumerate partitions of finite sets.

In the paper of Roman and Rota cited below, the umbral calculus is characterized as the study of the umbral algebra, defined as the algebra of linear functionals on the vector space of polynomials in a variable &quot;x&quot;, with a product &quot;L&quot;1&quot;L&quot;2 of linear functionals defined by

:formula_17

When polynomial sequences replace sequences of numbers as images of &quot;yn&quot; under the linear mapping &quot;L&quot;, then the umbral method is seen to be an essential component of Rota&#x27;s general theory of special polynomials, and that theory is the umbral calculus by some more modern definitions of the term. A small sample of that theory can be found in the article on polynomial sequences of binomial type. Another is the article titled Sheffer sequence.

Rota later applied umbral calculus extensively in his paper with Shen to study the various combinatorial properties of the cumulants.

<text>Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred &amp; Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder is a novel by the English writer Evelyn Waugh, first published in 1945. It follows, from the 1920s to the early 1940s, the life and romances of Charles Ryder, especially his friendship with the Flytes, a family of wealthy English Catholics who live in a palatial mansion, Brideshead Castle. Ryder has relationships with two of the Flytes: Lord Sebastian and Lady Julia. The novel explores themes including Catholicism and nostalgia for the age of English aristocracy. A well-received television adaptation of the novel was produced in an 11-part miniseries by Granada Television in 1981. In 2008, it was adapted as a film.

== Plot ==
The novel is divided into three parts, framed by a prologue and epilogue.

===&quot;Prologue&quot;===
The prologue takes place during the final years of the Second World War. Charles Ryder and his battalion are sent to a country estate called Brideshead, which prompts his recollections of the rest of the story.

===&quot;Et In Arcadia Ego&quot;===

In 1923, protagonist and narrator Charles Ryder, an undergraduate reading history at a college very similar to Hertford College, Oxford, is befriended by Lord Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of the Marquess of Marchmain and an undergraduate at Christ Church. Both Charles and Sebastian had matriculated at Oxford in the Autumn of 1922, Charles doing so shortly before his 19th birthday. The following year, Sebastian introduces Charles to his eccentric friends, including the haughty aesthete and homosexual Anthony Blanche. Sebastian also takes Charles to his family&#x27;s palatial country house, Brideshead Castle, in Wiltshire, where Charles later meets the rest of Sebastian&#x27;s family, including his sister, Lady Julia.

During the long summer holiday, Charles returns home to London, where he lives with his widowed father, Edward Ryder. Charles is called back to Brideshead after Sebastian incurs a minor injury, and Sebastian and Charles spend the remainder of the holiday together.

Sebastian&#x27;s family is Catholic, which influences the Flytes&#x27; lives as well as the content of their conversations, all of which surprises Charles, who had always believed Christianity was &quot;without substance or merit&quot;. Lord Marchmain had converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism to marry his wife, but he later abandoned both his marriage and his new religion, and moved to Venice. Left alone, Lady Marchmain focuses even more on her faith, which is also enthusiastically espoused by her elder son, the Earl of Brideshead (&quot;Bridey&quot;), and by her younger daughter, Lady Cordelia.

===&quot;Brideshead Deserted&quot;===

The Flyte family becomes aware of Sebastian&#x27;s heavy drinking, and attempts to stop him are detrimental. Lady Marchmain falls out with Charles and he leaves Brideshead for what he thinks is the last time. 

Julia marries the rich but unsophisticated Canadian-born businessman and politician Rex Mottram. This marriage causes great sorrow to her mother because Rex, though initially planning to convert to Catholicism, turns out to be a divorcé with an ex-wife living in Canada. He and Julia subsequently marry without fanfare in the Savoy Chapel, an Anglican church where marriage between divorcés with one or more prior living spouses is permissible.

Sebastian descends into alcoholism, drifting away from the family over a two-year period. He flees to Morocco, where his drinking ruins his health. He eventually finds some solace as an under-porter and object of charity at a Catholic monastery in Tunisia. Sebastian&#x27;s drifting leads to Charles&#x27;s own estrangement from the Flytes. 

Julia asks Charles to go and find Sebastian because Lady Marchmain (Sebastian&#x27;s mother) is ill. Charles finds Sebastian in the monastery in Morocco. Sebastian is too ill to return to England, so Charles returns to London to see Brideshead and sort out Sebastian&#x27;s financial affairs. 

Charles is commissioned by Brideshead to paint images of Marchmain House in London before its demolition. The paintings are very successful. Charles talks to Cordelia while he paints and discovers more about the Flyte family.

===&quot;A Twitch Upon the Thread&quot;===
Charles finds success as an architectural painter and visits Latin America to portray the buildings there. Charles marries and fathers two children, but he becomes cold towards his wife, Celia, and she is unfaithful to him. Julia separates from Rex Mottram and Charles eventually forms a relationship with her. 

Charles and Julia plan to divorce their respective spouses so they can marry each other.

Cordelia returns from ministering to the wounded in the Spanish Civil War with disturbing news about Sebastian&#x27;s nomadic existence and steady decline over the past few years. She predicts he will die soon in the Tunisian monastery.

On the eve of the Second World War, the ageing Lord Marchmain, terminally ill, returns to Brideshead to die in his ancestral home. Appalled by the marriage of his elder son Brideshead to a middle-class widow past childbearing age, he names Julia heir to the estate, which prospectively offers Charles marital ownership of the house. However, Lord Marchmain&#x27;s return to the faith on his deathbed changes the situation: Julia decides she cannot enter a sinful marriage with Charles, who has also been moved by Lord Marchmain&#x27;s acceptance of the Last Rites.

===&quot;Epilogue&quot;===
The plot concludes in the early spring of 1943 (or possibly 1944 – the date is disputed). Charles is &quot;homeless, childless, middle-aged and loveless&quot;. He has become an army officer and finds himself unexpectedly billeted at Brideshead, which has been taken into military use. He finds the house damaged by the army, but the private chapel, closed after Lady Marchmain&#x27;s death in 1926, has been reopened for the soldiers&#x27; use. It occurs to him that the efforts of the builders – and, by extension, God&#x27;s efforts – were not in vain, although their purposes may have appeared, for a time, to have been frustrated.

==Motifs==
===Catholicism===
Catholicism is a significant theme of the book. Evelyn Waugh was a convert to Catholicism and &quot;Brideshead&quot; depicts the Catholic faith in a secular literary form. Waugh wrote to his literary agent A. D. Peters:I hope the last conversation with Cordelia gives the theological clue. The whole thing is steeped in theology, but I begin to agree that the theologians won&#x27;t recognize it.

The book brings the reader, through the narration of the initially agnostic Charles Ryder, in contact with the severely flawed but deeply Catholic Flyte family. The Catholic themes of divine grace and reconciliation are pervasive in the book. Most of the major characters undergo a conversion in some way or another. Lord Marchmain, a convert from Anglicanism to Catholicism, who lived as an adulterer, is reconciled with the Church on his deathbed. Julia, who entered a marriage with Rex Mottram that is invalid in the eyes of the Catholic Church, is involved in an extramarital affair with Charles. Julia realizes that marrying Charles will separate her forever from her faith and decides to leave him, in spite of her great attachment to him. Sebastian, the charming and flamboyant alcoholic, ends up in service to a monastery while struggling against his alcoholism.

Most significant is Charles&#x27;s apparent conversion, which is expressed subtly at the end of the book, set more than 20 years after his first meeting Sebastian. Charles kneels down in front of the tabernacle of the Brideshead chapel and says a prayer, &quot;an ancient, newly learned form of words&quot; – implying recent instruction in the catechism. Waugh speaks of his belief in grace in a letter to Lady Mary Lygon:I believe that everyone in his (or her) life has the moment when he is open to Divine Grace. It&#x27;s there, of course, for the asking all the time, but human lives are so planned that usually there&#x27;s a particular time – sometimes, like Hubert, on his deathbed – when all resistance is down and grace can come flooding in.

Waugh quotes from a short story by G. K. Chesterton to illustrate the nature of grace. Cordelia, in conversation with Charles Ryder, quotes a passage from the Father Brown detective story &quot;The Queer Feet&quot;:I caught him, with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world, and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread.

This quotation provides the foundation for Waugh&#x27;s Catholic treatment of the interplay of free will and grace in the moment of conversion.

The same themes were criticised by Waugh&#x27;s contemporaries. Novelist Henry Green wrote to Waugh:The end was not for me. As you can imagine my heart was in my mouth all through the deathbed scene, hoping against hope that the old man would not give way, that is, take the course he eventually did.

Edmund Wilson, who had praised Waugh as the hope of the English novel, wrote:The last scenes are extravagantly absurd, with an absurdity that would be worthy of Waugh at his best if it were not – painful to say – meant quite seriously.

===Nostalgia for an age of English nobility===
The Flyte family may be taken to symbolise the English nobility. One reads in the book that Brideshead has &quot;the atmosphere of a better age&quot;, and (referring to the deaths of Lady Marchmain&#x27;s brothers in the Great War) &quot;these men must die to make a world for Hooper ... so that things might be safe for the travelling salesman, with his polygonal pince-nez, his fat, wet handshake, his grinning dentures&quot;.

According to Martin Amis, the book &quot;squarely identifies egalitarianism as its foe and proceeds to rubbish it accordingly&quot;.

=== Charles and Sebastian&#x27;s relationship ===

The question of whether the relationship between Charles and Sebastian is homosexual or platonic has been debated, particularly in an extended exchange between David Bittner and John Osborne in the &quot;Evelyn Waugh Newsletter and Studies&quot; from 1987 to 1991. In 1994 Paul Buccio argued that the relationship was in the Victorian tradition of &quot;intimate male friendships&quot;, which includes &quot;Pip and Herbert Pocket [from Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot;], ... Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, Ratty and Mole (&quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;)&quot;, and Tennyson and Arthur Henry Hallam (&quot;In Memoriam&quot;). David Higdon argued that &quot;[I]t is impossible to regard Sebastian as other than gay; [and] Charles is so homoerotic he must at least be &quot;cheerful&quot;&quot;; and that the attempt of some critics to downplay the homoerotic dimension of &quot;Brideshead&quot; is part of &quot;a much larger and more important sexual war being fought as entrenched heterosexuality strives to maintain its hegemony over important twentieth century works&quot;. In 2008 Christopher Hitchens derided &quot;the ridiculous word &#x27;platonic&#x27; that for some peculiar reason still crops up in discussion of the story&quot;.

The phrase &quot;our naughtiness [was] high on the catalogue of grave sins&quot; is also seen as a suggestion that their relationship is homosexual, because this is a mortal sin in Roman Catholic doctrine. Attention has also been drawn to the fact that Charles impatiently awaits Sebastian&#x27;s letters, and the suggestion in the novel that one of the reasons Charles is later in love with Julia is her physical similarity to Sebastian. When the two become a couple in the novel&#x27;s third part, Julia asks Charles, &quot;You loved him, didn&#x27;t you?&quot; to which Charles replies, &quot;Oh yes. He was the forerunner.&quot;

Waugh wrote in 1947 that &quot;Charles&#x27;s romantic affection for Sebastian is part due to the glitter of the new world Sebastian represents, part to the protective feeling of a strong towards a weak character, and part a foreshadowing of the love for Julia which is to be the consuming passion of his mature years.&quot; In the novel, Cara, Lord Marchmain&#x27;s mistress, says to Charles that his romantic relationship with Sebastian forms part of a process of emotional development typical of &quot;the English and the Germans&quot;. This passage is quoted at the beginning of Paul M. Buccio&#x27;s essay on the Victorian and Edwardian tradition of romantic male friendships.

==Principal characters==
*Charles Ryder – The protagonist and narrator of the story was raised primarily by his father after his mother died. Charles&#x27;s family background is financially comfortable but emotionally hollow. He is unsure about his desires or goals in life, and is dazzled by the charming, flamboyant and seemingly carefree young Lord Sebastian Flyte. Charles, though dissatisfied with what life seems to offer, has modest success both as a student and later as a painter; less so as an Army officer. His path repeatedly crosses those of various members of the Marchmain family, and each time they awaken something deep within him. It has been noted that Charles Ryder bears some resemblance to artist Felix Kelly (1914–1994), who painted murals for aristocratic country houses. Kelly was commissioned to paint murals for Castle Howard, which was used as a location in the television series and is where Ryder is depicted painting a mural for the Garden Room.
*Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Ryder – Educated at Oxford University himself, Charles&#x27;s father is a somewhat distant and eccentric figure, but possessed of a keen wit. He seems determined to teach Charles to stand on his own feet. When Charles is forced to spend his holidays with him because he has already spent his allowance for the term, Ned, in what are considered some of the funniest passages in the book, strives to make Charles as uncomfortable as possible, indirectly teaching him to mind his finances more carefully.
*Lord Marchmain (Alexander Flyte, Marquess of Marchmain) – As a young man, Lord Marchmain fell in love with a Roman Catholic woman and converted to marry her. The marriage was unhappy and, after the First World War, he refused to return to England, settling in Venice with his Italian mistress, Cara.
*Lady Marchmain (Teresa Flyte, Marchioness of Marchmain) – A member of an ancient Recusant Roman Catholic family (the people that Waugh himself most admired). She brought up her children as Roman Catholics against her husband&#x27;s wishes. Abandoned by her husband, Lady Marchmain rules over her household, enforcing her Roman Catholic morality upon her children.
*&quot;Bridey&quot; (Earl of Brideshead) – The elder son of Lord and Lady Marchmain who, as the Marquess&#x27;s heir, holds the courtesy title &quot;Earl of Brideshead&quot;. He follows his mother&#x27;s strict Roman Catholic beliefs, and once aspired to the priesthood. This manifests itself once or twice through a considered sense of justice and fairness. For example, during the General Strike he refuses to oppose the strikers, despite the general opposition within his peer group. However, he is unable to connect in an emotional way with most people, who find him cold and distant. His actual Christian name is not revealed.
* Lord Sebastian Flyte – The younger son of Lord and Lady Marchmain is haunted by a profound unhappiness brought on by a troubled relationship with his mother. An otherwise charming and attractive companion, he numbs himself with alcohol. He forms a deep friendship with Charles. Over time, however, the numbness brought on by alcohol becomes his main desire. He is thought to be based on Alastair Hugh Graham (whose name was mistakenly substituted for Sebastian&#x27;s several times in the original manuscript), Hugh Patrick Lygon and Stephen Tennant. Also, his relationship with his teddy bear, Aloysius, was inspired by John Betjeman and his teddy bear Archibald Ormsby-Gore.
*Lady Julia Flyte – The elder daughter of Lord and Lady Marchmain, who comes out as a debutante at the beginning of the story, eventually marrying Rex Mottram. Charles loves her for much of their lives, due in part to her resemblance to her brother Sebastian. Julia refuses at first to be controlled by the conventions of Roman Catholicism, but turns to it later in life.
*Lady Cordelia Flyte – The youngest of the siblings is the most devout and least conflicted in her beliefs. She aspires solely to serve God.
*Anthony Blanche – A friend of Charles and Sebastian&#x27;s from Oxford, and an overt homosexual. His background is unclear but there are hints that he may be of Italian or Spanish extraction. Of all the characters, Anthony has the keenest insight into the self-deception of the people around him. Although he is witty, amiable and always an interesting companion, he manages to make Charles uncomfortable with his stark honesty, flamboyance, and flirtatiousness. The character is likely based on Brian Howard, a contemporary of Waugh at Oxford and a flamboyant homosexual, although the scene in which Blanche declaims extracts from &quot;The Waste Land&quot; through a megaphone from his college window was inspired by Harold Acton. When Sebastian and Charles return to Oxford, in the Michaelmas term of 1923, they learn that Anthony Blanche has been sent down.
*Viscount &quot;Boy&quot; Mulcaster – An acquaintance of Charles from Oxford. Brash, bumbling and thoughtless, he personifies the privileged hauteur of the British aristocracy. He later proves an engaging and fondly doting uncle to &quot;John-john&quot; Ryder. As with Lord Brideshead, his Christian name is never revealed.
*Lady Celia Ryder – Charles&#x27;s wife, &quot;Boy&quot; Mulcaster&#x27;s sister, and Julia&#x27;s former schoolmate; a vivacious and socially active beauty. Charles marries her largely for convenience, which is revealed by Celia&#x27;s infidelities. Charles feels freed by Celia&#x27;s betrayal and decides to pursue love elsewhere, outside their marriage.
*Rex Mottram – A Canadian of great ambition, said to be based on Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Birkenhead and Brendan Bracken. Mottram wins a seat in the House of Commons. Through his marriage to Julia, he connects to the Marchmains as another step on the ladder to the top. He is disappointed with the results, and he and Julia agree to lead separate lives.
*&quot;Sammy&quot; Samgrass – A fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and Lady Marchmain&#x27;s &quot;pet don&quot;. Lady Marchmain funds Samgrass&#x27;s projects and flatters his academic ego, while asking him to keep Sebastian in line and save him from expulsion. Samgrass uses his connections with the aristocracy to further his personal ambitions. Samgrass is an unflattering portrait of Maurice Bowra. Waugh was annoyed when friends did not recognize Bowra, and additionally annoyed to hear that Bowra claimed to enjoy the caricature.
*Cara – Lord Marchmain&#x27;s Italian mistress. She is very protective of Lord Marchmain and is forthright and insightful in her relationship with Charles.

===Minor characters===
*Jasper – Charles&#x27;s cousin, who gives him advice about student life at Oxford, which Charles ignores.
*Kurt – Sebastian&#x27;s German friend. A deeply inadequate ex-soldier with a permanently septic foot (due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound) whom Sebastian meets in Tunisia, a man so inept that he needs Sebastian to look after him.
*Mrs. (Beryl) Muspratt – The widow of an admiral, she meets and marries a smitten Brideshead, but never becomes the mistress of the great house.
*&quot;Nanny&quot; Hawkins – Beloved nanny to the four Flyte children, who lives in retirement at Brideshead.
*Lieutenant Hooper – Newest platoon commander in Charles Ryder&#x27;s unit.

==Waugh&#x27;s statements about the novel==
Waugh wrote that the novel &quot;deals with what is theologically termed &#x27;the operation of Grace&#x27;, that is to say, the unmerited and unilateral act of love by which God continually calls souls to Himself&quot;. This is achieved by an examination of the Roman Catholic aristocratic Flyte family as seen by the narrator, Charles Ryder.

In various letters, Waugh refers to the novel a number of times as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;; however, in 1950 he wrote to Graham Greene stating &quot;I re-read &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; and was appalled.&quot; In Waugh&#x27;s preface to his revised edition of &quot;Brideshead&quot; (1959), the author explained the circumstances in which the novel was written, following a minor parachute accident in the six months between December 1943 and June 1944. He was mildly disparaging of the novel, stating; &quot;It was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster – the period of soya beans and Basic English – and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language which now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful.&quot;

==Reception==
===Acclaim===
In the United States, &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; was the Book of the Month Club selection for January 1946. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; No. 80 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 45 on the BBC survey The Big Read. In 2005, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to the present. In 2009, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine listed it as one of the 100 best books of world literature.

==Adaptations==
In 1981 &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; was adapted as an 11-episode TV serial, produced by Granada Television and aired on ITV, starring Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder and Anthony Andrews as Lord Sebastian Flyte. The bulk of the serial was directed by Charles Sturridge, with a few sequences filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. John Mortimer was given credit as writer, but most of the scripts were based on work by producer Derek Granger.

To mark the 70th anniversary of its publication in 2015, BBC Radio 4 Extra rebroadcast a four-part adaptation (from 2003), with Ben Miles as Charles Ryder and Jamie Bamber as Lord Sebastian Flyte. This version was adapted for radio by Jeremy Front and directed by Marion Nancarrow.

In 2008 BBC Audiobooks released an unabridged reading of the book by Jeremy Irons. The recording is 11.5 hours long and consists of 10 CDs.
There is an abridged audiobook version read by Sir John Gielgud available on Youtube. 

In 2008 &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; was developed into a feature film of the same title, with Emma Thompson as Lady Marchmain, Matthew Goode as Charles Ryder, and Ben Whishaw as Lord Sebastian Flyte. The film was directed by Julian Jarrold and adapted by Jeremy Brock and Andrew Davies.

In 2020, it was announced that the novel will be adapted again for HBO. Andrew Garfield is set to play Charles Ryder, while Joe Alwyn will play Sebastian Flyte. Sebastian&#x27;s sister, Julia, will be played by Rooney Mara. Ralph Fiennes will reportedly play Lord Marchmain, while Cate Blanchett is said to be in negotiations to play Lady Marchmain. Production for the film was set to begin in spring 2021, with filming taking place both in the UK and Italy, but was postponed indefinitely. In 2022 Garfield confirmed his involvement by stating that “It’s a matter of time and schedule, and financing”.

==References in other media==

*In scene 2 of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1993), one character refers to another character who attends Oxford as &quot;Brideshead Regurgitated&quot;. Et in Arcadia ego, the Latin phrase which is the title of the major section (Book One) of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, is also a central theme to Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play. Stoppard&#x27;s phrase may have been inspired by the 1980s BBC comedy series &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, starring Tracey Ullman, Lenny Henry and David Copperfield, which featured a recurring sketch entitled &quot;Brideshead Regurgitated&quot;, with Henry in the role of Charles Ryder.
*In the early 1980s, following the release of the television series, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (from 1983, Australian Broadcasting Corporation) produced a radio show called &quot;Brunswick Heads Revisited&quot;. Brunswick Heads is a coastal town in northern New South Wales. The series was a spoof, and made fun of the &#x27;Englishness&#x27; of &quot;Brideshead&quot; and many amusing parallels could be drawn between the upper class characters from &quot;Brideshead&quot; and their opposite numbers from rural Australia.
*Paula Byrne&#x27;s biography of Evelyn Waugh, titled &quot;Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead&quot;, was published by HarperPress in the UK in August 2009 and HarperCollins New York in the US in April 2010. An excerpt was published in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; 9 August 2009 under the headline &quot;Sex Scandal Behind &#x27;Brideshead Revisited&#x27;&quot;. The book concerns the 7th Earl of Beauchamp, who was the father of Waugh&#x27;s friend Hugh Lygon. It states that the exiled Lord Marchmain is a version of Lord Beauchamp and Lady Marchmain of Lady Beauchamp, that the dissolute Lord Sebastian Flyte was modelled after Hugh Lygon and Lady Julia Flyte after Lady Mary Lygon. The book, which Byrne describes in the preface as a &quot;partial life&quot;, identifies other real-life bases for events and characters in Waugh&#x27;s novel, though Byrne argues carefully against simple one-to-one correspondences, suggesting instead that Waugh combined people, places and events into composite inventions, subtle transmutations of life into fiction. An illustrated extract appeared in the April 2010 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in advance of American publication.

*A fragment about the young Charles Ryder, entitled &quot;Charles Ryder&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, was found after Waugh&#x27;s death and is available in collections of Waugh&#x27;s short works

*It has been suggested that the novel is influenced by &quot;The Thibaults&quot; by Roger Martin du Gard, another novel that centres on an intense relationship between two young men of opposing religious backgrounds.

<text>In mathematics, a linear form (also known as a linear functional, a one-form, or a covector) is a linear map from a vector space to its field of scalars (often, the real numbers or the complex numbers).

If is a vector space over a field , the set of all linear functionals from to is itself a vector space over with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise. This space is called the dual space of , or sometimes the algebraic dual space, when a topological dual space is also considered. It is often denoted , or, when the field is understood, formula_1; other notations are also used, such as formula_2, formula_3 or formula_4 When vectors are represented by column vectors (as is common when a basis is fixed), then linear functionals are represented as row vectors, and their values on specific vectors are given by matrix products (with the row vector on the left).

== Examples ==

The constant zero function, mapping every vector to zero, is trivially a linear functional. Every other linear functional (such as the ones below) is surjective (that is, its range is all of ).
* Indexing into a vector: The second element of a three-vector is given by the one-form formula_5 That is, the second element of formula_6 is formula_7
* Mean: The mean element of an formula_8-vector is given by the one-form formula_9 That is, formula_10
* Sampling: Sampling with a kernel can be considered a one-form, where the one-form is the kernel shifted to the appropriate location.
* Net present value of a net cash flow, formula_11 is given by the one-form formula_12 where formula_13 is the discount rate. That is, formula_14

=== Linear functionals in R&quot;n&quot; ===
Suppose that vectors in the real coordinate space formula_15 are represented as column vectors
formula_16

For each row vector formula_17 there is a linear functional formula_18 defined by
formula_19
and each linear functional can be expressed in this form.

This can be interpreted as either the matrix product or the dot product of the row vector formula_20 and the column vector formula_21:
formula_22

=== Trace of a square matrix ===
The trace formula_23 of a square matrix formula_24 is the sum of all elements on its main diagonal. Matrices can be multiplied by scalars and two matrices of the same dimension can be added together; these operations make a vector space from the set of all formula_25 matrices. The trace is a linear functional on this space because formula_26 and formula_27 for all scalars formula_28 and all formula_25 matrices formula_30

=== (Definite) Integration ===
Linear functionals first appeared in functional analysis, the study of vector spaces of functions. A typical example of a linear functional is integration: the linear transformation defined by the Riemann integral
formula_31
is a linear functional from the vector space formula_32 of continuous functions on the interval formula_33 to the real numbers. The linearity of formula_34 follows from the standard facts about the integral:
formula_35

=== Evaluation ===
Let formula_36 denote the vector space of real-valued polynomial functions of degree formula_37 defined on an interval formula_38 If formula_39 then let formula_40 be the evaluation functional
formula_41
The mapping formula_42 is linear since
formula_43

If formula_44 are formula_45 distinct points in formula_46 then the evaluation functionals formula_47 formula_48 form a basis of the dual space of formula_36 ( proves this last fact using Lagrange interpolation).

=== Non-example ===
A function formula_50 having the equation of a line formula_51 with formula_52 (for example, formula_53) is a linear functional on formula_54, since it is not linear. It is, however, affine-linear.

== Visualization ==
In finite dimensions, a linear functional can be visualized in terms of its level sets, the sets of vectors which map to a given value. In three dimensions, the level sets of a linear functional are a family of mutually parallel planes; in higher dimensions, they are parallel hyperplanes. This method of visualizing linear functionals is sometimes introduced in general relativity texts, such as &quot;Gravitation&quot; by .

== Applications ==

=== Application to quadrature ===
If formula_44 are formula_45 distinct points in , then the linear functionals formula_57 defined above form a basis of the dual space of , the space of polynomials of degree formula_58 The integration functional is also a linear functional on , and so can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis elements. In symbols, there are coefficients formula_59 for which
formula_60
for all formula_61 This forms the foundation of the theory of numerical quadrature.

=== In quantum mechanics ===
Linear functionals are particularly important in quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanical systems are represented by Hilbert spaces, which are anti–isomorphic to their own dual spaces. A state of a quantum mechanical system can be identified with a linear functional. For more information see bra–ket notation.

=== Distributions ===
In the theory of generalized functions, certain kinds of generalized functions called distributions can be realized as linear functionals on spaces of test functions.

==Dual vectors and bilinear forms==
Every non-degenerate bilinear form on a finite-dimensional vector space induces an isomorphism such that 
formula_62

where the bilinear form on is denoted formula_63 (for instance, in Euclidean space, formula_64 is the dot product of and ).

The inverse isomorphism is , where is the unique element of such that
formula_65
for all formula_66

The above defined vector is said to be the dual vector of formula_67

In an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, analogous results hold by the Riesz representation theorem. There is a mapping from into its &quot;V&quot;.

==Relationship to bases==
===Basis of the dual space===
Let the vector space have a basis formula_68, not necessarily orthogonal. Then the dual space formula_1 has a basis formula_70 called the dual basis defined by the special property that
formula_71

Or, more succinctly,
formula_72

where formula_73 is the Kronecker delta. Here the superscripts of the basis functionals are not exponents but are instead contravariant indices.

A linear functional formula_74 belonging to the dual space formula_75 can be expressed as a linear combination of basis functionals, with coefficients (&quot;components&quot;) ,
formula_76

Then, applying the functional formula_74 to a basis vector formula_78 yields
formula_79

due to linearity of scalar multiples of functionals and pointwise linearity of sums of functionals. Then
formula_80

So each component of a linear functional can be extracted by applying the functional to the corresponding basis vector.

=== The dual basis and inner product ===
When the space carries an inner product, then it is possible to write explicitly a formula for the dual basis of a given basis. Let have (not necessarily orthogonal) basis formula_81 In three dimensions (), the dual basis can be written explicitly
formula_82
for formula_83 where &quot;ε&quot; is the Levi-Civita symbol and formula_84 the inner product (or dot product) on .

In higher dimensions, this generalizes as follows
formula_85
where formula_86 is the Hodge star operator.

== Over a ring ==
Modules over a ring are generalizations of vector spaces, which removes the restriction that coefficients belong to a field. Given a module over a ring , a linear form on is a linear map from to , where the latter is considered as a module over itself. The space of linear forms is always denoted , whether is a field or not. It is a right module if is a left module.

The existence of &quot;enough&quot; linear forms on a module is equivalent to projectivity. 
== Change of field ==

Suppose that formula_87 is a vector space over formula_88 Restricting scalar multiplication to formula_54 gives rise to a real vector space formula_90 called the of formula_91 
Any vector space formula_87 over formula_93 is also a vector space over formula_94 endowed with a complex structure; that is, there exists a real vector subspace formula_90 such that we can (formally) write formula_96 as formula_54-vector spaces.

=== Real versus complex linear functionals ===

Every linear functional on formula_87 is complex-valued while every linear functional on formula_90 is real-valued. If formula_100 then a linear functional on either one of formula_87 or formula_90 is non-trivial (meaning not identically formula_103) if and only if it is surjective (because if formula_104 then for any scalar formula_105 formula_106), where the image of a linear functional on formula_87 is formula_108 while the image of a linear functional on formula_90 is formula_110 
Consequently, the only function on formula_87 that is both a linear functional on formula_87 and a linear function on formula_90 is the trivial functional; in other words, formula_114 where formula_115 denotes the space&#x27;s algebraic dual space. 
However, every formula_93-linear functional on formula_87 is an formula_54-linear (meaning that it is additive and homogeneous over formula_54), but unless it is identically formula_120 it is not an formula_54-linear on formula_87 because its range (which is formula_93) is 2-dimensional over formula_110 Conversely, a non-zero formula_54-linear functional has range too small to be a formula_93-linear functional as well.

=== Real and imaginary parts ===

If formula_127 then denote its real part by formula_128 and its imaginary part by formula_129
Then formula_130 and formula_131 are linear functionals on formula_90 and formula_133 
The fact that formula_134 for all formula_135 implies that for all formula_136 
formula_137
and consequently, that formula_138 and formula_139

The assignment formula_140 defines a bijective formula_54-linear operator formula_142 whose inverse is the map formula_143 defined by the assignment formula_144 that sends formula_145 to the linear functional formula_146 defined by
formula_147
The real part of formula_148 is formula_149 and the bijection formula_143 is an formula_54-linear operator, meaning that formula_152 and formula_153 for all formula_154 and formula_155 
Similarly for the imaginary part, the assignment formula_156 induces an formula_54-linear bijection formula_142 whose inverse is the map formula_159 defined by sending formula_160 to the linear functional on formula_87 defined by formula_162

This relationship was discovered by Henry Löwig in 1934 (although it is usually credited to F. Murray), and can be generalized to arbitrary finite extensions of a field in the natural way. It has many important consequences, some of which will now be described.

=== Properties and relationships ===

Suppose formula_163 is a linear functional on formula_87 with real part formula_128 and imaginary part formula_129

Then formula_167 if and only if formula_168 if and only if formula_169

Assume that formula_87 is a topological vector space. Then formula_171 is continuous if and only if its real part formula_172 is continuous, if and only if formula_171&#x27;s imaginary part formula_174 is continuous. That is, either all three of formula_175 and formula_174 are continuous or none are continuous. This remains true if the word &quot;continuous&quot; is replaced with the word &quot;bounded&quot;. In particular, formula_177 if and only if formula_178 where the prime denotes the space&#x27;s continuous dual space.

Let formula_179 If formula_180 for all scalars formula_181 of unit length (meaning formula_182) then formula_183 
Similarly, if formula_184 denotes the complex part of formula_171 then formula_186 implies formula_187 
If formula_87 is a normed space with norm formula_189 and if formula_190 is the closed unit ball then the supremums above are the operator norms (defined in the usual way) of formula_175 and formula_174 so that formula_193 
This conclusion extends to the analogous statement for polars of balanced sets in general topological vector spaces.
* If formula_87 is a complex Hilbert space with a (complex) inner product formula_195 that is antilinear in its first coordinate (and linear in the second) then formula_90 becomes a real Hilbert space when endowed with the real part of formula_197 Explicitly, this real inner product on formula_90 is defined by formula_199 for all formula_200 and it induces the same norm on formula_87 as formula_195 because formula_203 for all vectors formula_204 Applying the Riesz representation theorem to formula_177 (resp. to formula_178) guarantees the existence of a unique vector formula_207 (resp. formula_208) such that formula_209 (resp. formula_210) for all vectors formula_204 The theorem also guarantees that formula_212 and formula_213 It is readily verified that formula_214 Now formula_215 and the previous equalities imply that formula_216 which is the same conclusion that was reached above.

== In infinite dimensions ==
Below, all vector spaces are over either the real numbers formula_54 or the complex numbers formula_88

If formula_219 is a topological vector space, the space of continuous linear functionals — the — is often simply called the dual space. If formula_219 is a Banach space, then so is its (continuous) dual. To distinguish the ordinary dual space from the continuous dual space, the former is sometimes called the . In finite dimensions, every linear functional is continuous, so the continuous dual is the same as the algebraic dual, but in infinite dimensions the continuous dual is a proper subspace of the algebraic dual.

A linear functional on a (not necessarily locally convex) topological vector space is continuous if and only if there exists a continuous seminorm on such that formula_221

=== Characterizing closed subspaces ===
Continuous linear functionals have nice properties for analysis: a linear functional is continuous if and only if its kernel is closed, and a non-trivial continuous linear functional is an open map, even if the (topological) vector space is not complete.

==== Hyperplanes and maximal subspaces ====

A vector subspace formula_222 of formula_87 is called maximal if formula_224 (meaning formula_225 and formula_226) and does not exist a vector subspace formula_227 of formula_87 such that formula_229 A vector subspace formula_222 of formula_87 is maximal if and only if it is the kernel of some non-trivial linear functional on formula_87 (that is, formula_233 for some linear functional formula_50 on formula_87 that is not identically ). An affine hyperplane in formula_87 is a translate of a maximal vector subspace. By linearity, a subset formula_237 of formula_87 is a affine hyperplane if and only if there exists some non-trivial linear functional formula_50 on formula_87 such that formula_241 
If formula_50 is a linear functional and formula_243 is a scalar then formula_244 This equality can be used to relate different level sets of formula_245 Moreover, if formula_246 then the kernel of formula_50 can be reconstructed from the affine hyperplane formula_248 by formula_249

==== Relationships between multiple linear functionals ====

Any two linear functionals with the same kernel are proportional (i.e. scalar multiples of each other). 
This fact can be generalized to the following theorem.

If is a non-trivial linear functional on with kernel , formula_250 satisfies formula_251 and is a balanced subset of , then formula_252 if and only if formula_253 for all formula_254

=== Hahn–Banach theorem ===
Any (algebraic) linear functional on a vector subspace can be extended to the whole space; for example, the evaluation functionals described above can be extended to the vector space of polynomials on all of formula_110 However, this extension cannot always be done while keeping the linear functional continuous. The Hahn–Banach family of theorems gives conditions under which this extension can be done. For example,

=== Equicontinuity of families of linear functionals ===
Let be a topological vector space (TVS) with continuous dual space formula_256

For any subset of formula_257 the following are equivalent: 
# is equicontinuous;
# is contained in the polar of some neighborhood of formula_103 in ;
# the (pre)polar of is a neighborhood of formula_103 in ;

If is an equicontinuous subset of formula_260 then the following sets are also equicontinuous: 
the weak-* closure, the balanced hull, the convex hull, and the convex balanced hull. 
Moreover, Alaoglu&#x27;s theorem implies that the weak-* closure of an equicontinuous subset of formula_260 is weak-* compact (and thus that every equicontinuous subset weak-* relatively compact).

<doc id="214138" wikidata="Q154111" url="?curid=214138" title="St. Anger">
<text>St. Anger is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on June 5, 2003, through Elektra Records in the United States and Vertigo Records elsewhere. It was the last Metallica album released through Elektra and the final collaboration between Metallica and longtime producer Bob Rock, with whom the band had worked since 1990. This is also Metallica&#x27;s only album as an official trio, as bassist Jason Newsted left the band prior to the recording sessions. Rock played bass in Newsted&#x27;s place, and Robert Trujillo joined the band following its completion. Although he does not play on the album, Trujillo is credited in the liner notes and appears in photos with the band in the album&#x27;s booklet.

Recording began in April 2001 but was postponed after rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield entered rehabilitation for alcoholism and various other addictions, and did not resume until May 2002. The recording is the subject of the 2004 documentary film &quot;&quot;. &quot;St. Anger&quot; departed from Metallica&#x27;s signature style with an alternative metal style, raw production, metallic drum sound, and no guitar solos. The artwork was created by frequent Metallica collaborator Pushead.

&quot;St. Anger&quot; was intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution via peer-to-peer file sharing networks. Despite mixed reviews, it debuted at the top of sales charts in 14 countries, including the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Metallica spent two years touring to promote the album. In 2004, the lead single, &quot;St. Anger&quot;, won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. &quot;St. Anger&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping two million copies in the US; it has sold nearly six million copies worldwide.

==Recording==

Metallica rented an old United States Army barracks on the Presidio of San Francisco, and converted it into a makeshift studio in January 2001.

As plans were being made to enter the studio to write and record its first album in nearly five years, the band postponed the recording because of the departure of bassist Jason Newsted on January 17, 2001, with Newsted stating his departure was due to &quot;private and personal reasons and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love&quot;. Due to the difficulty in immediately finding or auditioning for a replacement for Newsted to write and record with so close to the rescheduled sessions, Metallica accepted an offer from Bob Rock to play bass on the album in Newsted&#x27;s place, and stated they would find an official bass player upon the album&#x27;s completion. In February 2003, as &quot;St. Anger&quot; was nearing completion, Metallica hired Robert Trujillo as their new bassist. He appeared on the footage of studio rehearsals of &quot;St. Anger&quot; in its entirety, which was included on DVD in the album package.

In July 2001, recording came to a halt when James Hetfield entered rehab for alcoholism and other undisclosed addictions. Hetfield returned to the band in December 2001, but was only allowed to work on the album from noon to 4:00 PM as the band resumed recording on April 12, 2002. Due to his personal problems, as well as Metallica&#x27;s internal struggles, the band hired a personal enhancement coach, Phil Towle. This, and the recording of the album, was documented by filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky and released in 2004 as the film &quot;&quot;. From May 2002 until April 2003, the album was recorded at a new studio in San Rafael, California, known as &quot;HQ&quot;.

Hetfield stated that the album was written with &quot;a lot of passion&quot;. He said, &quot;There&#x27;s two years of condensed emotion in this. We&#x27;ve gone through a lot of personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it&#x27;s deep. It&#x27;s so deep lyrically and musically. [&quot;St. Anger&quot;] is just the best that it can be from us right now.&quot; The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album, so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt and did not want to &quot;mess with it&quot;. Rock commented, &quot;I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn&#x27;t do what everyone does and what I&#x27;ve been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it.&quot; The album represented Bob Rock&#x27;s first ever all-digital project, even though analogue was used for mastering, he said: &quot;The digital just sounded good,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was so raw and in-your-face, and the guys really loved it. Kirk didn&#x27;t want to go back to analogue and soften the guitars. If you stood in front of his amp, that sound was coming through an NS10, and if you go into your car and listen, it still sounds the same. It sounds like you&#x27;re right in front of his speaker cabinet. Good or bad, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re hearing, and he loved that, so we wanted to retain it.&quot; With the guitars recorded in Drop C tuning, with the exceptions of &quot;Dirty Window&quot;, &quot;Invisible Kid&quot; and &quot;The Unnamed Feeling&quot;, in drop C#, G# and A#, respectively, &quot;St. Anger&quot; is seen as a departure from the band&#x27;s previous work, described as alternative metal and nu metal. The album also uses strong elements of groove metal and speed metal.

Guitarist Kirk Hammett commented on the lack of guitar solos on &quot;St. Anger&quot;, a departure for Metallica: &quot;We wanted to preserve the sound of all four of us in a room just jamming. We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought.&quot; Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, &quot;We made a promise to ourselves that we&#x27;d only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn&#x27;t want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs.&quot; Lars Ulrich recorded his drums with the wires turned off on his snare drum, resulting in a drum tone with far more &quot;ring&quot; than is usual in rock. Ulrich said, &quot;One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn&#x27;t thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, I decided I was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back to me in a beautiful way.&quot; Rock said the group spent only &quot;15 minutes&quot; on the drum sound, with fewer microphones than usual.

==Artwork==
Brian Schroeder designed the album cover and interior artwork for &quot;St. Anger&quot;. Schroeder has designed a number of items for Metallica in the past, including liner artwork of &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, several single covers, and many T-shirts; however, the album marks his first studio album cover art for the band. Originally, according to Metallica&#x27;s official website, four different limited color variations of the cover were planned, but the idea was eventually scrapped.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;St. Anger&quot; was released on June 5, 2003. It was originally scheduled for June 10, but due to Metallica&#x27;s previous battle with Napster and fear that it would be released illegally onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks, the band pushed the release date ahead by five days. A special edition of the album was released with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals of all of the &quot;St. Anger&quot; tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world. In 2004, Metallica won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, for the title track.
After &quot;St. Anger&quot;″s release, Metallica embarked on a tour that lasted nearly two years. The first leg was the U.S. 2003 Summer Sanitarium Tour with support from Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Linkin Park, and Mudvayne. After &quot;Summer Sanitarium&quot;, the band began the Madly in Anger with the World Tour with support from Godsmack, Lostprophets, and Slipknot (both on certain European dates), which lasted until late 2004. The &quot;St. Anger&quot; songs &quot;Frantic&quot;, &quot;St. Anger&quot;, &quot;Dirty Window&quot; and &quot;The Unnamed Feeling&quot; were performed frequently during the tour. &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot; was also played live, but not as often as other songs on the album, and “Sweet Amber” was played only once. The album tracks were altered when played live; sometimes they were shortened, or in some cases a guitar solo was added. Sometimes, only one song from the album was played live.

By 2009, the songs from &quot;St. Anger&quot; were completely absent from Metallica&#x27;s set lists. After &quot;Frantic&quot; was performed on October 21, 2008, songs from the album would entirely disappear from set lists on major tours, although it and &quot;Dirty Window&quot; were performed again on December 10, 2011, during the last concert of Metallica&#x27;s special and private 30th Anniversary Tour, in San Francisco, California. &quot;St. Anger&quot; was also played again during the &quot;Metallica by Request&quot; tour in 2014 when it was voted by the fans, and also occasionally during concerts in 2014 and 2015. In October 2007, &quot;All Within My Hands&quot; was performed live for the first time, albeit rearranged and acoustically, at both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concerts; it would be performed similarly in November 2018 at the AWMH Foundation&#x27;s Helping Hands concert in San Francisco, and again in September 2019 during the S&amp;M 2 concert, also in San Francisco. On May 1, 2019, &quot;Frantic&quot; was performed on the WorldWired Tour in Lisbon, Portugal after many years of absence. It and the title track would be performed regularly on this leg of the tour. “Frantic” and “Dirty Window” were played during the 40th Anniversary shows in San Francisco in December 2021.

Metallica also released four singles from &quot;St. Anger&quot;. The order of the releases was: &quot;St. Anger&quot;, &quot;Frantic&quot;, &quot;The Unnamed Feeling&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot;. On the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart, these singles charted at number 2, number 21, number 28 and number 18, respectively. Promotional music videos were also made for all four of the songs. These videos can be found on Metallica&#x27;s DVD video collection, titled &quot;The Videos 1989-2004&quot;, and the video for &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot; can also be found on the film &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;St. Anger&quot; received polarized reviews from critics; the album holds a score of 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, on review-aggregating website Metacritic. Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted positive and negative aspects of the album, saying, &quot;While it&#x27;s an ungodly mess at times, what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion for the first time in years.&quot; Talking about the album, Greg Kot of &quot;Blender&quot; said, &quot;It may be too late to rehabilitate Metallica&#x27;s image, but once again, their music is all about bringing the carnage.&quot; Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Ian Watson said that, &quot;the songs are a stripped back, heroically brutal reflection of this fury. You get the sense that, as with their emotional selves, they&#x27;ve taken metal apart and started again from scratch. There&#x27;s no space wasted here, no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery, just a focused, relentless attack.&quot; Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a &quot;punishing, unflinching document of internal struggle—taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica, but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield&#x27;s brain. &quot;St. Anger&quot; is an immediate record.&quot; Barry Walter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken on &quot;St. Anger&quot;, stating: &quot;No wonder there&#x27;s an authenticity to &quot;St. Anger&quot;″s fury that none of the band&#x27;s rap-metal followers can touch.&quot; He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums, continuing: &quot;There&#x27;s no radio-size, four-minute rock here, no pop-friendly choruses, no ballads, no solos, no wayward experimentation.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; marked &quot;St. Anger&quot; as number 43 on their list of 50 horrible albums by brilliant artists, calling it &quot;a deeply disappointing album&quot;.

Although some reviews of &quot;St. Anger&quot; were positive, other reviewers had a strong distaste for the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; criticized Ulrich and Hammett, saying that Ulrich was &quot;playing a drum set consisting of steel drums, aluminum toms, programmed double kicks, and a broken church bell. The kit&#x27;s high-end clamor ignored the basic principles of drumming: timekeeping,&quot; he added, &quot;Hetfield and Hammett&#x27;s guitars underwent more processing than cat food. When they both speedstrummed through &quot;St. Anger&quot;, and most other movements, [Hetfield and Hammett] seemed to overwhelm each other with different, terrible noise. Also the duration of most songs made it boring to hear them.&quot; Phil Freeman of &quot;Houston Press&quot; characterized the album as having, &quot;stolen Helmet riffs and lyrics that sound co-written by Hetfield&#x27;s AA sponsor.&quot; Playlouder reviewer William Luff cited the album&#x27;s 75-minute length and sound (&quot;a monolithic slab of noise&quot;) as reasoning that &quot;St. Anger&quot; was &quot;just too dense and daunting to be truly enjoyable.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; reporter Michael Christopher said &quot;&quot;St. Anger&quot; dispenses with the recent spate of radio friendly pleasantries in favor of pedal to the floor thrash, staggered and extended song structures, quick changes and a muddled production that tries to harken back to the &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; days. All attempts fail miserably.&quot;

The album&#x27;s snare drum sound was widely criticized. Ulrich dismissed the criticism as &quot;closed-minded&quot;, and in July 2020 he said, &quot;I stand behind it 100% because, at that moment, that was the truth&quot;. In 2017, Hetfield said, &quot;There are things I would like to change on some of the records, but it gives them so much character that you can’t change them ... &quot;St. Anger&quot; could use a little less tin snare drum, but those things are what make those records part of our history.&quot;

<text>Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a type of astronomical interferometry used in radio astronomy. In VLBI a signal from an astronomical radio source, such as a quasar, is collected at multiple radio telescopes on Earth or in space. The distance between the radio telescopes is then calculated using the time difference between the arrivals of the radio signal at different telescopes. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many radio telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.

Data received at each antenna in the array include arrival times from a local atomic clock, such as a hydrogen maser. At a later time, the data are correlated with data from other antennas that recorded the same radio signal, to produce the resulting image. The resolution achievable using interferometry is proportional to the observing frequency. The VLBI technique enables the distance between telescopes to be much greater than that possible with conventional interferometry, which requires antennas to be physically connected by coaxial cable, waveguide, optical fiber, or other type of transmission line. The greater telescope separations are possible in VLBI due to the development of the closure phase imaging technique by Roger Jennison in the 1950s, allowing VLBI to produce images with superior resolution.

VLBI is best known for imaging distant cosmic radio sources, spacecraft tracking, and for applications in astrometry. However, since the VLBI technique measures the time differences between the arrival of radio waves at separate antennas, it can also be used &quot;in reverse&quot; to perform Earth rotation studies, map movements of tectonic plates very precisely (within millimetres), and perform other types of geodesy. Using VLBI in this manner requires large numbers of time difference measurements from distant sources (such as quasars) observed with a global network of antennas over a period of time.

== Method ==
In VLBI, the digitized antenna data are usually recorded at each of the telescopes (in the past this was done on large magnetic tapes, but nowadays it is usually done on large arrays of computer disk drives). The antenna signal is sampled with an extremely precise and stable atomic clock (usually a hydrogen maser) that is additionally locked onto a GPS time standard. Alongside the astronomical data samples, the output of this clock is recorded. The recorded media are then transported to a central location. More recent experiments have been conducted with &quot;electronic&quot; VLBI (e-VLBI) where the data are sent by fibre-optics (e.g., 10 Gbit/s fiber-optic paths in the European GEANT2 research network) and not recorded at the telescopes, speeding up and simplifying the observing process significantly. Even though the data rates are very high, the data can be sent over normal Internet connections taking advantage of the fact that many of the international high speed networks have significant spare capacity at present.

At the location of the correlator, the data is played back. The timing of the playback is adjusted according to the atomic clock signals, and the estimated times of arrival of the radio signal at each of the telescopes. A range of playback timings over a range of nanoseconds are usually tested until the correct timing is found.

Each antenna will be a different distance from the radio source, and as with the short baseline radio interferometer the delays incurred by the extra distance to one antenna must be added artificially to the signals received at each of the other antennas. The approximate delay required can be calculated from the geometry of the problem. The tape playback is synchronized using the recorded signals from the atomic clocks as time references, as shown in the drawing on the right. If the position of the antennas is not known to sufficient accuracy or atmospheric effects are significant, fine adjustments to the delays must be made until interference fringes are detected. If the signal from antenna A is taken as the reference, inaccuracies in the delay will lead to errors formula_1 and formula_2 in the phases of the signals from tapes B and C respectively (see drawing on right). As a result of these errors the phase of the complex visibility cannot be measured with a very-long-baseline interferometer.

Temperature variations at VLBI sites can deform the structure of the antennas and affect the baseline measurements. Neglecting atmospheric pressure and hydrological loading corrections at the observation level can also contaminate the VLBI measurements by introducing annual and seasonal signals, like in the Global Navigation Satellite System time series.

The phase of the complex visibility depends on the symmetry of the source brightness distribution. Any brightness distribution can be written as the sum of a symmetric component and an anti-symmetric component. The symmetric component of the brightness distribution only contributes to the real part of the complex visibility, while the anti-symmetric component only contributes to the imaginary part. As the phase of each complex visibility measurement cannot be determined with a very-long-baseline interferometer the symmetry of the corresponding contribution to the source brightness distributions is not known.

Roger Clifton Jennison developed a novel technique for obtaining information about visibility phases when delay errors are present, using an observable called the closure phase. Although his initial laboratory measurements of closure phase had been done at optical wavelengths, he foresaw greater potential for his technique in radio interferometry. In 1958 he demonstrated its effectiveness with a radio interferometer, but it only became widely used for long-baseline radio interferometry in 1974. At least three antennas are required. This method was used for the first VLBI measurements, and a modified form of this approach (&quot;Self-Calibration&quot;) is still used today.

== Scientific results ==

Some of the scientific results derived from VLBI include:

*High resolution radio imaging of cosmic radio sources.
*Imaging the surfaces of nearby stars at radio wavelengths (see also interferometry) – similar techniques have also been used to make infrared and optical images of stellar surfaces.
*Definition of the celestial reference frame.
*Measurement of the acceleration of the Solar System toward the center of the Milky Way.
*Motion of the Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates.
*Regional deformation and local uplift or subsidence.
*Earth&#x27;s orientation parameters and fluctuations in the length of day.
*Maintenance of the terrestrial reference frame.
*Measurement of gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon on the Earth and the deep structure of the Earth.
*Improvement of atmospheric models.
*Measurement of the fundamental speed of gravity.
*The tracking of the Huygens probe as it passed through Titan&#x27;s atmosphere, allowing wind velocity measurements.
*First imaging of a supermassive black hole.

== VLBI arrays ==
There are several VLBI arrays located in Europe, Canada, the United States, Chile, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Australia and Thailand. The most sensitive VLBI array in the world is the European VLBI Network (EVN). This is a part-time array that brings together the largest European radiotelescopes and some others outside of Europe for typically weeklong sessions, with the data being processed at the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE). The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), which uses ten dedicated, 25-meter telescopes spanning 5351 miles across the United States, is the largest VLBI array that operates all year round as both an astronomical and geodesy instrument. The combination of the EVN and VLBA is known as Global VLBI. When one or both of these arrays are combined with space-based VLBI antennas such as HALCA or Spektr-R, the resolution obtained is higher than any other astronomical instrument, capable of imaging the sky with a level of detail measured in microarcseconds. VLBI generally benefits from the longer baselines afforded by international collaboration, with a notable early example in 1976, when radio telescopes in the United States, USSR and Australia were linked to observe hydroxyl-maser sources. This technique is currently being used by the Event Horizon Telescope, whose goal is to observe the supermassive black holes at the centers of the Milky Way Galaxy and Messier 87.
NASAs Deep Space Network uses its larger antennas (normally used for spacecraft communication) for VLBI, in order to construct radio reference frames for the purpose of spacecraft navigation. The inclusion of the ESA station at Malargue, Argentina, adds baselines that allow much better coverage of the southern hemisphere.

== e-VLBI == 
VLBI has traditionally operated by recording the signal at each telescope on magnetic tapes or disks, and shipping those to the correlation center for replay. In 2004 it became possible to connect VLBI radio telescopes in close to real-time, while still employing the local time references of the VLBI technique, in a technique known as e-VLBI. In Europe, six radio telescopes of the European VLBI Network (EVN) were connected with Gigabit per second links via their National Research Networks and the Pan-European research network GEANT2, and the first astronomical experiments using this new technique were successfully conducted.

The image to the right shows the first science produced by the European VLBI Network using e-VLBI. The data from each of the telescopes were routed through the GÉANT2 network and on through SURFnet to be the processed in real time at the European Data Processing centre at JIVE.

== Space VLBI ==
In the quest for even greater angular resolution, dedicated VLBI satellites have been placed in Earth orbit to provide greatly extended baselines. Experiments incorporating such space-borne array elements are termed Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (SVLBI). The first SVLBI experiment was carried out on Salyut-6 orbital station with KRT-10, a 10-meter radio telescope, which was launched in July 1978.

The first dedicated SVLBI satellite was HALCA, an 8-meter radio telescope, which was launched in February 1997 and made observations until October 2003. Due to the small size of the dish, only very strong radio sources could be observed with SVLBI arrays incorporating it.

Another SVLBI satellite, a 10-meter radio telescope Spektr-R, was launched in July 2011 and made observations until January 2019. It was placed into a highly elliptical orbit, ranging from a perigee of 10,652 km to an apogee of 338,541 km, making RadioAstron, the SVLBI program incorporating the satellite and ground arrays, the biggest radio interferometer to date. The resolution of the system reached 8 microarcseconds.

==International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry==
The International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) is an international collaboration whose purpose is to use the observation of astronomical radio sources using VLBI to precisely determine earth orientation parameters (EOP) and celestial reference frames (CRF) and terrestrial reference frames (TRF). IVS is a service operating under the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the International Association of Geodesy (IAG).

<text>Bulletproof Monk is a 2003 American action comedy film directed by Paul Hunter in his feature film directorial debut, and starring Chow Yun-fat, Seann William Scott, and Jaime King. The film is loosely based on the comic book written by Brett Lewis with art by Michael Avon Oeming. The film was shot in Toronto and Hamilton, Canada, and other locations that resemble New York City. It received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure, earning $37 million worldwide on the budget of $52 million.

== Plot ==
In 1943 Tibet, a young monk is told that he has fulfilled a series of prophecies that mark him as his master&#x27;s successor. Forgoing his name, the monk is entrusted with guarding a scroll with the power to keep its owner powerful, young, and immune to injury. The monk is forced to flee when Nazi soldiers, led by Colonel Strucker, siege the temple. Sixty years later, the nameless monk encounters and begins tailing a young pickpocket named Kar, suspecting he may make for a suitable successor based on his selfless nature. During a violent run-in with a local gang, Kar falls for a roguish young woman named Jade.

The following day, Jade attends an exhibition at a human rights museum presided over by Strucker&#x27;s granddaughter, Nina, who secretly and ruthlessly spearheads her grandfather&#x27;s ongoing hunt for the scroll. Afterwards, Jade chances upon Kar being lectured by the monk and asks him to return her necklace, which he had stolen to earn her esteem. The meeting is interrupted when the monk is spotted by Nina&#x27;s mercenaries. With Kar, the monk arrives at a laundromat that secretly houses a group of monks who provide him shelter, and the monk offers to train him.

As Kar and the monk train in an abandoned warehouse, Nina&#x27;s mercenaries come down on them in force. In the ensuing chase, Kar accidentally drops the scroll from the rooftop, where it is swiped by Nina; however, she later discovers the scroll is a fake. Angered, Nina visits Kar&#x27;s home to track the pair down, murdering his employer. An ambitious monk then betrays the location of their hideout to Nina, forcing the pair to flee once again. The monk&#x27;s allies are kidnapped and taken to Strucker&#x27;s secret facility beneath the museum.

Seeking help, Kar and the monk visit Jade at her home, learning that she is the daughter of an imprisoned crime lord. The monk realizes that this fact has fulfilled the second prophecy. Suddenly, Nina and her men burst through Jade&#x27;s windows in a surprise attack, knocking the monk out with a tranquilizer dart. Nina discovers that the scroll&#x27;s true text is tattooed onto the monk&#x27;s body and orders that he be taken alive. Jade surmises where the monk was taken and chooses to help rescue him, intent on making Nina pay for her crimes.

The monk awakens to Nina sensually undressing him and scanning his tattoos, compiling the scroll&#x27;s text into her grandfather&#x27;s computer. Strucker&#x27;s reading is interrupted when Jade and Kar launch an explosive attack on the museum, killing most of Nina&#x27;s men in the blast. Jade and Kar infiltrate the facility through an underground water main, where Kar is swept away by a sudden rush of water. Jade is intercepted in the tunnels by Nina, this time dressed in a tight military-style jumpsuit and concealing a sai. Despite Nina&#x27;s initial advantage, Jade manages to incapacitate her with a kick to the leg, breaking her shin. Jade pulls the defeated Nina into a chokehold and snaps her neck, finishing her off for good.

Strucker regains his youth after reading from the scroll; however, he finds that the last verse is missing. Before Strucker can scan the monk&#x27;s brain for it, Kar arrives and distracts him, allowing the monk to break free. While Jade works to free the other monks, the nameless monk fights Strucker alongside Kar, eventually sending him plummeting off the roof. The three reunite inside the museum and the power of the scroll transfers to Kar, as he has fulfilled the third prophecy. Strucker reappears and attempts to kill the three, but is killed himself by a falling statue. Kar is surprised to find Jade alive after seemingly being shot; like Kar, she also fulfilled the three prophecies, and the scroll&#x27;s power transferred to her as well. The monk, now aged, meets with Kar and Jade the next day, giving each one half of the final verse, deeming them inseparable. The pair wish him a good vacation from his duties before departing to fulfill their new roles.

== Production ==
In May 2000, it was announced MGM had paid high six figures against a potential seven-figure deal to turn the cult comic &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; into a live-action film that would star Chow Yun-fat as the title character with John Woo and Terence Chang’s Lion Rock Productions producing. Seann William Scott was cast in November 2001.

A video game adaptation was in development by Mucky Foot Productions for Empire Interactive but it was cancelled.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The film grossed approximately $23 million in the United States, with a worldwide total of $37 million, less than the production budget of $52 million.

=== Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Venerable action star Chow Yun-Fat is the only saving grace in this silly action flick that more often than not resembles a commercial in style.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 40% based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2 out of 4 stars and wrote: &quot;The fight scenes in Bulletproof Monk are not as inventive as some I&#x27;ve seen (although the opening fight on a rope bridge is so well done that it raises expectations it cannot fulfill).&quot; Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;adults will likely object to the innumerable plot question marks coming off the screen like so many kung-fu kicks to the head.&quot; Koehler compared the film to Hong Kong action movies, noting that the fights are relatively tame, but the visual effects are generally excellent. Jamie Russell at the BBC gave it 3/5 stars and called it &quot;Truly naff, but endearingly silly.&quot;

David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; contended that &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; was &quot;&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; for the &quot;American Pie&quot; audience&quot;; panning its poor special effects and cinematography (the former he compared to an &quot;afternoon Japanese kiddie series&quot;), and concluded that &quot;they made a ton of junky movies in Hong Kong, but those were dazzlingly fluid and high-flying junky movies. This American retread has the same sort of hack plot but none of the bravura. It makes them look like monkeys, and not bulletproof ones.&quot; Bill Stamets of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; panned &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; for having &quot;routine&quot; fight scenes and juvenile humor, and that &quot;the film plays off Chow&#x27;s imperturbable persona, but the Tibetan philosophy boils down to the paradox of hot dogs coming ten to a package while buns are sold in sets of eight.&quot;

<text>Stepan Timofeyevich Razin (, ; c. 1630 – ), known as Stenka Razin ( ), was a Don Cossack leader who led a major uprising against the nobility and tsarist bureaucracy in southern Russia in 1670–1671.

==Early life==

Razin&#x27;s father, Timofey Razya, supposedly came from a suburb of Voronezh, a city near Russia&#x27;s steppe frontier, called the Wild Fields. Razin&#x27;s uncle and grandmother still lived in the village of &quot;New Usman&quot;&#x27; or &quot;Usman&#x27; Sobakina&quot;, outside of Voronezh, until 1667. The identity of Razin&#x27;s mother is debated. In one document, Razin was referred to as a &quot;tuma Cossack&quot; which means &quot;half-blood&quot;, leading to a hypothesis that his mother was a captured &quot;Turkish&quot; (&quot;turchanka&quot;) or Crimean Tatar woman. However, this term was also used by &quot;upper Cossacks&quot; as a derogatory nickname towards all &quot;lower Cossacks&quot; regardless of origin. Another hypothesis draws on information about Razin&#x27;s godmother Matrena Govorukha. According to tradition, a godmother should be related to a birthmother, and Stenka&#x27;s godmother lived in the town of .

Razin was first mentioned in historical sources in 1652, when he asked for permission to go on a long-distance pilgrimage to the great Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea. In 1661, he was mentioned as part of a diplomatic mission from the Don Cossacks to the Kalmyks. After that, all trace of him was lost for six years, after which he reappeared as the leader of a robber community established at Panshinskoye, among the marshes between the Tishina and Ilovlya rivers, whence he levied tribute from all vessels passing up and down the Volga. In 1665, his elder brother, Ivan, was executed by order of for unauthorized desertion from the war with the Poles.

Protracted wars with Poland in 1654–1667 and the Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658) put a heavy burden upon the people of Russia. Taxes increased, as did conscription. Many peasants, hoping to escape these burdens, fled south and joined Razin&#x27;s bands of Cossacks. They were also joined by many others who were disaffected with the Russian government, including people of the lower classes, as well as representatives of non-Russian ethnic groups such as Kalmyks, that were being oppressed at the time.

Razin&#x27;s first notable exploit was to destroy the great naval convoy consisting of the treasury barges and the barges of the Patriarch and the wealthy merchants of Moscow. Razin then sailed down the Volga with a fleet of 35 vessels, capturing the more important forts on his way and devastating the country. At the beginning of 1668, he defeated the voivode Yakov Bezobrazov, sent against him from Astrakhan, and in the spring embarked on a predatory expedition into Daghestan and Persia, which lasted for eighteen months.

==Background==
The Time of Troubles, which lasted from 1598 to 1613, had proven a difficult period for Russia. The direct male line of Rurik dynasty tsars died out in 1598, and the rule of the Romanov dynasty (which would eventually end with the February Revolution of 1917) began only in 1613. The reigns of Michael Romanov (tsar from 1613 to 1645) and of his son Alexis (tsar from 1645 to 1676) saw a strengthening of the power of the tsar with a view to stabilizing the Russian lands after the turmoil of the Time of Troubles. As a result, the Zemsky Sobor and the boyar council, two other bodies of government in Russia, slowly lost influence. The Russian population went from fifteen years of &quot;near anarchy&quot; to the reigns of strong, centralizing autocrats.

In addition, a deep divide existed between the peasantry and the nobility in Russia. Changes in the treatment and legal standing of peasants, including the institutionalization of serfdom with the Law Code of 1649, contributed to unrest among the peasantry. The Don Cossacks, a largely lower-class group which lived independently near the Don River and which the tsar&#x27;s government subsidized in exchange for defending Russia&#x27;s southern borders, led Razin&#x27;s rebellion. Historian Paul Avrich characterizes Razin&#x27;s revolt as a &quot;curious mixture of brigandage and revolt&quot;, similar to other popular uprisings of the period. Razin revolted against the &quot;traitor-boyars&quot; rather than against the tsar. Cossacks supported the tsar in that they worked for him as contracted military forces - just as they had previously served the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==Departure from the Don==

In 1667, Razin gathered a small group of Cossacks and left the Don for an expedition in the Caspian Sea. He aimed to set up a base in Yaitsk (now known as Oral, located in Kazakhstan on the Ural River) and plunder villages from there. However, Moscow learned of Razin&#x27;s plans and attempted to stop him. As Razin traveled down the Volga River to Tsaritsyn, the voivodes of Astrakhan warned Andrei Unkovsky (the voivode or governor of Tsaritsyn) of Razin&#x27;s arrival and recommended that he not allow the Cossacks to enter the town.

Unkovsky attempted to negotiate with Razin, but Razin threatened to set fire to Tsaritsyn if Unkovsky interfered. When he encountered a group of political prisoners being transported by the tsar&#x27;s representatives on his way from the Don to the Volga, Razin reportedly said, &quot;I shall not force you to join me, but whoever chooses to come with me will be a free Cossack. I have come to fight only the boyars and the wealthy lords. As for the poor and common folk, I shall treat them as brothers.&quot;

When Razin sailed by Tsartisyn, Unkovsky did not attack (possibly either because he felt that Razin posed a threat or because the guards of Tsaritsyn sympathized with Razin&#x27;s Cossacks). This incident gave Razin the reputation of an &quot;invincible warrior endowed with supernatural powers.&quot; He continued his travels down the Volga and into the Caspian Sea, defeating several detachments of streltsy, or musketeers. In July 1667, Razin captured Yaitsk by disguising himself and some of his companions as pilgrims to pray at the cathedral. Once inside Yaitsk, they opened the gates for the rest of the troops to enter and occupy the city. The opposition sent to fight Razin felt reluctant to do so because they sympathized with the Cossacks.

In the spring of 1668, Razin led the majority of his men down the Yaik River (also known as the Ural River) while a small portion stayed behind to guard Yaitsk. However, the government defeated Razin&#x27;s men in Yaitsk and Razin lost his base there.

==Persian expedition==
After losing Yaitsk, Razin sailed south down the coast of the Caspian Sea to continue his pillaging. He and his men then attacked Persia. Failing to capture the well-defended fortress port of Derbent in present-day Dagestan, his forces moved south to attack the small port of Badkuba (present Baku) located on the Absheron Peninsula in present-day Azerbaijan, but at Rasht (in the southwest Caspian Sea in modern Iran) the Persians killed roughly 400 Cossacks in a surprise attack. Razin went to Isfahan to ask the shah for land in Persia in exchange for loyalty to the shah, but departed on the Caspian for more pillaging before they could reach an agreement. Razin arrived in Farahabad (on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea in Iran) and masqueraded as a merchant in the city for several days before he and his men pillaged the city for two days. That winter the Cossacks with Razin fended off starvation and disease on the Miankaleh Peninsula, and in the spring of 1669 Razin built a base on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea and began raiding Turkmen villages. Then in the spring of 1669 he established himself on the isle of Suina, off which, in July, he annihilated a Persian fleet sent against him. Stenka Razin, as he was generally called, had now become a potentate with whom princes did not disdain to treat.

In August 1669, he reappeared at Astrakhan and accepted a fresh offer of pardon from Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich there; the common people were fascinated by his adventures. The lawless Russian border region of Astrakhan, where the whole atmosphere was predatory and many people were still nomadic, was the natural milieu for such a rebellion as Razin&#x27;s.

==Open rebellion==
In 1670, Razin, while ostensibly on his way to report at the Cossack headquarters on the Don, openly rebelled against the government, capturing Cherkassk and Tsaritsyn. After taking Tsaritsyn, Razin sailed down the Volga with his army of almost 7,000 men. The men traveled toward Cherny Yar, a government stronghold between Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan. Razin and his men swiftly took Cherny Yar when the Cherny Yar streltsy rose up against their officers and joined the Cossack cause in June 1670. On 24 June Razin reached the city of Astrakhan. Astrakhan, Russia&#x27;s wealthy &quot;window on the East&quot;, occupied a strategically important location at the mouth of the Volga River on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Razin plundered the city - despite its location on a strongly fortified island and the stone walls and brass cannons that surrounded the central citadel. The local rebellion of the streltsy allowed Razin to gain access to the city.

After massacring all who opposed him (including two Princes Prozorovsky) and giving the rich bazaars of the city over to pillage, Razin converted Astrakhan into a Cossack republic, dividing the population into thousands, hundreds, and tens, with their proper officers, all of whom were appointed by a veche or general assembly, whose first act was to proclaim Razin their &quot;gosudar&quot; (sovereign).

After a three-week carnival of blood and debauchery, Razin quit Astrakhan with two hundred barges full of troops. He intended to establish a Cossack republic along the whole length of the Volga as a preliminary step towards advancing against Moscow. Saratov and Samara were captured, but Simbirsk defied all efforts, and after two bloody encounters close at hand on the banks of the Sviyaga River ( 1 and 4 October), Razin was ultimately routed by the army of Yuri Baryatinsky and fled down the Volga, leaving the bulk of his followers to be extirpated by the victors.

But the rebellion was by no means over. The emissaries of Razin, armed with inflammatory proclamations, had stirred up the inhabitants of what became the governorates of Nizhny Novgorod, Tambov, and Penza, and penetrated even as far as Moscow and Novgorod. It was not difficult to stir the oppressed population to revolt by promising deliverance from their yoke. Razin proclaimed that his object was to root out the boyars and all officials, to level all ranks and dignities, and establish Cossackdom, with its corollary of absolute equality, throughout Russia. 
Even at the beginning of 1671 the outcome of the struggle remained in doubt. Eight battles had been fought before the insurrection showed signs of weakening, and it continued for six months after Razin had received his quietus. At Simbirsk his prestige had been shattered. Even his own settlements at Saratov and Samara refused to open their gates to him, and the Don Cossacks, hearing that the Patriarch had anathematized Razin, also declared against him. The tsar sent troops to suppress the revolt. As Paul Avrich notes in &quot;Russian Rebels, 1600–1800&quot;, &quot;The brutality of the repressions by far exceeded the atrocities committed by the insurgents.&quot; The tsar&#x27;s troops mutilated the rebels&#x27; bodies and displayed them in public to serve as a warning to potential dissenters.

In 1671, Stepan and his brother were captured at Kagalnik Fortress (Кагальницкий городок) by Cossack elders. They were given over to Tsarist officials in Moscow, and on 16 June 1671, following the announcement of the verdict against him, Stepan Razin was quartered on the scaffold on Red Square. A sentence of death was read aloud: Razin listened to this calmly, then turned to the church, bowed in three directions, passing the Kremlin and the tsar and said: &quot;Forgive me.&quot; The executioner then proceeded to first cut off his right hand to his elbow, then his left foot to the knee. His brother Frol, witnessing Stepan&#x27;s torment, shouted out: &quot;I know the word and the matter of the sovereign!&quot; (that is, &quot;I am willing to inform upon those disloyal to the tsar&quot;). Stepan shouted back, &quot;Shut up, dog!&quot; These were his last words; after them the executioner hurriedly cut off his head. Razin&#x27;s hands, legs, and head, according to the testimony of the Englishman Thomas Hebdon, were stuck on five specially-placed stakes. The confession helped Frol to postpone his own execution, although five years later, in 1676, he was executed too.

==Implications==
Razin originally set out to loot villages, but as he became a symbol of peasant unrest, his movement turned political. Razin wanted to protect the independence of the Cossacks and to protest an increasingly centralized government. The Cossacks supported the tsar and autocracy, but they wanted a tsar that responded to the needs of the people and not just those of the upper class. By destroying and pillaging villages, Razin intended to take power from the government officials and give more autonomy to the peasants. However, Razin&#x27;s movement failed and the rebellion led to increased government control. The Cossacks lost some of their autonomy, and the tsar bonded more closely with the upper class because both feared more rebellion. On the other hand, as Avrich asserts, &quot;[Razin&#x27;s revolt] awakened, however dimly, the social consciousness of the poor, gave them a new sense of power, and made the upper class tremble for their lives and possessions.&quot;

At the time of the Russian Civil War, the famous writer and White emigre Ivan Bunin compared Razin to Bolshevik leaders, writing &quot;Good God! What striking similarity there is between the time of Sten&#x27;ka and the pillaging that is going on today in the name of the &#x27;Third International&#x27;.&quot;

==In Russian-language culture and folklore==
===Razin and the &quot;Persian princess&quot;===
One of the most popular cultural motifs associated with Razin is the episode with the drowning of the &quot;Persian princess&quot; in the river. Modern historians doubt the reality of this episode. There are two reports of foreigners who ended up in Astrakhan during the uprising. One of the testimonies is from the memoirs of the Dutch traveler Jan Struis. This testimony is much more famous: it was widely used by Russian historians and it served as the basis for the plot of the song &quot;Stenka Razin&quot;. The other is the notes of the Dutchman Ludwig Fabricius, which became known only after the Second World War. In the first, a Persian princess appears, drowned in the Volga; in the second, a certain &quot;Tatar maiden&quot; drowned in the Yaik River. Streis conveys the story as drunken cruelty, and Fabricius as the fulfillment of the oath that Razin made to a certain &quot;water god&quot; &quot;Ivan Gorinovich&quot;, who controls the Yaik River: Razin promised that as a reward for good luck he would give this &quot;god&quot; the best he has.

===Stenka Razin song===
In 1883, the Russian poet Dmitry Sadovnikov published the poem &quot;Stenka Razin&quot;, which he, as was customary, presented as a &quot;folk epic&quot;. The text of this poem, with minor changes, was set to music by an unknown author and became extremely popular, and was performed by many famous singers. The song recounts that Razin aboard his ship marries the captured &quot;Persian princess&quot; and his men accuse him of weakness — spending &quot;one short night&quot; with a woman — and that he himself has become a &quot;woman&quot; the next morning. Hearing these speeches, Razin throws the &quot;princess&quot; into the water as a gift to the Volga river, and continues the drunken fun with his men.

The lyrics of the song were dramatized in one of the first Russian narrative films, &quot;Stenka Razin&quot; directed by Vladimir Romashkov in 1908. The film lasts about 10 minutes. The screenplay was written by Vasily Goncharov, and the music (the first film music to be specially written to accompany a silent film) was by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov.

The song was included in early radio broadcasts in 1923, designed to introduce the new medium to peasant communities. An account of this was given by Charles Ashleigh who visited a training college for electrical engineers located in Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius.

The popular song is known by the words &quot;Volga, Volga mat&#x27; rodnaya&quot;, &quot;Iz za ostrova na strezhen&quot;, and, simply, &quot;Stenka Razin&quot;. The song gave the title to the famous Soviet musical comedy &quot;Volga-Volga&quot;. The melody was used by Tom Springfield in the song &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; that placed The Seekers at No. 1 in 1965 in Australia and the UK.

A version of this song is also performed by Doukhobors in Canada.

Razin is the subject of a symphonic poem by Alexander Glazunov (Op 13 1885), Symphony no. 8 by Myaskovsky (op. 26, 1925), a cantata by Shostakovich, op. 119; &quot;The Execution of Stepan Razin&quot; (1964), a poem by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and a novel, &quot;&quot;, (Я пришёл дать вам волю) by Vasily Shukshin.

In 1965, the Red Army Choir, with the soloist Leonid Kharitonov, performed the Russian folk song &quot;The Cliff&quot;, which praises Razin for being the only man that was able to climb up to the top of the horrible cliff.

Beside that, Razin was glorified in the Soviet drama film of 1939 directed by Ivan Pravov and Olga Preobrazhenskaya.

In 1972 Monument to Stepan Razin has been installed in Rostov-on-Don.

One of his atamans, Alena Arzamasskaia, was a former nun.

Razin is the subject of the Landmark book &quot;Chief of the Cossacks&quot;.

<text>The Philadelphia Folk Festival is a folk music festival held annually at Old Pool Farm in Upper Salford, Pennsylvania, just outside of Philadelphia. 

The four-night, three-day festival is produced and run by the non-profit Philadelphia Folksong Society and staffed almost entirely by volunteers.

The event hosts contemporary and traditional artists in genres under the umbrella of Folk, including World/Fusion, Celtic, Singer/Songwriter, Folk Rock, Country, Klezmer, Blues, Bluegrass, Hip/Hop, Spoken Word, Storytelling, and Dance. 

Each year the event hosts over 35,000 visitors and nearly 7,000 campers at the Old Pool Farm. The event presents over 75 hours of music with local, regional, and national talent on its stages.

The Festival is one of the longest-running folk music festivals in the United States, since it began in 1962.

== History of Philly Folk Fest ==
According to the Philadelphia Folk Festival&#x27;s &quot;About Fest&quot; website, &quot;The Philadelphia Folk Festival emerged as a pivotal event in folk music history in the United States. Inaugurated in 1962 at Wilson Farm near Paoli, Pennsylvania, the festival featured renowned artists such as Reverend Gary Davis, Bonnie Dobson, and Pete Seeger. Despite expecting 2000 attendees, the festival drew in 2500 individuals, showcasing the growing interest in folk music. Over the years, the festival became a platform for musicians to share their talents and connect with like-minded individuals, contributing to the resurgence of folk music in the 1960s. This inaugural event laid the foundation for Philadelphia as a center for folk music culture&quot;.

The Philadelphia Folksong Society has presented the Philadelphia Folk Festival since 1962. Gene Shay and folklorist Kenneth S. Goldstein founded the festival, along with George Britton, Bob Seigel, David Baskin, Esther Halpern, Tossi Aaron and others. Shay acted as Master of Ceremonies since its inception until shortly before his death and Goldstein served as Program Director for the first 15 years. The festival was originally held on Wilson Farm in Paoli, Pennsylvania. 

The Thursday night Camp Stage show has previously been hosted by WXPN radio for the nationally syndicated &quot;World Cafe&quot; with David Dye.

The Philadelphia Folksong Society presents the Philadelphia Folk Festival and has had a full-time, year-round staff. The most recent PFS Executive Director, Justin Nordell, served in that capacity from 2007-2023, while past E.D.s include Lauri Barish and Levi Landis.

This festival went online in 2020 and 2021, raising over $200,000 to support artists out of work, as live concerts were cancelled caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Festival returned as a hybrid and in-person live event for 2022.

The hosting organization, the Philadelphia Folksong Society announced a pause in production, cancelling the 2023 festival for the first time in its 50 year history. It resumed under new leadership with a successful festival in 2024 and plans for the 2025 festival are underway.&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Baby M (born March 27, 1986) was the pseudonym used in the case &quot;In re Baby M&quot;, 537 A.2d 1227, 109 N.J. 396 (N.J. 1988) for the infant whose legal parentage was in question.

==Origins==
&quot;In re Baby M&quot; was a custody case that became the first American court ruling on the validity of surrogacy. William Stern entered into a surrogacy agreement with Mary Beth Whitehead, arranged by the Infertility Center of New York (&quot;ICNY&quot;), opened in 1981 by a Michigan attorney, Noel Keane. According to the agreement, Mary Beth Whitehead would be inseminated with William Stern&#x27;s sperm (making her a traditional, as opposed to gestational, surrogate), bring the pregnancy to term, and relinquish her parental rights in favor of William&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth. Mary Beth initially relinquished the child to the Sterns per the contract, but returned the next day, threatening to kill herself if she could not see the infant. The Sterns, not wanting to risk Mary Beth&#x27;s life, agreed to let her see the baby for an additional day or two. Instead of returning to the Sterns, Mary Beth and her husband Richard kidnapped Baby M for 87 days. The Sterns turned to the courts, who issued an &quot;ex parte&quot; order for the child to be returned to New Jersey, where the matter would be discussed in court, and temporary custody was awarded to the Sterns.

==Background details==
In March 1984, Mary Beth Whitehead responded to an ad placed by the Infertility Center of New York in the &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot; seeking women willing to help infertile couples have children. She was a high school drop-out who had married Richard Whitehead, a truck driver with whom she had two children. At roughly the time of her pregnancy with Baby M, Richard was in an accident. He failed to notice that a trailer carrying a full-sized bulldozer had detached from the large dump truck he was driving, as he passed through South Jersey&#x27;s largest traffic circle.

Elizabeth Stern was not infertile, but had multiple sclerosis and she and her husband William Stern were worried about the potential health implications of pregnancy, including temporary paralysis. While in vitro fertilization of harvested eggs, followed by implantation of a blastula/embryo, was an available technology, Elizabeth Stern feared the then-totally-unknown genetic risk factors, the choice repeatedly subject of the Court&#x27;s questions to Stern and his counsel. In court, Bill Stern testified that having a child who was related to him by blood was of particular importance because he is the last survivor of a family wiped out by the Holocaust in Nazi Germany.

The Sterns and Mary Beth Whitehead entered into a surrogacy contract, according to which Whitehead would be artificially inseminated with Stern&#x27;s sperm, and relinquish her parental rights in favor of the Sterns, in return for $10,000, and possibly expenses.

On March 27, 1986, Whitehead gave birth to a daughter. She managed initially to get a birth certificate, naming the infant Sara Elizabeth Whitehead. Three days after the birth, the infant was handed to the Sterns, who renamed her Melissa Elizabeth Stern. The very next day, Whitehead went back to the Sterns and demanded that the baby be given back to her. She told them that she could not live without her baby, that she must have her, even if only for one week, that thereafter she would surrender her child. The Sterns, concerned that Mrs. Whitehead might indeed kill herself, not wanting under any circumstances to risk that, and in any event believing that Mrs. Whitehead would keep her word, turned the child over to her.

The Whiteheads claimed that Mary Beth was suffering a debilitating post-partum bladder infection at the time, but in fact they kidnapped Baby M and fled from New Jersey for Florida. The Sterns’ counsel applied for, and the county prosecutor issued, warrants for their arrest.

While on the run, Whitehead made contact with the Sterns via telephone. William Stern, on the advice of counsel, recorded these conversations. Tapes were later introduced as evidence during court proceedings. In one 45-minute-long conversation, Mrs Whitehead threatens to kill Baby M multiple times: &quot;I gave her life. I can take her life away,&quot; and &quot;Forget it, Bill. I’ll tell you right now, I’d rather see me and her dead before you get her.&quot;

==Trial and appeal==
On March 31, 1987, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow formally validated the surrogacy contract and awarded custody of Melissa to the Sterns under a &quot;best interest of the child analysis&quot;. Judge Sorkow enforced the contract (signed by both parties before the child was conceived) and terminated the parental rights of the birth mother. He based the custody decision on the best interests of the child, taking into account testimony on the stability of Whitehead and Stern and their respective family situations, and also found that the surrogate parenting agreement was valid and enforceable. Whitehead&#x27;s parental rights were terminated and Elizabeth Stern was taken into chambers immediately after the ruling was read to formalize the adoption.

Whitehead appealed the decision. While on appeal, the Supreme Court of New Jersey continued the visitation schedule as it was during the initial trial while they considered their ruling. Whitehead took several actions either to claim the child, or incite the Sterns, including returning her wearing a hand-lettered shirt saying &quot;I have a brother and sister.&quot;

On February 3, 1988, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, led by Chief Justice Robert Wilentz, invalidated surrogacy contracts as against public policy but &quot;in dicta&quot; affirmed the trial court&#x27;s use of a &quot;best interest of the child&quot; analysis and remanded the case to family court. The Court held the contract to be unenforceable and restored Whitehead&#x27;s parental rights, leaving the terms of her visitation rights as noncustodial parent to be established by the trial court.

On remand, the lower court awarded custody to the Sterns and Whitehead was given visitation rights.

==Legal significance==
The case attracted much attention as it demonstrated that the possibilities of third party reproduction raise novel legal and social questions about the meaning of parenthood and the possibility of contracting around issues of pregnancy and childbirth. Among other points of contention, feminists argued about whether a woman&#x27;s basic human right to make decisions about her own body implied the ability to contract away parental rights to a child born to her, or whether recognizing such a right would entail too great risks of exploitation.

The New Jersey court&#x27;s finding that no contract can alter the legal position of a woman who bears a child as that child&#x27;s mother seemed to settle the question of the status of surrogacy contracts in America, at least until technological advances permitting gestational surrogacy—in which a woman can bear and give birth to a child to whom she has no genetic relation—reopened the question in many jurisdictions.

At least in New Jersey, however, the Baby M. ruling continues as precedent. In 2009, New Jersey Superior Court ruled that &quot;In re Baby M&quot; applies to gestational surrogacy as well as traditional surrogacy cases, in &quot;A.G.R. v. D.R.H &amp; S.H.&quot;. The intended parents were a homosexual male couple. They created an embryo using an anonymous donor ovum and the sperm of one of the husbands. The sister of the other husband carried the embryo to term and originally delivered the child to her brother and his husband, but a year later asserted her own parental rights even though she was not a genetic parent to the child. Judge Francis Schultz relied on &quot;In re Baby M&quot; to recognize the gestational mother as the child&#x27;s legal mother. However, a later ruling in 2011 awarded full custody to the biological father.

==Aftermath==
The Whiteheads divorced and Mary Beth married Dean Gould. The couple had two children.

Mary Beth and her ex-husband Richard sued ICNY and its founder, Noel Keane, claiming they committed fraud in the Baby M contract. The suit questioned whether Mrs. Whitehead Gould was properly counseled before becoming a surrogate mother. The parties settled out of court and the agreement, signed by Judge Pierre N. Leval of the Federal District Court, dismissed the case without costs or lawyers&#x27; fees but does not reveal terms of the settlement. It has been reported Keene and ICNY agreed to pay the couple $30,000 to $40,000.

Mary Beth Whitehead Gould wrote a book about her experience in 1989.

The Sterns continued to shun media attention. After reaching the age of maturity in March 2004, Melissa Stern legally terminated Mary Beth&#x27;s parental rights and formalized Elizabeth&#x27;s maternity through adoption proceedings. &quot;I love my family very much and am very happy to be with them,&quot; Melissa told a reporter for the &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; in 2007, referring to the Sterns. &quot;I&#x27;m very happy I ended up with them. I love them, they&#x27;re my best friends in the whole world, and that&#x27;s all I have to say about it.&quot;

Melissa is a graduate of George Washington University with a degree in religion. She completed her master&#x27;s degree at King&#x27;s College London, authoring a dissertation entitled &#x27;Reviving Solomon: Modern Day Questions Regarding the Long-term Implications for the Children of Surrogacy Arrangements&#x27;.

==In popular culture==
An ABC Network miniseries, simply titled &quot;Baby M&quot;, was broadcast in May 1988. The miniseries starred JoBeth Williams as Mary Beth Whitehead, John Shea as William, Bruce Weitz as Mary Beth&#x27;s husband Rick, Robin Strasser as Elizabeth and Dabney Coleman as Gary Skoloff. The miniseries received seven Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Miniseries, which it did not win. Williams, Shea, Weitz, and Coleman all received nominations for their performances, but only Shea won. Williams also was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance.

In 1989, Mary Beth Whitehead published her own book about her experiences, &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Story: The Truth About the Baby M Case&quot;.

In 1988, artist Martha Rosler made the video &quot;Born to be Sold: Martha Rosler Reads the Strange Case of Baby M&quot;.

Mary Beth Whitehead is referenced in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Bottle Deposit&quot;, when Jerry&#x27;s mechanic (played by Brad Garrett) steals Jerry&#x27;s car after he feels that Jerry is not caring for it properly.

The case is mentioned in the 2018 film &quot;Private Life&quot;.

<doc id="214167" wikidata="Q1358166" url="?curid=214167" title="Curse of the Bambino">
<text>The Curse of the Bambino was a superstitious sports curse in Major League Baseball (MLB) derived from the 86-year championship drought of the Boston Red Sox between and . The superstition was named after Babe Ruth, colloquially known as &quot;&quot;, who played for the Red Sox until he was sold to the New York Yankees in 1920. While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

Prior to the drought, the Red Sox had been one of the most successful professional baseball franchises. They won five of the first fifteen World Series titles, including the first in 1903, more than any other MLB team at the time. During this period, Ruth was a contributor to the Red Sox&#x27;s three championships in , , and . Following the sale of Ruth, however, the once lackluster Yankees became one of the most dominant professional sports franchises in North America, winning more than twice as many World Series titles as any other MLB team. The curse became a focal point of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry over the years.

Talk of the curse as an ongoing phenomenon ended when the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series. The Red Sox&#x27;s championship was prefaced by them overcoming a 3–0 deficit against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series (ALCS), the first and, , only time an MLB team won a best-of-seven playoff series after losing the first three games.

The curse had been such a part of Boston culture that when a &quot;reverse curve&quot; road sign on Longfellow Bridge over the city&#x27;s Storrow Drive was graffitied to read &quot;Reverse The Curse&quot;, officials left it in place until the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series. After the World Series that year, the road sign was edited to read &quot;Reversed Curse&quot; in celebration before its removal. On the 20th Anniversary of their World Series win, the sign was displayed on a duck boat during the Red Sox 2024 home opener parade.

==Lore==

Although it had long been noted that the selling of Ruth had been the beginning of a decline in the Red Sox&#x27;s fortunes, the term &quot;curse of the Bambino&quot; was not in common use until the publication of the book &quot;The Curse of the Bambino&quot; by Dan Shaughnessy in 1990. It became a key part of Red Sox lore in the media thereafter, and Shaughnessy&#x27;s book became required reading in some high school English classes in New England.

The first articulation of the curse appears at the end of chapter two of the book, in a letter to Mr. Shaughnessy from the Rev. Darrell Berger of the First Parish Unitarian Church in Scituate, Massachusetts. As an avid fan and occasional baseball writer and broadcaster whose congregation dates from Puritan times, he was in a unique position to place the frustration of Red Sox fans into historical prospective. He replies to Mr. Shaughnessy&#x27;s inquiry as to why &quot;curse&quot; is an applicable term, citing &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;, a tale of how one&#x27;s continuing ill fortune can be spun into a curse.

Rev. Berger writes, &quot;In both cases you have a cursed family because of evil that had been done and it&#x27;s passed down several generations later. I think of the selling of Ruth as the sin that cannot be atoned for. There hasn&#x27;t been a savior that can come along and make that atonement. The Sox over and over again keep paying for that sin. Frazee sins against Sox fans by selling Ruth. This severs trust between fans and ownership that has never healed. A curse is also merely a folkwise way of explaining the unexplainable, but who wants to leave it at that? So is the Old Testament.

&quot;The key for the curse to be lifted is acknowledgement that both sin and curse exist and why, in the same way an alcoholic or any dysfunctional relationship must be named before it can heal. The great danger of a curse is that the closer it gets to being overcome, the greater the anxiety becomes. Anxiety causes bad things to happen and the curse continues.&quot;

Although the title drought dated back to , the sale of Ruth to the Yankees was completed January 3, 1920. In standard curse lore, Red Sox owner and theatrical producer Harry Frazee used the proceeds from the sale to finance the production of a Broadway musical, usually said to be &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. In fact, Frazee backed many productions before and after Ruth&#x27;s sale, and &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; did not see its first performance until five years after the Ruth sale and two years after Frazee sold the Red Sox. In 1921, Red Sox manager Ed Barrow left to take over as general manager of the Yankees. Other Red Sox players were also later sold or traded to the Yankees.

Neither the lore, nor the debunking of it, entirely tells the story. As Leigh Montville wrote in &quot;The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth&quot;, the production &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; had originated as a non-musical stage play called &quot;My Lady Friends&quot;, which opened on Broadway in December 1919. That play had, indeed, been financed as a direct result of the Ruth deal. Various researchers, including Montville and Shaughnessy, have pointed out that Frazee had close ties to the Yankees owners, and that many of the player deals, as well as the mortgage deal for Fenway Park itself, had to do with financing his plays.

Yankee fans taunted the Red Sox with chants of &quot;1918!&quot; one weekend in September 1990. The demeaning chant echoed at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there. Yankees fans also taunted the Red Sox with signs saying &quot;1918!&quot;, &quot;CURSE OF THE BAMBINO&quot;, pictures of Babe Ruth, and wearing &quot;1918!&quot; T-shirts each time they were at the Stadium. The chant was only heard at Yankee Stadium.

==Reportedly cursed results==
Before Babe Ruth left Boston, the Red Sox had won five of the first fifteen World Series, with Ruth pitching for the and championship teams (he was with the Red Sox for the 1915 World Series, but manager Bill Carrigan used him only once, as a pinch-hitter, and he did not pitch). The Yankees had not played in any World Series up to that time. In the 84 years after the sale, the Yankees played in 39 World Series, winning 26 of them, twice as many as any other team in Major League Baseball. Meanwhile, over the same time span, the Red Sox played in only four World Series and lost each in seven games.

Even losses that occurred many years before the first mention of the supposed curse, in 1986, have been attributed to it. Some of these instances are listed below:
* In 1946, the Red Sox appeared in their first World Series since the sale of Babe Ruth and were favored to beat the St. Louis Cardinals. The series went to Game 7 at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in St. Louis. In the bottom of the eighth inning, with the score tied at 3–3, the Cardinals had Enos Slaughter on first base and Harry Walker at the plate. On a hit and run, Walker hit a double to very short left-center field. Slaughter ran through the third base coach&#x27;s stop sign and beat Boston shortstop Johnny Pesky&#x27;s relay throw to home plate. Some say Pesky hesitated on the throw, allowing Slaughter to score, but Pesky always denied this charge. Film footage is inconclusive, except that it shows Pesky in bright sunlight and Slaughter in shadow. Boston star Ted Williams, playing with an injury, was largely ineffective at the plate in his only World Series.
* In 1948, the Red Sox finished the regular season tied for first place, only to lose the pennant to the Cleveland Indians in the major leagues&#x27; first-ever one-game playoff. Cleveland would go on to win the World Series.
* In 1949, the Red Sox needed to win just one of the last two games of the season to win the pennant, but lost both games to the Yankees, who won a record five consecutive World Series from to .
* In 1967, the Red Sox surprisingly reversed the awful results of the 1966 season by winning the American League pennant on the last weekend of the regular season In the World Series, they once again faced the Cardinals, and just as in 1946, the Series went to Game 7, which St. Louis won, 7–2, behind their best pitcher Bob Gibson; Gibson defeated Boston ace Jim Lonborg, who was pitching on short rest and was ineffective. Gibson even hit a home run against Lonborg in the game.
* In 1972, the Red Sox ended the regular season with a three-game series against the Detroit Tigers, over whom they held a half-game lead in the American League East. Detroit won two of the three games to capture the division by half a game. (Due to the players&#x27; strike at the beginning of the season and the decision of Commissioner Bowie Kuhn not to reschedule any strike-cancelled games, the Tigers ended up playing and winning one more game than the Red Sox, finishing with a 86–70 record to Boston&#x27;s 85–70.)
* In 1975, the Red Sox won the pennant and met the dynastic Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. The Red Sox won Game 6 on a walk-off home run by catcher Carlton Fisk, setting the stage for the deciding Game 7. Boston took a quick 3–0 lead, but the Reds tied the game. In the top of the ninth, the Reds brought in the go-ahead run on a Joe Morgan single that scored Ken Griffey, Sr., winning what is regarded as one of the greatest World Series ever played.
* In 1978, the Red Sox held a 14-game lead in the American League East over the Yankees on July 18. However, the Yankees subsequently caught fire, eventually tying Boston atop the standings on September 10 after sweeping a four-game series at Fenway Park, an event known to Red Sox fans as the &quot;Boston Massacre.&quot; Six days later, the Yankees held a game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 12 of their next 14 games to overcome that deficit and force a one-game playoff on October 2 at Fenway Park. The memorable moment of the game came when light-hitting Yankee shortstop Bucky Dent cracked a three-run home run in the seventh inning that hit the top of the left field wall (the Green Monster) and skipped out of the park, giving New York a 3–2 lead. The Yankees held on to win the playoff game, 5–4, eventually winning the World Series.
* In Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets, Boston (leading the series three games to two) took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th inning. Red Sox reliever Calvin Schiraldi retired the first two batters, putting the team within one out (and shortly within one strike) of winning the World Series. However, the Mets scored three runs, tying the game on a wild pitch from Bob Stanley and winning it when Boston first baseman Bill Buckner allowed a ground ball hit by the Mets&#x27; Mookie Wilson to roll through his legs, scoring Ray Knight from second base. In Game 7, the Red Sox took an early 3–0 lead, only to lose, 8–5. The collapses in the last two games prompted &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist George Vecsey to write articles describing the Red Sox as cursed.
* In 1988 and 1990, the Red Sox advanced to the American League Championship Series (ALCS), only to suffer four-game sweeps both times at the hands of the Oakland Athletics. They were also swept by the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) in three games (extending their postseason losing streak to a major-league record 13 games), lost again to the Indians in the 1998 ALDS three games to one, and were defeated by the eventual World Series-champion Yankees four games to one in the 1999 ALCS.
* In 2003, the Red Sox were playing the Yankees in Game 7 of the ALCS. Boston held a 5–2 lead in the eighth inning, and manager Grady Little opted to stay with starting pitcher Pedro Martínez rather than go to the bullpen. New York rallied against the tired Martínez, scoring three runs on a single and three doubles to tie the game. In the bottom of the 11th inning, future Yankees manager Aaron Boone launched a walk-off solo home run against knuckleballing Boston starter Tim Wakefield (pitching in relief) to win the game and the pennant for the Yankees, who would go on to lose to the Florida Marlins 4 games to 2 in the World Series.

==Attempts to break the curse==

Red Sox fans attempted various methods over the years to exorcise their famous curse. These included placing a Boston cap atop Mount Everest and burning a Yankees cap at its base camp and finding a piano owned by Ruth that he had supposedly pushed into a pond near his Sudbury, Massachusetts farm, Home Plate Farm.

In 1976, Laurie Cabot, the Witch of Massachusetts, was brought in to end a 10-game losing streak. While the losing streak ended, the Curse of the Bambino did not.

In Ken Burns&#x27;s 1994 documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;, former Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee suggested that the Red Sox should exhume the body of Babe Ruth, transport it back to Fenway and publicly apologize for trading Ruth to the Yankees.

Some declared the curse broken during a game on August 31, 2004, when a foul ball hit by Manny Ramírez flew into Section 9, Box 95, Row AA and struck a boy&#x27;s face, knocking two of his teeth out. 16-year-old Lee Gavin, a Boston fan whose favorite player was Ramirez, lived on the Sudbury farm owned by Ruth. That same day, the Yankees suffered their worst loss in team history, a 22–0 clobbering at home against the Cleveland Indians.

Some fans also cite a comedy curse-breaking ceremony performed by musician Jimmy Buffett and his warm-up team (one dressed as Ruth and one dressed as a witch doctor) at a Fenway concert in September 2004. Just after being traded to the Red Sox, Curt Schilling appeared in an advertisement for the Ford F-150 pickup truck hitchhiking with a sign indicating he was going to Boston. When picked up, he said that he had &quot;an 86-year-old curse&quot; to break.

==End of the curse==

In 2004, the Red Sox once again met the Yankees in the American League Championship Series. The Red Sox lost the first three games, including losing Game 3 at Fenway by the lopsided score of 19–8.

The Red Sox trailed 4–3 in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4. But the team tied the game with a walk by Kevin Millar and a stolen base by pinch-runner Dave Roberts, followed by an RBI single against Yankee closer Mariano Rivera by third baseman Bill Mueller, and won on a two-run home run in the 12th inning by David Ortiz. The Red Sox won the next three games to become the first and only MLB team to win a seven-game postseason series after losing the first three games.

The Red Sox then faced the St. Louis Cardinals, the team to whom they had lost in and , and led throughout the series, winning in a four-game sweep. Cardinals shortstop Édgar Rentería, who wore the same number as Ruth (3), was the final out of the series, a ground ball back to pitcher Keith Foulke. Fox commentator Joe Buck famously called the grounder with: &quot;Back to Foulke. Red Sox fans have longed to hear it: The Boston Red Sox are World Champions!&quot;

Glenn Stout argues that the idea of a curse was indirectly influenced by antisemitism, although that aspect was not part of its modern usage; he even says &quot;This does not mean that ... anyone who writes or speaks of the Curse today—as a journalist or a fan—is either anti-Semitic or even remotely aware of the anti-Semitic roots of the Curse.&quot; Because Frazee was from New York and involved in theatre, it was assumed he was Jewish (he was actually a Presbyterian). Though Frazee was well respected in Boston, Henry Ford&#x27;s &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; ran a series of articles purporting to expose how Jews were &quot;destroying America&quot;, and among these were articles lambasting Frazee, saying that with his purchase of the Red Sox &quot;another club was placed under the smothering influences of the &#x27;chosen race&#x27;.&quot; These articles turned the tide of both baseball owners and public opinion against Frazee, and Fred Lieb&#x27;s vilification of Frazee in his history of the Red Sox portrayed him implicitly as a Jew. Stout argues that this hatred indirectly created the atmosphere where the &quot;curse&quot; could be accepted.

==In popular culture==
===Non-fiction works===
* The 2004 Red Sox season was the subject of several non-fiction books, including &quot;Faithful: Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season&quot;, whose authors Stewart O&#x27;Nan and Stephen King decided to write the book before the season began, and &quot;Reversing the Curse&quot; by Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.
* In the fall of 2003, HBO produced the Emmy Award-winning documentary called &quot;The Curse of the Bambino&quot;, directed by filmmaker George Roy. It featured commentary from native Boston celebrities such as Denis Leary, narrated by Ben Affleck. After the 2004 World Series, the ending of the documentary was re-filmed with a number of the same celebrities and it was retitled &quot;Reverse of the Curse of the Bambino&quot;, narrated by Liev Schreiber. Schreiber&#x27;s character was also introduced reading a copy of the book in the 2015 film &quot;Spotlight&quot;.

===Fiction===
* The British memoir &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, about author Nick Hornby&#x27;s obsession with the Arsenal FC English soccer team, was adapted into an American film of the same name by the Farrelly brothers. The American adaptation was about an obsessive Red Sox fan. It was made during the 2004 World Series, which forced the filmmakers to rework the story; the Red Sox were not originally supposed to make it to the World Series.
* In the movie &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, Adam Sandler&#x27;s character Henry Roth reminds his girlfriend about what happened in 2003 including a screen capture showing the Red Sox winning the World Series, until the next clip shows the title &#x27;just kidding&#x27;. The movie was released in February 2004.
* On the television show &quot;Lost&quot;, Jack and his father Christian often use the phrase &quot;That&#x27;s why the Sox will never win the damn series&quot; to describe fate. In season 3, Ben shows the end of the 2004 game to try to convince Jack that the Others have contact with the outside world.
* In the movie &quot;Moneyball&quot;, Brad Pitt&#x27;s character Billy Beane talks to the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s owner about a job as GM after taking the Oakland A&#x27;s to a 20-game winning streak. When the Red Sox&#x27;s owner asks Billy Beane why he returned his call, he says because he wants to help them end the Curse of the Bambino.
* An episode of the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Arthur&quot; titled &quot;The Curse of the Grebes&quot; has Elwood City&#x27;s baseball team losing two of its games in the world championship series due to events based directly on Bucky Dent&#x27;s homer and Bill Buckner&#x27;s error. The episode states that the team had not won a championship in 87 years and that their opponents, the Crown City Kings, had won 25 since then. Johnny Damon, Edgar Renteria, and Mike Timlin all voice caricatures of themselves.

===Music===
* The 2004 Dropkick Murphys song &quot;Tessie&quot; was released as a single in June, 2004, and referenced the singing of the 1903 song of the same title which had been sung by the Royal Rooters when the Boston Americans won the 1903 World Series. The song intended to &quot;bring back the spirit of the Royal Rooters and put the Red Sox back on top&quot;, which would break the curse of the Bambino, in the 2004 Major League pennant race. Their version became the official song of the Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series run, and was included on the Dropkick Murphys 2005 album &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Code&quot; with added audio of the WEEI broadcast of the last play of the 2004 World Series. The song is still played at Red Sox games.
* The Ben Harper song &quot;Get It Like You Like It&quot; from his 2006 album &quot;Both Sides of the Gun&quot; includes the lines &quot;In 1918 the Great Bambino kicked a piano into Willis Pond. But Johnny Damon swung his bat, grand slam, that was that. An 86-year curse is gone.&quot;
* James Taylor &quot;Angels of Fenway&quot; (Album – &quot;Before This World&quot;) released June 15, 2015. Taylor sings &quot;86 summers gone by. Bambino put a hex on the Bean. We were living on a tear and a sigh. In the shadow of the Bronx machine...&quot;

===Other===
* At WrestleMania XIV held in Boston in 1998, guest ring announcer Pete Rose taunted the Boston crowd about the curse (Rose was on the Cincinnati Reds team that beat Boston in the 1975 World Series) before he was tombstoned by Kane.
* After New York&#x27;s defeat, the Curse was poked fun at during the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, when the ghost of Babe Ruth explains that he left during Game Four with the ghosts of Mickey Mantle and Rodney Dangerfield to go drinking.

===Video games===
* In the &quot;Fallout&quot; universe, one of the events that results as a knock-on effect from the Timeline Divergence (the timeline of the games diverges from reality shortly after World War II) is that the curse was never broken and the Boston Red Sox never won the World Series, even up to 2077. This was revealed by newspaper articles in &quot;Fallout 4&quot; (2015) which is set in Boston, and show that the Red Sox were up 3–0 against &quot;Texas&quot; (implicitly, the Texas Rangers) in 2077; Game 7 was scheduled for October 23. However, on that day, a nuclear war occurred (causing the post-apocalyptic setting of the games), with Boston avoiding direct atomic bombing but affected by radiation from nearby, and the game was called off.
* The curse is referenced in Valve&#x27;s &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, with an achievement named &quot;A Year To Remember&quot;. It can be unlocked by obtaining 2,004 lifetime kills with the Scout, who is himself a Boston native and baseball enthusiast.
* In mobile game &quot;Pinball Deluxe Reloaded&quot; on one of the tables there is a mission of lifting curses, one of which is named &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;.
