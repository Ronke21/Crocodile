<text>In physics and fluid mechanics, a boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface formed by the fluid flowing along the surface. The fluid&#x27;s interaction with the wall induces a no-slip boundary condition (zero velocity at the wall). The flow velocity then monotonically increases above the surface until it returns to the bulk flow velocity. The thin layer consisting of fluid whose velocity has not yet returned to the bulk flow velocity is called the velocity boundary layer.

The air next to a human is heated, resulting in gravity-induced convective airflow, which results in both a velocity and thermal boundary layer. A breeze disrupts the boundary layer, and hair and clothing protect it, making the human feel cooler or warmer. On an aircraft wing, the velocity boundary layer is the part of the flow close to the wing, where viscous forces distort the surrounding non-viscous flow. In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the atmospheric boundary layer is the air layer (~ 1 km) near the ground. It is affected by the surface; day-night heat flows caused by the sun heating the ground, moisture, or momentum transfer to or from the surface.

==Types of boundary layers==

Laminar boundary layers can be loosely classified according to their structure and the circumstances under which they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body is an example of a Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.

The viscous nature of airflow reduces the local velocities on a surface and is responsible for skin friction. The layer of air over the wing&#x27;s surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer. There are two different types of boundary layer flow: laminar and turbulent.

Laminar boundary layer flow

The laminar boundary is a very smooth flow, while the turbulent boundary layer contains swirls or &quot;eddies.&quot; The laminar flow creates less skin friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing surface begins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow continues back from the leading edge, the laminar boundary layer increases in thickness.

Turbulent boundary layer flow

At some distance back from the leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have a large amount of the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.

==The Prandtl boundary layer concept==

 The aerodynamic boundary layer was first hypothesized by Ludwig Prandtl in a paper presented on August 12, 1904, at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg, Germany. It simplifies the equations of fluid flow by dividing the flow field into two areas: one inside the boundary layer, dominated by viscosity and creating the majority of drag experienced by the boundary body; and one outside the boundary layer, where viscosity can be neglected without significant effects on the solution. This allows a closed-form solution for the flow in both areas by making significant simplifications of the full Navier–Stokes equations. The same hypothesis is applicable to other fluids (besides air) with moderate to low viscosity such as water. For the case where there is a temperature difference between the surface and the bulk fluid, it is found that the majority of the heat transfer to and from a body takes place in the vicinity of the velocity boundary layer. This again allows the equations to be simplified in the flow field outside the boundary layer. The pressure distribution throughout the boundary layer in the direction normal to the surface (such as an airfoil) remains relatively constant throughout the boundary layer, and is the same as on the surface itself.

The thickness of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as the distance from the solid body to the point at which the viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.

The thermal boundary layer thickness is similarly the distance from the body at which the temperature is 99% of the freestream temperature. The ratio of the two thicknesses is governed by the Prandtl number. If the Prandtl number is 1, the two boundary layers are the same thickness. If the Prandtl number is greater than 1, the thermal boundary layer is thinner than the velocity boundary layer. If the Prandtl number is less than 1, which is the case for air at standard conditions, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer.

In high-performance designs, such as gliders and commercial aircraft, much attention is paid to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to minimize drag. Two effects have to be considered. First, the boundary layer adds to the effective thickness of the body, through the displacement thickness, hence increasing the pressure drag. Secondly, the shear forces at the surface of the wing create skin friction drag.

At high Reynolds numbers, typical of full-sized aircraft, it is desirable to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One way of dealing with this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow (NLF) techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the airfoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.

At lower Reynolds numbers, such as those seen with model aircraft, it is relatively easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.

When using half-models in wind tunnels, a peniche is sometimes used to reduce or eliminate the effect of the boundary layer.

==Boundary layer equations==

The deduction of the boundary layer equations was one of the most important advances in fluid dynamics. Using an order of magnitude analysis, the well-known governing Navier–Stokes equations of viscous fluid flow can be greatly simplified within the boundary layer. Notably, the characteristic of the partial differential equations (PDE) becomes parabolic, rather than the elliptical form of the full Navier–Stokes equations. This greatly simplifies the solution of the equations. By making the boundary layer approximation, the flow is divided into an inviscid portion (which is easy to solve by a number of methods) and the boundary layer, which is governed by an easier to solve PDE. The continuity and Navier–Stokes equations for a two-dimensional steady incompressible flow in Cartesian coordinates are given by

:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3

where formula_4 and formula_5 are the velocity components, formula_6 is the density, formula_7 is the pressure, and formula_8 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid at a point.

The approximation states that, for a sufficiently high Reynolds number the flow over a surface can be divided into an outer region of inviscid flow unaffected by viscosity (the majority of the flow), and a region close to the surface where viscosity is important (the boundary layer). Let formula_4 and formula_5 be streamwise and transverse (wall normal) velocities respectively inside the boundary layer. Using scale analysis, it can be shown that the above equations of motion reduce within the boundary layer to become

:formula_11

:formula_12

and if the fluid is incompressible (as liquids are under standard conditions):

:formula_1

The order of magnitude analysis assumes the streamwise length scale significantly larger than the transverse length scale inside the boundary layer. It follows that variations in properties in the streamwise direction are generally much lower than those in the wall normal direction. Apply this to the continuity equation shows that formula_5, the wall normal velocity, is small compared with formula_4 the streamwise velocity.

Since the static pressure formula_7 is independent of formula_17, then pressure at the edge of the boundary layer is the pressure throughout the boundary layer at a given streamwise position. The external pressure may be obtained through an application of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation. Let formula_18 be the fluid velocity outside the boundary layer, where formula_19 and formula_18 are both parallel. This gives upon substituting for formula_7 the following result

:formula_22

For a flow in which the static pressure formula_23 also does not change in the direction of the flow

:formula_24

so formula_18 remains constant.

Therefore, the equation of motion simplifies to become

:formula_26

These approximations are used in a variety of practical flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution often referred to as the Blasius boundary layer.

===Prandtl&#x27;s transposition theorem===
Prandtl observed that from any solution formula_27 which satisfies the boundary layer equations, further solution formula_28, which is also satisfying the boundary layer equations, can be constructed by writing

:formula_29

where formula_30 is arbitrary. Since the solution is not unique from mathematical perspective, to the solution can be added any one of an infinite set of eigenfunctions as shown by Stewartson and Paul A. Libby.

===Von Kármán momentum integral===
Von Kármán derived the integral equation by integrating the boundary layer equation across the boundary layer in 1921. The equation is

:formula_31

where

:formula_32

:formula_33 is the wall shear stress, formula_34 is the suction/injection velocity at the wall, formula_35 is the displacement thickness and formula_36 is the momentum thickness. Kármán–Pohlhausen Approximation is derived from this equation.

===Energy integral===
The energy integral was derived by Wieghardt.

:formula_37

where

:formula_38

:formula_39 is the energy dissipation rate due to viscosity across the boundary layer and formula_40 is the energy thickness.

===Von Mises transformation===
For steady two-dimensional boundary layers, von Mises introduced a transformation which takes formula_41 and formula_42(stream function) as independent variables instead of formula_41 and formula_17 and uses a dependent variable formula_45 instead of formula_4. The boundary layer equation then become

:formula_47

The original variables are recovered from

:formula_48

This transformation is later extended to compressible boundary layer by von Kármán and HS Tsien.

===Crocco&#x27;s transformation===
For steady two-dimensional compressible boundary layer, Luigi Crocco introduced a transformation which takes formula_41 and formula_4 as independent variables instead of formula_41 and formula_17 and uses a dependent variable formula_53(shear stress) instead of formula_4. The boundary layer equation then becomes

: formula_55

The original coordinate is recovered from

:formula_56

==Turbulent boundary layers==

The treatment of turbulent boundary layers is far more difficult due to the time-dependent variation of the flow properties. One of the most widely used techniques in which turbulent flows are tackled is to apply Reynolds decomposition. Here the instantaneous flow properties are decomposed into a mean and fluctuating component with the assumption that the mean of the fluctuating component is always zero. Applying this technique to the boundary layer equations gives the full turbulent boundary layer equations not often given in literature:

:formula_57

:formula_58

:formula_59

Using a similar order-of-magnitude analysis, the above equations can be reduced to leading order terms. By choosing length scales formula_60 for changes in the transverse-direction, and formula_61 for changes in the streamwise-direction, with formula_62, the x-momentum equation simplifies to:

:formula_63

This equation does not satisfy the no-slip condition at the wall. Like Prandtl did for his boundary layer equations, a new, smaller length scale must be used to allow the viscous term to become leading order in the momentum equation. By choosing formula_64 as the &quot;y&quot;-scale, the leading order momentum equation for this &quot;inner boundary layer&quot; is given by:

:formula_65

In the limit of infinite Reynolds number, the pressure gradient term can be shown to have no effect on the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer. The new &quot;inner length scale&quot; formula_66 is a viscous length scale, and is of order formula_67, with formula_68 being the velocity scale of the turbulent fluctuations, in this case a friction velocity.

Unlike the laminar boundary layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. the inner and outer scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent boundary layer difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.

Similar approaches to the above analysis has also been applied for thermal boundary layers, using the energy equation in compressible flows.

The additional term formula_69 in the turbulent boundary layer equations is known as the Reynolds shear stress and is unknown a priori. The solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations therefore necessitates the use of a turbulence model, which aims to express the Reynolds shear stress in terms of known flow variables or derivatives. The lack of accuracy and generality of such models is a major obstacle in the successful prediction of turbulent flow properties in modern fluid dynamics.

A constant stress layer exists in the near wall region. Due to the damping of the vertical velocity fluctuations near the wall, the Reynolds stress term will become negligible and we find that a linear velocity profile exists. This is only true for the very near wall region.

== Heat and mass transfer ==
In 1928, the French engineer André Lévêque observed that convective heat transfer in a flowing fluid is affected only by the velocity values very close to the surface. For flows of large Prandtl number, the temperature/mass transition from surface to freestream temperature takes place across a very thin region close to the surface. Therefore, the most important fluid velocities are those inside this very thin region in which the change in velocity can be considered linear with normal distance from the surface. In this way, for
:formula_70
when formula_71, then
:formula_72
where &quot;θ&quot; is the tangent of the Poiseuille parabola intersecting the wall.
Although Lévêque&#x27;s solution was specific to heat transfer into a Poiseuille flow, his insight helped lead other scientists to an exact solution of the thermal boundary-layer problem. Schuh observed that in a boundary-layer, &quot;u&quot; is again a linear function of &quot;y&quot;, but that in this case, the wall tangent is a function of &quot;x&quot;. He expressed this with a modified version of Lévêque&#x27;s profile,

:formula_73

This results in a very good approximation, even for low formula_74 numbers, so that only liquid metals with formula_74 much less than 1 cannot be treated this way.
In 1962, Kestin and Persen published a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For the problem of a flat plate with a temperature jump at formula_76, they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature at any point in the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function. Analytic solutions can be derived with the time-dependent self-similar Ansatz for the incompressible boundary layer equations including heat conduction.

As is well known from several textbooks, heat transfer tends to decrease with the increase in the boundary layer. Recently, it was observed on a practical and large scale that wind flowing through a photovoltaic generator tends to &quot;trap&quot; heat in the PV panels under a turbulent regime due to the decrease in heat transfer. Despite being frequently assumed to be inherently turbulent, this accidental observation demonstrates that natural wind behaves in practice very close to an ideal fluid, at least in an observation resembling the expected behaviour in a flat plate, potentially reducing the difficulty in analysing this kind of phenomenon on a larger scale.

==Convective transfer constants from boundary layer analysis==

Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius derived an exact solution to the above laminar boundary layer equations. The thickness of the boundary layer formula_77 is a function of the Reynolds number for laminar flow.

:formula_78

:formula_77 = the thickness of the boundary layer: the region of flow where the velocity is less than 99% of the far field velocity formula_80; formula_41 is position along the semi-infinite plate, and formula_82 is the Reynolds Number given by formula_83 (formula_84 density and formula_85 dynamic viscosity).

The Blasius solution uses boundary conditions in a dimensionless form:

:formula_86atformula_87

:formula_88atformula_89 and formula_90

Note that in many cases, the no-slip boundary condition holds that formula_91, the fluid velocity at the surface of the plate equals the velocity of the plate at all locations. If the plate is not moving, then formula_92. A much more complicated derivation is required if fluid slip is allowed.

In fact, the Blasius solution for laminar velocity profile in the boundary layer above a semi-infinite plate can be easily extended to describe Thermal and Concentration boundary layers for heat and mass transfer respectively. Rather than the differential x-momentum balance (equation of motion), this uses a similarly derived Energy and Mass balance:

Energy: formula_93

Mass: formula_94

For the momentum balance, kinematic viscosity formula_8 can be considered to be the &quot;momentum diffusivity&quot;. In the energy balance this is replaced by thermal diffusivity formula_96, and by mass diffusivity formula_97 in the mass balance. In thermal diffusivity of a substance, formula_98 is its thermal conductivity, formula_6 is its density and formula_100 is its heat capacity. Subscript AB denotes diffusivity of species A diffusing into species B.

Under the assumption that formula_101, these equations become equivalent to the momentum balance. Thus, for Prandtl number formula_102 and Schmidt number formula_103 the Blasius solution applies directly.

Accordingly, this derivation uses a related form of the boundary conditions, replacing formula_104 with formula_105 or formula_106 (absolute temperature or concentration of species A). The subscript S denotes a surface condition.

:formula_107atformula_87

:formula_109atformula_89 and formula_90

Using the streamline function Blasius obtained the following solution for the shear stress at the surface of the plate.

:formula_112

And via the boundary conditions, it is known that

:formula_113

We are given the following relations for heat/mass flux out of the surface of the plate

:formula_114

:formula_115

So for formula_116

:formula_117

where formula_118 are the regions of flow where formula_105 and formula_106 are less than 99% of their far field values.

Because the Prandtl number of a particular fluid is not often unity, German engineer E. Polhausen who worked with Ludwig Prandtl attempted to empirically extend these equations to apply for formula_121. His results can be applied to formula_122 as well. He found that for Prandtl number greater than 0.6, the thermal boundary layer thickness was approximately given by:

:formula_123and thereforeformula_124

From this solution, it is possible to characterize the convective heat/mass transfer constants based on the region of boundary layer flow. Fourier&#x27;s law of conduction and Newton&#x27;s Law of Cooling are combined with the flux term derived above and the boundary layer thickness.

:formula_125

:formula_126

This gives the local convective constant formula_127 at one point on the semi-infinite plane. Integrating over the length of the plate gives an average

:formula_128

Following the derivation with mass transfer terms (formula_98 = convective mass transfer constant, formula_97 = diffusivity of species A into species B, formula_131 ), the following solutions are obtained:

:formula_132

:formula_133

These solutions apply for laminar flow with a Prandtl/Schmidt number greater than 0.6.

==Naval architecture==
Many of the principles that apply to aircraft also apply to ships, submarines, and offshore platforms, with water as the primary fluid of concern rather than air. As water is not an ideal fluid, ships moving in water experience resistance. The fluid particles cling to the hull of the ship due to the adhesive force between water and the ship, creating a boundary layer where the speed of flow of the fluid forms a small but steep speed gradient, with the fluid in contact with the ship ideally has a relative velocity of 0, and the fluid at the border of the boundary layer being the free-stream speed, or the relative speed of the fluid around the ship.

While the front of the ship faces normal pressure forces due to the fluid surrounding it, the aft portion sees a lower acting component of pressure due to the boundary layer. This leads to higher resistance due to pressure known as &#x27;viscous pressure drag&#x27; or &#x27;form drag&#x27;.

For ships, unlike aircraft, one deals with incompressible flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa leads to a change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses.

==Boundary layer turbine==
This effect was exploited in the Tesla turbine, patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913. It is referred to as a bladeless turbine because it uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Boundary layer turbines are also known as cohesion-type turbine, bladeless turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl).

== Predicting transient boundary layer thickness in a cylinder using dimensional analysis ==

By using the transient and viscous force equations for a cylindrical flow you can predict the transient boundary layer thickness by finding the Womersley Number (formula_134).

Transient Force = formula_135

Viscous Force = formula_136

Setting them equal to each other gives:

:formula_137

Solving for delta gives:

:formula_138

In dimensionless form:

:formula_139

where formula_134 = Womersley Number; formula_141 = density; formula_142 = velocity; formula_143 ?; formula_144 = length of transient boundary layer; formula_145 = viscosity; formula_61 = characteristic length.

== Predicting convective flow conditions at the boundary layer in a cylinder using dimensional analysis ==

By using the convective and viscous force equations at the boundary layer for a cylindrical flow you can predict the convective flow conditions at the boundary layer by finding the dimensionless Reynolds Number (formula_147).

Convective force: formula_148

Viscous force: formula_149

Setting them equal to each other gives:

:formula_150

Solving for delta gives:

:formula_151

In dimensionless form:

:formula_152

where formula_147 = Reynolds Number; formula_141 = density; formula_142 = velocity; formula_156 = length of convective boundary layer; formula_145 = viscosity; formula_61 = characteristic length.

== Boundary layer ingestion ==

Boundary layer ingestion promises an increase in aircraft fuel efficiency with an aft-mounted propulsor ingesting the slow fuselage boundary layer and re-energising the wake to reduce drag and improve propulsive efficiency.
To operate in distorted airflow, the fan is heavier and its efficiency is reduced, and its integration is challenging.
It is used in concepts like the Aurora D8 or the French research agency Onera&#x27;s Nova, saving 5% in cruise by ingesting 40% of the fuselage boundary layer.

Airbus presented the Nautilius concept at the ICAS congress in September 2018:
to ingest all the fuselage boundary layer, while minimizing the azimuthal flow distortion, the fuselage splits into two spindles with 13-18:1 bypass ratio fans.
Propulsive efficiencies are up to 90% like counter-rotating open rotors with smaller, lighter, less complex and noisy engines.
It could lower fuel burn by over 10% compared to a usual underwing 15:1 bypass ratio engine.

<doc id="224303" wikidata="Q5036188" url="?curid=224303" title="Capping inversion">
<text>A capping inversion is an elevated inversion layer that caps a convective planetary boundary layer.

The boundary layer is the part of the atmosphere which is closest to the ground. Normally, the sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air just above it. Thermals form when this warm air rises into the cold air (warm air is less dense than cold air), a process called convection. A convective layer such as this has the potential for cloud formation, since condensation occurs as the warm air rises and cools.

An inversion occurs when the normal temperature (warm air below, cold air above) profile is reversed, creating a stable configuration of dense, cold air sitting below lighter, warm air. An elevated inversion layer is thus a region of warm air above a region of cold air, but higher in the atmosphere (generally not touching the surface).

A capping inversion occurs when there is a boundary layer with a normal temperature profile (warm air rising into cooler air) and the layer above that is an inversion layer (cooler air below warm air). Cloud formation from the lower layer is &quot;capped&quot; by the inversion layer. Air stagnation may result from a capping inversion from diffusing from a region, increasing the concentration of pollutants and exacerbating poor air quality. If the capping inversion layer or &quot;cap&quot; is too strong it will prevent thunderstorms from developing. A strong cap can result in foggy conditions.

However, if the air at the surface is unstable enough, strong updrafts can be forced through the capping inversion. This selective process of only allowing the strongest updrafts to form thunderstorms often results in outbreaks of severe weather. The role of capping inversions in bolstering the intensity of severe weather was realized in conceptual models that were developed by atmospheric science researchers in the late 1960s and had been recognized as a characteristic of tornado-producing airmasses as early as 1954. In some severe weather events, this capping inversion can emerge when a warm and dry mixed layer originating over a high plateau moves over a cooler and moister airmass, forming an &quot;elevated mixed layer&quot; (EML). EMLs can be found worldwide downwind of high terrain, such as over South Asia, eastern Australia, east of the Rocky Mountains in the central U.S. and northern Mexico, and east of the foothills of the Andes.

<doc id="224306" wikidata="Q3177722" url="?curid=224306" title="Braddock Expedition">
<text>The Braddock Expedition, also known as Braddock&#x27;s Campaign or Braddock&#x27;s Defeat, was a British military expedition which attempted to capture Fort Duquesne from the French in 1755 during the French and Indian War. The expedition, named after its commander General Edward Braddock, was defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 and forced to retreat; Braddock was killed in action along with more than 500 of his troops. It ultimately proved to be a major setback for the British in the early stages of the war, one of the most disastrous defeats suffered by British forces in the 18th century.

==Background==

Braddock&#x27;s expedition was part of a massive British offensive against the French in North America that summer. As commander-in-chief of the British Army in America, General Edward Braddock led the main thrust against the Ohio Country with a column some 2,100 strong. His command consisted of two regular line regiments, the 44th and 48th, in all 1,400 regular soldiers and 700 provincial troops from several of the Thirteen Colonies, and artillery and other support troops. With these men, Braddock expected to seize Fort Duquesne easily, and then push on to capture a series of French forts, eventually reaching Fort Niagara. George Washington, promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of the Virginia Regiment on June 4, 1754, by Governor Robert Dinwiddie, was then just 23, knew the territory and served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General Braddock. Braddock&#x27;s Chief of Scouts was Lieutenant John Fraser of the Virginia Regiment. Fraser owned land at Turtle Creek, had been at Fort Necessity, and had served as Second-in-Command at Fort Prince George (replaced by Fort Duquesne by the French), at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers.

Braddock mostly failed in his attempts to recruit Native American allies from those tribes not yet allied with the French; he had but eight Mingo Indians with him led by George Croghan, serving as scouts. A number of Native Americans in the area, notably Delaware leader Shingas, remained neutral. Caught between two powerful European empires at war, the local Native Americans could not afford to be on the side of the loser. They would decide based on Braddock&#x27;s success or failure.

==Braddock&#x27;s Road==
Setting out from Fort Cumberland in Maryland on May 29, 1755, the expedition faced an enormous logistical challenge: moving a large body of men with equipment, provisions, and (most importantly, for attacking the forts) heavy cannons, across the densely wooded Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania, a journey of about . Braddock had received important assistance from Benjamin Franklin, who helped procure wagons and supplies for the expedition. Among the wagoners were two young men who would later become legends of American history: Daniel Boone and Daniel Morgan. Other members of the expedition included Ensign William Crawford and Charles Scott. Among the officers of the expedition were Thomas Gage, Charles Lee, future American president George Washington, and Horatio Gates.

The expedition progressed slowly because Braddock considered making a road to Fort Duquesne a priority in order to effectively supply the position he expected to capture and hold at the Forks of the Ohio, and because of a shortage of healthy draft animals. In some cases, the column was only able to progress at a rate of two miles (about 3 km) a day, creating Braddock&#x27;s Road — an important legacy of the march — as they went. To speed up movement, Braddock split his men into a &quot;flying column&quot; of about 1,300 men which he commanded, and, lagging far behind, a supply column of 800 men with most of the baggage, commanded by Colonel Thomas Dunbar. They passed the ruins of Fort Necessity along the way, where the French and Canadians had defeated Washington the previous summer. Small French and Native American war bands skirmished with Braddock&#x27;s men during the march.

Meanwhile, at Fort Duquesne, the French garrison consisted of only about 250 French marines and Canadian militia, with about 640 Native American allies camped outside the fort. The Native Americans were from a variety of tribes long associated with the French, including Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Potawatomis. Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur, the Canadian commander, received reports from Native American scouting parties that the British were on their way to besiege the fort. He realised he could not withstand Braddock&#x27;s cannon, and decided to launch a preemptive strike, an ambush of Braddock&#x27;s army as he crossed the Monongahela River. The Native American allies were initially reluctant to attack such a large British force, but the French field commander Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu, who dressed himself in full war regalia complete with war paint, convinced them to follow his lead.

== Battle of the Monongahela ==

By July 8, 1755, the Braddock force was on the land owned by the Chief Scout, Lieutenant John Fraser. That evening, the Native Americans sent delegates to the British to request a conference. Braddock chose Washington and Fraser as his emissaries. The Native Americans asked the British to halt their advance, claiming that the French could be persuaded to peacefully leave Fort Duquesne. Both Washington and Fraser recommended that Braddock approve the plan, but he demurred.

On July 9, 1755, Braddock&#x27;s men crossed the Monongahela without opposition, about south of Fort Duquesne. The advance guard of 300 grenadiers and colonials, accompanied by two cannon, and commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage began to move ahead. Washington tried to warn Braddock of the flaws in his plan — such as pointing out that the French and the Native Americans fought differently than the open-field style used by the British -- but his efforts were ignored: Braddock insisted that his troops fight as &quot;gentlemen&quot;. Then, unexpectedly, Gage&#x27;s advance guard came upon Beaujeu&#x27;s party of French and Native Americans, who were hurrying to the river, behind schedule and too late to prepare an ambush.

In the skirmish that followed between Gage&#x27;s soldiers and the French, Beaujeu was among those killed by the first volley of musket fire by the grenadiers. Although some 100 French Canadians fled back to the fort and the noise of the cannon held the Native Americans off, Beaujeu&#x27;s death did not have a negative effect on French morale. Jean-Daniel Dumas, a French officer, rallied the rest of the French and their Native American allies. The battle, known as the Battle of the Monongahela, or the &quot;Battle of the Wilderness&quot;, or just &quot;Braddock&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, was officially begun. Braddock&#x27;s force was approximately 1,400 men. The British faced a French and Native American force estimated to number between 300 and 900. The battle, frequently described as an ambush, was actually a &quot;meeting engagement&quot;, where two forces clash at an unexpected time and place. The quick and effective response of the French and Native Americans — despite the early loss of their commander — led many of Braddock&#x27;s men to believe they had been ambushed. However, French battle reports state that while an ambush had been planned, the sudden arrival of the British forced a direct confrontation.

After an exchange of fire, Gage&#x27;s advance group fell back. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with the main body of Braddock&#x27;s force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militiamen and Native Americans enveloped them and began firing from the dense woods on both sides. At this time, the French marines began advancing from the road and blocked any attempt by the British to move forward.

Following Braddock&#x27;s example, the officers kept trying to form their men into standard battle lines so they could fire in formation - a strategy that did little but make the soldiers easy targets. The artillery teams tried to provide covering fire, but there was no space to load the pieces properly and the artillerymen had no protection from enemy sharpshooters. The provincial troops accompanying the British eventually broke ranks and ran into the woods to engage the French; confused by what they thought were enemy reinforcements, panicking British regulars started mistakenly firing on the provincials. After several hours of intense combat, Braddock was fatally shot off his horse, and effective resistance collapsed. Washington, although he had no official position in the chain of command, was able to impose and maintain some order. He formed a rear guard, which allowed the remnants of the force to disengage. This earned him the sobriquet &quot;Hero of the Monongahela&quot;, by which he was toasted, and established his fame for some time to come.

By sunset, the surviving British forces were retreating back down the road they had built. Braddock died of his wounds during the long retreat, on July 13, and is buried within the Fort Necessity parklands. Of the approximately 1,300 men Braddock had led into battle, 456 were killed and 422 wounded. Commissioned officers were prime targets and suffered greatly: out of 86 officers, 26 were killed and 37 wounded. Of the 50 or so women that accompanied the British column as maids and cooks, only 4 survived. The French and Canadians reported 8 killed and 4 wounded; their Native American allies lost 15 killed and 12 wounded.

Colonel Dunbar, with the reserves and rear supply units, took command when the survivors reached his position. He ordered that excess supplies and cannons should be destroyed before withdrawing, burning about 150 wagons on the spot. Ironically, at this point the defeated, demoralized and disorganised British forces still outnumbered their opponents. The French and Native Americans did not pursue; they were far too busy looting dead bodies and collecting scalps. The French commander, Dumas, realized Braddock&#x27;s army was utterly defeated. Yet, to avoid upsetting his men, he did not attempt any further pursuit.

<text>The lapse rate is the rate at which an atmospheric variable, normally temperature in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, falls with altitude. &quot;Lapse rate&quot; arises from the word &quot;lapse&quot; (in its &quot;becoming less&quot; sense, not its &quot;interruption&quot; sense). In dry air, the adiabatic lapse rate (i.e., decrease in temperature of a parcel of air that rises in the atmosphere without exchanging energy with surrounding air) is 9.8 °C/km (5.4 °F per 1,000 ft). The saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR), or moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR), is the decrease in temperature of a parcel of water-saturated air that rises in the atmosphere. It varies with the temperature and pressure of the parcel and is often in the range 3.6 to (2 to ), as obtained from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The environmental lapse rate is the decrease in temperature of air with altitude for a specific time and place (see below). It can be highly variable between circumstances.

Lapse rate corresponds to the vertical component of the spatial gradient of temperature. Although this concept is most often applied to the Earth&#x27;s troposphere, it can be extended to any gravitationally supported parcel of gas.

== Definition ==
A formal definition from the &quot;Glossary of Meteorology&quot; is:
:The decrease of an atmospheric variable with height, the variable being temperature unless otherwise specified.

Typically, the lapse rate is the negative of the rate of temperature change with altitude change:

:formula_1

where formula_2 (sometimes formula_3) is the lapse rate given in units of temperature divided by units of altitude, &quot;T&quot; is temperature, and &quot;z&quot; is altitude.

== Environmental lapse rate ==
The &quot;environmental lapse rate&quot; (ELR), is the actual rate of decrease of temperature with altitude in the atmosphere at a given time and location.

The ELR is the observed lapse rate, and is to be distinguished from the &quot;adiabatic lapse rate&quot; which is a theoretical construct. The ELR is forced towards the adiabatic lapse rate whenever air is moving vertically.

As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of or from sea level to 11 km or . From 11 km up to 20 km or , the constant temperature is , which is the lowest assumed temperature in the ISA. The standard atmosphere contains no moisture. 

Unlike the idealized ISA, the temperature of the actual atmosphere does not always fall at a uniform rate with height. For example, there can be an inversion layer in which the temperature increases with altitude.

== Cause ==

The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of the interaction between radiative heating from sunlight, cooling to space via thermal radiation, and upward heat transport via natural convection (which carries hot air and latent heat upward). Above the tropopause, convection does not occur and all cooling is radiative.

Within the troposphere, the lapse rate is a essentially the consequence of a balance between (a) radiative cooling of the air, which by itself would lead to a high lapse rate; and (b) convection, which is activated when the lapse rate exceeds a critical value; convection stabilizes the environmental lapse rate and prevents it from substantially exceeding the adiabatic lapse rate.

Sunlight hits the surface of the earth (land and sea) and heats them. The warm surface heats the air above it. In addition, nearly a third of absorbed sunlight is absorbed within the atmosphere, heating the atmosphere directly.

Thermal conduction helps transfer heat from the surface to the air; this conduction occurs within the few millimeters of air closest to the surface. However, above that thin interface layer, thermal conduction plays a negligible role in transferring heat within the atmosphere; this is because the thermal conductivity of air is very low.

The air is radiatively cooled by greenhouse gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide, etc.) and clouds emitting longwave thermal radiation to space.

If radiation were the only way to transfer energy within the atmosphere, then the lapse rate near the surface would be roughly 40 °C/km and the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly .

However, when air gets hot or humid, its density decreases. Thus, air which has been heated by the surface tends to rise and carry internal energy upward, especially if the air has been moistened by evaporation from water surfaces. This is the process of convection. Vertical convective motion stops when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as the other air at the same elevation.

Convection carries hot, moist air upward and cold, dry air downward, with a net effect of transferring heat upward. This makes the air below cooler than it would otherwise be and the air above warmer.

When convection happens, this shifts the &quot;environmental lapse rate&quot; towards the &quot;adiabatic lapse rate&quot;, which is a thermal gradient characteristic of vertically moving air packets.

Because convection is available to transfer heat within the atmosphere, the lapse rate in the troposphere is reduced to around 6.5 °C/km and the greenhouse effect is reduced to a point where Earth has its observed surface temperature of around .

== Convection and adiabatic expansion ==
As convection causes parcels of air to rise or fall, there is little heat transfer between those parcels and the surrounding air. Air has low thermal conductivity, and the bodies of air involved are very large; so transfer of heat by conduction is negligibly small. Also, intra-atmospheric radiative heat transfer is relatively slow and so is negligible for moving air. Thus, when air ascends or descends, there is little exchange of heat with the surrounding air. A process in which no heat is exchanged with the environment is referred to as an adiabatic process. 

Air expands as it moves upward, and contracts as it moves downward. The expansion of rising air parcels, and the contraction of descending air parcels, are adiabatic processes, to a good approximation.

When a parcel of air expands, it pushes on the air around it, doing thermodynamic work. Since the upward-moving and expanding parcel does work but gains no heat, it loses internal energy so that its temperature decreases. Downward-moving and contracting air has work done on it, so it gains internal energy and its temperature increases.

Adiabatic processes for air have a characteristic temperature-pressure curve. As air circulates vertically, the air takes on that characteristic gradient. When the air contains little water, this lapse rate is known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate: the rate of temperature decrease is ( per 1,000 ft) (3.0 °C/1,000 ft). The reverse occurs for a sinking parcel of air.

When the environmental lapse rate is less than the adiabatic lapse rate the atmosphere is stable and convection will not occur.

Only the troposphere (up to approximately of altitude) in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere undergoes convection: the stratosphere does not generally convect. However, some exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops associated with severe supercell thunderstorms, may locally and temporarily inject convection through the tropopause and into the stratosphere.

Energy transport in the atmosphere is more complex than the interaction between radiation and dry convection. The water cycle (including evaporation, condensation, precipitation) transports latent heat and affects atmospheric humidity levels, significantly influencing the temperature profile, as described below.

== Mathematics of the adiabatic lapse rate==

The following calculations derive the temperature as a function of altitude for a packet of air which is ascending or descending without exchanging heat with its environment. 

===Dry adiabatic lapse rate===
Thermodynamics defines an adiabatic process as:
:formula_4

the first law of thermodynamics can be written as
:formula_5

Also, since the density formula_6 and formula_7, we can show that:
:formula_8

where formula_9 is the specific heat at constant pressure.

Assuming an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium:
:formula_10

where &quot;g&quot; is the standard gravity. Combining these two equations to eliminate the pressure, one arrives at the result for the &quot;dry adiabatic lapse rate&quot; (DALR),
:formula_11

The DALR (formula_12) is the temperature gradient experienced in an ascending or descending packet of air that is not saturated with water vapor, i.e., with less than 100% relative humidity. 

=== Moist adiabatic lapse rate ===

The presence of water within the atmosphere (usually the troposphere) complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As a parcel of air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated; that is, the vapor pressure of water in equilibrium with liquid water has decreased (as temperature has decreased) to the point where it is equal to the actual vapor pressure of water. With further decrease in temperature the water vapor in excess of the equilibrium amount condenses, forming cloud, and releasing heat (latent heat of condensation). Before saturation, the rising air follows the dry adiabatic lapse rate. After saturation, the rising air follows the moist (or &quot;wet&quot;) adiabatic lapse rate. The release of latent heat is an important source of energy in the development of thunderstorms.

While the dry adiabatic lapse rate is a constant ( per 1,000 ft, ), the moist adiabatic lapse rate varies strongly with temperature. A typical value is around , (, , ). The formula for the &quot;saturated adiabatic lapse rate&quot; (SALR) or &quot;moist adiabatic lapse rate&quot; (MALR) is given by:

:formula_13

where:

The SALR or MALR (formula_14) is the temperature gradient experienced in an ascending or descending packet of air that is saturated with water vapor, i.e., with 100% relative humidity.

== Effect on weather ==
The varying environmental lapse rates throughout the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are of critical importance in meteorology, particularly within the troposphere. They are used to determine if the parcel of rising air will rise high enough for its water to condense to form clouds, and, having formed clouds, whether the air will continue to rise and form bigger shower clouds, and whether these clouds will get even bigger and form cumulonimbus clouds (thunder clouds).

As unsaturated air rises, its temperature drops at the dry adiabatic rate. The dew point also drops (as a result of decreasing air pressure) but much more slowly, typically about per 1,000 m. If unsaturated air rises far enough, eventually its temperature will reach its dew point, and condensation will begin to form. This altitude is known as the lifting condensation level (LCL) when mechanical lift is present and the convective condensation level (CCL) when mechanical lift is absent, in which case, the parcel must be heated from below to its convective temperature. The cloud base will be somewhere within the layer bounded by these parameters.

The difference between the dry adiabatic lapse rate and the rate at which the dew point drops is around per 1,000 m. Given a difference in temperature and dew point readings on the ground, one can easily find the LCL by multiplying the difference by 125 m/°C.

If the environmental lapse rate is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely stable — rising air will cool faster than the surrounding air and lose buoyancy. This often happens in the early morning, when the air near the ground has cooled overnight. Cloud formation in stable air is unlikely.

If the environmental lapse rate is between the moist and dry adiabatic lapse rates, the air is conditionally unstable — an unsaturated parcel of air does not have sufficient buoyancy to rise to the LCL or CCL, and it is stable to weak vertical displacements in either direction. If the parcel is saturated it is unstable and will rise to the LCL or CCL, and either be halted due to an inversion layer of convective inhibition, or if lifting continues, deep, moist convection (DMC) may ensue, as a parcel rises to the level of free convection (LFC), after which it enters the free convective layer (FCL) and usually rises to the equilibrium level (EL).

If the environmental lapse rate is larger than the dry adiabatic lapse rate, it has a superadiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely unstable — a parcel of air will gain buoyancy as it rises both below and above the lifting condensation level or convective condensation level. This often happens in the afternoon mainly over land masses. In these conditions, the likelihood of cumulus clouds, showers or even thunderstorms is increased.

Meteorologists use radiosondes to measure the environmental lapse rate and compare it to the predicted adiabatic lapse rate to forecast the likelihood that air will rise. Charts of the environmental lapse rate are known as thermodynamic diagrams, examples of which include Skew-T log-P diagrams and tephigrams. (See also Thermals).

The difference in moist adiabatic lapse rate and the dry rate is the cause of foehn wind phenomenon (also known as &quot;Chinook winds&quot; in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the dry adiabatic lapse rate, until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the adiabatic lapse rate decreases to the moist adiabatic lapse rate as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain.

== Impact on the greenhouse effect ==
If the environmental lapse rate was zero, so that the atmosphere was the same temperature at all elevations, then there would be no greenhouse effect. This doesn&#x27;t mean the lapse rate and the greenhouse effect are the same thing, just that the lapse rate is a prerequisite for the greenhouse effect.

The presence of greenhouse gases on a planet causes radiative cooling of the air, which leads to the formation of a non-zero lapse rate. So, the presence of greenhouse gases leads to there being a greenhouse effect at a global level. However, this need not be the case at a localized level.

The localized greenhouse effect is stronger in locations where the lapse rate is stronger. In Antarctica, thermal inversions in the atmosphere (so that air at higher altitudes is warmer) sometimes cause the localized greenhouse effect to become negative (signifying enhanced radiative cooling to space instead of inhibited radiative cooling as is the case for a positive greenhouse effect).

== Lapse rate in an isolated column of gas ==

A question has sometimes arisen as to whether a temperature gradient will arise in a column of still air in a gravitational field without external energy flows. This issue was addressed by James Clerk Maxwell in 1902, who established that if any temperature gradient forms, then that temperature gradient must be universal (i.e., the gradient must be same for all materials) or the second law of thermodynamics would be violated. Maxwell also concluded that the universal result must be one in which the temperature is uniform, i.e., the lapse rate is zero.

Santiago and Visser (2019) confirm the correctness of Maxwell&#x27;s conclusion (zero lapse rate) provided relativistic effects are neglected. When relativity is taken into account, gravity gives rise to an extremely small lapse rate, the Tolman gradient (derived by R. C. Tolman in 1930). At Earth&#x27;s surface, the Tolman gradient would be about formula_15mformula_16, where formula_17 is the temperature of the gas at the elevation of Earth&#x27;s surface. Santiago and Visser remark that &quot;gravity is the only force capable of creating temperature gradients in thermal equilibrium states without violating the laws of thermodynamics&quot; and &quot;the existence of Tolman&#x27;s temperature gradient is not at all controversial (at least not within the general relativity community).&quot;

<doc id="224314" wikidata="Q532329" url="?curid=224314" title="George Mason">
<text>George Mason (October 7, 1792) was an American planter, politician, Founding Father, and delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, where he was one of three delegates who refused to sign the Constitution. His writings, including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and his &quot;Objections to this Constitution of Government&quot; (1787) opposing ratification, have exercised a significant influence on American political thought and events. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights, of which he has been deemed a father.

Mason was born in 1725 in present-day Fairfax County, Virginia. His father drowned when a storm capsized his boat while crossing the Potomac River in 1735 when Mason was about nine years old. His mother managed the family estates until he came of age. In 1750, Mason married, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and involved himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Great Britain and the North American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, using his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention in 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776.

Mason prepared the first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776, and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Revolutionary Virginia Convention. He also wrote a constitution for the state; Thomas Jefferson and others sought to have the convention adopt their ideas, but Mason&#x27;s version was nonetheless adopted. During the American Revolutionary War, Mason was a member of the powerful House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly, but to the irritation of Washington and others, he refused to serve in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, citing health and family commitments.

In 1787, Mason was named one of his state&#x27;s delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, his only lengthy trip outside Virginia. Many clauses in the Constitution were influenced by Mason&#x27;s input, but he ultimately did not sign the final version, citing the lack of a bill of rights among his most prominent objections. He also wanted an immediate end to the slave trade and a supermajority requirement for navigation acts, fearing that restrictions on shipping might harm Virginia. He failed to attain these objectives in Philadelphia and later at the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788. His prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian James Madison to introduce the same during the First Congress in 1789; these amendments were ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died. Obscure after his death, Mason later came to be recognized in the 20th and 21st centuries for his contributions to Virginia and the early United States.

==Early life and education==
Mason was born in present-day Fairfax County, in the Colony of Virginia, in British America, on December 11, 1725. Mason&#x27;s parents owned property in Mason Neck, Virginia and a second property across the Potomac River in Maryland, which had been inherited by his mother. 

Mason&#x27;s great-grandfather George Mason I was a Cavalier who was born in 1629 in Pershore, Worcestershire, England. Militarily defeated in the English Civil War, Mason and other Cavaliers emigrated to the American colonies in the 1640s and 1650s. Mason I settled in present-day Stafford County, Virginia, where he was awarded land as a reward for bringing his family and servants to the Colony of Virginia, under headright, which awarded 50 acres for each person transported into the Colony. His son, George Mason II (1660–1716), was the first to move to what in 1742 became Fairfax County, then at the frontier between English and Native American controlled areas. George Mason III (1690–1735) like his father and grandfather served in the House of Burgesses and also as county lieutenant. George Mason IV&#x27;s mother, Ann Thomson Mason, was the daughter of a former Attorney General of Virginia who immigrated from England.

Colonial Virginia at the time had few roads, and boats carried most commerce on Chesapeake Bay or its tributaries, including the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. Most settlement took place near the rivers, through which planters could trade with the world. Colonial Virginia initially had few towns, since estates were largely self-sufficient and could obtain what they needed without the need to purchase locally. Even the capital, Williamsburg, had limited economic activity when the legislature was not in session. Local politics was dominated by large landowners, including the Masons. The Virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco, the main crop, which was raised mostly for export to Great Britain.

In 1736, Mason began his education with a Mr. Williams, who was hired to teach Mason for the price of of tobacco per annum. His studies began at his mother&#x27;s house. But the following year, he boarded with a Mrs. Simpson in Maryland, and Williams continued as his teacher through 1739. By 1740, Mason was at Chopawamsic, under the tutelage of a Dr. Bridges, likely Charles Bridges, who helped develop the British schools run by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, and arrived in British America in 1731. Mason and his brother Thomson likely utilized John Francis Mercer&#x27;s library, one of the largest in Virginia at the time. Conversations with Mercer and book-lovers who gathered around him could have continued his education informally.

==Career==
===Fairfax County===
The obligations and offices that came with being one of the largest local landowners descended on Mason as they had previously on his father and grandfather. In 1747, Mason was named to the Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, and was elected as a vestryman at Truro Parish, where he served between 1749 and 1785. He took a position among the officers of the Fairfax County militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel.

The county court heard civil and criminal cases, and also decided matters such as local taxes. Membership fell to most major landowners. Mason was a justice for much of the rest of his life, though he was excluded because of nonattendance at court from 1752 to 1764, and he resigned in 1789 when continued service meant swearing to uphold a constitution he could not support. Even while a member, he often did not attend. Joseph Horrell, in a journal article on Mason&#x27;s court service, noted that he was often in poor health and lived the furthest of any of the major estateholders from the Fairfax County courthouse, whether at its original site near today&#x27;s Tyson&#x27;s Corner or later in newly founded Alexandria. Robert Rutland, editor of Mason&#x27;s papers, considered court service a major influence on Mason&#x27;s later thinking and writing, but Horrell denied it, &quot;if the Fairfax court provided a course for Mason&#x27;s early training, he chiefly distinguished himself by skipping classes.&quot;

Alexandria was one of the towns founded or given corporate status in the mid-18th century in which Mason had interests; he purchased three of the original lots along King and Royal Streets and became a municipal trustee in 1754. He also served as a trustee of Dumfries, in Prince William County, and had business interests there and in Georgetown, on the Maryland side of the Potomac River in present-day Washington, D.C.

In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by more senior members of the court and he was not then successful, but he later emerged victorious in 1758.

===Gunston Hall===


On April 4, 1750, Mason married Ann Eilbeck, only child of William and Sarah Eilbeck of Charles County, Maryland. The Masons and Eilbecks had adjacent lands in Maryland and had joined together in real estate transactions; by his death in 1764, William Eilbeck was one of the wealthiest men in Charles County. At the time of his marriage, Mason was living at Dogue&#x27;s Neck, possibly at Sycamore Point. George and Ann Mason had nine children who survived to adulthood. Ann Mason died in 1773; their marriage, judging by surviving accounts, was a happy one.

Mason began to build his home, Gunston Hall, in or around 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America for the use of local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens, which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and the shops and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.

Mason avoided overdependence on tobacco as a source of income by leasing much of his land holdings to tenant farmers, and he diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to the British West Indies as Virginia&#x27;s economy sank because of tobacco overproduction in the 1760s and 1770s. Mason was a pioneer in the Virginia wine industry. Along with Thomas Jefferson, Mason and other Virginians subscribed to a scheme for growing wine grapes in America developed by Filippo Mazzei.

Mason greatly ultimately expanded the boundaries of Gunston Hall estate, so that it occupied all of Dogue&#x27;s Neck, which became known as Mason&#x27;s Neck. One project that Mason was involved in for most of his adult life was the Ohio Company, in which he invested in 1749 and became treasurer in 1752—an office he held forty years until his death in 1792. The Ohio Company had secured a royal grant for to be surveyed near the forks of the Ohio River in present-day Pittsburgh. The challenges of the French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, and competing claims from the Province of Pennsylvania eventually led to the collapse of the Ohio Company. Although the company failed, Mason acquired considerable western lands independently. His defense against the Pennsylvania claims, &quot;Selections from the Virginia Charters&quot;, written in 1772, originally intended to promote the Ohio Company&#x27;s claims, was widely applauded as a defense of the rights of Americans against royal decrees. 

Involvement with the Ohio Company also brought Mason into contact with many prominent Virginians, including George Washington, his Fairfax County neighbor. Mason and George Washington were friends for many years until they finally broke over their differences regarding the federal constitution. Peter R. Henriques, in a journal article on the relationship between Mason and Washington, suggests that Mason cultivated the friendship more than Washington. Mason sent many more letters and gifts and stayed more often at Washington&#x27;s residence at Mount Vernon, though this might be explained in part by the fact that Mount Vernon was located on the road from Gunston Hall to Alexandria. Henriques suggests that as Mason was older, intellectually superior, and the owner of a flourishing plantation as Washington was struggling to establish Mount Vernon, and it would not have been in the future president&#x27;s character to seek a close relationship with Mason. Washington, however, had deep respect for Mason&#x27;s intellectual abilities, and sought Mason&#x27;s advice on several occasions, writing in 1777 when learning that Mason had taken charge of an issue before the General Assembly, &quot;I know of no person better qualified ... than Colonel Mason, and shall be very happy to hear he has taken it in hand&quot;.

Despite his involvement in western real estate, Mason saw that land was being cleared and planted with tobacco faster than the market for it could expand, meaning that its price would drop even as more and more capital was tied up in land and slaves. Thus, although a major slaveholder, he opposed the slave system in Virginia. He believed that slave importation, together with the natural population increase, would result in a huge future slave population in Virginia; a system of leased lands, though not as profitable as slave labor, would have &quot;little Trouble &amp; Risque [risk]&quot;.

===Virginia House of Burgesses===
Little is known of Mason&#x27;s political views prior to the 1760s, when he came to oppose British colonial policies. In 1758, Mason successfully ran for the House of Burgesses when George William Fairfax, holder of one of Fairfax County&#x27;s two seats, chose not to seek reelection. Also elected were Mason&#x27;s brother Thomson for Stafford County, George Washington for Frederick County, where he was stationed as commander of Virginia&#x27;s militia during the French and Indian War, and Richard Henry Lee, who worked closely with Mason through their careers.

When the House of Burgesses assembled, Mason was initially appointed to a committee concerned with raising additional militia during that time of war. In 1759, he was appointed to the powerful Committee on Privileges and Elections. He was also placed on the Committee on Propositions and Grievances, which mostly considered local matters. Mason dealt with several local concerns, presenting a petition of Fairfax County planters against being assessed for a tobacco wharf at Alexandria, funds they felt should be raised through wharfage fees. He also played a major role as the Burgesses deliberated how to divide Prince William County as settlement expanded; in March 1759, Fauquier County was created by legislative act. In this, Mason opposed the interest of the family of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who wanted existing counties expanded instead, including Fairfax. This difference may have contributed to Mason&#x27;s decision not to seek re-election in 1761. Mason biographer Jeff Broadwater notes that Mason&#x27;s committee assignments reflected the esteem his colleagues held him in, or at least the potential they saw. Broadwater did not find it surprising that Mason did not seek re-election, as he did not attend the sessions between 1759 and 1761.

Although the British were victorious over the French in the war, King George III&#x27;s government felt that the North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had the same rights as if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.

Mason slowly moved from being a peripheral figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable for the inclusion of his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason&#x27;s advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow for one of the most common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County&#x27;s burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.

Following the repeal, a committee of London merchants issued a public letter to Americans, warning them not to declare victory. Mason published a response in June 1766, satirizing the British position, &quot;We have, with infinite Difficulty &amp; Fatigue got you excused this one Time; do what your Papa and Mamma bid, &amp; hasten to return your most grateful Acknowledgements for condescending to let you keep what is your own.&quot; The Townshend Acts of 1767 were Britain&#x27;s next attempt to tax the colonies, placing duties on substances including lead and glass, which provoked calls from the northern colonies for a boycott of British goods. Virginia, more dependent on goods imported from Britain, was less enthusiastic, and as local planters tended to receive goods at their river landings, a boycott would be difficult to enforce. In April 1769, Washington sent a copy of a Philadelphia resolution to Mason, asking his advice on what action Virginia should take. It is unknown who adapted that text for use in Virginia (Broadwater concludes it was Mason) but Mason sent Washington a corrected draft on April 23, 1769. Washington took it to Williamsburg, but the governor, Lord Botetourt, dissolved the legislature because of the radical resolutions it was passing. The Burgesses adjourned to a nearby tavern and there passed a non-importation agreement based on Mason&#x27;s draft.

Although the resolution did not threaten to cut off tobacco, as Mason wanted, he worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would require him departing Gunston Hall.

===Revolutionary War===
In May 1774, Mason was in Williamsburg on real estate business. Word had just arrived of the passage of the Intolerable Acts, as Americans dubbed the legislative response to the Boston Tea Party, and a group of lawmakers including Lee, Henry, and Jefferson asked Mason to join them in formulating a course of action. The Burgesses passed a resolution for a day of fasting and prayer to obtain divine intervention against &quot;destruction of our Civil Rights&quot;, but the governor, Lord Dunmore, dissolved the legislature rather than accept it. Mason may have helped write the resolution and likely joined the members after the dissolution when they met at Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.

New elections had to be held for burgess and for delegate to the convention which had been called by the rump of the dissolved House of Burgesses, and Fairfax County&#x27;s were set for July 5, 1774. George Washington planned to run for one seat and tried to get Mason or Bryan Fairfax to seek the other, but both men declined. Although the poll was postponed to July 14 because of poor weather, Washington met that day with other local leaders (including, likely, Mason) in Alexandria and selected a committee to draft a set of resolutions, which Washington hoped would &quot;define our Constitutional Rights&quot;. The resulting Fairfax Resolves were largely drafted by Mason. He met with Washington on July 17 at Mount Vernon and stayed the night; the two men rode together to Alexandria the following day. The 24 propositions that made up the Resolves protested loyalty to the British Crown but denied the right of Parliament to legislate for colonies that had been settled at private expense and which had received charters from the monarch. The Resolves called for a continental congress. If Americans did not receive redress by November 1, exports, including that of tobacco, would be cut off. The freeholders of Fairfax County approved the Resolves, appointing Mason and Washington to a special committee in the emergency. According to early Virginia historian Hugh Grigsby, at Alexandria, Mason &quot;made his first great movement on the theatre of the Revolution&quot;.

Washington took the Resolves to the Virginia Convention in Williamsburg. Although delegates made some changes, the adopted resolution closely tracked both the Fairfax Resolves and the scheme for non-exportation of tobacco Mason had proposed some years earlier. The convention elected delegates to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, including Lee, Washington, and Henry, and in October 1774, Congress adopted a similar embargo.

Much of Mason&#x27;s efforts in 1774 and 1775 was in organizing a militia independent of the royal government. Washington by January 1775 was drilling a small force, and he and Mason purchased gunpowder for the company. Mason wrote in favor of annual election of militia officers in words that would later echo in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, &quot;We came equal into this world, and equals shall we go out of it. All men are by nature born equally free and independent.&quot;

Washington&#x27;s election as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress created a vacancy in Fairfax County&#x27;s delegation to the third Virginia Convention. In May 1775, Washington wrote from Philadelphia, urging that the vacancy be filled. By this time, blood had been shed between American patriot militias and the British Army at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which launched the American Revolutionary War. Mason attempted to avoid election on the grounds of poor health and his obligations as a single parent to nine children. Nevertheless, he was elected and journeyed to Richmond, which, being further inland than Williamsburg, was deemed better protected from possible British attack.

When the Richmond convention began in July 1775, Mason was assigned to crucial committees, including one attempting to raise an army to protect the colony. According to Robert A. Rutland, &quot;Sick or healthy, Mason was needed for his ability.&quot; Mason sponsored a non-exportation measure; it was passed by a large majority, though it had to be repealed later in the session to coordinate with one passed by Maryland. Despite pressure from many delegates, Mason refused to consider election as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in place of Washington after the Congress elected Washington commanding general of the Continental Army. But Mason could not avoid election to the Committee of Safety, a powerful group that took over many functions in the governmental vacuum. Mason proffered his resignation from this committee, but it was refused.

===Declaration of Rights===

Illness forced Mason to abstain himself from the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, and he did not attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With independence from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need to decide how Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as so important that Lee arranged for his temporary recall from Congress to be a part of the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, George Wythe, and a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.
That convention, in May 1776, unanimously instructed Jefferson and other Virginia delegates to Congress to seek &quot;a clear and full Declaration of Independency&quot;. At the same time, the convention resolved to pass a declaration of rights. Ill health delayed Mason&#x27;s arrival until May 18, 1776, after the vote, but he was appointed to a committee led by Archibald Cary, which was to compose a declaration of rights and constitution. Mason was skeptical that the thirty-person Cary Committee could collectively compose anything worthwhile, but he was surprised at how quickly it moved—though his membership had a role in that speed. On May 24, convention president Edmund Pendleton wrote to Jefferson about the committee&#x27;s deliberations, &quot;as Colo.[nel] Mason seems to have the ascendancy in the great work, I have Sanguine hopes it will be framed so as to Answer it&#x27;s end, Prosperity to the Community and Security to Individuals&quot;.

Mason, working in a room at the Raleigh Tavern, drafted a declaration of rights and plan of government, likely to prevent frivolous plans with no chance of adoption from being put forward. Edmund Randolph later recalled that Mason&#x27;s draft &quot;swallowed up all the rest&quot;. The Virginia Declaration of Rights and the 1776 Constitution of Virginia were joint works, but Mason was the main author. Mason likely worked closely with Thomas Ludwell Lee; the earliest surviving draft shows the first ten articles in Mason&#x27;s handwriting, with the other two written by Lee. The draft for the Declaration of Rights drew on Magna Carta, the English Petition of Right of 1628, and that nation&#x27;s 1689 Bill of Rights. Mason&#x27;s first article would be paraphrased by Jefferson soon after in drafting the American Declaration of Independence.

From the first article, cataloguing the rights of man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear that the role of government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the people have a right to amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner&#x27;s consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.

When the convention began to debate the declaration, it quickly bogged down on the first sentence of Article 1, which some feared would imply that slaves were their masters&#x27; equals. This was resolved by the convention adding the words &quot;when they enter into a state of society&quot;, thus excluding slaves. Mason spoke repeatedly in the five days of debate, using oratory one hearer described as &quot;neither flowing nor smooth, but his language was strong, his manner most impressive, and strengthened by a bit of biting cynicism when provocation made it seasonable&quot;. The Declaration of Rights was passed by the convention on June 12, 1776.

There later was a flurry of contradictory statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but Article 16 (dealing with religious freedom), had been written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison&#x27;s amendment once made.

The committee draft, likely for the most part written by Mason, received wide publicity (the final version much less so) and Mason&#x27;s words &quot;all men are born equally free and independent&quot; were later reproduced in state constitutions from Pennsylvania to Montana; Jefferson tweaked the prose and included the sentiments in the Declaration of Independence. In 1778, Mason wrote that the Declaration of Rights &quot;was closely imitated by the other United States&quot;. This was true, as seven of the original states, and Vermont, joined Virginia in promulgating a bill of rights. Four in addition specified rights that were protected, within the body of their constitutions. Feelings were so strong in Massachusetts that voters there in 1778 rejected a constitution drafted by a convention, insisting that a bill of rights had to come first.

===Virginia constitution===
Even before the convention approved the Declaration of Rights, Mason was busy at work on a constitution for Virginia. He was not the only one occupying himself so; Jefferson sent several versions from Philadelphia, one of which supplied the constitution&#x27;s preamble. Essex County&#x27;s Meriwether Smith may have prepared a draft, but the text is unknown. As an original writing in Mason&#x27;s hand is not known, the extent to which the final draft was written by him is uncertain. On June 22, 1776, however, William Fleming sent Jefferson a copy of the draft before the Cary Committee, telling him &quot;the inclosed printed plan was drawn by Colo. G. Mason and by him laid before the committee&quot;.

Mason had submitted his plan sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named the new state the &quot;Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;, a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected House of Delegates, chosen annually by men who owned or leased property, or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill and could only act as head of the state militia on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson&#x27;s preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson&#x27;s draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on June 29. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution&#x27;s passage by unanimous vote, &quot;I have had the pleasure to see our new plan of Government go on well. This day will put a finishing hand to it. &#x27;Tis very much of the democratic kind.&quot;

When the convention chose Patrick Henry as Virginia&#x27;s first post-independence governor, Mason led the committee of notables sent to inform Henry of his election. There was criticism of the constitution—Edmund Randolph later wrote that the document&#x27;s faults indicated that even such a great mind as Mason&#x27;s was not immune from &quot;oversights and negligences&quot;: it did not have an amending process and granted two delegates to each county regardless of population. The 1776 constitution remained in force until 1830, when another convention replaced it. According to Henry C. Riely in his journal article on Mason, &quot;The Virginia Constitution of 1776, whatever may have been the question raised long afterwards as to the contribution of other great leaders, stands, on the authority of Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph—to mention only the highest authority—as his creation.&quot;

===Revolutionary War legislator===

Mason devoted much effort during the American Revolutionary War to safeguarding Fairfax County and the rivers of Virginia, since the British several times raided areas along the Potomac. Control of the rivers and of Chesapeake Bay was urgent as Virginians tried to obtain hard currency by trading tobacco to the French and other European nations. The export of tobacco, generally via the West Indies, allowed Mason and others to obtain, via France and Holland, British-made items such as cloth, clothing patterns, medicines, and hardware.

Mason served as a member of the House of Delegates from 1776 to 1781, his longest continuous political service outside Fairfax County, which he represented in Richmond. The other Fairfax County seat turned over several times—Washington&#x27;s stepson Jackie Custis was elected late in the war—but Mason remained the county&#x27;s choice throughout. Nevertheless, Mason&#x27;s health often caused him to miss meetings of the legislature, or to arrive days or weeks late. Mason in 1777 was assigned to a committee to revise Virginia&#x27;s laws, with the expectation that he would take on the criminal code and land law. Mason served a few months on the committee before resigning on the ground he was not a lawyer; most of the work fell to Jefferson (returned from Philadelphia), Pendleton, and Wythe. Illness caused by a botched smallpox inoculation forced Mason to miss part of the legislature&#x27;s spring 1777 session; in his absence delegates on May 22 elected him to the Continental Congress. Mason, who may have been angry that Lee had not been chosen, refused on the ground that he was needed at home and did not feel he could resign from the General Assembly without permission from his constituents. Lee was elected in his place.

This did not end the desire of Virginians to send Mason to the Continental Congress. In 1779, Lee resigned from Congress, expressing the hope that Mason, Wythe, or Jefferson would replace him in Philadelphia. General Washington was frustrated at the reluctance of many talented men to serve in Congress, writing to Benjamin Harrison that the states &quot;should compel their ablest men to attend Congress ... Where is Mason, Wythe, Jefferson, Nicholas, Pendleton, Nelson?&quot; Washington wrote to Mason directly:

In spite of Washington&#x27;s pleas, Mason remained in Virginia, plagued by illness and heavily occupied on the Committee of Safety and elsewhere in defending the Fairfax County area. Most of the legislation Mason introduced in the House of Delegates was war related, often aimed at raising the men or money needed by Congress for Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. The new federal and state governments, short on cash, issued paper money. By 1777, the value of Virginia&#x27;s paper money had dropped precipitously, and Mason developed a plan to redeem the notes with a tax on real estate. Mason was three weeks late in arriving at Richmond because of his illness, to the frustration of Washington, who had faith in Mason&#x27;s knowledge of financial affairs. Washington wrote to Custis, &quot;It is much to be wished that a remedy could be applied to the depreciation of our Currency ... I know of no person better qualified to do this than Colonel Mason&quot;.

Mason retained his interest in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company&#x27;s land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark&#x27;s expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George Mason), the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, was unfavorable to Virginia, he voted for it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, who had never been married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able to take some of the burden of parenting Mason&#x27;s many children off his hands.

===Post-Revolutionary War===
Following the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which established an sovereign United States and largely ended armed hostilities, life along the Potomac River returned to normal. In December 1783, Madison returned to Gunston Hall after returning from the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In 1781, the Articles of Confederation had tied the states in a loose bond, and Madison sought a more sound federal structure, seeking the proper balance between federal and state rights. He found Mason willing to consider a federal tax; Madison had feared the subject might offend his host and wrote to Jefferson of the evening&#x27;s conversation. The same month, Mason spent Christmas at Mount Vernon (the only larger estate than his in Fairfax County). A fellow houseguest described Mason as &quot;slight in figure, but not tall, and has a grand head and clear gray eyes&quot;. Mason retained his political influence in Virginia, writing Patrick Henry, who had been elected to the House of Delegates, a letter filled with advice as that body&#x27;s 1783 session opened.

Mason scuttled efforts to elect him to the House of Delegates in 1784, writing that sending him to Richmond would be &quot;an oppressive and unjust invasion of my personal liberty&quot;. His refusal disappointed Jefferson, who had hoped that the likelihood that the legislature would consider land legislation would attract Mason to Richmond. The legislature nevertheless appointed Mason a commissioner to negotiate with Maryland over navigation of the Potomac. Mason spent much time on this issue and reached agreement with Maryland delegates at the meeting in March 1785 known as the Mount Vernon Conference. Although the meeting at Washington&#x27;s home came later to be seen as a first step towards the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Mason saw it simply as efforts by two states to resolve differences between them. Mason was appointed to the Annapolis Convention of 1786, at which representatives of all the states were welcome, but like most delegates he did not attend. The sparsely attended Annapolis meeting called for a conference to consider amendments to the Articles of Confederation.

To deter smuggling, Madison proposed a bill to make Norfolk the state&#x27;s only legal port of entry. Five other ports, including Alexandria, were eventually added, but the Port Act proved unpopular despite the support of Washington. Mason, an opponent of the act, accepted election to the House of Delegates in 1786, and many believed that his influence would prove decisive for the repeal effort. Mason did not come to Richmond during the initial session because of illness, but he did send a petition as a private citizen to the legislature. The Port Act survived, though additional harbors were added as legal entry points.

===Constitutional Convention (1787)===

Although the Annapolis Convention saw only about a dozen delegates attend, representing only five states, it called for a meeting to be held in Philadelphia in May 1787 to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth&#x27;s delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and John Blair. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to James McClurg. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention&#x27;s scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).

The journey to Philadelphia was Mason&#x27;s first beyond Virginia and Maryland. According to Josephine T. Pacheco in her article about Mason&#x27;s role at Philadelphia, &quot;since Virginia&#x27;s leaders regarded [Mason] as a wise, trustworthy man, it is not surprising that they chose him as a member of the Virginia delegation, though they must have been surprised when he accepted&quot;. Broadwater suggests that Mason went to Philadelphia because he knew the federal congress needed additional power and because he felt that body could act as a check on the powers of state legislatures. As the Virginians waited for the other delegates to arrive, they met each day and formulated what became known as the Virginia Plan. They also did some sightseeing and were presented to Pennsylvania&#x27;s president, Benjamin Franklin. Within a week of arrival, Mason was bored with the social events to which the delegates were invited, &quot;I begin to grow tired of the etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city&quot;.

Going into the convention, Mason wanted to see a more powerful central government than under the Articles, but not one that would threaten local interests. He feared that the more numerous Northern states would dominate the union and would impose restrictions on trade that would harm Virginia, so he sought a supermajority requirement for navigation acts. As was his constant objective, he sought to preserve the liberty he and other free white men enjoyed in Virginia, guarding against the tyranny he and others had decried under British rule. He also sought a balance of powers, seeking thereby to make a durable government; according to historian Brent Tarter, &quot;Mason designed his home [Gunston Hall] so that no misplaced window or missing support might spoil the effect or threaten to bring down the roof; he tried to design institutions of government in the same way, so that wicked or unprincipled men could not knock loose any safeguards of liberty&quot;.

Mason had hope, coming into the convention, that it would yield a result that he felt would strengthen the United States. Impressed by the quality of the delegates, Mason expected sound thinking from them, something he did not think he had often encountered in his political career. Still, he felt that the &quot;hopes of all the Union centre in this Convention&quot;, and wrote to his son George, &quot;the revolt from Great Britain &amp; the Formations of our new Government at that time, were nothing compared with the great Business now before us.&quot;
Mason knew few of the delegates who were not from Virginia or Maryland, but his reputation preceded him. Once delegates representing sufficient states had arrived in Philadelphia by late May, the convention held closed sessions at the Pennsylvania State House (today Independence Hall). Washington was elected the convention&#x27;s president by unanimous vote, and his tremendous personal prestige as the victorious war general helped legitimize the convention but also caused him to abstain from debate. Mason had no such need to remain silent, and only four or five delegates spoke as frequently as he did. Though he ended up not signing the constitution, according to Broadwater, Mason won as many convention debates as he lost.

In the early days of the convention, Mason supported much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more powerful than the states.

The Virginia Plan, if implemented, would base representation in both houses of the federal legislature on population. This was unsatisfactory to the smaller states. Delaware&#x27;s delegates had been instructed to seek an equal vote for each state, and this became the New Jersey Plan, introduced by that New Jersey Governor William Paterson. The divisions in the convention became apparent in late June, when by a narrow vote, the convention voted that representation in the lower house be based on population, but the motion of Connecticut&#x27;s Oliver Ellsworth for each state to have an equal vote in the upper house failed on a tie. With the convention deadlocked, on July 2, 1787, a grand committee was formed, with one member from each state, to seek a way out. Mason had not taken as strong a position on the legislature as had Madison, and he was appointed to the committee; Mason and Franklin were the most prominent members. The committee met over the convention&#x27;s July 4 recess and proposed what became known as the Great Compromise: a House of Representatives based on population, in which money bills must originate, and a Senate with equal representation for each state. Records do not survive of Mason&#x27;s participation in that committee, but the clause requiring money bills to start in the House most likely came from him or was the price of his support, as he had inserted such a clause in the Virginia Constitution, and he defended that clause once convention debate resumed. According to Madison&#x27;s notes, Mason urged the convention to adopt the compromise:

===Road to dissent===
By mid-July, as delegates began to move past the stalemate to a framework built upon the Great Compromise, Mason had considerable influence in the convention. North Carolina&#x27;s William Blount was unhappy that those from his state &quot;were in Sentiment with Virginia who seemed to take the lead. Madison at their Head tho Randolph and Mason also great&quot;. Mason had failed to carry his proposals that senators must own property and not be in debt to the United States, but he successfully argued that the minimum age for service in Congress should be 25, telling the convention that younger men were too immature. Mason was the first to propose that the national seat of government not be in a state capital lest the local legislature be too influential. He voted against proposals to base representation on a state&#x27;s wealth or taxes paid and supported regular reapportionment of the House of Representatives.

On August 6, 1787, the convention received a tentative draft written by a Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina&#x27;s John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason as a basis for discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.

The convention spent several weeks in August debating the powers of Congress. Although Mason was successful in some of his proposals, such as placing the state militias under federal regulation and a ban on Congress passing an export tax, he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and not be subject to amendment in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.

On August 31, 1787, Massachusetts&#x27;s Elbridge Gerry spoke against the document as a whole, as did Luther Martin of Maryland. When Gerry moved to postpone consideration of the final document, Mason seconded him, stating, according to Madison, that &quot;he would sooner chop off his right hand than put it to the Constitution as it now stands&quot;. Still, Mason did not rule out signing it, saying that he wanted to see how certain matters still before the convention were settled before deciding a final position, whether to sign or ask for a second convention. As the final touches were made to the constitution, Mason and Gerry held meetings in the evening to discuss strategy, bringing in delegates representing states from Connecticut to Georgia.
Mason&#x27;s misgivings about the constitution were increased on September 12, when Gerry proposed and Mason seconded that there be a committee appointed to write a bill of rights, to be part of the text of the constitution. Connecticut&#x27;s Roger Sherman noted that the state bills of rights would remain in force, to which Mason responded, &quot;the Laws of the United States are to be paramount [supreme] to State Bills of Rights.&quot; Although Massachusetts abstained in deference to Gerry, the Virginians showed no desire to conciliate Mason in their votes, as the motion failed with no states in favor and ten opposed. Also on September 12, the Committee on Style submitted its final draft, and Mason began to list objections on his copy. On September 15, as the convention continued a clause-by-clause consideration of the draft, Mason, Randolph, and Gerry stated they would not sign the constitution.

On September 17, members of the twelve delegations then present in Philadelphia signed the constitution, except for the three men who had stated they would not. As the document was sent to the Articles of Confederation&#x27;s Congress in New York, Mason sent a copy of his objections to Richard Henry Lee, a member of the Congress.

==Ratification battle==
Broadwater notes, &quot;given the difficulty of the task he had set for himself, his stubborn independence, and his lack, by 1787, of any concern for his own political future, it is not surprising that he left Philadelphia at odds with the great majority of his fellow delegates&quot;. Madison recorded that Mason, believing that the convention had given his proposals short shrift in a hurry to complete its work, began his journey back to Virginia &quot;in an exceeding ill humor&quot;. Mason biographer Helen Hill Miller notes that before Mason returned to Gunston Hall, he was injured in body as well as spirit after an accident on the road. Word of Mason&#x27;s opposition stance had reached Fairfax County even before the convention ended; most local sentiment was in favor of the document. Washington made a statement urging ratification but otherwise remained silent, knowing he would almost certainly be the first president. Mason sent Washington a copy of his objections, but Washington believed that the choice was ratification or disaster.

The constitution was to be ratified by state conventions, with nine approvals necessary for it to come into force. In practice, opposition by large states such as New York or Virginia would make it hard for the new government to function. Mason remained a member of the House of Delegates, and in late October 1787, the legislature called a convention for June 1788; in language crafted by John Marshall, it decreed that the Virginia Ratifying Convention would be allowed &quot;free and ample discussion&quot;. Mason was less influential in his final session in the House of Delegates because of his strong opposition to ratification, and his age (61) may also have caused him to be less effective.

As smaller states ratified the constitution in late 1787 and early 1788, there was an immense quantity of pamphlets and other written matter for and against approval. Most prominent in support were the pamphlets later collected as &quot;The Federalist&quot;, written by Madison and two New Yorkers, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay; Mason&#x27;s objections were widely cited by opponents. Mason had begun his &quot;Objections to this Constitution of Government&quot; in Philadelphia; in October 1787, it was published, though without his permission. Madison complained that Mason had gone beyond the reasons for opposing he had stated in convention, but Broadwater suggested the major difference was one of tone, since the written work dismissed as useless the constitution and the proposed federal government. Nevertheless, both Lee and Mason believed that if proper amendments were made, the constitution would be a fine instrument of governance. The &quot;Objections&quot; were widely cited in opposition to ratification, and Mason was criticized for placing his own name on it, at a time when political tracts were signed, if at all, with pen names such as Junius, so that the author&#x27;s reputation would not influence the debate. Despite this, Mason&#x27;s &quot;Objections&quot; were among the most influential Anti-Federalist works, and its opening line, &quot;There is no Declaration of Rights&quot;, likely their most effective slogan.

Virginians were reluctant to believe that greatly respected figures such as Washington and Franklin would be complicit in setting up a tyrannical system. There were broad attacks on Mason; the New Haven &quot;Gazette&quot; suggested that he had not done much for his country during the war, in marked contrast to Washington. Oliver Ellsworth blamed the Virginia opposition on the Lee family, who had long had tensions with the Washington family, and on &quot;the madness of Mason&quot;. Tarter, in his &quot;American National Biography&quot; article on Mason, wrote that &quot;the rigidity of [Mason&#x27;s] views and his increasingly belligerent personality produced an intolerance and intemperance in his behavior that surprised and angered Madison, with whom he had worked closely at the beginning of the convention, and Washington, who privately condemned Mason&#x27;s actions during the ratification struggle.&quot;

In Richmond from October 1787 until January 1788 representing Fairfax County in the House of Delegates, Mason faced difficulties in winning election to the ratifying convention from his home county, since most Fairfax freeholders were Federalist, and local courthouse politics put him at odds with many in Alexandria. The statute governing elections to the convention in Richmond allowed Mason to seek election where he owned property, and he sought election in Stafford County. He assured voters that he did not seek disunion, but rather reform, and spoke against the unamended constitution in strong terms. George Nicholas, a Federalist friend of Mason, believed that Mason felt he could lead Virginia to gain concessions from the other states, and that he was embittered by the continuing attacks on him. On March 10, 1788, Mason finished first in the polls in Stafford County, and veteran delegate Andrew Buchanan won the other seat over Colonel Carter and William Fitzhugh. Two days later, a Richmond essayist criticized Mason and Richard Henry Lee (who did not attend) for the &quot;barefaced impudence and folly&quot; of public protests. Mason apparently was the only person elected to that convention for a constituency in which he did not live (although historically many of his ancestors had lived in and represented the county). Voter turnout was low, as many in remote areas without newspapers knew little about the constitution. The Federalists were believed to have a slight advantage in elected delegates; Mason thought that the convention would be unlikely to ratify the document without demanding amendments.

By the time the Richmond convention opened in June, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played into the hands of the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason&#x27;s motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the president would use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot; (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.

The federalists initially did not have a majority, with the balance held by undeclared delegates, mainly from western Virginia (today&#x27;s Kentucky). The Anti-Federalists suffered repeated blows during the convention due to the defection of Randolph and as news came other states had ratified. Mason led a group of Anti-Federalists which drafted amendments: even the Federalists were open to supporting them, though the constitution&#x27;s supporters wanted the document drafted in Philadelphia ratified first.

After some of the Kentuckians had declared for ratification, the convention considered a resolution to withhold ratification pending the approval of a declaration of rights. Supported by Mason but opposed by Madison, Light-Horse Harry Lee, Marshall, Nicholas, Randolph and Bushrod Washington, the resolution failed, 88–80. Mason then voted in the minority as Virginia ratified the constitution on June 25, 1788 by a vote of 89–79. Following the ratification vote, Mason served on a committee chaired by George Wythe, charged with compiling a final list of recommended amendments, and Mason&#x27;s draft was adopted, but for a few editorial changes. Unreconciled to the result, Mason prepared a fiery written argument, but some felt the tone too harsh and Mason agreed not to publish it.

==Final years==
Defeated at Richmond, Mason returned to Gunston Hall, where he devoted himself to family, local affairs and his own health, though still keeping up a vigorous correspondence with political leaders. He resigned from the Fairfax County Court after an act passed by the new Congress required officeholders to take an oath to support the constitution, and in 1790 declined a seat in the Senate which had been left vacant by William Grayson&#x27;s death, stating that his health would not permit him to serve, even if he had no other objection. The seat went to James Monroe, who had supported Mason&#x27;s Anti-Federalist stance, and who had, in 1789, lost to Madison for a seat in the House of Representatives. Judging by his correspondence, Mason softened his stance towards the new federal government, telling Monroe that the constitution &quot;wisely &amp; Properly directs&quot; that ambassadors be confirmed by the Senate. Although Mason predicted that the amendments to be proposed to the states by the First Congress would be &quot;Milk &amp; Water Propositions&quot;, he displayed &quot;much Satisfaction&quot; at what became the Bill of Rights (ratified in 1791) and wrote that if his concerns about the federal courts and other matters were addressed, &quot;I could cheerfully put my Hand &amp; Heart to the new Government&quot;.
Washington, who was in 1789 elected the first president, resented Mason&#x27;s strong stances against the ratification of the constitution, and these differences destroyed their friendship. Although some sources accept that Mason dined at Mount Vernon on November 2, 1788, Peter R. Henriques noted that Washington&#x27;s diary states that Mr. George Mason was the guest, and as Washington, elsewhere in his diary, always referred to his former colleague at Philadelphia as Colonel Mason, the visitor was likely George Mason V, the son. Mason always wrote positively of Washington, and the president said nothing publicly, but in a letter referred to Mason as a &quot; friend&quot; who would not recant his position on the constitution because &quot;pride on the one hand, and want of manly candour on the other, will not I am certain let him acknowledge error in his opinions respecting it [the federal government] though conviction should flash on his mind as strongly as a ray of light&quot;. Rutland suggested that the two men were alike in their intolerance of opponents and suspicion of their motives.

Mason had long battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly dominated the county court, if only because they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse to the center of the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson&#x27;s visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.

Although Mason&#x27;s death attracted little notice, aside from a few mentions in local newspapers, Jefferson mourned &quot;a great loss&quot;. Another future president, Monroe, stated that Mason&#x27;s &quot;patriotic virtues thro[ugh] the revolution will ever be remembered by the citizens of this country&quot;.

==Views on slavery==

Mason routinely spoke out against slavery, even before America&#x27;s independence. In 1773, he wrote that slavery was &quot;that slow Poison, which is daily contaminating the Minds &amp; Morals of our People. Every Gentlemen here is born a petty Tyrant.&quot; In 1774, he advocated ending the international slave trade.

Like nearly all Virginia land owners at the time, Mason owned many slaves. In Fairfax County, only George Washington owned more, and Mason is not known to have freed any, even in his March 1773 will ultimately transcribed into the Fairfax County probate records in October 1792 (the original was then lost). That will divided his slaves among his children (between twenty and three years old when Mason wrote it). Mason would continue trading in land as well as remarry (with a marriage agreement recorded in Prince William County in April 1780), and Virginia legalized manumission in May 1782. The childless Washington, in his will executed shortly before his death, ordered his slaves be freed after his wife&#x27;s death, and Jefferson manumitted a few slaves, mostly of the Hemings family, including his own children by Sally Hemings. According to Broadwater, &quot;In all likelihood, Mason believed, or convinced himself, that he had no options. Mason would have done nothing that might have compromised the financial futures of his nine children.&quot; Peter Wallenstein, in his article about how writers have interpreted Mason, argued that he could have freed some slaves without harming his children&#x27;s future, if he had wanted to.

Mason&#x27;s biographers and interpreters have long differed about how to present his views on slavery-related issues. His descendant Kate Mason Rowland, a charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy published a two-volume biography in 1892. Broadwater noted that she wrote &quot;during the heyday of Jim Crow&quot; and denied that Mason (her ancestor) was &quot;an &quot;abolitionist&quot; in the modern sense of the term&quot;, arguing that Mason &quot;regretted&quot; slavery and was against the slave trade, but wanted slavery protected in the constitution. In 1919, Robert C. Mason published a biography of his prominent ancestor and asserted that George Mason &quot;agreed to free his own slaves and was the first known abolitionist&quot;, refusing to sign the constitution, among other reasons because &quot;as it stood then it did not abolish slavery or make preparation for its gradual extinction&quot;. Rutland, writing in 1961, asserted that in Mason&#x27;s final days, &quot;only the coalition [between New England and the Deep South at the Constitutional Convention] in Philadelphia that had bargained away any hope of eliminating slavery left a residue of disgust.&quot; Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her widely read 1966 account of the Constitutional Convention, &quot;Miracle at Philadelphia&quot;, contended that Mason believed slaves to be citizens and was &quot;a fervent abolitionist before the word was coined&quot;.

Others took a more nuanced view. Pamela C. Copeland and Richard K. MacMaster deemed Mason&#x27;s views similar to other Virginians of his class: &quot;Mason&#x27;s experience with slave labor made him hate slavery but his heavy investment in slave property made it difficult for him to divest himself of a system that he despised&quot;. According to Wallenstein, &quot;whatever his occasional rhetoric, George Mason was—if one must choose—proslavery, not antislavery. He acted in behalf of Virginia slaveholders, not Virginia slaves&quot;. Broadwater noted, &quot;Mason consistently voiced his disapproval of slavery. His 1787 attack on slavery echoes a similar speech to the Virginia Convention of 1776. His conduct was another matter.&quot;

According to Wallenstein, historians and other writers &quot;have had great difficulty coming to grips with Mason in his historical context, and they have jumbled the story in related ways, misleading each other and following each other&#x27;s errors&quot;. Some of this is due to conflation of Mason&#x27;s views on slavery with that of his desire to ban the African slave trade, which he unquestionably opposed and fought against. His record otherwise is mixed: Virginia banned the importation of slaves from abroad in 1778, while Mason was in the House of Delegates. In 1782, after he had returned to Gunston Hall, it enacted legislation that allowed manumission of adult slaves young enough to support themselves (not older than 45). However, a proposal, supported by Mason, to require freed slaves to leave Virginia within a year or be sold at auction, was defeated. Broadwater asserted, &quot;Mason must have shared the fears of Jefferson and countless other whites that whites and free blacks could not live together&quot;.

The contradiction between wanting protection for slave property, while opposing the slave trade, was pointed out by delegates to the Richmond convention such as George Nicholas, a supporter of ratification. Mason stated of slavery, &quot;it is far from being a desirable property. But it will involve us in great difficulties and infelicity to be now deprived of them.&quot;

==Sites and remembrance==

There are sites remembering George Mason in Fairfax County. Gunston Hall, donated to the Commonwealth of Virginia by its last private owner, is now &quot;dedicated to the study of George Mason, his home and garden, and life in 18th-century Virginia&quot;. George Mason University, with its main campus adjacent to the city of Fairfax, was formerly George Mason College of the University of Virginia from 1959 until it received its present name in 1972. A major landmark on the Fairfax campus is a statue of George Mason by Wendy M. Ross, depicted as he presents his first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights.

The George Mason Memorial Bridge, part of the 14th Street Bridge, connects Northern Virginia to Washington, D.C. The George Mason Memorial in West Potomac Park in Washington, also with a statue by Ross, was dedicated on April 9, 2002.

Mason was honored in 1981 by the United States Postal Service with an 18-cent Great Americans series postage stamp. A bas-relief of Mason appears in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives as one of 23 honoring great lawmakers. Mason&#x27;s image is located above and to the right of the Speaker&#x27;s chair; he and Jefferson are the only Americans recognized.

==Legacy and historical view==

According to Miller, &quot;The succession of New World constitutions of which Virginia&#x27;s, with Mason as its chief architect, was the first, declared the source of political authority to be the people ... in addition to making clear what a government was entitled to do, most of them were prefaced by a list of individual rights of the citizens ... rights whose maintenance was government&#x27;s primary reason for being. Mason wrote the first of these lists.&quot; Diane D. Pikcunas, in her article prepared for the bicentennial of the U.S. Bill of Rights, wrote that Mason &quot;made the declaration of rights as his personal crusade&quot;. Tarter deemed Mason &quot;celebrated as a champion of constitutional order and one of the fathers of the Bill of Rights&quot;. Supreme Court associate justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor agreed, &quot;George Mason&#x27;s greatest contribution to present day Constitutional law was his influence on our Bill of Rights&quot;.

Mason&#x27;s legacy extended overseas, doing so even in his lifetime, and though he never visited Europe, his ideals did. Lafayette&#x27;s
&quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot; was written in the early days of the French Revolution under the influence of Jefferson, the U.S. Minister to France. According to historian R.R. Palmer, &quot;there was in fact a remarkable parallel between the French Declaration and the Virginia Declaration of 1776&quot;. Another scholar, Richard Morris, concurred, deeming the resemblance between the two texts &quot;too close to be coincidental&quot;: &quot;the Virginia statesman George Mason might well have instituted an action of plagiarism&quot;.

Donald J. Senese, in the conclusion to the collection of essays on Mason published in 1989, noted that several factors contributed to Mason&#x27;s obscurity in the century after his death. Mason was older than many of those who served in Philadelphia and subsequently came into prominence with the new federal government. Mason died soon after the constitution came into force and displayed no ambition for federal office, declining a seat in the Senate. Mason left no extensive paper trail and, unlike Franklin, who authored an autobiography, left no diary like Washington or John Adams. Washington left papers collected into 100 volumes; for Mason, many of whose documents lost to fire, there were only three that endured. Mason fought on the side that failed, both at Philadelphia and Richmond, leaving him a loser in a history written by winners, even his speeches to the Constitutional Convention descend through the pen of Madison, a supporter of ratification. After the Richmond convention, he was, according to Senese, &quot;a prophet without honor in his own country&quot;.

The increased scrutiny of Mason which has accompanied his rise from obscurity has meant, according to Tarter, that &quot;his role in the creation of some of the most important texts of American liberty is not as clear as it seems&quot;. Rutland suggested that Mason showed only &quot;belated concern over the personal rights of citizens&quot;. Focusing on Mason&#x27;s dissent from the constitution, Miller pointed to the intersectional bargain struck over navigation acts and the slave trade, &quot;Mason lost on both counts, and the double defeat was reflected in his attitude thereafter.&quot; Wallenstein concluded, &quot;the personal and economic interests of Mason&#x27;s home state took precedence over a bill of rights&quot;.

Whatever his motivations, Mason proved a forceful advocate for a bill of rights whose &quot;Objections&quot; helped accomplish his aims. Rutland noted that &quot;from the opening phrase of his &quot;Objections&quot; to the Bill of Rights that James Madison offered in Congress two years later, the line is so direct that we can say that Mason forced Madison&#x27;s hand. Federalist supporters of the Constitution could not overcome the protest caused by Mason&#x27;s phrase &#x27;There is no declaration of rights&#x27;.&quot; O&#x27;Connor wrote that &quot;Mason lost his battle against ratification ... [but] his ideals and political activities have significantly influenced our constitutional jurisprudence.&quot; Wallenstein felt that there is much to be learned from Mason:

<text>John Peters Humphrey (April 30, 1905 – March 14, 1995) was a Canadian legal scholar, jurist, and human rights advocate. He is most famous as the principal author of the first draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

==Childhood, education and academic career==
Humphrey was born to Frank Humphrey and Nellie Peters on April 30, 1905, in Hampton, New Brunswick. His childhood was wracked by tragedy: losing both parents to cancer, and one of his arms in an accident while playing with fire. Humphrey attended a boarding school where he endured teasing from other students; it is claimed that this was influential in building his character and compassion.

John Humphrey applied to Mount Allison University at the age of 15 from the Rothesay Collegiate School and was accepted. He transferred to McGill University and lived with his sister Ruth who was a teacher in Montreal, Quebec. Humphrey graduated from McGill in 1925 where he was awarded a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the School of Commerce, part of the Desautels Faculty of Management. He promptly enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Law at McGill, graduating in 1927 and 1929 respectively. Upon graduation, Humphrey was awarded a fellowship to study in Paris, sailing from Montreal on the RMS &quot;Aurania&quot;. He met fellow passenger Jeanne Godreau while on board and they were married in Paris shortly after arriving.

Humphrey returned to Montreal after the fellowship to practice law for five years before accepting a teaching position as a professor at McGill; he also enrolled in a Master of Law program, specializing in international law. During the 1930s Humphrey was considered a renaissance man with the majority of his interests in education, the arts and humanities.

While teaching at McGill in the early 1940s, Humphrey met Henri Laugier, a refugee from France who was working on behalf of the Free French. In 1943, Laugier moved to Algeria to teach at the University of Algiers and later became the Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations.

While at McGill University, John Peters Humphrey founded the McGill Debating Union, one of the world&#x27;s most successful and prominent debate societies.

== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ==

In 1946, Assistant Secretary-General to the United Nations, Henri Laugier, appointed John Peters Humphrey as the first Director of the United Nations Division of Human Rights, within the United Nations Secretariat.

Humphrey was a principal drafter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. After consulting with the executive group of the Commission, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, Professor Humphrey prepared the first preliminary draft of what was to become the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The draft underwent subsequent revisions (see Drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), after which the final text was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948, proclaimed by Roosevelt as &quot;the international Magna Carta of all humankind.&quot;

== Career in the United Nations ==
Humphrey remained with the UN for 20 years. During this period, he oversaw the implementation of 67 international conventions and the constitutions of dozens of countries. He worked in areas including the freedom of the press, status of women, and racial discrimination. In 1988, on the 40th anniversary of the Declaration, the UN Human Rights award was bestowed on Professor Humphrey.

In 1963, he proposed the idea of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. While the idea was initially received quite positively, it was only after more than thirty years, under Secretary-General Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that the office became a reality.

== Later life ==
Humphrey retired from the UN in 1966 to resume his teaching career at McGill University. He remained active in the promotion of human rights in Canada and internationally for the rest of his life.

He served as a director of the International League for Human Rights; served as a member of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women; a member of the team that launched Amnesty International&#x27;s chapter in Canada; and, with colleagues from McGill University, was instrumental in creating the Canadian Human Rights Foundation, now renamed Equitas -International Centre for Human Rights Education. He took part in a number of international commissions of inquiry, including a mission to the Philippines investigating human rights violations under Ferdinand Marcos and the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932-33 Famine in Ukraine. At the UN, he sought compensation for Korean women forced to act as sex slaves. He also campaigned with the War Amps for reparations for Canadian prisoners of war under Japanese captivity.

In 1974, he spoke in opposition of Bill 22, the Quebec Language Law. He testified on July 19, 1974 that English was also an official language in the province, despite the proposed law. Together with Frank R. Scott, Irwin Cotler and four other McGill professors, he said:

Section 1, which provides that French is &#x27;the official language of the province of Quebec,&#x27; is misleading in that it suggests that English is not also an official language in Quebec, which it is by virtue of Section 133 of the BNA Act and the federal Official Languages Act... No legislation in the National Assembly proclaiming French the sole official language in the province can affect these bilingual areas protected by the BNA Act.

Humphrey&#x27;s wife Jeanne died in 1980. He later married Montreal physician Margaret Kunstler, herself a widow. 

Humphrey died in Montreal on March 14, 1995 at the age of 89.

== Honours and recognition ==

Among his many honours, Professor Humphrey was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1974, &quot;in recognition of his contributions to legal scholarship and his world-wide reputation in the field of human rights&quot;.

In 1985, he was made an Officer of the Ordre nationale du Québec.

The &quot;John Peters Humphrey Model United Nations&quot; is held in his honour every May in Fredericton, New Brunswick..

Since 1988, the McGill University Faculty of Law has held the John P. Humphrey Lectureship in Human Rights, an annual lecture on the role of international law and organizations in the worldwide protection of human rights.

In September 1998, Nelson Mandela unveiled a commemorative plaque to Humphrey at the Human Rights Monument, Ottawa, as part of Canada&#x27;s tribute on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration.

A postage stamp to Humphrey was issued in 1998 by Canada Post, marking the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. It was issued in Montreal, where he graduated in law, practiced, and taught. 

The John Humphrey Freedom Award, presented by the Canadian human rights group Rights &amp; Democracy, is awarded each year to organizations and individuals around the world for exceptional achievement in the promotion of human rights and democratic development.

In June 2008, a memorial to Dr. Humphrey was unveiled in his hometown of Hampton, New Brunswick. The memorial, entitled the CREDO monument was sculpted by Hooper Studios and was commissioned by the Hampton John Peters Humphrey Foundation. It is located just a few hundred yards from his childhood home, consists of a UN-style wooden bench with a young and old Humphrey seated. Several brass doves sit on the end of the bench, which sits beside two tall stone plinths, one of which has several articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights carved into it in English, French and Maliseet. The memorial sits on the front lawn of the Hampton Town Hall, which is housed in the former county court house in the centre of town. 

The wooden sculpture has been repaired since its unveiling, but ongoing deterioration prompted an effort to preserve it in bronze. With the permission of the original artists, the wooden memorial statue was bronzed and the wooden bench was replaced with stone. This project was completed on April 30, 2023.

<text>The University of Strathclyde () is a public research university located in Glasgow, Scotland. Founded in 1796 as the Andersonian Institute, it is Glasgow&#x27;s second-oldest university, having received its royal charter in 1964 as the first technological university in the United Kingdom. Taking its name from the historic Kingdom of Strathclyde, its combined enrollment of 25,000 undergraduate and graduate students ranks it Scotland&#x27;s third-largest university, drawn with its staff from over 100 countries.

The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £432.5 million of which £118.6 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £278.1 million.

==History==
The university was founded in 1796 through the will of John Anderson, professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. He left the majority of his estate to create a second university in Glasgow which would focus on &quot;Useful Learning&quot; – specializing in practical subjects – &quot;for the good of mankind and the improvement of science, a place of useful learning&quot;.

Beginning as the Andersonian Institute, the school changed its name in 1828 to Anderson&#x27;s University, partially fulfilling Anderson&#x27;s vision of having a second university in the city of Glasgow. The name was changed in 1887, to reflect the lack of legal standing for the use of the title of &#x27;university&#x27;. As a result, the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College was formed, becoming the Royal Technical College in 1912, and the Royal College of Science and Technology in 1956 concentrating on science and engineering teaching and research. Undergraduate students could qualify for degrees of the University of Glasgow or the equivalent Associate of the Royal College of Science and Technology (ARCST).

Under Principal Samuel Curran, internationally respected nuclear physicist (and inventor of the scintillation counter), the Royal College gained University Status, receiving its Royal Charter to become The University of Strathclyde in 1964, merging with the Scottish College of Commerce at the same time. Contrary to popular belief, The University of Strathclyde was not created as a result of the Robbins Report – the decision to grant the Royal College university status had been made in 1962 but delayed as a result of Robbins Report. The University of Strathclyde was the UK&#x27;s first technological university, reflecting its history, teaching and research in technological education. Between the granting of the Charter and the late 1970s, the university expanded rapidly in size, in tandem with the ongoing regeneration of the Townhead area of the city where the campus is located. In 1993, the university incorporated Jordanhill College of Education.

The university grew from approximately 4,000 full-time students in 1964 to over 20,000 students by 2003, when it celebrated the 100th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone of the original Royal College building.

In recognition of its founder, and the loss of association with his name, the university named its city centre campus the John Anderson Campus in..

In July 2015, Her Majesty The Queen opened the University of Strathclyde Technology and Innovation Centre (TIC).

==Campus==


The John Anderson Campus is located mostly within the Townhead district, on the north-eastern side of Glasgow city centre, with some buildings located south of this in the Merchant City area. The campus grew initially from the Royal College Building on George Street, which was originally the location of the former Anderson&#x27;s Institution. Work started in 1903 and completed in 1912, it was partially opened in 1910 and at the time was the largest educational building in Europe for technical education. Originally built as the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College Building, it now houses Bioscience, Chemistry, and Electronic and Electrical Engineering. In the mid-1950s, campus expansion began with the construction of the Engineering Block (James Weir Building), Chemistry Block (Thomas Graham Building) and Student&#x27;s Union buildings. Following the granting of the Royal Charter and the Royal College gaining university status in 1964, the campus grew quickly in size. The Corporation of Glasgow had already rezoned what had been a densely populated residential and industrial area for educational use as part of the Townhead &quot;Comprehensive Development Area&quot; (CDA) and by the time of the foundation of the university, slum clearances has already begun In the area. By 1974, thirteen new buildings were erected on what would grow to a 25-acre site.

The new Engineering Block, built in 1956 was the first major expansion of the Royal College, and was extended in 1963 in tandem with the construction of the new Chemistry Block. These buildings would be named the James Weir Building and Thomas Graham Building respectively. The former was refurbished and reopened in 2014 after a serious fire resulted in many rooms being unusable.

University of Strathclyde Students&#x27; Association was founded in 1964 out of the merger of the respective student unions of both the Royal College and the Scottish College of Commerce and was located at 90 John Street, which was constructed by the Royal College in 1959. It remained the home of the Association until August 2021, when it moved into new accommodation within the former Colville Building on Richmond Street.

The Graham Hills Building was originally an office block known as &#x27;Marland House&#x27;, built by the General Post Office and completed in 1959 for the GPO&#x27;s Telephones division and other governmental organisations but was acquired by the university in 1987 from British Telecom and converted for academic use in the early 1990s. It is now the location of the &quot;Strathclyde Wonderwall&quot;, one of the biggest wall murals in the United Kingdom.

The early 1960s also saw the fruition of a collaborative deal between the then Royal College and the Corporation of Glasgow to regenerate the Richmond Street site opposite the main buildings. This led to the construction of the McCance Building and the Livingstone Tower between 1962 and 1964, the latter having originally been designed as a commercial office block, but was instead leased to the university in 1965, and has been used as an academic building ever since.

The Architecture Building, completed in 1967, was designed by Frank Fielden and Associates, Frank Fielden being the Professor of Architecture in the Architecture School at the time. In 2012, Historic Scotland granted Listed Building Status (grade B) to it, along with the Wolfson Centre designed by Morris and Steedman Architects. 2012 also saw the 20th Century Society select the Architecture Building as their &#x27;Building of the Month&#x27; for September due to its cultural significance and enduring appeal. Meanwhile, a new biomedical sciences building was opened in early 2010. It was designed by Shepparrd Robson, and aims to bring the multi-faceted disciplines of the Institute together under one roof. Sited on Cathedral Street in Glasgow, the building is the gateway to the university campus and city centre from the motorway.

In 1973, the university reached an agreement with the publisher William Collins, Sons to purchase its former printing works along Cathedral Street and St James&#x27;s Road. Three buildings from the site were ultimately retained – most notably the giant warehouse which became the Curran Building and Andersonian Library.

The University of Strathclyde Centre for Sports, Health and Wellbeing is a leisure facility undergoing construction situated adjacent to 100 Cathedral Street. Construction began in November 2016 and completed in 2019.

Till 2012, the university operated an education campus in the suburb of Jordanhill, at the site of the previous Jordanhill Teacher Training College which it disposed of and relocated to a new building in the John Anderson Campus. In January 2012, The university&#x27;s Court also endorsed the recommendation of the Estates Steering Group that Strathclyde moves to a single campus by disposing of the entire Jordanhill site and constructing a new building for the Faculty of Education on the John Anderson campus.

===Library and archives===

The Andersonian Library is the principal library of the University of Strathclyde. Established in 1796, it is one of the largest of its type in Scotland. It is situated in the Curran Building, a former warehouse and printing works built by William Collins, Sons in 1960, but purchased by the university in the mid-1970s and converted for academic use between 1978 and 1981. Situated over 5 floors at present, the Andersonian Library has more than 2,000 reader places, 450 computer places and extensive wi-fi zones for laptop use. It has around one million print volumes as well as access to over 540,000 electronic books, 239 databases and over 38,000 e-journals that can be used 24/7 from any suitably enabled computer.

The archives are divided into 3 as follows.

University Archives

===Technology and Innovation Centre===
The University of Strathclyde Technology and Innovation Centre is a centre for technological research. The construction of this centre began in March 2012 and was completed in March 2015. The nine-storey, steel-framed building can accommodate around 1,200 workers from numerous fields, including engineering, researching and project management. It includes open plan space for offices, three lecture theatres and areas for specialist laboratory equipment.

The project secured a £6.7 million funding from the European Regional Development Fund and another £26 million from the Scottish Government. The university itself supplied the other £57 million needed to reach its £89 million budget needed to create the centre.

In addition to the Technology and Innovation Centre, a Industry Engagement Building is located adjacent to the TIC building.

Research carried out in the Technology and Innovation Centre is in the fields of: Advanced Engineering and Manufacturing, Advanced Science and Technology, Bionanotechnology, Business Engagement, Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation (CMAC), Energy, Health Technologies at Strathclyde, Human and Social Aspects of Technology, Photonics and Sensors, and Asset Management.

<text>Liquid water path - in units of g/m2 is a measure of the total amount of liquid water present between two points in the atmosphere. 

LWP is an important quantity in understanding radiative transfer in the atmosphere. It is defined as the integral of liquid water content between two points in the atmosphere. For nadir observations and whole atmospheric column we have 
:formula_1
where is the liquid water mixing ratio and is the density of air (including water loading).

The atmosphere is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium and hydrostatic equation for atmospheric pressure is given by
:formula_2 
which gives
:formula_3
where is gravitational acceleration, is the pressure increment between two layers in the atmosphere and integration is between surface and top of the atmosphere. Liquid water path can also be defined between any two selected points.

The liquid water path can be approximately retrieved from passive and active remote sensing such as microwave radiometer instruments, for example SSM/I.

Typical values of liquid water path in marine stratocumulus can be of the order of 20-80 g/m2.

The liquid water path also contributes to important cloud properties. As the value of the liquid water path increases, so does the albedo of the cloud. This increase in albedo is seen most quickly at the lower end of the liquid water path spectrum, that is, the smaller the amount of total water, the quicker the albedo increases. The radiative absorption of clouds is also dependent on the liquid water path. An increase of liquid water path leads to an increase in absorption. Again, the largest increase is seen with lower levels of liquid water path. These connections are due to the proportionality between the liquid water path and the optical depth of the cloud.

<doc id="224321" wikidata="Q311778" url="?curid=224321" title="John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton">
<text>John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, 13th Marquess of Groppoli, (10 January 1834 – 19 June 1902), better known as Lord Acton, was an English Catholic historian, politician, and writer. A strong advocate for individual liberty, Acton is best known for his timeless observation on the dangers of concentrated authority. In an 1887 letter to an Anglican bishop, he famously wrote, &quot;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,&quot; underscoring his belief that unchecked power poses the greatest threat to human freedom. His works consistently emphasized the importance of limiting governmental and institutional power in favor of individual rights and personal liberty.

==Early life and background==
The only son of Sir Ferdinand Dalberg-Acton, 7th Baronet, and grandson of the Neapolitan admiral and prime minister Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet (who succeeded to the baronetcy and estates held by another branch of the Acton family in Shropshire in 1791), Acton was known as Sir John Dalberg-Acton, 8th Baronet, from 1837 to 1869. His grandfather was part of a younger line of the family that had moved to France and Italy, but after the extinction of the elder branch he became the patriarch.

Acton&#x27;s father, known as Richard, married Marie Louise Pelline, the only daughter of Emmerich Joseph, 1st Duc de Dalberg, a naturalised French noble of ancient German lineage who had entered the French service under Napoleon and represented Louis XVIII at the Congress of Vienna in 1814. After Sir Richard Acton&#x27;s death in 1837, she became the wife of the 2nd Earl Granville (1840). Marie Louise Pelline de Dalberg was heiress of Herrnsheim in Germany. She became the mother of John Dalberg-Acton who was born in Naples.

He was raised as a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Oscott College, under the future-Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, until 1848. He then studied privately at Edinburgh. He was denied entry to the University of Cambridge because he was a Catholic, and subsequently went to Munich where he studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and resided in the house of Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger, the theologian and forerunner of the Old Catholic Church, with whom he became lifelong friends. Döllinger inspired in him a deep love of historical research and a profound conception of its functions as a critical instrument in the study of sociopolitical liberty.

He was a master of the principal foreign languages, and began at an early age to collect a magnificent historical library, which he intended to use to compose a &quot;History of Liberty&quot;. In politics, he was always an ardent Liberal.

==Career==
During his extensive travels, Acton spent much time in the chief intellectual centres of Europe, reading the correspondence of historical personalities. Among his friends were Montalembert, Tocqueville, Fustel de Coulanges, Bluntschli, von Sybel and Ranke. In 1855, he was appointed deputy lieutenant of Shropshire. A year later, he was attached to Lord Granville&#x27;s mission to Moscow as British representative at the coronation of Alexander II of Russia.

===Politics===
In 1859, Acton settled in England, at his country house, Aldenham, in Shropshire. He was returned to the House of Commons that same year as member for the Irish borough of Carlow and became a devoted admirer and adherent of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. However, Acton was not an active MP, and his parliamentary career came to an end after the general election of 1865, when he headed the Liberal ballot for Bridgnorth near his Shropshire home. Acton nearly defeated Conservative leader Henry Whitmore, but Whitmore successfully petitioned for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his seat. After the Reform Act 1867, Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in 1868 but to no avail.

Acton took a great interest in the United States, considering its federal structure an ideal guarantor of individual liberties. During the American Civil War, his sympathies lay entirely with the Confederacy, for their defence of States&#x27; Rights against a centralised government that he believed would inevitably turn tyrannical. His notes to Gladstone on the subject helped sway many in the British government to sympathise with the South. After the South&#x27;s surrender, he wrote to Robert E. Lee that &quot;I mourn for the stake which was lost at Richmond more deeply than I rejoice over that which was saved at Waterloo,&quot; adding that he &quot;deemed that you were fighting battles for our liberty, our progress, and our civilization.&quot; Acton&#x27;s stance on the Confederacy was shared by most English Catholics at the time, both liberal and Ultramontane. The editors of the Ultramontane &quot;Tablet&quot; denounced Abraham Lincoln as a dangerous radical, and John Henry Newman, when asked for his opinion on the matter, stated that slavery was not &quot;intrinsically evil&quot; and that the issue had to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

In 1869, Queen Victoria raised Acton to the peerage as &quot;Baron Acton, of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire&quot;. His elevation came primarily through the intercession of Gladstone. The two were intimate friends and frequent correspondents. Gladstone was particularly concerned to elevate Acton&#x27;s standing as he headed out to Rome to resist the Pope&#x27;s plan to have Papal Infallibility confirmed at the Vatican Council. Both Acton and Gladstone opposed this scheme and it was thought that, if Acton were a British Peer, it would strengthen his position in Rome. Matthew Arnold said: &quot;Gladstone influences all round him but Acton; it is Acton who influences Gladstone.&quot; Acton was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Knight Commander (KCVO) in the 1897 Birthday Honours. He was also a strong supporter of Irish Home Rule.

===Religion and writings===

Meanwhile, Acton became the editor of the Roman Catholic monthly paper, &quot;The Rambler&quot;, in 1859, upon John Henry (later Cardinal) Newman&#x27;s retirement from the editorship. In 1862, he merged this periodical into the &quot;Home and Foreign Review&quot;. Though a sincere Roman Catholic, his spirit as a historian was hostile to ultramontane pretensions, and his independence of thought and liberalism soon brought him into conflict with the church hierarchy. As early as August 1862, Cardinal Wiseman publicly censured the &quot;Review&quot;; and when in 1864, after Döllinger&#x27;s appeal at the Munich Congress for a less hostile attitude towards historical criticism, the pope issued a declaration that the opinions of Catholic writers were subject to the authority of the Roman congregations, Acton felt that there was only one way of reconciling his literary conscience with his ecclesiastical loyalty, and he stopped the publication of his monthly periodical. He continued, however, to contribute articles to the &quot;North British Review&quot;, which, previously a Scottish Free Church organ, had been acquired by friends in sympathy with him, and which for some years (until 1872, when it ceased publication) promoted the interests of a high-class Liberalism in both temporal and ecclesiastical matters. Acton also did a good deal of lecturing on historical subjects.

In the March 1862 &quot;Rambler&quot;, Acton wrote: 
And: &quot;Subjection to a people of a higher capacity for government is of itself no misfortune; and it is to most countries the condition of their political advancement.&quot;

In 1870, along with his mentor Döllinger, Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the doctrine of papal infallibility in the First Vatican Council, travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully. Acton did not become an Old Catholic, and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the last rites on his deathbed. The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic Mandell Creighton, dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:

But if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of Carlylese denunciations and Pharisaism in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like Ravaillac; but if what one hears is true, then Elizabeth asked the gaoler to murder Mary, and William III of England ordered his Scots minister to extirpate a clan. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than Haman, for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.

Thenceforth he steered clear of theological polemics. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm. His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; of January 1878 on &quot;Democracy in Europe;&quot; two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on &quot;The History of Freedom in Antiquity&quot; and &quot;The History of Freedom in Christianity&quot;—these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected &quot;History of Liberty;&quot; and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;, which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, Cannes, and Tegernsee in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Munich; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, and in 1889 Oxford the Doctor of Civil Law; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

In 1874, when Gladstone published his pamphlet on &quot;The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance&quot;, Lord Acton wrote during November and December a series of remarkable letters to &quot;The Times&quot;, illustrating Gladstone&#x27;s main theme by numerous historical examples of papal inconsistency, in a way which must have been bitter enough to the ultramontane party, but ultimately disagreeing with Gladstone&#x27;s conclusion and insisting that the Church itself was better than its premises implied. Acton&#x27;s letters led to another storm in the English Roman Catholic world, but once more it was considered prudent by the Holy See to leave him alone. In spite of his reservations, he regarded &quot;communion with Rome as dearer than life&quot;.

==Personal life==

On 1 August 1865, Acton married Countess Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina von Arco auf Valley (1841–1923), daughter of the Bavarian Count Maximilian von Arco auf Valley, with whom he had six children:

# Mary Elizabeth Anne Dalberg-Acton (1866–1951), married Lt-Col. Edward Bleiddian Herbert and had children.
# Annie Mary Catherine Dalberg-Acton (1868–1917)
# Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton (1870–1924)
# John Dalberg Dalberg-Acton (1872–1873)
# Elizabeth Mary Dalberg-Acton (1874–1881)
# Jeanne Marie Dalberg-Acton (1876–1919)

His nephew was Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley (1897–1945), a German count and political activist, and assassin of socialist Bavarian minister-president Kurt Eisner in 1919.

When his cousin Maria, Duchess of Galliera died in 1888, Acton inherited the dormant title of Marquess of Groppoli.

==Professor at Cambridge==
Acton&#x27;s reputation for learning spread gradually abroad, largely through Gladstone&#x27;s influence. Gladstone found him a valuable political adviser, and in 1892, when the Liberal government came in, Lord Acton was made a lord-in-waiting. Finally, in 1895, on the death of Sir John Seeley, Lord Rosebery appointed him to the Regius Professorship of Modern History at Cambridge. He delivered two courses of lectures on the French Revolution and on Modern History, along with private tutoring. The &quot;Cambridge Modern History&quot;, though he did not live to see it, was planned under his editorship.

==Death and legacy==
After his health began to fail in 1901, Acton died on 19 June 1902 at his wife&#x27;s family home in the spa town of Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany. He was buried in a small communal graveyard by Lake Tegernsee, a grave which today lies unmarked, having lost its headstone in the latter half of the 20th century. He was succeeded in the title by his son, Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton. His 60,000-volume library, with books full of his own annotations, was purchased prior to his death by Andrew Carnegie in secret, in order to secure the library for Acton&#x27;s use during his lifetime. Upon Lord Acton&#x27;s death, it was presented to John Morley, who donated it to the University of Cambridge.
According to Hugh Chisholm, author of the article in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:
The Acton School of Business, established in 2002 in Austin, Texas, was named in his honor.

<text>A microwave radiometer (MWR) is a radiometer that measures energy emitted at one millimeter-to-metre wavelengths (frequencies of 0.3–300 GHz) known as microwaves. Microwave radiometers are very sensitive receivers designed to measure thermally-emitted electromagnetic radiation. They are usually equipped with multiple receiving channels to derive the characteristic emission spectrum of planetary atmospheres, surfaces or extraterrestrial objects. Microwave radiometers are utilized in a variety of environmental and engineering applications, including remote sensing, weather forecasting, climate monitoring, radio astronomy and radio propagation studies.

Using the microwave spectral range between 1 and 300 GHz provides complementary information to the visible and infrared spectral range. Most importantly, the atmosphere and also vegetation is semi-transparent in the microwave spectral range. This means components like dry gases, water vapor, or hydrometeors interact with microwave radiation but overall even the cloudy atmosphere is not completely opaque in this frequency range.

For weather and climate monitoring, microwave radiometers are operated from space as well as from the ground. As remote sensing instruments, they are designed to operate continuously and autonomously often in combination with other atmospheric remote sensors like for example cloud radars and lidars. They allow the derivation of important meteorological quantities such as vertical temperature and humidity profiles, columnar water vapor quantity, and columnar liquid water path with a high temporal resolution on the order of minutes to seconds under nearly all weather conditions. Microwave radiometers are also used for remote sensing of Earth&#x27;s ocean and land surfaces, to derive ocean temperature and wind speed, ice characteristics, and soil and vegetation properties.

==History==

First developments of microwave radiometer were dedicated to the measurement of radiation of extraterrestrial origin in the 1930s and 1940s. The most common form of microwave radiometer was introduced by Robert Dicke in 1946 in the Radiation Laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology to better determine the temperature of the microwave background radiation. This first radiometer worked at a wavelength 1.25 cm and was operated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dicke also first discovered weak atmospheric microwave absorption using three different radiometers (at wavelengths of 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 cm).

Soon after satellites were first used for observing the atmosphere, microwave radiometers became part of their instrumentation. In 1962 the Mariner-2 mission was launched by NASA in to investigate the surface of Venus including a radiometer for water vapor and temperature observations. In following years a wide variety of microwave radiometers were tested on satellites. The launch of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer in 1978 became an important milestone in the history of radiometry. It was the first time a conically scanning radiometer was used in space; it was launched into space on board the NASA Nimbus satellite. The launch of this mission gave the opportunity to image the Earth at a constant angle of incidence that is important as surface emissivity is angle dependent. In the beginning of 1980, new multi-frequency, dual-polarization radiometric instruments were developed. Two spacecraft were launched which carried instruments of this type: Nimbus-7 and Seasat. The Nimbus-7 mission results allowed to globally monitor the state of ocean surface as well as surface covered by snow and glaciers. Today, microwave instruments like the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager / Sounder (SSMIS) are widely used on different satellites.

Ground-based radiometers for the determination of temperature profiles were first explored in the 1960s and have since improved in terms of reduced noise and the ability to run unattended 24/7 within worldwide observational networks. Review articles, and a detailed online handbook are available.

==Principle of operation==
Solids, liquids (e.g. the Earth&#x27;s surface, ocean, sea ice, snow, vegetation) but also gases emit and absorb microwave radiation. Traditionally, the amount of radiation a microwave radiometer receives is expressed as the equivalent blackbody temperature also called brightness temperature. In the microwave range several atmospheric gases exhibit rotational lines. They provide specific absorption features shown at a figure on the right which allow to derive information about their abundance and vertical structure. Examples for such absorption features are the oxygen absorption complex (caused by magnetic dipole transitions) around 60 GHz which is used to derive temperature profiles or the water vapor absorption line around 22.235 GHz (dipole rotational transition) which is used to observe the vertical profile of humidity. Other significant absorption lines are found at 118.75 GHz (oxygen absorption) and at 183.31 GHz (water vapor absorption, used for water vapor profiling under dry conditions or from satellites). Weak absorption features due to ozone are also used for stratospheric ozone density and temperature profiling.

Besides the distinct absorption features of molecular transition lines, there are also non-resonant contributions by hydrometeors (liquid drops and frozen particles). Liquid water emission increases with frequency, hence, measuring at two frequencies, typically one close to the water absorption line (22.235 GHz) and one in the nearby window region (typically 31 GHz) dominated by liquid absorption provides information on both the columnar amount of water vapor and the columnar amount of liquid water separately (two-channel radiometer). The so-called „water vapor continuum&quot; arises from the contribution of far away water vapor lines.

Larger rain drops as well as larger frozen hydrometeors (snow, graupel, hail) also scatter microwave radiation especially at higher frequencies (&gt;90 GHz). These scattering effects can be used to distinguish between rain and cloud water content exploiting polarized measurements but also to constrain the columnar amount of snow and ice particles from space and from the ground.

==Design==
A microwave radiometer consists of an antenna system, microwave radio-frequency components (front-end) and a back-end for signal processing at intermediate frequencies. 

The key element is the Dicke switch, which alternately switches between the antenna and a cryogenic load at a known temperature. A calculation from the change in noise level, gives the sky temperature.

The atmospheric signal is very weak and the signal needs to be amplified by around 80 dB. Therefore, heterodyne techniques are often used to convert the signal down to lower frequencies that allow the use of commercial amplifiers and signal processing. Increasingly low noise amplifiers are becoming available at higher frequencies, i.e. up to 100 GHz, making heterodyne techniques obsolete. Thermal stabilization is highly important to avoid receiver drifts.

Usually ground-based radiometers are also equipped with environmental sensors (rain, temperature, humidity) and GPS receivers (time and location reference). The antenna itself often measures through a window made of foam which is transparent in the microwave spectrum to keep the antenna clean of dust, liquid water and ice. Often, also a heated blower system is attached the radiometer which helps to keep the window free of liquid drops or dew (strong emitters in the MW) but also free of ice and snow.

As seen from the figure above, after the radiofrequency signal is received at the antenna it is downconverted to the intermediate frequency with the help of a stable local oscillator signal. After amplification with a Low Noise Amplifier and band pass filtering the signal can be detected in full power mode, by splitting or splitting it into multiple frequency bands with a spectrometer. For high-frequency calibrations a Dicke switch is used here.

== Calibration ==
The calibration of microwave radiometer sets the basis for accurate measured brightness temperatures and therefore, for accurate retrieved atmospheric parameters as temperature profiles, integrated water vapor and liquid water path. The simplest version of a calibration is a so-called &quot;hot-cold&quot; calibration using two reference blackbodies at known, but different, &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; temperatures, i.e. assuming a linear relation between input power and output voltage of the detector. Knowing the physical temperatures of the references, their brightness temperatures can be calculated and directly related to detected voltages of the radiometer, hence, the linear relationship between brightness temperatures and voltages can be obtained.

The temperatures of the calibration targets should be chosen such that they span the full measurement range. Ground-based radiometers usually use an ambient temperature target as &quot;hot&quot; reference. As a cold target one can use either a liquid nitrogen cooled blackbody (77 K) or a zenith clear sky TB that was obtained indirectly from radiative transfer theory. Satellites use a heated target as &quot;hot&quot; reference and the cosmic background radiation as &quot;cold&quot; reference. To increase the accuracy and stability of MWR calibrations further calibration targets, such as internal noise sources, or Dicke switches can be used.

== Retrieval of temperature and water vapor profiles ==
The retrieval of physical quantities using microwave radiometry (e.g. temperature or water vapor profiles) is not straightforward and comprehensive retrieval algorithms (using inversion techniques like optimal estimation approach) have been developed.

Temperature profiles are obtained by measuring along the oxygen absorption complex at 60 GHz. The emission at any altitude is proportional to the temperature and density of oxygen. As oxygen is homogeneously distributed within the atmosphere and around the globe, the brightness temperature signals can be used to derive the temperature profile. Signals at the center of the absorption complex are dominated by the atmosphere closest to the radiometer (when ground-based). Moving into the window region, the signal is a superposition from close and far regions of the atmosphere. The combination of several channels contains therefore information about the vertical temperature distribution. A similar approach is used to derive vertical profiles of water vapor utilizing its absorption line at 22.235 GHz and also around the 183.31 GHz absorption line.

==Satellite instrumentation==

Microwave instruments are flown on several polar orbiting satellites for Earth observation and operational meteorology as well as part of extraterrestrial missions. 

One distinguishes between &quot;imaging&quot; instruments that
are used with conical scanning for remote sensing of the Earth surface, e.g. AMSR, SSMI, WINDSAT, and &quot;sounding&quot; instruments that are operated in cross-track mode, e.g. ATMS/MHS. The first type uses lower frequencies (1–100 GHz) in atmospheric windows to observe sea-surface salinity, soil moisture, sea-surface temperature, wind speed over ocean, precipitation and snow. Other than optical earth observation sensors, passive microwave can be used do determine the snow water equivalent (liquit water content of snow) by comparing various frequencies. The second type is used to measure along absorption lines to retrieve temperature and humidity profile. Furthermore, limb sounders, e.g., MLS, are used to retrieve trace gas profiles in the upper atmosphere.

Other examples of microwave radiometers on meteorological satellites include the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer, WindSat, Microwave Sounding Unit and Microwave Humidity Sounder. The Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis is an interferometer/imaging radiometer capable of resolving soil moisture and salinity over small regions of surface.

==Spaceprobe instruments==
By the 2010s four microwave radiometers have been flown on interplanetary spacecraft. The first was Mariner 2, which used a microwave instrument to determine the high surface temperature of Venus was coming from the surface not higher up in the atmosphere. There are/were also radiometers on the Juno Jupiter probe, the Rosetta comet probe, and Cassini-Huygens.

The Juno probe, launched in 2011, is characterizing the atmosphere of Jupiter using a microwave radiometer suite. The Microwave Radiometer (MWR) instrument on Juno has several antennas observing in several different microwave wavelengths to penetrate the top cloud layer of the planet, and detect features, temperatures, and chemical abundances there.

== Ground-based networks ==

MWRnet is a network established in 2009 of scientists working with ground-based microwave radiometers. MWRnet aims to facilitate the exchange of information in the MWR user community fostering the participation to coordinated international projects. In the long run, MWRnet’s mission aims at setting up operational software, quality control procedures, data formats, etc. similar to other successful networks such as EARLINET, AERONET, CWINDE.

<text>A ceilometer is a device that uses a laser or other light source to determine the height of a cloud ceiling or cloud base. Ceilometers can also be used to measure the aerosol concentration within the atmosphere. A ceilometer that uses laser light is a type of atmospheric lidar (light detection and ranging) instrument.

==Optical drum ceilometer==
An optical drum ceilometer uses triangulation to determine the height of a spot of light projected onto the base of the cloud. It consists essentially of a rotating projector, a detector, and a recorder. The projector emits an intense beam of light above into the sky at an angle that varies with the rotation. The detector, which is located at a fixed distance from the projector, uses a photodetector pointing vertically. When it detects the projected light return from the cloud base, the instrument notes the angle and the calculation gives the height of clouds.

==Laser ceilometer==
A laser ceilometer consists of a vertically pointing laser and a receiver in the same location. A laser pulse with a duration on the order of nanoseconds is sent through the atmosphere. As the beam travels through the atmosphere, tiny fractions of the light are scattered by aerosols. Generally, the size of the particles in question are similar in size to the wavelength of the laser. This situation leads to Mie scattering. A small component of this scattered light is directed back to the lidar receiver. The timing of the received signal can be transformed into a spatial range, &quot;z&quot;, by using the speed of light. That is,

:formula_1

where c is the light speed in the air.

In this way, each pulse of laser light results in a vertical profile of aerosol concentration within the atmosphere. Generally, many individual profiles will be averaged together in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and average profiles are reported on a time scale of seconds. The presence of clouds or water droplets leads to a very strong return signal compared to background levels, which allows for cloud heights to be easily identified.

Since the instrument will note any returns, it is possible to locate any faint layer where it occurs, additionally to the cloud&#x27;s base, by looking at the whole pattern of returned energy. Furthermore, the rate at which diffusion happens can be noted by the diminishing part returned to the ceilometer in clear air, giving the coefficient of extinction of the light signal. Using these data could give the vertical visibility and the possible concentration of air pollutants. This has been developed in research and could be applied for operational purpose.

In New Zealand, MetService operates a network of laser ceilometers for cloud base measurements at commercial airports. These sensors are also used to map volcanic ash clouds to allow commercial air traffic to avoid damage caused by ash. The movement of volcanic ash has also been tracked from areas such as Iceland.

Examination of the behavior of ceilometers under various cloud-cover conditions has led to the improvement of algorithms to avoid false readings. Accuracy of measurement can be impacted by the limited vertical range and areal extent of a ceilometer&#x27;s area of observation.

A common use of ceilometers is to monitor the cloud ceiling for airports.
A study group from Montreal, Canada in 2013 recommended that ceilometers should be installed &quot;close to the landing threshold&quot; for aerodromes with precision approach runways, but also considered their location &quot;at the middle marker or at an equivalent distance&quot; to be acceptable.

== Hazards ==
Ceilometers that use visible light can sometimes be fatal to birds, as the animals become disoriented by the light beams and suffer exhaustion and collisions with other birds and structures. In the worst recorded ceilometer non-laser light beam incident, approximately 50,000 birds from 53 different species died at Warner Robins Air Force Base in the United States during one night in 1954.

Laser ceilometers use invisible lasers to observe the cloud base. Using optical instruments such as binoculars near ceilometers is not recommended, because lenses in instruments could concentrate the beam and damage one&#x27;s eyes.

<doc id="224330" wikidata="Q560086" url="?curid=224330" title="Albert Namatjira">
<text>Albert Namatjira (; born Elea Namatjira; 28 July 1902 – 8 August 1959) was an Arrernte painter from the MacDonnell Ranges in Central Australia, widely considered one of the most notable Australian artists. As a pioneer of contemporary Indigenous Australian art, he was arguably one of the most famous Indigenous Australians of his generation. He was the first Aboriginal artist to receive popularity from a wide Australian audience.

A member of the Western Arrernte people, Namatjira was born and raised at the remote Hermannsburg Lutheran Mission, 126 km west-southwest from Alice Springs. He showed interest in art from an early age but it was not until 1934 (aged 32) and under the guidance of Rex Battarbee that he began to paint seriously. Namatjira&#x27;s richly detailed, Western art-influenced watercolours of the outback departed significantly from the abstract designs and symbols of traditional Aboriginal art, and inspired the Hermannsburg School of painting. He became a household name in Australia and reproductions of his works hung in many homes throughout the nation.

In 1956, a portrait of Namatjira by William Dargie became the first of an Aboriginal person to win the Archibald Prize. Namatjira was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Coronation Medal in 1953, and was honoured with an Australian postage stamp in 1968.

Namatjira was the first recorded Northern Territory Aboriginal person to be freed from restrictions that made Aboriginal people wards of the state when he was granted full rights of citizenship in 1957. This gave him the right to vote in national, state and territory elections, gave him freedom of movement and freed him from restrictions on buying alcohol; but, in the Northern Territory, he still had limited land rights. However, Namatjira remained poorly treated by the government; he was sentenced to prison after leaving a bottle of rum on the back seat of his car, which was likely taken and consumed by a man who had then drunkenly beaten and killed his own wife. Public and international outcry intervened in the liability ruling and Namatjira instead served less than two months in a native reserve in Papunya. He continued to live in Papunya with his wife, until he died of heart disease in an Alice Springs hospital in 1959.

Described as a &quot;monumental figure&quot; within Australian art, Namatjira is considered one of the most talented Arrernte artists to have lived. As one of the foremost painters of the Hermannsburg movement, he blended indigenous landscapes and Western-style painting techniques to &quot;bring central Australia to life, for thousands who had never seen it for themselves.&quot; His legacy lives on through international critical acclaim, the naming of his homeland&#x27;s electorate after him, and his artistically inclined descendants. They form the artistic and memorial collective the Namatjira project, which includes his Ramsay Prize and Archibald Prize-winning great-grandson Vincent Namatjira.

==Early life==
He was born at Hermannsburg Mission, Ntaria, in Alice Springs in 1902, the son of Namatjira and Ljukuta. They were Western Arrernte people.

Namatjira was raised on the Hermannsburg Mission and baptised after his parents&#x27; adoption of Christianity. He was born as Elea, but once baptised, they changed his name to Albert. As a child, he sketched what he saw around him. After a western-style upbringing on the mission, including attending the school and living in a dormitory, separated from his parents, at the age of 13 Namatjira returned to the bush for initiation and was exposed to traditional culture and initiated as a member of the Arrernte community (in which he was to eventually become an elder).

When he was 18 years old, he left the mission and married his wife Ilkalita, a Kukatja woman, who was christened Rubina upon their return to Hermannsburg. They had five sons and three daughters.

His wife, like his father&#x27;s wife, was from the wrong skin group and he violated the law of his people by marrying outside the classificatory kinship system. In 1928 he was ostracised for several years in which he worked as a camel driver and saw much of Central Australia, which he was later to depict in his paintings. He also worked as a blacksmith, carpenter and stockman, at the mission and at the surrounding cattle stations.

He was a cousin of Aboriginal country music star Gus Williams, and is credited with bringing music into Williams&#x27; life.

==Career==

Namatjira was introduced to western-style painting through a charity art exhibition in 1933, which raised the money to bring fresh water to his hometown of Hermannsburg. The exhibition was run by Violet Teague, whom Namatjira admired enough to name his daughter after, and her sister Una.

In 1934, Namatjira met Rex Battarbee and John Gardner, who had an exhibition at his mission. Battarbee returned to the area in the winter of 1936 to paint the landscape, and Namatjira, expressing an interest in learning to paint, acted as his cameleer and guide to show him local scenic areas.

Namatjira started painting in a unique style. His landscapes normally highlighted both the rugged geological features of the land in the background, and the distinctive Australian flora in the foreground with very old, stately and majestic white gum trees surrounded by twisted scrub. His work had a high quality of illumination showing the gashes of the land and the twists in the trees. His colours were similar to the ochres that his ancestors had used to depict the same landscape, but his style was appreciated by Europeans because it met the aesthetics of western art.

In his early career, Namatjira&#x27;s work included tjuringa (sacred object) designs, biblical themes and figurative subjects, and he also carved and painted various artefacts.

In 1937 Friedrich Albrecht, superintendent of Hermannsburg, took ten of Namatjira&#x27;s watercolours with him to a Lutheran conference at Nuriootpa, South Australia, and Battarbee put three of his paintings in an exhibition with the Royal South Australian Society of Arts in Adelaide. In 1938, Namatjira held his first solo exhibition in Melbourne.

He became the first prominent Aboriginal artist to work in a contemporary western style, and thus regarded as an example of assimilation. In 1944 he was included in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Australia&quot;.

Subsequent exhibitions in Sydney and Adelaide also sold out. His work garnered wide acclaim, both in Australia and in other countries. Queen Elizabeth II became one of his more notable fans and he was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Coronation Medal in 1953 and met her in Canberra in 1954. He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales in 1955.

Not only did his own art become widely recognised, but a painting of him by William Dargie won the Archibald Prize in 1956, the first painting of an Aboriginal person to win the prize.

==Artworks, style and critical reception==
Namatjira&#x27;s artworks were colourful and varied depictions of the Australian landscape. One of his first landscapes from 1936, &quot;Central Australian Landscape&quot;, shows a land of rolling green hills. Another early work, &quot;Ajantzi Waterhole&quot; (1937), shows a close up view of a small waterhole, with Namatjira capturing the reflection in the water. The landscape becomes one of contrasting colours, a device that is often used by Western painters, with red hills and green trees in &quot;Red Bluff&quot; (1938). &quot;Central Australian Gorge&quot; (1940) shows detailed rendering of rocks and reflections in the water. In &quot;Flowering Shrubs&quot; Namatjira contrasts the blossoming flowers in the foreground with the more barren desert and cliffs in the background. Namatjira&#x27;s love of trees was often described so that his paintings of trees were more portraits than landscapes, which is shown in the portrait of the often depicted ghost gum in &quot;Ghost Gum Glen Helen&quot; (–49).

His unique style of painting was denounced soon after his death by some critics as being a product of his assimilation into western culture, rather than his own connection to his subject matter or his natural style. This view has, however, been largely abandoned.

Although Namatjira&#x27;s paintings appear similar to conventional European landscapes, his work was imbued with his feeling for country and sacred sites. He used repetition, intricate patterns and high horizons to blend the styles of the two worlds he lived in.

The Art Gallery of New South Wales website quotes George Alexander, coordinator of Contemporary Art Programmes:
In 2022, Namatjira&#x27;s work enjoyed a surge in popularity that exceeded the general increased interest in Australian art at this time. &quot;Glen Helen Gorge&quot; sold for more than in Melbourne, and in July &quot;The Granseur – Mount Sonda&quot; fetched in Adelaide. The latter was a record price, achieving nearly more than had been expected.

==Later life ==

Due to his wealth, Namatjira soon found himself the subject of humbugging, a ritualised form of begging. Arrernte are expected to share everything they own, and as Namatjira&#x27;s income grew, so did his extended family. At one time he was singlehandedly providing for over 600 people with financial support. To ease the burden on his strained resources, Namatjira sought to lease a cattle station to benefit his extended family. Originally granted, the lease was subsequently rejected because the land was part of a returned servicemen&#x27;s ballot, and also because he had no ancestral claim on the property. He then tried to build a house in Alice Springs, but was cheated in his land dealings. The land he was sold was on a flood plain and was unsuitable for building. The Minister for Territories, Paul Hasluck, offered him free land in a reserve on the outskirts of Alice Springs, but this was rejected, and Namatjira and his family took up residence in a squalid shanty at Morris Soak, a dry creek bed some distance from Alice Springs which is now the location of one of the town camps. Despite the fact that he was held as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest artists, Namatjira was living in poverty. His plight became a media &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, resulting in a wave of public outrage.

In 1957 the government exempted Namatjira and his wife from the restrictive legislation that applied to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.

Namatjira was encouraged to apply for full rights of citizenship at 55 years of age, allowing him to vote, own land, build a house and buy alcohol unlike other Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. He was then exempt from classification as an &#x27;Aboriginal&#x27; for the purposes of the &quot;Welfare Ordinance 1953&quot;. This did not mean that he was legally &quot;not&quot; an Aboriginal, as some sources mistakenly suggest. However, his adult children and other relatives remained as &quot;wards&quot; under the &quot;Welfare Ordinance 1953&quot;. Although Albert and Rubina were legally allowed to drink alcohol, his Aboriginal family and friends were not. This artificial social divide and the Arrernte culture that expected him to share everything he owned brought Namatjira into conflict with the law.

When an Aboriginal woman, Fay Iowa, was killed at Morris Soak, Namatjira was held responsible by stipendiary magistrate, Jim Lemaire, for bringing alcohol into the camp. He was reprimanded at the coronial inquest. In the Northern Territory at that time, it was against the law to supply alcohol to an Aboriginal person. Namatjira was charged with leaving a bottle of rum in a place, i.e. on a car seat, where a clan brother and fellow Hermannsburg artist Henoch Raberaba, could get access to it. Convicted for an offence under the &quot;Welfare Ordinance 1953&quot;, for supplying an Aboriginal (a &quot;ward&quot;) with liquor, he was sentenced to six months in prison. Namatjira appealed against the conviction to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory (with his defence supported by the Council for Aboriginal Rights in Victoria). The Supreme Court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence from six to three months. The High Court of Australia refused an application to appeal. There was widespread sympathy for Namatjira and negative publicity about the operation of the Ordinance across Australia and abroad. After the public uproar, the Minister for Territories, Paul Hasluck, intervened and the sentence was served at Papunya Native Reserve. He was released after only serving two months due to medical and humanitarian reasons.
===Last years and Death===
Despondent after his incarceration, Namatjira continued to live with Rubina in a cottage at Papunya, where he suffered a heart attack. There is evidence that Albert believed that he had the bone pointed at him by a member of Fay Iowa&#x27;s family (this idea of being &quot;sung&quot; to death was also held by Frank Clune, a popular travel writer, Aboriginal activist and organiser of Albert&#x27;s whirlwind 1956 trip). After being transferred to Alice Springs hospital, Namatjira astonished his mentor Rex Battarbee by presenting him with three landscapes, with a promise of more to come; a promise unrealised. Namatjira died soon after of heart disease complicated by pneumonia on 8 August 1959 in Alice Springs.

==Legacy==
===Work===
At the time of his death Namatjira had painted a total of around 2,000 paintings. He is hailed today as one of the greatest Australian artists and a pioneer for Aboriginal rights. Namatjira&#x27;s work is on public display in some of Australia&#x27;s major art galleries. The Art Gallery of New South Wales now displays a number of Namatjira&#x27;s work, although Hal Missingham, then Director of the gallery, initially rejected his work, saying: &quot;We&#x27;ll consider his work when it comes up to scratch&quot;.

Two years before his death, part of Namatjira&#x27;s copyright was sold to a company in exchange for royalties. After his death, Albert Namatjira&#x27;s copyright was sold by the public trustee in 1983 for , despite Namatjira&#x27;s will leaving his copyright to his widow and children. The copyright was returned to the family&#x27;s Albert Namatjira Trust in an October 2017 deal enabled by a donation by philanthropist Dick Smith, in the name of art dealer John Brackenreg, who was seen as having acquired the rights to Namatjira&#x27;s art in 1957 in an act of exploitation.

===Official===
Namatjira was honoured on postage stamps issued by Australia Post in 1968, again in 1993 with examples of his work, and in the Namatjira Centenary stamp series in 2002.

The Northern Territory electoral division of Namatjira, which surrounds Alice Springs, was renamed in 2012 from MacDonnell, in honour of Namatjira.

State Route 2, west of Alice Springs, is named Namatjira Drive after Namatjira.

In January 2013, two gum trees that featured prominently in Namatjira&#x27;s watercolours were destroyed in an arson attack, while they were in the process of being heritage-listed, in an &quot;appalling and a tragic act of cultural vandalism&quot;. In 2015, the Twin Gums site was again nominated for heritage listing.

===In the arts===
A number of biographical films have been made about Namatjira (at least three before his death), including the 1947 documentary &quot;Namatjira the Painter&quot;.

Namatjira has been the subject of numerous songs. Country star Slim Dusty was the first artist to record a tribute song, &quot;Namatjira&quot;, in the 1960s, and Rick and Thel Carey followed up with their tribute &quot;The Stairs That Namatjira Climbed&quot; in 1963. Other tributes include John Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Raining on the Rock&quot; from his 1986 album &quot;Mallee Boy&quot; and &quot;The Camel Boy&quot; from &quot;Chandelier of Stars&quot; (2005); &quot;Albert Namatjira&quot; by the Australian band Not Drowning, Waving, featured on their 1993 album, &quot;Circus&quot;, and Midnight Oil&#x27;s song &quot;Truganini&quot; of the same year; the famous patriotic song &quot;I Am Australian&quot;; Archie Roach&#x27;s song, &quot;Native Born&quot;; and the reconciliation song, &quot;Namatjira&quot;, written by Geoff Drummond and included on the politically activist album, &quot;The Chess Set&quot; released by Pat Drummond in 2004.

The Namatjira Project was a community cultural development project launched in 2009 that included an award-winning theatre production by Big hART focusing on Namatjira&#x27;s life and work.

On 28 July 2017, Google commemorated Namatjira&#x27;s 115th birthday with a featured Doodle for Australian users, acknowledging his substantial contributions to the art and culture of Australia.

===Descendants===
A number of Albert Namatjira&#x27;s descendants paint at the &quot;Iltja Ntjarra - Many Hands&quot; art centre in Alice Springs.

Vincent Namatjira, Albert Namatjira&#x27;s great-grandson, is a well-known artist in his own right, winning the Ramsay Art Prize in 2019. Vincent&#x27;s 2014 series, &quot;Albert&#x27;s Story&quot;, reflects on Albert Namatjira&#x27;s life and legacy. About the series, Vincent has stated: &quot;I hope my grandfather would be quite proud, maybe smiling down on me; because I won&#x27;t let him go. I just keep carrying him on, his name and our families&#x27; stories.&quot; The series comprises 13 artworks, telling the story of Albert&#x27;s life. Vincent&#x27;s work was also shortlisted for the Archibald Prize in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and won the prize in 2020. Vincent&#x27;s 2021 book about his great-grandfather, featuring artworks from &quot;Albert&#x27;s Story&quot;, was shortlisted for a 2022 Australian Book Industry Award in the &quot;Small Publishers&#x27; Children&#x27;s Book of the Year&quot; category.

<doc id="224336" wikidata="Q1781211" url="?curid=224336" title="Cloud base">
<text>A cloud base (or the base of the cloud) is the lowest altitude of the visible portion of a cloud. It is traditionally expressed either in metres or feet above mean sea level or above a planetary surface, or as the pressure level corresponding to this altitude in hectopascals (hPa, equivalent to the millibar).

==Measurement==

The height of the cloud base can be measured using a ceilometer. This device reflects a beam of light off the cloud base and then calculates its distance using either triangulation or travel time.

Alternatively, the cloud base can be estimated from surface measurements of air temperature and humidity by calculating the lifted condensation level. One method for doing this, used by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and often named after Tom Bradbury, is as follows:

#Find the difference between the surface temperature and the dew point. This value is known as the &quot;spread&quot;.
#Divide the spread by 4.4 (if temperatures are in °F) or 2.5 (if temperatures are in °C), then multiply by 1000. This will give the altitude of the cloud base in feet above ground level. Put in a simpler way, 400 feet for every 1°C dew point spread. For metric divide the spread in °C by 8 and multiply by 1000 and get the cloud base in meters.
#Add the results from step (2) to the field elevation to obtain the altitude of the cloud base above mean sea level.

==Weather and climate relevance==
Rain clouds and snow clouds are clouds that have their bases below 2,000 meters above the ground.

In well-defined air masses, many (or even most) clouds may have a similar cloud base because this variable is largely controlled by the thermodynamic properties of that air mass, which are relatively homogeneous on a large spatial scale. This is not the case for the cloud tops, which can vary widely from cloud to cloud, as the depth of the cloud is determined by the strength of local convection.

Clouds greatly affect the transfer of radiation in the atmosphere. In the thermal spectral domain, water is a strong absorber (and thus emitter, according to Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation); hence clouds exchange thermal radiation between their bases and the underlying planetary surface (land or ocean) by absorbing and re-emitting this infrared radiation at the prevailing temperature – the lower the cloud base, the warmer the cloud particles and the higher the rate of emission. For a synthetic discussion of the impact of clouds (and in particular the role of cloud bases) on climate systems, see the IPCC Third Assessment Report, in particular chapter 7.2.

Cloud base is an important meteorological variable for aviation safety, as it determines whether pilots may use visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules for take-off and landing.

<doc id="224348" wikidata="Q867782" url="?curid=224348" title="Funan">
<text>Funan (; , ; , Chữ Hán: ; ) was the name given by Chinese cartographers, geographers and writers to an ancient Indianized state—or, rather a loose network of states &quot;(Mandala)&quot;—located in Mainland Southeast Asia covering parts of present-day Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam that existed from the first to sixth century CE. The name is found in Chinese historical texts describing the kingdom, and the most extensive descriptions a name the people of Funan gave to their polity. Some scholars argued that ancient Chinese scholars has found the records from Yuán Shǐ, the history records of Yuan Dynasty. &quot;Syam Kok and Lo Hu Kok, formerly the Kingdom of Funan, were located to the west of Linyi Kok (Champa Kingdom in central Vietnam). The maritime distance was from the capital of Linyi Kok to the capital of Funan Kok. They are separated by about 3,000 li.&quot;

Like the name of the kingdom, the ethno-linguistic nature of the people is the subject of much discussion among specialists. The leading hypotheses are that the Funanese were mostly Mon–Khmer, or that they were mostly Austronesian, or that they constituted a multi-ethnic society. The available evidence is inconclusive on this issue. Michael Vickery has said that, even though identification of the language of Funan is not possible, the evidence suggests that the population was Khmer. However, several studies demonstrates that inhabitants of Funan probably spoke Malayo-Polynesian languages, as in neighboring Champa. The results of archaeology at Oc Eo have demonstrated &quot;no true discontinuity between Oc Eo and pre-Angkorian levels&quot;, indicating ancient Mon-he region may have gone as far back as the 4th century BCE. Though regarded by Chinese authors as a single unified polity, some modern scholars suspect that Funan may have been a collection of city-states that sometimes were at war with one another and at other times constituted a political unity. From archaeological evidence, which includes Roman, Chinese, and Indian goods excavated at the ancient mercantile centre of Óc Eo in southern Vietnam, it is known that Funan must have been a powerful trading state. Excavations at Angkor Borei in southern Cambodia have likewise delivered evidence of an important settlement. Since Óc Eo was linked to a port on the coast and to Angkor Borei by a system of canals, it is possible that all of these locations together constituted the heartland of Funan.

==Etymology==
Some scholars have advanced speculative proposal regarding the origin and meaning of the word &quot;Funan&quot;. It is often said that the name &quot;Funan&quot; (Middle Chinese pronunciation of : /bju nậm/, Later Han pronunciation: /buɑ nəm/) represents a transcription from some local language into Chinese. For example, French scholar Georges Coedès advanced the theory that in using the word &quot;Funan&quot;, ancient Chinese scholars were transcribing a word related to the Khmer word &quot;bnaṃ&quot; or &quot;vnaṃ&quot; (modern: &quot;phnoṃ&quot;, meaning &quot;mountain&quot;).

However, the epigraphist Claude Jacques pointed out that this explanation was based on a mistranslation of the Sanskrit word &quot;parvatabùpála&quot; in the ancient inscriptions as equivalent to the Khmer word &quot;bnaṃ&quot; and a mis-identification of the King Bhavavarman I mentioned in them as the conqueror of Funan. It has also been observed that in Chinese the character (, ) is frequently used in geographical terms to mean &quot;South&quot;; Chinese scholars used it in this sense in naming other locations or regions of Southeast Asia, such as Annam.

Thus, &quot;Funan&quot; may be an originally Chinese word, and may not be a transcription at all. Jacques proposed that use of the name Funan should be abandoned in favour of the names, such as &quot;Bhavapura&quot;, &quot;Aninditapura&quot;, &quot;Shresthapura&quot; and &quot;Vyadhapura&quot;, which are known from inscriptions to have been used at the time for cities in the region, as opposed to &quot;Funan&quot; or &quot;Zhenla&quot; which are unknown in the Old Khmer language.

==Sources==

The first modern scholar to reconstruct the history of the ancient polity of Funan was Paul Pelliot, who in his ground-breaking article &quot;Le Fou-nan&quot; of 1903 drew exclusively on Chinese historical records to set forth the sequence of documented events connecting the foundation of Funan in approximately the 1st century CE with its demise by conquest in the 6th to 7th century. Scholars critical of Pelliot&#x27;s Chinese sources have expressed scepticism regarding his conclusions.

First record dated 84 CE in late Han period 后汉书.
Chinese records dating from the 3rd century CE, beginning with the (, Records of the Three Kingdoms) completed in 289 CE by Chén Shòu (; 233–297), record the arrival of two Funanese embassies at the court of (), governor in the southern Chinese kingdom of Wú (): the first embassy arrived between 225 and 230 CE, the second in the year 243. Later sources such as the Liáng shū (, Book of Liang) of Yáo Chá (; 533–606) and (, d. 637), completed in 636, discuss the mission of the 3rd-century Chinese envoys Kang Tai () and () from the Kingdom of Wu to Funan. The writings of these envoys, though no longer extant in their original condition, were excerpted and as such preserved in the later dynastic histories, and form the basis for much of what we know about Funan.

Since the publication of Pelliot&#x27;s article, archaeological excavation in Vietnam and Cambodia, especially excavation of sites related to the Óc Eo culture, have supported and supplemented his conclusion.

==History==


===Origins of Funan===
Chinese sources relate a local legend to document Funan&#x27;s origin, that a foreigner named &quot;Huntian (混填)&quot; [pinyin: Hùntián] established the Kingdom of Funan around the 1st century CE in the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam. Archeological evidence shows that extensive human settlement in the region may go as far back as the 4th century BCE. Though treated by Chinese historians as a single unified empire, according to some modern scholars Funan may have been a collection of city-states that sometimes warred with one another and at other times constituted a political unity.

The ethnic and linguistic origins of the Funanese people have consequently been subject to scholarly debate, and no firm conclusions can be drawn based on the evidence available. The Funanese may have been Cham or from another Austronesian group, or they may have been Khmer or from another Austroasiatic group. It is possible that they are the ancestors of those indigenous people dwelling in the southern part of Vietnam today who refer themselves as &quot;Khmer&quot; or &quot;Khmer Krom.&quot; The Khmer term &quot;krom&quot; means &quot;below&quot; or &quot;lower part of&quot; and is used to refer to territory that was later colonized by Vietnamese immigrants and taken up into the modern state of Vietnam. While no conclusive study to determine whether Funan&#x27;s ethnolinguistic components were Austronesian or Austroasiatic, there is dispute among scholars. According to the majority of Vietnamese academics, for example, Mac Duong, stipulates that &quot;Funan&#x27;s core population certainly were the Austronesians, not Khmer;&quot; the fall of Funan and the rise of Zhenla from the north in the 6th century indicate &quot;the arrival of the Khmer to the Mekong Delta.&quot; That thesis received support from D. G. E. Hall. Recent archaeological research lends weight to the conclusion that Funan was a Mon-Khmer polity. In his Funan review, Michael Vickery expresses himself a strong supporter of Funan&#x27;s Khmer predominance theory.

It is also possible that Funan was a multicultural society, including various ethnic and linguistic groups. In the late 4th and 5th centuries, Indianization advanced more rapidly, in part through renewed impulses from the south Indian Pallava dynasty and the north Indian Gupta Empire. The only extant local writings from the period of Funan are paleographic Pallava Grantha inscriptions in Sanskrit of the Pallava dynasty, a scholarly language used by learned and ruling elites throughout South and Southeast Asia. These inscriptions give no information about the ethnicity or vernacular tongue of the Funanese.

Funan may have been the Suvarnabhumi referred to in ancient Indian texts. Among the Khmer Krom of the lower Mekong region the belief is held that they are the descendants of ancient Funan, the core of Suvarnabhumi/Suvarnadvipa, which covered a vast extent of Southeast Asia including present day Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Burma, Malaya, Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia. In December 2017, Dr Vong Sotheara, of the Royal University of Phnom Penh, discovered a Pre-Angkorian stone inscription in the Province of Kampong Speu Baset District, which he tentatively dated to 633 CE. According to him, the inscription would “prove that Suvarnabhumi was the Khmer Empire.” The inscription, translated, read: “The great King Isanavarman is full of glory and bravery. He is the King of Kings, who rules over Suvarnabhumi until the sea, which is the border, while the kings in the neighbouring states honour his order to their heads”.

===Theories of origin and Indianisation===
====Multiple sources of the origin====

Huntian/Kaundinya I

The Book of Liang records a local legend to document Funan&#x27;s origin, that of the foundation of Funan by the foreigner Hùntián (, Middle Chinese pronunciation /ɦwənx tɦian/): &quot;He came from the southern country Jiào (, an unidentified location, perhaps on the Malaysian Peninsula or in the Indonesian archipelago) after dreaming that his personal genie had delivered a divine bow to him and had directed him to embark on a large merchant junk. In the morning, he proceeded to the temple, where he found a bow at the foot of the genie&#x27;s tree. He then boarded a ship, which the genie caused to land in Fúnán. The queen of the country, Liǔyè (, &quot;Willow Leaf&quot;; Queen Soma, Middle Chinese: &quot;Iiu-iap&quot;) wanted to pillage the ship and seize it, so Hùntián shot an arrow from his divine bow which pierced through Liǔyè&#x27;s ship. Frightened, she gave herself up, and Hùntián took her for his wife. But unhappy to see her naked, he folded a piece of material to make a garment through which he made her pass her head. Then he governed the country and passed power on to his son, who was the founder of seven cities.&quot; Nearly the same story appeared in the Jìn shū (Book of Jin), compiled by Fáng Xuánlíng in 648 CE; however, in the Book of Jin the names given to the foreign conqueror and his native wife are &quot;Hùnhuì&quot; and &quot;Yèliǔ&quot; .

Some scholars have identified the conqueror Hùntián of the Book of Liang with the Brahmin Kauṇḍinya who married a nāga (snake) princess named Somā, as set forth in a Sanskrit inscription found at Mỹ Sơn and dated 658 CE (see below). Other scholars have rejected this identification, pointing out that the word &quot;Hùntián&quot; has only two syllables, while the word &quot;Kauṇḍinya&quot; has three, and arguing that Chinese scholars would not have used a two-syllable Chinese word to transcribe a three-syllable word from another language.

The story of Kaundinya is also set forth briefly in the Sanskrit inscription C. 96 of the Cham king Prakasadharma found at Mỹ Sơn. It is dated Sunday, 18 February 658 CE (and thus belongs to the post-Funanese period) and states in relevant part (stanzas XVI-XVIII): &quot;It was there [at the city of Bhavapura] that Kauṇḍinya, the foremost among brahmins, planted the spear which he had obtained from Droṇa&#x27;s Son Aśvatthāman, the best of brahmins. There was a daughter of a king of serpents, called &quot;Somā&quot;, who founded a family in this world. Having attained, through love, to a radically different element, she lived in the abode of man. She was taken as wife by the excellent Brahmin Kauṇḍinya for the sake of (accomplishing) a certain task...&quot;.

 The Sanskrit inscription (K.5) of Tháp Mười (known as &quot;Prasat Pram Loven&quot; in Khmer), which is now on display in the Museum of Vietnamese History in Ho Chi Minh City, refers to a Prince Guṇavarman, younger son (&quot;nṛpasunu—bālo pi&quot;) of a king Ja[yavarman] who was &quot;the moon of the Kauṇḍinya line (&quot;...kauṇḍi[n]ya[vaṅ]śaśaśinā...&quot;) and chief &quot;of a realm wrested from the mud&quot;.

The legend of Kaundinya is paralleled in modern Khmer folklore, where the foreign prince is known as &quot;Preah Thaong&quot; and the queen as &quot;Neang Neak&quot;. In this version of the story, Preah Thaong arrives by sea to an island marked by a giant thlok tree, native to Cambodia. On the island, he finds the home of the nāgas and meets Neang Neak, daughter of the nāga king. He marries her with blessings from her father and returns to the human world. The nāga king drinks the sea around the island and confers the name &quot;Kampuchea Thipdei&quot;, which is derived from the Sanskrit (&quot;Kambujādhipati&quot;) and may be translated into English as &quot;the lord of Cambodia&quot;. In another version, it is stated that Preah Thaong fights Neang Neak.

Kaundinya II
Even if the Chinese &quot;Hùntián&quot; is not the proper transcription of the Sanskrit &quot;Kaundinya&quot;, the name &quot;Kaundinya&quot; [Kauṇḍinya, Koṇḍañña, Koṇḍinya, etc.] is nevertheless an important one in the history of Funan. Chinese sources mention another person of the name &quot;Qiáochénrú&quot; (). A person of that name is mentioned in the Book of Liang in a story that appears somewhat after the story of Hùntián.

According to this source, Qiáochénrú was one of the successors of the king Tiānzhú Zhāntán (, &quot;Candana from India&quot;), a ruler of Funan who in the year 357 CE sent tamed elephants as tribute to Emperor Mu of Jin (r. 344–361); personal name: Sīmǎ Dān (): &quot;He [Qiáochénrú] was originally a Brahmin from India. There a voice told him: &#x27;you must go reign over Fúnán,&#x27; and he rejoiced in his heart. In the south, he arrived at Pánpán (). The people of Fúnán appeared to him; the whole kingdom rose up with joy, went before him, and chose him king. He changed all the laws to conform to the system of India.&quot;

====Interpretation of the myths====

Keneth Hall remarks that the basic details of the Chinese legend are reiterated elsewhere in Indian and Southeast Asian folklore.

The historian Gabriel Ferrand believed that some Indian merchants might have immigrated to the region and established relations with the natives and that&#x27;s how the myth emerged. Some Indian historians have taken this myth to extreme length and speculate that a large population of South Asians colonized Funan. Dutch historian J.C. van Leur stressed that it was the local rulers who recognized the benefits of associating with their relatively advanced social technologies and drew from the Indian traditions by encouraging migration of Brahmin clerks to help with the administration.

As per O.W. Wolters, there was a mutual sharing process in the evolution of Indianized statecraft and no mass influx of Brahmans. He said that it was rather the Indianized local Southeast Asian traders who provided the initial contact with Indian cultural traditions and the local rulers followed up. He also stated that Hindu traditions was selectively mobilized by the local rulers to strengthen the political alliances among fragile polity of the states in that period.

===Apex and decline of Funan===
Successive rulers following Hun-t&#x27;ien included Hun-p&#x27;an-huang, P&#x27;an-p&#x27;an, and then Fan Shih-man, &quot;Great King of Funan&quot;, who &quot;had large ships built, and sailing all over the immense sea he attacked more than ten kingdoms... he extended his territory five or six thousand li.&quot; Fan Shih-man died on a military expedition to Chin-lin, &quot;Frontier of Gold&quot;. He was followed by Chin-cheng, Fan Chan, Ch&#x27;ang and then Fan Hsun, in successive assassinations. Before his death, Fan Chan sent embassies to India and China in 243.

Around 245, Funan was described as having &quot;walled villages, palaces, and dwellings. They devote themselves to agriculture... they like to engrave ornaments and chisel. Many of their eating utensils are silver. Taxes are paid in gold, silver, pearls, perfumes. There are books and depositories of archives and other things.&quot; The Indianised ruler Chan-T&#x27;an was ruling in 357, followed by another Indianised ruler Chiao Chen-ju (Kaundinya) in the fifth century, who &quot;changed all the laws to conform to the system of India.&quot; In 480, She-yeh-pa-mo, Jayavarman or &quot;Protege of Victory&quot; reigned until his death in 514. One of his sons, Rudravarman, killed the other, Gunavarman, for the throne, and became the last king of Funan.

Funan reached the apex of its power under the 3rd-century king Fan Shiman (). Fan Shiman expanded his empire&#x27;s navy and improved the Funanese bureaucracy, creating a quasi-feudal pattern that left local customs and identities largely intact, particularly in the empire&#x27;s further reaches. Fan Shiman and his successors also sent ambassadors to China and India to regulate sea trade. The kingdom likely accelerated the process of Indianization of Southeast Asia. Later kingdoms of Southeast Asia such as Chenla may have emulated the Funanese court. The Funanese established a strong system of mercantilism and commercial monopolies that would become a pattern for empires in the region.

Funan&#x27;s dependence on maritime trade is seen as a cause for the beginning of Funan&#x27;s downfall. Their coastal ports allowed trade with foreign regions that funnelled goods to the north and coastal populations. However, the shift in maritime trade to Sumatra, the rise in the Srivijaya trade empire, and the taking of trade routes all throughout Southeast Asia by China, leads to economic instability in the south, and forces politics and economy northward.

Funan was superseded and absorbed in the 6th century by the Khmer polity of the Chenla Kingdom (Zhenla). &quot;The king had his capital in the city of T&#x27;e-mu. Suddenly his city was subjugated by Chenla, and he had to migrate south to the city of Nafuna&quot; (Middle Chinese: &quot;*nâ-piiidt-nâ&quot;).

The &quot;Book of Sui&quot; (complied in 636) states: &quot;The Kingdom of Zhenla is to the southwest of Linyi and was originally subject to Funan… The surname of its [former] king was that of the Cha-li clan; his given name was Zhiduo-si-na 質多斯那. His ancestors had gradually become more powerful and flourishing until the time of Zhi-duo-sina himself, who annexed Funan and possessed it.&quot; The &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; (c. 1060) tells that &quot;Yīshēnàxiāndài (伊奢那先代), son of Citrasena-Mahendravarman, subdued Funan and annexed Funan territory in the beginning of the Zhenguan era (627–649) [when Emperor Taizong of Tang
ruled].&quot;

The first inscription in the Khmer language is dated shortly after the fall of Funan. A concentration of later Khmer inscriptions in southern Cambodia may suggest the even earlier presence of a Khmer population. Despite absence of compelling evidence as to the ethnicity of the Funanese, modern scholar Michael Vickery has stated that &quot;on present evidence it is impossible to assert that Funan as an area and its dominant groups were anything but Khmer&quot;.

===Rump states elsewhere===
According to British Historian Robert Nichol, When Funan kingdom collapsed under Khmer invasions, during the year 680, the Sailendra Dynasty set up rump states of Funan in the small kingdoms of Sarawak in Borneo across the South China sea, from Funan. He also posited blood relations with the Visayans in the Philippines with the Vijaya of Sarawak which in turn cause them to be related to Funan people as well as the Srivijaya Empire.

===Legacy===
The &quot;King of the mountain&quot; was the monarch of Funan. There was a mountain regarded as holy. Mountain in Khmer sounds similar to Funan.

The Java-based Sailendras claimed that the Funan monarchs were their ancestors. Cambodia was taken control of after a sojourn in Java by Jayavarman II.

The &quot;Mountain Kings&quot; of Funan were claimed as the forebears of the Malacca Sultanate and Brunei Sultanate.

==Society==
Keeping in mind that Funanese records did not survive in the modern period, much of what is known came from archaeological excavation. Excavations yielded discoveries of brick wall structures, precious metals and pot from southern Cambodia and Vietnam. Also found was a large canal system that linked the settlements of Angkor Borei and coastal outlets; this suggests a highly organised government. Funan was a complex and sophisticated society with a high population density, advanced technology, and a complex social system.

===Capital===
On the assumption that Funan was a single unified polity, scholars have advanced various linguistic arguments about the location of its &quot;capital&quot;.
* One theory, based on the presumed connection between the word &quot;Funan&quot; and the Khmer word &quot;phnom&quot;, locates the capital in the vicinity of Ba Phnoṃ near the modern Cambodian town of Banam in Prey Veng Province.
* Another theory, propounded by George Coedès, is that the capital was a town identified in Angkorian inscriptions as &quot;Vyādhapura&quot; (&quot;City of the Hunter&quot;). Coedès based his theory on a passage in the Chinese histories which identified the capital as &quot;Temu&quot; (, ); Coedès claimed this name represented a transcription from the Khmer word &quot;dalmāk&quot;, which he translated as &quot;hunter.&quot; This theory has been rejected by other scholars on the grounds that &quot;dalmāk&quot; means &quot;trapper&quot;, not &quot;hunter&quot;.

Unfortunately, only limited archaeological research has been conducted on Funan in southern Cambodia and Cochinchina in the last few decades, and it is precisely this region that reputedly housed the capital or capitals of Funan. However, archaeological surveys and excavations were carried out by joint Cambodian (Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts; Royal University of Fine Arts) and international teams at Angkor Borei since 1994 continuing into the 2000s. The research included excavation and dating of human burials at Wat Kamnou. Numerous brick features, architectural remains, and landscape features such as mounds, canals and reservoirs have also been identified.

Some have been dated with a wide spectrum of results ranging from the late centuries BCE to the Angkorian period. A significant canal system linking the site of Oc Eo has also been researched and dated. Phon Kaseka led a Royal Academy of Cambodia and Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts team (also with Royal University of Fine Arts personnel) conducted Iron Age to Funan period burial excavations at neighboring Phnom Borei. Large landscape features, notable settlement mounds, and other sites exhibiting Funan material culture and settlement patterns extend from at least Phnom Chisor through Oc Eo and numerous sites in Vietnam. Vietnamese archaeologists have also conducted a fair amount of research on Funan sites in the lower Mekong region.

Many of the mounds show evidence of material culture and landscape modification (inclusive of species-genera biological regimes) ranging from the metal age through the post-Angkorian period and later as evidenced by 13th through 16th century CE Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Cham ceramics. The evidence suggests a 2000-year or longer period of urbanization, continuous activity, and relatively strong albeit indirect and multi-nodal connections to long-distance value chains. Nevertheless, it is quite evident that periods of intense production, consumption, activity, commercial and political centrality fluctuated.

The Funan period seems to have been the heyday and Angkor Borei may have been Funan&#x27;s premiere capital for much of that period. However, many of the settlements did not necessarily spring up out of nowhere or vanish quickly. They were certainly well integrated into pre-Funan, Funan, Zhenla [Chenla], Angkorian and post-Angkorian socio-economic and political networks. The urbanization and networking processes demonstrate significant continuity, evolution and longevity before and after the typical first to sixth century CE historic classification scheme.

===Culture===
Funanese culture was a mixture of native beliefs and Indian ideas. The kingdom is said to have been heavily influenced by Indian culture, and to have employed Indians for state administration purposes. Sanskrit was the language at the court, and the Funanese advocated Hinduism and, after the fifth century, Buddhist religious doctrines. Records show that taxes were paid in silver, gold, pearls, and perfumed wood. Kang Tai () and Zhu Ying () reported that the Funanese practised slavery and that justice was rendered through trial by ordeal, including such methods as carrying a red-hot iron chain and retrieving gold rings and eggs from boiling water.

Archaeological evidence largely corresponds to Chinese records. The Chinese described the Funanese as people who lived on stilt houses, cultivated rice and sent tributes of gold, silver, ivory and exotic animals.

Kang Tai&#x27;s report was unflattering to Funanese civilisation, though Chinese court records show that a group of Funanese musicians visited China in 263 CE. The Chinese emperor was so impressed that he ordered the establishment of an institute for Funanese music near Nanking. The Funanese were reported to have extensive book collections and archives throughout their country, demonstrating a high level of scholarly achievements.

Two Buddhist monks from Funan, named Mandrasena and Sanghapala, took up residency in China in the 5th to 6th centuries, and translated several Buddhist sūtras from Sanskrit (or a prakrit) into Chinese. Among these texts is the Mahayana &quot;Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, also called the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitā Mañjuśrīparivarta Sūtra&quot;. This text was separately translated by both monks. The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī is a prominent figure in this text.

===Economy===
Funan was Southeast Asia&#x27;s first great economy. It became prosperous through maritime trade and agriculture. The kingdom apparently minted its own silver coinage, bearing the image of the crested argus or hamsa bird.

Funan came into prominence at a time when the trade route from India to China consisted of a maritime leg from India to the Isthmus of Kra, the narrow portion of the Malay peninsula, a portage across the isthmus, and then a coast-hugging journey by ship along the Gulf of Siam, past the Mekong Delta, and along the Vietnamese coast to China. Funanese kings of the 2nd century conquered polities on the isthmus itself, and thus may have controlled the entire trade route from Malaysia to central Vietnam.

The Funanese settlement of Óc Eo, located near the Straits of Malacca, provided a port-of-call and entrepot for this international trade route. Archaeological evidence discovered at what may have been the commercial centre of Funan at Óc Eo includes Roman as well as Persian, Indian, and Greek artefacts. The German classical scholar Albrecht Dihle believed that Funan&#x27;s main port, was the Kattigara referred to by the 2nd century Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy as the emporium where merchants from the Chinese and Roman empires met to trade. Dihle also believed that the location of Óc Eo best fit the details given by Ptolemy of a voyage made by a Graeco-Roman merchant named Alexander to Kattigara, situated at the easternmost end of the maritime trade route from the eastern Roman Empire.

Georges Coedès said: &quot;Fu-nan occupied a key position with regard to the maritime trade routes, and was inevitably a port of call both for the navigators who went through the Straits of Malacca and for those – probably more numerous – who made the transit over one of the isthmuses of the Malay Peninsula. Fu-nan may even have been the terminus of voyages from the Eastern Mediterranean, if it is the case that the Kattigara mentioned by Ptolemy was situated on the western coast of Indochina on the Gulf of Siam&quot;.
At Óc Eo, Roman coins were among the items of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s. These include mid-2nd-century Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius, and his adopted son and heir Marcus Aurelius. From Óc Eo, archaeologists also found a fine gold pendant imitation of a &quot;aureus&quot; of Antoninus minted in 152 AD with caption ANTONINVS AVG PIVS (Antoninus Aug(ustus) Pius) and portrait of the emperor turning left. Similar gold sheet discs that imitated Roman coins minted by local Funanese also are rediscovered, included imitations of aureus of Antoninus (minted in 155–158), Commodus ( 192), Septimius Severus ( 198–202), perhaps the minting techniques were brought by traders including those from the Roman Empire. It is perhaps no small coincidence that the first Roman embassy from &quot;Daqin&quot; recorded in Chinese history is dated 166 AD, allegedly sent by a Roman ruler named &quot;Andun&quot; (; corresponding with the names Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) and arriving through the Eastern Han Empire&#x27;s southernmost frontier province of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam.

In addition to trade, Funan also benefited from a sophisticated agricultural system that included use of an elaborate system of water storage and irrigation. The Funanese population was concentrated mainly along the rivers of the Mekong Delta; the area was a natural region for the development of an economy based on fishing and rice cultivation.

===Foreign relations===
Little is known about Funan&#x27;s political history apart from its relations with China. The Funanese had diplomatic relations and traded with the Eastern Wu and Liang dynasties of southern China. Contact with Southeast Asia began after the Southward expansion of the Han dynasty, and the annexation of Nanyue and other kingdoms situated in southern China. Goods imported or modelled on those from China, like bronze axes, have been excavated in Cambodia. An Eastern Wu embassy was sent from China to Funan in 228. A brief conflict is recorded to have happened in the 270s, when Funan and its neighbour, Linyi, joined forces to attack the area of Tongking (Vietnamese: Đông Kinh, &quot;eastern capital&quot;), located in what is now modern Northern Vietnam (which was a Chinese colony at the time).

Funan maintained diplomatic relations with the Murunda dynasty of northern Kalinga during 3rd cen CE, when King Dhamadamadhara (Dharmatamadharasya) of Murunda received envoy Su-Wu who represented King Fan Chan of Funan (225–250 CE).

According to Chinese sources, Funan was eventually conquered and absorbed by its vassal polity Chenla (pinyin: Zhēnlà). Chenla was a Khmer polity, and its inscriptions are in both Sanskrit and in Khmer. The last known ruler of Funan was Rudravarman (, pinyin: ) who ruled from 514 up to c. 545 CE.

The French historian Georges Coedès once hypothesized a relation between the rulers of Funan and the Shailendra dynasty of Indonesia. Coedès believed that the title of &quot;mountain lord&quot; used by the Sailendra kings may also have been used by the kings of Funan, since he also believed that the name &quot;Funan&quot; was a Chinese transcription related to the Khmer &quot;phnom&quot;, which means &quot;mountain.&quot; Other scholars have rejected this hypothesis, pointing to the lack of evidence in early Cambodian epigraphy for the use of any such titles.

People who came from the coast of Funan are also known to establish Chi Tu (the Red Earth Kingdom) in the Malay Peninsula. The Red Earth Kingdom is thought to be a derivation nation of Funan with its own kind of Khmer culture.

<text>Japan has been ruled by emperors since antiquity. The sequence, order and dates of the early emperors are almost entirely based on the 8th-century &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which was meant to retroactively legitimise the Imperial House by dating its foundation further back to the year 660 BC. There are several theories as to who was the first Japanese ruler supported by historical evidence: notable candidates are Emperor Yūryaku (r. 456–479) and Emperor Kinmei (r. 539–571), among others.

The terms &quot;Tennō&quot; (&#x27;Emperor&#x27;, 天皇), as well as &quot;Nihon&quot; (&#x27;Japan&#x27;, 日本), were not adopted until the late 7th century AD. In the &quot;nengō&quot; system which has been in use since the late 7th century, years are numbered using the Japanese era name and the number of years which have elapsed since the start of that &quot;nengō&quot; era.

<doc id="224387" wikidata="Q562566" url="?curid=224387" title="Breach of contract">
<text>Breach of contract is a legal cause of action and a type of civil wrong, in which a binding agreement or bargained-for exchange is not honored by one or more of the parties to the contract by non-performance or interference with the other party&#x27;s performance. Breach occurs when a party to a contract fails to fulfill its obligation(s), whether partially or wholly, as described in the contract, or communicates an intent to fail the obligation or otherwise appears not to be able to perform its obligation under the contract. Where there is breach of contract, the resulting damages have to be paid to the aggrieved party by the party breaching the contract.

If a contract is rescinded, parties are legally allowed to undo the work unless doing so would directly charge the other party at that exact time.

== What constitutes a breach of contract ==
There exists two elementary forms of breach of contract.

The first is actual failure to perform the contract as and when specified constitutes the first and most obvious type of breach. A contract lays down what must be done, what cannot be done, and when it must be done. If what was prescribed has not been done within the stipulated or reasonable period, there has been a breach of contract.

A further form of breach of contract is conduct indicating an unwillingness or inability to perform an obligation arising from that contract. 

As noted by Seddon et al, these forms of breach of contract overlap, and an actual failure to perform may manifest an unwillingness or inability to perform. This is not always the case: an individual may fail to perform a contractual obligation even when willing or able.

These classifications describe only &quot;how&quot; a contract can be breached, not how serious the breach is. A judge will make a decision on whether a contract was breached based on the claims of both parties.

The first type above is an &quot;actual&quot; breach of contract. 
The two other types are breaches as to the future performance of the contract and are technically known as &quot;renunciatory&quot; breaches. The defaulting party renunciates the contract in advance of when it is required to performs its obligations. Renunciatory breach is more commonly known as &quot;anticipatory breach.&quot;

==Classifications of breaches of contract==

The general law has three categories of breaches of contract, which measure of the seriousness of the breach. 
In the absence of a contractual or statutory provision, any breach of contract is categorized:
* breach of warranty;
* breach of condition; or 
* breach of an innominate term, otherwise known as an &quot;intermediate&quot; term.

There is no &quot;internal rating system&quot; within each of these categories (such as &quot;a serious breach of warranty&quot;). Any breach of contract is of a breach of warranty, condition or innominate term.

In terms of priority of classification of these terms, a term of a contract is an innominate term unless it is clear that it is intended to be a condition or a warranty.

*Woods v N J Ellingham &amp; Co Ltd [1977] 1 NZLR 218

==Rights to damages for breach==
Any breach of contract (warranty, condition or innominate term) gives rise to a right in the hands of the innocent party to recover their damage suffered which caused by the breach of contract by the defaulting party. Damages in the UK are the only remedy available for breach of a warranty. Those damages can come in different forms such as an award of monetary damages, liquidation damages, specific performances, rescission, and restitution.

Damages are classified as being compensatory or punitive. Compensatory damages are rewarded in an attempt to make place the innocent party in the position that would have been occupied &quot;but for&quot; the breach. Those damages are most often awarded as payments. Punitive damages are given to &quot;punish or make an example of a wrongdoer who has acted willfully, maliciously or fraudulently&quot;. Punitive damages are awarded only in extreme cases and usually along with compensatory damages.

==Damages for disappointment==
Damages for distress or disappointment are not generally allowed by the courts, but cases where the award of such damages has been considered and agreed include Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd (1972) and Farley v Skinner (2001).

==Right to terminate for breach==
A right to terminate a contract arises for:
# &quot;breach of a condition&quot; of the contract, no matter how trivial the breach of the condition may be; 
# &quot;repudiatory breach&quot;, that is an actual breach of an innominate term, where the consequence of the breach is sufficiently serious to give rise to a right to terminate; or
# &quot;renunciatory breach&quot; (aka anticipatory breach), where the other party makes clear to the innocent party that it: 
## is not going to perform the contract at all, or 
## is going to commit a breach of a condition, or 
## is going to commit a breach of an innominate term, 
:: and the consequences will be such as to entitle the innocent party to treat the contract as at an end.

An innocent party is therefore entitled to elect to terminate a contract only for breach of a condition of the contract, repudiatory breach or renunciatory breach.

To terminate a contract for repudiatory breach, the innocent party must tell the defaulting party. Many commercial contracts include clauses that set out a process whereby notice must be given and in what form. Consequently, if there is a written contract, care should be taken to check the contract terms and to ensure compliance notwithstanding that the other party may, on the face of it, have committed a clear and repudiatory breach. It is only when the defaulting party is told that a repudiatory breach has been &quot;accepted&quot; that the contract is terminated. If the defaulting party is not told the repudiatory breach has been accepted, the contract continues in force. An innocent party is not compelled to exercise its right to terminate, and accept a repudiatory breach. Otherwise, the contract continues in force.

===Repudiatory breaches===
Conduct is repudiatory if it deprives the innocent party of &quot;substantially the whole of the benefit&quot; intended to be received as consideration for performance of its future obligations under the contract. Different forms of words are used by courts to express this central concept. The most prominent is whether the breach goes to &quot;the root of the contract&quot;. Those forms of words are simply different ways of expressing the &quot;substantially the whole benefit&quot; test.

Sometimes the innocent party may be deprived of its entitlement to damages for repudiatory breach of contract:
*if the innocent party is &quot;irremediably disabled from performance&quot;, provided that that inability to perform on the part of the innocent party is not itself attributable to the repudiatory breach;
*if the innocent party has &quot;a settled intention not to perform&quot;.

===Renunciatory breaches===
Conduct is renunciatory if it shows an intention to commit a repudiatory breach. The conduct would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the party does not intend to perform its future obligations when they fall due.

Showing an intention to perform a contract in a manner which is &quot;inconsistent&quot; with the terms of the contract also shows an intention not to perform the contract. Whether such conduct is so severe so as to amount to a renunciatory breached depends upon whether the threatened difference in performance is repudiatory. An intention to perform connotes a willingness to perform, but willingness in this context does not mean a desire to perform despite an inability to do so. To say &quot;I would like to but I cannot&quot; negatives intent just as much as &quot;I will not&quot;. Contracting parties must perform contracts in strict accordance with their terms: what was agreed in the first instance when the contract was formed. To do otherwise is therefore a breach of contract.

In the event of a renunciatory breach, the innocent party may:
* choose to accept the breach at once and to terminate the contract, without waiting for the due date of performance, or 
* wait for the time for performance of the contract. 
If the defaulting party does not perform when the time for performance arrives, the contract may be terminated. However, if the defaulting party performs, the right to terminate is lost forever.

Conduct comprising a breach for performance of contractual obligations that have fallen due may be insufficient to be a repudiation. However:
* Nevertheless, conduct may be a renunciation because it would lead the reasonable observer to conclude that there was an intention not to perform in the future, and 
* the past and threatened future breaches taken together would be repudiatory.

The reason for a defaulting party committing an actual breach is generally irrelevant to whether it constitutes a breach, or whether the breach is a repudiation (this is an incident of &quot;strict liability&quot; for the performance of contractual obligations). However, the reason may be highly relevant to what such breach would lead the reasonable observer to conclude about the defaulting party&#x27;s intentions in relation to future performance and therefore to the issue of renunciation. Often, the question whether conduct is a renunciation falls to be judged by reference to the defaulting party&#x27;s intention, which is objectively evinced by past breaches and other words and conduct.

==Breach of warranty==

A breach of a warranty of a contract creates a right to damages for the loss suffered, which was caused by the breach. These &quot;minor&quot; breaches do not entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract. The innocent party cannot sue the party in default for specific performance: only damages. Injunctions (specific performance is a type of injunction) to restrain further breach of a warranty are likely to be refused on the basis that (1) injunctions are a discretionary remedy, and (2) damages are an adequate remedy in the circumstances of the case.

Suppose a homeowner hires a contractor to install new plumbing and insists that the pipes, which will ultimately be hidden behind the walls, must be red. The contractor instead uses blue pipes that function just as well. Although the contractor breached the literal terms of the contract, the homeowner cannot ask a court to order the contractor to replace the blue pipes with red pipes. The homeowner can only recover the amount of his or her actual damages. In this instance, this is the difference in value between red pipe and blue pipe. Since the color of a pipe does not affect its function, the difference in value is zero. Therefore, no damages have been incurred and the homeowner would receive nothing (see &quot;Jacob &amp; Youngs v. Kent&quot;.)

However, had the pipe color been specified in the agreement as a &quot;condition&quot;, a breach of that condition may well constitute a &quot;major&quot;—i.e. a repudiatory breach. Simply because a term in a contract is stated by the parties to be a condition does not necessarily make it so. Such statements though are one of the factors taken into account to decide whether it is a condition or warranty of the contract. Other than where the colour of the pipes went to the root of the contract (suppose the pipes were to be used in a room dedicated to artwork related to plumbing, or dedicated to high fashion), it would more than likely be a warranty, not a condition.

The general rule is that stipulations as to time in a contract are not conditions of the contract (there are exceptions, such as in shipping contracts; it depends in part upon the commercial importance of timely delivery in all the circumstances of the case). As such, missing a date for performance stipulated in a contract is usually a breach of warranty. However, when a contract specifies time is of the essence or otherwise contains an express or implied term that times for performance are critical, stipulations as to time will be &quot;conditions&quot; of the contract. Accordingly, if a party fails to meet a meet the time stipulations, it will be a breach of a condition of the contract, entitling the innocent party to terminate.

==Breach of a condition==
Breach of a &quot;condition&quot; of a contract is known as a &quot;repudiatory breach&quot;. Again, a repudiatory breach entitles the innocent party at common law to (1) terminate the contract, and (2) claim damages. No other type of breach except a repudiatory breach is sufficiently serious to permit the innocent party to terminate the contract for breach.

==Types of breach==
Contracts often use wording other than &quot;repudiatory breach&quot; to describe a type of breach of contract. These contractual terms include &quot;material breach&quot;, &quot;fundamental breach&quot;, &quot;substantial breach&quot;, &quot;serious breach&quot;. These alternative wordings have no fixed meaning in law but are interpreted within the context of the contract that they are used. For that reason, the meaning of the different terms varies from case to case. Possible interpretations of their meaning include &quot;repudiatory breach&quot;, and &quot;serious breach, but not as serious as a repudiatory breach&quot;.

===Trivial breach===
A &quot;trivial breach&quot; is one that does not meet the standard for designation as a material, serious or substantial breach.

An Arizona Supreme Court decision in a 1990 commercial retail lease case noted that &quot;the overwhelming majority of [US] jurisdictions... hold the landlord&#x27;s right to terminate is not unlimited. We believe a court&#x27;s decision to permit termination must be tempered by notions of equity and common sense. We thus hold a forfeiture for a trivial or immaterial breach of a commercial lease should not be enforced.&quot;

In Rice (t/a The Garden Guardian) v Great Yarmouth Borough Council (2000), the UK Court of Appeal decided that a clause which provided that the contract could be terminated &quot;if the contractor commits a breach of any of its obligations under the contract&quot; should not be given its literal meaning: it was considered &quot;contrary to business common sense&quot; to allow any breach at all, however trivial, to create grounds for termination.

===Material breach===
A &quot;material breach&quot; has been held to mean &quot;a breach of contract which is more than trivial, but need not be repudiatory&quot; and confirmed as meaning &quot;a breach which is substantial. The breach must be a serious matter, rather than a matter of little consequence.&quot; A breach of contract will likely constitute a material breach if the term of the contract which has been breached is a condition of the contract. A variety of tests may be applied to terms of contracts to decide whether a term is a warranty or a condition of the contract.

In respect to the EPC Agreements, material breach is defined as &quot;shall mean a breach by either Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement which has or is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Project and which such Party shall have failed to cure&quot;.

Other UK cases which relate to the concept of a material breach include:
*National Power plc v United Gas Company Ltd. (1998), where Colman J considered wording relating to &quot;a material breach of any of [the guilty party&#x27;s] obligations&quot;, allowing termination of the contract if remedy of such breach had not been commenced within seven days. The judge ruled that recognition that a material breach might be remedied distinguished the concept from a repudiatory breach, and there was no commercial sense in a clause restricting the common law rights of the innocent party, in relation to a repudiatory breach, and therefore &quot;material breach&quot; must refer to a form of breach which is not repudiatory. 
*Glolite Ltd. v Jasper Conran Ltd. (1998), where Neuberger J stated that and that
*Phoenix Media Limited v Cobweb Information (2000) 
*Dalkia Utilities Services plc v Celtech International (2006) noted that assessing &quot;materiality&quot; involved looking at the actual breaches, their consequences, [the guilty party&#x27;s] explanation for the breaches, their context within the agreement, the consequences of holding the agreement determined and the consequences of allowing the agreement to continue. Financial difficulties experienced by Celtech meant that they missed three payments out of 174 due over the 15 year life of the contract. These represented 8.5% of the total contract sum and were therefore not trivial or minimal, but Celtech were making attempts to pay and therefore not in repudiatory breach. Celtech were, however, in material breach of the contract and the contractual right to terminate could therefore be exercised by Dalkia.
*Gallaher International Ltd v Tlias Enterprises (2008) 
*Crosstown Music Company v Rive Droite Music Ltd (2009), also making the point that a &quot;material&quot; breach was more significant than a &quot;trivial&quot; breach. Mann J referred to the &quot;Dalkia&quot; and &quot;Gallaher&quot; cases in his speech.

==Right to remedy a breach==
A party in breach of contract may have the right to remedy their breach, for example if the breach itself is remediable and a provision for remedy or a time period for exercising such as right is included within the contract. In the case of Vinergy International (PVT) Ltd v Richmond Mercantile Limited FZC (2016), a clause within the contract between the disputing parties stated that &quot;failure ... to observe any of the terms herein and to remedy the same where it is capable of being remedied within the period specified in the notice given by the aggrieved party to the party in default, calling for remedy, being a period not less than twenty (20) days&quot; would constitute grounds for termination of the contract. The period allowed for such a remedy may be referred to as a &quot;cure period&quot;. A right to make use of a cure period may not be available where the innocent party chooses to accept a repudiatory breach and therefore exercise its common law rather than its contractual rights.

==Fundamental breach==

&quot;Fundamental breach&quot; of contract is no longer the test for a serious breach of contract to justify termination. The test is that set out for repudiatory breach, above. The concept of fundamental breach as a free standing legal concept no longer has any legal force but is now simply another possible term of a contract that needs to be construed like any other term of a contract.

A &quot;fundamental breach&quot; is usually read as a reference to a repudiatory breach.

A term may be a condition in Australian law if it satisfies one test known as the test of essentiality. The test of essentiality requires that the promise (term) was of such importance to the promisee that he or she would not have entered into the contract without the assurance of strict or substantial performance of the promise, and that ought to have been apparent to the promisor. This is an objective test of the parties&#x27; intention at the time of formation of the contract.

If the contractor in the above example had been instructed to use copper pipes but instead used iron pipes that would not last as long as the copper pipes would have lasted, the homeowner can recover the cost of actually correcting the breach by taking out the iron pipes and replacing them with copper pipes.

There are exceptions. Legal scholars and courts have been known to find that the owner of a house whose pipes are not the specified grade or quality (a typical hypothetical example) cannot recover the cost of replacing the pipes for the following reasons:

# Economic waste. The law does not favor tearing down or destroying something that is valuable (almost anything with value is &quot;valuable&quot;). In this case, significant destruction of the house would be required to completely replace the pipes and so the law is hesitant to enforce damages of that nature. See &quot;Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co.&quot;.
# Pricing in. In most cases of breach, a party to the contract simply fails to perform one or more terms. In those cases, the breaching party should have already considered the cost to perform those terms and thus &quot;keeps&quot; that cost when it does not perform. That party should not be entitled to keep those savings. However, in the pipe example, the contractor never considered the cost of tearing down a house to fix the pipes and so to expect it to pay damages of that nature is unreasonable.

Most homeowners would be unable to collect damages that compensate them for replacing the pipes but would be awarded damages that compensate them for the &quot;loss of value&quot; in the house. For example, if the house is worth $125,000 with copper and $120,000 with iron pipes, the homeowner would be able to collect the $5,000 difference and nothing more.

In the United States, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts lists the following criteria to determine whether a specific failure constitutes a material breach:

==Anticipatory breach==

Renunciatory breach (usually referred to as &quot;anticipatory breach&quot; or &quot;breach by anticipatory repudiation&quot;) is an unequivocal indication that the party will not perform when performance falls due or a situation in which future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the innocent party the option to terminate the contract immediately and sue for damages or to wait for the time of performance. If the party required to perform does not do so when it is required by the contract, the innocent party can terminate then.

For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15, A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, the contract continues on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless an actual breach occurs.

<doc id="224389" wikidata="Q4579943" url="?curid=224389" title="Direct insolation">
<text>Direct insolation is the insolation measured at a given location on Earth with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun&#x27;s rays, excluding diffuse insolation (the solar radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components in the sky). Direct insolation is equal to the solar irradiance above the atmosphere minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. While the solar irradiance above the atmosphere varies with the Earth–Sun distance and solar cycles, the losses depend on the time of day (length of light&#x27;s path through the atmosphere depending on the solar elevation angle), cloud cover, humidity, and other impurities.

==Simplified formula==
A simple formula gives the approximate level of direct insolation when there are no clouds:

formula_1

where &quot;AM&quot; is the airmass given by

formula_2

with θ being the zenith angle (90° minus the altitude) of the sun.

For the sun at the zenith, this gives 947 W/m2. However, another source states that direct sunlight under these conditions, with 1367 W/m2 above the atmosphere, is about 1050 W/m2, and total insolation about 1120 W/m2.

==Average direct insolation==
For practical purposes, a time-average of the direct insolation over the course of the year is commonly used. This averaging takes into account the absence of sunlight during the night, increased scatter in the morning and evening hours, average effects of cloud cover and smog, as well as seasonal variations of the mid-day solar elevation.

==Units of measurement==
Direct insolation is measured in watts per square metre (W/m2) or kilowatt-hours per square meter per day (kW·h/(m2·day)). 

In the case of photovoltaics, average direct insolation is commonly measured in terms of peak direct insolation as kWh/(kWp·y) (kilowatt hours per year per kilowatt peak rating).

==Applications==
Since radiation directly from the sun can be focussed with mirrors and lens, it can be applied to concentrated solar thermal (CST) systems. Due to clouds and aerosols, the direct insolation can fluctuate throughout the day, so forecasting the available resource is important in these applications

<text>Petrels are tube-nosed seabirds in the phylogenetic order Procellariiformes.

==Description==
Petrels are a monophyletic group of marine seabirds, sharing a characteristic of a nostril arrangement that results in the name &quot;tubenoses&quot;. Petrels encompass three of the four extant families within the Procellariiformes order, namely Procellariidae (fulmarine petrels, gadfly petrels, diving petrels, prions, and shearwaters), Hydrobatidae (northern storm petrels), and Oceanitidae (austral storm petrels). The remaining family in Procellariiformes is the albatross family, Diomedeidae.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;petrel&quot; (first recorded in that spelling 1703) comes from earlier (&quot;ca.&quot; 1670) &quot;pitteral&quot;; the English explorer William Dampier wrote the bird was so called from its way of flying with its feet just skimming the surface of the water, recalling Saint Peter&#x27;s walk on the sea of Galilee (Matthew xiv.28); if so, it likely was formed in English as a diminutive of Peter (&lt; Old (?) &lt; Late &lt; Late &lt; &lt; = &quot;stone&quot;).

==Known species==
All the members of the order are exclusively pelagic in distribution—returning to land only to breed.

The family Procellariidae is the main radiation of medium-sized true petrels, characterised by united nostrils with medium septum, and a long outer functional primary feather. It is dominant in the Southern Oceans, but not so in the Northern Hemisphere.

It includes a number of petrel groups, the relationships between which have finally been resolved to satisfaction.
* The fulmarine petrels: seven species of surface predators and filter feeders, breed in high latitudes but migrate along cool currents to the north. All but &quot;Fulmarus&quot; are essentially confined to the south, &quot;Fulmarus&quot; apparently colonised the Northern Hemisphere during the Early Miocene.
** The huge giant petrels, genus &quot;Macronectes&quot;, which are convergent with the albatrosses
** The true fulmars, genus &quot;Fulmarus&quot;
** Antarctic petrel &quot;Thalassoica antarctica&quot;
** Cape petrel &quot;Daption capense&quot;
** Snow petrel &quot;Pagodroma nivea&quot;
* The prions: A specialised group of a few very numerous species, all southern. They have a small, fulmar-like form and mostly filter-feed on zooplankton.
** &quot;Pachyptila&quot;, the prions proper
* The procellariine petrels, larger or mid-sized species feeding on fish and molluscs which are fairly close to the prions:
** &quot;Procellaria&quot;
** &quot;Bulweria&quot;
* Shearwaters: There are numerous species in several genera with a medium number of species.
** &quot;Calonectris&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus&quot;, which is two rather distinct groups of larger and smaller species
** &quot;Pseudobulweria&quot;
** Kerguelen petrel &quot;Lugensa brevirostris&quot;
* The gadfly petrels: These are a considerable number of agile short-billed petrels in the genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot; which include the endangered Bermuda petrel (or cahow) and a considerable number of forms rendered extinct by human activity.
* The diving petrels: These are the four species of auk-like small petrels of the southern oceans in the genus &quot;Pelacanoides&quot;.

The family Oceanitidae is the austral (or southern) storm petrels, and the family Hydrobatidae is the northern storm petrels. Collectively, they are known as the storm petrels, small pelagic petrels with a fluttering flight which often follow ships.

==In culture==
Petrels are culturally significant, and well-known poems have been written about the bird. One such example is given here.

<doc id="224416" wikidata="Q50184" url="?curid=224416" title="Yi Sun-sin">
<text>Yi Sun-sin (; ; April 28, 1545 – December 16, 1598) was a Korean admiral and military general known for his victories against the Japanese navy during the Imjin War in the Joseon period. Yi&#x27;s courtesy name was Yŏhae, and he was posthumously honored with the title Lord of Loyal Valor ().

The exact number of naval engagements conducted by Admiral Yi against the Japanese is a subject of historical debate. However, it is generally accepted that he fought in at least 23 naval battles, achieving victory in all. In many of these engagements, he commanded forces that were outnumbered and poorly supplied. His most dramatic success occurred in the Battle of Myeongnyang, where he led a Korean fleet of 13 ships to victory against a Japanese fleet of at least 133. Yi died from a gunshot wound in the Battle of Noryang, the last major battle of the Imjin War, on December 16, 1598.

Yi is considered one of history&#x27;s greatest naval commanders, known for his strategic vision, intelligence, innovations, and personality (see military evaluation). He is a prominent figure in Korean history, with landmarks, awards, and towns named after him, as well as numerous films and documentaries about his achievements. His wartime journals, known as the &quot;Nanjung Ilgi&quot;, are part of UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World initiative.

==Early life==
Yi Sun-sin was born in Geoncheon-dong (), Hanseong (present-day Inhyeon-dong, Jung District, Seoul) to Yi Chŏng () and a lady of the Ch&#x27;ogye Pyŏn clan. His family belonged to the Deoksu Yi clan. His grandfather, Yi Paengnok (이백록; 李百祿), had entered government service but was later impeached during the Gimyo literati purge. Yi&#x27;s father, Yi Chŏng, did not pursue a government career, despite the expectations placed on a yangban family.

As a child, Yi enjoyed playing war games and was always chosen as the leader. He carried a bow and arrows and would pretend to shoot at anyone, even adults, if he thought they acted unfairly. This made the villagers fear him, and they avoided passing by his house. According to &quot;Chungmugonghaengjang&quot; (), a biography believed to have been published during King Sunjo&#x27;s reign, Yi moved to Asan before the age of eight, where his future wife&#x27;s family resided.

Despite Yi&#x27;s prominent family background, Yi was largely left to navigate his own career path, because both his grandfather and father had failed to establish themselves in government. Instead of familial support, Yi relied on Yu Sŏngnyonga prominent scholar-official who later served as Chief State Councilor and oversaw military affairs during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)to endorse and propel him to high military posts within the royal court. Yi and Yu were neighbors in Geoncheon-dong and acquainted with one another. One record suggests that Yi and Yu met for the first time when Yi was 22 and Yu was 25, indicating Yi had returned from Asan to Seoul by then.

==Military career==
In 1576, Yi passed the military examination (). He is said to have impressed the judges with his archery, but failed to pass the test when he broke a leg during the cavalry section. After he re-entered and passed the examination, he was posted to the &quot;Bukbyeong&quot; (Northern Frontier Army) military district in Hamgyeong province. However, he was the oldest junior officer at the age of thirty-two. There, Yi experienced battles defending the border settlements against the Jurchen marauders and quickly became known for his strategic skills and leadership.

In 1583, he lured the Jurchen into battle, defeated the marauders, and captured their chief, Mu Pai Nai. According to a contemporary tradition, Yi then spent three years out of the army upon hearing of his father&#x27;s death. After his return to the front line, Yi led a string of successful campaigns against the Jurchen.

However, his brilliance and accomplishments so soon in his career made his superiors jealous, and they falsely accused him of desertion during battle. The conspiracy was led by General Yi Il, who would later fail to repel the Japanese invasion at the Battle of Sangju. This tendency to sabotage and frame professional adversaries was very common in the later years of the Joseon military and government. Yi was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, and tortured. After his release, Yi was allowed to fight as an enlisted soldier. After a short period of time, however, he was appointed as the commander of the Seoul &quot;Hunryeonwon&quot; (a military training center) and was later transferred to a small county, to be its military magistrate.

Yi&#x27;s efforts in northern Korea were rewarded when he was assigned as Commander of the Jeolla Province () Left Naval District. Within the span of a few months in late 1590, he received four military appointments, in rapid succession, with each subsequent post carrying greater responsibility than the last: Commander of the Kosarijin Garrison in Pyongan Province, Commander of the Manpo Garrison, also in Pyongan Province, and the Commander of the Wando Garrison, in Jeolla province, before finally receiving the appointment as Commander of the Left Jeolla Naval District.

The royal court was in a state of confusion over the possibility of a war with Japan, now unified under the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and the unstable situation in Manchuria where a young Jurchen chieftain named Nurhaci was gathering strength. Nurhaci&#x27;s descendants would become masters of China as founders of the Qing dynasty in a few decades, after invading Korea in 1627 and 1637.

Yi assumed his new post at Yeosu on the 13th day of the 2nd lunar month of 1591 (March 13, 1591). From there, he was able to undertake a buildup of the regional navy, which was later used to confront the Japanese invasion force. He subsequently began to strengthen the province&#x27;s navy with a series of reforms, including the construction of the turtle ship.

===Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)===
Yi is remembered for his numerous victories fighting the Japanese during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), also referred to as the Imjin War. Among his twenty-three victories, the Battle of Myeongnyang and the Battle of Hansan Island are the most famous battles.

In 1592, Toyotomi Hideyoshi gave the order to invade Korea and use it as a forward base to conquer Ming China. After the Japanese attacked Busan, Yi began his naval operations from his headquarters at Yeosu. Despite never having commanded a naval battle in his life, he won the Battle of Okpo, Battle of Sacheon, and several others in quick succession. His string of victories made the Japanese generals suddenly wary of the threat at sea. Yi never lost a battle during the Imjin War.

====Four campaigns of 1592====
A Japanese invasion force landed at Busan and Dadaejin, port cities on the southern tip of Joseon. The Japanese, without meeting any naval resistance, quickly captured these ports and began a lightning march north. They reached Seoul in just nineteen days, on May 2, 1592, due to the military inefficiency of the Joseon army, especially at the Battle of Sangju and the failure to defend Joryeong Pass.

After capturing Hanseong and Pyongyang, the Japanese planned to cross the Yalu River into Chinese territory, and use the waters west of the Korean peninsula to supply the invasion. However, Yi Sun-sin was able to stay informed on all his enemy&#x27;s activities.

=====First campaign=====
Yi had never officially studied naval warfare in his limited time in the military academy, and neither he nor his subordinates had experience in naval combat before the Japanese invasion.

On the June 13, 1592, Admiral Yi and Admiral Yi Eok-gi (이억기; 李億祺; 1561–1597), the commander of the Right Jeolla navy, set sail with 24 panokseons, 15 small warships, and 46 boats (i.e. fishing boats), and arrived at the waters of Gyeongsang Province by sunset. The next day, the Jeolla fleet sailed to an arranged location where Admiral Won Gyun (원균; 元均; 1540–1597) was supposed to meet them, and met the admiral on June 15. The augmented flotilla of 91 ships then began circumnavigating the Geoje Island, bound for the Gadeok Island, but scouting vessels detected 50 Japanese vessels at the harbor of Okpo. Upon sighting the approaching Korean fleet, some of the Japanese who had been busying themselves with plundering returned to their ships and began to flee. The Korean fleet encircled the Japanese ships and finished them off with artillery bombardments. The Koreans spotted five more Japanese vessels that night, and managed to destroy four of them. The next day, the Koreans approached 13 Japanese ships at Jeokjinpo, as reported by their intelligence. In the same manner as the previous success at Okpo, the Korean fleet destroyed 11 Japanese ships – completing the Battle of Okpo without the loss of a single ship.

=====Second campaign=====
About three weeks after the Battle of Okpo, Admirals Yi and Won sailed with a total of 26 ships (23 under Admiral Yi) toward the Bay of Sacheon upon receiving an intelligence report of a Japanese presence. Admiral Yi had left behind his fishing vessels that used to make up most of his fleet in favor of his newly completed turtle ship. Admiral Yi ordered the fleet to feign withdrawal, which caused the Japanese to eagerly pursue the Korean fleet with their 12 vessels. With the Japanese ships drawn out of the safety of the harbor, the Korean navy countered, and with the turtle ship leading the charge, they successfully destroyed all 12 ships. Admiral Yi was shot by a bullet in his left shoulder, but survived.

On July 10, 1592, the Korean fleet destroyed 21 Japanese ships at the Battle of Dangpo. On July 13, they destroyed 26 Japanese warship at the Battle of Danghangpo.

=====Third campaign=====
In response to the Korean navy&#x27;s success, Toyotomi Hideyoshi recalled three admirals from land-based activities: Wakizaka Yasuharu, Kato Yoshiaki, and Kuki Yoshitaka. They were the only ones with naval responsibilities in the entire Japanese invasion force. However, the admirals arrived in Busan nine days before Hideyoshi&#x27;s order was actually issued, and assembled a squadron to counter the Korean navy. Eventually Admiral Wakizaka completed his preparations, and his eagerness to win military honor pushed him to launch an attack against the Koreans without waiting for the other admirals to finish.

The combined Korean navy of 70 ships under the commands of Admirals Yi Sun-sin and Yi Eok-gi was carrying out a search-and-destroy operation because the Japanese troops on land were advancing into Jeolla Province. Jeolla Province was the only Korean territory to be untouched by a major military action, and served as home for the three admirals and the only active Korean naval force. The admirals considered it best to destroy naval support for the Japanese to reduce the effectiveness of the enemy ground troops.

On August 13, 1592, the Korean fleet sailing from Miruk Island at Dangpo received local intelligence that a large Japanese fleet was nearby. The following morning, the Korean fleet spotted the Japanese fleet of 82 vessels anchored in the strait of Gyeonnaeryang. Because of the narrowness of the strait and the hazard posed by the underwater rocks, Admiral Yi sent six ships to lure out 63 Japanese vessels into the wider sea, and the Japanese fleet followed. There the Japanese fleet was surrounded by the Korean fleet in a semicircular formation called the &quot;crane wing&quot; () by Admiral Yi. With at least three turtle ships (two of which were newly completed) spearheading the clash, the Korean vessels fired volleys of cannonballs into the Japanese formation. Then the Korean ships engaged in a free-for-all battle with the Japanese ships, maintaining enough distance to prevent the Japanese from boarding; Admiral Yi permitted melee combat only against severely damaged Japanese ships.

The Battle of Hansan Island ended in a Korean victory, with Japanese losses of 59 ships – 47 destroyed and 12 captured. Several Korean prisoners of war were rescued during the fight. Admiral Wakisaka escaped due to the speed of his flagship. When the news of the defeat reached Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he ordered that the Japanese invasion forces cease all naval operations.

On August 16, 1592, Yi Sun-sin led the fleet to the harbor of Angolpo, where 42 Japanese vessels were docked.

=====Fourth campaign=====
In September 1592, Yi left his base at Hansan Island and attacked the Japanese in Busan harbor. Yi withdrew his forces from Busan harbor after the battle due to the absence of a landing force.

=====Aftermath of four campaigns of 1592=====
In 1593, Admiral Yi was appointed to command the combined navies of the three southern provinces with the title &quot;Naval Commander of the Three Provinces&quot; () which gave him command over the Right and Left Navies of Jeolla province, the Right and Left Navies of Gyeongsang province, and the Navy of Chungcheong province.

====Turtle Ships====
Yi designed and built a number of warships known as &quot;geobukseon&quot; (), characterized by their tortoise-like design, dragon-shaped figurehead, and iron-spiked deck. The turtle ship measured 65 feet in length, with a width of 12 feet at the bow, 10.5 feet at the stern, and 14.5 feet amidships. Each broadside featured six gun ports, each armed with a mortar, supplemented by additional mortars positioned ahead and astern. The dragon-like figurehead emitted sulfurous smoke and created a smokescreen to obscure the ship&#x27;s movements. Narrow slits between the gun ports allowed for the discharge of fire-arrows and gunfire. The roof, covered with planks and spikes, thwarted Japanese boarding tactics.

There is a continuing debate as to whether the turtle ship had two decks or three; historians still have no definitive answer. Whichever is the case, it is clear that the turtle ship employed multiple decks to separate the rowers from the combat compartment. This enabled the turtle ship to be very mobile since wind and manpower could be used simultaneously. Most support the argument of two decks since that was what was drawn out in the first and second designs of the turtle ships. Some historians maintain that, since Yi was a unique individual and often pursued innovative ideas (contrary to the established wisdom of his peers), it is possible that he had the turtle ship built with three decks. It is known that his flagship, a panokseon, had three decks during his campaigns, so there is support for the belief that the turtle ship had three decks.

Turtle ships were the most famous part of Admiral Yi&#x27;s fleet; however, he never deployed more than five in any one battle. Joseon used cannons as its primary offensive naval weapon. Historically, they had often used guns and cannons against Japanese pirates as early as the 1390s. The Joseon navy did not implement the ship-boarding strategy that the Japanese navy did, so it was imperative that their warships &quot;stand off&quot; from Japanese vessels. Admiral Yi made it a strategic priority to avoid hand-to-hand combat, in which the Japanese navy specialized. The turtle ship was developed to support his tactic against Japanese fleets.

Turtle ships were first used in the 1592 Battle of Sacheon and were used in nearly every battle until the devastating Battle of Chilchonryang, when a Japanese double-agent plot nearly succeeded, resulting in every turtle ship and all but 13 panokseon being sunk. The turtle ships did not re-appear in battle until the Battle of Noryang.

Turtle ships were mostly used to spearhead attacks. They were best used in tight areas and around islands rather than the open sea.

==== Dismissal of Yi Sun-sin ====
One day, he told General Kim Gyeong-seo that the Japanese general Katō Kiyomasa would be coming on a certain date with a great fleet for another attack on the south shores and insisted that Admiral Yi be sent to lay an ambush. General Kim agreed and sent the message to Field Marshal Gwon Yul (권율; 權慄; 1537–1599), Commander-in-Chief () of the Joseon military, who, in turn, sent the message to King Seonjo. King Seonjo, who was desperate for victories to loosen the Japanese grip on his kingdom, gave permission for the attack. When General Kim gave Admiral Yi his orders, the admiral refused to carry them out, for he knew that the location given was studded with sunken rocks and was thus extremely dangerous. Admiral Yi also refused because he did not trust the words.

When General Kim informed the king of Admiral Yi&#x27;s refusal, the admiral&#x27;s enemies at court quickly insisted on his replacement by General Won Gyun, former commander of the Gyeongsang Province Western Fleet &amp; Commander of the Jeolla Province Ground Forces. They advised that Admiral Yi be arrested.

As a result, in 1597, Yi was relieved of command, placed under arrest, and taken to Seoul in chains to be imprisoned and tortured. Yi was tortured almost to the point of death by using simple torture tactics such as whipping, flogging, burning, the cudgel, or even the classic technique of leg breaking torture. King Seonjo wanted to have Yi killed, but the admiral&#x27;s supporters at court, chiefly the minister Jeong Tak (정탁; 鄭琢; 1526–1605), convinced the king to spare him due to his past service record. The prime minister, Yu Sŏngnyong, who was Yi&#x27;s childhood friend and his main supporter, remained silent during this deadly hour. Spared the death penalty, Admiral Yi was again demoted to the rank of a common infantry soldier under General Gwon Yul. This penalty was worse than death for Joseon generals at that time, since they lived by honor. However, Yi responded to this humiliation as a most obedient subject, quietly going about his work as if his rank and orders were appropriate. Despite his low rank, many officers treated him with respect, since they knew that the admiral did nothing wrong. Yi would stay under General Gwon Yul&#x27;s command for a short while until Won Gyun&#x27;s death at the Battle of Chilchonryang, which would lead to his reinstatement.

====Joseon defeat at Chilchonryang and reinstatement of Admiral Yi====
With Yi stripped of influence and negotiations breaking down in 1596, Hideyoshi again ordered an attack on Joseon. The second Japanese invasion landed in the first month of 1597 with a force of 140,000 men transported on 1000 ships. In response, Ming China sent thousands of reinforcements to aid Joseon. With the help of the Ming, the Joseon army was able to halt the Japanese offensive and push it back during the winter of 1597, before the Japanese were able to reach the Joseon capitol of Hanseong.

On the high seas, Yi&#x27;s successor Won Gyun failed to respond to reports from his scouts and allowed the Japanese to land critical reinforcements at Sosang Harbor for their land offensive unopposed. Without adequate reconnaissance or planning, Won Gyun decided to attack with the entire naval force of Joseon at his disposal – a fleet consisting of 150 warships operated by 30,000 men that had been carefully assembled and trained by Admiral Yi. Won Gyun left anchor at Yeosu with the fleet and sailed into waters marked by treacherous rocks. The Japanese ambushed the Joseon fleet in the Battle of Chilchonryang on August 28, 1597. Ignorant of the strength and disposition of the enemy, Won was stunned to find a Japanese fleet of 500 to 1000 ships which immediately closed for melee combat, denying the Joseon ships the advantages of superior seamanship and cannon fire. The exhausted Joseon sailors were reduced to fighting boarding actions while heavily outnumbered and were slaughtered &quot;en masse&quot;.

The Joseon fleet was decimated with only 13 warships surviving under Admiral Bae Seol, who fled before battle was fully engaged to save the warships under his command. After the destruction of the Joseon fleet, Won Gyun and Yi Eok-gi, another Joseon commander, fled to an island with a band of survivors but were killed by waiting Japanese soldiers from the nearby fort. When King Seonjo and the royal court learned of the catastrophic defeat, they hurriedly pardoned and reinstated Admiral Yi as commander of the greatly reduced Joseon fleet.

====Battle of Myeongnyang====
Admiral Yi located the 13 warships and rallied the 200 surviving sailors. Together with his flagship, Admiral Yi&#x27;s entire fleet totaled 13 ships, none of which were turtle ships. In the belief that the Joseon fleet would never be restorable, King Seonjo, sent an edict to Admiral Yi to abandon the warships and take his men to join the ground forces under General Gwon Yul. Admiral Yi responded with a letter written &quot;...your servant still doth have twelve warships under his command and he is still alive, that the enemy shall never be safe in the West Sea&quot; (the Yellow Sea being the closest body of water to Hanseong).

Emboldened after their victory at Chilchonryang, Japanese admirals Kurushima Michifusa, Todo Takatora, Kato Yoshiaki, and Wakisaka Yasuharu sailed out of Busan Harbor with a fleet of over 300 ships, confident that they would defeat Admiral Yi. Elimination of the Joseon fleet would mean unrestricted movement of supplies and reinforcements from Japan for the land offensive towards Hanseong and beyond.

After careful study of potential battlefields, in October 1597 Admiral Yi lured the Japanese fleet into the Myeongnyang Strait, by sending a fast warship near the Japanese naval base and luring the Japanese fleet out of anchorage. The Japanese assumed that this was a Joseon scouting ship and that pursuing it would lead to the location of Admiral Yi, giving them an opportunity to destroy the remnants of the Joseon fleet. What they did not know was that they were being lured into a masterfully devised trap.

There were several reasons why Admiral Yi decided on this location for battle. Myeongnyang Strait had currents, eddies, and whirlpools so powerful that ships could only enter safely a few at a time. The north–south tidal flow reversed every three hours, limiting the time that the Japanese could mount an offensive. The strait was sufficiently narrow that it would prove impossible for the Japanese to flank or envelop the numerically inferior Joseon fleet. The deep shadows of the surrounding hillsides provided the Joseon ships with concealment. On that particular day there was also a heavy mist, dramatically reducing visibility in favor of the Joseon fleet. Therefore, despite being vastly outnumbered, Admiral Yi used the terrain restrictions to neutralize the Japanese navy&#x27;s staggering numerical advantage.

The Japanese fleet of approximately 333 ships (133 warships, at least 200 logistical support ships) entered Myeongnyang Strait in groups. The Japanese ships that made it through were met by 13 Joseon warships obscured by the shadows of the surrounding hills, ready with archers and cannons, and the melee-based Japanese found themselves unable to fight effectively and break through the superior Joseon ranged fire. The unpredictable current eventually wreaked havoc on the Japanese; their ships found themselves unable to maneuver and collided with each other when the tide reversed, while also presenting a perfect target for the Joseon naval artillery. Admiral Yi was astonishingly able to rout a force that outnumbered him more than 25 to 1 in ships alone. About 31 of the 333 Japanese ships that entered the Myeongnyang Strait were destroyed or damaged. Joseon losses on the other hand were around ten casualties and no ships lost. Kurushima Michifusa was killed on his flagship by Joseon archers; his body in its ornate armor was fished out of the water and his severed head was put on display to further demoralize the Japanese fleet.

====Final battle and Admiral Yi&#x27;s death====


On December 15, 1598, a huge Japanese fleet under the command of Shimazu Yoshihiro, was amassed in Sachon Bay, on the east end of Noryang Strait. Shimazu&#x27;s goal was to break the allied forces&#x27; blockade on Konishi Yukinaga, join the two fleets, and sail home to Japan. Admiral Yi, meanwhile, knew exactly where Shimazu was, after receiving reports from scouts and local fishermen.

At this time, the Joseon fleet consisted of 82 panokseon and three turtle ships, with 8,000 soldiers under Admiral Yi. The Ming fleet consisted of six large war junks, 57 lighter war galleys and two panokseon given to Chen Lin by Admiral Yi, with 5,000 Ming soldiers of the Guangdong squadron and 2,600 Ming marines who fought aboard Joseon ships.

The battle began at two o&#x27;clock in the early morning of December 16, 1598. Like Admiral Yi&#x27;s previous battles, the Japanese were unable to respond effectively to the Korean&#x27;s tactics. The tightness of Noryang Strait hindered lateral movement, and Yi&#x27;s maneuvers prevented the Japanese fleet from boarding their enemies&#x27; vessels, their primary naval tactic.

As the Japanese retreated, Admiral Yi ordered a vigorous pursuit. During this time, a stray arquebus bullet from an enemy ship struck Admiral Yi, near his left armpit. Sensing that the wound was fatal, and fearing a repeat of the Battle of Chilchonryang, the admiral uttered, &quot;The war is at its height – wear my armor and beat my war drums. Do not announce my death.&quot; He died moments later.

Only two people witnessed his death: Yi Hoe, Yi&#x27;s eldest son, and Yi Wan, his nephew. Admiral Yi&#x27;s son and nephew struggled to regain their composure and carried the admiral&#x27;s body into his cabin before others could notice. For the remainder of the battle, Yi Wan wore his uncle&#x27;s armor and continued to beat the war drum to encourage the pursuit.

Yi&#x27;s tomb is currently located in Asan, South Korea.

==== Comrade Chen Lin ====
During the battle, Chen Lin and Yi were friends and allies who helped and rescued each other several times. When Chen Lin called for Admiral Yi to thank him for coming to his aid, he was met by Yi Wan, who announced that his uncle was dead. It is said that Chen himself was so shocked that he fell to the ground three times, beating his chest and crying. News of Admiral Yi&#x27;s death spread quickly throughout the allied fleet and both Joseon and Ming sailors and fighting men wailed in grief. Chen Lin later reported the news of Yi&#x27;s death to Wanli Emperor, where he bestowed gifts and eulogies on Chen and Yi. Since then, Yi and Chen were memorialized as national heroes in Korea. Chen&#x27;s descendants were later welcomed back to Korea to start the Gwangdong Jin clan, because of Chen Lin&#x27;s contributions in defeating the Japanese and his camaraderie with Yi Sunsin.

Admiral Yi&#x27;s body was brought back to his hometown in Asan to be buried next to his father, Yi Jeong (in accordance to Korean tradition). Shrines, both official and unofficial, were constructed in his honor all throughout the land.&quot;

==Legacy==
=== Military evaluation ===
Some say Yi is an exemplar of conduct for both Koreans and even Japanese.

Yi is often regarded as one of history&#x27;s greatest naval leaders. Some military historians like Joseph Cummins and George Alexander Ballard place Yi on par with Admiral Horatio Nelson. According to Ballard: It is always difficult for Englishmen to admit that Nelson ever had an equal in his profession, but if any man is entitled to be so regarded, it should be this great naval commander of Asiatic race who never knew defeat and died in the presence of the enemy; of whose movements a track-chart might be compiled from the wrecks of hundreds of Japanese ships lying with their valiant crews at the bottom of the sea, off the coasts of the Korean peninsula... and it seems, in truth, no exaggeration to assert that from first to last he never made a mistake, for his work was so complete under each variety of circumstances as to defy criticism... His whole career might be summarized by saying that, although he had no lessons from history to serve as a guide, he waged war on the sea as it should be waged if it is to produce definite results, and ended by making the supreme sacrifice of a defender of his country. (&quot;The Influence of the Sea on The Political History of Japan&quot;, pp. 66–67.)

Admiral Togo regarded Admiral Yi as his superior. At a party held in his honor, Togo took exception to a speech comparing him to Lord Nelson and Yi Sun-sin.

It may be proper to compare me with Nelson, but not with Korea&#x27;s Yi Sun-sin, for he has no equal. (&quot;The Imjin War&quot;, by Samuel Hawley, pg. 490)

Prior to the 1905 Battle of Tsushima, Lieutenant Commander Kawada Isao recalled in his memoirs that:

...naturally we could not help but remind ourselves of Korea&#x27;s Yi Sun-sin, the world&#x27;s first sea commander, whose superlative personality, strategy, invention, commanding ability, intelligence, and courage were all worthy of our admiration. (&quot;The Imjin War&quot;, by Samuel Hawley, pg. 490)

Admiral Tetsutaro Sato of the Imperial Japanese Navy mentioned the Korean admiral in his book published in 1908:
Throughout history there have been few generals accomplished at the tactics of frontal attack, sudden attack, concentration and dilation. Napoleon, who mastered the art of conquering the part with the whole, can be held to have been such a general, and among admirals, two further tactical geniuses may be named: in the East, Yi Sun-sin of Korea, and in the West, Horatio Nelson of England. Undoubtedly, Yi is a supreme naval commander even on the basis of the limited literature of the Seven-Year War, and despite the fact that his bravery and brilliance are not known to the West, since he had the misfortune to be born in Joseon period. Anyone who can be compared to Yi should be better than Michiel de Ruyter from Netherlands. Nelson is far behind Yi in terms of personal character and integrity. Yi was the inventor of the covered warship known as the turtle ship. He was a truly great commander and a master of the naval tactics of three hundred years ago. – &quot;A Military History of the Empire&quot; (Japanese: 帝國國防史論), p. 399

===Titles and honors===

Although the Korean royal court often ignored his successes during his life, after his death various honors were bestowed upon him, including the title of &quot;Chungmugong&quot; (충무공; 忠武公; Duke of Loyalty and Warfare), an enrollment as a &quot;Seonmu Ildeung Gongsin&quot; (선무일등공신; 宣武一等功臣; First-class military order of merit during the reign of Seonjo), and two posthumous offices, &quot;Yeonguijeong&quot; (영의정; 領議政; Prime Minister), and the &quot;Deokpung Buwongun&quot; (덕풍부원군; 德豊府院君; The Prince of the Court from Deokpung). His title of &quot;&quot;), , was the title used for the commander of the Korean navy until 1896.
Admiral Yi&#x27;s posthumous title, &quot;Chungmugong&quot;, is used as South Korea&#x27;s third highest military honor, known as &quot;The Cordon of Chungmu of the Order of Military Merit and Valor&quot;. He was posthumously granted the title of &quot;Prince of Deokpung&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In North Korea, the military awards the Order of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin () to flag officers and naval commanders for outstanding leadership.

=== Relics ===

Janggeom () is a pair of Japanese sword made by Japanese swordsmith captured by Yi Sun-sin. Those were designated as Treasure No. 326-1 in 1963 and promoted to a National Treasure of South Korea on August 24, 2023. Those are currently on display at . The reason why the swords were created was Yi Sun-sin captured Japanese swordsmiths during the Imjin War and had them make two swords to confirm their claim that they were swordsmiths.

Janggeom have great historical value because those have a convergent international design. The swords&#x27; material are closer to that of Hwando than Katana, but since those are about 2m long, it resembles Odachi and very different from the Hwando, which rarely have a blade length greater than 1.5m. The guard and handle decoration are in the style of a Katana, and the fishtail-shaped hilt is in the Ming dynasty style. After the sword was completed, Yi Sun-sin inscribed his own poem on the each sword&#x27;s blade.

==Public reception and fame==
===Joseon government===
Admiral Yi repeatedly defeated the Japanese invasion force in battle, while preserving the lives of his soldiers and respecting their families. Yi was supported by the people of Joseon not only for his victories, but his kindness and gratitude towards those affected by the hardships of war. They had great faith in Admiral Yi and he was regarded as more than just an admiral.

By contrast, King Seonjo accomplished nothing. The Joseon period&#x27;s king had failed to defend the kingdom and his cowardly flight to Uiju left his reputation in ruins. The Joseon government was plagued by factionalism driven by jealousy; the ministers despised the successful and virtuous admiral, and manipulated King Seonjo to view Admiral Yi as a potential traitor. It is plausible to believe that King Seonjo and his court truly feared Admiral Yi&#x27;s victories and reputation amongst the people as the foundations for a revolt leading King Seonjo to have him arrested and tortured. Defended by his loyal friend, Prime Minister Yu Sŏngnyong, Admiral Yi was spared execution twice. The conspiracies worked against Admiral Yi from gaining the men, materiel, and operational freedom to decisively destroy the Japanese invasion force.

It should also be noted that according to a recent &quot;Choson Ilbo&quot; article, historians have discovered written government records of the Joseon government&#x27;s reaction to Admiral Yi&#x27;s death. The records show that King Seonjo expressed a &quot;blank expression&quot;, offering no signs of sadness or shock. Nearly all awards to Admiral Yi and his deeds were awarded posthumously.

===In South Korea===
Yi is widely renowned in modern-day South Korea as the greatest general in Korean history. In a 2019 poll by Gallup Korea, Yi Sun-sin was chosen as the most respected person among South Koreans, winning 14% of the vote. Sejong the Great came in second with 11% of all votes.

Prominent statues of Admiral Yi have been erected in the middle of Sejongno in central Seoul (the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin) and at Busan Tower in Busan. The city of Chungmu on the southern coast of Korea, now renamed Tongyeong, is named in honor of his posthumous title and the site of his headquarters. Additionally, a street in downtown Seoul is named after him, and the Yi Sun-sin Bridge was built near Yeosu and opened to traffic on May 10, 2012, becoming the longest suspension bridge in Korea.

South Korea&#x27;s KDX-II naval destroyer class, and the first commissioned ship of the class, are named &quot;Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin&quot;.

A shrine dedicated to Yi now stands in Asan, where he spent his adolescence years.

An ITF-style Taekwondo pattern is named after Yi&#x27;s posthumous name of Chungmu.

A depiction of Admiral Yi is featured on the front of the 100 South Korean won coin.

===In North Korea===
In modern-day North Korea, Yi is honored as a patriot and a hero just like the South. However, as Yi was born into a &quot;yangban&quot; family, his actions are attributed to Joseon and its class systems. Thus, compared to the South, his legacy is relatively depreciated as a struggle to protect the &quot;feudalist throne&quot; and the &quot;yangban&quot; landlord class.

==Cultural depictions==
===Film and television===
Yi&#x27;s life has been depicted in two motion pictures entitled &quot;Seong-ung Yi Sun-sin&quot; (&quot;The Saintly Hero Yi Sun-sin&quot;). The first is a 1962 black-and-white movie, and the second, based upon his war diaries, was made in color in 1971.

A 2005 Korean film, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Soldiers&quot; directed by Min Joon-ki, portrayed a young Yi Sun-sin fighting the Jurchen tribes, along with local villagers and North and South Korean soldiers who traveled in time, from 2005 to 1572, with Halley&#x27;s Comet. Unusually, the film presented Yi as a cunning, slightly eccentric young man, rather than a distinguished austere hero, a couple of decades before Imjin war. Some historical events were also distorted: most notably Yi&#x27;s campaign against the Jurchens, which did not happen in 1572 but a few years later, after his 1576 military examination. The film, financed with a comfortable budget by Korean standards ($7–8 million), was a relative commercial success in 2005. The film&#x27;s theme clearly uses the figure of Yi, venerated as a hero in both parts of present-day Korea, to plead for Korean reunification.

From September 4, 2004, to August 28, 2005, a 104-episode drama series was aired on KBS. The show, titled &quot;Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin&quot;, dealt mostly with the events related to the Japanese invasions of Korea, as well as the life of the admiral. It became a popular drama in China and was re-aired in certain ethnic channels in the United States as well. The drama was criticized for the many artistic licenses taken, such as depicting Yi as weak and lonely in his early life and taking liberties with the events surrounding his death. On the other hand, many people complimented the way the drama portrayed him with a more human touch. It described the admiral as a true man who had to overcome many dangers and difficulties quite frequently alone, not just a hero among the clouds. This drama was a heated topic at the time since it overlapped with rising tensions in the ongoing Liancourt Rocks dispute; the series further strained relations between South Korea and Japan in the issue&#x27;s most recent outbreak.

Film director Kim Han-min created a film trilogy about battles led by Yi Sun-sin. The first film, &quot;The Admiral: Roaring Currents&quot; (2014) revolves around the events of the Battle of Myeongnyang and it became the most-watched film in South Korean history, attracting 17 million movie-goers. The second film &quot;&quot; (2022), is based on the Battle of Hansan Island. The third film &quot;&quot; (2023), depicts the Battle of Noryang.

In his book, the journalist-turned-novelist describes that Yi deliberately stood at the front of his ship in his final battle making himself a target for Japanese gunmen, thinking that ending his life in this honorable fashion could be better than facing another political ploys which was likely to wait him in the Joseon royal court after the war.

<doc id="224423" wikidata="Q2519998" url="?curid=224423" title="Secretary of State for the Colonies">
<text>The secretary of state for the colonies or colonial secretary was the Cabinet of the United Kingdom&#x27;s minister in charge of managing certain parts of the British Empire.

The colonial secretary never had responsibility for the provinces and princely states of India, which had its own secretary of state.

From 1768 until 1966, the secretary of state was supported by an under-secretary of state for the colonies (at times an under-secretary of state for war and the colonies), and latterly by a minister of state.

==History==

Colonial responsibilities were previously held jointly by the lords of trade and plantations (board) and the secretary of state for the Southern Department, 
who was responsible for Ireland, the American colonies, and relations with the Catholic and Muslim states of Europe, as well as being jointly responsible for domestic affairs with the Secretary of State for the Northern Department.

===Colonial Secretary 1768–1782===
The Colonial Secretary position was first created in 1768 to deal with the increasingly troublesome North American colonies, following passage of the Townsend Acts. 
Joint responsibility between the secretary and board first continued at this time, but subsequent diminution of the board&#x27;s status led it to became an adjunct to the new secretary&#x27;s department.

Following the loss of the American colonies, both the board and the short-lived secretaryship were dismissed by the king on 2 May 1782; both were abolished later by the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 (22 Geo. 3, c 82). 
Following this, colonial duties were given to the Home Secretary, then Lord Sydney.

===1782–1854===

Responsibility for the Colonies in the years between 1782 and 1854 included&quot;:&quot;
* Home Secretary &quot;1782–1801&quot;
* Secretary of State for War and the Colonies &quot;1801–1854&quot;
* Secretary of State for the Colonies &quot;from 1854&quot;

Following the Treaty of Paris 1783, a new board, named the Committee of Council on Trade and Plantations (later known as &#x27;the First Committee&#x27;) was established under William Pitt the Younger, by an Order in Council in 1784. In 1794, a new office was created for Henry Dundas – the secretary of state for war, which now took responsibility for the Colonies. The office was renamed the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1801.

===1854–present===
In 1854, military reforms led to the colonial and military responsibilities of this secretary of state being split into two separate offices, with Sir George Grey becoming the first secretary of state for the colonies under the new arrangement.

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Britain gained control over a number of territories with the status of &quot;protectorate&quot;. The ministerial responsibility for these territories was initially held by the Foreign Secretary.
By the early years of the twentieth century the responsibility for each of the protectorate territories had been transferred to the colonial secretary as well. The League of Nations mandated territories acquired as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 became a further responsibility of the Colonial Office in the aftermath of the First World War.

In 1925, part of the Colonial Office was separated out as the Dominions Office, with its own secretary of state. The new office was responsible for dealing with the Dominions together with a small number of other territories (most notably Southern Rhodesia).

In the twenty years following the end of the Second World War, much of the British Empire was dismantled as its various territories gained independence. In consequence, the Colonial Office was merged in 1966 with the Commonwealth Relations Office (which until 1947 had been the Dominions Office) to form the Commonwealth Office, while ministerial responsibility was transferred to the secretary of state for Commonwealth affairs (previously known as the secretary of state for Commonwealth relations). In 1968, the Commonwealth Office was subsumed into the Foreign Office, which was renamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

==List of secretaries of state for the colonies==

===Secretaries of State for the Colonies (1768–1782)===

Sometimes referred to as Secretary of State for the American Colonies.

Office abolished in 1782 after the loss of the American Colonies.

===Secretaries of State for the Colonies (1854–1966)===

Responsibility for the colonies held by:
* Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs 1966–1968
* Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs 1968–present
Following the British Nationality Act 1981, the term &quot;colony&quot; ceased to be used; Britain&#x27;s rule over Hong Kong, the last significant colony, ceased in 1997. Britain retains certain overseas territories.

;Notes:
==Secretaries from the Colonies==

A few title holders were born in colonies under their portfolio and some beyond:

* Bonar Law – born in pre-Canada colony of New Brunswick and later moved to the United Kingdom
* Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin – born in Canada during his father&#x27;s, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, term as Governor General of Canada and a British appointee
* Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner – born in Grand Duchy of Hesse (now in Germany) to Charles Milner (who had English roots from his father)

<text>David Hunter (July 21, 1802 – February 2, 1886) was an American military officer. He served as a Union general during the American Civil War. He achieved notability for his unauthorized 1862 order (immediately rescinded) emancipating slaves in three Southern states, for his leadership of United States troops during the Valley Campaigns of 1864, and as the president of the military commission trying the conspirators involved with the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.

==Early life and education==
Hunter (son of Andrew Hunter and Mary Stockton) was born in Troy, New York, or Princeton, New Jersey. He was the cousin of writer-illustrator David Hunter Strother (who would also serve as a Union Army general). His maternal grandfather was Richard Stockton, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. 

After graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1822, Hunter was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment. Records of his military service prior to the Civil War contain significant gaps. From 1828 to 1831, he was stationed on the northwest frontier, at Fort Dearborn (Chicago). There he met and married Maria Kinzie, a daughter of John Kinzie, considered the city&#x27;s first permanent white resident. He served in the infantry for 11 years, and was promoted to captain of the 1st U.S. Dragoons in 1833. 

He resigned from the army in July 1836 and moved to Illinois, where he worked as a real estate agent or speculator. He rejoined the Army in November 1841 as a paymaster and was promoted to major in March 1842. One source claims that he saw action in the Second Seminole War (1838–42) and the Mexican–American War (1846–48).

In 1860, Hunter was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began a correspondence with Abraham Lincoln, emphasizing his own strong anti-slavery views. This relationship engendered political influence: after winning election to the presidency, Lincoln invited Hunter to ride on his inaugural train in February 1861 from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington, D.C. During this duty, Hunter suffered a dislocated collarbone at Buffalo due to the crowd pressing the president-elect.

==Career==

===American Civil War===
Soon after the firing on Fort Sumter, Hunter was promoted to colonel of the 6th U.S. Cavalry. Three days later, May 17, 1861, his political connection to the Lincoln administration resulted in his being appointed as the fourth-ranking brigadier general of volunteers, commanding a brigade in the Department of Washington. He was wounded in the neck and cheek while commanding a division under Irvin McDowell at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. In August, he was promoted to major general of volunteers. 

He served as a division commander in the Western Army under Major General John C. Frémont, and was appointed as commander of the Western Department on November 2, 1861, after Frémont was relieved of command due to his attempt to emancipate the slaves of rebellious slave holders. Hunter did not last long in this position, and within two months was reassigned to the Department of Kansas, a post where there was little chance of getting into trouble. He did not accept his exile gracefully and wrote a series of fulminating protest letters to the president, who finally gave in to his complaints. In March 1862, Hunter was transferred again to command the Department of the South and the X Corps. 

Hunter served as president of the court-martial of Major General Fitz John Porter. (He was convicted for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run, but was exonerated by an 1878 Board of Officers.) He also was assigned to the committee that investigated the loss of Harpers Ferry in the Maryland Campaign. He served briefly as the assistant inspector general of the Department of the Gulf.

====General Orders No. 7 and 11====

After the Battle of Fort Pulaski in April 1862, when Hunter&#x27;s troops bombarded and reclaimed the Confederate-held fort at the mouth of the Savannah River, Hunter issued General Orders 7 and 11. General Orders 7, issued on April 13, freed slaves in the fort and on Cockspur Island. Following the success of this order, Hunter hoped to further his abolitionist cause beyond the confines of this small Georgia island. 

Hunter was also a strong advocate of arming black men as soldiers for the Union cause. He planned to form multiple segregated regiments but first needed to grow his recruitment pool. In May 1862, Hunter caused controversy by issuing General Orders 11, an order emancipating slaves in the states of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida:

President Abraham Lincoln quickly rescinded this order, because he was concerned about its political effects in the border states, which he was trying to keep neutral. Their leaders advocated instead a gradual emancipation with compensation for enslavers. Despite Lincoln&#x27;s concerns that immediate emancipation in the South might drive some slave-holding Unionists to support the Confederacy, the national mood was quickly moving against slavery, especially within the Army. 

The president and Congress had already enacted several laws during the war to severely restrict the institution, beginning with the First Confiscation Act in August 1861 and culminating in Lincoln&#x27;s own Emancipation Proclamation issued in September 1862, and to take effect January 1, 1863. Concerned Confederate slaveholders had worried since before the war started that its eventual goal would become the abolition of slavery and they reacted strongly to the Union effort to emancipate Confederate slaves. Confederate President Jefferson Davis issued orders to the Confederate army that Hunter was to be considered a &quot;felon to be executed if captured&quot;.

====Controversy over enlistment of ex-slaves====
Undeterred by the president&#x27;s reluctance and intent on extending freedom to potential black soldiers, Hunter again flouted orders from the federal government. He enlisted ex-slaves as soldiers from occupied districts in South Carolina without permission from the War Department. He formed the first such Union Army regiment, the 1st South Carolina (African Descent). He was initially ordered to disband it, but eventually got approval from Congress for his action. This action incensed pro-slavery border state politicians, and Representative Charles A. Wickliffe (D-KY) sponsored a resolution demanding a response.

Hunter sent a defiant letter on June 23, 1862, to Congress, reminding them of his authority as a commanding officer in a war zone:

While the increasingly abolitionist Republicans in Congress were amused by the order, border state pro-slavery politicians, such as Wickliffe and Robert Mallory (D), were not. Mallory described the scene in Congress following the reading of the order as follows:

The War Department eventually forced Hunter to abandon this scheme, but the government nonetheless soon took action to expand the enlistment of black men as military laborers. Congress approved the Confiscation Act of 1862, which effectively freed all blacks working within the armed forces by forbidding Union soldiers to aid in the return of fugitive slaves.

In 1863, Hunter wrote a letter to Confederate President Jefferson Davis protesting against the Confederate army&#x27;s brutal mistreatment of captured black U.S. soldiers. He attacked the Confederates&#x27; claims to be fighting for freedom, listing the abuses they committed against human beings under slavery :

====The Valley and &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;====
In the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Union Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel was ordered by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to move into the Shenandoah Valley, threaten railroads and the agricultural economy there, and distract Robert E. Lee while Grant fought him in eastern Virginia. Sigel did a poor job, losing immediately at the Battle of New Market to a force that included cadets from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). Hunter replaced Sigel in command of the Army of the Shenandoah and the Department of West Virginia on May 21, 1864. Grant ordered Hunter to employ scorched earth tactics similar to those that would be used later in that year during Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea; he was to move through Staunton to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, &quot;living off the country&quot; and destroying the Virginia Central Railroad &quot;beyond possibility of repair for weeks.&quot; Lee was concerned enough about Hunter that he dispatched a corps under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early to deal with him.
On June 5, Hunter defeated Maj. Gen. William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones at the Battle of Piedmont. Following orders, he moved up the Valley (southward) through Staunton to Lexington, destroying military targets and other industries (such as blacksmiths and stables) that could be used to support the Confederacy. After reaching Lexington, his troops burned down VMI on June 11 in retaliation of that institution sending cadets to fight at New Market. Hunter ordered the home of former governor John Letcher burned in retaliation for its absent owner&#x27;s having issued &quot;a violent and inflammatory proclamation ... inciting the population of the country to rise and wage guerrilla warfare on my troops.&quot; Hunter also wreaked havoc on Washington College in Lexington, later Washington and Lee University. According to Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s biography of his uncle, Robert E. Lee, &quot;[Hunter] had no respect for colleges, or the peaceful pursuits of professors and students, or the private dwellings of citizens, though occupied by women and children only, and during his three days occupancy of Lexington in June, 1864, the college buildings were dismantled, apparatus destroyed, and the books mutilated.&quot;

Hunter&#x27;s campaign in the Valley came to an end after he was defeated by Early at the Battle of Lynchburg on June 19. His headquarters was at Sandusky House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and now operated as a house museum. After the battle, Hunter retreated across the Allegheny Mountains into West Virginia, thereby taking his army out of the war altogether for a few weeks and allowing Early a free rein in the Valley. Though this retreat was widely criticized, Ulysses Grant in his Memoirs excused it as follows: &quot;General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to give battle, retired from before the place. Unfortunately, this want of ammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up the Ohio River, returning to Harper&#x27;s Ferry by way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.&quot; Hunter would maintain until his dying day that it had been a strategically sound move and he wrote a series of persistent letters to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and President Lincoln arguing that the retreat was entirely justified. He badgered Grant with letters a few months later arguing that the army and officers he inherited from Franz Sigel were below average, and that he had never been told that he had any assignment to defend Washington, D.C. After the war, he wrote a letter to Robert E. Lee asking if he as a fellow soldier did not agree with the soundness of the retreat. Lee, who had a loathing of Hunter, wrote back that he had no clue what the exact strategic value of retreating into West Virginia was, but that it had been extremely helpful to himself and the Confederate cause.

The burning of the Virginia Military Institute by Hunter also angered the Confederates and made them more vengeful than before. After retaking possession of the Valley, Early described the scene as &quot;truly heart-rending. Houses had been burned, and helpless women and children left without shelter. The country had been stripped of provisions and many families left without a morsel to eat. Furniture and bedding had been cut to pieces, and old men and women and children robbed of all the clothing they had except that on their backs. Ladies trunks had been rifled and their dresses torn to pieces in mere wantonness. Even the negro girls had lost their little finery. . . At Lexington he had burned the Military Institute, with all of its contents, including its library and scientific apparatus; and Washington College had been plundered and the statue of George Washington stolen. The residence of Ex-Governor Letcher at that place had been burned by orders, and but a few minutes given Mrs. Letcher and her family to leave the house. . . [A] Mr. Creigh, had been hung, because, on a former occasion, he had killed a straggling and marauding Federal soldier while in the act of insulting and outraging the ladies of his family.&quot; The Confederate raids into Maryland and Pennsylvania in July were accompanied by widespread looting and destruction.

On August 1, Grant placed Maj. Gen Philip Sheridan in command of the effort to destroy Jubal Early&#x27;s army. The Shenandoah, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., area all fell under Hunter&#x27;s military department, but Grant had no intention of allowing Hunter any direct command over the campaign against Early. He therefore informed him that he could retain department command on paper while Sheridan did the active field campaigning. Hunter however declined this offer, stating that he had been so beset by contradictory War Department orders that he had no idea where Jubal Early&#x27;s army even was, and he would rather just turn everything over to Sheridan. Grant immediately accepted and relieved Hunter of his post. He would serve in no more combat commands. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army on March 13, 1865, an honor that was relatively common for senior officers late in the war.

==Later life and death==
Hunter served in the honor guard at the funeral of Abraham Lincoln and accompanied his body back to Springfield. He was the president of the military commission trying the conspirators of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, from May 8 to July 15, 1865. He retired from the army in July 1866. He was the author of &quot;Report of the Military Services of Gen. David Hunter, U.S.A., during the War of the Rebellion&quot;, published in 1873.

Hunter died in Washington, D.C., and is buried at the Princeton Cemetery in Princeton, New Jersey.

<text>The gadfly petrels or Pterodroma are a genus of about 35 species of petrels, part of the seabird order Procellariiformes. The gadfly petrels are named for their speedy weaving flight, as if evading gadflies (horseflies). The flight action is also reflected in the name &quot;Pterodroma&quot;, from Ancient Greek &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;wing&quot; and &quot;dromos&quot;, &quot;runner&quot;.

The short, sturdy bills of these medium to large petrels are adapted for soft prey that they pick from the ocean surface. They have twisted intestines for digesting marine animals that have unusual biochemistries.

Their complex wing and face marking are probably for interspecific recognition.

These birds nest in colonies on islands and are pelagic when not breeding. One white egg is laid usually in a burrow or on open ground. They are nocturnal at the breeding colonies.

While generally wide-ranging, most &quot;Pterodroma&quot; species are confined to a single ocean basin (e.g. Atlantic), and vagrancy is not as common amongst the genus as in some other seabird species (c.f. the storm petrels Hydrobatidae). Eleven species in this genus breed in the New Zealand region, and six of these are only found there.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot; was introduced in 1856 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;pteron&quot; meaning &quot;wing&quot; with &quot;dromos &quot; meaning &quot;racer&quot; or &quot;runner&quot;. The type species was subsequently designated as the great-winged petrel by the American ornithologist Elliott Coues in 1866.

The species listed here are those recognised in the online list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The genus includes 35 species, of which one has become possibly extinct in historical times.

<text>His (or Her) Majesty&#x27;s Principal Secretary of State for India, known for short as the India secretary or the Indian secretary, was the British Cabinet minister and the political head of the India Office responsible for the governance of the British Indian Empire, including Aden, Burma and the Persian Gulf Residency. The post was created in 1858 when the East India Company&#x27;s rule in Bengal ended and India, except for the Princely States, was brought under the direct administration of the government in Whitehall in London, beginning the official colonial period under the British Empire.

In 1937, the India Office was reorganised which separated Burma and Aden under a new Burma Office, but the same secretary of state headed both departments and a new title was established as His Majesty&#x27;s Principal Secretary of State for India and Burma. The India Office and its secretary of state were abolished in August 1947, when the United Kingdom granted independence in the Indian Independence Act, which created two new independent dominions, India and Pakistan. Burma soon achieved independence separately in early 1948.

<doc id="224443" wikidata="Q207767" url="?curid=224443" title="Procellariidae">
<text>The family Procellariidae is a group of seabirds that comprises the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the diving petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. This family is part of the bird order Procellariiformes (or tubenoses), which also includes the albatrosses and the storm petrels.

The procellariids are the most numerous family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They range in size from the giant petrels with a wingspan of around , that are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the diving petrels with a wingspan of around that are similar in size to the little auks or dovekies in the family Alcidae. Male and female birds are identical in appearance. The plumage color is generally dull, with blacks, whites, browns and grays. The birds feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. Whilst agile swimmers and excellent in water, petrels have weak legs and can only shuffle on land, with the giant petrels of the genus &quot;Macronectes&quot; being the only two species that are capable of proper terrestrial locomotion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In all species, a single white egg is laid each breeding season. The parents take it in turns to incubate the egg and to forage for food. The feeding area can be at a great distance from the nest site. The incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.

Many procellariids have breeding populations of over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited several species of fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The family Procellariidae was introduced (as Procellaridæ) by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1820. The name is derived from the type genus &quot;Procellaria&quot; which in turn is derived from the Latin word &quot;procella&quot; meaning &quot;storm&quot; or &quot;gale&quot;. The type genus was named in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

Procellariidae is one of families that make up the order Procellariiformes. Before the introduction of molecular phylogenetics, the traditional arrangement was to divide the Procellariiformes into a set of four families: Diomedeidae containing the albatrosses, Hydrobatidae containing all the storm petrels, Pelecanoididae containing the diving petrels and Procellariidae containing the petrels, shearwaters and fulmars. The family Hydrobatidae was further divided into two subfamilies, the northern storm petrels in Hydrobatinae and the southern or austral storm petrels in Oceanitinae. A 1998 analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequences found there was deep genetic divergence between the two subfamilies. Subsequent large-scale multigene studies found that the two subfamilies were not sister taxa. The storm petrels were therefore split into two families: Hydrobatidae containing the northern storm petrels and Oceanitidae, containing the southern storm petrels. The multigene genetic studies found that the diving petrels in the family Pelecanoididae were nested within the family Procellariidae. As a result, the diving petrels was merged into Procellariidae.

The molecular evidence suggests that the albatrosses were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the austral storm petrels next, with the procellariids and northern storm petrels splitting most recently.
Within the procellariid family, a genetic analysis based on the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; gene published in 2004 indicated that the genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; contained two distinct clades and was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a group of species moved into the resurrected genus &quot;Ardenna&quot;. The other genera within the family were found to be monotypic but the relationships between the genera remained unclear. This changed when a multigene genetic study published in 2021 provided a genus-level phylogeny of the family.

There are 99 species of procellariid in 16 genera. The family has usually been broken up into four fairly distinct groups; the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. With the inclusion of the diving petrels there are now five main groups.

* The fulmarine petrels include the largest procellariids, the giant petrels, as well as the two fulmar species, the snow petrel, the Antarctic petrel, and the Cape petrel. The fulmarine petrels are a diverse group with differing habits and appearances, but are linked morphologically by their skull features, particularly the long prominent nasal tubes.
*The four diving petrels are the smallest procellariids with lengths of around and wingspans of . They are compact birds with short wings that are adapted for use under water. They have a characteristic whirring flight and dive into the water without settling. They probably remain all year in the seas near their breeding sites.
* The gadfly petrels, so named due to their helter-skelter flight, are the 35 species in the genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot;. The species vary from small to medium sizes, in length, and are long winged with short hooked bills. They are most closely related to Kerguelen petrel which is placed in its own genus &quot;Aphrodroma&quot;.
* The prions comprise seven species of true prion in the genus &quot;Pachyptila&quot; and the closely related blue petrel. Often known in the past as whalebirds, three species have large bills filled with lamellae that they use to filter plankton somewhat as baleen whales do, though the old name derives from their association with whales, not their bills (though &quot;prions&quot; does, deriving from Ancient Greek for &quot;saw&quot;). They are small procellariids, in length, with a prominent dark M-shaped mark across the upperwing of their grey plumage. All are restricted to the southern hemisphere.
* The shearwaters are adapted for diving after prey instead of foraging on the ocean&#x27;s surface; several species have been recorded diving deeper than . They are known for the long trans-equatorial migrations undertaken by many species. The shearwaters include the 20 or so species of the genus &quot;Puffinus&quot;, seven species in the genus &quot;Ardenna&quot;, as well as the five large &quot;Procellaria&quot; species and the four &quot;Calonectris&quot; species. While all these four genera are often known collectively as shearwaters, the &quot;Procellaria&quot; are called petrels in their common names.

==Morphology and flight==

The procellariids are small- to medium-sized seabirds. The largest, the southern giant petrel with a wingspan of , is almost as large as albatrosses; the smallest, the diving petrels have a wingspan of and are similar in size to little auks or dovekies in the family Alcidae. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, bluish greys, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns such as the Cape petrel.

The technique of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared to an average bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed in order to remain in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.

The giant petrels share with the albatrosses an adaptation known as a shoulder-lock: a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort. Gadfly petrels often feed on the wing, snapping prey without landing on the water. The flight of the smaller prions is similar to that of the storm petrels, being highly erratic and involving weaving and even looping the loop. The wings of all species are long and stiff. In some species of shearwater the wings are used to power the birds underwater while diving for prey. Their heavier wing loadings, in comparison with surface-feeding procellariids, allow these shearwaters to achieve considerable depths (below in the case of the short-tailed shearwater).

Procellariids generally have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by resting on the breast and pushing themselves forward, often with the help of their wings. The exceptions to this are the two species of giant petrel, which have strong legs used when they feed on land.

==Distribution and migration==
The procellariids are present in all the world&#x27;s oceans and most of the seas. They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or seasonally in the rest. The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Of the four species of diving petrel, two are found along the coasts of South America, while the remaining two have circumpolar distributions in the Southern Ocean. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas.

Many procellariids undertake long annual migrations in the non-breeding season. Southern species of shearwater such as the sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown that they are able to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200 mi).

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
The diet of the procellariids is the most diverse of all the Procellariiformes, as are the methods employed to obtain it. With the exception of the giant petrels, all procellariids are exclusively marine, and the diet of all species is dominated by either fish, squid, crustaceans and carrion, or some combination thereof.

The majority of species are surface feeders, obtaining food that has been pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, while most of the rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface. The gadfly petrels and the Kerguelen petrel mainly feed at night. In so doing they can take advantage of the nocturnal migration of cephalopods and other food species towards the surface.

The fulmarine petrels are generalists, which for the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies according to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.
The three larger prion species have bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift zooplankton from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. This technique is often used in conjunction with a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if walking on the water.

The diving petrels and many of the shearwaters are proficient divers. While it has long been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using their wings for propulsion, the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the sooty shearwater and more sedentary species such as the black-vented shearwater have shown maximum diving depths of and . Tropical shearwaters, such as the wedge-tailed shearwater and the Audubon&#x27;s shearwater, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface). Many other species of procellariid, from white-chinned petrels to slender-billed prions, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.

===Breeding===

====Colonies====

The procellariids are colonial, nesting for the most part on islands. These colonies vary in size from over a million birds to just a few pairs, and can be densely concentrated or widely spaced. At one extreme the greater shearwater nests in concentrations of one pair per square metre in three colonies of more than one million pairs, whereas the giant petrels nest in clumped but widely spaced territories that barely qualify as colonial. Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes. Hutton&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Puffinus huttoni&quot;) breeds in burrows on the sea-facing mountainside of the Kaikoura Ranges on South Island, New Zealand. The colonies are above sea level at a distance of from the coast. Other exceptions are Barau&#x27;s petrel (&quot;Pterodroma baraui&quot;) that breeds at on the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the snow petrel (&quot;Pagodroma nivea&quot;) that breeds in Antarctica on mountain ledges up to from the open sea.

Most seabirds are colonial, and the reasons for colonial behaviour are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.

Most procellariids&#x27; nests are in burrows or on the surface on open ground, with a smaller number nesting under the cover of vegetation (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel (Kermadec petrel and the herald petrel) can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well.

Procellariids display high levels of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the tendency of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, not the least of which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory&#x27;s shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.

====Mate and site fidelity====

Procellariids, as well as having strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, returning to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer&#x27;s petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory&#x27;s shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site from year to year is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; it has been suggested that the two are linked, with site fidelity acting as a means in which partnered birds could meet at the beginning of the breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from two or three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.

The procellariids lack the elaborate breeding dances of the albatrosses, in no small part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The fulmarine petrels, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has been demonstrated in several species.

====Breeding season====
Like most seabirds, the majority of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, and some of the smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for unknown reasons. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.

Procellariids begin to attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more frequently than females, partly in order to protect a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay a single white egg per pair per breeding season, in common with the rest of the Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female&#x27;s weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy&#x27;s petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.
After hatching the chick is brooded by a parent until it is large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent&#x27;s foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariiformes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around two months after hatching for the smaller species and four months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents, although they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.

==Relationship with humans==
=== Exploitation ===
Procellariids have been a seasonally abundant source of food for people wherever people have been able to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with albatrosses and cormorants) come from the remains of hunter-gatherer middens in southern Chile, where sooty shearwaters were taken 5000 years ago. More recently, procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the northern fulmar in Europe, and various species by Inuit, and sailors around the world. The hunting pressure on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly became extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers; within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk. Several species of procellariid have gone extinct in the Pacific since the arrival of humans, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the practice of harvesting what are known as muttonbirds continues today.

===Threats and conservation===
While some species of procellariid have populations that number in the millions, many species are much less common and several are threatened with extinction. Human activities have caused dramatic declines in the numbers of some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the IUCN 43 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with 12 critically endangered. Procellariids are threatened by many threats, but introduced species on their breeding grounds, light pollution, marine fisheries particularly bycatch, pollution, exploitation and climate change are the main threats measures as the number of species involved.

The most pressing threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, and for the most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand&#x27;s Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould&#x27;s petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (&quot;Pisonia umbellifera&quot;), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.
Larger species of procellariid face similar problems to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will steal bait from the long lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In the case of the spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as vulnerable. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).

Procellariids are vulnerable to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam is a problem for the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau&#x27;s petrel, the Newell&#x27;s shearwater or the Cory&#x27;s shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau&#x27;s petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.

Conservationists are working with governments and fisheries to prevent further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. On 20 June 2001, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was signed by seven major fishing nations. The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries by-catch, protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species. The developing field of island restoration, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes. Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed. At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird by-catch. The Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru and the United Kingdom. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.

<doc id="224445" wikidata="Q729868" url="?curid=224445" title="Implied bill of rights">
<text>The implied bill of rights () is a theory in Canadian jurisprudence which proposed that as a consequence of the British North America Act, certain important civil liberties could not be abrogated by the government. The significance of an implied bill of rights has decreased since the adoption of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, an entrenched written bill of rights, but remains important for understanding the evolution of Canadian human rights law and the Constitution of Canada. In the 1938 decision of &quot;Reference Re Alberta Statutes&quot;, a concurring opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada first proposed an implied bill of rights.

The rights and freedoms that are protected under the &quot;Charter&quot;, including the rights to freedom of speech, habeas corpus, and the presumption of innocence, have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents related to &quot;implied rights&quot;. Although implemented in judiciary law and part of required reading in Canadian law schools, the theory was never codified either in legislation or in the constitution by the majority in the Supreme Court of Canada. Prior to the advent of the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; in 1960 and its successor the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in 1982, the laws of Canada did not provide much in the way of civil rights and it was typically of limited concern to the courts.

==Theory==
The concept of an implied bill of rights developed alongside Canadian federalism. 

Beverley McLachlin the 17th chief justice of Canada stated:

When provincial legislation intrudes deeply into fundamental freedoms of speech, religion, association or assembly, the provincial legislature is creating criminal legislation, which under the distribution of powers is reserved exclusively to the Parliament of Canada by section 91(27) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

Provinces cannot intrude in this area; if they do, such legislation is void and has no effect. Since provincial prohibitions touching on the fundamental freedoms of speech, religion, assembly and association were declared unconstitutional by the courts, and in light of the expansive obiters in the leading cases, the writers were able to claim that there was a bill of rights implicit in the Constitution.

Some constitutional scholars focus on the Preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 as providing the underlying reasons for an implied bill of rights. The relevant part of the preamble reads:

Some authors have taken the view that the words &quot;similar in principle&quot; means that in Canada there must be a parliamentary system of government, acting under the influence of public opinion, of a free press, with free speech. Thus, legislation which destroyed the citizen&#x27;s ability to debate, to assemble or to associate freely would be contrary to Canada&#x27;s democratic parliamentary system of government. This provides an additional underpinning for the claim of an implied bill of rights in Canada&#x27;s Constitution.

Invoked more often before the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; was enacted, it is nonetheless important when questions of parliamentary supremacy and the override power come into play.

==History==

===Jurisprudence before 1982===
In Canadian law, the concept of an implied bill of rights has emerged through various judicial decisions over the years.

* &quot;Reference Re Alberta Statutes&quot;
* &quot;Boucher v the King&quot;
* &quot;Winner v SMT (Eastern) Ltd&quot;
* &quot;Saumur v Quebec&quot;
* &quot;Chaput v Romain&quot;
* &quot;Switzman v Elbling&quot;
* &quot;Roncarelli v Duplessis&quot;

In &quot;Alberta Statutes&quot;, Duff CJ held that:

Cannon J agreed, and also stated:

While Duff&#x27;s and Cannon&#x27;s &quot;dicta&quot; focused on the competence of the provincial legislatures, Abbott J later stated in &quot;Switzman&quot; that the same restrictions applied to the Parliament of Canada as well, declaring that &quot;Parliament itself could not abrogate this right of discussion and debate.&quot;

The concept was expanded in &quot;Winner&quot;, which held that citizens were free to move across provincial borders and live wherever they chose to. &quot;Roncarelli&quot; later held that public officials were subject to the rule of law, and therefore could neither suspend nor dispense it arbitrarily, but must act within their official powers.

===Post-&quot;Charter&quot;===
The Supreme Court revisited the implied bill of rights theory in the &quot;Provincial Judges Reference&quot;. The Court referred to both the &quot;Charter&quot; and the implied bill of rights theory to rule that governments may not compromise judicial independence. As outlined by the majority the proper function of the implied bill of rights after the adoption of the Charter is to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; in the express terms of the constitutional texts. However, while the Court stated that the theory was able to fill in the details of judicial independence, the Court actually relied on the &quot;Charter&quot; to do so. The Court fell short of using the preamble to state new constitutional obligations or limitations. Lamer CJ&#x27;s extensive &quot;obiter&quot; did return Canadian constitutional theory to the classical model of rights implicit in the Constitution which was first developed in &quot;Alberta Press&quot;, &quot;Saumur&quot; and &quot;Switzman&quot;, noting:

The ideas outlined in &quot;Provincial Judges&quot; were developed further in the &quot;Reference re Secession of Quebec&quot;. Together these two cases have been interpreted to expand the reach of unwritten constitutional principles. The 1867 preamble and the Canadian Constitution (including its newer addition, the Charter) are read as a unified whole. The express provisions of the Constitution elaborate underlying, organizing principles. These unwritten principles can shape &quot;a constitutional argument that culminates in the filling of gaps in the express terms of the constitutional text&quot; and that in &quot;certain circumstances give rise to substantive legal obligations&quot; that &quot;are binding upon both courts and governments.&quot;

In Toronto (City) v Ontario (Attorney General), the Supreme Court held that unwritten constitutional principles could not serve as an independent basis to strike down legislation.

<doc id="224446" wikidata="Q38780" url="?curid=224446" title="League of German Girls">
<text>The League of German Girls or the Band of German Maidens (, abbreviated as BDM) was the girls&#x27; wing of the Nazi Party youth movement, the Hitler Youth. It was the only legal female youth organization in Nazi Germany.

At first, the League consisted of two sections: the &quot;Jungmädelbund&quot; (&quot;Young Girls&#x27; League&quot;) for girls aged 10 to 14, and the League proper for girls aged 14 to 18. In 1938, a third section was introduced, the &quot;BDM-Werk Glaube und Schönheit&quot; (&quot;Faith and Beauty Society&quot;), which was voluntary and open to girls between the ages of 17 and 21.

Due to the compulsory membership of all young women, except for those excluded for racial reasons, the League became the largest female youth organization at the time with over 4.5 million members.

With the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945, the organization &quot;de facto&quot; ceased to exist. On 10 October 1945, it was outlawed by the Allied Control Council along with other Nazi Party organizations. Under Section 86 of the German Criminal Code, the Hitler Youth is an &quot;unconstitutional organization&quot; and the distribution or public use of its symbols, except for educational or research purposes, is not permitted.

==History==
The &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot; had its roots in the early 1920s, in the first &quot;Mädchenschaften&quot; or &quot;Mädchengruppen&quot;, also known as Schwesternschaften der Hitler-Jugend (Sisterhood of the Hitler Youth). In 1930, the BDM was founded, and in 1931 it became the female branch of the Hitler Youth. The league of German Maidens was derogatorily nicknamed by the counter-cultural Swingjugend &quot;The League of German Mattresses&quot;, suggesting sexual promiscuity between the sex-separated groups who claimed to be traditional and conservative. Its full title was Bund Deutscher Mädel in der Hitler-Jugend (League of German Girls in the Hitler Youth). In the final electioneering campaigns of 1932, Hitler inaugurated it with a mass meeting featuring the League; on election eve, the League and Hitler Youth staged &quot;evening of entertainment.&quot; It did not attract a mass following until the Nazis came to power in January 1933.
Soon after taking office as &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; on 17 June 1933, Baldur von Schirach issued regulations that suspended or forbade existing youth organizations (&#x27;concurrence&#x27;). Female youth groups were compulsorily integrated into the BDM, which was declared to be the only legally permitted organization for girls in Germany. Many of the existing organizations closed down to avoid this. These Nazi activities were a part of the &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (Equalization) starting in 1933. The &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; between the Catholic Church and Nazi Germany, signed on 20 July 1933, gave a certain shelter to the Catholic youth ministry, but they were the object of much bullying.

The &quot;Gesetz über die Hitlerjugend&quot; (law concerning the Hitler Youth) dated 1 December 1936, forced all eligible juveniles to be a member of HJ or BDM. They had to be ethnic Germans, German citizens, and free of hereditary diseases. Girls had to be 10 years of age to enter this League.

The BDM was run directly by Schirach until 1934, when Trude Mohr, a former postal worker, was appointed to the position of &quot;BDM-Reichsreferentin&quot;, or National Speaker of the BDM, reporting directly to Schirach. After Mohr married in 1937, she was required to resign her position (the BDM required members to be unmarried and without children in order to remain in leadership positions), and was succeeded by Dr. Jutta Rüdiger, a doctor of psychology from Düsseldorf, who was a more assertive leader than Mohr but nevertheless a close ally of Schirach, and also of his successor from 1940 as HJ leader, Artur Axmann. She joined Schirach in resisting efforts by the head of the &quot;NS-Frauenschaft&quot; (Nazi Woman&#x27;s League), Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, to gain control of the BDM. Rüdiger led the BDM until its dissolution in 1945.
As in the HJ, separate sections of the BDM existed, according to the age of participants. Girls between the ages of 10 and 14 were members of the Young Girl&#x27;s League (&quot;Jungmädelbund&quot;, JM), and girls between the ages of 14 and 18 were members of the &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot; (BDM) proper. In 1938, a third section was added, known as Faith and Beauty (&quot;Glaube und Schönheit&quot;), which was voluntary and open to girls between 17 and 21 and was intended to groom them for marriage, domestic life, and future career goals. Ideally, girls were to be married and have children once they were of age, but importance was also placed on job training and education.

At the beginning of World War II, the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (National Labour Service; RAD) became compulsory also for young women. It lasted half a year. Many young women became &quot;Blitzmädel&quot; (&quot;Wehrmachthelferin&quot; or female armed forces helpers) during World War II.

While these ages are general guidelines, there were some exceptions for members holding higher (salaried) leadership positions, starting at the organizational level of &quot;Untergau&quot;. As regards lower (honorary) positions, even members of the JM could apply for them after two years of membership and would then obtain such a position typically at the age of 13. The higher leadership was recruited from members over 18 and was expected to maintain salaried office for no more than 10 years, and to leave the BDM by the age of 30. As a general rule, members had to leave when they were married and especially when they had children.

==Uniform and emblems==

The BDM uniform was a full blue skirt, middy blouse and very heavy marching shoes. In 1939, a new uniform was introduced for regional and national leaders within the League of German Girls, and along with the new uniforms came new rank insignia for leaders. These new rank insignia took the form of a silver, and for higher ranks, gold bullion embroidered open-winged eagle on a black (white, on the summer tunic) shield with various types of borders to indicate grade. They were worn on the left chest of the tunic.

== Leaders ==
Trude Mohr was appointed the first &quot;Reichsreferentin&quot; in June 1934. Her main initiative was to nourish a new way of living for the German youth, stating: 
In 1937, after marrying &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Wolf Bürkner, she became pregnant and resigned her duties.

Jutta Rüdiger (1910–2001) was a special case. She joined the BDM only in 1933, at the age of 23 and after having finished her doctorate in psychology. She obtained honorary positions instantly in 1933 and early 1934, was promoted to her first salaried position (leader of Untergau Ruhr-Lower Rhine) in June 1935 and was appointed &quot;Reichsreferentin&quot; for the BDM (head of the BDM) in November 1937 (aged 27), succeeding Mohr, who had vacated the position on her marriage, as Nazi policy required. She kept this position even until the German defeat, when she reached the age of 34.

 (1912–2008), a countess and member of the higher Franconian aristocracy, was appointed leader of &quot;Gau Unterfranken&quot; in 1933, at the age of 21, which also seems to have been the age when she joined the BDM, as no earlier date of membership nor any previous lower positions are recorded in her case. She was appointed head of &quot;Faith and Beauty&quot; in January 1938, a few days before her 26th birthday, and was discharged in September 1939 because of her marriage with Wilhelm &quot;Utz&quot; Utermann in October 1939. She was followed by an Austrian member, Annemarie Kaspar (b. 1917), who had been appointed &quot;Untergauführerin&quot; at the age of 20 in March 1938 and became head of B&amp;B two weeks before her 22nd birthday. She too married and was discharged in May 1941, to be replaced in June 1941 by Martha Middendorf (b. 1914), who was 27 at the time of her appointment and was discharged already in February 1942, as she too had married. From this time on, Jutta Rüdiger, who was a lesbian in lifelong partnership with Hedy Böhmer, a fellow Nazi traveller, and thus uninterested in marriage, took over to lead the BDM directly, thus holding both leadership positions until 1945.


== Training and activities ==
The BDM used campfire romanticism, summer camps, folklorism, tradition, and sports to indoctrinate girls within the Nazi belief system, and to train them for their roles in German society: wife, mother, and homemaker. Their home evenings revolved around domestic training, but Saturdays involved strenuous outdoor exercise and physical training. The purpose of these activities was to promote good health, which would enable them to serve their people and their country. The &quot;home evenings&quot;—ideally to be conducted in specially built homes—also included world view training, with instruction in history. This instruction would include learning the Horst Wessel song, the Nazi holidays, stories about Hitler Youth martyrs, and facts about their locality and German culture and history. Physical education included track and field sports like running and the long jump, gymnastics (e.g. somersaulting and tightrope walking), route-marching, and swimming. The importance of self-sacrifice for Germany was heavily emphasized; a Jewish woman, reflecting on her longing to join the League of German Girls, concluded that it had been the admonishment for self-sacrifice that had drawn her most. Members were also taught the Nazi Party&#x27;s racial ideas. The League was particularly regarded as instructing girls to avoid &quot;Rassenschande&quot; or racial defilement, which was treated with particular importance for young females.

Holiday trips offered by HJ and BDM – for example, skiing in winter and tent camps in summer – were affordable; children from poor families got subsidies. These offers were popular.

The League encouraged rebellion against parents. &quot;Der Giftpilz&quot; presented the propaganda of a German girl being ordered to visit a Jewish doctor by her mother; the girl protested on the grounds of what she had learned at BDM meetings, and while at the office, remembered the warnings in time to escape being molested by the doctor. She then insisted that her mother admit that the BDM had clearly been in the right.

Ilsa McKee noted that the lectures of Hitler Youth and the BDM on the need to produce more children produced several illegitimate children, which neither the mothers nor the possible fathers regarded as problematic. These and other behaviors taught led to parents complaining that their authority was being undermined. In 1944, a group of parents complained to the court that the leaders of the League were openly telling their daughters to have illegitimate children. Public opinion attributed a great deal of sexual laxity to the members. The preparation camps for the &#x27;Landdienst&#x27; (land service) of girls and boys often lay adjacent to each other. 900 of the girls participating in the 1936 &quot;Reichsparteitag&quot; in Nürnberg became pregnant. In 1937, a prohibition came out saying that camping was forbidden to the BDM.

The &quot;Jungmädel&quot; were only taught, while the BDM was involved in community service, political activities and other activities considered useful at that time.

Before entering any occupation or advanced studies, the girls, like the boys in Hitler Youth, had to complete a year of land service (&quot;Landfrauenjahr&quot;). Although working on a farm was not the only approved form of service, it was a common one; the aim was to bring young people back from the cities, in the hope that they would then stay &quot;on the land&quot; in service of Nazi blood and soil beliefs. Another form of service was as a domestic work in a family with many children.

The &#x27;Faith and Beauty&#x27; organizations offered groups where girls could receive further education and training in fields that interested them. Some of the works groups that were available were arts and sculpture, clothing design and sewing, general home economics, and music.

&quot;Das Deutsche Mädel&quot; was the Nazi magazine directed at these girls.

== Wartime service ==
The outbreak of World War II altered the role of the BDM, though not as radically as it did the role of the boys in the HJ, who were to be fed into the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) when they turned 18. The BDM were told by their leaders during the invasion of Poland that the Poles were a people &quot;worthy of disgust, genuine sub-humans, who deserved to be ruled by a master race.&quot; The BDM helped the war effort in many ways. Younger girls collected donations of money, as well as goods such as clothing or old newspapers for the Winter Relief and other Nazi charitable organizations. Many groups, particularly BDM choirs and musical groups, visited wounded soldiers at hospitals or sent care packages to the front. Girls knitted socks, grew gardens, and engaged in similar tasks. In 1943, &quot;Das deutsche Mädel&quot; urged on the ten-year-olds just joining the Jungmädelbund that &quot;It is as if the Führer had spoken to you ten-year-old girls as well, who are now joining the community. From this day on, your small strength, too, will contribute to winning the war and building a greater and more beautiful Reich.&quot;

Girls also helped stage the celebrations after the de facto capitulation of France (see Second Armistice at Compiègne, 22 June 1940).

The older girls volunteered as nurses&#x27; aides at hospitals, or to help at train stations where wounded soldiers or refugees needed aid. After 1943, as Allied air attacks on German cities increased, many BDM girls went into paramilitary and military services (&quot;Wehrmachtshelferin&quot;), where they served as Flak Helpers, signals auxiliaries, searchlight operators, and office staff. Unlike male HJs, BDM girls took little part in the actual fighting or operation of weaponry, although some Flak Helferinnen operated anti-aircraft guns.

Many older girls, with Hitler Youth were sent to Poland as part of the Germanisation efforts. These girls, along with Hitler Youth, were first to oversee the eviction of Poles to make room for new settlers and ensure they did not take much from their homes, as furniture and the like were to be left there for the settlers. Their task were then to educate ethnic Germans, either living in Poland or resettled there from the Baltic states, according to German ways. This included instruction in the German language, as many spoke only Polish or Russian. They also had to organize the younger ones into the League. Because many Hitler Youth leaders were drafted into the military, the task of organizing the boys into Hitler Youth also fell heavily on the League. They were also to provide help on the farm and in the household. As the only contact with German authorities, they were often requested to help with the occupation authorities, and they put on various entertainments such as songfests to encourage the down-spirited new settlers. Some members were sent to the colony of Hegewald for such efforts even when they had to receive gas masks and soldier escorts.

Conversely, the young Polish girls who were selected for &quot;racially valuable traits&quot; and sent to Germany for Germanization were made to join the League as part of the Germanization.

By 1944, the drafting of boys resulted in most of the &quot;land service&quot; help, with the harvest being performed by girls.

In the last days of the war, some BDM girls, just like some boys of the male Hitler Youth (although not nearly as many), joined with the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; (the last-ditch defense) in Berlin and other cities in fighting the invading Allied armies, especially the Soviets. Officially, this was not sanctioned by the BDM&#x27;s leadership, which opposed an armed use of its girls, even though some BDM leaders had received training in the use of hand-held weapons (about 200 leaders went on a shooting course which was to be used for self-defense purposes). After the war, Dr. Jutta Rüdiger denied that she had approved BDM girls using weapons in her interview with Junge Freiheit:

(...) At the end of the war, Martin Bormann wanted to set up a women&#x27;s battalion. (...) I replied that I wasn&#x27;t thinking about it. Women are not suitable to fight with guns in hand. (...) At the very end I (however) only allowed the girls to be trained in pistol shooting so that they could defend themselves in dire need – or even shoot themselves.&quot;Some BDM girls were recruited into the Werwolf groups which were intended to wage guerrilla war in Allied-occupied areas.

== Dissolution ==
The &#x27;Kontrollratsgesetz Nr. 2&#x27; (enacted 10 October 1945) by the Allied Control Council forbade the NSDAP and all its sub-organizations, including the BDM. Their properties were confiscated.

<text>The Tadorninae is the shelduck-sheldgoose subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans.

This group is largely tropical or Southern Hemisphere in distribution, with only two species, the common shelduck and the ruddy shelduck breeding in northern temperate regions, though the crested shelduck (presumed extinct) was also a northern species.

Most of these species have a distinctive plumage, but there is no pattern as to whether the sexes are alike, even within a single genus.

==Systematics==
Following the review of Livezey (1986), several species formerly classified as aberrant dabbling ducks or as &quot;perching ducks&quot; were placed in the Tadorninae. mtDNA sequence analyses cast doubt on the allocation of several genera; many supposed dabbling ducks and one peculiar goose may more correctly belong here, while some genera believed to be close to shelducks appear to have different relationships altogether.

The available data indicates that the Tadorninae are indeed, as their appearance suggests, somewhat intermediate between geese and dabbling ducks, but the molecular data suggests they are not the only lineage to evolve towards a more duck-like morphology, with the diving ducks and seaducks being more distant.

===Family Anatidae===

====Subfamily Tadorninae====
*Unequivocally placed in this group:
**&quot;Tadorna&quot;: shelducks (Europe, Africa, Australasia; 6 species) – possibly paraphyletic

<doc id="224448" wikidata="Q2408624" url="?curid=224448" title="Canadian Bill of Rights">
<text>The Canadian Bill of Rights () is a federal statute and bill of rights enacted by the Parliament of Canada on August 10, 1960. It provides Canadians with certain rights at Canadian federal law in relation to other federal statutes. It was the earliest expression of human rights law at the federal level in Canada, though an implied Bill of Rights had already been recognized in the Canadian common law.

The &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; remains in effect but is widely acknowledged to be limited in its effectiveness because it is a federal statute only, and so not directly applicable to provincial laws. These legal and constitutional limitations were a significant reason that the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; was established as an unambiguously-constitutional-level Bill of Rights for all Canadians, governing the application of both federal and provincial law in Canada, with the patriation of the Constitution of Canada in 1982. Since patriation, its usefulness at federal law in Canada is mostly limited to issues pertaining to the enjoyment of property, as set forth in its section 1(a)]—a slightly-broader &quot;life, liberty, and security of the person&quot; right than is recognized in section seven of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

==Background==
===Saskatchewan&#x27;s Bill of Rights===
In 1947, Saskatchewan enacted a bill of rights which covered fundamental freedoms and equality rights. It was influenced by proposals for a federal bill of rights made by John Diefenbaker, then an opposition member in the House of Commons from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In turn, the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights is considered to have had a formative influence on Prime Minister Diefenbaker, who thirteen years later, in 1960, successfully introduced the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;.

===United Nations===
In 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Civil rights activists in Canada had for some time been advocating for the elimination from Canadian laws of discrimination based on sex, ethnicity, race and religion; the new declaration led to an increasing call for protection of human rights in Canada.

===John Diefenbaker and a National Bill of Rights===

In 1936, four years before being elected to Parliament, John Diefenbaker began drafting his Bill of Rights. As a young boy, he saw injustice first-hand in the form of discrimination against French-Canadians, natives, Métis and European immigrants.

On March 16, 1950, a decade before the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; became law, Diefenbaker, then a Saskatchewan MP, told a public forum why such a law was needed. Individuals&#x27; freedoms of religion, press, speech and association are threatened by the state, he said. A Bill of Rights was needed to take a &quot;forthright stand against discrimination based on colour, creed or racial origin&quot;.

Diefenbaker advocated for the adoption of a bill of rights during the federal election campaign of 1957. In 1960, as prime minister, Diefenbaker introduced the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, and it was enacted by Parliament.

==Features==
The &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; protects numerous rights, most of which were later included in the Charter. Examples include:
*Freedom of speech in Canada and freedom of religion in Canada (now in Section 2 of the Charter)
* equality rights (more complete rights are contained in Section 15 of the Charter)
*The right to life, liberty and security of the person, and in another section, rights to fundamental justice (the Charter combines those rights in Section 7)
*The right to the enjoyment of property, which is not enshrined in the Charter
*The right to counsel (now in Section 10 of the Charter).

Section 2 of the Bill of Rights reads as follows:

:2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgement or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to:

::(a) authorize or effect the arbitrary detention, imprisonment or exile of any person;
::(b) impose or authorize the imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment;
::(c) deprive a person who has been arrested or detained
:::(i) of the right to be informed promptly of the reason for his arrest or detention,
:::(ii) of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, or
:::(iii) of the remedy by way of habeas corpus for the determination of the validity of his detention and for his release if the detention is not lawful;
::(d) authorize a court, tribunal, commission, board or other authority to compel a person to give evidence if he is denied counsel, protection against self-crimination or other constitutional safeguards;
::(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;
::(f) deprive a person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without just cause; or
::(g) deprive a person of the right to the assistance of an interpreter in any proceedings in which he is involved or in which he is a party or a witness, before a court, commission, board or other tribunals, if he does not understand or speak the language in which such proceedings are conducted.

The notwithstanding wording of section 2 is a precursor to the notwithstanding clause of the Charter.

While the Bill of Rights is considered only quasi-constitutional because it was enacted as an ordinary Act of the Parliament of Canada, it contains the following provision:

:3. (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Minister of Justice shall, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Governor in Council, examine every regulation transmitted to the Clerk of the Privy Council for registration pursuant to the &quot;Statutory Instruments Act&quot; and every Bill introduced in or presented to the House of Commons by a Minister of the Crown, in order to ascertain whether any of the provisions thereof are inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of this Part and he shall report any such inconsistency to the House of Commons at the first convenient opportunity.

:(2) A regulation need not be examined in accordance with subsection (1) if prior to being made it was examined as a proposed regulation in accordance with section 3 of the Statutory Instruments Act to ensure that it was not inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of this Part.

==Criticism and support==
Criticism of the Bill of Rights has mostly centred on its limited effect. The ineffectiveness of the Bill of Rights in achieving its stated aim was the main reason that two decades later, it was thought necessary to adopt a constitutionally-entrenched charter.

The Bill of Rights was (and is) limited in several ways.

Firstly, it does not explicitly amend any conflicting statutes, either to remove conflicts or to insert explicit allowances for the statutes to operate notwithstanding the Bill of Rights. When called upon to apply conflicting laws, the courts typically sought to interpret a later statute as creating a minimal disturbance of earlier law. In practice, that meant that the courts relied on Parliament to repeal or amend any laws contrary to the Bill of Rights. Disappointments for those who wanted courts to enforce rights vigorously included &quot;Bliss v Canada (AG)&quot; and &quot;Canada (AG) v Lavell&quot;. A notable exception was &quot;R v Drybones&quot;.

Second, since the Bill of Rights was not a constitutional amendment, there was some debate as to whether it was binding on future parliaments.

Third, because it is an ordinary statute, the authority of the Bill of Rights is limited to matters set out in Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as being under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.

However, the 1960 Act enumerates some rights (such as property rights and specific legal rights) not protected under the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. For that and other reasons, the 1960 Act is occasionally referenced in court decisions today.

<text>George John Tenet (born January 5, 1953) is an American intelligence official and academic who served as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) for the United States Central Intelligence Agency, as well as a Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at Georgetown University.

Tenet held the position as the DCI from July 1997 to July 2004, making him the second-longest-serving director in the agency&#x27;s history—behind Allen Welsh Dulles—as well as one of the few DCIs to serve under two U.S. presidents of opposing political parties. He played a key role in overseeing intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction in advance of the Iraq War. A 2005 Inspector General&#x27;s report found that Tenet bears &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot; for the United States intelligence community&#x27;s failure to develop a plan to control al-Qaeda in the lead-up to 9/11. Tenet has been criticized for personally authorizing the CIA&#x27;s use of brutal and ineffective torture techniques during his tenure, in contravention of international law, something which he has repeatedly denied.

In February 2008, he became a managing director at investment bank Allen &amp; Company.

==Early life and education==
George John Tenet was born on January 5, 1953, in Flushing, New York, the son of Greek immigrants Evangelia and John Tenet. His father was from the ethnic Greek community of Himara, in Albania, and worked in a coal mine in France before arriving in the United States via Ellis Island, just before the Great Depression. His mother was from Epirus, Greece, and had fled from the communists by stowing away on a Royal Navy submarine.

Tenet was raised in Little Neck, Queens, where as a teenager, he and his older brother Bill worked as busboys in their family&#x27;s diner, the Twentieth Century Diner. Despite Bill and George being fraternal twins, both had different personalities; in his book &quot;Ghost Wars&quot;, Steve Coll described Bill as &quot;reserved, precise, and studious&quot; (he would later become a cardiologist) and George as &quot;loud, sloppy, and boisterous&quot;. Because of his tendency to talk constantly he was known as &quot;the mouthpiece&quot;. Sol Winder, a family friend and later owner of their diner, said he was &quot;the type of guy who could never keep a secret&quot;. He was also interested in the news; the host of a local current affairs host sent him an autograph in response to Tenet&#x27;s letters, calling him &quot;the future editorial page editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He played basketball and softball for his Greek Orthodox church, where he was also an altar server.

He attended Public School 94, where he was president of his sixth grade class; Junior High School 67; and Benjamin N. Cardozo High School. In high school he played soccer and edited the school newspaper, graduating in 1971. After studying at the State University of New York at Cortland, Tenet graduated from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (B.S.F.S.) and received a Master of International Affairs degree from Columbia University in 1978.

==Early career==
For his first job after graduating, Tenet became research director of the American Hellenic Institute from 1978 to 1979 and worked for the Solar Energy Industries Association as Director of International Programs from then until 1982. He then began working for the Senate, first as a legislative assistant and later as legislative director to then–Pennsylvania Senator H. John Heinz III from 1982 to 1985. He was a staff member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) from 1985 to 1988, then Staff Director of the SSCI from 1988 to 1993. Later, Tenet joined President-elect Bill Clinton&#x27;s national security transition team in November 1992. Clinton appointed Tenet Senior Director for Intelligence Programs at the National Security Council, where he served from 1993 to 1995.

Tenet was implicated in an illegal wiretapping case brought by Richard Horn. The CIA invoked the state secrets privilege to force dismissal of the case. It was later reopened and settled out of court, but the sentence claimed that several people including Tenet committed fraud on the court.

==CIA career==
Tenet was appointed Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in July 1995. After John Deutch&#x27;s abrupt resignation in December 1996, Tenet served as acting director. This was followed by the reluctant withdrawal of Anthony Lake, after it became apparent to Lake that his nomination had been successfully blocked by Republicans in Congress. Tenet was then officially appointed Director on July 11, 1997, after a unanimous confirmation vote in the Senate. While the Director of Central Intelligence has been replaced by an incoming administration since Jimmy Carter replaced DCI George H. W. Bush, Tenet served through the end of the Clinton administration and well into the term of George W. Bush. In 1999 the Director declined to reveal the overall budget for intelligence operations (including the CIA) which was a departure from his release the previous two years. This led to criticism from government transparency advocates.

Tenet embarked on a mission to regenerate the CIA, which had fallen on hard times since the end of the Cold War. The number of agents recruited each year had fallen to an all-time low, a 25% decline from the Cold War peak. Tenet appealed to the original mission of the agency, which had been to &quot;prevent another Pearl Harbor&quot;. The trick was to see where danger might come from in the post–Cold War world. Tenet focused on potential problems such as &quot;the transformation of Russia and China&quot;, &quot;rogue states&quot; like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, and terrorism.

===1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade===
On May 7, 1999, during the Kosovo War, U.S. bombers struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Serbia with five JDAM precision guided bombs, killing three Chinese reporters and injuring 20 others. The United States claimed the attack was accidental. In testimony before a congressional committee, Tenet later admitted the strike was the only one in the campaign organized and directed by his agency, though he still claimed it was not deliberate. Later analysis has suggested that a error in a military targeting database maintained by the Pentagon was not corrected or updated in a timely manner and that other systems intended to prevent such incidents failed to perform as expected. As a result of this and other incidents, systematic changes were made to pre-strike Rules of Engagement (ROE) for U.S. pilots, including checklists verifying target information and coordinates. China has never accepted the United States&#x27; version of events, although Tenet in a published work noted in a bit of black humor that in the prelude to the bombing of Iraq, China had, through unofficial channels, provided the Agency with the exact GPS coordinates of their Embassy in Baghdad so as to ensure the CIA knew the precise location.

===Israeli–Palestinian cease-fire===
In 2001 Tenet brokered a short-lived Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire.

===Opposition to release of Pollard===
Tenet strongly opposed releasing convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, going so far as threatening to resign if then President Clinton pardoned him.

===Al-Qaeda and the War on Terror===
By 1999 al-Qaeda had emerged as a significant terrorist threat. The 1998 bombings of two U.S. African embassies were the latest in a string of attacks on American interests in the west Indian Ocean region. And in 2000 the USS &quot;Cole&quot; was bombed in Aden in an attempt to sink her, killing 17 naval personnel.

====Bin Laden Plan====
In 1999 Tenet put forward a grand &quot;Plan&quot; for dealing with al-Qaeda. In preparation, he selected new leadership for the CIA&#x27;s Counterterrorist Center (CTC). He placed Cofer Black in charge of the CTC, and Richard Blee (a &quot;top-flight executive&quot; from Tenet&#x27;s own suite) in charge of the CTC&#x27;s Bin Laden unit. Tenet assigned the CTC to develop the Plan. The proposals, brought out in September, sought to penetrate Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;Afghan sanctuary&quot; with U.S. and Afghan agents, in order to obtain information on and mount operations against Bin Laden&#x27;s network. In October, officers from the Bin Laden unit visited northern Afghanistan. Once the Plan was finalized, the Agency created a &quot;Qaeda cell&quot; (whose functions overlapped those of the CTC&#x27;s Bin Laden unit) to give operational leadership to the effort.

The CIA concentrated its inadequate financial resources on the Plan, so that at least some of its more modest aspirations were realized. Intelligence collection efforts on bin Laden and al-Qaeda increased significantly from 1999. &quot;By 9/11&quot;, said Tenet, &quot;a map would show that these collection programs and human [reporting] networks were in place in such numbers as to nearly cover Afghanistan&quot;. (But this excluded Bin Laden&#x27;s inner circle itself.)

Contrary to the 2005 Inspector General&#x27;s report, George Tenet had in fact reported the potential threat to then national security advisor Condoleezza Rice during an urgent meeting on July 10, 2001, in which his team informed her that &quot;There will be significant terrorist attacks against the United States in the coming weeks or months.&quot;

====Predator drone====
The CIA also experimented with a small remote-controlled reconnaissance aircraft, the Predator, to try to spot Bin Laden in Afghanistan. A series of flights in autumn 2000, overseen by CTC officials and flown by USAF drone pilots from a control room at the CIA&#x27;s Langley headquarters, produced probable sightings of the al-Qaeda leader.

Black and others became advocates of arming the Predator with adapted Hellfire anti-tank missiles to try to kill Bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders in targeted killings. But there were both legal and technical issues. Tenet in particular was concerned about the CIA moving back into the business of targeted killing. And a series of live-fire tests in the Great Basin Desert in Nevada in summer 2001 produced mixed results.

Tenet advised cautiously on the matter at a meeting of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee on September 4, 2001. If the Cabinet wanted to empower the CIA to field a lethal drone, Tenet said, &quot;they should do so with their eyes wide open, fully aware of the potential fallout if there were a controversial or mistaken strike&quot;. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice concluded that the armed Predator was required, but evidently not ready. It was agreed to recommend to the CIA to resume reconnaissance flights. The &quot;previously reluctant&quot; Tenet then ordered the Agency to do so. The CIA was authorized to &quot;deploy the system with weapons-capable aircraft&quot;.

====September 11 attacks====
After the September 11 attacks, many observers criticized the Intelligence Community for numerous &quot;intelligence failures&quot; as one of the major reasons why the attacks were not prevented.

Tenet testified before a public hearing of the 9/11 Commission investigating 9/11, that he did not meet with Bush in August 2001, the month before the September 11 attacks. The same evening after the hearings, a CIA spokesman corrected Tenet&#x27;s testimony, stating that Tenet did indeed meet with Bush twice in August. Tenet in his memoir writes of his memorable visit to Bush at Bush&#x27;s ranch in Crawford, Texas, in August 2001.

In August 2007, a report written by the CIA inspector general was made public (originally written in 2005 but kept classified). The 19-page summary states that Tenet knew the dangers of Al Qaeda well before September 2001, but that the leadership of the CIA did not do enough to prevent any attacks and that Tenet personally &quot;bears ultimate responsibility&quot; for the intelligence community&#x27;s failure to develop a plan to counter al Qaeda. Tenet reacted to the publication of this report by calling it &quot;flat wrong&quot;, citing in particular the planning efforts of the past two years.

Tenet immediately increased the size and capability of the CIA&#x27;s special operations component housed in the Special Operations Group of the Special Activities Division. This force had been allowed to diminish under the early Clinton administration. These paramilitary officers were the first to enter both Afghanistan and Iraq. Once in these countries these officers organized and led the Northern Alliance against the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Kurds against Ansar Al-Islam and Saddam&#x27;s forces in Iraq. The rebuilding of this capability and the successful employment of these elite commandos is considered one of Tenet&#x27;s greatest achievements in the Global War on Terror. The increased use of paramilitary officers led to fatalities in their ranks. The first of these was Johnny Micheal Spann, a former Marine Corps officer killed during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi on 25 November 2001. Tenet personally informed CIA staff of Spann&#x27;s death.

====Worldwide Attack Matrix====
Tenet considered that his Al-Qaeda plan had placed the CIA in a better position to respond after the September 11 attacks. As he put it,
How could [an intelligence] community without a strategic plan tell the president of the United States just four days after 9/11 how to attack the Afghan sanctuary and operate against al-Qa&#x27;ida in ninety-two countries around the world?

This was at a meeting of the restricted National Security Councilor &quot;war council&quot;—at Camp David on September 15, 2001. Tenet presented the Worldwide Attack Matrix, a blueprint for what became known as the War on Terror. He proposed firstly to send CIA teams into Afghanistan to collect intelligence on, and mount covert operations against, al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The teams would act jointly with military Special Operations units. &quot;President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.&quot;

====Waterboarding and enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs)====

During Tenet&#x27;s directorship, President Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and other forms of torture (euphemistically referred to as &quot;Enhanced Interrogation Techniques&quot;) during interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, all suspected Al Qaida members. The CIA&#x27;s directors (George Tenet, Porter Goss and Michael Hayden) provided inaccurate and misleading information to members of the U.S. Congress, the White House and the Director of National Intelligence about the program&#x27;s effectiveness and the number of prisoners that the CIA held. 

===Iraq WMD controversy===
According to a report by veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward in his book &quot;Plan of Attack&quot;, Tenet privately lent his personal authority to the intelligence reports about weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq. At a meeting in December 2002, he assured Bush that the evidence that Iraq had WMDs amounted to a &quot;slam dunk case&quot;. After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet stated that it was taken out of context. He indicated that it was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people to support invading Iraq. The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S.-led Coalition forces yielded no significant WMDs.

In September 2002, the Senate Intelligence Committee met with Tenet in a closed-door session. Sen. Bob Graham requested a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq. Tenet responded by saying &quot;We&#x27;ve never done a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq&quot; and resisted the request to provide one to Congress. Graham insisted &quot;This is the most important decision that we as members of Congress and that the people of America are likely to make in the foreseeable future. We want to have the best understanding of what it is we&#x27;re about to get involved with.&quot; Tenet refused to do a report on the military or occupation phase, but reluctantly agreed to do a NIE on the weapons of mass destruction. Graham described the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting with Tenet as &quot;the turning point in our attitude towards Tenet and our understanding of how the intelligence community has become so submissive to the desires of the administration. The administration wasn&#x27;t using intelligence to inform their judgment; they were using intelligence as part of a public relations campaign to justify their judgment.&quot;

Congress voted to support the Iraq war based on the NIE Tenet provided in October 2002. However, the bipartisan &quot;Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Prewar Intelligence&quot; released on July 7, 2004, concluded that the key findings in the 2002 NIE either overstated, or were not supported by, the actual intelligence. The Senate report also found the US Intelligence Community to suffer from a &quot;broken corporate culture and poor management&quot; that resulted in a NIE which was completely wrong in almost every respect.

===Resignation===
Citing &quot;personal reasons,&quot; Tenet submitted his resignation to President Bush on June 3, 2004. Tenet said his resignation &quot;was a personal decision and had only one basis—in fact, the well-being of my wonderful family—nothing more and nothing less.&quot; He officially left on July 11, exactly seven years after being appointed by Clinton. Former DCI Stansfield Turner said, &quot;I think the president feels he&#x27;s in enough trouble that he&#x27;s got to begin to cast some of the blame for the morass that we are in in Iraq on to somebody else and this was one subtle way to do it.&quot; However, Bush voiced support for Tenet&#x27;s efforts, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry he&#x27;s leaving. He&#x27;s done a superb job on behalf of the American people.&quot;

James Pavitt, his Deputy Director for Operations at the CIA, announced his resignation the following day. That led to speculation that the exit of both senior intelligence officials was related to the controversy over the September 11 attacks, alleged Iraqi WMDs, and the decision to go to war with Iraq. After Tenet left, John E. McLaughlin served as acting director until Porter Goss was sworn to the position in on September 24, two days after the Senate approved him. Tenet&#x27;s seven-year term as Director of Central Intelligence was the second-longest in US history, after Allen Dulles.

Human Rights Watch and &quot;The New York Times&quot; Editorial board have called for the prosecution of Tenet &quot;for conspiracy to torture as well as other crimes.&quot;

==Later life==

On December 14, 2004, President George W. Bush awarded Tenet the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along with Tommy Franks and Paul Bremer. Bush said that Tenet &quot;was one of the first to recognize and address the growing threat to America from radical terrorist networks.&quot; However, Bush&#x27;s decision was met with some criticism: Democratic Senator Carl Levin said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think [he] served the president or the nation well.&quot; Democratic Senator John Kerry said through spokesperson David Wade, &quot;My hunch is that George Bush wasn&#x27;t using the same standard when honoring Tenet and Bremer that was applied to previous honorees.&quot;

Tenet spent three years as Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy and Senior Research Associate in the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at his former university the Georgetown School of Foreign service. His official teaching began in the Fall term, 2005.

In October 2006, Tenet joined British defense contractor Qinetiq as an independent non-executive director. Chairman John Chisholm noted Tenet&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary track record and experience in the fields of intelligence and security.&quot; He stepped down from the board in October 2007 (his old position was taken by retired U.S. Navy Admiral Edmund Giambastiani) as well as the board of forensic software company Guidance Software in November. He joined Qinetiq&#x27;s North America board as well as becoming managing director of investment bank Allen &amp; Company. The secretive bank did not announce Tenet&#x27;s appointment, and it was unknown until it was leaked in February of the following year. Tenet is also on the boards of directors of L-1 Identity Solutions, a biometric identification software manufacturer. Along with a number of other notable Greek Americans, he is a member of the advisory board of The Next Generation Initiative, a foundation aimed at teaching students public affairs skills.

===Memoir===
In April 2007, Tenet released his memoir titled &quot;At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA&quot; which was written with Bill Harlow. He appeared on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on April 29, 2007, offering much criticism of the Bush administration. The book was the top-selling book in sales in the first week after publication.

&quot;The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America&#x27;s Pursuit of its Enemies since 9/11&quot; (2006) by Ron Suskind claims that Abu Zubaydah, once said to be al-Qaida chief of operations, was a low-level functionary and mentally ill. In his memoirs, Tenet commented as follows:

Critics pointed out a factual error in Tenet&#x27;s book. On the book&#x27;s first page, Tenet tells of a conversation with then-Pentagon advisor Richard Perle on September 12, 2001, in which Tenet claims Perle told him in person that &quot;Iraq had to pay for the attack&quot;. But the conversation could not have occurred on that day, because Perle was stranded in Paris, France, on September 12 and did not return to Washington until three days later. Perle later stated that the two men indeed crossed each other one morning, as claimed by Tenet, but only later in the same week and not on September 12. But Perle insisted that he and Tenet exchanged no words in that encounter.

== Personal life ==
Tenet is married to A. Stephanie Glakas-Tenet. They have one son, John Michael.

==Recognition==
In 1998, Tenet received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2018, Tenet received the Washington Institute&#x27;s Scholar-Statesman Award.

<text>Carinthia ( ; ; ) is the southernmost and least densely populated Austrian state, in the Eastern Alps, and is noted for its mountains and lakes. The main language is Austrian German, with its non-standard dialects belonging to the Southern Bavarian group; Carinthian Slovene dialects, forms of a South Slavic language that predominated in the southeastern part of the region up to the first half of the 20th century, are now spoken by a small minority in the area.

Carinthia&#x27;s main industries are tourism, electronics, engineering, forestry, and agriculture.

==Name==

The etymology of the name &quot;Carinthia&quot;, similar to Carnia or Carniola, has not been conclusively established. The &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; (about AD 700) referred to a Slavic &quot;Carantani&quot; tribe as the eastern neighbours of the Bavarians. In his &quot;History of the Lombards&quot;, the 8th-century chronicler Paul the Deacon mentions &quot;Slavs in Carnuntum, which is erroneously called Carantanum&quot; (&quot;Carnuntum, quod corrupte vocitant Carantanum&quot;) for the year 663.

&quot;Carantani&quot; may have been formed from a toponymic base &quot;carant-&quot; which ultimately derives from pre-Indo-European root *&quot;karra&quot; &#x27;rock&#x27;. (cf. ), or that it is of Celtic origin and derived from *&quot;karantos&quot; &#x27;friend, ally&#x27;.

Likewise, the Slovene name may have been adopted from the Latin *&quot;carantanum&quot;. The toponym &quot;Carinthia&quot; (Slovene: &lt; Proto-Slavic &quot;*korǫt’ьsko&quot;) is also claimed to be etymologically related, deriving from pre-Slavic *&quot;carantia&quot;.

Carinthia is known as &quot;Koruška/ Корушка&quot; in Croatian and Serbian, &quot;Korutany&quot; in Czech, &quot;Kärnten&quot; in German, &quot;Karintia&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Carinzia&quot; in Italian, &quot;Carintia&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Karyntia&quot; in Polish, &quot;Korutánsko&quot; in Slovak, and &quot;Koroška&quot; in Slovene.

==Geography==

The state stretches about from east to west, and in a north–south direction. With , it is the fifth-largest Austrian state by area. Most of the larger Carinthian towns and lakes are situated within the Klagenfurt Basin in the southeast, an inner Alpine sedimentary basin covering about one-fifth of the area. These Lower Carinthian lands differ from the mountainous Upper Carinthian region in the northwest, stretching up to the Alpine crest.

The Carinthian lands are confined by mountain ranges: the Carnic Alps and the Karawanks form the border to Italy (Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and Slovenia (Carinthia Statistical Region, Savinja Statistical Region and Upper Carniola Statistical Region). The High Tauern mountain range with Mt Grossglockner, , separates it from the state of Salzburg in the northwest. To the northeast and east beyond the Pack Saddle mountain pass is the state of Styria. The main river of Carinthia is the Drava (&quot;Drau&quot;), it makes up a continuous valley with East Tyrol, Tyrol to the west. Tributaries are the Gurk, the Glan, the Lavant, and the Gail rivers. Carinthia&#x27;s lakes including Wörther See, Millstätter See, Lake Ossiach, and Lake Faak are a major tourist attraction.

The capital city is Klagenfurt. The next important town is Villach, both strongly linked economically. Other major towns include Althofen, Bad Sankt Leonhard im Lavanttal, Bleiburg, Feldkirchen, Ferlach, Friesach, Gmünd, Hermagor, Radenthein, Sankt Andrä, Sankt Veit an der Glan, Spittal an der Drau, Straßburg, Völkermarkt, Wolfsberg.

Carinthia has a humid continental climate (Köppen), with hot and moderately wet summers and long harsh winters. In recent decades, winters have been exceptionally arid. The summer precipitation maxima often takes the form of heavy rain and thunderstorms, especially in the mountainous regions. The main Alpine ridge in the north is a meteorological divide with pronounced windward and leeward sides where foehn occurs regularly.

Due to the diversified terrain, numerous distinct microclimates exist. Nevertheless, the average amount of sunshine hours is the highest of all states in Austria. In autumn and winter, temperature inversion often dominates the climate, characterized by air stillness, a dense fog covering the frosty valleys and trapping pollution to form smog, while mild sunny weather is recorded higher up in the foothills and mountains.

==History==
The settlement history of Carinthia dates back to the Paleolithic era. Archaeological findings of stone artifacts in a stalactite cave near Griffen are older than 30,000 years; larger settlements in the Lavanttal, Maria Saal and Villach regions are documented from about 3000 BC. Remains of a prehistoric stilt house settlement were discovered at Lake Keutschach, today part of the Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps World Heritage Site. Skeleton finds from about 2000 BC (near Friesach) denote a permanent population, and intensive arable farming, as well as trading with salt and Mediterranean products, was common already during the periods of the Urnfield and Hallstatt culture. Hallstatt grave fields were discovered near Dellach (Gurina), Rosegg (Frög), and on the Gracarca mountain southeast of Lake Klopein.

===Noricum===

About 300 BC, several Illyrian and Celtic tribes joined in the Kingdom of Noricum, centered on the capital Noreia, possibly located in the Zollfeld basin near the later Roman city of Virunum. Known for the production of salt and iron, the Kingdom maintained intensive trade relations with Etruscan peoples and over the centuries extended the borders of its realm up to the Danube in the north. The Roman Empire incorporated Noricum in 15 BC. Besides the administrative seat of Virunum, the cities of Teurnia, Santicum (Villach) and Iuenna (Globasnitz) arose as centres of Roman culture. The Noricum province remained strategically important as a mining area for iron, gold, and lead and as an agricultural region. In the reign of the Emperor Diocletian (245–313) Noricum split into two provinces: &quot;Noricum ripense&quot; (&quot;Noricum along the river&quot;, the northern part southward from the Danube), and &quot;Noricum mediterraneum&quot; (&quot;landlocked Noricum&quot;, the district south of the Alpine crest). Teurnia became the administrative seat of the latter, as well as an Early Christian episcopal see.

As the Roman Empire declined in the 5th century AD, the Noricum region was exposed to recurring campaigns of Germanic tribes, whereupon the population retired to hilltop settlements. In 408 Visigoth troops under King Alaric I entered Noricum from Italy across the Carnic Alps and allied with the Roman commander Stilicho, who as a result was deposed and executed for high treason (August 408). From 472 Ostrogoth and Alemannic forces campaigned in Noricum, which became a province of Odoacer&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy in 476 and of the Ostrogothic Kingdom from 493. On the death of King Theoderic the Great in 526, the Italian kingdom finally collapsed and the East Roman Byzantine empire under Justinian I temporarily conquered the Noricum region in the course of the Gothic War of 535 to 554.

===Carantania===
From 591 onwards, the Frankish king Theudebert I tried to break into the former Noricum region, and Bavarian settlers entered the area from the Puster Valley in the west. They were however repulsed by Slavic tribes, who, beset by Avar horsemen moved into present-day Carinthia from the east. About 600 the Slavic principality of Carantania arose, stretching along the valleys of the Drava, Mur and Sava rivers. The remaining Celto-Roman population was largely assimilated, jointly challenging Avar and Frankish advance. The name &quot;Carontani&quot; was first mentioned about 700; the lands of &quot;Carantanum&quot; were documented by the chronicler Paul the Deacon (d. 799). The principality was again centered on the historic Zollfeld valley, where the Prince&#x27;s Stone bears witness to the ritual of the investiture of the Carantanian rulers exclusively in Slovene.

While the Carantanian rulers initially joined the tribal union of Samo&#x27;s Empire, Prince Boruth turned to Duke Odilo of Bavaria in around 743 to ask for support against the Avar invaders. Aid was granted, however at the price of Bavarian overlordship. The Carantanian principality became part of the Bavarian stem duchy, while the area was Christianised for the second time by missionaries from the Salzburg diocese. Bishop Vergilius had Prince Boruth&#x27;s son Cacatius and his nephew Cheitmar brought up in the Christian faith. In 767, at their request, the bishop sent Modestus to Carantania as a vicar and had churches built at Teurnia and Maria Saal. Upon a pagan uprising in 772, the forces of Odilo&#x27;s son Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria again subdued the Carantanian lands.

In 788, Duke Tassilo III was finally deposed by the Frankish king Charlemagne, and his territories were incorporated into the Carolingian Empire. By the 843 Treaty of Verdun, the former Carantanian lands fell to the kingdom of East Francia ruled by Charlemagne&#x27;s grandson Louis the German. The ritual of installation of the Carantanian dukes at the Prince&#x27;s Stone near Karnburg in Slovenian was preserved until 1414, when Ernest the Iron was enthroned as Duke of Carinthia.

===Duchy of Carinthia===

The March of Carinthia arose in 889 from the territory bequeathed by Louis&#x27;s son Carloman, king of Bavaria from 865 to 880, to his natural son Arnulf of Carinthia. Arnulf had already assumed the title of a Carinthian duke in 880 and followed his uncle Charles the Fat as King of East Francia in 887. The Duchy of Carinthia was finally split from the vast Bavarian duchy in 976 by Emperor Otto II, having come out victorious from his quarrels with Duke Henry II the Wrangler. Carinthia, therefore, was the first newly created duchy of the Holy Roman Empire and for a short while comprised lands stretching from the Adriatic Sea almost to the Danube. In 1040, the March of Carniola was separated from it, and c. 1180 Styria, the Carinthian March, became a duchy in its own right. After the death of Duke Henry VI of Gorizia-Tyrol in 1335, Carinthia passed to the Habsburg brothers Albrecht II. and Otto IV, and was ruled by this dynasty until 1918. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Carinthia was incorporated in the Austrian Empire&#x27;s Kingdom of Illyria which succeeded Napoleon&#x27;s Illyrian Provinces, but recovered its previous status in 1849 and in 1867 became one of the Cisleithanian crown lands of Austria-Hungary.

===Formation of the state===

In late 1918, the breakup of the Habsburg monarchy was imminent, and on 21 October 1918 the members of the Reichsrat for the German-speaking territories of Austria met in Vienna to constitute a &quot;Provisional National Council for German-Austria&quot;. Before the meeting, the delegates agreed that German-Austria should not include &quot;Yugoslav areas of settlement&quot;, which referred to Lower Styria and the two Slovene-speaking Carinthian valleys south of the Karawanken range, Seeland (Slovenian: Jezersko) and &quot;Mießtal&quot; (Meža Valley). On 12 Nov. 1918, when the Act concerning the foundation of the State of German-Austria was formally passed by the Provisional National Assembly in Vienna this was worded by the State Chancellor, Karl Renner, &quot;...to encounter the prejudices of the world as though we wanted to annex alien national property&quot; The day before, on 11 Nov. 1918 the Provisional Diet of Carinthia had formally declared Carinthia&#x27;s accession to the State of German-Austria. The Federal Act concerning the Extent, the Borders and the Relations of the State Territories of 22 Nov. 1918 then clearly stated in article 1: &quot;...the duchies of Styria and Carinthia with the exclusion of the homogenous Yugoslav areas of settlement&quot;. Apart from one Social-Democrat, Florian Gröger, all the other delegates from Carinthia—Hans Hofer, Jakob Lutschounig, Josef Nagele, Alois Pirker, Leopold Pongratz, Otto Steinwender, Viktor Waldner—were members of German national parties and organizations.

===Disputed frontiers===
After the end of the World War I, however, Carinthia became a contested region. On 5 November 1918, the first armed militia units led by the Slovene volunteer Franjo Malgaj invaded Carinthia and were then joined by Slovene troops under Rudolf Maister. With the subsequent assistance of the regular Yugoslav army, they occupied southern Carinthia claiming the area for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (&quot;Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca&quot;, or SHS) also known as Yugoslavia. The provisional state government of Carinthia had fled to Spittal an der Drau and given the ongoing fighting between local volunteers and invaders on 5 December decided to declare armed resistance. The resistance encountered by the Yugoslav forces especially north of the Drava River around the town of Völkermarkt with its violent fighting alarmed the victorious Allies at the Paris Peace Conference.

An Allied Commission headed by U.S. Lt.Col. Sherman Miles inspected the situation in situ and recommended the Karawanken main ridge as a natural border to keep the Klagenfurt basin intact but, in agreement with item no. 10 of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, suggested a referendum in the disputed area. An armistice was agreed upon on 14 January and by 7 May 1919 the Yugoslav forces had left the state, but Slovene troops under Rudolf Maister returned to occupying Klagenfurt on 6 June. Upon the intervention of the Allied Supreme Council in Paris, they retreated from the city but remained in the disputed part of Carinthia until 13 September 1920.

In the Treaty of Saint-Germain of 10 September 1919, the two smaller Slovene-speaking Carinthian valleys south of the Karawanken range, Jezersko and the Meža Valley, together with the town of Dravograd—together 128 square miles or —were attached to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia): These areas are today part of Slovene Carinthia. The Canale Valley (, ) as far south as Pontebba, at that time an ethnically mixed German–Slovene area, with the border town of Tarvisio (, ) and its holy place of pilgrimage of Maria Luschari () (172 square miles or 445 km2), was ceded to Italy and included in the Province of Udine.

According to the same treaty, a referendum was to be held in southern Carinthia as suggested by the Allied Commission, which was to determine whether the area claimed by the SHS-State was to remain part of Austria or go to Yugoslavia. Much of southern Carinthia was divided into two zones. Zone A was formed out of predominantly Slovene-inhabited zones (approximately corresponding to today&#x27;s District of Völkermarkt, the district of Klagenfurt-Land south of lake Wörthersee, and the south-eastern part of the present district of Villach-Land), while Zone B included the City of Klagenfurt, Velden am Wörthersee and the immediately surrounding rural areas where German speakers formed a vast majority. If the population in Zone A had decided for Yugoslavia, another referendum in Zone B would have followed. On 10 October 1920, the Carinthian Plebiscite was held in Zone A, with almost 60% of the population voting to remain in Austria, which means that about 40% of the Slovene-speaking population must have voted against a division of Carinthia. Given the close supervision of the referendum by foreign observers, as well as the Yugoslav occupation of the area until four weeks before the referendum, irregularities alleged by the deeply disappointed Yugoslav supporters would not have substantially altered the overall decision. Yet, after the plebiscite, the SHS-State again made attempts to occupy the area, but owing to demarches by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy it removed its troops from Austria so that, by 22 November 1920, the State Diet of Carinthia was at last able to exercise its sovereignty over the entire state.

===After World War I to present===

Originally an agrarian country, Carinthia made efforts to establish a touristic infrastructure such as the Grossglockner High Alpine Road and Klagenfurt Airport as well as the opening up of the Alps through the Austrian Alpine Club in the 1920s. It was, however, hard hit by the Great Depression around 1930, which pushed the political system in Austria more and more towards extremism. This phenomenon culminated at first in the years of Austrofascism and then in 1938 in the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany (&quot;Anschluss&quot;). At the same time the Nazi Party took power everywhere in Carinthia, which became, together with East Tyrol, a &quot;Reichsgau&quot;, and Nazi leaders such as Franz Kutschera, Hubert Klausner, and Friedrich Rainer held the office of Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter.

During World War II, Slovene Partisan resistance was active in the southern areas of the region, reaching around 3,000 armed men. The cities of Klagenfurt and Villach suffered from air raids, but the Allied forces did not reach Carinthia before May 8, 1945. Toward the end of the war, Gauleiter Rainer tried to implement a Nazi plan for Carinthia to become part of the projected Nazi national redoubt, the &quot;Alpenfestung&quot;; these efforts failed and the forces under Rainer&#x27;s control surrendered to the forces of the British Army. Once again at the end of World War II, Yugoslav troops occupied parts of Carinthia, including the capital city of Klagenfurt, but were soon forced to withdraw by the British forces with the consent of the Soviet Union.

Carinthia, East Tyrol, and Styria then formed the UK occupation zone of Allied-administered Austria. The area was witness to the turnover of German-allied Cossacks to the Red Army in 1945. The Allied occupation was terminated in 1955 by the Austrian State Treaty, which restored Austria&#x27;s sovereignty. The relations between the German- and the Slovene-speaking Carinthians remained somewhat problematic. Divergent views over the implementation of minority protection rights guaranteed by Article 7 of the Austrian State Treaty have created numerous tensions between the two groups in the past fifty years.

==Demographics==
The largest part of Carinthia&#x27;s population settles in the Klagenfurt Basin between Villach and Klagenfurt. In 2008, the proportion of the population with a migration background in Carinthia was 9.3% of the total population, about half the Austrian figure of 17.5%. By 2020, the proportion of the population with a migration background in Carinthia had risen to 14.5%, yet this figure remains lower than the Austrian average, where close to a quarter of the population has a migration background.

The majority of Carinthia&#x27;s population is today German-speaking. In the south of the province (mainly in the districts of Villach-Land Klagenfurt-Land and Völkermarkt) live Carinthian Slovenes where they speak Slovene and are recognized as an autochthonous ethnic minority. The discussion about ethnic group rights (e.g. bilingual place-name signs) can be very emotional and the rights of Slovenes in Carinthia are still not fully implemented.

=== Population development ===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
== Administrative divisions ==
The state is divided into eight rural and two urban districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), the latter being the statutory cities (&quot;Statutarstädte&quot;) of Klagenfurt and Villach.

==Politics==

The state assembly &quot;Kärntner Landtag&quot;, (&quot;Carinthian State Diet&quot;), is a unicameral legislature. Its 36 members are elected from party lists according to the principle of proportional representation and serve five-year terms, with elections held every five years. Austrian nationals over the age of 16 residing in Carinthia are eligible to vote. The &quot;Landtag&quot; has a threshold of 5%.

The most recent election, the 2023 Carinthian state election, was held on 5 March 2023. The SPÖ, the party of the incumbent governor Peter Kaiser, won a plurality of the vote at 38.9%, giving them a plurality of seats. This makes Carinthia one of only 3 regions of Austria not to have an ÖVP-led government (alongside Vienna and Burgenland), although the ÖVP is the junior coalition member in Kaiser&#x27;s government.

The legislature also elects the state government, composed of a minister-president or Governor, whose ancient title is &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; (&quot;State Captain&quot;), his two deputies, and further four &quot;Landesräte&quot; ministers. The members of the cabinet used to form an all-party government elected under a system of proportional representation based on the number of representatives of the political parties in the &quot;Landtag&quot; in a system known as Proporz, however this system was abolished in Carinthia in 2017.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 20.9 billion € in 2018, accounting for 5.4% of Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €33,000 or 110% of the EU27 average in the same year.

==Language==
German is the official language.

The people are predominantly German-speaking with a unique (and easily recognizable) Southern Austro-Bavarian dialect typical of which is that all short German vowels before double consonants have been lengthened (&quot;Carinthian vowel stretching&quot;).

A Slovene-speaking minority, known as the Carinthian Slovenes, is concentrated in the southern and southeastern parts of the state. Its size cannot be determined precisely because the representatives of the ethnic group reject a count. Recommendations for a boycott of the 2001 census, which asked for the language used in everyday communication, reduced the count of Slovene speakers to 12,554 people, 2.38% of a total population of 527,333.

==Tourist attractions==

Major sights include the cities of Klagenfurt and Villach and medieval towns like Friesach or Gmünd. Carinthia features numerous monasteries and churches such as the Romanesque Gurk Cathedral or Maria Saal in the Zollfeld plain, the abbeys of St. Paul&#x27;s, Ossiach, Millstatt, and Viktring as well as castles and palaces like large-scale Hochosterwitz, Griffen, or Porcia.

Scenic highlights are the main bathing lakes Wörthersee, Millstätter See, Ossiacher See and Faaker See as well as a variety of smaller lakes and ponds. In winter Carinthia offers ski resorts such as the Nassfeld near Hermagor, Gerlitzen mountain, Bad Kleinkirchheim, Flattach, and Heiligenblut at Austria&#x27;s highest mountain, the Grossglockner as well as the Hohe Tauern and Nock Mountains national parks for all kind of alpine sports and mountaineering.

==Culture==
===Customs and traditions===
One of many customs that still subsists all over Carinthia are Kirchtage, a traditional type of fair. The most famous is Villacher Kirchtag in Villach, which was first held in 1936 and is very popular among locals and tourists.

===Museums===
The museums in Carinthia include the Carinthian State Museum with its locations in Klagenfurt, the Maria Saal open-air museum, the Magdalensberg Archaeological Park, and the Teurnia Roman Museum. One of the most important city museums is the City Museum of Villach, which documents, among other things, the life story of its temporary citizen Paracelsus.

===Literature===
Carinthia has produced several internationally renowned writers in recent decades. In the early 20th century, Robert Musil, Josef Friedrich Perkonig, Dolores Viesèr, and Gerhart Ellert gained some notoriety.

After the Second World War, the poets Ingeborg Bachmann, Michael Guttenbrunner, and Christine Lavant first came to the fore. They were followed by Peter Handke, Gert Jonke, Josef Winkler, and Peter Turrini. Among other things, they took a very critical look at their homeland, like Josef Winkler in his trilogy &quot;Das wilde Kärnten&quot;. Other important representatives of Carinthian literature include Janko Messner, Janko Ferk, Lydia Mischkulnig, Werner Kofler, Antonio Fian, and Florjan Lipus.

The most important publishers are Johannes Heyn, Carinthia, and the Carinthian printing and publishing company. Slovenian literature is primarily promoted by the Carinthian publishers Mohorjeva/Hermagoras, Drava, and the Wieser-Verlag founded by Lojze Wieser.

The most important literary event in Carinthia is the Days of German-language Literature in Klagenfurt, during which the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize is awarded, which has been held annually since 1977 and particularly supports younger authors. The Ingeborg Bachmann Prize is one of the most important literary awards in the German-speaking world.

===Fine Arts===
In the early 20th century, the Nötsch circle was active with the painters Sebastian Isepp, Franz Wiegele, Anton Kolig, and Anton Mahringer with its European orientation. The painter Herbert Boeckl was only loosely associated with the circle. An art-political controversy was the dispute over the Kolig frescoes in the Klagenfurt country house from 1931, which ended in the removal of the frescoes in 1938. In terms of architecture, Gustav Gugitz, the builder of the State Museum, should be mentioned, while the Wörthersee architecture with the villas and hotels is primarily characterized by Viennese architects. Switbert Lobisser is known for his woodcuts. Werner Berg made woodcuts and paintings, especially of his adoptive home in Bleiburg.

After 1945, Maria Lassnig, Hans Staudacher, and Hans Bischoffshausen initiated a radical new beginning. Important sites were and are the Carinthian Art Association, the Hildebrand Gallery, the Nötscher-Kreis-Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art Carinthia, which opened in 2003. Two high-profile &quot;art scandals&quot; were the frescoes by Giselbert Hoke in Klagenfurt main station in 1950 and the redesign of the meeting room in the country house in 1998 by Anton Kolig&#x27;s grandson, Cornelius Kolig.

A fountain designed by Kiki Kogelnik stands near the country house. Other visual artists are Valentin Oman, Bruno Gironcoli, Meina Schellander, and Karl Brandstätter. In Carinthia, the architect Günther Domenig designed the Steinhaus am Ossiacher See, the building for the state exhibition in Hüttenberg and the extension for the Klagenfurt city theater.
