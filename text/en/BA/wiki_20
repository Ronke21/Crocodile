<doc id="214856" wikidata="Q209681" url="?curid=214856" title="Categorical imperative">
<text>The categorical imperative () is the central philosophical concept in the deontological moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Introduced in Kant&#x27;s 1785 &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, it is a way of evaluating motivations for action. It is best known in its original formulation: &quot;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&quot;

According to Kant, rational beings occupy a special place in creation, and morality can be summed up in an imperative, or ultimate commandment of reason, from which all duties and obligations derive. He defines an &quot;imperative&quot; as any proposition declaring a certain action (or inaction) to be necessary. Hypothetical imperatives apply to someone who wishes to attain certain ends. For example, &quot;I must drink something to quench my thirst&quot; or &quot;I must study to pass this exam.&quot; The categorical imperative, on the other hand, commands immediately the maxims one conceives which match its categorical requirements, denoting an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself, possessing &quot;intrinsic&quot; value beyond simply being &quot;desirable&quot;. 

Kant expressed his strong dissatisfaction with the popular moral philosophy of his day, believing that it could never surpass the merely conditional command of hypothetical imperatives: a utilitarian says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for those involved, but this is irrelevant to people who are concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for themselves. Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot determine moral action or be regarded as bases for legitimate moral judgments against others, because the imperatives on which they are based rely too heavily on subjective considerations. He presented a deontological moral system, based on the demands of the categorical imperative, as an alternative.

== Outline ==

=== Pure practical reason ===
The capacity that underlies deciding what is moral is called &quot;pure practical reason&quot;, which is contrasted with: pure reason, which is the capacity to know without having been shown; and mere practical reason, by which we determine ourselves to practical action within the phenomenal world.

Hypothetical imperatives tell us which means best achieve our ends. They do not, however, tell us which ends we should choose. The typical dichotomy in choosing ends is between ends that are &quot;right&quot; (e.g., helping someone) and those that are &quot;good&quot; (e.g., enriching oneself). Kant considered the &quot;right&quot; prior to the &quot;good&quot;; to him, the latter was morally dependent on the former. In Kant&#x27;s view, a person cannot decide whether conduct is &quot;right&quot;, or moral, through empirical means. Such judgments must be reached &quot;a priori&quot;, using pure practical reason independently of the influence of felt motives, or inclinations.

What dictates which action can be genuinely considered moral are maxims willed to action from the categorical imperative, separate from observable experience. This distinction, that it is imperative that each action is not empirically determined by observable experience, has had wide social impact in the legal and political concepts of human rights and equality.

=== Possibility ===
Rational persons regard themselves as belonging to both the world of understanding and the world of sense. As a member of the world of understanding, a person&#x27;s actions would always conform to the autonomy of the will. As a part of the world of sense, he would necessarily fall under the natural law of desires and inclinations. However, since the world of understanding contains the ground of the world of sense, and thus of its laws, his actions ought to conform to the autonomy of the will, and this categorical &quot;ought&quot; represents a synthetic proposition &quot;a priori&quot;.

=== Freedom and autonomy ===
Kant viewed the human individual as a rationally self-conscious being with &quot;impure&quot; freedom of choice:

For a will to be considered &quot;free&quot;, we must understand it as capable of affecting causal power without being caused to do so. However, the idea of lawless free will, meaning a will acting without any causal structure, is incomprehensible. Therefore, a free will must be acting under laws that it gives to &quot;itself&quot;.

Although Kant conceded that there could be no conceivable example of free will, because any example would only show us a will as it &quot;appears&quot; to us—as a subject of natural laws—he nevertheless argued against determinism. He proposed that determinism is logically inconsistent: the determinist claims that because &quot;A&quot; caused &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; caused &quot;C&quot;, that &quot;A&quot; is the true cause of &quot;C&quot;. Applied to a case of the human will, a determinist would argue that the will does not have causal power and that something outside the will causes the will to act as it does. But this argument merely assumes what it sets out to prove: viz. that the human will is part of the causal chain.

Secondly, Kant remarks that free will is &quot;inherently unknowable&quot;. Since even a free person could not possibly have knowledge of their own freedom, we cannot use our failure to find a proof for freedom as evidence for a lack of it. The observable world could never contain an example of freedom because it would never show us a will as it appears to &quot;itself&quot;, but only a will that is subject to natural laws imposed on it. But we do appear to ourselves as free. Therefore, he argued for the idea of transcendental freedom—that is, freedom as a presupposition of the question &quot;what &quot;ought&quot; I to do?&quot; This is what gives us sufficient basis for ascribing moral responsibility: the rational and self-actualizing power of a person, which he calls &quot;moral autonomy&quot;: &quot;the property the will has of being a law unto itself.&quot;

==First formulation: Universality and the law of nature==
Kant concludes that a moral proposition that is true must be one that is not tied to any particular conditions, including the identity and desires of the person making the moral deliberation.

A moral maxim must imply absolute necessity, which is to say that it must be disconnected from the particular physical details surrounding the proposition, and could be applied to any rational being. This leads to the first formulation of the categorical imperative, sometimes called the principle of universalizability: &quot;Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&quot;

Closely connected with this formulation is the law of nature formulation. Because laws of nature are by definition universal, Kant claims we may also express the &quot;categorical imperative&quot; as:Act as if the maxims of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature.Kant divides the duties imposed by this formulation into two sets of two subsets. The first division is between duties that we have to ourselves versus those we have to others. For example, we have an obligation not to kill ourselves as well as an obligation not to kill others. Kant also, however, introduces a distinction between &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;imperfect duties&quot;.

===Perfect duty===
According to Kant&#x27;s reasoning, we first have a perfect duty not to act by maxims that result in logical contradictions when we attempt to universalize them. The moral proposition &quot;A&quot;: &quot;It is permissible to steal&quot; would result in a contradiction upon universalisation. The notion of stealing presupposes the existence of personal property, but were &quot;A&quot; universalized, then there could be no personal property, and so the proposition has logically negated itself.

In general, perfect duties are those that are blameworthy if not met, as they are a basic required duty for a human being.

===Imperfect duty===
Second, we have imperfect duties, which are still based on pure reason, but which allow for desires in how they are carried out in practice. Because these depend somewhat on the subjective preferences of humankind, this duty is not as strong as a perfect duty, but it is still morally binding. As such, unlike perfect duties, you do not attract blame should you not complete an imperfect duty but you shall receive praise for it should you complete it, as you have gone beyond the basic duties and taken duty upon yourself.
Imperfect duties are circumstantial, meaning simply that you could not reasonably exist in a constant state of performing that duty. This is what truly differentiates between perfect and imperfect duties, because imperfect duties are those duties that are never truly completed. A particular example provided by Kant is the imperfect duty to cultivate one&#x27;s own talents.

==Second formulation: Humanity==
Every rational action must set before itself not only a principle, but also an end. Most ends are of a subjective kind, because they need only be pursued if they are in line with some particular hypothetical imperative that a person may choose to adopt. For an end to be objective, it would be necessary that we categorically pursue it.

The free will is the source of all rational action. But to treat it as a subjective end is to deny the possibility of freedom in general. Because the autonomous will is the one and only source of moral action, it would contradict the first formulation to claim that a person is merely a means to some other end, rather than always an end in themselves.

On this basis, Kant derives the second formulation of the categorical imperative from the first.

By combining this formulation with the first, we learn that a person has &quot;perfect duty&quot; not to use the humanity of themselves or others merely as a means to some other end. As a slave owner would be effectively asserting a moral right to own a person as a slave, they would be asserting a property right in another person. This would violate the categorical imperative, because it denies the basis for there to be free rational action at all; it denies the status of a person as an end in themselves. One cannot, on Kant&#x27;s account, ever suppose a right to treat another person as a mere means to an end. In the case of a slave owner, the slaves are being used to cultivate the owner&#x27;s fields (the slaves acting as the means) to ensure a sufficient harvest (the end goal of the owner).

The second formulation also leads to the &quot;imperfect duty&quot; to further the ends of ourselves and others. If any person desires perfection in themselves or others, it would be their moral duty to seek that end for all people equally, so long as that end does not contradict perfect duty.

==Third formulation: Autonomy==

Kant claims that the first formulation lays out the &quot;objective&quot; conditions on the categorical imperative: that it be universal in form and thus capable of becoming a law of nature. Likewise, the second formulation lays out &quot;subjective&quot; conditions: that there be certain ends in themselves, namely rational beings as such. The result of these two considerations is that we must will maxims that can be at the same time universal, but which do not infringe on the freedom of ourselves nor of others. A universal maxim, however, could only have this form if it were a maxim that each subject by himself endorsed. Because it cannot be something which externally constrains each subject&#x27;s activity, it must be a constraint that each subject has set for himself. This leads to the concept of &quot;self&quot;-legislation. Each subject must through his own use of reason will maxims which have the form of universality, but do not impinge on the freedom of others: thus each subject must will maxims that could be universally self-legislated.

The result, of course, is a formulation of the categorical imperative that contains much of the same as the first two. We must will something that we could at the same time freely will of ourselves. After introducing this third formulation, Kant introduces a distinction between &quot;autonomy&quot; (literally: self-law-giving) and &quot;heteronomy&quot; (literally: other-law-giving). This third formulation makes it clear that the categorical imperative requires autonomy. It is not enough that the right conduct be followed, but that one also demands that conduct of oneself.

== Fourth formulation: The Kingdom of Ends ==

In the &quot;Groundwork&quot;, Kant goes on to formulate the categorical imperative in a number of ways following the first three; however, because Kant himself claims that there are only three principles, little attention has been given to these other formulations. Moreover, they are often easily assimilated to the first three formulations, as Kant takes himself to be explicitly summarizing these earlier principles.

There is, however, another formulation that has received additional attention as it appears to introduce a social dimension into Kant&#x27;s thought. This is the formulation of the &quot;Kingdom of Ends.&quot;

Because a truly autonomous will would not be subjugated to any interest, it would only be subject to those laws it makes for itself—but it must also regard those laws as if they would be bound to others, or they would not be universalizable, and hence they would not be laws of conduct at all. Thus, Kant presents the notion of the hypothetical Kingdom of Ends of which he suggests all people should consider themselves never solely as means but always as ends.

We ought to act only by maxims that would harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends. We have &quot;perfect duty&quot; not to act by maxims that create incoherent or impossible states of natural affairs when we attempt to universalize them, and we have &quot;imperfect duty&quot; not to act by maxims that lead to unstable or greatly undesirable states of affairs.

==Application==

Although Kant was intensely critical of the use of examples as moral yardsticks, as they tend to rely on our moral intuitions (feelings) rather than our rational powers, this section explores some applications of the categorical imperative for illustrative purposes.

===Deception===

Kant asserted that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In &quot;Groundwork&quot;, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a (and thus contradicts perfect duty). With lying, it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it were universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies. In each case, the proposed action becomes inconceivable in a world where the maxim exists as law. In a world where no one would lend money, seeking to borrow money in the manner originally imagined is inconceivable. In a world where no one trusts one another, the same is true about manipulative lies.

The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in itself. The theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences.

===Theft===
Kant argued that any action taken against another person to which he or she &quot;could not possibly&quot; consent is a violation of perfect duty as interpreted through the second formulation. If a thief were to steal a book from an unknowing victim, it may have been that the victim would have agreed, had the thief simply asked. However, no person can consent to theft, because the presence of consent would mean that the transfer was not a theft. Because the victim could not have consented to the action, it could not be instituted as a universal law of nature, and theft contradicts perfect duty.

===Suicide===
In the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, Kant applies his categorical imperative to the issue of suicide motivated by a sickness of life:A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels sick of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether taking his own life would not be contrary to his duty to himself. Now he asks whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature. But his maxim is this: from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction. There only remains the question as to whether this principle of self-love can become a universal law of nature. One sees at once a contradiction in a system of nature whose law would destroy life by means of the very same feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life, and hence there could be no existence as a system of nature. Therefore, such a maxim cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is, consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty.How the Categorical Imperative would apply to suicide from other motivations is unclear.

===Laziness===
Kant also applies the categorical imperative in the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals&quot; on the subject of &quot;failing to cultivate one&#x27;s talents.&quot; He proposes a man who if he cultivated his talents could bring many goods, but he has everything he wants and would prefer to enjoy the pleasures of life instead. The man asks himself how the universality of such a thing works. While Kant agrees that a society could subsist if everyone did nothing, he notes that the man would have no pleasures to enjoy, for if everyone let their talents go to waste, there would be no one to create luxuries that created this theoretical situation in the first place. Not only that, but cultivating one&#x27;s talents is a duty to oneself. Thus, it is not willed to make laziness universal, and a rational being has imperfect duty to cultivate its talents. Kant concludes in the &quot;Groundwork&quot;:

===Charity===
Kant&#x27;s last application of the categorical imperative in the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; is of charity. He proposes a fourth man who finds his own life fine but sees other people struggling with life and who ponders the outcome of doing nothing to help those in need (while not envying them or accepting anything from them). While Kant admits that humanity could subsist (and admits it could possibly perform better) if this were universal, he states:

===Cruelty to animals===
Kant derived a prohibition against cruelty to animals by arguing that such cruelty is a violation of a duty in relation to oneself. According to Kant, man has the imperfect duty to strengthen the feeling of compassion, since this feeling promotes morality in relation to other human beings. However, cruelty to animals deadens the feeling of compassion in man. Therefore, man is obliged not to treat animals brutally.

=== Application of the universalizability principle to the ethics of consumption ===

Pope Francis, in his 2015 encyclical, applies the first formulation of the universalizability principle to the issue of consumption:Instead of resolving the problems of the poor and thinking of how the world can be different, some can only propose a reduction in the birth rate. ... To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.

=== Game theory ===
One form of the categorical imperative is superrationality. The concept was elucidated by Douglas Hofstadter as a new approach to game theory. Unlike in conventional game theory, a superrational player will act as if all other players are superrational too and that a superrational agent will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational agent when facing the same problem.

== Criticisms ==

===The Golden Rule===

The first formulation of the categorical imperative appears similar to the Golden Rule. In its negative form, the rule prescribes: &quot;Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself.&quot; In its positive form, the rule states: &quot;Treat others how you wish to be treated.&quot; Due to this similarity, some have thought the two are identical. William P. Alston and Richard B. Brandt, in their introduction to Kant, stated, &quot;His view about when an action is right is rather similar to the Golden Rule; he says, roughly, that an act is right if and only if its agent is prepared to have that kind of action made universal practice or a &#x27;law of nature.&#x27; Thus, for instance, Kant says it is right for a person to lie if and only if he is prepared to have everyone lie in similar circumstances, including those in which &quot;he&quot; is deceived by the lie.&quot;

Kant himself did not think so in the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals.&quot; Rather, the categorical imperative is an attempt to identify &quot;a purely formal&quot; and necessarily universally binding rule on all rational agents. The Golden Rule, on the other hand, is neither purely formal nor necessarily universally binding. It is &quot;empirical&quot; in the sense that applying it depends on providing content, such as, &quot;If you don&#x27;t want others to hit you, then don&#x27;t hit them.&quot; It is also a hypothetical imperative in the sense that it can be formulated, &quot;If you want X done to you, then do X to others.&quot; Kant feared that the hypothetical clause, &quot;if you want X done to you,&quot; remains open to dispute. In fact, he famously criticized it for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others.

Claiming that Ken Binmore thought so as well, Peter Corning suggests that:Kant&#x27;s objection to the Golden Rule is especially suspect because the categorical imperative (CI) sounds a lot like a paraphrase, or perhaps a close cousin, of the same fundamental idea. In effect, it says that you should act toward others in ways that you would want everyone else to act toward others, yourself included (presumably). Calling it a universal law does not materially improve on the basic concept.

===Lying to a murderer===
One of the first major challenges to Kant&#x27;s reasoning came from the French philosopher Benjamin Constant, who asserted that since truth telling must be universal, according to Kant&#x27;s theories, one must (if asked) tell a known murderer the location of his prey. This challenge occurred while Kant was still alive, and his response was the essay &quot;On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives&quot; (sometimes translated &quot;On a Supposed Right to Lie because of Philanthropic Concerns&quot;). In this reply, Kant agreed with Constant&#x27;s inference, that from Kant&#x27;s own premises one must infer a moral duty not to lie to a murderer.

Kant denied that such an inference indicates any weakness in his premises: not lying to the murderer is required because moral actions do not derive their worth from the expected consequences. He claimed that because lying to the murderer would treat him as a mere means to another end, the lie denies the rationality of another person, and therefore denies the possibility of there being free rational action at all. This lie results in a &quot;contradiction in conception&quot; (rather than the more practical one &quot;in will&quot;) and therefore the lie is in conflict with duty.

Constant and Kant agree that &quot;refusing to answer&quot; the murderer&#x27;s question (rather than &quot;lying&quot;) is consistent with the categorical imperative, but assume for the purposes of argument that refusing to answer would not be an option.

===Questioning autonomy===
Schopenhauer&#x27;s criticism of the Kantian philosophy expresses doubt concerning the absence of egoism in the categorical imperative. Schopenhauer claimed that the categorical imperative is actually hypothetical and egotistical, not categorical. However, Schopenhauer&#x27;s criticism (as cited here) presents a weak case for linking egoism to Kant&#x27;s formulations of the categorical imperative. By definition any form of sentient, organic life is interdependent and emergent with the organic and inorganic properties, environmental life supporting features, species dependent means of child rearing. These conditions are already rooted in mutual interdependence which makes that life form possible at all to be in a state of coordination with other forms of life – be it with pure practical reason or not. It may be that the categorical imperative is indeed biased in that it is life promoting and in part promotes the positive freedom for rational beings to pursue freely the setting of their own ends (read choices).

However, deontology also holds not merely the positive form freedom (to set ends freely) but also the negative forms of freedom to that same will (to restrict setting of ends that treat others merely as means, etc.). The deontological system is for Kant argued to be based in a &quot;synthetic a priori&quot; – since in restricting the will&#x27;s motive at its root to a purely moral schema consistent its maxims can be held up to the pure moral law as a structure of cognition and therefore the alteration of action accompanying a cultured person to a &#x27;reverence for the law&#x27; or &#x27;moral feeling&#x27;. 

Thus, insofar as individuals&#x27; freely chosen ends are consistent in a rational Idea of community of interdependent beings also exercising the possibility of their pure moral reason is the egoism self-justified as being what is &#x27;holy&#x27; good will because the motive is consistent with what all rational beings who are able to exercise this purely formal reason would see. The full community of other rational members – even if this &#x27;Kingdom of Ends&#x27; is not yet actualized and whether or not we ever live to see it – is thus a kind of &#x27;infinite game&#x27; that seeks to held in view by all beings able to participate and choose the &#x27;highest use of reason&#x27; (see &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;) which is reason in its pure practical form. That is, morality seen deontologically. 

Søren Kierkegaard believed Kantian autonomy was insufficient and that, if unchecked, people tend to be lenient in their own cases, either by not exercising the full rigor of the moral law or by not properly disciplining themselves of moral transgressions. 

However, many of Kierkegaard&#x27;s criticisms on his understanding of Kantian autonomy, neglect the evolution of Kant&#x27;s moral theory from the &quot;Groundwork of Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, to the second and final critiques respectively, &quot;The Critique of Practical Reason, The Critique of Moral Judgment,&quot; and his final work on moral theory the &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot; .

<text>Andrea del Verrocchio ( , , ; born Andrea di Michele di Francesco de&#x27; Cioni; – 1488) was an Italian sculptor, painter and goldsmith who was a master of an important workshop in Florence.

He apparently became known as &quot;Verrocchio&quot; after the surname of his master, a goldsmith. Few paintings are attributed to him with certainty, but important painters were trained at his workshop. His pupils included Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro Perugino and Lorenzo di Credi. His greatest importance was as a sculptor and his last work, the Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, is generally accepted as his masterpiece.

==Life==
Verrocchio was born in Florence in around 1435. His father, Michele di Francesco Cioni, initially worked as a tile and brick maker, then later as a tax collector. Verrocchio never married, and had to provide financial support for some members of his family. He was at first apprenticed to a goldsmith. It has been suggested that he was later apprenticed to Donatello, but there is no evidence of this and John Pope-Hennessy considered that it is contradicted by the style of his early works. It has been suggested that he was trained as a painter under Fra Filippo Lippi. 

Little is known about his life. His main works are dated in his last twenty years and his advancement owed much to the patronage of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and his son Piero. His workshop was in Florence where he was a member of the Guild of St Luke. Several great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Lorenzo di Credi passed through his workshop as apprentices. Beyond this, artists like Domenico Ghirlandaio, Francesco Botticini, and Pietro Perugino were also involved and their early works can be hard to distinguish from works by Verrocchio. Giovanni Santi records that Botticelli, Luca Signorelli, and a young Filippino Lippi also visited or worked in Verrocchio&#x27;s studio. Of the artist&#x27;s pedagogy the Florentine poet Ugolino Verino wrote: &quot;Whatever painters have that is good they drank from Verrocchio&#x27;s spring&quot;.

At the end of his life, Verrocchio opened a new workshop in Venice, where he was working on the statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni, leaving the Florentine workshop in charge of Lorenzo di Credi. He died in Venice in 1488.

==Painting==


Despite the importance of Verrocchio&#x27;s workshop in the training of younger painters, very few paintings are universally recognised as his own work and there are many problems of attribution.

A painting of the Madonna with seated child in tempera on panel (now in the Berlin State Museums, Gemäldegalerie) is considered an early work of 1468–1470.

A painting in the National Gallery in London (cat. no.NG2508) of the Virgin and Child with two angels in tempera on panel, which had not previously been attributed to Verrocchio, was cleaned and restored about 2010 and is now attributed to him with a date of about 1467–1469.

A small painting on panel of Tobias setting out on his journey with the Archangel Raphael, carrying the fish with which he was to heal his father&#x27;s blindness, was probably painted as a private devotional picture. It is an early work which has formerly been attributed to Pollaiuolo and other artists. Covi thinks that it was probably painted with assistance from Ghirlandaio. It is now in London at the National Gallery.

The &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, now in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, was painted in 1474–75. In this work Verrocchio was assisted by Leonardo da Vinci, then a youth and a member of his workshop, who painted the angel on the left and the part of the background above. According to Giorgio Vasari, Andrea resolved never to touch the brush again because Leonardo, his pupil, had far surpassed him, but later critics consider this story apocryphal.

The &quot;Madonna enthroned with John the Baptist and St Donato&quot; is in the Pistoia Cathedral. It had been left unfinished and was completed by Lorenzo di Credi when Verrocchio was in Venice near the end of his life.

==Sculpture==


Around 1465 Verrocchio is believed to have worked on the lavabo of the Old Sacristy in San Lorenzo, Florence.

Between 1465 and 1467 he executed the funerary monument to Cosimo de&#x27; Medici for the crypt under the altar of the same church, and in 1472 he completed the monument to Piero and Giovanni de&#x27; Medici in the Old Sacristy.

In 1467 the Tribunale della Mercanzia, the judicial organ of the Guilds in Florence, commissioned from Verrocchio a bronze group portraying &quot;Christ and St. Thomas&quot; for the central niche of the east facade of Orsanmichele, which the Tribunale had recently purchased, to replace a statue of St. Louis of Toulouse, which had been removed. He therefore had the problem of placing two statues (more than life size) in a niche originally intended for one. As Covi says, the problem was resolved &quot;in a most felicitous manner&quot;. The work was placed in position in 1483 and &quot;has been acclaimed since the day of its unveiling and almost without exception recognised as a masterpiece.&quot;

In 1468 Verrocchio made a bronze candlestick (1.57metres high), now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, for the Signoria of Florence.

Also in 1468 he contracted to make a golden ball (&quot;palla&quot;) to be placed on top of the lantern of Brunelleschi&#x27;s cupola on the Duomo in Florence. The ball was ingeniously made of sheets of copper soldered together and hammered into shape and then gilded. It was completed by the spring of 1471. (The cross on top was made by other hands). The ball was struck by lightning and fell on 27January 1601 but was reconstructed in 1602.

In the early 1470s he made a voyage to Rome, while in 1474 he executed the Forteguerri monument for the Cathedral of Pistoia, which he left unfinished.

A bronze statue of &quot;David&quot; was commissioned by Piero de&#x27;Medici. On grounds of style and technique it was dated by Butterfield to the mid-1460s; he considered it a masterpiece of Verrocchio&#x27;s early career. It was purchased by the Signoria of Florence from Piero&#x27;s heirs Lorenzo and Giuliano de&#x27; Medici in 1476 and is now at the Bargello in Florence. Verrocchio&#x27;s David is a young lad, modestly clad, contrasting with Donatello&#x27;s provocative &quot;David&quot;. For this figure, the Master is purported to have used the young Leonardo, a newcomer to his workshop, as his model.

At a date unknown (suggestions range from 1465 to 1480: Pope-Hennessy said about 1470) he finished in bronze a Putto (winged boy) with Dolphin, originally intended for a fountain in the Medici villa of Careggi and later brought to Florence for a fountain in the Palazzo della Signoria by the Grand Duke Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. It was replaced with a copy by Bruno Bearzi and since 1959 has been kept in a room in the Palazzo Vecchio.

The marble bust of a lady with a bunch of flowers (&quot;Dama col mazzolino&quot;) in the Bargello at Florence is probably from the later 1470s. The identity of the lady is unknown.

The relief for the funerary monument of Francesca Tornabuoni for Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome is also now in the Bargello at Florence. Verrocchio had been at work in the Funerary Monument to Cardinal Niccolo Forteguerri, Pistoia, when he departed for Venice in 1483.

===Statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni===
In 1475 the Condottiero Colleoni, a former Captain General of the Republic of Venice, died and by his will left a substantial part of his estate to the Republic on condition that a statue of himself should be commissioned and set up in the Piazza San Marco. In 1479 the Republic announced that it would accept the legacy, but that (as statues were not permitted in the Piazza) the statue would be placed in the open space in front of the &quot;Scuola&quot; San Marco. A competition was arranged to enable a sculptor to be selected. Three sculptors competed for the contract, Verrocchio from Florence, Alessandro Leopardi from Venice and Bartolomeo Vellano from Padua. Verrocchio made a model of his proposed sculpture using wood and black leather, while the others made models of wax and clay. The three models were exhibited in Venice in 1483 and the contract was awarded to Verrocchio. He then opened a workshop in Venice and made the final clay model which was ready to be cast in bronze, but he died in 1488, before this was done. He had asked that his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, who was then in charge of his workshop in Florence, should be entrusted with the finishing of the statue, but after the considerable delay the Venetian state commissioned Alessandro Leopardi to do this. The statue was eventually erected on a pedestal made by Leopardi in the Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, where it stands today.

Leopardi cast the bronze very successfully and the statue is universally admired, but Pope-Hennessy suggests that, if Verrocchio had been able to do this himself, he would have finished the head and other parts more smoothly and made it even better than it is. Although it was not placed where Colleoni had intended, Passavent emphasised how fine it looks in its actual position, writing that &quot;the magnificent sense of movement in this figure is shown to superb advantage in its present setting&quot; and that, as sculpture, &quot;it far surpasses anything the century had yet aspired to or thought possible&quot;. He points out that both man and horse are equally fine and together are inseparable parts of the sculpture.

Verrocchio is unlikely to have ever seen Colleoni and the statue is not a portrait of the man but of the idea of a strong and ruthless military commander &quot;bursting with titanic power and energy&quot;. This is in contrast to Donatello&#x27;s statue at Padua of the condottiere known as Gattamelata with its &quot;air of calm command&quot; and all Verrocchio&#x27;s effort &quot;has been devoted to the rendering of movement and of a sense of strain and energy&quot;.

<text>Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (2 May 1772 – 25 March 1801), pen name Novalis (; ), was a German aristocrat and polymath, who was a poet, novelist, philosopher and mystic. He is regarded as an influential figure of Jena Romanticism.

Novalis was born into a minor aristocratic family in Electoral Saxony. He was the second of eleven children; his early household observed a strict Pietist faith. He studied law at the University of Jena, the University of Leipzig, and the University of Wittenberg. While at Jena, he published his first poem and befriended the playwright and fellow poet Friedrich Schiller. In Leipzig, he then met Friedrich Schlegel, becoming lifelong friends. Novalis completed his law degree in 1794 at the age of 22. He then worked as a legal assistant in Tennstedt immediately after graduating. There, he met Sophie von Kühn. The following year Novalis and Sophie became secretly engaged. Sophie became severely ill soon after the engagement and died just after her 15th birthday. Sophie&#x27;s early death had a life-long impact on Novalis and his writing.

Novalis enrolled at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology in 1797, where he studied a wide number of disciplines including electricity, medicine, chemistry, physics, mathematics, mineralogy and natural philosophy. He conversed with many of the formative figures of the Early Germanic Romantic period, including Goethe, Friedrich Schelling, Jean Paul and August Schlegel. After finishing his studies, Novalis served as a director of salt mines in Saxony and later in Thuringia. During this time, Novalis wrote major poetic and literary works, including &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot;. In 1800, he began showing signs of illness, which is thought to have been either tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis, and died on 25 March 1801 at the age of 28.

Novalis&#x27;s early reputation as a romantic poet was primarily based on his literary works, which were published by his friends Friedrich Schlegel and Ludwig Tieck shortly after his death, in 1802. These works include the collection of poems, &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Hymns&quot;, and his unfinished novels, &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; and &quot;The Novices at Sais&quot;. Schlegel and Tieck published only a small sample of his philosophical and scientific writings.

The depth of Novalis&#x27;s knowledge in fields like philosophy and natural science came to be more broadly appreciated with the more extensive publication of his notebooks in the twentieth century. Novalis was not only well read in his chosen disciplines; he also sought to integrate his knowledge with his art. This goal can be seen in his use of the fragment, a form that he wrote in alongside Friedrich Schlegel, and published in Schlegel&#x27;s journal &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. The fragment allowed him to synthesize poetry, philosophy, and science into a single art form that could be used to address a wide variety of topics. Just as Novalis&#x27;s literary works have established his reputation as a poet, the notebooks and fragments have subsequently established his intellectual role in the formation of Early German Romanticism.

==Biography==
===Birth and early background===

Novalis, baptized Georg Philipp Friedrich, was the Freiherr (Baron) von Hardenberg, born in 1772 at his family estate in the Electorate of Saxony, the Schloss Oberwiederstedt, in the village of Wiederstedt, which is now located in the present-day town of Arnstein. Hardenberg descended from ancient, Lower Saxon nobility. Novalis&#x27;s father was Heinrich Ulrich Erasmus Freiherr (Baron) von Hardenberg (1738–1814), the estate owner and a salt-mine manager. His mother was Auguste Bernhardine (née von Böltzig) (1749–1818), who was Heinrich&#x27;s second wife. Novalis was the second of eleven children. Although Novalis had an aristocratic pedigree, his family was not wealthy.

Novalis&#x27;s early education was strongly influenced by Pietism. His father was a member of the Herrnhuter Unity of Brethren branch of the Moravian Church and maintained a strict pietist household. Until the age of nine, Novalis was taught by private tutors who were trained in pietist theology; subsequently, he attended a Herrnhut school in Neudietendorf for three years.
When he was twelve, Novalis was put under the charge of his uncle Gottlob Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Hardenberg (1728-1800), Land commander of the Teutonic Order, who lived at his rural estate in Lucklum. Novalis&#x27;s uncle introduced him to the late Rococo world, where Novalis was exposed to enlightenment ideas as well as the contemporary literature of his time, including the works of the French Encyclopedists, Goethe, Lessing and Shakespeare. At seventeen, Novalis attended the Martin Luther Gymnasium in Eisleben, near Weissenfels where his family had moved in 1785. At the gymnasium, he learned rhetoric and ancient literature.

===Jena, Leipzig, Wittenberg: Legal Studies===
Between 1790 and 1794, Novalis went to university to study law. He first attended the University of Jena. While there, he studied Immanuel Kant&#x27;s philosophy under Karl Reinhold, and it was there that he first became acquainted with Fichte&#x27;s philosophy. He also developed a close relationship with playwright and philosopher Schiller. Novalis attended Schiller&#x27;s lectures on history and tended to Schiller when he was suffering from a particularly severe flare-up of his chronic tuberculosis. In 1791, he published his first work, a poem dedicated to Schiller, &quot;Klagen eines Jünglings&quot; (&quot;Lament of a Youth&quot;), in the magazine &quot;Neue Teutsche Merkur&quot;, an act that was partly responsible for Novalis&#x27;s father withdrawing him from Jena and looking into another university where Novalis would attend more carefully to his studies. In the following year, Novalis&#x27;s younger brother, Erasmus enrolled at the University of Leipzig, and Novalis went with him to continue his legal studies. In 1792, he met the literary critic Friedrich Schlegel, the younger brother of August. Friedrich became one of Novalis&#x27;s closest lifetime friends. A year later, Novalis matriculated to the University of Wittenberg where he completed his law degree.

===Tennstedt: Relationship with Sophie von Kühn===
After graduating from Wittenberg, Novalis moved to Tennstedt to work as an actuary for a district administrator, Cölestin August Just, who became both his friend and biographer. While working for Just in 1795, Novalis met the 12-year-old Sophie von Kühn, who at that time was considered old enough to receive suitors. He became infatuated with her on their first meeting, and the effect of this infatuation appeared to transform his personality. In 1795, two days before Sophie turned thirteen they got secretly engaged. Later that year Sophie&#x27;s parents gave their consent for the two to become engaged: Novalis&#x27;s brother Erasmus supported the couple, but the rest of Novalis&#x27;s family resisted agreeing to the engagement due to Sophie&#x27;s unclear aristocratic pedigree.
Novalis remained intellectually active during his employment at Tennstedt. It is possible that Novalis met Fichte, as well as the poet Friedrich Hölderlin, in person while visiting Jena in 1795. Between 1795 and 1796, he created six sets of manuscripts, posthumously collected under the title &quot;Fichte Studies&quot;, that primarily address Fichte&#x27;s work but cover a range of philosophical topics. Novalis continued his philosophical studies in 1797, writing notebooks responding to the works of Kant, Frans Hemsterhuis, and Adolph Eschenmayer.

Novalis&#x27;s ongoing reflections upon Fichte&#x27;s ideas, particularly those in the &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot; (&quot;Foundations of the Science of Knowledge&quot;) formed part of the foundation for his later philosophical and literary works: Novalis focused on Fichte&#x27;s argument that the concept of identity assumes a tension between self (i.e., &quot;I&quot;) and object (i.e., &quot;not-I&quot;). Novalis&#x27;s critique of Fichte arose from Novalis&#x27;s literary commitments: Novalis suggests that the tension between self and object that Fichte asserts is actually a tension between language and imagination. Later, Novalis would take his critique further, suggesting that identity is not the separation of subject and object, but a dynamic process of equal partners in mutual communication. Novalis&#x27;s viewpoint is summarized in his aphorism &quot;Statt Nicht-Ich -- Du!&quot; (&quot;Instead of &#x27;not-I&#x27;, you&quot;).

In the final months of 1795, Sophie began to suffer declining health due to a liver tumor that was thought to be caused by tuberculosis. As a result, she underwent liver surgery in Jena, which was performed without anesthesia. In January 1797, Novalis was appointed auditor to the salt works at Weissenfels. To earn a stable income for his intended marriage, he accepted the position and moved to Weissenfels to assume his duties. Sophie, on the other hand, stayed with her family. Sophie once more became extremely ill, during which time Novalis&#x27;s parents finally relented and agreed to the couple&#x27;s engagement. However, two days after her fifteenth birthday, Sophie died, while Novalis was still in Weissenfels. Four months later, Novalis&#x27;s brother Erasmus, who had been diagnosed with tuberculosis, also died. The death of Sophie, as well as his younger brother, affected Novalis deeply. Their deaths catalyzed his more intensive commitment to poetic expression. Sophie&#x27;s death also became the central inspiration for one of the few works Novalis published in his lifetime, (&quot;Hymns to the Night&quot;).

===Freiberg: The Mining Academy===
At the end of 1797, Novalis entered the Mining Academy of Freiberg in Saxony to become qualified as a member of the staff for the salt works at Weissenfels. His principle mentor at the academy was the geologist, Abraham Werner. While at the academy, Novalis immersed himself in a wide range of studies, including electricity, galvanism, alchemy, medicine, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and natural philosophy. He was also able to expand his intellectual social circle. On his way to Freiberg, he met Friedrich Schelling, and they later went on an art tour of Dresden together. He visited Goethe and Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s older brother, August, in Weimar and met the writer Jean Paul in Leipzig.
In December 1798, Novalis became engaged for the second time. His fiancée was Julie von Charpentier, a daughter of Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Toussaint von Charpentier, the chair of mining studies at the University of Leipzig. Unlike his relationship with Sophie, Novalis&#x27;s affection for Julie developed more gradually. He initially saw his affection for Julie as a more &quot;earthly&quot; passion compared to his &quot;heavenly&quot; passion for Sophie, though he gradually softened this distinction with time. Eventually his feelings for Julie became the subject of some of his poetry, including the &quot;Spiritual Songs&quot; written in the last years of his life. Novalis and Julie remained engaged until Novalis&#x27;s death in 1801, and she tended him during his final illness.

In Freiberg, he remained active with his literary work. It was at this time that he began a collection of notes for a project to unite the separate sciences into a universal whole. In this collection, &quot;Das allgemeine Brouillon (Notes for a General Encyclopedia)&quot;, Novalis began integrating his knowledge of natural science into his literary work. This integration can be seen in an unfinished novel he composed during this time, &quot;Die Lehrlinge zu Sais&quot; (&quot;The Novices at Sais&quot;), which incorporated natural history from his studies as well as ideas from his Fichte studies into a meditation on poetry and love as keys to understanding nature. More specifically, he began thinking about how to incorporate his recently acquired knowledge of mining to his philosophical and poetic worldview. In this respect, he shared a commonality with other German authors of the Romantic age by connecting his studies in the mining industry, which was undergoing then the first steps to industrialization, with his literary work. This connection between his scientific interest in mining, philosophy and literature came to fruition later when he began composing his second unfinished novel, &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot;.
Novalis also began to be noticed as a published author at this time. In 1798, Novalis&#x27;s fragments appeared in the Schlegel brother&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. These works included (&quot;Pollen&quot;), (&quot;Faith and Love or the King and the Queen&quot;), and &quot;Blumen&quot; (&quot;Flowers&quot;). The publication of &quot;Pollen&quot; saw the first appearance of his pen name, &quot;Novalis&quot;. His choice of pen name was taken from his 12th-century ancestors who named themselves , after their settlement Grossenrode, which is called in Latin. can also be interpreted as &quot;one who cultivates new land&quot;, which connotes the metaphoric role that Novalis saw for himself. This metaphoric sense of his pen name can be seen in the epigraph of &quot;Pollen&quot;, the first work he published as Novalis: &quot;Friends, the soil is poor, we must scatter seed abundantly for even a moderate harvest&quot;.

===Weissenfels: The final years===
In early 1799, Novalis had completed his studies at Leipzig and returned to the management of salt mines in Weissenfels. By December, he became an assessor of the salt mines and a director, and at the end of 1800, the 28-year-old Novalis was appointed an &quot;Amtmann&quot; for the district of Thuringia, a position comparable to a contemporary magistrate.

While on a trip to Jena in the summer of 1799, Novalis met Ludwig Tieck, who became one of his closest friends and greatest intellectual influences in the last two years of his life. They became part of an informal social circle that formed around the Schlegel brothers, which has been come to be known as the Jena Romantics or &quot;Frühromantiker&quot; (&quot;early romantics&quot;). The interests of the Jena Romantics extended to philosophy as well as literature and aesthetics, and has been considered as a philosophical movement in its own right. Under the influence of Tieck, Novalis studied the works of the seventeenth-century mystic, Jakob Böhme, with whom he felt a strong affinity. He also became deeply engaged with the Platonic aesthetics of Hemsterhuis, as well as the writings of the theologian and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher. Schleiermacher&#x27;s work inspired Novalis to write his essay, &quot;Christenheit oder Europa&quot; (&quot;Christianity or Europe&quot;), a call to return Europe to a cultural and social unity whose interpretation continues to be a source of controversy. During this time, he also wrote his poems known as &quot;Geistliche Lieder&quot; (&quot;Spiritual Songs&quot;) and began his novel &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot;.

From August 1800, Novalis began to cough up blood. At the time, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, recent research suggests that he may have suffered from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that may have been responsible for the early death of many of his siblings, including his brother Erasmus. After a severe hemorrhage in November, he was temporarily moved to Dresden for medical reasons. In January, he requested to be with his parents in Weissenfels. He died there on 25 March 1801 at the age of twenty-eight. He was buried in Weissenfels&#x27;s &quot;Alter Friedhof&quot; (&quot;Old Cemetery&quot;).

==Legacy==
===As romantic poet===
When he died, Novalis had only published &quot;Pollen&quot;, &quot;Faith and Love&quot;, &quot;Blumen&quot;, and &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot;. Most of Novalis&#x27;s writings, including his novels and philosophical works, were neither completed nor published in his lifetime. This problem continues to obscure a full appreciation of his work. His unfinished novels &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; and &quot;The Novices at Sais&quot; and numerous other poems and fragments were published posthumously by Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel. However, their publication of Novalis&#x27;s more philosophical fragments was disorganized and incomplete. A systematic and more comprehensive collection of Novalis&#x27;s fragments from his notebooks was not available until the twentieth century.

During the nineteenth century, Novalis was primarily seen as a passionate love-struck poet who mourned the death of his beloved and yearned for the hereafter. He was known as the poet of the &quot;blue flower&quot;, a symbol of romantic yearning from Novalis&#x27;s unfinished Novel &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; that became an key emblem for German Romanticism. His fellow Jena Romantics, such as Friedrich Schlegel, Tieck, and Schleiermacher, also describe him as a poet who dreamt of a spiritual world beyond this one. Novalis&#x27;s diagnosis of tuberculosis, which was known as the &quot;white plague&quot;, contributed to his romantic reputation. Because Sophie von Kühn was also thought to have died from tuberculosis, Novalis became the poet of the blue flower who was reunited with his beloved through the death of the white plague.

The image of Novalis as romantic poet became enormously popular. When Novalis&#x27;s biography by his long-time friend August Cölestin Just was published in 1815, Just was criticized for misrepresenting Novalis&#x27;s poetic nature because he had written that Novalis was also a hard-working mine inspector and magistrate. Even the literary critic Thomas Carlyle, whose essay on Novalis played a major role in introducing him to the English-speaking world and took Novalis&#x27;s philosophical relationship to Fichte and Kant seriously, emphasized Novalis as a mystic poet in the style of Dante. The author and theologian George MacDonald, who translated Novalis&#x27;s &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; in 1897 into English, also understood him as a mystic poet.

===As philosophical thinker===
In the twentieth century, Novalis&#x27;s writings were more thoroughly and systematically collected than previously. The availability of these works provide further evidence that his interests went beyond poetry and novels and has led to a reassessment of Novalis&#x27;s literary and intellectual goals. He was deeply read in science, law, philosophy, politics and political economy and left an abundance of notes on these topics. His early work displays his ease and familiarity with these diverse fields. His later works also include topics from his professional duties. In his notebooks, Novalis also reflected on the scientific, aesthetic, and philosophical significance of his interests. In his &quot;Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia&quot;, he worked out connections between the different fields he studied as he sought to integrate them into a unified worldview.

Novalis&#x27;s philosophical writings are often grounded in nature. His works explore how personal freedom and creativity emerge in the affective understanding of the world and others. He suggests that this can only be accomplished if people are not estranged from the earth. In &quot;Pollen&quot;, Novalis writes &quot;We are on a mission: Our calling is the cultivation of the earth&quot;, arguing that human beings come to know themselves through experiencing and enlivening nature. Novalis&#x27;s personal commitment to understanding one&#x27;s self and the world through nature can be seen in Novalis&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot;, in which he uses his knowledge of natural science derived from his work overseeing salt mining to understand the human condition. Novalis&#x27;s commitment to cultivating nature has even been considered as a potential source of insight for a deeper understanding of the environmental crisis.

==Magical idealism==

Novalis&#x27;s personal worldview—informed by his education, philosophy, professional knowledge, and pietistic background—has become known as &quot;magical idealism&quot;, a name derived from Novalis&#x27;s reference in his 1798 notebooks to a type of literary prophet, the &quot;magischer Idealist&quot; (&quot;magical idealist&quot;). In this worldview, philosophy and poetry are united. Magical idealism is Novalis&#x27;s synthesis of the German idealism of Fichte and Schelling with the creative imagination. The goal of the creative imagination is to break down the barriers between language and world, as well as the subject and object. The &quot;magic&quot; is the enlivening of nature as it responds to our will.

Another element of Novalis&#x27;s magical idealism is his concept of &quot;love&quot;. In Novalis&#x27;s view, love is a sense of relationship and sympathy between all beings in the world, which is considered both the basis of magic and its goal. From one perspective, Novalis&#x27;s emphasis on the term &quot;magic&quot; represents a challenge to what he perceived as the disenchantment that came with modern rationalistic thinking.From another perspective, however, Novalis&#x27;s use of &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;love&quot; in his writing is a performative act that enacts a key aspect of his philosophical and literary goals. These words are meant to startle readers into attentiveness, making them aware of his use of the arts, particularly poetry with its metaphor and symbolism, to explore and unify various understandings of nature in his all-embracing investigations.

Magical idealism also addresses the idea of health. Novalis derived his theory of health from the Scottish physician John Brown&#x27;s system of medicine, which sees illness as a mismatch between sensory stimulation and internal state. Novalis extends this idea by suggesting that illness arises from a disharmony between the self and the world of nature. This understanding of health is immanent: the &quot;magic&quot; is not otherworldly, it is based on the body and mind&#x27;s relationship to the environment. According to Novalis, health is maintained when we use our bodies as means to sensitively perceive the world rather than to control the world: the ideal is where the individual and the world interplay harmoniously. It has been argued that there is an anxiety in Novalis&#x27;s sense of magical idealism that denies actual touch, which leads inevitably to death, and replaces it with an idea of &quot;distant touch&quot;.

==Religious views==

Novalis&#x27;s religious perspective remains a subject of debate. Novalis&#x27;s early rearing in a Pietist household affected him through this life. The impact of his religious background on his writings are particularly clear in his two major poetic works. &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; contains many Christian symbols and themes. And, Novalis&#x27;s &quot;Spiritual Songs&quot;, which were posthumously published in 1802 were incorporated into Lutheran hymnals; Novalis called the poems &quot;Christian Songs&quot;, and they were intended to be published in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; under the title &quot;Specimens From a New Devotional Hymn Book&quot;. One of his final works, which was posthumously named &quot;Die Christenheit oder Europa&quot; (&quot;Christianity or Europe&quot;) when it was first published in full in 1826, has generated a great deal of controversy regarding Novalis&#x27;s religious views. This essay, which Novalis himself had simply entitled &quot;Europa&quot;, called for European unity in Novalis&#x27;s time by poetically referencing a mythical Medieval golden age when Europe was unified under the Catholic Church.

One view of Novalis&#x27;s work is that it maintains a traditional Christian outlook. Novalis&#x27;s brother Karl writes that during his final illness, Novalis would read the works of the theologians Nicolaus Zinzendorf and Johann Kaspar Lavater, as well as the Bible. On the other hand, during the decades following Novalis&#x27;s death, German intellectuals, such as the author Karl Hillebrand and the literary critic Hermann Theodor Hettner thought that Novalis was essentially a Catholic in his thinking. In the twentieth century, this view of Novalis has sometimes led to negative assessments of his work. &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; has been described as an attempt by Novalis to use religion to avoid the challenges of modernity, and &quot;Christianity or Europe&quot; has been described variously as desperate prayer, a reactionary manifesto or a theocratic dream.

Another view of Novalis&#x27;s work is that it reflects a Christian mysticism. After Novalis died, the Jena Romantics wrote of him as a seer who would bring forth a new gospel: one who lived his life as one aiming toward the spiritual while looking at death as a means of overcoming human limitation in a revolutionary movement toward God. In this more romantic view, Novalis was a visionary who saw contemporary Christianity as a stage to an even higher expression of religion where earthly love rises to a heavenly love as death itself is defeated by that love. At the end of the nineteenth century, the playwright and poet Maurice Maeterlinck also described Novalis as a mystic. However, Maeterlinck acknowledged the impact of Novalis&#x27;s intellectual interests on his religious views, describing Novalis as a &quot;scientific mystic&quot; and comparing him to the physicist and philosopher Blaise Pascal.

More recently, Novalis&#x27;s religious outlook has been analysed from the point of view of his philosophical and aesthetic commitments. In this view, Novalis&#x27;s religious thought was based on his attempts to reconcile Fichte&#x27;s idealism, in which the sense of self arises in the distinction of subject and object, with Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s naturalistic philosophy, in which all being is one substance. Novalis sought a single principle through which the division between ego and nature becomes mere appearance. As Novalis&#x27;s philosophical thinking on religion developed, it became influenced by the Platonism of Hemsterhuis, as well as the Neoplatonism of Plotinus. Accordingly, Novalis aimed to synthesize naturalism and theism into a &quot;religion of the visible cosmos&quot;. Novalis believed that individuals could obtain mystic insight, but religion can remain rational: God could be a Neoplatonic object of intellectual intuition and rational perception, the logos that structures the universe. In Novalis&#x27;s view, this vision of the logos is not merely intellectual, but moral too, as Novalis states &quot;god is virtue itself&quot;. This vision includes Novalis&#x27;s idea of love, in which self and nature united in a mutually supportive existence. This understanding of Novalis&#x27;s religious project is illustrated by a quote from one of his notes in his &quot;Fichte-Studien&quot; (&quot;Fichte Studies&quot;): &quot;Spinoza ascended as far as nature- Fichte to the &#x27;I&#x27;, or the person, I ascend to the thesis of God&quot;.

According to this Neoplatonic reading of Novalis, his religious language can be understood using the &quot;magic wand of analogy&quot;, a phrase Novalis used in &quot;Europe and Christianity&quot; to clarify how he meant to use history in that essay. This use of analogy was partly inspired by Schiller, who argued that analogy allows facts to be connected into a harmonious whole, and by his relationship with Friedrich Schlegel, who sought to explore the revelations of religion through the union of philosophy and poetry. The &quot;magic wand of analogy&quot; allowed Novalis to use metaphor, analogy and symbolism to bring together the arts, science, and philosophy in his search for truth. This view of Novalis&#x27;s writing suggests that his literary language must be read carefully. His metaphors and images- even in works like &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot;- are not only mystical utterances, they also express philosophical arguments. Read in this perspective, a work like Novalis&#x27;s &quot;Christianity or Europe&quot; is not a call to return to a lost golden age. Rather, it is an argument in poetic language, phrased in the mode of a myth, for a cosmopolitan vision of a unity that brings together past and future, ideal and real, to engage the listener in an unfinished historical process.

==Writings==
===Poetry===

Novalis is best known as a German Romantic poet. His two sets of poems, &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Songs&quot;, are considered his major lyrical achievements. &quot;Hymns to the Night&quot; were begun in 1797 after the death of Sophie von Kühn. About eight months after they were completed, a revised edition of the poems was published in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. The &quot;Spiritual Songs&quot;, which were written in 1799, were posthumously published in 1802. Novalis called the poems &quot;Christian Songs&quot;, and they were intended to be entitled &quot;Specimens From a New Devotional Hymn Book&quot;. After his death many of the poems were incorporated into Lutheran hymn-books. Novalis also wrote a number of other occasional poems, which can be found in his collected works. Translations of poems into English include:
*&quot;Hymns to the Night&quot;
** 
** This modern translation includes the German text (with variants) &quot;en face&quot;.
*&quot;Spiritual Songs&quot;
** 
**

===Unfinished novels===
Novalis wrote two unfinished novel fragments, &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; and &quot;Die Lehrlinge zu Sais&quot; (&quot;The Novices at Sais&quot;), both of which were published posthumously by Tieck and Schlegel in 1802. The novels both aim to describe a universal world harmony with the help of poetry. &quot;The Novices at Sais&quot; contains the fairy tale &quot;Hyacinth and Rose Petal&quot;. &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; is the work in which Novalis introduced the image of the &quot;blue flower&quot;. &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; was conceived as a response to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, a work that Novalis had read with enthusiasm but judged as being highly unpoetical. He disliked Goethe making the economical victorious over the poetic in the narrative, so Novalis focused on making &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; triumphantly poetic. Both of Novalis&#x27;s novels also reflect human experience through metaphors related to his studies in natural history from Freiburg. Translations of Novels into English include:

*&quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot;
** (Translated by Frederick S. Stallknecht and Edward C. Sprague.) 
**
*&quot;The Novices at Sais&quot;
** This translation was originally published in 1949 and includes illustrations by Paul Klee.

===Fragments===
Together with Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis developed the fragment as a literary artform in German. For Schlegel, the fragment served as a literary vehicle that mediated apparent oppositions. Its model was the fragment from classical sculpture, whose part evoked the whole, or whose finitude evoked infinite possibility, via the imagination. The use of the fragment allowed Novalis to easily express himself on any issue of intellectual life he wanted to address, and it served as a means of expressing Schlegel&#x27;s ideal of a universal &quot;progressive universal poesy&quot;, that fused &quot;poetry and prose into an art that expressed the totality of both art and nature&quot;. This genre particularly suited Novalis as it allowed him to express himself in a way that kept both philosophy and poetry in a continuous relationship. His first major use of the fragment as a literary form, &quot;Pollen&quot;, was published in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; in 1798. English translations include:
*&quot;Pollen&quot;
** This and subsequent wikisource references are translations from This version of &quot;Pollen&quot; is the one published in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; in 1798, which was edited by Schlegel. and includes four of Schlegel&#x27;s fragments in fine print.
** This version is translated from Novalis&#x27;s unpublished original manuscript.

===Political writings===

During his lifetime, Novalis wrote two works on political themes, &quot;Faith and Love or the King and the Queen&quot; and his speech &quot;Europa&quot;, which was posthumously named &quot;Christianity or Europe&quot;. In addition to their political focus, both works share a common theme of poetically arguing for the importance of &quot;faith and love&quot; to achieve human and communal unification. Because these works poetically address political concerns, their meaning continues to be the subject of disagreement. Their interpretations have ranged from being seen as reactionary manifestos celebrating hierarchies to utopian dreams of human solidarity.

&quot;Faith and Love or the King and the Queen&quot; was published in &quot;Yearbooks of the Prussian Monarchy&quot; in 1798 just after King Wilhelm Frederick III and his popular wife Queen Louise ascended to the throne of Prussia. In this work, Novalis addresses the king and queen, emphasizing their importance as role models for creating an enduring state of interconnectedness both on the individual and collective level. Though a substantial portion of the essay was published, Frederick Wilhelm III censored the publication of additional installments as he felt it held the monarchy to impossibly high standards. The work is also notable in that Novalis extensively used the literary fragment to make his points.

&quot;Europa&quot; was written and originally delivered to a private group of friends in 1799. It was intended for the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;; after it was presented, Schlegel decided not to publish it. It was not published in full until 1826. It is a poetical, cultural-historical speech with a focus on a political utopia with regard to the Middle Ages. In this text Novalis tries to develop a new Europe which is based on a new poetical Christendom which shall lead to unity and freedom. He got the inspiration for this text from a book written by Schleiermacher, &quot;Über die Religion&quot; (&quot;On Religion&quot;). The work was a response to the French Revolution and its implications for the French enlightenment, which Novalis saw as catastrophic. It anticipated the growing German and Romantic critiques of the then-current enlightenment ideologies in the search for a new European spirituality and unity. Below are some available English translations, as well as two excerpts that illustrate how &quot;Europa&quot; has variously been interpreted.
* &quot;Faith and Love or the King and the Queen&quot;

===Collected works (in German)===
Novalis&#x27;s works were originally issued in two volumes by his friends Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel (2 vols. 1802; a third volume was added in 1846). Editions of Novalis&#x27;s collected works have since been compiled by C. Meisner and Bruno Wille (1898), by Ernst Heilborn (3 vols., 1901), and by J. Minor (4 vols., 1907). &quot;Heinrich von Ofterdingen&quot; was published separately by J. Schmidt in 1876. The most current version of Novalis&#x27;s collected works, a German-language, six-volume edition of Novalis works &quot;Historische-Kritische Ausgabe - Novalis Schriften&quot; (HKA), is edited by Richard Samuel, Hans-Joachim Mähl &amp; Gerhard Schulz. It is published by Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1960–2006.

Novalis&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence&quot; was edited by J. M. Raich in 1880. See R. Haym &quot;Die romantische Schule&quot; (Berlin, 1870); A. Schubart, &quot;Novalis&#x27; Leben, Dichten und Denken&quot; (1887); C. Busse, &quot;Novalis&#x27; Lyrik&quot; (1898); J. Bing, &quot;Friedrich von Hardenberg&quot; (Hamburg, 1899), E.

==Influence==
The political philosopher Karl Marx&#x27;s metaphorical argument that religion was the opium of the people was prefigured by Novalis&#x27;s statement in &quot;Pollen&quot; where he describes &quot;philistines&quot; with the following analogy, &quot;Their so-called religion works just like an opiate: stimulating, sedating, stilling pain through innervation&quot;. 

Hungarian philosopher György Lukács derived his concept of philosophy as transcendental homelessness from Novalis. In his 1914–15 essay &quot;Theory of the Novel&quot; quotes Novalis at the top of the essay, &quot;Philosophy is really homesickness—the desire to be everywhere at home.&quot; The essay unfolds closely related to this notion of Novalis—that modern philosophy &quot;mourns the absence of a pre-subjective, pre-reflexive anchoring of reason&quot; and is searching to be grounded but cannot achieve this aim due to philosophy&#x27;s modern discursive nature. Later, however, Lukács repudiated Romanticism, writing that Novalis&#x27;s &quot;cult of the immediate and the unconscious necessarily leads to a cult of night and death, of sickness and decay.&quot;

The musical composer Richard Wagner&#x27;s libretto for the opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; contains strong allusions to Novalis&#x27;s symbolic language, especially the dichotomy between the Night and the Day that animates his &quot;Hymns to the Night.&quot;

The literary critic Walter Pater includes Novalis&#x27;s quote, &quot;Philosophiren ist dephlegmatisiren, vivificiren&quot; (&quot;to philosophize is to throw off apathy, to become revived&quot;) in his conclusion to &quot;Studies in the History of the Renaissance&quot;.

The esotericist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner spoke in various lectures (now published) about Novalis and his influence on anthroposophy.

The literary critic, philosopher and photographer&#x27;s Franz Roh term &quot;magischer Realismus&quot; that he coined in his 1925 book &quot;Nach-Expressionismus, Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europäischen Malerei&quot; (&quot;Post-expressionism, Magic Realism: Problems in Recent European Painting&quot;) may have been inspired by Novalis&#x27;s term &quot;magischer Realist&quot;.

André Breton and the Surrealists were greatly influenced by Novalis. Breton cited Novalis extensively in his study of art history, &quot;L&#x27;Art Magique&quot;, as well.

The 20th-century philosopher Martin Heidegger uses a Novalis fragment, &quot;Philosophy is really homesickness, an urge to be at home everywhere&quot; in the opening pages of &quot;The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics&quot;.

The UK Charity &quot;Novalis Trust&quot; which provides care and education for individuals with additional needs.

The author Hermann Hesse&#x27;s writing was influenced by Novalis&#x27;s poetry, and Hesse&#x27;s last full-length novel &quot;Glasperlenspiel&quot; (&quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot;) contains a passage that appears to restate one of the fragments in Novalis&#x27;s &quot;Pollen&quot;.

The artist and activist Joseph Beuys&#x27;s aphorism &quot;Everyone is an artist&quot; was inspired by Novalis, who wrote &quot;Every person should be an artist&quot; in &quot;Faith and Love or the King and the Queen&quot;.

The author Jorge Luis Borges refers often to Novalis in his work.

The krautrock band Novalis took their name from Novalis and used his poems for lyrics on their albums.

Novalis records, which are produced by AVC Audio Visual Communications AG, Switzerland, was named in tribute to Novalis&#x27;s writings.

The avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage made the short film &quot;First Hymn to the Night – Novalis&quot; in 1994. The film, which visually incorporates the text of Novalis&#x27;s poem, was issued on Blu-ray and DVD in an anthology of Brakhage&#x27;s films by Criterion Collection.

The artist and animator Chris Powell created the award-winning animated film &quot;Novalis&quot;. The title character is a robot named after Novalis.

Novalis has also influenced film theory by way of Jacques Rancière, who employs various elements of German Idealism and Romanticism in his philosophical work on critical philosophy and the regimes of art.

The composer, guitarist, and electronic music artist Erik Wøllo titled one of his songs &quot;Novalis&quot;.

Penelope Fitzgerald based her historical novel &quot;The Blue Flower&quot; on Novalis&#x27;s love affair with Sophie and her influence on his art.

<text>Cosimo di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (27 September 1389 – 1 August 1464) was an Italian banker and politician who established the Medici family as effective rulers of Florence during much of the Italian Renaissance. His power derived from his wealth as a banker and intermarriage with other rich and powerful families. He was a patron of arts, learning, and architecture. He spent over 600,000 gold florins (approx. $500 million inflation adjusted) on art and culture, including Donatello&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;, the first freestanding nude male sculpture since antiquity. 

Despite his influence, his power was not absolute; he was viewed by fellow Florentine politicians as first among equals rather than an autocrat. Florence&#x27;s legislative councils resisted his proposals throughout his political career, even sending him into exile from 1433 to 1434.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and family business ===
Cosimo de&#x27; Medici was born in Florence to Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici and his wife Piccarda Bueri on 27 September 1389. At the time, it was customary to indicate the name of one&#x27;s father in one&#x27;s name for the purpose of distinguishing the identities of two like-named individuals; thus, Giovanni was the son of Bicci, and Cosimo&#x27;s name was properly rendered Cosimo di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici. He was born along with a twin brother Damiano, who survived only a short time. The twins were named after Saints Cosmas and Damian, whose feast day was then celebrated on 27 September; Cosimo would later celebrate his own birthday on that day, his &quot;name day&quot;, rather than on the actual date of his birth. Cosimo also had a brother Lorenzo, known as &quot;Lorenzo the Elder&quot;, who was some six years younger and participated in the family&#x27;s banking enterprise.

Cosimo inherited both his wealth and his expertise in banking from his father Giovanni, who had gone from being a moneylender to join the bank of his relative Vieri di Cambio de&#x27; Medici. Giovanni had been running Vieri&#x27;s branch in Rome independently since the dissolution of the latter&#x27;s bank into three separate and independent entities until 1397, when he left Rome to return to Florence to found his own bank, the Medici Bank. Over the next two decades, the Medici Bank opened branches in Rome, Geneva, Venice, and temporarily in Naples; the majority of profits was derived from Rome. The branch manager in Rome was a papal &quot;depositario generale&quot; who managed Church finances in return for a commission. Cosimo would later expand the bank throughout western Europe and opened offices in London, Pisa, Avignon, Bruges, Milan, and Lübeck. The far-flung branches of the Medici rendered it the best bank for the business of the papacy, since it enabled bishoprics in many parts of Europe to pay their fees into the nearest branch, whose manager would then issue a papal license, and the popes could more easily order a variety of wares – such as spices, textiles, and relics – through the bankers&#x27; wholesale trade. In fifteen years, Giovanni would make a profit of 290,791 florins.

In 1415, Cosimo allegedly accompanied the Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance. In 1410, Giovanni lent John XXIII, then simply known as Baldassare Cossa, the money to buy himself the office of cardinal, which he repaid by making the Medici Bank head of all papal finances once he claimed the papacy. This gave the Medici family tremendous power, allowing them, for instance, to threaten defaulting debtors with excommunication. But misfortune hit the Medici Bank in 1415, when the Council of Constance unseated John XXIII, thus taking away the near monopoly they had held on the finances of the Roman Curia; thereafter, the Medici Bank had to compete with other banks. However, after the Spini Bank of Florence went insolvent in 1420, they again secured priority. John XXIII, facing the enmity of a church council at which he was accused of a large variety of offenses against the Church, was confined by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor to Heidelberg Castle until the Medici paid his ransom and granted him asylum.
In the same year as John&#x27;s dethronement (1415), Cosimo was named a &quot;Priore [&quot;it&quot;] of the Republic [of Florence]&quot;. Later he acted frequently as an ambassador for Florence and demonstrated a prudence for which he became renowned.

About 1415, Cosimo married Contessina de&#x27; Bardi (the daughter of Alessandro di Sozzo Bardi, count of Vernio, and Camilla Pannocchieschi). The wedding was arranged by his father as an effort to reaffirm relations with the long-standing noble Bardi family, who had operated one of the richest banks in Europe until its spectacular collapse in 1345; they nevertheless remained highly influential in the financial sphere. Only part of the Bardi family were involved in this marriage alliance, for some of the branches considered themselves the opponents of the Medici clan. The couple had two sons: Piero the Gouty (b. 1416) and Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (b. 1421). Cosimo also had an illegitimate son, Carlo, by a Circassian slave, who would go on to become a prelate.

Giovanni withdrew from the Medici Bank in 1420, leaving its leadership to both of his surviving sons. He left them 179,221 florins upon his death in 1429. Two-thirds of this came from the business in Rome, while only a tenth came from Florence; even Venice offered better returns than Florence. The brothers would earn two-thirds of the profits from the bank, with the other third going to a partner. Besides the bank, the family owned much land in the area surrounding Florence, including Mugello, the place from which the family originally came.

=== Florentine politics ===

Cosimo&#x27;s power over Florence stemmed from his wealth, which he used to control the votes of office holders in the municipal councils, most importantly the Signoria of Florence. As Florence was proud of its &quot;democracy&quot;, he pretended to have little political ambition and did not often hold public office. Enea Silvio Piccolomini, Bishop of Siena and later Pope Pius II, said of him:

In 1433, Cosimo&#x27;s power over Florence began to look like a menace to the anti-Medici party led by figures such as Palla Strozzi and the Albizzi family, headed by Rinaldo degli Albizzi. In September of that year, Cosimo was imprisoned in the Palazzo Vecchio for his part in the failure in 1429-30 to conquer the Republic of Lucca, but he managed to turn the jail term into one of exile. Some prominent Florentines, such as Francesco Filelfo, demanded his execution, a fate that may have been almost certain without the intervention of the monk Ambrogio Traversari on his behalf. Cosimo travelled to Padua and then to Venice, taking his bank along with him and finding friends and sympathizers wherever he went for his willingness to accept exile rather than resume the bloody conflicts that had chronically afflicted the streets of Florence. Venice sent an envoy to Florence on his behalf and requested that they rescind the order of banishment. When they refused, Cosimo settled down in Venice, his brother Lorenzo accompanying him. However, prompted by his influence and his money, others followed him, such as the architect Michelozzo, whom Cosimo commissioned to design a library as a gift to the Venetian people. Within a year, the flight of capital from Florence was so great that the decree of exile had to be lifted. Cosimo returned a year later, in 1434, to influence the government of Florence (especially through the Pitti and Soderini families) for the last 30 years of his life of 75 years.

Cosimo&#x27;s time in exile instilled in him the need to quash the factionalism that resulted in his exile in the first place. In order to do this, he instigated a series of constitutional changes with the help of favourable priors in the Signoria to secure his power through influence.

Following the death of Filippo Maria Visconti, who had ruled the Duchy of Milan from 1412 until his death in 1447, Cosimo sent Francesco I Sforza to establish himself in Milan to prevent an impending military advance from the Republic of Venice. Francesco Sforza was a &quot;condottiere&quot;, a mercenary soldier who had stolen land from the papacy and proclaimed himself its lord. He had yearned to establish himself at Milan as well, an ambition that was aided by the fact that the current Visconti head lacked legitimate children save for a daughter, Bianca, whom Sforza ultimately married in November 1441 after a failed attempt at winning her hand from her father. The resultant balance of power with Milan and Florence on the one side and Venice and the Kingdom of Naples on the other created nearly half a century of peace that enabled the development of the Renaissance in Italy. However, despite the benefits to Florence from keeping Venice at bay, the intervention in Milan was unpopular among Cosimo&#x27;s fellow citizens, primarily because they were called upon to finance the Sforza succession. The Milanese made a brief attempt at democracy before Sforza was finally acclaimed duke by the city in February 1450.

In terms of foreign policy, Cosimo worked to create peace in northern Italy through the creation of a balance of power between Florence, Naples, Venice and Milan during the wars in Lombardy between 1423 and 1454 and the discouragement of outside powers (notably the French and the Holy Roman Empire) from interfering in Italian affairs. In 1439, he was instrumental in convincing Pope Eugene IV to move the Ecumenical Council of Ferrara to Florence. The arrival of many notable Byzantine figures from the Eastern Roman Empire, including Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, for this event further inspired the growing interest in ancient Greek arts and literature.

=== Death ===

On his death in 1464 at Careggi, Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero, father of Lorenzo the Magnificent. After Cosimo&#x27;s death, the Signoria awarded him the title &quot;Pater Patriae&quot;, &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot;, an honour once awarded to Cicero, and had it carved upon his tomb in the Church of San Lorenzo.

== Patronage ==
Cosimo de&#x27; Medici used his personal fortune to control the Florentine political system and to sponsor orators, poets and philosophers, as well as a series of artistic accomplishments.

=== Arts ===

Cosimo was also noted for his patronage of culture and the arts during the Renaissance and spent the family fortune liberally to enrich the civic life of Florence. According to Salviati&#x27;s &quot;Zibaldone&quot;, Cosimo stated: &quot;All those things have given me the greatest satisfaction and contentment because they are not only for the honour of God but are likewise for my own remembrance. For fifty years, I have done nothing else but earn money and spend money; and it became clear that spending money gives me greater pleasure than earning it.&quot;
Additionally, his patronage of the arts both recognized and proclaimed the humanistic responsibility of the civic duty that came with wealth.

Cosimo hired the young Michelozzo Michelozzi to create what is today perhaps the prototypical Florentine palazzo, the austere and magnificent Palazzo Medici. The building still includes, as its only 15th-century interior that is largely intact, the Magi Chapel frescoed by Benozzo Gozzoli, completed in 1461 with portraits of members of the Medici family parading through Tuscany in the guise of the Three Wise Men. He was a patron and confidante of Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, and Donatello, whose famed David and Judith Slaying Holofernes were Medici commissions. His patronage enabled the eccentric and bankrupt architect Brunelleschi to complete the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore (the &quot;Duomo&quot;) in 1436.
=== Libraries ===
In 1444, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici founded the first public library in Florence, at San Marco, which was of central importance to the humanist movement in Florence during the Renaissance. It was designed by Michelozzo, a student of Lorenzo Ghiberti who later collaborated with Donatello and was also a good friend and patron to Cosimo. Cosimo contributed the funds necessary to repair the library and provide it with a book collection, which people were allowed to use at no charge. &quot;That Cosimo de&#x27;Medici was able to finance the construction of such a site placed him in a privileged position of leadership in the city. He hand-selected those individuals who were given access to this laboratory of learning, and, through this social dynamic, he actively shaped the politics of the Republic.&quot; He also commissioned Michelozzo to design a library for his grandson, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. His first library, however, was designed by Michelozzo while the two were in Venice, where Cosimo had been temporarily exiled. In 1433, in gratitude for the hospitality of that city, he left it as a gift, his only such work outside Florence. His libraries were noted for their Renaissance style of architecture and distinguished artwork.

Cosimo had grown up with only three books, but by the time he was thirty, his collection had grown to 70 volumes. After being introduced to humanism by a group of literati who had asked for his help in preserving books, he grew to love the movement and gladly sponsored the effort to renew Greek and Roman civilization through literature, for which book collecting was a central activity. &quot;Heartened by the romantic wanderlust of a true bibliophile, the austere banker even embarked on several journeys in the hunt for books, while guaranteeing just about any undertaking that involved books. He financed trips to nearly every European town as well as to Syria, Egypt, and Greece organized by Poggio Bracciolini, his chief book scout.&quot; He engaged 45 copyists under the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci to transcribe manuscripts and paid off the debts of Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli after his death in exchange for control over his collection of some 800 manuscripts valued at around 6,000 florins. These manuscripts that Cosimo acquired from Niccoli would later be the cornerstone of the Laurentian Library, a library in Florence founded by Cosimo&#x27;s grandson, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici.

=== Philosophy ===
In the realm of philosophy, Cosimo, influenced by the lectures of Gemistus Plethon, supported Marsilio Ficino and his attempts at reviving Neo-Platonism. Cosimo commissioned Ficino&#x27;s Latin translation of the complete works of Plato (the first ever complete translation) and collected a vast library that he shared with intellectuals such as Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli and Leonardo Bruni. He also established a Platonic Academy in Florence in 1445. He provided his grandson Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici with an education in the studia humanitatis. Cosimo certainly had an influence on Renaissance intellectual life, but it was Lorenzo who would later be deemed to have been the greatest patron.

== Fictional depictions ==
Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s three-part television miniseries &quot;The Age of the Medici&quot; (1973) has Cosimo as its central character (the original Italian title is &quot;L&#x27;età di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici&quot;, meaning &quot;The Age of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici&quot;). The first part, &quot;The Exile of Cosimo&quot;, and the second part, &quot;The Power of Cosimo&quot;, focus on Cosimo&#x27;s political struggles and on his patronage of the arts and sciences in Florence. Cosimo is portrayed by Italian actor Marcello Di Falco.

Frank Spotnitz&#x27;s eight-part television series &quot;Medici: Masters of Florence&quot; (2016) depicts the rise of the powerful banking family after the death of Giovanni (played by Dustin Hoffman), as his son Cosimo (Richard Madden) takes over as head of the family. The sixteen-part sequel, &quot;Medici&quot; (2019–2020), follows the career of Cosimo&#x27;s grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent (Daniel Sharman).

<doc id="214877" wikidata="Q5589682" url="?curid=214877" title="Governor of Minnesota">
<text>The governor of Minnesota is the head of government of the U.S. state of Minnesota, leading the state&#x27;s executive branch. Forty people have been governor of Minnesota, though historically there were also three governors of Minnesota Territory. Alexander Ramsey, the first territorial governor, also served as state governor several years later. State governors are elected to office by popular vote, but territorial governors were appointed to the office by the United States president. The current governor of Minnesota is Tim Walz of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), affiliated with the national Democratic Party.

==Powers and qualifications==
Similar to the U.S. president, the governor has veto power over bills passed by the Minnesota State Legislature. As in most states, but unlike the U.S. president, the governor can also make line-item vetoes, where specific provisions in bills can be stripped out while allowing the overall bill to be signed into law.

The governor of Minnesota must be 25 years old upon assuming office, and must have been a Minnesota resident for one year before the election.

Since a 1958 amendment to the Minnesota Constitution, governors are elected to four-year terms, with no limits on the number of terms they may serve.

==Cabinet==

The governor has a cabinet consisting of the leaders of various state departments. The governor appoints these department heads, who, other than the head of the Department of Military Affairs and the chairs of the Metropolitan Council and the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, are called commissioners. Cabinet members include:

==Residence==

The Minnesota Governor&#x27;s Residence is located in Saint Paul, at 1006 Summit Avenue.

==Succession==

The line of succession for the Governor is established by Article V, Section 5 of the Minnesota Constitution and Minnesota Statute 4.06.

==Traditions==
===Minnesota Governor&#x27;s Fishing Opener===
The Minnesota Governor&#x27;s Fishing Opener is a tradition that dates back to 1948. The event was designed to promote the development of Minnesota&#x27;s recreation industry. The Governor goes to a selected lake in Minnesota to fish on the opening weekend of the fishing season.

<doc id="214880" wikidata="Q575881" url="?curid=214880" title="Ian Paisley Jr">
<text>Ian Richard Kyle Paisley Jr (born 12 December 1966) is a former unionist politician from Northern Ireland. A member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), he served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Antrim from 2010 to 2024, and was previously a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for North Antrim from 1998 to 2010. Paisley is the DUP&#x27;s Spokesperson for Digital, Culture, Media and Sports. He is a son of the DUP&#x27;s founder Ian Paisley.

==Childhood==
Born in Belfast in 1966, Paisley is the youngest child of the Reverend Ian Paisley and his wife Eileen Paisley, Baroness Paisley of St George&#x27;s. The younger Ian, along with his twin brother (Kyle) and his three elder sisters (Sharon, Rhonda and Cherith), was brought up in a large detached house on Cyprus Avenue in east Belfast. Being the younger of the twins, he was named after his father who was the younger of two brothers. He regularly attended the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster (where his father preached) from a very young age. In August 2007, he was the subject of the third episode of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The House I Grew Up In&quot; in which he talked about a happy childhood and secure family life, despite the Troubles.

==Education==
After leaving primary school, Paisley was educated at Shaftesbury House College, and then in the sixth form at Methodist College Belfast, before gaining admission to Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. There he gained a BA (Hons) in Modern History followed by a MSSc in Irish Politics. After finishing his postgraduate studies, he worked for his father as a political researcher and parliamentary aide.

== Political career ==
In 1996, Paisley was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum for North Antrim. He was returned for the constituency to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998. He is one of three DUP members who have taken their seats on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and is also the party&#x27;s justice spokesman and press officer.

Paisley successfully ran to succeed his father as the MP for North Antrim in the 2010 UK general election, winning 46.4% of the vote share. Upon his election as MP, he resigned his seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly.

Although there were rumours that Paisley Jr was positioning himself to become leader of his party, he denies any such ambition: &quot;I&#x27;ve no ambition for that at all. I&#x27;ve never had any ambition to get anywhere beyond where I am today. Some people sought to put the knife in, in order to stop me, because they were concerned about me wanting to be leader. Well, they misjudged me completely.&quot;

In 2022, Paisley introduced a private members&#x27; bill that proposed to alter how future referendums on constitutional change, and thus Northern Ireland&#x27;s ability to leave the United Kingdom, would be ratified. Paisley&#x27;s bill would have changed the law so that a simple majority vote would no longer be enough for reunification with Ireland, and instead a higher bar of a supermajority would be required for an affirmative result to be declared. However, Paisley&#x27;s actions were ridiculed by fellow Northern Irish MP&#x27;s Stephen Farry and Claire Hanna, who both described it as a political stunt and highlighted that it would never be debated by or voted upon by the UK Parliament.

Paisley failed to win re-election in the 2024 UK general election after Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister overturned a near 13,000 vote DUP majority to be elected as MP for the constituency of North Antrim. He is no longer serving in frontline politics.

===Expenses===
For the 2011–12 financial year, Paisley&#x27;s total expenses claim was the seventh-highest of all members of parliament. His expenses for the 2012–13 financial year were £232,000; the highest of any MP that year. The costs covered travel and accommodation for Paisley himself and his constituency staff. In an interview with the &quot;Ballymena Times&quot;, Paisley stated &quot;None of this money goes to me as MP ... They are legitimate expenses signed off by IPSA and paid directly by the Parliament&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Telegraph - 2012/13 expenses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He had the second-highest expenses claim in the 2013–14 financial year. For the 2014–15 financial year, he was again the second-highest claimant, receiving £227,000 in expenses. During the 2010–2015 Parliament, Paisley claimed a total of £1,112,667 in expenses.

===Brexit===
Paisley strongly supported &quot;Vote Leave&quot; in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and was a supporter of the Eurosceptic campaign Leave Means Leave. 
While rejecting calls by Republican party Sinn Féin for a referendum in Northern Ireland on a unified Ireland, he advised his constituents to get an Irish passport if they were eligible.

=== Paid advocacy and recall petition ===

In 2018 Paisley was suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days, beginning on 4 September 2018, because he broke paid advocacy rules by receiving hospitality from the Sri Lankan government without declaring that to the Commons. Following his suspension, the Recall of MPs Act 2015 was invoked for the first time since it received Royal Assent. However, the resulting recall petition—the first in British parliamentary history—was signed by only 9.4% of registered voters, below the 10% threshold to trigger a by-election. Paisley&#x27;s membership of the DUP was suspended between 24 July and 18 September 2018, during internal investigations by the party into his conduct.

===Electoral Commission fine===
In September 2020, Paisley was fined £1,300 (€1,400) by the Electoral Commission for accepting a total of £2,600 from two local councils to purchase tables at a fund-raising event at the Tullyglass hotel in Ballymena in September 2017. Paisley also agreed to pay back the money.

=== Association with Jo Bamford ===
In 2019, Paisley helped JCB heir Jo Bamford purchase Wrightbus, the financially troubled manufacturer of London&#x27;s famous double-decker buses. Jeff Wright, then-owner of Wrightbus, publicly complained of Paisley&#x27;s alleged interference into the negotiations of the sale of Wrightbus to Bamford. Once the purchase was complete, Bamford publicly praised Paisley for his help.

On 12 October 2019 Paisley wrote an op-ed in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; in which he praised Bamford and thanked him for buying Wrightbus.

== Controversy ==

===Loyalist Volunteer Force rally===
In March 1998, Paisley and Sammy Wilson spoke at a rally in Portadown organised by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in opposition to political negotiations preceding the Good Friday Agreement. Their appearance was widely criticised; the rally came hours after the funeral for two men murdered by the LVF, Philip Allen and Damien Trainor – one a Protestant, one a Catholic – in a bar in Poyntzpass, County Armagh, in an indiscriminate sectarian attack. At the rally, Paisley told followers of the late LVF leader Billy Wright &quot;...the sooner this government wakes up to the reality that you can&#x27;t talk to the Provisional IRA to get peace - the only way to get peace out of the Provisional IRA is to exterminate them, put them out of business&quot;.

===Views on homosexuality===
In 2005, Paisley came under some criticism for his beliefs about homosexuality and same-sex marriages. Upon learning that David Trimble&#x27;s aide, Steven King, had married his partner in Canada, Paisley was quoted as saying, &quot;It is really astounding that David Trimble should have had a man such as this giving him advice – and must surely cast grave doubts on his own political judgement. I think these sorts of relationships are immoral, offensive and obnoxious.&quot;

Paisley caused further controversy in May 2007 when, in an interview with journalist Jason O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine, he said that &quot;I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. I think it is wrong. I think that those people harm themselves and – without caring about it – harm society. That doesn&#x27;t mean to say that I hate them – I mean, I hate what they do.&quot;

In 2011, Paisley said of his previous comments: &quot;I think I have grown up since then. I have strong Christian beliefs and moral viewpoints, but you have to realise that while sin is black and white, life is a lot of grey. You have to be mature about these things. I can strongly disagree with those viewpoints, but the point is how you disagree.&quot;

===University graduation===
Paisley was unable to graduate from his MSSc in the summer graduation period, due to having exceeded the word count on his dissertation, and instead graduated in the winter period of 1994. The summer of 1994 was the last year Queen&#x27;s University Belfast played the British national anthem; Paisley responded by playing the anthem on a tape recorder during his winter graduation.

===Property developers===
Paisley had been linked in press reports to local property developer Seymour Sweeney when, in 2007, Sweeney admitted that Paisley had lobbied on his behalf regarding plans for a private visitors&#x27; centre at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in Northern Ireland. Paisley strongly denied that he had any financial relationship with Sweeney, although he admitted that he had gone deep sea fishing with the developer socially.

Paisley had been involved in the commercial development of the north Antrim coast and strongly supported Alistair Hanna&#x27;s controversial Bushmills Dunes Golf Resort and Spa proposal, an 18-hole golf course and hotel complex at Runkerry, adjacent to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. There were a series of public blunders and further controversy in February 2008, following scrutiny on the employment of family members by politicians after the Derek Conway scandal, when it emerged that Paisley was on his father&#x27;s payroll as a researcher in the constituency of North Antrim in addition to his roles as an MLA and a junior minister. As a result, Paisley resigned his junior minister position on 18 February 2008.

===Dissident republican comments===
Further controversy occurred in August 2008 when Paisley, speaking after a number of attacks on the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said that dissident republicans should be &quot;shot on sight&quot;.

=== 2013 Sri Lankan hospitality, and lobbying for a foreign government ===
Paisley visited Sri Lanka twice in 2013, with members of his family; the first occasion was from 30 March until 5 April, and the second from 2 July until 11 July. In their family visa application submitted to the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, all six who travelled declared that the purpose of their visit to Sri Lanka was &quot;official&quot;.

In September 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that Paisley had received hospitality from the government of Sri Lanka for his two visits there in 2013 without declaring it. It also stated that in 2017 he had been involved in securing a post-Brexit trade deal with that country. However, Paisley replied that the claims were defamatory and that he had referred the matter to his solicitor.

In July 2018, the House of Commons Standards Committee recommended that Paisley be suspended from the Commons for thirty sitting days, for not declaring visits to Sri Lanka paid for by the Sri Lankan government and for breaking the Commons rule banning paid advocacy. The Committee concluded that Paisley&#x27;s actions amounted to serious misconduct and suggested that his failure to register his visits to Sri Lanka had occurred because he was conscious of the potential embarrassment that would be caused to him if it were to become publicly known that he had accepted very expensive hospitality, for himself and his family, from an overseas government accused of serious human rights violations.

On 24 July 2018, MPs voted to suspend Paisley from the House of Commons for a period of 30 sitting days, beginning on 4 September 2018. His salary was also to be withheld for 30 days. The DUP released a statement confirming that the party officers had decided to suspend him from the party until an internal investigation were held into his conduct. The Speaker of the House of Commons confirmed he would write to the Chief Electoral Officer in Northern Ireland to initiate the MP recall mechanisms, as specified in the Recall of MPs Act 2015. A recall petition opened on 8 August.

On 20 September 2018, the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland announced the recall petition had fallen 444 votes short of the number needed to spark a by-election. Following this result, the DUP announced that it had lifted Ian Paisley&#x27;s party suspension on 18 September, but had banned him from taking any party office for a year.

===Criticism of journalist===
In September 2019, following the publication of an analytical article written by journalist Sam McBride in the Belfast &quot;News Letter&quot;, concerning the DUP&#x27;s ongoing negotiations in Stormont, Paisley criticised McBride online, calling him &quot;despicable&quot;, &quot;immature&quot;, and &quot;simplistic&quot;. In response, the National Union of Journalists condemned the remarks as an &quot;unwarranted personal attack&quot; on the journalist. Following further criticism, Paisley apologised, stating that he &quot;expressed [himself] badly&quot;.

=== Maldives trip ===
In 2016, Paisley and his family took a holiday to a resort in the Maldives, a trip that he did not disclose as he was required to do. He took the trip months after advocating on behalf the Maldivian government. An investigation concluded that Paisley had failed to properly register the visit, and that his hospitality had likely not been paid for by a friend, as he had claimed. However, he was found not to have broken any rules on “paid advocacy.”

==Personal life==
In 1990, Paisley married Fiona Currie, and they have four children. He is a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.

<doc id="214883" wikidata="Q5589725" url="?curid=214883" title="Governor of Texas">
<text>The governor of Texas is the head of government of the U.S. state of Texas. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the government of Texas and is the commander-in-chief of the Texas Military Forces. 

Established in the Constitution of Texas, the governor&#x27;s responsibilities include ensuring the enforcement of state laws, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Texas Legislature, overseeing state agencies, issuing executive orders, proposing and overseeing the state budget, and making key appointments to state offices. The governor also has the power to call special sessions of the legislature and, with the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, grant pardons. 

The current governor of Texas is Republican Greg Abbott, who took office in 2015.

==Qualifications==
Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of Texas sets three qualifications for candidates for governor of Texas:
* Be at least 30 years old;
* Be a citizen of the United States;
* Be a resident of Texas for at least five years preceding the election.

== Election, oath of office and removal ==
Governors of Texas are directly elected by registered voters in Texas and serve terms of four years, with no term limits. Before executing the powers of the office, a governor is required to recite the oath of office as found in Article XVI, Section 1 of the Constitution of Texas:
I, _______________________, do solemnly swear (or affirm), that I will faithfully execute the duties of the office of governor of the State of Texas, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State, so help me God.
They take office on the third Tuesday of January following an election, which is also the date of expiry of the previous gubernatorial term.

=== Removal of a governor from office ===
The Texas governor can be impeached by the State House of Representatives for committing treason, bribery, or any other high crime or misdemeanor. Once the governor is impeached, the case is forwarded to the State Senate for trial. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to remove the governor from office. Unlike other states, Texas does not have a provision in the state constitution that allows voters to petition for a recall election to remove the governor.

==History==
The state&#x27;s first constitution in 1845 established the office of governor, to serve for two years, but no more than four years out of every six (essentially a limit of no more than two &quot;consecutive&quot; terms). The 1861 secessionist constitution set the term start date at the first Monday in the November following the election. The 1866 constitution, adopted just after the American Civil War, increased terms to 4 years, but no more than 8 years out of every 12, and moved the start date to the first Thursday after the organization of the legislature, or &quot;as soon thereafter as practicable&quot;. The Reconstruction-era constitution of 1869 removed the limit on terms, Texas remains one of 16 states, territory or jurisdiction (including the U.S. Territory of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) with no gubernatorial term limits. The present constitution of 1876 shortened terms back to two years, but a 1972 amendment increased it to four years again.

The gubernatorial election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November that does not coincide with the presidential elections. All gubernatorial elections have been a part of the midterm elections since the 1974 election, invalidating the latter. The governor is sworn in on the third Tuesday of January every four years along with the lieutenant governor, so Abbott and current lieutenant governor Dan Patrick both took office on January 20, 2015.

Despite the lack of term limits, no Texas governor in the 19th or 20th century ever served more than seven and a half consecutive years in office (Allan Shivers) or eight years total service (Bill Clements, in two non-consecutive four-year terms). Former governor Rick Perry, who served from 2000 to 2015, surpassed both these records, becoming the first Texas governor to serve three consecutive four-year terms. When Perry won the general election on November 2, 2010, he joined Shivers, Price Daniel, and John Connally as the only Texas governors elected to three terms (the terms served by governors Shivers, Daniel, and Connally were two-year terms). On November 8, 2022, current governor Greg Abbott was re-elected and became the fifth Texas governor to serve three terms following Shivers, Daniel, Connally and Perry. In case of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This rule was added only in a 1999 amendment, prior to which the lieutenant governor only acted as governor, except during the time of the 1861 constitution, which said that the lieutenant governor would be styled &quot;Governor of the State of Texas&quot; in case of vacancy.

== Official residence and workplace ==
The official residence of the Texas governor is the Texas Governor&#x27;s Mansion, in Austin. The mansion was built in 1854 and has been the home of every governor since 1856. It is also one of the official workplaces for the governor.

The governor&#x27;s primary official workplace is located within the Texas State Capitol in Austin.

== Timeline of governors of Texas ==

The following timeline depicts the progression of the governors of Texas and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.
== Line of succession ==

The governor of Texas line of succession is set by Article IV, Sections 3a and 16–18 of the Constitution of Texas and Chapter 401.023 of Title 4 the Texas Gov&#x27;t Code.

<doc id="214884" wikidata="Q3112728" url="?curid=214884" title="Governor of New Jersey">
<text>The governor of New Jersey is the head of government of the U.S. state of New Jersey. The office of governor is an elected position with a four-year term. There is a two consecutive term limit, with no limitation on non-consecutive terms. The official residence of the governor is Drumthwacket, a mansion located in Princeton, New Jersey. The governor&#x27;s office is located inside the New Jersey State House in Trenton, making New Jersey unique in having the executive&#x27;s office is located in the same building as the legislature. New Jersey is also notable as one of the few states in which the governor&#x27;s official residence is not located in the state capital.

The first and longest-serving governor of New Jersey was William Livingston, who served from August 31, 1776, to July 25, 1790. A. Harry Moore remains the longest-serving popularly elected governor. The current and 56th governor is Phil Murphy, a Democrat who assumed office on January 16, 2018.

==Role==
The governor is directly elected by the voters to become the political and ceremonial head of the state. The governor performs the executive functions of the state and is not directly subordinate to the federal authorities. The governor assumes additional roles, such as being the commander-in-chief of the New Jersey National Guard forces (when they are not federalized).

Unlike many other states that have elections for some cabinet-level positions, under the New Jersey Constitution the governor and lieutenant governor are the only officials elected on a statewide basis. Much like the president of the United States, the governor appoints the entire cabinet, subject to confirmation by the New Jersey Senate. More importantly, under the New Jersey constitution, the governor appoints all superior court judges and county prosecutors, although this is done with strong consideration of the preferences of the individual state senators who represent the district where vacancies arise. The governor is also responsible for appointing two constitutionally created officers, the New Jersey attorney general and the secretary of state of New Jersey, with the approval of the Senate.

As amended in January 2002, state law allows for a maximum salary of $175,000. Phil Murphy has stated that he will accept the full salary. Jon Corzine accepted a token salary of $1 per year as governor. Previous governor Jim McGreevey received an annual salary of $157,000, a 10% reduction of the maximum allowed, while Chris Christie, Murphy&#x27;s immediate predecessor, accepted the full gubernatorial salary.

The governor has a full-time protective security detail from the Executive Protection Unit of the New Jersey State Police while in office. A former governor is entitled to a one-person security detail from the New Jersey State Police for up to six months after leaving office.

==Oath of office==
&quot;I, [name of governor], elected governor of the state of New Jersey, do solemnly promise and swear that I will diligently, faithfully and to the best of my knowledge, execute the said office in conformity with the powers delegated to me; and that I will to the utmost of my skill and ability, promote the peace and prosperity and maintain the lawful rights of the said state. So help me God.&quot;

==Lieutenant governor==

On November 8, 2005, voters passed an amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution that created the position of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey, effective with the 2009 elections. Before this amendment was passed, the President of the New Jersey Senate would simultaneously also serve as governor whenever the office of governor was vacant. This dual position was more powerful than that of an elected governor, as the individual would have a major role in both the legislative and executive branches.

The amendment was prompted by New Jersey State Senate President Richard Codey serving as Governor of New Jersey in January 2002 and again from November 2004 to January 2006 after the resignations of elected Governors Christine Todd Whitman and Jim McGreevey.

Kim Guadagno, a former prosecutor, was sworn in as New Jersey&#x27;s first lieutenant governor on January 19, 2010, under Governor Chris Christie. Guadagno was succeeded by former assemblywoman Sheila Oliver, who was sworn in on January 16, 2018, under Governor Phil Murphy. On August 1, 2023, the lieutenant governor position became vacant on August 1, 2023, when Oliver died in office. On September 8, 2023, Governor Murphy selected Tahesha Way, New Jersey&#x27;s Secretary of State, as the third lieutenant governor of New Jersey, to succeed Oliver and serve out the remainder of Oliver&#x27;s term.

==Center on the American Governor==
In 2005, the Center on the American Governor was established at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University to study the governors of New Jersey and, to a lesser degree, the governors of other states. The program features extensive archives of documents and pictures from the Byrne, Kean, Florio, Whitman, and Corzine administrations, video interviews with many members of the respective administrations, information on other American governors, and news updates on all fifty current governors.

<text>Edsel Bryant Ford (November 6, 1893 – May 26, 1943) was an American business executive and philanthropist who was the only child of pioneering industrialist Henry Ford and his wife, Clara Jane Bryant Ford. He was the president of Ford Motor Company from 1919 until his death in 1943.

He worked closely with his father, as sole heir to the business, but was keen to develop cars more exciting than the Model T (&quot;Tin Lizzie&quot;), in line with his personal tastes. Even as president, he had trouble persuading his father to allow any departure from this formula. Only a change in market conditions enabled him to develop the more fashionable Model A in 1927. Edsel also founded the Mercury division and was responsible for the Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln Continental. He introduced important features, such as hydraulic brakes, and greatly strengthened the company&#x27;s overseas production.

Ford was a major art benefactor in Detroit and also financed Admiral Richard Byrd&#x27;s polar explorations. He died of stomach cancer aged 49. Henry Ford temporarily reassumed the presidency of Ford on Edsel&#x27;s death, then Edsel&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Ford II, succeeded Henry as president of Ford in 1945.

He was also a member of the board of directors of American IG, the American subsidiary of the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben.

==Life and career==
Edsel Ford was born in November 1893 in Detroit. He was the only child of Clara and Henry Ford, and was named after Edsel Ruddiman, one of Henry Ford&#x27;s closest childhood friends.

He was groomed to take over the family automobile business, and grew up tinkering on cars with his father. He became secretary of Ford in 1915, and married Eleanor Lowthian Clay (1896–1976), the niece of department store owner J. L. Hudson, on November 1, 1916. Together, they had four children: Henry Ford II (1917–1987), Benson Ford (1919–1978), Josephine Clay Ford (1923–2005), and William Clay Ford (1925–2014). They made their home at 2171 Iroquois Street, in the Indian Village neighborhood of Detroit.

Ford went to the Hotchkiss School, in Lakeville, Connecticut, and the Detroit University School. His family donated to both institutions. The school library at Hotchkiss is named the Edsel Ford Memorial Library.

The younger Ford showed more interest than his father in flashier styling for automobiles. He indulged this proclivity in part with the purchase of the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922. His affinity for sports cars was demonstrated in his personal vehicles: Edsel bought the first MG motorcar imported to the US. In 1932, he had an aluminum, boat-tailed speedster automobile custom-designed by Ford&#x27;s first designer, E. T. (Bob) Gregorie and featuring Ford&#x27;s brand-new V8, the first low-cost, eight-cylinder engine. This car was sold at an auction during the Amelia Island Concours d&#x27;Elegance in 2016.

After becoming the president of Ford, he advocated for the introduction of a more modern automobile to replace the Model T, but was repeatedly overruled by his father. Dwindling market share finally made the introduction of a new model inevitable: the Model A.

During the design of the Model A in 1927, Henry Ford assured mechanical quality and reliability, allowing his son to develop the body, with the help of designer József Galamb. Edsel also prevailed upon his father to allow the inclusion of four-wheel mechanical brakes and a sliding-gear transmission on this model. The resulting Model A was a commercial success, selling over four million during four years of production.

As president, Edsel often disagreed with his father on major decisions and was occasionally humiliated in public by the older man. The relationship between the father and son was close, but fraught with unhealthy aspects. Edsel managed to introduce many lasting changes. He founded and named the Mercury division. He was responsible for the Lincoln-Zephyr and Continental. He significantly strengthened Ford Motors&#x27; overseas production, and modernized the company&#x27;s cars, such as by introducing hydraulic brakes.

==World War II==
As an early and enthusiastic advocate for aviation, Edsel insisted that the Ford company should develop airplanes, over the initial objections of his father, who could not envision commercial applications for planes. After having huge success as the US Post Office&#x27;s airmail carrier, Edsel&#x27;s foresight was rewarded. Because of his vision in this area, the company was able to respond to the critical need for airplanes during WW2.

=== Willow Run ===

The Ford Motor Company played a key role in the arming of the US &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot;. With Edsel leading the company, he set the goal of producing one bomber per hour at Ford&#x27;s expansive Willow Run manufacturing complex, where the B-24 was produced. It was said that the stress of this job caused Edsel to become mortally ill.

=== Nazi collaboration ===

According to Max Wallace in &quot;The American Axis: Ford, Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich&quot;, letters between Edsel and Maurice Dollfus, the head of Ford SAF, sent in 1942 indicate that Ford knew and approved of their French subsidiary&#x27;s manufacturing efforts on behalf of the German military. Edsel was also present at a celebratory dinner at the Manhattan Waldorf Astoria organized by Gerhard Alois Westrick after the Fall of France. Other attendees included Sosthenes Behn of ITT, Torkild Rieber of Texaco, James D. Mooney of General Motors, and Philip Dakin Wagoner of the Underwood Typewriter Company.

==Death and legacy==
Ford developed metastatic stomach cancer and undulant fever. Surgery for the cancer was unsuccessful due to the metastasis, and he died in 1943 at Gaukler Point, in his lakeside home in Grosse Pointe Shores, at the age of 49 from stomach cancer. All of his nonvoting stock was donated through a codicil in his will to the Ford Foundation, which he had founded with his father seven years earlier. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit.

Each of Ford&#x27;s children inherited sizable shares in the Ford Motor Company, and the three sons all worked in the family business. On Edsel&#x27;s death, his father briefly reassumed the presidency of Ford, then Edsel&#x27;s son, Henry Ford II, became president of the company on September 21, 1945.

Ford was one of the most significant art benefactors in Detroit history. As president of the Detroit Arts Commission, he commissioned the famous Diego Rivera &quot;Detroit Industry Murals&quot; in the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA). He was an early collector of African art and his contributions became part of the core of the original DIA African art collection. After his death, his family continued to make significant contributions.

He helped finance exploratory expeditions, including the historic flight of Admiral Richard Byrd over the North Pole in 1926. Byrd, in his Antarctic expeditions, also financed by Edsel, named the Edsel Ford Range of mountains after him. Other Antarctic homages include Ford Massif, Ford Nunataks, and Ford Peak.

Interstate 94 in the Detroit Metropolitan Area is named the Edsel Ford Freeway.

In September 1957, Ford Motor Company unveiled a new division of cars called Edsel. The Edsel division included the Citation, Corsair, Pacer, Ranger, Bermuda, Villager, and Roundup models. The Edsel division is remembered as a significant commercial failure. The cars sold moderately well in their first year, but the Edsel division was discontinued soon after the 1960 models were introduced.

==Edsel and Eleanor Ford House==
In September of 1928 the Ford family moved into Gaukler Point, their new home designed by Albert Kahn, on the shores of Lake St. Clair in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan. The estate&#x27;s landscape and gardens were designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen with his traditional long view, giving visitors a glimpse of the residence down the long meadow before revealing the entire house at drive&#x27;s end.

He also designed the gardens for Edsel and Eleanor&#x27;s summer estate Skylands in Seal Harbor on Mount Desert Island in Maine. Jensen designed work for their other Michigan residence, Haven Hill, between 1922 and 1935. Haven Hill, now within the Highland Recreation Area near White Lake Township in southeastern Michigan, is designated as both a Michigan State Historical Landmark and State Natural Preserve. Jensen&#x27;s landscape elements, with the diversity of tree, plant, and animal life, combine aesthetics, history, and nature.

Ford died at Gaukler Point in 1943. His wife Eleanor continued living there until her death in 1976. It was her wish that the property be used for &quot;the benefit of the public.&quot; The Edsel and Eleanor Ford House is now open to the public. Located on , the house has an excellent collection of the Fords&#x27; original antiques and art, and the historical landscape grounds on the lakefront. The museum currently hosts tours, classes, lectures, and special events. The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Capital City is a television series which focused on the professional and personal lives of a group of investment bankers working in the dealing room at Shane Longman, a fictional international bank based in the City of London. The 23-episode series was produced by Euston Films, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thames Television, for the ITV network.

Thames Television spent an estimated £500,000 to run newspaper and billboard advertisements to promote the series&#x27; launch which at the time was believed to be the largest advertising spend for a programme in the history of ITV. Full-page advertisements were taken in six national newspapers including &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. The ads promoted the Shane Longman &quot;brand&quot;, rather than &quot;Capital City&quot;, and featured images of cast members in character.

Thames Television stated that the press and poster ads were considered necessary to raise the profile of the series amongst members of the public who had a specialised or more professional interest, however a number of City bankers described the series as &quot;fairly inaccurate&quot;, &quot;confusing for the ordinary viewer&quot;, and lacking solid research. One television critic stated: &quot;All of this would have been quite novel and exciting three years ago, but the world has turned, the market has crashed and we have all seen enough of other people&#x27;s Porsches to last a lifetime... City hustlers do not look very heroic any more, just extravagantly paid.&quot;

Still, it could be argued that most of the characters in &quot;Capital City&quot; – perhaps with the exception of the reckless and predatory Jimmy Destry, power-hungry Lee Wolf and the duplicitous Sylvia Roux Teng – portray City bankers in a generally positive manner. The primary characters come across as likeable and – in contrast to the Gordon Gekko &quot;greed is good&quot; stereotype often associated with their industry – as possessing a moral and/or social conscience; in one episode, the entire dealing room threatens to go on strike in protest against handling a bond issue on behalf of a company which dumps toxic waste in poor African countries and demand that Shane Longman introduce policies which enable them to avoid dealing with clients whom they regard as unethical.

&quot;Capital City&quot; is very much a product of the late 1980s, on the cusp of the digital revolution. The dealing room computers used what appeared to be a DOS operating system; mobile phones were the size of bricks; the primary methods of long-distance &quot;instant&quot; communication were still the land line telephone, fax and telex; and smoking – banned in England, within most public buildings, in 2007 – was still allowed in the workplace as well as inside restaurants, bars and other public places. At the same time, the series dealt with several mature storylines including alcoholism, depression, mental illness, sexual assault, drug use, homosexuality, physical assault, gambling addiction, prostitution, promiscuity, shoplifting, fraud, bribery, corruption and abortion.

==Series trivia==
*The series was created by Andrew Maclear, who also wrote the 1989 movie Dealers; the film&#x27;s dealing room set, which reportedly cost £1,000,000 to construct, was retained for use in &quot;Capital City&quot;. The dealing room equipment was provided by Reuters Limited.
*Exterior scenes were shot throughout London and landmarks such as Big Ben, the Palace of Westminster, Tower Bridge, River Thames and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral appeared as backdrops. Coincidentally, stylised forms of these icons were also featured in the on-air idents for Euston Films&#x27; parent company, Thames Television, that were shown at the end of each episode.
*It is estimated that Euston Films spent more than US$10 million to produce the first 13 episodes (series one)
*The music for the series was composed by Colin Towns and enjoyed some success in its own right.
*The bank&#x27;s address is shown in an Attachment of Earnings Order (Judgment Debt) served on Lee Wolf as 8 Gracewell Street, London EC2; Wolf&#x27;s address is shown in the same document as 56 Chalfont Court, 238 Baker Street, London NW1. Neither address actually exists.
*Shane Longman&#x27;s headquarters are located near the Bank of England; in one episode Michelle Hauptmann loses her driver&#x27;s licence for one year after being caught speeding in her Porsche and is shown exiting the London Underground at Bank station after catching the Tube to work.
*In the final episode, Michelle and Declan are married and, in the closing scenes, are shown travelling by water taxi to the airport en route to their honeymoon in Venice; their marriage is taken to have occurred 1 September 1990 as this is the date shown on their travel documents.

==Series quotes==

*James Farrell to (the newly married) Declan and Michelle McConnochie: &quot;In 30 years of banking, this is the happiest merger I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, to which Declan replies: &quot;James, this isn&#x27;t a merger. This is a takeover.&quot;

<doc id="214888" wikidata="Q513777" url="?curid=214888" title="Jeanne Mance">
<text>Jeanne Mance (; November 12, 1606 – June 18, 1673) was a French nurse and settler of New France. She arrived in New France two years after the Ursuline nuns came to Quebec. Among the founders of Montreal in 1642, she established its first hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, in 1645. She returned twice to France to seek financial support for the hospital. After providing most of the care directly for years, in 1657 she recruited three sisters of the Religieuses hospitalières de Saint-Joseph, and continued to direct operations of the hospital. During her era, she was also known as Jehanne Mance contemporarily by the French, and as Joan Mance by the English contemporarily.

==Early years==
Jeanne Mance was born (as Jehanne Mance) into a bourgeois family in Langres, in Haute-Marne, France. She was the daughter of Catherine Émonnot and Charles Mance, a prosecutor for the king in Langres, an important diocese in the northern Burgundy. After her mother died, Jeanne cared for eleven brothers and sisters. She went on to care for victims of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the plague.

==Vocation==
At age 34, while on a pilgrimage to Troyes in Champagne, Mance discovered her missionary calling. She decided to go to New France in North America, then in the first stages of colonization by the French. She was supported by Anne of Austria, the wife of King Louis XIII, and by the Jesuits. She was not interested in marriage in Nouvelle-France.

Mance was a member of the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal; its goal was to convert the natives and found a hospital in Montreal similar to the one in Quebec.

==Founding of Montreal and Hôtel-Dieu Hospital==
Charles Lallemant recruited Jeanne Mance for the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal. Mance embarked from La Rochelle on May 9, 1641, on a crossing of the Atlantic that took three months. After wintering in Quebec, she and Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve arrived at the Island of Montreal in the spring of 1642. They founded the new city on May 17, 1642, on land granted by the Governor. That same year Mance began operating a hospital in her home.

Three years later (1645), with a donation of 6000 francs by Angélique Bullion, she opened a hospital on Rue Saint-Paul. She directed its operations for 17 years. A new stone structure was built in 1688, and others have been built since then.

==Later years==
In 1650, Mance visited France, returning with 22,000 French &quot;livres&quot; from &quot;Duchesse d’Aiguillon&quot; to fund the hospital (which later, was increased to 40,500 &quot;livres&quot;). On her return to Montreal, she found that the attacks of the Iroquois threatened the colony and loaned the hospital money to M. de Maisonneuve, who returned to France to organize a force of one hundred men for the colony&#x27;s defense.

Mance made a second trip to France in 1657 to seek financial assistance for the hospital. At the same time, she secured three Hospital Sisters of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph from the convent of La Fleche in Anjou: Judith Moreau de Bresoles, Catherine Mace, and Marie Maillet. They had a difficult passage on the return, made worse by an outbreak of the plague on board, but all four women survived. While Mgr. de Laval tried to retain the sisters at Quebec for that hospital, they eventually reached Montreal in October 1659.

With the help of the new sisters, Mance was able to ensure the continued operations of the hospital. For the rest of her years, she lived more quietly.

She died in 1673 and was buried in the church of the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, her hospital. While the church and her house were demolished in 1696 for redevelopment, her work was carried on by the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph. The three nuns whom she had recruited in 1659 served as hospital administrators. Two centuries later, in 1861, the hospital was moved to the foot of Mount Royal.

<text>USS &quot;Essex&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-9) was an aircraft carrier and the lead ship of the 24-ship built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in December 1942, &quot;Essex&quot; participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning the Presidential Unit Citation and 13 battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), eventually becoming an antisubmarine aircraft carrier (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, playing a role in the Cuban Missile Crisis. She also participated in the Korean War, earning four battle stars and the Navy Unit Commendation. She was the primary recovery carrier for the Apollo 7 space mission.

She was decommissioned for the last time in 1969 and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service for scrap on 1June 1973.

== Construction and commissioning ==
&quot;Essex&quot; was laid down on 28April 1941 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. After the Pearl Harbor attack, her building contract (along with the same for and ) was reworked. After an accelerated construction, she was launched on 31 July 1942, sponsored by Alice Trubee Davison, the wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. She was commissioned on 31December 1942, with Captain Donald B. Duncan commanding.

== Service history ==

=== World War II ===
Following her accelerated builder&#x27;s trials and shakedown cruise, &quot;Essex&quot; moved to the Pacific in May 1943. Departing from Pearl Harbor, she participated with Task Force 16 (TF 16) in carrier operations against Marcus Island. On 31August 1943, she was designated the flagship of TF14 and struck Wake Island on 5and6 October. On 11November, she took part in carrier operations during the Rabaul strike, alongside and . She then launched an attack with Task Group 50.3 (TG50.3) against the Gilbert Islands where she took part in her first amphibious assault during the Battle of Tarawa. After refueling at sea, she cruised as the flagship of TG50.3 to attack Kwajalein on 4 December. Her second amphibious assault delivered in company with TG50.3 was against the Marshall Islands on 29January to 2February 1944.

&quot;Essex,&quot; in TG50.3, now joined with TG58.1 and TG58.2 to constitute Task Force 58, the &quot;Fast Carrier Task Force&quot;, launched an attack against Truk between 17and 18February 1944 during which eight Japanese ships were sunk. While en route to the Mariana Islands to sever Japanese supply lines, the carrier force was detected and subjected to a prolonged aerial attack which it repelled successfully. It then continued with the scheduled attack upon Saipan, Tinian, and Guam on 23February 1944.

After this operation, &quot;Essex&quot; proceeded to San Francisco for her single wartime overhaul, after which, &quot;Essex&quot; became the carrier for Air Group 15, the &quot;Fabled Fifteen&quot; commanded by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s top ace of the war, David McCampbell. She then joined carriers and in TG12.1 to strike Marcus Island on 19to 20May 1944, and Wake, on 23May 1944. She deployed with TF58 to support the occupation of the Marianas on 12June to10 August; sortied with TG38.3 to lead an attack against the Palau Islands on 6to 8September, and Mindanao on 9to 10September with enemy shipping as the main target, and remained in the area to support landings on Peleliu. On 2October, she weathered a typhoon and four days later departed with Task Force 38(TF 38) for the Ryukyus.

For the remainder of 1944, she continued her frontline action, participating in strikes against Okinawa on 1October, and Formosa from 1to 14October, covering the Leyte landings, taking part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf 24to 25October, and continuing the search for enemy fleet units until 30October, when she returned to Ulithi, Caroline Islands, for replenishment. She resumed the offensive and delivered attacks on Manila and the northern Philippine Islands during November. On 25November, for the first time, &quot;Essex&quot; received damage. A &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit the port edge of her flight deck, landing among planes fueled for takeoff, and causing extensive damage, killing 15, and wounding 44.

Following quick repairs, she operated with the task force off Leyte supporting the occupation of Mindoro 14to 16December 1944. She rode out Typhoon Cobra and made a special search for survivors afterward. With TG38.3, she participated in the Lingayen Gulf operations, launched strikes against Formosa, Sakishima, Okinawa, and Luzon. Entering the South China Sea in search of enemy surface forces, the task force pounded shipping and conducted strikes on Formosa, the China coast, Hainan, and Hong Kong. &quot;Essex&quot; withstood the onslaught of the third typhoon in four months on 20and 21January 1945 before striking again at Formosa, Miyako-jima, and Okinawa on 26and 27January.

For the remainder of the war, she operated with TF58, conducting attacks against the Tokyo area on 16and 17February. On 25February 1945, she was deployed to neutralize the enemy&#x27;s air power before the landings on Iwo Jima and to cripple the aircraft-manufacturing industry. She sent support missions against Iwo Jima and neighboring islands, but from 23March to 28May, was employed primarily to support the conquest of Okinawa. In the closing days of the war, &quot;Essex&quot; took part in the final telling raids against the Japanese home islands on 10July to 15August 1945. Following the surrender of Japan, she continued defensive combat air patrols until 3 September, when she was ordered to Bremerton, Washington, for inactivation. She arrived at Puget Sound on 15 September.

===1950s===
On 9January 1947, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. Modernization endowed &quot;Essex&quot; with a new flight deck, and a streamlined island superstructure on 16 January 1951, when she was recommissioned, with Captain A. W. Wheelock commanding. After a brief cruise in Hawaiian waters, she began the first of three tours in Far Eastern waters during the Korean War. She served as flagship for Carrier Division 1 and Task Force 77. She was the first carrier to launch F2H Banshees on combat missions; on 16September 1951, one of these planes, damaged in combat, crashed into aircraft parked on the forward flight deck, causing an explosion and fire, which killed seven. After repairs at Yokosuka, she returned to frontline action on 3October to launch strikes up to the Yalu River and provide close air support for U.N. troops. Her two deployments in the Korean War were from August 1951March 1952 and July 1952January 1953. On 1December 1953, she started her final tour of the war, sailing in the East China Sea with what official U.S. Navy records describe as the &quot;Peace Patrol&quot;.
In the spring of 1954, she was dispatched along with the to the South China Sea, between Indochina and the Philippines, while the United States considered whether to use carrier aircraft to support French troops during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, a key battle in the First Indochina War. The United States eventually decided to not join the fighting. From November 1954 – June 1955, she engaged in training exercises, operated for three months with the United States Seventh Fleet, assisted in the Tachen Islands evacuation, and engaged in air operations and fleet maneuvers off Okinawa.

In July 1955, &quot;Essex&quot; entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for repairs and extensive alterations. The SCB-125 modernization program included installation of an angled flight deck and an enclosed hurricane bow, as well as relocation of the aft elevator to the starboard deck edge. Modernization completed, she rejoined the Pacific Fleet in March 1956. For the next 14 months, the carrier operated off the West Coast, except for a six-month cruise with the 7th Fleet in the Far East. Ordered to join the Atlantic Fleet for the first time in her long career, she sailed from San Diego on 21June 1957, rounded Cape Horn, and arrived at Naval Station Mayport on 1 August.

In the fall of 1957, &quot;Essex&quot; participated as an antisubmarine carrier in the NATO Exercise Strikeback and in February 1958, deployed with the 6th Fleet until May, when she shifted to the eastern Mediterranean. Alerted to the Middle East crisis on 14July 1958, she sped to support the US landings in Beirut, Lebanon, launching reconnaissance and patrol missions until 20August. Once again, she was ordered to proceed to Asian waters and transited the Suez Canal to arrive in the Taiwan operational area, where she joined TF77 in conducting flight operations before rounding the Horn and proceeding back to Mayport. &quot;Essex&quot; joined with the 2nd Fleet and British ships in Atlantic exercises and with NATO forces in the eastern Mediterranean during the fall of 1959. In December she aided victims of a disastrous flood at Fréjus, France.

In the spring of 1960, she was converted into an ASW Support Carrier and was thereafter homeported at Quonset Point, Rhode Island. Since that time, she operated as the flagship of Carrier Division 18 and Antisubmarine Carrier Group Three. She conducted rescue and salvage operations off the New Jersey coast for a downed blimp, cruised with midshipmen, and was deployed on NATO and CENTO exercises that took her through the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean. Her ports of call included Karachi and the British Crown Colony of Aden. In November, she joined the French navy in Operation Jet Stream. On 7November 1960, the Soviet research vessel was reported by TASS to have been buzzed in the Arabian Sea by a Grumman S-2F Tracker from &quot;Essex&quot;. The United States Navy denied that the aircraft was buzzing the ship, claiming it was merely establishing her identity.

=== Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis ===
In April 1961, &quot;Essex&quot; steamed out of Quonset Point on a two-week &quot;routine training&quot; cruise, purportedly to support the carrier qualification of a squadron of Navy pilots. Twelve A4D Skyhawks from VA-34 stationed at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, flew aboard. VS-34 aircraft had been removed to make room for VA-34&#x27;s aircraft. VA-34&#x27;s support enlisted crew flew aboard in C1A COD aircraft. The A4D-2 were armed with two 20 mm Mk-12 cannons loaded with &quot;service&quot; ammo and one LAU-3a 19 shot 2.75 FFAR pod with &quot;antitank&quot; warheads mounted on the centerline ejector rack, Station 3. After several days at sea, all their identifying markings were crudely obscured with flat gray paint. They began flying two aircraft missions by day only. Not generally known to the &quot;Essex&quot; crew, they had been tasked to provide air support to CIA-sponsored bombers during the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion. Cuba&#x27;s leader Castro knew the &quot;Essex&quot; was off the Cuban coast, but the US Navy denied that claim. The naval aviation part of the mission was aborted by President John F. Kennedy at the last moment and the &quot;Essex&quot; crew was sworn to secrecy. Returning home and while at sea, VA-34&#x27;s aircraft were hastily repainted &quot;national stars and bars&quot; by all available enlisted personnel, then flew off and landed at NAS Jacksonville, and underwent professional repainting at the NARF Naval Aviation Rework facility. The planes then flew a few miles over to her home base at NAS Cecil Field. The entire VA-34 crew was sworn to secrecy. In 1967–68, VA-34&#x27;s crew was awarded the Navy and Marine Expeditionary medals.

Later in 1961, &quot;Essex&quot; completed a &quot;People to People&quot; cruise to Northern Europe with ports of call in Rotterdam, Hamburg, and Greenock. During the Hamburg visit, over one million visitors toured &quot;Essex&quot;. During her departure, &quot;Essex&quot; almost ran aground in the shallow Elbe River. On her return voyage to the United States, she ran into a severe North Atlantic storm (January 1962) and suffered major structural damage. In early 1962, she went into dry dock in the Brooklyn Navy Yard for a major overhaul.

&quot;Essex&quot; had just finished her six-month-long overhaul and was at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base for sea trials when President Kennedy placed a naval &quot;quarantine&quot; on Cuba in October 1962, in response to the discovered presence of Soviet missiles in that country. The word &quot;quarantine&quot; was used rather than &quot;blockade&quot; for reasons of international law, Kennedy reasoned that a blockade would be an act of war, and war had not been declared between the U.S. and Cuba. &quot;Essex&quot; spent over a month in the Caribbean as one of the US Navy ships enforcing this &quot;quarantine&quot;, returning home just before Thanksgiving.

=== Later career ===

While conducting replenishment exercises with NATO forces on 10 November 1966, &quot;Essex&quot; collided with the submerged submarine . The submarine sustained extensive sail damage, returning to port unassisted. Aboard &quot;Essex&quot;, the hull was opened, and the ship&#x27;s speed indicator equipment was destroyed, but the carrier was still able to make port unassisted. &quot;Essex&quot; subsequently reported to the Boston Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul and hull repairs.

On 25 May 1968, &quot;Essex&quot; was underway in the Norwegian Sea when she was buzzed four times by a Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 heavy bomber. On the fourth pass, the plane&#x27;s wing clipped the surface of the sea, and the aircraft disintegrated. The &quot;Essex&quot; launched rescue helicopters, but none of the crew on board survived. Three bodies and wreckage were recovered and transferred to a Russian destroyer via life boat.

&quot;Essex&quot; was scheduled to be the prime recovery carrier for the ill-fated Apollo 1 space mission. She was to pick up Apollo1 astronauts north of Puerto Rico on 7March 1967 after a 14-day spaceflight. However, the mission did not take place because on 27January 1967, the Apollo1″s crew was killed by a flash fire in their spacecraft on LC-34 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. &quot;Essex&quot; was the prime recovery carrier for the Apollo 7 mission. She recovered the Apollo 7 crew on 22October 1968 after a splashdown north of Puerto Rico. &quot;Essex&quot; was the main vessel on which future Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong served during the Korean War.

&quot;Essex&quot; was decommissioned on 30June 1969 at Boston Navy Yard. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1June 1973 and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 1June 1975. &quot;Essex&quot; was scrapped at Kearny, New Jersey.

<doc id="214895" wikidata="Q57594" url="?curid=214895" title="Wilhelm, Prince of Albania">
<text>Wilhelm, Prince of Albania (Wilhelm Friedrich Heinrich; , 26 March 1876 – 18 April 1945) was sovereign of the Principality of Albania from 7 March to 3 September 1914. His reign officially came to an end on 31 January 1925, when the country was declared an Albanian Republic.

Outside the country and in diplomatic correspondence, he was styled &quot;sovereign prince&quot;, but in Albania, he was referred to as &quot;mbret&quot;, or king.

==Family and early life==

William was born on 26 March 1876 in Neuwied Castle, near Koblenz, in the Prussian Rhineland, as Prince William of Wied (). Born into the mediatised house of Wied-Neuwied, he was the third son of William, 5th Prince of Wied (brother of Queen Elisabeth of Romania), and his wife Princess Marie of the Netherlands (sister of Queen Louise of Sweden). He was second cousin of Wilhelm II, German Emperor.

Prince William served as a Prussian cavalry officer before becoming a captain in the German General Staff in 1911.

==Candidate for the Albanian throne==
Prince William&#x27;s aunt, Queen Elisabeth of Romania, on learning that the Great Powers were looking for an aristocrat to rule over Albania, asked Take Ionescu to attempt to persuade them to appoint her nephew to the post.
Eventually the European Great Powers – Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the French Third Republic, the German Empire, the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy – selected William, a member of the German princely house of Wied, and related to the Queen of the Netherlands to rule over the newly independent Albania. The announcement was made in November 1913 and the decision was accepted by Ismail Kemal, the head of the provisional government. The offer of the Albanian throne was first made to him in the spring of 1913 but he turned it down. Despite rejecting the offer, the Austrians put pressure on Prince William in an attempt to change his mind. Kaiser Wilhelm was not pleased with the selection of the prince as the king of Albania; considering the choice to be unwise. The Kaiser claimed that he tried to have &quot;a Mohammedan Prince chosen, if possible&quot;.

Europeans consider Albania to be a poor, lawless and backward country, and some foreign opinion was scathing. The French press referred to Wilhelm as &quot;le Prince de Vide&quot;, meaning &quot;the prince of emptiness&quot;; vide being a pun on his homeland of Wied.

==Prince of Albania==

On 7 February 1914, William let the Great Powers know that he would accept the throne. On 21 February 1914 a delegation of Albanian notables led by Essad Pasha Toptani and Arbëreshë ones (headed by Luigi Baffa and Vincenzo Baffa Trasci), made a formal request, which he accepted thereby becoming &quot;By the grace of the powers and the will of the people the Prince (Mbret) of Albania&quot;. One month after accepting the throne on 7 March, he arrived in his provisional capital of Durrës and started to organise his government, appointing Turhan Pasha Përmeti to form the first Albanian cabinet. This first cabinet was dominated by aristocrats (prince Essad Pasha Toptani defence and foreign affairs, prince Gjergj Adhamidhi bej Frashëri finances, prince Aziz Pasha Vrioni agriculture).

His brief reign proved a turbulent one. Immediately following his arrival, revolts of Muslims broke out in central Albania against his Chief Minister, Essad Pasha, and against foreign domination that was not Turkish. Greece encouraged the formation of a separatist provisional government in North Epirus. William&#x27;s position was also undermined by his own officials, notably Essad Pasha himself, who actually accepted money from Italy to finance a revolt and to stage a coup against William. The plot was exposed, Pasha was arrested on 19 May 1914, tried for treason and sentenced to death. Only the intervention of the Italian government saved his life and he escaped to exile in Italy.

The outbreak of World War I presented more problems for Prince William as Austria-Hungary demanded that he send Albanian soldiers to fight alongside them. When he refused, citing the neutrality of Albania in the Treaty of London, the remuneration that he had been receiving was cut off.

==Reign in exile, overthrow, and death==

Prince William left the country on 3 September 1914 originally heading to Venice. Despite leaving Albania he did so insisting that he remained head of state. In his proclamation he informed the people that &quot;he deemed it necessary to absent himself temporarily.&quot; He was also styled Skanderbeg II, in homage to Skanderbeg, the national hero.

He returned to Germany and rejoined the Imperial German Army under the pseudonym &quot;Count of Kruja&quot; (). The name derived from the city of Krujë in Albania. When the Austro-Hungarians forced the Serbian and Montenegrin armies out of Northern Albania in the early months of 1916, William&#x27;s hopes of being restored were raised although ultimately they came to nothing. After the war, he still harboured ambitions that he might be restored, but the participants at the Paris Peace Conference were unlikely to restore the throne to someone who had just fought against them.

Although several of the factions competing for power in post-war Albania billed themselves as regencies for William, once central authority was definitively restored in 1924, the country was declared a republic on 31 January 1925, officially ending his reign.

With the monarchy in Albania set to be restored with President Ahmet Zogu becoming king, Prince William reaffirmed his claim to the throne announcing he still claimed the throne for himself and his heirs.

Prince William died in Predeal, near Sinaia, in Romania, leaving his son, Hereditary Prince Carol Victor, as heir to his Albanian claims. He was buried at the in Bucharest.

==Marriage and children==
On 30 November 1906 at Waldenburg, Saxony, Prince William married Princess Sophie of Schönburg-Waldenburg (1885–1936), member of the House of Schönburg, daughter of Hereditary Prince Otto Karl Viktor I von Schönburg-Waldenburg (1856-1888) and his wife, Princess Lucie zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1859-1903). She had remotely distant Albanian roots, through Orthodox Ghica family. They had two children:
*Princess Marie Eleonore (1909–1956) ⚭ Prince Alfred of Schönburg-Waldenburg (1905–1941), son of Prince Heinrich of Schönburg-Waldenburg and Princess Olga of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg ⚭ Ion Octavian Bunea (1899–1977)
*Hereditary Prince Carol Victor (1913–1973) ⚭ Eileen de Coppet (1922–1985)

Prince Wilhelm is portrayed in the 2008 Albanian film &quot;Time of the Comet (based on Ismail Kadare&#x27;s novel &quot;The dark year&quot; (Viti i mbrapshtë)&quot;, which takes place during his reign. He is played by the German actor Thomas Heinze.

<text>The La Fayette Escadrille () was the name of the French Air Force unit escadrille N 124 during the First World War (1914–1918). This escadrille of the &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot; was composed largely of American volunteer pilots flying fighters. It was named in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, French hero of the American Revolutionary War. In September 1917, the escadrille was transferred to the United States Army under the designation 103rd Aero Squadron. In 1921, the French Air Force recreated a N124 unit who claimed lineage from the war-time La Fayette escadrille and is now part of the escadron 2/4 La Fayette.

==History==


Dr. Edmund L. Gros, a founder of the American Hospital of Paris and organizer of the American Ambulance Field Service, and Norman Prince, a Harvard-educated lawyer and an American expatriate already flying for France, led the attempts to persuade the French government of the value of a volunteer American air unit fighting for France. The aim was to have their efforts recognized by the American public and thus, it was hoped, the resulting publicity would rouse interest in abandoning neutrality and joining the fight. Authorized by the French Air Department on March 21, 1916, the &quot;Escadrille de Chasse Nieuport 124&quot; (Escadrille Américaine) was deployed on April 20 in Luxeuil-les-Bains, France, near Switzerland&#x27;s border. Despite the unit&#x27;s weak notorious status in the United States, the Escadrille proved useful for the French and Americans, taking into consideration that before the First World War, aircraft were not considered combat units. Initially, there were seven Americans pilots: Victor E. Chapman, Elliott C. Cowdin, Bert Hall, James Rogers McConnell, Norman Prince, Kiffin Rockwell, and William Thaw II. The full roster included 38 pilots.

The unit&#x27;s aircraft, mechanics, and uniforms were French, as was the commander, Captain Georges Thénault. Five French pilots were also on the roster, serving at various times in command positions. Raoul Lufbery, a French-born American citizen, became the squadron&#x27;s first, and ultimately their highest scoring flying ace, with 16 confirmed victories.

Two unofficial members of the Escadrille Américaine, lion cubs named Whiskey and Soda, provided countless moments of relief from battle stress to fliers.

A German objection filed with the U.S. government, over the actions of a supposed neutral nation, led to the name change to La Fayette Escadrille in December 1916, as the original name implied that the U.S. was allied to France rather than neutral.

The Escadrille was disbanded on 18 February 1918. The American personnel transferred to the United States Army Air Service as the 103d Aero Squadron, while the French formed the Escadrille SPA.124 &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;. A total of 224 Americans served in the unit. Of those, 51 died in combat, while another 11 died of other causes. Fifteen became prisoners of war. Eleven pilots became aces.

Not all American pilots were in the Lafayette Escadrille; over 200 fought for France as part of the La Fayette Flying Corps. On 3 April 1918, eleven American pilots from the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force were assigned to Escadrille N.471, an air defense squadron stationed near Paris. American flyers served with this French unit until 18 July 1918, and it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Second Escadrille Américaine.&quot;

Later, the Escadron de Chasse 2/4 La Fayette retook the unit designation of &quot;La Fayette&quot;, this time however in the French Air Force.

==Combat==
The first major action seen by the squadron was 13 May 1916 at the Battle of Verdun and five days later, Kiffin Rockwell recorded the unit&#x27;s first aerial victory. On 23 June, the Escadrille suffered its first fatality when Victor Chapman was shot down over Douaumont. The unit was posted to the front until September 1916, when the unit was moved back to Luxeuil-les-Bains in 7 Army area. On 23 September, Rockwell was killed when his Nieuport was downed by the gunner in a German Albatros observation plane and in October, Norman Prince was fatally injured after crashing on final approach to his airfield. The squadron, flying Nieuport, later Spad, scouts, suffered heavy losses, but it received replacements until a total of 38 American pilots eventually served with the squadron. So many Americans volunteered to fly for France that they were eventually farmed out to other French squadrons. As a group, the Americans who flew in the war for France&#x27;s air service, the &quot;Aéronautique militaire&quot;, are collectively known as the La Fayette Flying Corps. Altogether, 265 American volunteers served in the corps.

On 8 February 1918, the squadron was disbanded, and 12 of its American members inducted into the U.S. Air Service as members of the 103rd Aero Squadron. For a brief period, it retained its French aircraft and mechanics. Most of its veteran members were set to work training newly arrived American pilots. The 103rd was credited with a further 45 kills before the Armistice went into effect on 11 November. The French Escadrille SPA.124, also known as the Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Escadrille, continued Lafayette Escadrille&#x27;s traditions in the Service Aéronautique.


== Casualties ==
Nine pilots died in the Lafayette Escadrille while others perished after leaving the unit. More sustained non-fatal injuries. The planes flown were flimsy, and not as safe as those of later years. Engines and other parts failed, and machine-guns often jammed when they were needed. One man asked to be moved back to his infantry unit, where &quot;he could be safe.&quot; The first pilot to be killed in action was Victor Chapman. Edmond Genet became the first American casualty of World War I following the U.S. entry into the war. Other Americans had died previous to the U.S. declaration of war, but since Genet had been active in the Escadrille since before the U.S. entry into the war, his death only a few days after the U.S. declaration of war made him the first official U.S. casualty.

==Members==


After the Great War, membership in the Escadrille Lafayette was claimed by over 4,000 people, &quot;including a dozen well-known Hollywood personalities and several high government officials.&quot;

Also, from the beginning there was a great deal of confusion between American pilots who were members of the Lafayette Escadrille, a designated all-American aviation squadron of the French Service Aeronautique; and the Lafayette Flying Corps, an unofficial &quot;paper&quot; organization highlighting in its roster published during the war the names of approximately 231 American volunteer aviators who flew with more than 90 French operational escadrilles. Already existing confusion was exacerbated after a screening of the film &quot;Flyboys&quot; in 2006.

Five French officers and 38 American pilots, also known as &quot;The Valiant 38&quot;, were members of the Lafayette Escadrille.

==Tributes==
* La Fayette Escadrille Memorial Cemetery, Villeneuve-l&#x27;Étang Imperial Estate, in Marnes-la-Coquette, Hauts-de-Seine, outside of Paris, the final work of French architect Alexandre Marcel, 1928. The memorial commemorates the birthplace of American combat aviation, and serves as a symbol of the Franco-American comradeship during World War I. This site honors the American volunteer pilots who flew with French squadrons during the Great War, and is the final resting place for some of America&#x27;s first combat aviators and their French officers. Dedicated in 1928, the memorial cemetery consists of an ornate central arch, half the size of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, with a French inscription on the facade, and an English translation on the rear. The central arch is flanked by wings on either side that include open hallways terminating in end pavilions. A reflecting pool runs the length of the structure. Behind the memorial is a semi-circular terrace that forms the roof of the crypt below. Stained-glass windows in the crypt depict the major battles of the Western Front. In the memorial crypt are 68 sarcophagi, one for each of the aviators of the Lafayette Flying Corps who lost their lives during World War I. Forty-nine of these aviators are entombed in the crypt along with two of their French commanding officers. The remainder rest in other locations, or their remains were never recovered. By the early 21st century, decades of delayed maintenance to the memorial had led to structural damage, water intrusion and corrosion that required large-scale repair. Understanding its significance in the history of American military aviation, the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), through an agreement with the Lafayette Escadrille Memorial Foundation and the French government that included financial support, led restoration efforts in 2015 and 2016, in time for the 100th anniversary of the formation of the squadron. In January 2017, ABMC officially assumed ownership and responsibility for the Lafayette Escadrille Memorial Cemetery, making it the 9th commemorative World War I cemetery administered by this federal agency.
* Memorial to the American Volunteers. On 4 July 1923, the President of the French Council of State, Raymond Poincaré, dedicated a monument in the Place des États-Unis, Paris, to the Americans who had volunteered to fight in World War I in the service of France.
* A statue by the sculptor Gutzon Borglum titled &quot;Aviator&quot; (1919) was erected on the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville in the memory of James R. McConnell, who was killed during the war.
* Two other memorials are dedicated to McConnell and located in Carthage, North Carolina. The first is a granite column flanked by two cannon, the other is a granite stone inscribed in French at the community house.

* Norman Prince tomb, Washington National Cathedral, Washington, D.C.
* There is a plaque in the memory of Kiffen Yates Rockwell in Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, the college Rockwell attended before the war.

The group was the subject of one of the &quot;We Were There&quot; historical books for young adults.

==Fictional accounts==
The story of the Lafayette Escadrille has been depicted in three feature films:
* &quot;The Legion of the Condemned&quot; (1928), a William A. Wellman film;
* &quot;Lafayette Escadrille&quot; (1958), a Wellman film starring Tab Hunter, and
* &quot;Flyboys&quot; (2006), directed by Tony Bill and starring James Franco.
The Lafayette Escadrille also appears in &quot;Attack of the Hawkmen&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; in which Indy is temporarily assigned to the group as an aerial reconnaissance photographer.

The exploits of the Lafayette Escadrille are also captured in several works of historical fiction including: &quot;Falcons of France&quot; by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall (1929) and &quot;To the Last Man&quot; by Jeffrey Shaara .

==Legacy==
The Lafayette Escadrille is part of the 2018 short documentary &quot;Raoul Lufbery: Fighter Ace&quot;. The film subject is fighter ace Raoul Lufbery, it was directed by Alexander Zane Irwin and produced by Daniel Bernardi with the collaboration of El Dorado Films and the Veteran Documentary Corps.

<text>The Eastern Catholic Churches or Oriental Catholic Churches, also called the Eastern-Rite Catholic Churches, Eastern Rite Catholicism, or simply the Eastern Churches, are 23 Eastern Christian autonomous (&quot;sui iuris&quot;) particular churches of the Catholic Church in full communion with the pope in Rome. Although they are distinct theologically, liturgically, and historically from the Latin Church, they are all in full communion with it and with each other. Eastern Catholics are a minority within the Catholic Church; of the 1.3 billion Catholics in communion with the pope, approximately 18 million are members of the eastern churches. The largest numbers of Eastern Catholics are found in Eastern Europe, Eastern Africa, the Middle East, and India. As of 2022, the Syro-Malabar Church is the largest Eastern Catholic Church, followed by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

With the exception of the Maronite Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches are groups that, at different points in the past, used to belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, or the Church of the East; these churches underwent various schisms through history. Eastern Catholic Churches that were formerly part of other communions have been points of controversy in ecumenical relations with the Eastern Orthodox and other non-Catholic churches. The five historic liturgical traditions of Eastern Christianity, namely the Alexandrian Rite, the Armenian Rite, the Byzantine Rite, the East Syriac Rite, and the West Syriac Rite, are all represented within Eastern Catholic liturgy. On occasion, this leads to a conflation of the liturgical word &quot;rite&quot; and the institutional word &quot;church&quot;. Some Eastern Catholic jurisdictions admit members of churches not in communion with Rome to the Eucharist and the other sacraments.

Full communion with the bishop of Rome constitutes mutual sacramental sharing between the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Latin Church and the recognition of papal supremacy. Provisions within the 1983 Latin canon law and the 1990 &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; govern the relationship between the Eastern and Latin Churches. Historically, pressure to conform to the norms of the Western Christianity practiced by the majority Latin Church led to a degree of encroachment (Latinization) on some of the Eastern Catholic traditions. The Second Vatican Council document, &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot;, built on previous reforms to reaffirm the right of Eastern Catholics to maintain their distinct practices.

The 1990 &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; was the first codified body of canon law governing the Eastern Catholic Churches collectively, although each church also has its own internal canons and laws on top of this. Members of Eastern Catholic churches are obliged to follow the norms of their particular church regarding celebration of church feasts, marriage, and other customs. Notable distinct norms include many Eastern Catholic Churches regularly allowing the ordination of married men to the priesthood (although not as bishops to the episcopacy), in contrast to the stricter clerical celibacy of Latin Church. Both Latin and Eastern Catholics may freely attend a Catholic liturgy celebrated in any rite.

==Terminology==

Although Eastern Catholics are in full communion with the pope and members of the worldwide Catholic Church, they are not members of the Latin Church, which uses the Latin liturgical rites, among which the Roman Rite is the most widespread. The Eastern Catholic churches are instead distinct particular churches &quot;sui iuris&quot;, although they maintain full and equal, mutual sacramental exchange with members of the Latin Church.

===&quot;Rite&quot; or &quot;church&quot;===
There are different meanings of the word &quot;rite&quot;. Apart from its reference to the liturgical patrimony of a particular church, the word has been and is still sometimes, even if rarely, officially used of the particular church itself. Thus the term &quot;Latin rite&quot; can refer either to the Latin Church or to one or more of the Latin liturgical rites, which include the Roman Rite, Ambrosian Rite, Mozarabic Rite, and others.

In the 1990 &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; (CCEO), the terms &quot;autonomous Church&quot; and &quot;rite&quot; are thus defined:

When speaking of Eastern Catholic Churches, the Latin Church&#x27;s 1983 Code of Canon Law (1983CIC) uses the terms &quot;ritual Church&quot; or &quot;ritual Church &quot;&quot;&quot; (canons 111 and 112), and also speaks of &quot;a subject of an Eastern rite&quot; (canon 1015 §2), &quot;Ordinaries of another rite&quot; (canon 450 §1), &quot;the faithful of a specific rite&quot; (canon 476), etc. The Second Vatican Council spoke of Eastern Catholic Churches as &quot;particular Churches or rites&quot;.

In 1999, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated: &quot;We have been accustomed to speaking of the Latin (Roman or Western) Rite or the Eastern Rites to designate these different Churches. However, the Church&#x27;s contemporary legislation as contained in the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; and the &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; makes it clear that we ought to speak, not of rites, but of Churches. Canon 112 of the Code of Canon Law uses the phrase &#x27;autonomous ritual Churches&#x27; to designate the various Churches.&quot; And a writer in a periodical of January 2006 declared: &quot;The Eastern Churches are still mistakenly called &#x27;Eastern-Rite&#x27; Churches, a reference to their various liturgical histories. They are most properly called Eastern Churches, or Eastern Catholic Churches.&quot; However, the term &quot;rite&quot; continues to be used. The forbids a Latin bishop to ordain, without permission of the Holy See, a subject of his who is &quot;of an Eastern rite&quot; (not &quot;who uses an Eastern rite&quot;, the faculty for which is sometimes granted to Latin clergy). 
===&quot;Uniate&quot;===

The term &quot;Uniat&quot; or &quot;Uniate&quot; has been applied to Eastern Catholic churches and individual members whose church hierarchies were previously part of Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox churches. The term is sometimes considered derogatory by such people, though it was used by some Latin and Eastern Catholics prior to the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965. Official Catholic documents no longer use the term due to its perceived negative overtones.

==History==

===Background===

Eastern Catholic Churches have their origins in the Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Eastern Europe and South India. However, since the 19th century, diaspora has spread to Western Europe, the Americas and Oceania in part because of persecution, where eparchies have been established to serve adherents alongside those of Latin Church dioceses. Latin Catholics in the Middle East, on the other hand, are traditionally cared for by the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem.

The communion between Christian churches has been broken over matters of faith, whereby each side accused the other of heresy or departure from the true faith (orthodoxy). Communion has been broken also because of disagreement about questions of authority or the legitimacy of the election of a particular bishop. In these latter cases, each side accused the other of schism, but not of heresy.

The following ecumenical councils are major breaches of communion:

==== Council of Ephesus (AD 431) ====
In 431, the churches that accepted the teaching of the Council of Ephesus (which condemned the views of Nestorius) were classified as heretics as those who rejected the council&#x27;s statements. The Church of the East, which was mainly under the Sassanid Empire, never accepted the council&#x27;s views. It later experienced a period of great expansion in Asia before collapsing after the Mongol invasion of the Middle East in the 14th century.

Monuments of their presence still exist in China. Now they are relatively few in number and have divided into three churches: the Chaldean Catholic Church—an Eastern Catholic church in full communion with Rome—and two Assyrian churches which are not in communion with either Rome or each other. The Chaldean Catholic Church is the largest of the three. The groups of Assyrians who did not reunify with Rome remained and are known as the Assyrian Church of the East, which experienced an internal schism in 1968 which led to the creation of the Ancient Church of the East.

The Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara churches are the two Eastern Catholic descendants of the Church of the East in the Indian subcontinent.

==== Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) ====
In 451, those who accepted the Council of Chalcedon similarly classified those who rejected it as Monophysite heretics. The Churches that refused to accept the Council considered instead that it was they who were orthodox; they rejected the description &quot;Monophysite&quot; (meaning &quot;only-nature&quot;) preferring instead &quot;Miaphysite&quot; (meaning &quot;one-nature&quot;). The difference in terms may appear subtle, but it is theologically very important. &quot;Monophysite&quot; implies a single divine nature alone with no real human nature—a heretical belief according to Chalcedonian Christianity—whereas &quot;Miaphysite&quot; can be understood to mean one nature as God, existing in the person of Jesus who is both human and divine—an idea more easily reconciled to Chalcedonian doctrine. They are often called, in English, Oriental Orthodox Churches, to distinguish them from the Eastern Orthodox Churches.

This distinction, by which the words &quot;oriental&quot; and &quot;eastern&quot; that in themselves have exactly the same meaning but are used as labels to describe two different realities, is impossible to translate in most other languages, and is not universally accepted even in English. These churches are also referred to as &quot;pre-Chalcedonian&quot; or now more rarely as &quot;non-Chalcedonian&quot; or &quot;anti-Chalcedonian&quot;. In languages other than English other means are used to distinguish the two families of Churches. Some reserve the term &quot;Orthodox&quot; for those that are here called &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot; Churches, but members of what is called &quot;Oriental Orthodox&quot; Churches consider this illicit.

==== East–West Schism (1054) ====
The East–West Schism came about in the context of cultural differences between the Greek-speaking East and Latin-speaking West, and of rivalry between the Churches in Rome—which claimed a primacy not merely of honour but also of authority—and in Constantinople, which claimed parity with Rome. The rivalry and lack of comprehension gave rise to controversies, some of which appear already in the acts of the Quinisext Council of 692. At the Council of Florence (1431–1445), these controversies about Western theological elaborations and usages were identified as, chiefly, the insertion of &quot;Filioque&quot; into the Nicene Creed, the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist, purgatory, and the authority of the pope.

The schism is generally considered to have started in 1054, when the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael I Cerularius, and the Papal Legate, Humbert of Silva Candida, issued mutual excommunications; in 1965, these excommunications were revoked by both Rome and Constantinople. In spite of that event, for many years both churches continued to maintain friendly relations and seemed to be unaware of any formal or final rupture.

However, estrangement continued. In 1190, Eastern Orthodox theologian Theodore Balsamon, who was patriarch of Antioch, wrote that &quot;no Latin should be given Communion unless he first declares that he will abstain from the doctrines and customs that separate him from us&quot;.

Later in 1204, Constantinople was sacked by the Catholic armies of the Fourth Crusade, whereas two decades previously the Massacre of the Latins (i.e., Catholics) had occurred in Constantinople in 1182. Thus, by the 12th–13th centuries, the two sides had become openly hostile, each considering that the other no longer belonged to the church that was orthodox and catholic. Over time, it became customary to refer to the Eastern side as the Orthodox Church and the Western as the Catholic Church, without either side thereby renouncing its claim of being the truly orthodox or the truly catholic church.

====Attempts at restoring communion====

Parties within many non-Latin churches repeatedly sought to organize efforts to restore communion. In 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focused on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Several eastern churches associated themselves with Rome, forming Eastern Catholic churches. The See of Rome accepted them without requiring that they adopt the customs of the Latin Church, so that they all have their own &quot;liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary heritage, differentiated by peoples&#x27; culture and historical circumstances, that finds expression in each &quot;&quot; Church&#x27;s own way of living the faith&quot;.

===Emergence of the churches===
Most Eastern Catholic churches arose when a group within an ancient church in disagreement with the See of Rome returned to full communion with that see. The following churches have been in communion with the Bishop of Rome for a large part of their history:
* The Maronite Church, which has no counterpart in Byzantine, nor Oriental, Orthodoxy. The Maronite Church has historical connections to the Monothelite controversy in the 7th century. It re-affirmed unity with the Holy See in 1154 during the Crusades.
**The Maronite Church has historically been treated as never having fully schismed with the Holy See, despite a dispute over Christological doctrine that concluded in 1154; most of the other Eastern Catholic churches came into being from the 16th century onwards. However, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Syro-Malabar Church and the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church also claim perpetual communion.
* The Albanian Greek Catholic Church and Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, which, unlike the Maronite Church, use the same liturgical rite as the Eastern Orthodox Church.
* The former Melkite Church considered itself in dual communion with Rome and Constantinople until an exclusively Orthodox body was formed in the 18th century, leaving a remainder unified exclusively with Rome as the Melkite Greek Catholic Church.
* The Oriental Orthodox Armenian Apostolic Church had included a long-standing minority that accepted Roman primacy until the Armenian Catholic Church was officially established in the 18th century.

The canon law shared by all Eastern Catholic churches, , was codified in 1990. The dicastery that works with the Eastern Catholic churches is the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches, which by law includes as members all Eastern Catholic patriarchs and major archbishops.

The largest six churches based on membership are, in order, the Syro-Malabar Church (East Syriac Rite), the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC; Byzantine Rite), the Maronite Church (West Syriac Rite), the Melkite Greek Catholic Church (Byzantine Rite), the Chaldean Catholic Church (East Syriac Rite), and the Armenian Catholic Church (Armenian Rite). These six churches account for about 85% of the membership of the Eastern Catholic Churches.

===&quot;Orientalium dignitas&quot;===

On 30 November 1894, Pope Leo XIII issued the apostolic constitution &quot;Orientalium dignitas&quot;, in which he stated:
Adrian Fortescue wrote that Leo XIII &quot;begins by explaining again that the ancient Eastern rites are a witness to the Apostolicity of the Catholic Church, that their diversity, consistent with unity of the faith, is itself a witness to the unity of the Church, that they add to her dignity and honour. He says that the Catholic Church does not possess one rite only, but that she embraces all the ancient rites of Christendom; her unity consists not in a mechanical uniformity of all her parts, but on the contrary, in their variety, according in one principle and vivified by it.&quot;

Leo XIII declared still in force Pope Benedict XIV&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Demandatam&quot;, addressed to the Patriarch and the Bishops of the Melkite Catholic Church, in which Benedict XIV forbade Latin Church clergy to induce Melkite Catholics to transfer to the Roman Rite, and he broadened this prohibition to cover all Eastern Catholics, declaring: &quot;Any Latin rite missionary, whether of the secular or religious clergy, who induces with his advice or assistance any Eastern rite faithful to transfer to the Latin rite, will be deposed and excluded from his benefice in addition to the &quot;ipso facto&quot; suspension &quot;a divinis&quot; and other punishments that he will incur as imposed in the aforesaid Constitution &quot;Demandatam&quot;.&quot;

===Second Vatican Council===

There had been confusion on the part of Western clergy about the legitimate presence of Eastern Catholic Churches in countries seen as belonging to the West, despite firm and repeated papal confirmation of these Churches&#x27; universal character. The Second Vatican Council brought the reform impulse to visible fruition. Several documents, from both during and after the Second Vatican Council, have led to significant reform and development within Eastern Catholic Churches.

====&quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot;====
The Second Vatican Council directed, in &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot;, that the traditions of Eastern Catholic Churches should be maintained. It declared that &quot;it is the mind of the Catholic Church that each individual Church or Rite should retain its traditions whole and entire and likewise that it should adapt its way of life to the different needs of time and place&quot; (n. 2), and that they should all &quot;preserve their legitimate liturgical rite and their established way of life, and ... these may not be altered except to obtain for themselves an organic improvement&quot; (n. 6; cf. n. 22).

It confirmed and approved the ancient discipline of the sacraments existing in the Eastern churches, and the ritual practices connected with their celebration and administration, and declared its ardent desire that this should be re-established if circumstances warranted (n. 12). It applied this in particular to administration of sacrament of Confirmation by priests (n. 13). It expressed the wish that, where the permanent diaconate (ordination as deacons of men who are not intended afterwards to become priests) had fallen into disuse, it should be restored (n. 17).

Paragraphs 7–11 are devoted to the powers of the patriarchs and major archbishops of the Eastern Churches, whose rights and privileges, it says, should be re-established in accordance with the ancient tradition of each of the Churches and the decrees of the ecumenical councils, adapted somewhat to modern conditions. Where there is a need, new patriarchates should be established either by an ecumenical council or by the Bishop of Rome.

====&quot;Lumen gentium&quot;====
The Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, deals with Eastern Catholic Churches in paragraph 23, stating:

====&quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot;====
The 1964 decree &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot; deals with Eastern Catholic Churches in paragraphs 14–17.

===Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches===

The First Vatican Council discussed the need for a common code for the Eastern churches, but no concrete action was taken. Only after the benefits of the Latin Church&#x27;s 1917 Code of Canon Law were appreciated was a serious effort made to codify the Eastern Catholic Churches&#x27; canon laws. This came to fruition with the promulgation of the 1990 &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot;, which took effect in 1991. It is a framework document that contains canons that are a consequence of the &quot;common&quot; patrimony of the churches of the East: each individual &quot;&quot; church also has its own canons, its own particular law, layered on top of this code.

===Joint International Commission===

In 1993 the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church submitted the document &quot;Uniatism, method of union of the past, and the present search for full communion&quot;, also known as the Balamand declaration, &quot;to the authorities of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches for approval and application,&quot;
which stated that initiatives that &quot;led to the union of certain communities with the See of Rome and brought with them, as a consequence, the breaking of communion with their Mother Churches of the East ... took place not without the interference of extra-ecclesial interests&quot;.

Likewise the commission acknowledged that &quot;certain civil authorities [who] made attempts&quot; to force Eastern Catholics to return to the Orthodox Church used &quot;unacceptable means&quot;. The missionary outlook and proselytism that accompanied the Unia was judged incompatible with the rediscovery by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches of each other as Sister Churches. Thus the commission concluded that the &quot;missionary apostolate, ... which has been called &#x27;uniatism&#x27;, can no longer be accepted either as a method to be followed or as a model of the unity our Churches are seeking.&quot;

At the same time, the commission stated:
* that Eastern Catholic Churches, being part of the Catholic Communion, have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful;
* that Oriental Catholic Churches, which desired to re-establish full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to it, have the rights and obligations connected with this communion.
These principles were repeated in the 2016 Joint Declaration of Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill, which stated that &#x27;It is today clear that the past method of “uniatism”, understood as the union of one community to the other, separating it from its Church, is not the way to re-establish unity. Nonetheless, the ecclesial communities which emerged in these historical circumstances have the right to exist and to undertake all that is necessary to meet the spiritual needs of their faithful, while seeking to live in peace with their neighbours. Orthodox and Greek Catholics are in need of reconciliation and of mutually acceptable forms of co–existence.&#x27;

===Liturgical prescriptions===
The 1996 &quot;Instruction for Applying the Liturgical Prescriptions of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; brought together, in one place, the developments that took place in previous texts, and is &quot;an expository expansion based upon the canons, with constant emphasis upon the preservation of Eastern liturgical traditions and a return to those usages whenever possible—certainly in preference to the usages of the Latin Church, however much some principles and norms of the conciliar constitution on the Roman rite, &quot;in the very nature of things, affect other rites as well.&quot; The &quot;Instruction&quot; states:

Past interventions by the Holy See, the Instruction said, were in some ways defective and needed revision, but often served also as a safeguard against aggressive initiatives.
==Organisation==

===Papal supreme authority===

Under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, the pope has supreme, full, immediate and universal ordinary authority in the whole Catholic Church, which he can always freely exercise, including the Eastern Catholic churches.

===Eastern patriarchs and major archbishops===
The Catholic patriarchs and major archbishops derive their titles from the sees of Alexandria (Coptic), Antioch (Syriac, Melkite, Maronite), Baghdad (Chaldean), Cilicia (Armenian), Kyiv-Halych (Ukrainian), Ernakulam-Angamaly (Syro-Malabar), Trivandrum (Syro-Malankara), and Făgăraş-Alba Iulia (Romanian). The Eastern Catholic churches are governed in accordance with Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches and their particular laws.

Within their proper &quot;&quot; churches there is no difference between patriarchs and major archbishops. However, differences exist in the order of precedence (i.e. patriarchs take precedence over major archbishops) and in the mode of accession: The election of a major archbishop has to be confirmed by the pope before he may take office. No papal confirmation is needed for newly elected patriarchs before they take office. They are just required to request as soon as possible that the pope grant them full ecclesiastical communion.

===Variants of organizational structure===
There are significant differences between various Eastern Catholic churches, regarding their present organizational structure. Major Eastern Catholic churches, that are headed by their patriarchs, major archbishops or metropolitans, have fully developed structure and functioning internal autonomy based on the existence of ecclesiastical provinces. On the other hand, minor Eastern Catholic churches often have only one or two hierarchs (in the form of eparchs, apostolic exarchs, or apostolic visitors) and only the most basic forms of internal organization if any, like the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church or the Russian Greek Catholic Church. Individual eparchies of some Eastern Catholic churches may be suffragan to Latin metropolitans. For example, the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci is suffragan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb. Also, some minor Eastern Catholic churches have Latin prelates. For example, the Macedonian Greek Catholic Church is organized as a single Eparchy of Strumica-Skopje, whose present ordinary is the Roman Catholic bishop of Skopje. The organization of the Albanian Greek Catholic Church is unique in that it consists of an &quot;Apostolic Administration&quot;.

===Juridical status===

Although every diocese in the Catholic Church is considered a particular church, the word is not applied in the same sense as to the 24 &quot; particular churches: the Latin Church and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.

Canonically, each Eastern Catholic Church is &quot; or autonomous with respect to other Catholic churches, whether Latin or Eastern, though all accept the spiritual and juridical supreme authority of the pope. Thus a Maronite Catholic is normally directly subject only to a Maronite bishop. However, if members of a particular church are so few that no hierarchy of their own has been established, their spiritual care is entrusted to a bishop of another ritual church. For instance, members of the Latin Church in Eritrea are under the care of the Eastern rite Eritrean Catholic Church, whereas the other way around may be the case in other parts of the world.

Theologically, all the particular churches can be viewed as &quot;sister churches&quot;. According to the Second Vatican Council these Eastern Catholic churches, along with the larger Latin Church, share &quot;equal dignity, so that none of them is superior to the others as regards rite, and they enjoy the same rights and are under the same obligations, also in respect of preaching the Gospel to the whole world (cf. ) under the guidance of the Roman Pontiff.&quot;
The Eastern Catholic churches are in full communion with the whole Catholic Church. While they accept the canonical authority of the Holy See of Rome, they retain their distinctive liturgical rites, laws, customs and traditional devotions, and have their own theological emphases. Terminology may vary: for instance, &quot;diocese&quot; and &quot;eparchy&quot;, &quot;vicar general&quot; and &quot;protosyncellus&quot;, &quot;confirmation&quot; and &quot;chrismation&quot; are respectively Western and Eastern terms for the same realities. The mysteries (sacraments) of baptism and chrismation are generally administered, according to the ancient tradition of the church, one immediately after the other. Infants who are baptized and chrismated are also given the Eucharist.

The Eastern Catholic churches are represented in the Holy See and the Roman Curia through the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches, which is &quot;made up of a Cardinal Prefect (who directs and represents it with the help of a Secretary) and 27 cardinals, one archbishop and 4 bishops, designated by the pope &quot;&quot; (for a five-year period). Members by right are the Patriarchs and the Major Archbishops of the Oriental Churches and the President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Unity among Christians.&quot;

===Bi-ritual faculties===

While &quot;clerics and members of institutes of consecrated life are bound to observe their own rite faithfully&quot;, priests are occasionally given permission to celebrate the liturgy of a rite other than the priest&#x27;s own rite, by what is known as a grant of &quot;biritual faculties&quot;. The reason for this permission is usually the service of Catholics who have no priest of their own rite. Thus priests of the Syro-Malabar Church working as missionaries in areas of India in which there are no structures of their own Church, are authorized to use the Roman Rite in those areas, and Latin priests are, after due preparation, given permission to use an Eastern rite for the service of members of an Eastern Catholic Church living in a country in which there are no priests of their own particular Church. Popes are permitted to celebrate a Mass or Divine Liturgy of any rite in testament to the Catholic Church&#x27;s universal nature. John Paul II celebrated the Divine Liturgy in Ukraine during his pontificate.

For a just cause, and with the permission of the local bishop, priests of different autonomous ritual Churches may concelebrate; however, the rite of the principal celebrant is used whilst each priest wears the vestments of his own rite. No indult of bi-ritualism is required for this.

Biritual faculties may concern not only clergy but also religious, enabling them to become members of an institute of an autonomous Church other than their own.

===Clerical celibacy===
Eastern and Western Christian churches have different traditions concerning clerical celibacy and the resulting controversies have played a role in the relationship between the two groups in some Western countries.

In general, Eastern Catholic Churches have always allowed ordination of married men as priests and deacons. Within the lands of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the third largest Eastern Catholic Church, where 90% of the diocesan priests in Ukraine are married, priests&#x27; children often became priests and married within their social group, establishing a tightly knit hereditary caste.

Most Eastern Churches distinguish between &quot;monastic&quot; and &quot;non-monastic&quot; clergy. Monastics do not necessarily live in monasteries, but have spent at least part of their period of training in such a context. Their monastic vows include a vow of celibate chastity.

Bishops are normally selected from the monastic clergy, and in most Eastern Catholic Churches a large percentage of priests and deacons also are celibate, while a large portion of the parish priests are married, having taken a wife when they were still laymen. If someone preparing for the diaconate or priesthood wishes to marry, this must happen before ordination.

In territories where Eastern traditions prevail, married clergy caused little controversy, but aroused opposition inside traditionally Latin Church territories to which Eastern Catholics migrated; this was particularly so in the United States. In response to requests from the Latin bishops of those countries, the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith set out rules in an 1890 letter to François-Marie-Benjamin Richard, archbishop of Paris, which the Congregation applied on 1 May 1897 to the United States, stating that only celibates or widowed priests coming without their children should be permitted in the United States.

This celibacy mandate for Eastern Catholic priests in the United States was restated with special reference to Ruthenians by the 1 March 1929 decree &quot;Cum data fuerit&quot;, which was renewed for a further ten years in 1939. Dissatisfaction by many Ruthenian Catholics in the United States gave rise to the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese. The mandate, which applied in some other countries also, was removed by a decree of June 2014.

While most Eastern Catholic Churches admit married men to ordination as priests (although not allowing priests to marry after ordination), some have adopted mandatory clerical celibacy, as in the Latin Church. These include the India-based Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, and the Coptic Catholic Church.

In 2014, Pope Francis approved new norms for married clergy within Eastern Catholic Churches through canon 758 § 3. The new norms abrogated previous norms and now allow those Eastern Catholic Churches with married clergy to ordain married men inside traditionally Latin territories and to grant faculties inside traditionally Latin territories to married Eastern Catholic clergy previously ordained elsewhere. This latter change will allow married Eastern Catholic priests to follow their faithful to whatever country they may immigrate to, addressing an issue which has arisen with the exodus of so many Christians from Eastern Europe and the Middle East in recent decades.

==List of Eastern Catholic churches==
The Holy See&#x27;s &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; gives the following list of Eastern Catholic churches with the principal episcopal see of each and the countries (or larger political areas) where they have ecclesiastical jurisdiction, to which are here added the date of union or foundation in parentheses and the membership in brackets. The total membership for all Eastern Catholic churches is at least 18,047,000 people.


==Persecution==
===Eastern Europe===

A study by Methodios Stadnik states: &quot;The Georgian Byzantine Catholic Exarch, Fr. Shio , and two Georgian Catholic priests of the Latin Church were executed by the Soviet authorities in 1937 after having been held in captivity in Solovki prison and the northern gulags from 1923.&quot; Christopher Zugger writes, in &quot;The Forgotten&quot;: &quot;By 1936, the Byzantine Catholic Church of Georgia had two communities, served by a bishop and four priests, with 8,000 believers&quot;, and he identifies the bishop as Shio Batmalashvili. mentions, on the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union website, that &quot;the Catholic administrator for Georgia Shio Batmalashvili&quot; was one of those executed as &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot; in 1937.

Zugger calls Batmalashvili a bishop; Stadnik is ambiguous, calling him an exarch but giving him the title of Father; Ovsiyenko merely refers to him as &quot;the Catholic administrator&quot; without specifying whether he was a bishop or a priest and whether he was in charge of a Latin or a Byzantine jurisdiction.

If Batmalashvili was an &quot;exarch&quot;, and not instead a bishop connected with the Latin diocese of Tiraspol, which had its seat at Saratov on the Volga River, to which Georgian Catholics even of Byzantine rite belonged this would mean that a Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholic Church existed, even if only as a local particular Church. However, since the establishment of a new hierarchical jurisdiction must be published in &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot;, and no mention of the setting up of such a jurisdiction for Byzantine Georgian Catholics exists in that official gazette of the Holy See, the claim appears to be unfounded.

The 1930s editions of &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; do not mention Batmalashvili. If indeed he was a bishop, he may then have been one of those secretly ordained for the service of the Church in the Soviet Union by French Jesuit Bishop Michel d&#x27;Herbigny, who was president of the Pontifical Commission for Russia from 1925 to 1934. In the circumstances of that time, the Holy See would have been incapable of setting up a new Byzantine exarchate within the Soviet Union, since Greek Catholics in the Soviet Union were being forced to join the Russian Orthodox Church.

Batmalashvili&#x27;s name is not among those given in as the four &quot;underground&quot; apostolic administrators (only one of whom appears to have been a bishop) for the four sections into which the diocese of Tiraspol was divided after the resignation in 1930 of its already exiled last bishop, Josef Alois Kessler. This source gives Father Stefan Demurow as apostolic administrator of &quot;Tbilisi and Georgia&quot; and says he was executed in 1938. Other sources associate Demurow with Azerbaijan and say that, rather than being executed, he died in a Siberian Gulag.

Until 1994, the United States annual publication &quot;Catholic Almanac&quot; listed &quot;Georgian&quot; among the Greek Catholic churches. Until corrected in 1995, it appears to have been also making a mistake about the Czech Greek Catholics.

There was a short-lived Greek Catholic movement among the ethnic Estonians in the Orthodox Church in Estonia during the interwar period of the 20th century, consisting of two to three parishes, not raised to the level of a local particular church with its own head. This group was liquidated by the Soviet regime and is now extinct.

===Muslim world===

Muslim persecution of Christians dates back to the founding of Islam, and continues to this day. Countries in which Christians have suffered acute discrimination, persecution and often death include: Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, Pakistan, Iran, Yemen, Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Eritrea, United Arab Emirates, and North Caucasus.

===United States===
While not subject to the kind of physical dangers or persecution from government authorities encountered in Eastern Europe or the Middle East, adherents of Eastern Catholic Churches in United States, most of whom were relatively new immigrants from Eastern Europe, encountered difficulties due to hostility from the Latin Church clergy who dominated the Catholic hierarchy in United States who found them alien. In particular, immigration of Eastern Catholic priests who were married, common in their churches but extremely rare in Latin churches, was forbidden or severely limited and some Latin Church bishops actively interfered with the pastoral work of those who did arrive. Some bishops sought to forbid all non-Latin Catholic priests from coming to United States at all. Many Eastern Catholic immigrants to United States were thus either assimilated into the Latin Church or joined the Eastern Orthodox Church. One former Eastern Catholic priest, Alexis Toth, left the Catholic Church following criticism and sanctions from Latin authorities including John Ireland, the Bishop of Saint Paul, and joining the Orthodox Church. Toth has been canonized as an Eastern Orthodox saint for having led as many as 20,000 disaffected former Eastern Catholics to the Orthodox Church, particularly the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese.

<text>The term Islamic republic has been used in different ways. Some Muslim religious leaders have used it as the name for a form of Islamic theocratic government enforcing sharia, or laws compatible with sharia. The term has also been used for a sovereign state taking a compromise position between a purely Islamic caliphate and a secular, nationalist republic.

The term is currently used in the official title of three states — the Islamic Republics of Iran, Pakistan, and Mauritania. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Despite having similar names, the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws. 

Iran and Mauritania are religious theocratic states. Pakistan adopted the name in 1956 before Islam was yet to be declared the state religion, this happened at the adoption of the 1973 constitution.

Iran officially uses the full title in all governance names referring to the country (e.g. the Islamic Republic of Iran Army or the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting); as opposed to its equivalents in Pakistan which are called the Pakistan Armed Forces and the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation. Also, unlike the other countries, Iran uses the IRI acronym (Islamic Republic of Iran) as part of official acronyms.

The creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran was a dramatic, historical event, following the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979 by the Islamic revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. &quot;Islamic&quot; in the country&#x27;s title was not a symbol of cultural identity, but indicated specific governmental system based on rule by Islamic jurists enforcing Islamic law. The system was based on &quot;The Jurist&#x27;s Guardianship: Islamic Government&quot;, a work of the revolution&#x27;s leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, written before Khomeini came to power, and known by Khomeini&#x27;s followers but not by the general public. It argued that rather than elections and legislators, Islam required traditional Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;), and proper enforcement of sharia required a leading Islamic jurist (&quot;faqih&quot;) (such as Khomeini himself, who served as the first &quot;faqih&quot; &quot;guardian&quot; or Supreme Leader of Iran) to provide political &quot;guardianship&quot; (&quot;wilayat&quot; or &quot;velayat&quot;) over the people and nation (wilayat al-faqih). All the Muslim world should be united in such a state. With it, the entire non-Muslim world will evidentially &quot;capitulate&quot; to its courage and vigor; without it, Islam would fall victim to heresy, &quot;obsolescence and decay&quot;. 

The new government held a referendum for public approval to change Iran from a monarchy to an Islamic republic in March 1979, two months after the Islamic Revolution took power. While some political groups had suggested various names for the ideology of the Iranian revolution such as the Republic (without specifying Islam) or the Democratic Republic; Khomeini called for Iranians to vote for the name Islamic Republic, &quot;not a word more and not a word less&quot;. When an Iranian journalist asked Khomeini what exactly Islamic Republic meant, Khomeini stated that the term republic has the same sense as other uses and Islamic republic has considered both Islamic ideology and the choice of people. 

The day after the vote was complete, it was announced that 98.2% of the Iranian voters had voted to approve the new name.

Unlike Khomeini&#x27;s original vision, the Islamic Republic is a &quot;republic&quot; with elections (Khomeini had originally described his &quot;Islamic government&quot; as &quot;not ... based on the approval of laws in accordance with the opinion of the majority&quot;); it has many of the trappings of a modern state—a president, cabinet and legislature (Khomeini mentioned none of these except for the legislature, which his government would not have because &quot;no one has the right to legislate ... except ... the Divine Legislator&quot;). Some, however, have argued that the legislature (and president, etc.) has been kept in a subordinate position in keeping with Khomeini&#x27;s idea of government being a guardianship by jurists.

According to the constitution, the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system based on the following beliefs:
=== Mauritania ===
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is a country in the Maghreb region of western North Africa. Mauritania was declared an independent state as the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, on November 28, 1960. Its legal system is &quot;a mix of French civil law and Sharia Law&quot;, and its Penal Code punishes crimes against religion and “good morals” with &quot;harsh sentences&quot;. &quot;Heresy or apostasy (including in print) are &quot;punishable by death&quot;. 

=== Pakistan ===
Pakistan was created as a homeland for the Muslims of British India, when British India was given independence, making Islam its raison d&#x27;être. It was the first country to adopt the adjective Islamic to modify its republican status under its otherwise secular constitution in 1956. Despite this definition, the country did not have a state religion until 1973, when a new constitution, more democratic and less secular, was adopted. Pakistan only uses the Islamic name on its passports, visas and coins. Although Islamic Republic is specifically mentioned in the constitution of 1973, all government documents are prepared under the name of the Government of Pakistan. The Constitution of Pakistan, Part IX, Article 227 states: &quot;All existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah, in this Part referred to as the Injunctions of Islam, and no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to such Injunctions&quot;.

== Former ==
=== Chechen Republic of Ichkeria ===
The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria used an Islamic republic government system from 1996 to 2000.

=== Comoros ===
Between 1978 and 2001, the Comoros was the Federal and Islamic Republic of the Comoros. 

=== East Turkestan ===
The Turkic Uyghur- and Kirghiz-controlled Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan was declared in 1933 as an independent Islamic republic by Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki and Muhammad Amin Bughra. However, the Chinese Muslim 36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army defeated their armies and destroyed the republic during the Battles of Kashgar, Yangi Hissar and Yarkand. The Chinese Muslim Generals Ma Fuyuan and Ma Zhancang declared the destruction of the rebel forces and the return of the area to the control of the Republic of China in 1934, followed by the executions of the Turkic Muslim Emirs Abdullah Bughra and Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra. The Chinese Muslim General Ma Zhongying then entered the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar and lectured the Turkic Muslims on being loyal to the Nationalist Government.

=== Afghanistan ===
Afghanistan was an Islamic republic from 1990 to 1996, and from 2001 to 2021. The 1990 constitution was imposed by the Mohammad Najibullah government and eliminated communism.

The constitution formed in 2004 was very similar to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, created when Afghanistan was a constitutional Islamic monarchy. It consisted of three branches, the executive, the legislative and the judicial. The National Assembly was the legislature, a bicameral body having two chambers, the House of the People and the House of Elders. The Islamic prefix to Republic was considered symbolic as it was a name supported by pro-Mujahideen delegates during the assembly of forming the constitution.

In 2021, the Taliban initiated a month-long insurgency to effectively end the Islamic republic and ultimately, re-establish the theocratic Islamic Emirate in August 2021. The Islamic Republic continued to be recognized by the United Nations as the legitimate government of Afghanistan both from 1996 to 2001 and from 2021 onwards.

===The Gambia ===
In December 2015, the then-president Yahya Jammeh declared The Gambia to be an Islamic republic. Jammeh said that the move was designed to distance the West African state from its colonial past, that no dress code would be imposed and that citizens of other faiths would be allowed to practice freely. However, he later ordered all female government employees to wear headscarves before rescinding the decision shortly after. The announcement of an Islamic republic has been criticized as unconstitutional by at least one opposition group. After the removal of Jammeh in 2017, his successor Adama Barrow said the Gambia would no longer be an Islamic republic.

<doc id="214909" wikidata="Q366796" url="?curid=214909" title="Essad Toptani">
<text>Essad Toptani (1863/1875 – 13 June 1920) was an Albanian politician who served as the third prime minister of Albania from 1914 to 1916. He previously established the Republic of Central Albania based in Durrës. An Ottoman army officer, he served as the Albanian deputy in the Ottoman Parliament and later cooperated with the Balkan League after the Balkan Wars.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Essad Toptani was born in 1863 in Tirana, Ottoman Empire (modern Republic of Albania), the son of Ali Toptani and Vasfije Alizoti. He was a member of the Toptani family, a prominent landowning Albanian noble family who helped found the current city of Tirana. From his mothers side of the family he was first cousins with Aqif Pasha Biçakçiu and his family as both their mothers were sisters. During Ottoman rule, Toptani served as a kaymakam and had command of the gendarmerie in Tirana. In 1908 Janina, he joined the Young Turks and the Ottoman parliament. In the aftermath of the 31 March incident, on 27 April 1909 four CUP members went to inform Sultan Abdul Hamid II () of his dethronement, with Toptani being the main messenger saying &quot;the nation has deposed you&quot;. As a result, the focus of the sultan&#x27;s rage was toward Toptani whom Abdul Hamid II felt had betrayed him. The sultan referred to him as a &quot;wicked man&quot;, given that the extended Toptani family had benefited from royal patronage in gaining privileges and key positions in the Ottoman government.

=== First Balkan War ===

In 1912 during the Albanian revolt and aftermath of the Ottoman parliamentary elections, parliamentarians Toptani and Syrja Vlora represented the Albanian side in a parliamentary discussion with the Young Turks. Both called for the cessation of government force and implementation of good governance to alleviate the situation in Albanian lands. Amidst the Albanian Revolt of 1912 Toptani obliged himself to organize the uprising in Central Albania and Mirdita. On 30 January 1913, Hasan Riza Pasha, commander of Shkodër, was ambushed and killed by unknown men disguised as women, thought to be Osman Bali and Mehmet Kavaja, two Albanian officers of Toptani. Riza Pasha wanted to keep up the defense of the besieged city, and after his death Toptani continued his resistance until April 1913. He turned the fortress of Shkodër over to Montenegro, only in April 1913 after a prolonged war and great heroism of Albanian and Turkish soldiers.

In July 1913, he was persuaded by the Vlora family to accept a position of minister of the interior in the provisional government.

=== Peasant Revolt ===

Toptani led a faction of his own in the Peasant Revolt against Prince Wilhem.

On 19 May 1914, when Toptani refused to lay down his weapons, armed forces under Dutch gendarmerie officer Johan Sluys surrounded and shelled his house in Durrës, forcing him to surrender. He was arrested for conspiracy, though after consultations with Wilhelm, he was not court-martialled but sent to Bari in southern Italy and banned from returning to Albania.

=== Exile and the Treaty of Niš ===
After the outbreak of the First World War, Toptani travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić signed the secret Treaty of Niš on 17 September 1914. With Italian and Serbian financial backing, he established armed forces, Toptani invaded Dibër on 20 September, and by 3 October 1914 he had taken Durrës without a fight. Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić ordered that his followers be aided with money and arms.

Toptani&#x27;s rule was not stable because of the First World War. At the end of 1914, Essad secretly agreed with the Greek government to support the annexation of the southern provinces, known to Greeks as Northern Epirus, to the Kingdom of Greece. During the Serbian army’s retreat through Albania in 1915, troops under Toptani&#x27;s command gave support and protection to the Serbian column where possible.

== Death ==
On 13 June 1920, Avni Rustemi shot and killed Toptani in Paris when he left the Hotel Continental. Toptani was buried in the Serbian Military section of the Thiais cemetery in Paris, after staying for a long time unburied in the mortuary.

== Legacy ==

=== Awards ===

For his service in the Greco-Turkish War (1897), the High Porte awarded him with the Order of Osmanieh of 2nd Class and afterwards he was ranked Miralay. Furthermore, for his contribution in the Macedonian front as an ally of the Entente, he was awarded with the title &quot;Officier&quot; of the Legion of Honour and with the Croix de Guerre. He was awarded Order of the White Eagle.

=== Historical ===

Edith Durham described Toptani as &quot;a strange relic of the middle ages ... one with the handsome swashbucklers who sold themselves and their services to the rival monarchs, princelings and dukes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and cheerfully transferred themselves to the enemy if he offered better pay – men in whom the sense of nationality was not developed at all, and whose sense of honor was, to put it mildly, deficient.&quot;

=== Perception ===

Toptani is remembered among Albanians as one of the most negative historical figures and the symbol of treason.

In 2014, the Serbian Minister of Labor, Aleksandar Vulin paid homage at his grave, for his contributions to Serbia.

== In popular culture ==

&quot;Two Shots In Paris&quot; &quot;(:sq:Dy krisma në Paris)&quot; is a drama by Sheri Mita, Pëllumb Kulla with the subject of Essad Toptani murder in Paris and trial of Avni Rustemi.

<text>Otidae is a clade that includes the superorders Otidimorphae (bustards, turacos, and cuckoos) and Strisores (nightbirds, swifts, and hummingbirds). It was identified in 2014 by genome analysis. Earlier it was thought that Strisores was closely related to birds such as pigeons, flamingos, tropicbirds, and the sunbittern and kagu in the taxon Metaves, but subsequent work has provided evidence that Metaves is polyphyletic. Although analyses of genome data provided relatively high support for monophyly of Otidae, indicating that it is sister to all other Passerea clades, other analyses of large data matrices have not recovered a clade comprising Otidimorphae and Strisores, raising questions about the monophyly of Otidae.

<text>Uncle Cleans Up (1965) is a children&#x27;s story written by J. P. Martin as part of his &quot;Uncle&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
In this story, Goodman the Cat joins Uncle&#x27;s supporters. He is rescued from down-trodden and hungry service at Wizard Blenkinsop&#x27;s and throws himself wholeheartedly into battle against Uncle&#x27;s enemies, though never quite ridding himself of a propensity to steal fish and postage stamps. His fish-stealing gets him into trouble at Professor Gandleweaver&#x27;s Fish-Frying Academy, and Uncle is forced to make a dignified exit as the crowd gathered to watch Gandleweaver&#x27;s frying exhibition turns ugly:

:The crowd began to hiss, and, as Uncle didn&#x27;t want a row, he decided to withdraw and take action later. The moment he and his party got out of the crowd, they were forgotten. The Professor had started frying a conger eel in an enormous pan, and this is one of star turns; and nobody thinks about anything else when he does it.

The incident is seized on by the Badfort Crowd and written up in the usual lying and distorted way in &quot;The Badfort News&quot;, one of the many provocations offered by the newspaper that eventually lead Uncle to take action against it. Visiting its offices, he finds a young badger literally chained to the printing-press, whom he rescues before visiting well-deserved punishment on Beaver Hateman by kicking him far and high into Gaby&#x27;s Marsh, where &quot;the crabs are&quot; and &quot;the barking conger eels&quot;. As before, &quot;Uncle Cleans Up&quot; ends in Uncle&#x27;s capture by the Badfort Crowd before he escapes, this time with the help of his loyal friend the Old Monkey, and a great battle is fought in which the Badfort Crowd are completely defeated—until next time. The last that is seen of Beaver Hateman is this:

:Even for Uncle it was a great kick-up. Beaver Hateman was holding a huge lighted cigar in his hand, and the wind made it glow so that everyone could see in the sky what looked like a slowly soaring red light.

He comes down in Gaby&#x27;s Marsh again, and vows in an insolent letter delivered to Uncle as the book closes that he will take a revenge &quot;so fearful that anyone who speaks of it will develop lockjaw&quot;.

<text>Friedrich Heinrich Karl de la Motte, Baron Fouqué (; 12 February 1777 – 23 January 1843) was a German writer of the Romantic style.

==Biography==

He was born at Brandenburg an der Havel, of a family of French Huguenot origin, as evidenced in his family name. His grandfather, Heinrich August de la Motte Fouqué, had been one of Frederick the Great&#x27;s generals and his father was a Prussian army officer.

Although not originally intended for a military career, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué ultimately gave up his university studies at Halle to join the army, and he took part in the Rhine campaign of 1794. The rest of his life was devoted mainly to literary pursuits. He was introduced to August Wilhelm Schlegel, who deeply influenced him as a poet (&quot;mich gelehret Maß und Regel | Meister August Wilhelm Schlegel&quot;) and who published Fouqué&#x27;s first book, &quot;Dramatische Spiele von Pellegrin&quot;, in 1804.

===Marriage===
Fouqué&#x27;s first marriage was unhappy and soon ended in divorce. His second wife, Caroline Philippine von Briest (1773–1831), enjoyed some reputation as a novelist in her day. After her death Fouqué married a third time. Some consolation for the ebbing tide of popular favour was afforded him by the munificence of Frederick William IV of Prussia, who granted him a pension which allowed him to spend his later years in comfort. He died in Berlin in 1843.

For Fouqué&#x27;s life see &quot;Lebensgeschichte des Baron Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué (only to the year 1813), Aufgezeichnet durch ihn selbst&quot; (Halle, 1840), and also the introduction to Koch&#x27;s selections in the &quot;Deutsche Nationalliteratur&quot;.

==Literary work==
===Romantic roots===

After &quot;Dramatische Spiele von Pellegrin&quot;, his second work, &quot;Romanzen vom Tal Ronceval&quot; (1805), showed more plainly his allegiance to the romantic leaders, and in the &quot;Historie vom edlen Ritter Galmy&quot; (1806) he versified a 16th-century romance of medieval chivalry.

&quot;Sigurd der Schlangentödter, ein Heldenspiel in sechs Abentheuren&quot; (1808), was the first modern German dramatization of the Nibelung legend combining Icelandic sources such as the Volsunga Saga and the Middle High German Nibelungenlied. The play and its two sequels &quot;Sigurds Rache&quot; (1809) and &quot;Aslaugas Ritter&quot; (1810) were published together under the title &quot;Der Held des Nordens&quot; in 1810 [&quot;The Hero of the North&quot;]. The trilogy brought Fouqué to the attention of the public, and had a considerable influence on subsequent versions of the story, such as Friedrich Hebbel&#x27;s &quot;Nibelungen&quot; and Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;.

These early writings indicate the lines which Fouqué&#x27;s subsequent literary activity followed; his interests were divided between medieval chivalry on the one hand and northern mythology on the other. In 1813, the year of the rising against Napoleon, he again fought with the Prussian army, and the new patriotism awakened in the German people left its mark upon his writings.

===Popular works===

Between 1810 and 1815, Fouqué&#x27;s popularity was at its height; the many romances and novels, plays and epics which he produced with extraordinary rapidity, appealed greatly to the mood of the hour. &quot;Undine&quot; appeared around 1811, the only work by which Fouqué&#x27;s memory still lives today. A more comprehensive idea of his talent may, however, be obtained from the two romances &quot;Der Zauberring&quot; (1813) and &quot;Die Fahrten Thiodolfs des Isländers&quot; (1815).

===Later years===
From 1820 onwards the quality of Fouqué&#x27;s work deteriorated, partly owing to the fatal formal ease with which he wrote, and he failed to keep pace with the changes in German taste by clinging to the paraphernalia of romanticism. His rivals applied a sobriquet of &quot;Don Quixote of Romanticism&quot; to him.

===Translations===
Most of Fouqué&#x27;s works have been translated. Menella Bute Smedley, for instance, translated his ballad, &quot;The Shepherd of the Giant Mountains.&quot; The English versions of &quot;Aslauga&#x27;s Knight&quot; (by Thomas Carlyle), &quot;Sintram and his Companions&quot; and &quot;Undine&quot; have been frequently republished. A number of his short stories were translated in &quot;Popular Tales and Romances of the Northern Nations&quot; (1823).

===Influence===
Fouqué&#x27;s play &quot;Der Sängerkrieg auf der Wartburg&quot; (&quot;The Song Contest on the Wartburg&quot;) is likely one of the sources for Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. Goethe was not impressed by it, remarking to Eckermann: &quot;We both agreed that all his life this poet had engaged in old Germanic studies, however without being able to develop this into a culture of his own making.&quot;

Robert Louis Stevenson admired Fouqué&#x27;s story &quot;Galgenmännlein&quot; and wrote his own version (&quot;The Bottle Imp&quot;) with a Hawaiian setting. 

John Henry Newman and Charlotte Mary Yonge both praised &quot;Sintram and his Companions&quot;. William Morris also became an admirer of &quot;Sintram and his Companions&quot;, and it influenced
Morris&#x27; own fiction. 

&quot;Sintram and his Companions&quot; and &quot;Undine&quot; are referred to in &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott; the character Jo mentions wanting them for Christmas in the first chapter of the book and finally receives them in chapter 22. &quot;Aslauga&#x27;s Knight&quot; as well as &quot;Sintram and his Companions&quot; and &quot;Undine&quot; are referred to in &quot;Jo&#x27;s Boys&quot;, the final book in Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; series, where the story of &quot;Aslauga&#x27;s Knight&quot; mirrors the character Dan and his affection for gentle Bess. &quot;Undine&quot; is the basis, along with Hans Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Little Mermaid&quot;, for Dvořák&#x27;s opera &quot;Rusalka&quot;.

<text>Estrie () is an administrative region of Quebec that comprises the Eastern Townships. &quot;Estrie&quot;, a French neologism, was coined as a derivative of &quot;est&quot;, &quot;east&quot;. Originally settled by anglophones, today it is about 90 per cent francophone. Anglophones are concentrated in Lennoxville, home of the region&#x27;s only English-speaking university, Bishop&#x27;s University. The Eastern Townships School Board runs 20 elementary schools, three high schools, and a learning centre.

The region originally consisted of 6 regional county municipalities. In 2021, La Haute-Yamaska &amp; Brome-Missisquoi joined Estrie, transferring from Montérégie.

==Economy==

While the economy of the area is mainly based on agriculture, forestry, and mining, tourist attractions include four Sépaq parks: Yamaska, Mont-Orford, Frontenac, and Mont-Mégantic, ski resorts at Mont Brome and Mont Orford, and agritourism.

<text>In chemistry, a Svedberg unit or svedberg (symbol S, sometimes Sv) is a non-SI metric unit for sedimentation coefficients. The Svedberg unit offers a measure of a particle&#x27;s size indirectly based on its sedimentation rate under acceleration (i.e. how fast a particle of given size and shape settles out of suspension). The svedberg is a measure of time, defined as exactly 10−13 seconds (100 fs).

For biological macromolecules like ribosomes, the sedimentation rate is typically measured as the rate of travel in a centrifuge tube subjected to high g-force. 

The svedberg (S) is distinct from the SI unit sievert or the non-SI unit sverdrup, which also use the symbol Sv, and to the SI unit Siemens which uses the symbol S too.

==Naming==
The unit is named after the Swedish chemist Theodor Svedberg (1884–1971), winner of the 1926 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on disperse systems, colloids and his invention of the ultracentrifuge.

==Factors==
The Svedberg coefficient is a nonlinear function. A particle&#x27;s mass, density, and shape will determine its S value. The S value depends on the frictional forces retarding its movement, which, in turn, are related to the average cross-sectional area of the particle.

The sedimentation coefficient is the ratio of the speed of a substance in a centrifuge to its acceleration in comparable units. A substance with a sedimentation coefficient of 26S () will travel at 26 micrometers per second () under the influence of an acceleration of 1 million gravities (107 m/s2). Centrifugal acceleration is given as &quot;rω&quot;; where &quot;r&quot; is the radial distance from the rotation axis and &quot;ω&quot; is the angular velocity in radians per second.

Bigger particles tend to sediment faster and so have higher Svedberg values.

Svedberg units are not directly additive since they represent a rate of sedimentation, not weight.

==Use==
In centrifugation of small biochemical species, a convention has developed in which sedimentation coefficients are expressed in the Svedberg units.

* The svedberg is the most important measure used to distinguish ribosomes. Ribosomes are composed of two complex subunits, each including rRNA and protein components. In prokaryotes (including bacteria), the subunits are named 30S and 50S for their &quot;size&quot; in Svedberg units. These subunits are made up of three forms of rRNA: 16S, 23S, and 5S and ribosomal proteins.

* For bacterial ribosomes, ultracentrifugation yields intact ribosomes (70S) as well as separated ribosomal subunits, the large subunit (50S) and the small subunit (30S). Within cells, ribosomes normally exist as a mixture of joined and separate subunits. The largest particles (whole ribosomes) sediment near the bottom of the tube, whereas the smaller particles (separated 50S and 30S subunits) appear in upper fractions.

<doc id="214925" wikidata="Q5135350" url="?curid=214925" title="Closed position">
<text>In partner dancing, closed position is a category of positions in which partners hold each other while facing at least approximately toward each other.

Closed positions employ either body contact or body support, that is, holding each other is not limited to handhold. If the partners are comfortable with each other and the dance style allows it, body contact increases the connection between the partners. Some dances, such as Balboa and Collegiate Shag are only done in body contact.

==In waltz==
The most commonly used kind of closed position comes from the waltz, and is very commonly used in ballroom dance. The leader&#x27;s right hand is on the follower&#x27;s back (or, rarely, on the left upper arm near the shoulder); its exact placement on the back ranges from the waist to the left shoulder blade. The follower&#x27;s left hand is on the leader&#x27;s right shoulder, or the upper arm near the shoulder. The other two hands are clasped together at or near chest or shoulder height.

Unlike the ballroom style, in social fast turning (or Viennese-style tempos) waltz, the follower&#x27;s left hand usually is completely around the leader&#x27;s right shoulder in a firm mutually supporting close or contact embrace. Each partner alternately but smoothly assists in the half turn with body leads while continuously right turning in line of direction in a &quot;V&quot; position. A similar close embrace position but with both hands around each other can be seen in smooth turning polka and other folk dances.

==Similar dances==
Some specific varieties of this kind of closed position are used in specific categories of ballroom dance. For instance, in the American tradition and the older European traditions, the joined hands are usually held lower than the shoulder, with the elbows low and often sharply bent. In the international standard ballroom dances the joined hands are held at or just above shoulder height, with the arms outstretched and the elbows bent at obtuse angles. In the latter style the leader&#x27;s right hand stays on the left side of the follower&#x27;s back and (except in the tango) is placed on the shoulder blade, while the follower&#x27;s left hand is placed on the leader&#x27;s right upper arm (or, in the tango, underneath the upper arm).

Many other kinds of closed positions are used in folk dance. In closed shoulder-waist position the leader holds the follower&#x27;s waist with both hands, while the follower places both hands on the leader&#x27;s shoulders. In Scandinavian folk dance (e.g. the polska, pols, and hambo) there are variations on shoulder-waist position in which the leader&#x27;s left hand is on the follower&#x27;s shoulder, upper arm, or elbow, and in the latter case the follower&#x27;s right arm is outstretched with the hand just above the leader&#x27;s sharply bent elbow.

The lavolta, one of the more famous Renaissance dances, used a distinctive kind of closed position in which the follower faced to one side from the leader and put the near hand on top of the leader&#x27;s shoulder, while the leader used both hands to hold the follower under the busk.

<doc id="214926" wikidata="Q361189" url="?curid=214926" title="Naser Orić">
<text>Naser Orić (born 3 March 1967) is a Bosnian former officer who commanded Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) forces in the Srebrenica enclave in eastern Bosnia surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces, during the Bosnian War.

In 2006, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment by the Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Netherlands for failing to prevent the deaths of five Bosnian Serb detainees and the mistreatment of eleven other detainees from late 1992 to early 1993 on the basis of superior criminal responsibility.

Orić was acquitted on other charges of wanton destruction and causing damage to civilian infrastructure beyond the realm of military necessity. On 3 July 2008, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY reversed the Trial Chamber&#x27;s conviction and acquitted Orić of all charges brought against him. In November 2018, he was formally acquitted by a Bosnian appeals court.

==Early life==
Naser Orić was born on 3 March 1967 in Donji Potočari, about from the town of Srebrenica to Džemal and Hata. His grandfather had fought with the Ustaše, a ultranationalist movement, during World War II. Orić graduated from high school with a metalworking certificate.

==Career==
Orić was conscripted into the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) in 1985/1986, where he served in a special unit for atomic and chemical defence. He left the JNA with the rank of corporal. In 1988, he completed a six-month training course in Zemun and served in Savski Venac in Belgrade as a trainee policeman. As a member of the police unit for special actions, he had courses for two more years. He was occasionally deployed to Kosovo and worked as a bodyguard for Slobodan Milošević when required. He guarded Milošević during the celebration of the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo at Gazimestan in Kosovo Polje in June 1989, when the Serbian president delivered a speech in front of hundreds of thousands of Serbs. Orić says he did not speak to Milošević when he guarded him, but says he did meet and talk with him years later when the two were both on trial at the Hague, remarking that Milošević acted &quot;like a gentleman&quot; and even gave him gifts.

In 1990, Orić was deployed to Kosovo as a member of a Special Police unit of the Ministry of the Interior of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Thereafter, he returned to Belgrade. He worked in quelling the civil unrest during the March 1991 mass anti-war protests, arresting Vuk Drašković. During that time he also worked as a bouncer at the famous Belgrade nightclub Metro (formerly Zvezda) in Knez Mihailova Street. In August 1991, Orić was transferred to a police station in Ilidža, outside Sarajevo. He was moved to the police station in Srebrenica in late 1991. In April 1992 he became the police chief of the Potočari police sub-station.

===Territorial Defence (April 1992–September 1992)===
With the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a cadre staff consisting of former JNA officers began to prepare for the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 8 April 1992, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina transformed the existing Territorial Defence of Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Territorial Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In mid-April 1992, the Potočari TO was established, and Orić became its Commander. In May 1992, members of the Crisis Staff of the TO Srebrenica appointed him as the Commander, which Sefer Halilović, Chief of the Supreme Command Staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), officially confirmed in June. Orić also became a member of the War Presidency in Srebrenica upon its creation on 1 July.

===Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina (September 1992–1995)===
In September, 1992, the Srebrenica TO HQ was renamed the HQ Srebrenica Armed Forces. Orić remained the commander. Orić&#x27;s command was further extended when he was appointed the Commander of the Joint Armed Forces of the Sub-Region Srebrenica in early November 1992. Now his command encompassed the geographical regions of several municipalities: Srebrenica, Bratunac, Vlasenica and Zvornik in Eastern Bosnia. Orić received a Certificate of Merit in April 1993.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1994, all units under the command of Orić were named the 8th Operative Group Srebrenica HQ, 2nd (Tuzla) Corps of the ABiH. On 12 July 1994, Orić was promoted to the rank of Brigadier, and sometime before the first of March he was awarded the Order of the Golden Lily, the highest award given by the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command of the ARBiH. In early 1995, the 8th Operative Group Srebrenica HQ was renamed the ABiH 2nd Corps 28th Mountain Division.

==Orić in Srebrenica 1992–1995==
===Background===
In 1990, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that ruled the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) dissolved. Ethnically defined political parties emerged in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which was one of the six republics that once constituted SFRY, and fought over BiH&#x27;s future. In November 1991, a Bosnian Serb plebiscite reflected support for BiH to remain within the SFRY. However, an overwhelming majority of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats voted for BiH independence, in the next few months.

===Beginning of the war in Srebrenica===
Srebrenica, and the surrounding Central Podrinje region, held immense strategic importance to both the Serbs and the Bosniaks during the ensuing Bosnian war.

Srebrenica was a focal point in the Serb strategy and was gradually isolated by the Serb forces in 1992. By April 1992, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) had set up artillery at all strategic points surrounding Srebrenica. In 1992, Bosniak villages around Srebrenica were under attacks by Serb forces. According to the Naser Orić trial judgement:&quot;Between April 1992 and March 1993, Srebrenica town and the villages in the area held by Bosnian Muslims were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the Bosniak forces, who offered no significant resistance. Meanwhile, in a number of villages around Srebrenica the Bosniak population began to organize local resistance groups.

From April 1992 onward, Naser Orić personally led a group of 20-30 Bosnian Muslim fighters from his native Potočari, a village about four kilometres northeast of Srebrenica. Orić was chief of the Potočari police sub-station and his group was involved in holding the front line and resisting Serb attacks on Potočari.

On April 18, 1992, Srebrenica fell to the Bosnian Serbs. However, Naser Orić and a handful of lightly-armed fighters based in Potočari ambushed and killed a number of Serb paramilitaries. On 6 May, Bosniaks led by Naser Orić carried out their first attack on a village, Gniona, to the north of the town of Srebrenica in which some Serb civilian were massacred. On May 8, 1992, a leader of the Serb forces at Srebrenica, Goran Zekić was killed in an ambush. At around the same time, the Serb forces retreated from Srebrenica and Naser Orić, together with other Bosnian Muslim fighters and civilians reoccupied Srebrenica.

The Prosecution at the ICTY alleged that between September 24, 1992 and March 20, 1993, the military police, under Orić&#x27;s command and control, subjected several Serb individuals to physical abuse, serious suffering and injury to body and health, inhumane treatment, and in some cases, murder. However, Orić was acquitted of these charges by the ICTY Appeals Chamber, who found that there is insufficient evidence to hold Orić responsible for the crimes with which he was charged.

Almost none of the Serbs, who lived in Srebrenica before the war, stayed in the town. Bosnian Serb forces committed a massacre in the village of Glogova on 9 May and in Bratunac on 10 May through 13 May. Serb forces surrounded Srebrenica and started to bomb the town.

General Philippe Morillon of France, Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), visited Srebrenica in March 1993. By then the town was overcrowded and siege conditions prevailed. There was almost no running water as the advancing Serb forces had destroyed the town’s water supplies; people relied on makeshift generators for electricity, and food, medicine and other essentials were extremely scarce. Before leaving, General Morillon told the panicked residents of Srebrenica at a public gathering that the town was under the protection of the UN and that he would never abandon them.

===The attacks===
The attacks under Orić&#x27;s command mentioned in the ICTY indictment, by Deputy Prosecutor David Tolbert, are listed below:
:*15–20 May, the villages of Viogor, Orahovica and Osredak were attacked. The main objective of these attacks was to link up various Bosniak resistance centers around Srebrenica. 
:*21-27 June, the villages of Ratkovici, Bradjevina, Ducici, and Gornji Ratkovici were attacked by Orić&#x27;s forces. The objective of the attack was reportedly to prevent further shelling of Srebrenica enclave.
:*8 August, the villages of Jezestica and Bozici were attacked by forces under the command of Naser Orić after repelling an attack of Serb paramilitary known as Panteri.
:*24 September, the village of Podravanje, which was on the road between Srebrenica and Žepa, was attacked. 19 Serbs were reportedly killed.
:*26 September, Orić&#x27;s forces attacked the villages of Nedeljista and Rogosija near Milici after repelling an attack by Serbs.
:*5 October, Orić attacked Fakovici and other villages along the river Drina. According to a Dutch government report (NIOD report), Orić&#x27;s forces killed at least 24 Serb soldiers and burned down 36 buildings. Serbs at the other (i.e. Serbian) side of the Drina were involved in skirmishes as well. The report states that Serbs were using small boats as platforms for machineguns.
:*6 November, Bosniak forces, led by Orić, attacked and captured the village of Kamenica (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
:*14-19 December, Bosnian Army and irregulars under the command of Orić attacked the villages of Bjelovac, Voljavica, Loznica, and Sikirić after an attack by the Serb Army.
:*7 January 1993 (Orthodox Christmas Day), Bosniak forces under Orić captured the Serb villages of Kravica, Siljkovici and Jezestica. An estimated 25 VRS troops and eleven civilians were killed in the attack. The attack was reportedly in response to shelling by Serb forces.
:*16 January 1993, Orić attacked the village of Skelani, on the border with Serbia, killing at least 40 Serbs.

===UN Safe Area===
On 10 January 1993 the Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladić launched a full-scale offensive against Srebrenica. On 17 April 1993, the city was made a by the United Nations, while fighting between Serb forces and Orić&#x27;s units in Srebrenica continued with the Serbs retaking much of the territory lost during 1992.

In July 1995, the partially disarmed &quot;UN safe area&quot; was ultimately overrun by the Bosnian Serb Army, resulting in the Srebrenica massacre. Orić, along with rest of the command staff of 8th OG, was evacuated by helicopter in May 1995 two months prior to the fall of the enclave.

==ICTY war crimes trial==
After the Dayton Peace Accords, Orić opened a fitness club in Tuzla. In a post-war TV interview, he stated &quot;It&#x27;s a fact that I was one of the main commanders in Srebrenica and, if I have to answer to someone, I&#x27;ll answer; but I&#x27;d first have to bring up the time, space and situation in which we lived, as well as what the Serbs did to us compared to what we did to them. If Naser has to answer to someone, I&#x27;m right here and I&#x27;m not running away from responsibility, I&#x27;m not running away from the court, I&#x27;m not running away from the Hague or anyone. You just have to call on me and no problem.&quot;

An indictment at the ICTY against Orić was submitted on 17 March 2003 and confirmed on 28 March. He was indicted on two counts of individual responsibility and four counts of command responsibility for violations of the laws or customs of war, and was arrested at his club by SFOR on 10 April 2003 and transferred to the Hague the next day. Orić appeared before the court on 15 April and pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to all the counts of the indictment. He was denied a provisional release on 25 July 2003 and was held at the ICTY from 11 April 2003 until 30 June 2006.

===The indictment===
Orić was accused of torture and cruel treatment of eleven and killing of seven Serb men being detained in the Srebrenica police station in 1992/1993, and to punish the perpetrators thereof. He was also accused of having ordered (and led) numerous guerrilla raids into as many as 50 Serb-populated villages in 1992–1993, particularly in the municipalities of Bratunac and Srebrenica. Bosnian Serb buildings, dwellings, and other property in predominantly Serb villages, were burnt and destroyed, hundreds of Serbs were murdered, and thousands of ethnic Serbs fled the area.

===The trial===
The trial began on 6 October 2004 and the prosecution completed its case on 31 May 2005. A week later the tribunal dropped two of the counts against him, withdrew all allegation of plundering public and private property; the tribunal also dropped two villages from the list of alleged raids.

The defense case commenced on 4 July 2005 and ended on 10 April 2006. The prosecution asked for an eighteen-year prison term, while the defense asked for an acquittal. In all there were 196 trial days, 83 witnesses testifying (52 called by prosecution, 30 by defense and 1 by the trial chamber) and 1,649 exhibits presented as evidence. The decision in the case was delivered on 30 June 2006.

===The verdict===
The ICTY convicted Orić for failing to prevent the murder and inhumane treatment of Serb prisoners. Orić, sentenced to two years in prison, was released immediately for time already served. He was acquitted of direct involvement in the murder or cruel treatment of Serbs, and of responsibility for the &quot;wanton destruction&quot; of homes and property.

The judges noted that militarily superior Serb forces encircled the town and that there was an unmanageable influx of refugees there, as well as a critical shortage of food and the breakdown of law and order. The judges also noted that it was in those circumstances, Orić, then 25, was elected commander of a poorly-trained volunteer force that lacked effective links with government forces in Sarajevo. His authority was scorned by some other Bosnian leaders and his situation became worse as the Serb forces increased the momentum of their siege.

The judges stated in the verdict that Orić had reason to know about murder and cruel treatment of Serbs on two specific occasions in the police station but acquitted him of all other crimes. Orić was acquitted of direct involvement in the murder of prisoners in the early years of the Bosnian War, but the court found he had closed his eyes to their mistreatment and failed to punish their killers. The three judges acquitted him of all charges related to the wanton destruction of Serb villages. The judges also took into account the lack of food and supplies and resulting lack of order and law during the Serbian siege on Srebrenica.

As for the destruction in the villages of Kravica, Bjelovac, Fakovići and Sikirić, the judgment stated that &quot;the accused and members of his group of fighters participated in the attack.&quot; In the case of the village of Šiljkovići, the court stated that &quot;there is evidence to establish that property was destroyed on a large scale.&quot;

===The appeal===
On 31 July 2006, UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte announced she would appeal against the two-year sentence, saying it was too short. Orić&#x27;s lawyer said she would also launch an appeal, saying her client did not commit any crime and should be acquitted.

==After 2006 release from imprisonment==
As Orić had already spent more than two years in detention, following his trial he was released. He arrived at Sarajevo International Airport on 1 July 2006. On 4 July, he gave an interview to the Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avaz in which he stated among other things that the atmosphere in the ICTY detention unit was jovial and that there was no hostility between the inmates who were former war time adversaries. Orić said he passed the time by working out and learning English. He added that he believed that the behavior of an indictee in the detention unit and in the courtroom would reflect the severity of the prison term one would receive.

Naser Orić was arrested on 3 October 2008 by Bosnian police. He was charged in November 2008 with extorting 240,000 Bosnian Marks ($157,000) and illegal possession of weapons and ammunition. In July 2009 he was found guilty of illegal possession of weapons and ammunition but acquitted of extortion, and sentenced to two years in prison by a Sarajevo court. The sentence was subsequently reduced to four years probation and he was pardoned by the Bosnian Federation Presidency in 2012.

===2015 imprisonment in Switzerland and extradition on new charges===
On 2 February 2014, Interpol National Central Bureau for Serbia issued an arrest warrant for Naser Orić at the request of the Serbian Justice Ministry on suspicion of war crimes against civilian populations in the villages around the Srebrenica municipality in July 1992.

Swiss border police arrested him on 10 June 2015 on the French-Swiss border based on a warrant from Serbia.
Reactions came from the Bosniak-dominated government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and organisations which support his innocence. The Bosnian government saw this as an attack by Serbia to cause tensions a month before the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide.

In 2015, the mayor of the Srebrenica municipality, Ćamil Duraković, ordered, with the agreement of local authorities, a delay of the marking of the 20th anniversary of the genocide, if Orić were transferred to Serbian authorities.

The warrant by the Serbian prosecution alleges that Orić and Bosnian Army soldier Sabahudin Muhić killed three Bosnian Serb prisoners of war in the villages of Zalazje, Lolici and Kunjerac in 1992, three years before the infamous 1995 attack on Srebrenica. He was, however, extradited to Bosnia and Herzegovina, not Serbia. In 2018 the State Court of Sarajevo acquitted him.

<text>Aileen Carol Wuornos (; born Pittman; February 29, 1956 – October 9, 2002) was an American serial killer. In 1989–1990, while engaging in street prostitution along highways in Florida, she shot dead and robbed seven of her male clients. Wuornos claimed that her clients had either raped or attempted to rape her, and that the homicides of the men were committed in self-defense. Wuornos was sentenced to death for six of the murders. She was executed on October 9, 2002, by lethal injection after spending more than 10 years on Florida&#x27;s death row. 

In the feature film &quot;Monster&quot; (2003), Wuornos&#x27; story is described from her first murder until her execution; for her portrayal of Wuornos, Charlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Wuornos was born Aileen Carol Pittman on February 29, 1956, in Rochester, Michigan. Her mother, Diane Wuornos (born 1939), was 14 years old when she married Aileen&#x27;s father, 18-year-old Leo Pittman (1936–1969), on June 3, 1954. On March 14, 1955, Diane gave birth to Aileen&#x27;s older brother Keith. After less than two years of marriage, and two months before Aileen was born, Diane filed for divorce. She gave birth to Aileen at the age of 16.

Wuornos never met her father. In 1967, Leo Pittman was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and raping a seven-year-old girl. Pittman was diagnosed with schizophrenia; he committed suicide by hanging in prison on January 30, 1969. In January 1960, when Wuornos was almost four years old, Diane abandoned her children, leaving them with their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos, both alcoholics, who legally adopted Keith and Aileen on March 18, 1960. Lauri and Britta were Finnish Americans who were born in Ii, Finland, and later moved to Michigan.

By the age of 11, Wuornos began engaging in sexual activities in school in exchange for cigarettes, drugs, and food. She had also engaged in sexual activities with her brother. Wuornos said that her alcoholic grandfather had sexually assaulted and beaten her when she was a child. Before beating her, he would force her to strip out of her clothes. In 1970, at age 14, she became pregnant after being raped by a family friend.

Wuornos gave birth to a boy at a home for unwed mothers on March 23, 1971, and the child was placed for adoption. A few months after her son was born, she dropped out of school at about the same time that her grandmother died of liver failure. When Wuornos was 15, her grandfather threw her out of the house, and she began living in the woods near her old home and supported herself through prostitution.

==Early criminal activity==
On May 27, 1974, at age 18, Wuornos was arrested in Jefferson County, Colorado, for driving under the influence (DUI), disorderly conduct, and firing a .22-caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. She was later charged with failure to appear.

In 1976, Wuornos hitchhiked to Florida, where she met 69-year-old yacht club president Lewis Gratz Fell. They married quickly, and the announcement of their nuptials was printed in the local newspaper&#x27;s society pages. Wuornos continually involved herself in confrontations at their local bar and went to jail briefly for assault. She also hit Fell with his own cane, leading him to gain a restraining order against her within weeks of the marriage. She returned to Michigan where, on July 14, 1976, she was arrested at Bernie&#x27;s Club in Mancelona, Antrim County and charged with assault and disturbing the peace for throwing a cue ball at a bartender&#x27;s head.

On July 17, her brother Keith died of esophageal cancer and Wuornos received $10,000 from his life insurance. Wuornos and Fell annulled their marriage on July 21 after only nine weeks. In August 1976, Wuornos was given a $105 fine for drunk driving. She used the money inherited from her brother to pay the fine and spent the rest within two months buying luxuries including a new car, which she wrecked shortly afterwards.

In 1978, at the age of 22, she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the stomach. Between the ages of 14 and 22, she attempted suicide six times. On May 20, 1981, Wuornos was arrested in Edgewater, Florida, for the armed robbery of a convenience store, where she stole $35 and two packs of cigarettes. She was sentenced to prison on May 4, 1982, and released on June 30, 1983. On May 1, 1984, Wuornos was arrested for attempting to pass forged checks at a bank in Key West. On November 30, 1985, she was named as a suspect in the theft of a revolver and ammunition in Pasco County.

On January 4, 1986, Wuornos was arrested in Miami and charged with car theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction of justice for providing identification bearing her aunt&#x27;s name. Miami police officers found a .38 caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986, Volusia County deputy sheriffs detained Wuornos for questioning after a male companion accused her of pulling a gun in his car and demanding $200. Wuornos was found to be carrying spare ammunition, and police discovered a .22 pistol under the passenger seat she had occupied.

In 1986, 30-year-old Wuornos met 24-year-old Tyria Moore, a motel maid, at a Daytona Beach gay bar called Zodiac. They moved in together, and Wuornos supported them with her earnings as a prostitute. On July 4, 1987, Daytona Beach police detained Wuornos and Moore at a bar for questioning regarding an incident in which they were accused of assault and battery with a beer bottle.

On March 12, 1988, Wuornos accused a Daytona Beach bus driver of assault. She claimed that he pushed her off the bus following a confrontation. Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. Later, at her trial, Wuornos stated: &quot;It was love beyond imaginable. Earthly words cannot describe how I felt about Tyria.&quot; Before her execution, Wuornos claimed to still be in love with Moore.

==Series of murders==
Wuornos murdered seven men within 12 months. All the men were motorists between the ages of 40 and 65. 

* Richard Charles Mallory, age 51, electronics store owner in Clearwater (date of murder: November 30, 1989). Wuornos claimed that Mallory beat, raped, and sodomized her after he drove her to an abandoned area for sexual services. Mallory was Wuornos&#x27; first victim and she claimed to have killed him in self-defense. Later, it became known that Mallory had previously been convicted of attempted rape in Maryland. Aileen made no mention of this until she stood trial and Tyria never claimed she mentioned it to her. Two days after the murder, a Volusia County deputy sheriff found Mallory&#x27;s abandoned vehicle. On December 13, his body was found several miles away in a wooded area; he had been shot several times, and two bullets to the left lung were found to have been the cause of death.
* David Andrew Spears, age 47, construction worker in Winter Garden. He was declared missing as of May 19, 1990. On June 1, 1990, his naked body was found along US 19 in Citrus County. He had been shot six times with a .22 pistol.
* Charles Edmund Carskaddon, age 40, part-time rodeo worker (date of murder: May 31, 1990). On June 6, 1990, his naked body was found in Pasco County. He had been shot nine times with a .22 caliber weapon. The body had been wrapped in an electric blanket and was badly decomposing when found. Witnesses saw Wuornos in possession of Carskaddon&#x27;s car, and Wuornos had also pawned a gun identified as belonging to Carskaddon.
* Peter Abraham Siems, age 65, retired merchant seaman. In June 1990, Siems left Jupiter, Florida, for Arkansas. On July 4, 1990, his car was found in Orange Springs, Florida. Moore and Wuornos were seen abandoning the car, and Wuornos&#x27; handprint was found on the interior door handle. His body was never found.
* Troy Eugene Burress, age 50, sausage salesman from Ocala, Florida. On July 31, 1990, he was reported missing. On August 4, 1990, his body was found in a wooded area along State Road 19 in Marion County. He had been shot twice.
* Charles Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Humphreys, age 56, retired United States Air Force major, former state child abuse investigator, and former Chief of Police (date of murder: September 11, 1990). On September 12, 1990, his body was found in Marion County. He was fully clothed and had been shot seven times in the head and torso. His car was found in Suwannee County.
* Walter Gino Antonio, age 61, trucker, security guard, and reserve police officer. On November 19, 1990, Antonio&#x27;s nearly naked body was found near a remote logging road in Dixie County. He had been shot four times. Five days later, his car was found in Brevard County.

==Arrest and trial==
On July 4, 1990, Wuornos and Tyria Moore abandoned victim Peter Siems&#x27; car after they were involved in an accident. Rhonda Bailey, who witnessed the accident, provided police with a description of two women, which later led to a media campaign to locate them. Police also found some of the victims&#x27; belongings in pawnshops. Wuornos&#x27; fingerprint that was found on a receipt at one of the pawnshops matched the print that was left in Siems&#x27; car. Wuornos had a criminal record in Florida, and samples of her prints were in a database.

On January 9, 1991, Wuornos was arrested at The Last Resort biker bar in Volusia County on the pretext of an outstanding warrant in the name of Lori Grody. Police located Moore the next day in Pittston, Pennsylvania. She agreed to elicit a confession from Wuornos in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Moore returned with the police to Florida, where she was put up in a motel. Under police guidance, she made numerous telephone calls to Wuornos, pleading for help in clearing her name. Three days later, on January 16, 1991, Wuornos confessed to the murders. She claimed the men had tried to rape her and she killed them in self-defense. In November 1991, Wuornos was legally adopted by 44-year-old Arlene Pralle, with whom Wuornos had no previous contact or relation, after Pralle saw Wuornos’s photo in a newspaper.

On January 14, 1992, Wuornos went to trial for the murder of Richard Charles Mallory. Although previous convictions are normally inadmissible in criminal trials, under Florida&#x27;s Williams Rule, the prosecution was allowed to introduce evidence related to her other crimes to show a pattern of illegal activity. On January 27, 1992, Wuornos was convicted of Mallory&#x27;s murder with help from Moore&#x27;s testimony. At her sentencing, psychiatrists for the defense testified that Wuornos was mentally unstable and diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Four days later, she was sentenced to death.

Wuornos&#x27; defense made efforts during the trial to introduce evidence that Mallory was previously convicted for attempted rape in Maryland and served a sentence in a maximum security correctional facility providing remediation to sexual offenders. Records obtained from the correctional institution showed that from 1958 to 1962, Mallory was committed for treatment and observation resulting from a criminal charge of assault with intent to rape. These records also reflect eight years of overall treatment from the facility. In 1961, &quot;it was observed of Mr. Mallory that he possessed strong sociopathic trends&quot;. However, the judge refused to allow the records to be admitted in court as evidence, and denied Wuornos&#x27; request for a retrial.

On March 31, 1992, Wuornos pleaded no contest to the murders of Charles Richard Humphreys, Troy Eugene Burress, and David Andrew Spears, saying she wanted to &quot;get right with God&quot;. In her statement to the court, she said, in part, &quot;I wanted to confess to you that Richard Mallory did violently rape me as I&#x27;ve told you; but these others did not. [They] only began to start to.&quot; On May 15, 1992, Wuornos was given three more death sentences. In June 1992, Wuornos pleaded guilty to the murder of Charles Edmund Carskaddon. In November 1992, she received her fifth death sentence. In February 1993, Wuornos pleaded guilty to the murder of Walter Jeno Antonio and was sentenced to death again. No charges were brought against her for the murder of Peter Abraham Siems, as his body was never found. In all, Wuornos received six death sentences.

Wuornos told several inconsistent stories about the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had either raped or attempted to rape her while she was working as a prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with documentarian Nick Broomfield, when Wuornos thought the cameras were off, she told him that it was, in fact, self-defense, but she could not stand being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.

==Death row and execution==
===Being on death row===
Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) death row for women, then transferred to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. &quot;I killed those men&quot;, she wrote, &quot;robbed them as cold as ice. And I&#x27;d do it again, too. There&#x27;s no chance in keeping me alive or anything, because I&#x27;d kill again. I have hate crawling through my system ... I am so sick of hearing this &#x27;she&#x27;s crazy&#x27; stuff. I&#x27;ve been evaluated so many times. I&#x27;m competent, sane, and I&#x27;m trying to tell the truth. I&#x27;m one who seriously hates human life and would kill again.&quot; While her attorneys argued that she was not mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that she knew what she was doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.

In 2002, Wuornos began accusing prison matrons of tainting her food with dirt, saliva, and urine. She said she had overheard conversations among prison personnel &quot;trying to get me so pushed over the brink by them I&#x27;d wind up committing suicide before the execution&quot; and &quot;wishing to rape me before execution&quot;. She also complained of strip searches, tight handcuffing, door kicking, frequent window checks, low water pressure, mildew on her mattress, and &quot;cat calling ... in distaste and a pure hatred towards me&quot;. Wuornos threatened to boycott showers and food trays when certain officers were on duty. &quot;In the meantime, my stomach&#x27;s growling away and I&#x27;m taking showers through the sink of my cell.&quot; Her attorney stated that &quot;Ms. Wuornos really just wants to have proper treatment, humane treatment until the day she&#x27;s executed.&quot; He added, &quot;She believes what she&#x27;s written&quot;.

In the weeks before her execution, Wuornos gave a series of interviews to documentarian Nick Broomfield and talked about &quot;being taken away to meet God and Jesus and the angels and whatever is beyond the beyond&quot;. In her final interview, she once again charged that her mind was &quot;tortured&quot; at BCI, and her head crushed by &quot;sonic pressure&quot;. Food poisonings and other abuses worsened, she said, each time she complained, to make her appear insane, or to drive her insane. She also turned on her interviewer: &quot;You sabotaged my ass! Society, and the cops, and the system! A raped woman got executed, and was used for books and movies and shit!&quot; Her final on-camera words were &quot;Thanks a lot, society, for railroading my ass&quot;. Dawn Botkins, a childhood friend of Wuornos, later told Broomfield that her verbal abuse was directed at society and the media in general, not at him specifically.

===Execution and death===
Wuornos&#x27; execution by lethal injection took place on October 9, 2002. She declined her last meal which could have been anything under $20 and opted for a cup of coffee instead. Her last words were, &quot;Yes, I would just like to say I&#x27;m sailing with the rock, and I&#x27;ll be back, like &quot;Independence Day&quot;, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I&#x27;ll be back, I&#x27;ll be back&quot;. She died at 9:47 a.m. EDT. She was the second woman in Florida and the tenth in the United States to be executed since the 1976 United States Supreme Court decision restoring capital punishment.

After her death, Wuornos&#x27; body was cremated. Wuornos&#x27; ashes were scattered beneath a tree in her native Michigan by Wuornos&#x27; childhood friend Dawn Botkins. At Wuornos&#x27; request, Natalie Merchant&#x27;s song &quot;Carnival&quot; from her album &quot;Tigerlily&quot; (1995) was played at her funeral: Wuornos spent many hours listening to this album on death row. When Merchant found out about this, she gave permission to use the song in the closing credits of Nick Broomfield&#x27;s documentary &quot;&quot; (2003):

Broomfield later speculated on Wuornos&#x27; state of mind and motives:

==Psychopathology model==
According to some specialists, Wuornos&#x27; crimes have been related to her psychopathic personality and her psychotraumatic past. Assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist, Wuornos scored 32/40 with the cutoff score of 30 for determining psychopathy. Wuornos was also known to meet the relevant criteria for determining borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.

According to Brice Arrigo, Wuornos&#x27; childhood sexual abuse and career in sex work irrevocably damaged her, and it could be seen that traumatic experiences throughout most of her young life could play a part in Wuornos&#x27; psychological state, including her biological mother&#x27;s departure as well as her grandmother ignoring the abuse she endured from her grandfather, thus leading to the lack of development of a &quot;mother–daughter&quot; bond for Wuornos as a young girl. The damage was then made worse because both Wuornos and her brother believed that their grandparents were their biological parents, but at the age of 11 they learned that this was not the case, which further damaged the relationship between Wuornos and her adoptive parents.

Wuornos was also known to have early behavioral problems such as having an explosive temper which limited her ability to make friends, as well as making it increasingly difficult for her to maintain relationships. Her traumatic upbringing, including her physical and sexual abuse, have been partially linked to the development of her borderline personality disorder. Such severe trauma can also disrupt the structuralization of the mind at various developmental points and result in &quot;primitive, dissociative, and splitting defenses to ward off the intensity of emotional and sexual stimulation that cannot be integrated as a child.&quot;

FBI profiler Robert Ressler briefly mentions Wuornos in his autobiographical history of his 20 years with the FBI. Writing in 1992, he said he often does not discuss female serial killers because they tend to kill in sprees instead of in a sequential fashion. He noted Wuornos as the sole exception. Ressler, who allegedly coined the term &quot;serial killer&quot; to describe murderers seeking personal gratification, does not apply it to women killing in postpartum psychosis or to any murderer acting solely for financial gain, such as women who have killed a series of boarders or spouses.

In 2024, the &quot;Cross&quot; season 1 from episode 2 to episode 8 with Wuornos lookalike portrayed by Eloise Mumford is loosely based on the Execution and death of Aileen Wuornos, although the show contains its usual disclaimer that the story and characters are fictional.

===Music===
An operatic adaptation of Wuornos&#x27; life premiered at San Francisco&#x27;s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on June 22, 2001. Entitled &quot;Wuornos&quot;, the opera was written by composer and librettist Carla Lucero, conducted by Mary Chun, and produced by the Jon Sims Center for the Performing Arts.

Several musicians have written songs about Wuornos, including Jewel (&quot;Nicotine Love&quot;), the New York-based metalcore band It Dies Today (&quot;Sixth of June&quot;), and Pablo Hasél (&quot;Inéditas por culpa de Aileen Wuornos&quot;).

The singer Diamanda Galás recorded a live cover of the Phil Ochs song &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, which she would often perform as a tribute to Wuornos, for her performance album &quot;Malediction and Prayer&quot; (1998).

Japanese doom metal band Church of Misery released the song &quot;Filth Bitch Boogie (Aileen Wuornos)&quot; on their 2004 studio album &quot;The Second Coming&quot;.

Lingua Ignota&#x27;s song &quot;If the Poison Won&#x27;t Take You My Dogs Will&quot; of her 2019 album &quot;Caligula&quot; is also about Wuornos.

The song &quot;Poor Aileen&quot; by Superheaven, which is the final track from the 2015 album &quot;Ours Is Chrome&quot;, is written about Aileen Wuornos.

A parody cover version of Dolly Parton&#x27;s song &quot;Jolene&quot; called &quot;Aileen&quot;, dedicated by Wuornos, is featured on Willam Belli&#x27;s third album. The music video, featuring Gigi Gorgeous portraying Wuornos, was released on November 1, 2018.

In 2019, rapper Cardi B recreated Wuornos&#x27; famous mugshot for her single &quot;Press&quot;. In 2020, rapper Sadistik released the song &quot;Aileen Wuornos&quot;, dedicated to the serial killer, on his &quot;Delirium&quot; EP.

<text>The Isle of Ely () is a historic region around the city of Ely in Cambridgeshire, England. Between 1889 and 1965, it formed an administrative county.

==Etymology==

Its name has been said to mean &quot;island of eels&quot;, a reference to the fish that were often caught in the local rivers for food. This etymology was first recorded by the Venerable Bede.

==History==

Until the 17th century, the area was an island surrounded by a large area of fenland, a type of swamp. It was coveted as an area easy to defend, and was controlled in the very early medieval period by the Gyrwas, an Anglo-Saxon tribe. Upon their marriage in 652, Tondbert, a prince of the Gyrwas, presented Æthelthryth (who became St. Æthelthryth), the daughter of King Anna of the East Angles, with the Isle of Ely. She afterwards founded a monastery at Ely, which was destroyed by Viking raiders in 870, but was rebuilt and became a famous Abbey and Shrine.

The area&#x27;s natural defences led to it playing a role in the military history of England. Following the Norman Conquest, the Isle became a refuge for Anglo-Saxon forces under Earl Morcar, Bishop Aethelwine of Durham and Hereward the Wake in 1071. The area was taken by William the Conqueror only after a prolonged struggle.
The story of Tom Hickathrift is sometimes set around this period.
In 1139 civil war broke out between the forces of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda. Bishop Nigel of Ely, a supporter of Matilda, unsuccessfully tried to hold the Isle. In 1143 Geoffrey de Mandeville rebelled against Stephen, and made his base in the Isle. Geoffrey was mortally wounded at Burwell in 1144.
In 1216, during the First Barons&#x27; War, the Isle was unsuccessfully defended against the army of King John.
Ely took part in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381.
During the English Civil War the Isle of Ely was held for the parliamentarians. Troops from the garrison at Wisbech Castle were used in the siege of Crowland and parts of the Fens were flooded to prevent Royalist forces entering Norfolk from Lincolnshire. The Horseshoe sluice on the river at Wisbech and the nearby castle and town defences were upgraded and cannon brought from Ely.

The Fens were drained beginning in 1626 using a network of canals designed by Dutch experts. Many Fenlanders were opposed to the draining as it deprived some of them of their traditional livelihood. Acts of vandalism on dykes, ditches, and sluices were common, but the draining was complete by the end of the century.

==Administration==

From 1109 until 1837, the Isle was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ely who appointed a Chief Justice of Ely and exercised temporal powers within the Liberty of Ely. This temporal jurisdiction originated in a charter granted by King Edgar in 970, and confirmed by Edward the Confessor and Henry I to the abbot of Ely. The latter monarch established Ely as the seat of a bishop in 1109, creating the Isle of Ely a county palatine under the bishop. An act of parliament in 1535/6 ended the palatine status of the Isle, with all justices of the peace to be appointed by letters patent issued under the great seal and warrants to be issued in the king&#x27;s name. However, the bishop retained exclusive jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, and was custos rotulorum. A chief bailiff was appointed for life by the bishop, and performed the functions of high sheriff within the liberty, who also headed the government of the city of Ely.

In July 1643 Oliver Cromwell was made governor of the isle.
The (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. 53) ended the bishop&#x27;s secular powers in the Isle. The area was declared a division of Cambridgeshire, with the right to appoint justices revested in the crown. Following the 1837 act the Isle maintained separate Quarter Sessions, and formed its own constabulary.

Under the &quot;Local Government Bill&quot; of 1888, which proposed the introduction of elected county councils, the Isle was to form part of Cambridgeshire. Following the intervention of the local member of parliament, Charles Selwyn, the Isle of Ely was constituted a separate administrative county in 1889. The county was small in terms of both area and population, and its abolition was proposed by the Local Government Boundary Commission in 1947. The report of the LGBC was not acted upon, and the administrative county survived until 1965. Following the recommendations of the Local Government Commission for England, on 1 April 1965 the bulk of the area was merged to form Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely, with the Thorney Rural District going to Huntingdon and Peterborough.

===Subdivisions===
In 1894 the county was divided into county districts, with the rural districts being Ely Rural District, Thorney Rural District, Whittlesey Rural District, Wisbech Rural District, North Witchford Rural District, and the urban districts were Ely, March, Whittlesey and Wisbech (the only municipal borough). Whittlesey Rural district consisted of only one parish (Whittlesey Rural), which was added to Whittlesey urban district, in 1926.

The Isle of Ely parliamentary constituency was created as a two-member seat in the First and Second Protectorate Parliaments from 1654 to 1659. The constituency was re-created with a single seat in 1918. In the boundary changes of 1983 it was replaced by the new constituency of North East Cambridgeshire. Original historical documents relating to the Isle of Ely are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office in Ely.

=== Medieval parishes ===
Chapelries are listed in italics. Parishes are listed by hundred.
== Marquessate ==
The title Marquess of the Isle of Ely was created in the Peerage of Great Britain for Prince Frederick. The title of Duke of Edinburgh was first created on 26 July 1726 by King George I, who bestowed it on his grandson Prince Frederick, who became Prince of Wales the following year. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom were Baron of Snowdon, in the County of Caernarvon; Viscount of Launceston, in the County of Cornwall; Earl of Eltham, in the County of Kent; and Marquess of the Isle of Ely. The marquessate was apparently erroneously gazetted as Marquess of the Isle of Wight although Marquess of the Isle of Ely was the intended title. In later editions of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; the Duke is referred to as the Marquess of the Isle of Ely. Upon Frederick&#x27;s death, the titles were inherited by his son Prince George. When he became George III in 1760, the titles &quot;merged into the Crown&quot;, and ceased to exist.

<text>Microcosmodontidae is a poorly preserved family of fossil mammals within the extinct order Multituberculata. Representatives are known from the Lower Paleocene of North America. The family is part of the suborder Cimolodonta. Other than that, their systematic relationships are hard to define.

These microcosmodontids were rather small and had a &quot;large lower incisor with a restricted enamel band, (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum 2001, p.417). This grouping has also be seen as Microcosmodontinae Holtzman &amp; Wolberg, 1977, within Eucosmodontidae. However, &quot;Microcosmodontidae (new rank assigned by Fox to the subfamily Microcosmodontinae),&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001).

<text>Otto Pollak (30 April 1908 – 18 April 1998) was a writer and a professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.

His most controversial and famous book was &quot;The Criminality of Women&quot; (1950), in which he suggested that women commit just as much crime as men, but that their crime is more easily hidden. Pollak further argued that the criminal justice system was biased by preconceptions about women and did not convict or sentence women as harshly as men. His empirical work has provided a starting point for criminology on women. His work has also been used in political debates, as some antifeminist or masculist groups have appropriated his work.

<doc id="214934" wikidata="Q19794820" url="?curid=214934" title="Stonemasonry">
<text>Stonemasonry or stonecraft is the creation of buildings, structures, and sculpture using stone as the primary material. Stonemasonry is the craft of shaping and arranging stones, often together with mortar and even the ancient lime mortar, to wall or cover formed structures.

The basic tools, methods and skills of the banker mason have existed as a trade for thousands of years. It is one of the oldest activities and professions in human history. Many of the long-lasting, ancient shelters, temples, monuments, artifacts, fortifications, roads, bridges, and entire cities were built of stone. Famous works of stonemasonry include Göbekli Tepe, the Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal, Cusco&#x27;s Incan Wall, Taqwesan, Easter Island&#x27;s statues, Angkor Wat, Borobudur, Tihuanaco, Tenochtitlan, Persepolis, the Parthenon, Stonehenge, the Great Wall of China, the Mesoamerican pyramids, Chartres Cathedral, and the Stari Most.

While stone was important traditionally, it fell out of use in the modern era, in favor of brick and steel-reinforced concrete. This is despite the advantages of stone over concrete. Those advantages include:

* Many types of stone are stronger than concrete in compression.
* Stone uses much less energy to produce, and hence its production emits less carbon dioxide than either brick or concrete.
* Stone is widely considered aesthetically pleasing, while concrete is often painted or clad.

Modern stonemasonry is in the process of reinventing itself for automation, modern load-bearing stone construction, innovative reinforcement techniques, and integration with other sustainable materials, like engineered wood.

== Stonemasonry disciplines ==

* A quarryman splits or cuts rock in the quarry, and extracts the resulting blocks of stone. The cut or split pieces are collected and transported away from the extraction surface for further refinement.
* A sawyer stonemason cuts these stone blocks into dimension stone, to required size with saws. The resulting block, if ordered for a specific component, is known as sawn six sides (SSS). A sawyer mason is similar to a banker mason (see below) in that they work with rough pieces of stone and shape them according to certain standards. The main difference between a sawyer mason and a banker mason is the size of the stone they work with. A sawyer mason typically works with much larger pieces and uses diamond-coated tools. Sawyer masons may work in quarries or be found in tile or flooring stores, possessing a range of specific skills, such as examining grain patterns to determine cleavage, creating smaller stones from larger pieces, and carving precise outlines and drilling holes using various tools like chisels.
* A banker mason, sometimes referred to as a bank mason, is workshop-based, and specializes in working the stones into the shapes required by a building&#x27;s design, this set out on templets and a bed mould. A banker mason uses various hand and power tools to cut, carve, and shape stone. They can produce anything from stones with simple chamfers to tracery windows, detailed mouldings and the more classical architectural building masonry. When working a stone from a sawn block, the mason ensures that the stone is bedded in the right way, so the finished work sits in the building in the same orientation as it was formed on the ground. Occasionally though some stones need to be oriented correctly for the application; this includes voussoirs, jambs, copings, and cornices. The stone&#x27;s size and shape are usually predetermined by builders or other parties involved in a project, and the banker mason works according to a brief or a set of designs provided for that project. Once the stone has been crafted to the required specifications, it is transported to the construction site or another location for use in a building or other structure.
* A fixer mason specializes in the fixing of stones onto buildings, using lifting tackle, and traditional lime mortars and grouts. Sometimes modern cements, mastics, and epoxy resins are used, usually on specialist applications such as stone cladding. Metal fixings, from simple dowels and cramps to specialized single application fixings, are also used. The precise tolerances necessarily make this a highly skilled job. A fixer mason is responsible for traveling to a job site to fit and lay pre-prepared stone or cladding for buildings. They might do this with grouts, mortars, and lifting tackle. They might also use things like single application specialized fixings, simple cramps, and dowels as well as stone cladding with things like epoxy resins, mastics, and modern cements.
* A memorial mason or monumental mason carves gravestones and inscriptions.
* A carver mason crosses the line from craft to art. They use their artistic ability to carve stone into foliage, figures, animals or abstract designs. Carver masons are the artists of stonemasonry, responsible for creating designs and/or patterns from stone, as well as on stones. This work can include stone sculptures of figures or animals, or other projects of a similar nature. Throughout history, carver masons have been renowned for their exceptional skills in crafting beautiful pieces from stone.

== Classical stonemasonry techniques ==
Stone has been used in construction for thousands of years, in many contexts. Listed below are six types of classical stonemasonry techniques, some of which still see widespread use.

* Ashlar masonry. Stone masonry using dressed (cut) stones is known as ashlar masonry.
* Trabeated systems. One of the oldest forms of stone construction uses a lintel (beam) laid across stone posts or columns. This method predates Stonehenge, and refined versions were used by the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans.
* Arch masonry. Also called &quot;arcuated systems&quot; in contrast with trabeated systems, which are two ancient methods for creating a void below a stone span (either a lintel or an arch). Note that the Wikipedia page on stone arches is about stone-arch bridges exclusively, and the arch page is about all arches, including non-stone.
* Rubble masonry. Use of rubble in masonry: antonymous to ashlar masonry. Can be infill in an ashlar wall, used in cyclopean concrete, and other contexts. The term is antonymous to &quot;ashlar&quot;.
* Dry stone. Stone walls built without mortar, using the shape of the stones, compression, and friction for stability. This technique encompasses cyclopean masonry and other mortar-less methods, but is conventionally used to describe agricultural walls used to mark boundaries, contain livestock, and retain soil.
* Cyclopean masonry. Drywall construction using massive boulders that may have been shaped to fit together. Polygonal masonry is a subtype of cyclopean masonry where the boulders are shaped into polygonal profiles.

== Modern stonemasonry systems ==


In the modern era, stone has been largely relegated to being a cosmetic element of buildings, often used as decorative cladding on steel-reinforced concrete. This is despite its wide historical use in large compressive structures: 50-m bridges and colosseums in Roman times, ~65-m tall cathedrals since the middle ages, and 12-story apartment buildings built in the 1690s.

=== Modern stonemasonry techniques ===
* Stone veneer is used as a protective and decorative covering for interior or exterior walls and surfaces. The veneer is typically 1 in (25.4 mm) thick and must weigh less than 15 lb per square foot (73 kg m−2) so that no additional structural supports are required. The structural wall is put up first, and thin, flat stones are mortared onto the face of the wall. Metal tabs in the structural wall are mortared between the stones to tie everything together, to prevent the stonework from separating from the wall.
* Massive precut stone. Also known as &quot;prefabricated stone&quot;, &quot;massive stone&quot;, &quot;pre-sized stone&quot;, or &quot;pré-taille&quot; stone.
* Post-tensioned stone. A high-performance composite construction material consisting of stone held in compression with tension elements. The tension elements can be connected to the outside of the stone, but more typically uses tendons threaded internally through a duct formed from aligned drilled holes.
* Pre-tensioned stone. Using an epoxy shear connector, early experiments have shown that it is possible to pre-tension stone, maintaining the tendon under tension while the liquid epoxy is injected and allowed to set.
* Digital stereotomy. Using CAD and computer models of load, modern designers are able to cut complex vaults, arches, and other arrangements of precisely cut ashlars. Antecedents to this discipline include curved vaults, and also flat vaults that use a concentric flat arch vault and the Abeille flat vault. Using digital design and machining, such compression structures can be shapes into complex compressive structures. Leaders in this area include Giuseppe Fallacara and Philippe Block.
* Trabeated stone exoskeleton. In the modern era, post-and-lintel construction was adapted use as a stone exoskeleton in the design of 15 Clerkenwell Close. The stone exoskeleton method is a variant of the massive precut stone method: the ends of the posts and lintels are precisely precut offsite prior to assembly by crane. At least two more trabeated stone exoskeleton high-rise buildings are underway, one in London, and another in Bristol.
* Stone bricks. Small stone ashlars that are cut by the quarry to brick sizing to allow their use in standardized brick-laying workflows. Cost is similar to clay composite bricks, but with greatly reduced carbon emissions. As stone does not change size like fired clay bricks, brick-sized stone ashlars do not require expansion joints.
* Cyclopean concrete. This method uses a combination of cyclopean masonry and rubble masonry: boulders and or rubble are placed in a form (or in a ditch), and concrete is poured on top to bind the stones together before removing the form. Variations of this include Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s &#x27;desert masonry&#x27; and Institut Balear de l&#x27;Habitatge&#x27;s cyclopean concrete blocks, which are cast in a large slab and precisely sawn for use as prefabricated masonry in the massive precut stone system.
* Slipform stonemasonry is a variation of Cyclopean concrete stone-wall construction that uses formwork to contain the rocks and mortar while keeping the walls straight. Short forms, up to two feet tall, are placed on both sides of the wall to serve as a guide for the stonework. Stones are placed inside the forms with the good faces against the formwork. Concrete is poured behind the rocks. Rebar is added for strength, to make a wall that is approximately half reinforced concrete and half stonework. The wall can be faced with stone on one side or both sides.
* Formwork stone. &quot;Pierre banchée&quot; in French. Uses stone tiles or ashlars as shuttering for pouring concrete. These are left in place after the concrete sets. This is the inverse procedure to stone cladding, where the stone tiles are attached to the concrete after the temporary shuttering has been removed. Developed by Fernand Pouillon to accelerate construction. Formwork stone is distinct from cyclopean concrete in that the former uses rectilinear tiles, while the latter uses boulders and/or cobblestone.

Massive precut stone is also known as &quot;prefabricated&quot;, or &quot;pre-sized&quot; stone is a modern method of building with load-bearing stone. Precut stone is a DFMA construction method that uses large machine-cut stone blocks with precisely defined dimensions to rapidly assemble buildings in which stone is used as a major or the primary load-bearing material.

Massive precut stone construction was originally developed by Fernand Pouillon in the postwar period. He referred to the method as &quot;pierre de taille&quot; or &quot;pré-taille&quot; stone. It became possible through innovations by Pouillon and Paul Marcerou, a masonry engineer at a quarry in Fontvieille, to adapt high-precision saws from the timber industry to quarrying and stone sawing.

The key technique of massive precut (MP) stone is to cut stone ashlars to precise dimensions that match the architect&#x27;s plan such that the stones can be dropped into place by crane for rapid construction. The blocks may be numbered so that the masons can follow the plan procedurally. The use of massive blocks reduces costs by minimizing sawing and fixer-masonry costs. The use of a crane reduces labor, accelerates construction, and allows the masons to precisely and quickly position the blocks.

==== Design features of massive precut stone ====
MP stone is defined by four design attributes.

* Load-bearing stone. This distinguishes it from cosmetic precut stone, which is used for cladding decoration. Historically, load-bearing stone is the most durable construction method.
* Massive block sizes. The heuristic definition of &#x27;massive stone&#x27; is a block that is too heavy to be lifted by hand. Using massive dimensions has three critical benefits: (1) minimizing cuts, which lowers cost and shortens production time, (2) increasing the thermal mass of walls for temperature regulation in the building, and (3) making use of crane construction, thereby lowering manual labor, shortening assembly time, reducing mortar, labor, and cost.
* Precise offsite dimension cuts. Precutting can be done at the quarry, or at a masonry workshop by sawyer and banker masons. The precision amounts to a form of prefabrication, such that the masons do not have to make adjustments onsite, and construction is an assembly process. Precise ashlar interfaces also reduce the amount of mortar required.

==== Types of massive precut stone construction ====
* Massive precut ashlars. Blocks cut precisely on four to six sides, used to assemble walls, lintels over windows and doors, and in flat arches.
* End-shaped massive precut posts and lintels. Quarry-finished blocks with precisely shaped ends for assembly into post-and-lintel frameworks.
* Massive cyclopean concrete blocks. Developed by IBAVI in Mallorca, rough stones are placed in a mold and saturated with concrete. The concrete is sawn into massive ashlars for crane assembly. Enables reuse of rough plum stones from traditional stone masonry.

==== Benefits of massive precut stone construction ====
MP stone construction has advantages over conventional masonry and concrete construction.

* Build speed. The use of precisely cut and numbered ashlars, combined with crane-assisted assembly, significantly reduces construction time compared to traditional stone-masonry techniques. Compared to concrete construction, MP stone is faster as there is no setting wait time.
* Cost reduction. Compared to brick masonry or smaller ashlars, using larger stone blocks and thereby minimizing sawing and fixer-masonry costs, the overall expense of constructing a building can be reduced.
* Labor efficiency. The use of cranes and a well-organized construction plan reduces the labor required, lowering costs and reducing the wait time for skilled mason availability.
* Design efficiency. The precision of machine-cut ashlars allows for more modularity in design, enabling architects to create building designs quickly.
* Durability. Buildings constructed using massive precut stone maintain the inherent durability and longevity of stone construction, offering long-lasting and low-maintenance structures. At least one study of a modern 20-storey unreinforced MP-stone tower has suggested this method has good seismic resilience: &quot;With regard to the current Algerian seismic design regulation, the results obtained in terms of time period, frequency, storey drifts and displacements showed that the… (Diar Es Saada massive precut stone)… tower can be considered as an earthquake-resistant building fulfilling the required structural safety conditions.&quot;
* Aesthetics. Compared to concrete and other materials, massive precut stone construction yields visually striking and distinctive buildings that showcase the natural beauty of stone.
* Environmental benefits. The use of a material with lower embedded carbon contributes to a more sustainable building process, minimizing the environmental impact. Lower carbon emissions: load-bearing stone construction emits around one-tenth the carbon as a comparable concrete building. As 80% of energy is non-grid fossil fuel, and construction is responsible for 8% of carbon emissions, the replacement of coal-burning concrete production with lower-energy dimension-stone production could have a substantial impact on net-zero goals.
* Reusability. When a building has reached the end of its usefulness, massive rectilinear ashlars are easily reused in new construction.
* Thermal performance. As with traditional stone construction, massive precut stone buildings benefit from excellent thermal mass, helping to regulate indoor temperatures and reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling.

==== History of massive precut stone ====
Fernand Pouillon pioneered the use of massive precut stone in modern architecture. During the post-war period, his innovative approach to stone construction led to the development of numerous noteworthy projects, with a particular focus on housing. Throughout his long career, Pouillon played a crucial role in the development and popularization of massive precut stone construction techniques. His pioneering work laid the foundation for subsequent architects to build upon and innovate, leading to the resurgence and expansion of this construction method in the 2020s, with the rise of interest in low-carbon durable construction.

=== Tensioned stone ===

Post-tensioned stone (PT stone) is a high-performance composite construction material: stone held in compression with tension elements. The tension elements can be connected to the outside of the stone, but more typically uses tendons threaded internally through a duct formed from aligned drilled holes.

Post-tensioned stone may consist of a single piece, but drill limitations and other considerations mean it is typically an assembly of multiple components with mortar between pieces. PT stone has been used in both vertical columns (posts), and in horizontal beams (lintels). It has also been used in more unusual engineering applications: arch stabilization, flexible foot bridges, and cantilevered sculptures.

Tensioned stone has a close affiliation with massive precut stone as two central techniques of modern stonemasonry.

==== Rationale ====
&quot;Post-tensioned stone increases the failure load of stone in bending, but also the stiffness of a structure by reducing joint cracking. This method of construction is widely used for concrete structures, but the advantages of using similar techniques with stone are only just being realised&quot;.

Stone has great compressive strength, so is ideal in compressive structures like stone arches.
 However, it has relatively weak flexural strength (compared to steel or wood), so in isolation cannot be safely used in wide spans under tension.

For concrete, this problem has been long solved: in addition to conventional tensile reinforcement, engineers developed prestressed concrete methods starting around 1888. Such tension-reinforced concrete applications combine compressive strength with pre-stressed tensile compression for combined strength much greater than either of the individual components, and have been in wide use for decades. As for concrete, post-tensioning maintains stone in compression, thereby increasing its strength.

Post-tensioning is achieved steel tendons either threaded through ducts within the stone elements or along their surface. Once the stone components are in place, the tendons are tensioned using hydraulic jacks, and the force is transferred to the stone through anchorages located at the ends of the tendons. The tensioning process imparts a compressive force to the stone, which improves its capacity to resist tensile stresses that could otherwise cause cracking or failure.

===== Energy use and carbon emissions =====
Stone is &quot;natural precast concrete&quot;, so only needs to be cut (and strength tested) and post-tensioned prior to use in construction. Compared to concrete and steel, post-tensioned stone production has dramatically lower energy costs, with concomitant lower carbon emissions.

== History of stonemasonry ==

Stonemasonry is one of the earliest trades in civilization&#x27;s history. During the time of the Neolithic Revolution and domestication of non-human animals, people learned how to use fire to create quicklime, plasters, and mortars. They used these to fashion homes for themselves with mud, straw or stone, and masonry was born.

The Ancients heavily relied on the stonemason to build the most impressive and long-lasting monuments to their civilizations. The Egyptians built their pyramids, the civilizations of Central America had their step pyramids, the Persians their palaces, the Greeks their temples, and the Romans their public works and wonders (See Roman Architecture). People of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as at Dholavira made entire cities characterized by stone architecture. Among the famous ancient stonemasons is Sophroniscus, the father of Socrates, who was a stone-cutter.

Castle building was an entire industry for the medieval stonemasons. When the Western Roman Empire fell, building in dressed stone decreased in much of Western Europe, and there was a resulting increase in timber-based construction. Stonework experienced a resurgence in the 9th and 10th centuries in Europe, and by the 12th-century religious fervour resulted in the construction of thousands of impressive churches and cathedrals in stone across Western Europe.

Medieval stonemasons&#x27; skills were in high demand, and members of the guild, gave rise to three classes of stonemasons: apprentices, journeymen, and master masons. Apprentices were indentured to their masters as the price for their training, journeymen were qualified craftsmen who were paid by the day, and master masons were considered freemen who could travel as they wished to work on the projects of the patrons and could operate as self-employed craftsmen and train apprentices. During the Renaissance, the stonemason&#x27;s guild admitted members who were not stonemasons, and eventually evolved into the Society of Freemasonry; fraternal groups which observe the traditional culture of stonemasons but are not typically involved in modern construction projects.

A medieval stonemason would often carve a personal symbol onto their block to differentiate their work from that of other stonemasons. This also provided a simple &quot;quality assurance&quot; system.

The Renaissance saw stonemasonry return to the prominence and sophistication of the Classical age. The rise of the humanist philosophy gave people the ambition to create marvelous works of art. The centre stage for the Renaissance would prove to be Italy, where Italian city-states such as Florence erected great structures, including the Florence Cathedral, the Fountain of Neptune, and the Laurentian Library, which was planned and built by Michelangelo Buonarroti, a famous sculptor of the Renaissance.

When Europeans settled the Americas, they brought the stonemasonry techniques of their respective homelands with them. Settlers used what materials were available, and in some areas, stone was the material of choice. In the first waves, building mimicked that of Europe, to eventually be replaced by unique architecture later on.

In the 20th century, stonemasonry saw its most radical changes in the way the work is accomplished. Prior to the first half of the century, most heavy work was executed by draft animals or human muscle power. With the arrival of the internal combustion engine, many of these hard aspects of the trade have been made simpler and easier. Cranes and forklifts have made moving and laying heavy stones relatively easy for the stonemasons. Motor powered mortar mixers have saved much in time and energy as well. Compressed-air powered tools have made working of stone less time-intensive. Petrol and electric-powered abrasive saws can cut through stone much faster and with more precision than chiseling alone. Cemented carbide-tipped chisels can stand up to much more abuse than the steel and iron chisels made by blacksmiths of old.

== Tools ==

Stonemasons use a wide variety of tools to handle and shape stone blocks (ashlar) and slabs into finished articles. The basic tools for shaping the stone are a mallet, chisels, and a metal straight edge. With these one can make a flat surface – the basis of all stonemasonry.

Chisels come in a variety of sizes and shapes, dependent upon the function for which they are being used and have many different names depending on locality. There are different chisels for different materials and sizes of material being worked, for removing large amounts of material and for putting a fine finish on the stone. A drove chisel is used for smoothing off roughly finished stones.

Mixing mortar is normally done today with mortar mixers which usually use a rotating drum or rotating paddles to mix the mortar.

The masonry trowel is used for the application of the mortar between and around the stones as they are set into place. Filling in the gaps (joints) with mortar is referred to as pointing. Pointing in smaller joints can be accomplished using tuck pointers, pointing trowels, and margin trowels, among other tools.

A mason&#x27;s hammer has a long thin head and is called a Punch Hammer. It would be used with a chisel or splitter for a variety of purposes

A walling hammer (catchy hammer) can be used in place of a hammer and chisel or pincher to produce rubble or pinnings or snecks.

Stonemasons use a lewis together with a crane or block and tackle to hoist building stones into place.

Today power tools such as compressed-air chisels, abrasive spinners, and angle grinders are much used: these save time and money, but are hazardous and require just as much skill as the hand tools that they augment. But many of the basic tools of stonemasonry have remained virtually the same throughout vast amounts of time, even thousands of years, for instance when comparing chisels that can be bought today with chisels found at the pyramids of Giza the common sizes and shapes are virtually unchanged.

== Training ==

Traditionally medieval stonemasons served a seven-year apprenticeship. A similar system still operates today.

A modern apprenticeship lasts three years. This combines on-site learning through personal experience, the experience of the tradesmen, and college work where apprentices are given an overall experience of the building, hewing and theory work involved in masonry. In some areas, colleges offer courses which teach not only the manual skills but also related fields such as drafting and blueprint reading or construction conservation. Electronic Stonemasonry training resources enhance traditional delivery techniques. Hands-on workshops are a good way to learn about stonemasonry also. Those wishing to become stonemasons should have little problem working at heights, possess reasonable hand-eye coordination, be moderately physically fit, and have basic mathematical ability. Most of these things can be developed while learning.

The modern stonemason undergoes comprehensive training, both in the classroom and in the working environment. Hands-on skill is complemented by an intimate knowledge of each stone type, its application, and best uses, and how to work and fix each stone in place. The mason may be skilled and competent to carry out one or all of the various branches of stonemasonry. In some areas, the trend is towards specialization, in other areas towards adaptability.

Today&#x27;s stonemasons undergo training that is quite comprehensive and is done both in the work environment and in the classroom. It isn&#x27;t enough to have hands-on skills only. One must also have knowledge of the types of stones as well as its best uses and how to work it as well as how to fix it in place.

== Types of stone ==

Stonemasons use all types of natural stone: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary; while some also use artificial stone as well.

=== Igneous stones ===
*Granite is one of the hardest stones, and requires such different techniques to sedimentary stones that it is virtually a separate trade. With great persistence, simple mouldings can and have been carved from granite, for example in many Cornish churches and in the city of Aberdeen. Generally, however, it is used for purposes that require its strength and durability, such as kerbstones, countertops, flooring, and breakwaters.
*Igneous stone ranges from very soft rocks such as pumice and scoria to somewhat harder rocks such as tuff to the hardest rocks such as granite and basalt.

=== Metamorphic ===
*Marble is a fine, easily worked stone, that comes in various colours, but mainly white. It has traditionally been used for carving statues, and for facings of many Byzantine and Italian Renaissance buildings. Prominent Greek sculptors, such as Antenor (6th century BC), Phidias and Critias (5th century BC), Praxiteles (4th century BC) and others used mainly the marble of Paros and Thassos islands, and the whitest and brightest of all (although not the finest), the Pentelikon marble. Their work was preceded by older sculptors from Mesopotamia and Egypt, but the Greeks were unmatched in plasticity and realistic (re)presentation, either of Gods (Apollo, Aphrodite, Hermes, Zeus, etc.), or humans (Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Phryne, etc.). The famous Acropolis of Athens is said to be constructed using the Pentelicon marble. The traditional home of the marble industry is the area around Carrara in Italy, from where a bright and fine, whitish marble is extracted in vast quantities.
*Slate is a popular choice of stone for memorials and inscriptions, as its fine grain and hardness means it leaves details very sharp. Its tendency to split into thin plates has also made it a popular roofing material.

=== Sedimentary ===
Many of the world&#x27;s most famous buildings have been built of sedimentary stone, from Durham Cathedral to St Peter&#x27;s in Rome. There are two main types of sedimentary stone used in masonry work, limestones and sandstones. Examples of limestones include Bath and Portland stone. Yorkstone and Sydney sandstone are the most commonly used sandstone.

<text>The Boerboel () is a South African breed of large dog of mastiff type, used as a family guard dog. It is large, with a short coat, strong bone structure and well-developed muscles.

It is recognised by the Kennel Union of Southern Africa, but not by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

== Legislation ==
In South Africa, the &quot;Animal Improvement Act (62 of 1998)&quot; defines a breed of animal indigenous to or developed in the republic to be a landrace, therefore the Boerboel is regarded as a landrace in the republic. The Act grants powers to a registered &quot;animal breeders society&quot;, and the South African Boerboel Breeders&#x27; Society (SABBS) is a registered animal breeders society. The SABBS is the only organisation authorised under the Act to officially register Boerboels. As legally registered custodian of the Boerboel dog breed, SABBS is responsible for the standards that govern identification, recording, evaluation and improvement of the breed. The Kennel Union of Southern Africa recognises that Boerboels were registered on its books.

== History ==

The name Boerboel derives from the Afrikaans words , meaning farmer, and , a shortening of , meaning bulldog.

The Boerboel descends from an old colonial cross-breed of mastiffs and bulldogs used both as a guard dog on remote farms and estates and for big game hunting, and known as the Boer Dog or Boer Hunting Dog. An account from 1909 describes this cross-breed as the best dog for hunting leopards and baboons in packs; a leopard with a leg caught in a trap can be killed by a pack of them. The &quot;Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa&quot; describes the Boer Mastiff as an excellent fighter; one killed leopards in four single combats over a number of years, but was killed by a fifth.

Breeding of the Boerboel began in the 1950s. A breed association, the Suid-Afrikaanse Boerboel Telersvereniging or South African Boerboel Breeders Association, was established in 1983. A new association, the South African Boerboel Breeders&#x27; Society, was formed in 2012 and registered with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2014.

== Characteristics ==
The Boerboel is a large dog, with a strong bone structure and well-developed muscles. The head is large and the muzzle is short.

The coat is short and sleek with dense hair coverage. The recognised colours are brindle, fawn, and brown; it may or may not have a black mask. There is one minor divergence between breed standards; the Kennel Union of South Africa does not accept black but SABBS does.

The dogs show courage when threatened; they may display aggression toward other dogs or strangers.

== Health ==
The Boerboel may develop hip or elbow dysplasia, vaginal hyperplasia, ectropion and entropion. Juvenile epilepsy (with attacks brought on by metabolic changes or stress) has been observed.

== Restrictions ==

Ownership of the dog is limited by law in many countries. Importation to Romania was prohibited in 2002, and ownership restricted to those with a court permit. The breed was banned in Denmark in 2010, in 2011 Russia designated it an &quot;especially dangerous breed&quot;, subject to mandatory registration and certification, and Ukraine has classified it as a dangerous dog, subject to mandatory microchipping, muzzle and civil liability insurance.

It is also banned or prohibited in Bermuda, France, Mauritius, and Qatar; importation is prohibited in the Faroe Islands, Singapore, Tunisia and the Turks and Caicos islands.

<text>Bryan Talbot (born 24 February 1952) is a British comics artist and writer, best known as the creator of &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; and its sequels &quot;Heart of Empire&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Luther Arkwright&quot;, as well as the &quot;Grandville&quot; series of books. He collaborated with his wife, Mary M. Talbot to produce &quot;Dotter of Her Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, which won the 2012 Costa biography award.

==Early life==
Bryan Talbot was born in Wigan, Lancashire, on 24 February 1952. He attended Wigan Grammar School, the Wigan School of Art, and Harris College in Preston, Lancashire, from which he graduated with a degree in Graphic Design.

==Career==
Talbot began his comics work in the underground comix scene of the late 1960s. In 1969 his first work appeared as illustrations in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, the British Tolkien Society magazine, followed in 1972 by a weekly strip in his college newspaper. He continued in the scene after leaving college, producing &quot;Brainstorm Comix&quot;, the first three of which formed &quot;The Chester P. Hackenbush Trilogy&quot;, a character reworked by Alan Moore as Chester Williams for &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;.

Talbot started &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; in 1978. It was originally published in &quot;Near Myths&quot; and continued on over the years in other publications, including &quot;Pssst!&quot; and by the publisher Valkyrie Press. It was eventually collected into one volume by Dark Horse Comics. Along with Raymond Briggs&#x27; &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;, it is considered one of the first British graphic novels. In the early-to-mid 1980s Talbot provided art for some of &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s flagship serials, producing three series of &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;, as well as occasional strips for &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;.

Talbot moved to the U.S. market in the 1990s and principally worked for DC Comics on titles such as &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot;. Talbot collaborated with Neil Gaiman on &quot;The Sandman&quot; and provided art for the &quot;Fables &amp; Reflections&quot;, &quot;A Game of You&quot;, and &quot;Worlds&#x27; End&quot; story arcs. His &quot;The Tale of One Bad Rat&quot; (1994) deals with a girl&#x27;s recovery from childhood sexual abuse. He drew &quot;The Nazz&quot; limited series which was written by Tom Veitch and worked with Tom&#x27;s brother Rick Veitch on &quot;Teknophage&quot;, one of a number of mini-series he drew for Tekno Comix. Talbot has illustrated cards for the &quot;&quot; collectible card game. He has illustrated Bill Willingham&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot;, as well as returning to the Luther Arkwright universe with &quot;Heart of Empire&quot;.

In 2006, he announced the graphic novel &quot;Metronome&quot;, an existential, textless erotically charged visual poem, written under the pseudonym Véronique Tanaka. He admitted that he was the author in 2009. Talbot turned down an offer to appear in character as Tanaka for an in-store signing of the work.

In 2007 he released &quot;Alice in Sunderland&quot;, which documents the connections between Lewis Carroll, Alice Liddell, and the Sunderland and Wearside area. He wrote and drew the layouts for &quot;Cherubs!&quot;, which he describes as &quot;an irreverent fast-paced supernatural comedy-adventure.&quot;

In 2019 it was reported that Talbot was producing the third installment in the Arkwright series, titled &quot;The Legend of Luther Arkwright&quot;, which was published by Dark Horse in 2022.

In April 2024, it was announced that Talbot will be inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Awards Hall of Fame, the highest accolade for comic writers and artists from across the world.

<doc id="214938" wikidata="Q223739" url="?curid=214938" title="Leptin">
<text>Leptin (from Greek λεπτός &quot;leptos&quot;, &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;light&quot; or &quot;small&quot;), also known as obese protein, is a protein hormone predominantly made by adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue). Its primary role is likely to regulate long-term energy balance. 

As one of the major signals of energy status, leptin levels influence appetite, satiety, and motivated behaviors oriented toward the maintenance of energy reserves (e.g., feeding, foraging behaviors). 

The amount of circulating leptin correlates with the amount of energy reserves, mainly triglycerides stored in adipose tissue. High leptin levels are interpreted by the brain that energy reserves are high, whereas low leptin levels indicate that energy reserves are low, in the process adapting the organism to starvation through a variety of metabolic, endocrine, neurobiochemical, and behavioral changes.

Leptin is coded for by the &quot;LEP&quot; gene. Leptin receptors are expressed by a variety of brain and peripheral cell types. These include cell receptors in the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei, as well as other parts of the hypothalamus and dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, consequently mediating feeding.

Although regulation of fat stores is deemed to be the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes, as evidenced by its many sites of synthesis other than fat cells, and the many cell types beyond hypothalamic cells that have leptin receptors. Many of these additional functions are yet to be fully defined.

In obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin occurs (similar to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes), resulting in an inability to detect satiety despite high energy stores and high levels of leptin. 

== Effects ==
Predominantly, the &quot;energy expenditure hormone&quot; leptin is made by adipose cells, and is thus labeled &quot;fat cell-specific&quot;. In the context of its effects, the short describing words &quot;central&quot;, &quot;direct&quot;, and &quot;primary&quot; are not used interchangeably. In regard to the hormone leptin, central vs peripheral refers to the hypothalamic portion of the brain vs non-hypothalamic &quot;location of action&quot; of leptin; direct vs indirect refers to whether there is no intermediary, or there is an intermediary in the &quot;mode of action&quot; of leptin; and primary vs secondary is an arbitrary description of a particular &quot;function&quot; of leptin.

;Location of action: The &quot;central&quot; location of action (&quot;effect&quot;) of the fat cell-specific hormone leptin is the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, which is a part of the central nervous system. Non-hypothalamic targets of leptin are referred to as &quot;peripheral&quot; targets. There is a different relative importance of central and peripheral leptin interactions under different physiologic states, and variations among species.

;Mode of action: Leptin acts &quot;directly&quot; on leptin receptors in the cell membrane of different types of cells in the human body in particular, and in vertebrates in general. The leptin receptor is found on a wide range of cell types. It is a &quot;single-transmembrane-domain&quot; type I cytokine receptor, a special class of cytokine receptors. Further, leptin interacts with other hormones and energy regulators, &quot;indirectly&quot; mediating the effects of: insulin, glucagon, insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, glucocorticoids, cytokines, and metabolites.

;Function: The &quot;primary&quot; function of the hormone leptin is the regulation of adipose tissue mass through central hypothalamus mediated effects on hunger, food energy use, physical exercise, and energy balance. Outside the brain, in the periphery of the body, leptin&#x27;s &quot;secondary&quot; functions are: modulation of energy expenditure, modulation between fetal and maternal metabolism, and that of a permissive factor in puberty, activator of immune cells, activator of beta islet cells, and growth factor.

=== Central nervous system ===

In vertebrates, the nervous system consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The primary effect of leptins is in the hypothalamus, a part of the central nervous system. Leptin receptors are expressed not only in the hypothalamus but also in other brain regions, particularly in the hippocampus. Thus some leptin receptors in the brain are classified as &quot;central&quot; (hypothalamic) and some as &quot;peripheral&quot; (non-hypothalamic).

As scientifically known so far, the general effects of leptin in the central nervous system are:
*Deficiency of leptin has been shown to alter brain proteins and neuronal functions of obese mice that can be restored by leptin injection 
*Leptin receptor signaling in the hippocampus enhances learning and memory Treatment with leptin has been shown to enhance learning and memory in animal models.
*In humans, low circulating plasma leptin has been associated with cognitive changes associated with anorexia, depression, and Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease 
*Studies in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have shown that chronic administration of leptin can ameliorate brain pathology and improve cognitive performance, by reducing b-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated Tau, two hallmarks of Alzheimer&#x27;s pathology.

Generally, leptin is thought to enter the brain at the choroid plexus, where the intense expression of a form of leptin receptor molecule could act as a transport mechanism.

Increased levels of melatonin causes a downregulation of leptin, however, melatonin also appears to increase leptin levels in the presence of insulin, therefore causing a decrease in appetite during sleeping. Partial sleep deprivation has also been associated with decreased leptin levels.

Mice with type 1 diabetes treated with leptin or leptin plus insulin, compared to insulin alone had better metabolic profiles: blood sugar did not fluctuate so much; cholesterol levels decreased; less body fat formed.

==== Hypothalamus ====

Leptin acts on receptors in the lateral hypothalamus to inhibit hunger and the medial hypothalamus to stimulate satiety.
*In the lateral hypothalamus, leptin inhibits hunger by
**counteracting the effects of neuropeptide Y, a potent hunger promoter secreted by cells in the gut and in the hypothalamus
**counteracting the effects of anandamide, another potent hunger promoter that binds to the same receptors as THC
*In the medial hypothalamus, leptin stimulates satiety by
**promoting the synthesis of α-MSH, a hunger suppressant
Thus, a lesion in the lateral hypothalamus causes anorexia (due to a lack of hunger signals) and a lesion in the medial hypothalamus causes excessive hunger (due to a lack of satiety signals).
This appetite inhibition is long-term, in contrast to the rapid inhibition of hunger by cholecystokinin (CCK) and the slower suppression of hunger between meals mediated by PYY3-36. The absence of leptin (or its receptor) leads to uncontrolled hunger and resulting obesity. Fasting or following a very-low-calorie diet lowers leptin levels. 
Leptin levels change more when food intake decreases than when it increases. The dynamics of leptin due to an acute change in energy balance may be related to appetite and eventually, to food intake rather than fat stores.

* It controls food intake and energy expenditure by acting on receptors in the mediobasal hypothalamus.

Leptin binds to neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons in the arcuate nucleus in such a way as to decrease the activity of these neurons. Leptin signals to the hypothalamus which produces a feeling of satiety. Moreover, leptin signals may make it easier for people to resist the temptation of foods high in calories.

Leptin receptor activation inhibits neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and activates α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). The NPY neurons are a key element in the regulation of hunger; small doses of NPY injected into the brains of experimental animals stimulates feeding, while selective destruction of the NPY neurons in mice causes them to become anorexic. Conversely, α-MSH is an important mediator of satiety, and differences in the gene for the α-MSH receptor are linked to obesity in humans.

Leptin interacts with six types of receptors (Ob-Ra–Ob-Rf, or LepRa-LepRf), which in turn are encoded by a single gene, LEPR. Ob-Rb is the only receptor isoform that can signal intracellularly via the JAK-STAT and MAPK signal transduction pathways, and is present in hypothalamic nuclei.

Once leptin has bound to the Ob-Rb receptor, it activates the stat3, which is phosphorylated and travels to the nucleus to effect changes in gene expression, one of the main effects being the down-regulation of the expression of endocannabinoids, responsible for increasing hunger. In response to leptin, receptor neurons have been shown to remodel themselves, changing the number and types of synapses that fire onto them.

=== Circulatory system ===
The role of leptin/leptin receptors in modulation of T cell activity and the innate immune system was shown in experimentation with mice. It modulates the immune response to atherosclerosis, of which obesity is a predisposing and exercise a mitigating factor.

Exogenous leptin can promote angiogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor levels.

Hyperleptinemia produced by infusion or adenoviral gene transfer decreases blood pressure in rats.

Leptin microinjections into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) have been shown to elicit sympathoexcitatory responses, and potentiate the cardiovascular responses to activation of the chemoreflex.

=== Fetal lung ===
In fetal lung, leptin is induced in the alveolar interstitial fibroblasts (&quot;lipofibroblasts&quot;) by the action of PTHrP secreted by formative alveolar epithelium (endoderm) under moderate stretch. The leptin from the mesenchyme, in turn, acts back on the epithelium at the leptin receptor carried in the alveolar type II pneumocytes and induces surfactant expression, which is one of the main functions of these type II pneumocytes.

=== Reproductive system ===
==== Ovulatory cycle ====
In mice, and to a lesser extent in humans, leptin is required for male and female fertility. Ovulatory cycles in females are linked to energy balance (positive or negative depending on whether a female is losing or gaining weight) and energy flux (how much energy is consumed and expended) much more than energy status (fat levels). When energy balance is highly negative (meaning the woman is starving) or energy flux is very high (meaning the woman is exercising at extreme levels, but still consuming enough calories), the ovarian cycle stops and females stop menstruating. Only if a female has an extremely low body fat percentage does energy status affect menstruation. Leptin levels outside an ideal range may have a negative effect on egg quality and outcome during &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization. Leptin is involved in reproduction by stimulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus.

==== Pregnancy ====
The placenta produces leptin. Leptin levels rise during pregnancy and fall after childbirth. Leptin is also expressed in fetal membranes and the uterine tissue. Uterine contractions are inhibited by leptin. Leptin plays a role in hyperemesis gravidarum (severe morning sickness of pregnancy), in polycystic ovary syndrome, and hypothalamic leptin is implicated in bone growth in mice.

==== Lactation ====
Immunoreactive leptin has been found in human breast milk; and leptin from mother&#x27;s milk has been found in the blood of suckling infant animals.

==== Puberty ====
Leptin along with kisspeptin controls the onset of puberty. High levels of leptin, as usually observed in obese females, can trigger neuroendocrine cascade resulting in early menarche. This may eventually lead to shorter stature as oestrogen secretion starts during menarche and causes early closure of epiphyses.

=== Bone ===
Leptin&#x27;s role in regulating bone mass was identified in 2000. Leptin can affect bone metabolism via direct signalling from the brain. Leptin decreases cancellous bone, but increases cortical bone. This &quot;cortical-cancellous dichotomy&quot; may represent a mechanism for enlarging bone size, and thus bone resistance, to cope with increased body weight.

Bone metabolism can be regulated by central sympathetic outflow, since sympathetic pathways innervate bone tissue. A number of brain-signalling molecules (neuropeptides and neurotransmitters) have been found in bone, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and neuropeptide Y. Leptin binds to its receptors in the hypothalamus, where it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism. Leptin may also act directly on bone metabolism via a balance between energy intake and the IGF-I pathway. There is a potential for treatment of diseases of bone formation - such as impaired fracture healing - with leptin.

=== Immune system ===
Factors that acutely affect leptin levels are also factors that influence other markers of inflammation, e.g., testosterone, sleep, emotional stress, caloric restriction, and body fat levels. While it is well-established that leptin is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response, it has been further theorized that leptin&#x27;s role as an inflammatory marker is to respond specifically to adipose-derived inflammatory cytokines.

In terms of both structure and function, leptin resembles IL-6 and is a member of the cytokine superfamily. Circulating leptin seems to affect the HPA axis, suggesting a role for leptin in stress response. Elevated leptin concentrations are associated with elevated white blood cell counts in both men and women.

Similar to what is observed in chronic inflammation, chronically elevated leptin levels are associated with obesity, overeating, and inflammation-related diseases, including hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. While leptin is associated with body fat mass, the size of individual fat cells, and overeating, it is not affected by exercise (for comparison, IL-6 is released in response to muscular contractions). Thus, it is speculated that leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammation. Leptin is a pro-angiogenic, pro-inflammatory, and mitogenic factor, the actions of which are reinforced through crosstalk with IL-1 family cytokines in cancer. High leptin levels have been also demonstrated in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Taken as such, increases in leptin levels (in response to caloric intake) function as an acute pro-inflammatory response mechanism to prevent excessive cellular stress induced by overeating. When high caloric intake overtaxes the ability of fat cells to grow larger or increase in number in step with caloric intake, the ensuing stress response leads to inflammation at the cellular level and ectopic fat storage, i.e., the unhealthy storage of body fat within internal organs, arteries, and/or muscle. The insulin increase in response to the caloric load provokes a dose-dependent rise in leptin, an effect potentiated by high cortisol levels. (This insulin-leptin relationship is notably similar to insulin&#x27;s effect on the increase of IL-6 gene expression and secretion from preadipocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner.) Furthermore, plasma leptin concentrations have been observed to gradually increase when acipimox is administered to prevent lipolysis, concurrent hypocaloric dieting and weight loss notwithstanding. Such findings appear to demonstrate high caloric loads in excess of storage rate capacities of fat cells lead to stress responses that induce an increase in leptin, which then operates as an adipose-derived inflammation stopgap signaling for the cessation of food intake so as to prevent adipose-derived inflammation from reaching elevated levels. This response may then protect against the harmful process of ectopic fat storage, which perhaps explains the connection between chronically elevated leptin levels and ectopic fat storage in obese individuals.

Leptin increases the production of leukocytes via actions on the hematopoietic niche, a pathway that is more active in sedentary mice and humans when compared to individuals who are physically active.

== Location of gene and structure of hormone ==
The &quot;Ob(Lep)&quot; gene (Ob for obese, Lep for leptin) is located on chromosome 7 in humans. Human leptin is a 16-kDa protein of 167 amino acids.

== Mutations ==
A human mutant leptin was first described in 1997, and subsequently six additional mutations were described. All of those affected were from Eastern countries; and all had variants of leptin not detected by the standard immunoreactive technique, so leptin levels were low or undetectable. The most recently described eighth mutation reported in January 2015, in a child with Turkish parents, is unique in that it &quot;is&quot; detected by the standard immunoreactive technique, where leptin levels are elevated; but the leptin does not turn on the leptin receptor, hence the patient has functional leptin deficiency. These eight mutations all cause extreme obesity in infancy, with hyperphagia.

=== Nonsense ===
A nonsense mutation in the leptin gene that results in a stop codon and lack of leptin production was first observed in mice. In the mouse gene, arginine-105 is encoded by CGA and only requires one nucleotide change to create the stop codon TGA. The corresponding amino acid in humans is encoded by the sequence CGG and would require two nucleotides to be changed to produce a stop codon, which is much less likely to happen.

=== Frameshift ===
A recessive frameshift mutation resulting in a reduction of leptin has been observed in two consanguineous children with juvenile obesity. A 2001 study of 13 people with a heterozygous frameshift mutation known as delta-G133 found that they had lower blood leptin levels than controls. There was an increased rate of obesity in these individuals, with 76% having a BMI of more than 30 compared to 26% in the control group.

=== Polymorphisms ===
A Human Genome Equivalent (HuGE) review in 2004 looked at studies of the connection between genetic mutations affecting leptin regulation and obesity. They reviewed a common polymorphism in the leptin gene (A19G; frequency 0.46), three mutations in the leptin receptor gene (Q223R, K109R, and K656N) and two mutations in the &quot;PPARG&quot; gene (P12A and C161T). They found no association between any of the polymorphisms and obesity.

A 2006 study found a link between the common LEP-2548 G/A genotype and morbid obesity in Taiwanese aborigines, but a 2014 meta-analysis did not, however, this polymorphism has been associated with weight gain in patients taking antipsychotics.

The LEP-2548 G/A polymorphism has been linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer, gestational diabetes, and osteoporosis.

Other rare polymorphisms have been found, but their association with obesity are not consistent.

=== Transversion ===
A single case of a homozygous transversion mutation of the gene encoding for leptin was reported in January 2015. It leads to functional leptin deficiency with high leptin levels in circulation. The transversion of (c.298G → T) changed aspartic acid to tyrosine at position 100 (p.D100Y). The mutant leptin could neither bind to nor activate the leptin receptor &quot;in vitro&quot;, nor in leptin-deficient mice &quot;in vivo&quot;. It was found in a two-year-old boy with extreme obesity with recurrent ear and pulmonary infections. Treatment with metreleptin led to &quot;rapid change in eating behavior, a reduction in daily energy intake, and substantial weight loss.&quot;

== Sites of synthesis ==
Leptin is produced primarily in the adipocytes of white adipose tissue. It also is produced by brown adipose tissue, placenta (syncytiotrophoblasts), ovaries, skeletal muscle, stomach (the lower part of the fundic glands), mammary epithelial cells, bone marrow, gastric chief cells, and P/D1 cells.

== Blood levels ==
Leptin circulates in blood in free form and bound to proteins.

=== Physiologic variation ===
Leptin levels vary exponentially, not linearly, with fat mass. Leptin levels in blood are higher between midnight and early morning, perhaps suppressing appetite during the night. The diurnal rhythm of blood leptin levels may be modified by meal-timing.

=== In specific conditions ===
In humans, many instances are seen where leptin dissociates from the strict role of communicating nutritional status between body and brain and no longer correlates with body fat levels:
* Leptin plays a critical role in the adaptive response to starvation.
* Leptin level is decreased after short-term fasting (24–72 hours), even when changes in fat mass are not observed.
* Serum level of leptin is reduced by sleep deprivation.
* Leptin levels are paradoxically increased in obesity.
* Leptin level is increased by emotional stress.
* Leptin level is chronically reduced by physical exercise training.
* Leptin level is decreased by increases in testosterone levels and increased by increases in estrogen levels.
* Leptin level is increased by insulin.
* Leptin release is increased by dexamethasone.
* In obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea, leptin level is increased, but decreased after the administration of continuous positive airway pressure. In non-obese individuals, however, restful sleep (i.e., 8–12 hours of unbroken sleep) can increase leptin to normal levels.

=== In mutations ===
All known leptin mutations except one are associated with low to undetectable immunoreactive leptin blood levels. The exception is a mutant leptin reported in January 2015 that is not functional, but is detected with standard immunoreactive methods. It was found in a massively obese -year-old boy who had high levels of circulating leptin that had no effect on leptin receptors, so he was functionally leptin-deficient.

== Role in disease ==
=== Obesity ===

Although leptin reduces appetite as a circulating signal, obese individuals generally exhibit a higher circulating concentration of leptin than normal weight individuals due to their higher percentage body fat. These people show resistance to leptin, similar to resistance of insulin in type 2 diabetes, with the elevated levels failing to control hunger and modulate their weight. A number of explanations have been proposed to explain this. An important contributor to leptin resistance is changes to leptin receptor signalling, particularly in the arcuate nucleus, however, deficiency of, or major changes to, the leptin receptor itself are not thought to be a major cause. Triglycerides crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) can induce leptin and insulin resistance in the hypothalamus. Triglycerides can also impair leptin transport across the BBB.

Studies on leptin cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels provide evidence for the reduction in leptin crossing the BBB and reaching obesity-relevant targets, such as the hypothalamus, in obese people. In humans it has been observed that the ratio of leptin in the CSF compared to the blood is lower in obese people than in people of a normal weight. The reason for this may be high levels of triglycerides affecting the transport of leptin across the BBB or due to the leptin transporter becoming saturated. Although deficits in the transfer of leptin from the plasma to the CSF is seen in obese people, they are still found to have 30% more leptin in their CSF than lean individuals. These higher CSF levels fail to prevent their obesity. Since the amount and quality of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus appears to be normal in the majority of obese humans (as judged from leptin-mRNA studies), it is likely that the leptin resistance in these individuals is due to a post leptin-receptor deficit, similar to the post-insulin receptor defect seen in type 2 diabetes.

When leptin binds with the leptin receptor, it activates a number of pathways. Leptin resistance may be caused by defects in one or more parts of this process, particularly the JAK/STAT pathway. Mice with a mutation in the leptin receptor gene that prevents the activation of STAT3 are obese and exhibit hyperphagia. The PI3K pathway may also be involved in leptin resistance, as has been demonstrated in mice by artificial blocking of PI3K signalling. The PI3K pathway also is activated by the insulin receptor and is therefore an important area where leptin and insulin act together as part of energy homeostasis. The insulin-pI3K pathway can cause POMC neurons to become insensitive to leptin through hyperpolarization.
Leptin is known to interact with amylin, a hormone involved in gastric emptying and creating a feeling of fullness. When both leptin and amylin were given to obese, leptin-resistant rats, sustained weight loss was seen. Due to its apparent ability to reverse leptin resistance, amylin has been suggested as possible therapy for obesity.

It has been suggested that the main role of leptin is to act as a starvation signal when levels are low, to help maintain fat stores for survival during times of starvation, rather than a satiety signal to prevent overeating. Leptin levels signal when an animal has enough stored energy to spend it in pursuits besides acquiring food. This would mean that leptin resistance in obese people is a normal part of mammalian physiology and possibly, could confer a survival advantage. Leptin resistance (in combination with insulin resistance and weight gain) is seen in rats after they are given unlimited access to palatable, energy-dense foods. This effect is reversed when the animals are put back on a low-energy diet. This also may have an evolutionary advantage: allowing energy to be stored efficiently when food is plentiful would be advantageous in populations where food frequently may be scarce.

A fad diet, the Rosedale diet is based on ideas about how leptin might affect weight. It is based on unsound science and marketed with unevidenced claims of health benefits.

=== Role in osteoarthritis with obesity ===

==== Obesity and osteoarthritis ====
Osteoarthritis and obesity are closely linked. Obesity is one of the most important preventable factors for the development of osteoarthritis.

Originally, the relationship between osteoarthritis and obesity was considered to be exclusively biomechanically based, according to which the excess weight caused the joint to become worn down more quickly. However, today we recognise that there is also a metabolic component which explains why obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis, not only for weight-bearing joints (for example, the knees), but also for joints that do not bear weight (for example, the hands). Consequently, it has been shown that decreasing body fat lessens osteoarthritis to a greater extent than weight loss per se. This metabolic component related with the release of systemic factors, of a pro-inflammatory nature, by the adipose tissues, which frequently are critically associated with the development of osteoarthritis.

Thus, the deregulated production of adipokines and inflammatory mediators, hyperlipidaemia, and the increase of systemic oxidative stress are conditions frequently associated with obesity, which can favour joint degeneration. Furthermore, many regulation factors have been implicated in the development, maintenance, and function, both of adipose tissues, as well as of the cartilage and other joint tissues. Alterations in these factors can be the additional link between obesity and osteoarthritis.

==== Leptin and osteoarthritis ====
Adipocytes interact with other cells through producing and secreting a variety of signalling molecules, including the cell signalling proteins known as adipokines. Certain adipokines can be considered as hormones, as they regulate the functions of organs at a distance, and several of them have been specifically involved in the physiopathology of joint diseases. In particular, there is one, leptin, which has been the focus of attention for research in recent years.

The circulating leptin levels are positively correlated with the Body Mass Index (BMI), more specifically with fatty mass, and obese individuals have higher leptin levels in their blood circulation, compared with non-obese individuals. In obese individuals, the increased circulating leptin levels induce unwanted responses, that is, reduced food intake or losing body weight does not occur as there is a resistance to leptin (ref 9). In addition to the function of regulating energy homeostasis, leptin carries out a role in other physiological functions such as neuroendocrine communication, reproduction, angiogenesis, and bone formation. More recently, leptin has been recognised as a cytokine factor as well as with pleiotropic actions also in the immune response and inflammation. For example, leptin can be found in the synovial fluid in correlation with the body mass index, and the leptin receptors are expressed in the cartilage, where leptin mediates and modulates many inflammatory responses that can damage cartilage and other joint tissues. Leptin has thus emerged as a candidate to link obesity and osteoarthritis and serves as an apparent objective as a nutritional treatment for osteoarthritis.

As in the plasma, the leptin levels in the synovial fluid are positively correlated with BMI. The leptin of the synovial fluid is synthesised at least partially in the joint and may originate in part in the circulation. Leptin has been shown to be produced by chondrocytes, as well as by other tissues in the joints, including the synovial tissue, osteophytes, the meniscus, and bone. An infrapatellar fat pad located extrasynovially within the knee joint is also adjacent to the synovial membrane and cartilage, and has recently been highly appreciated as an important source of leptin, as well as other adipokines and mediators that contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis 

The risk of suffering osteoarthritis can be decreased with weight loss. This reduction of risk is related in part with the decrease of the load on the joint, but also in the decrease of fatty mass, the central adipose tissue and the low-level inflammation associated with obesity and systemic factors. 

This growing evidence points to leptin as a cartilage degradation factor in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, and as a potential biomarker in the progression of the disease, which suggests that leptin, as well as regulation and signalling mechanisms, can be a new and promising target in the treatment of osteoarthritis, especially in obese patients. 

Obese individuals are predisposed to developing osteoarthritis, not only due to the excess mechanical load, but also due to the excess expression of soluble factors, that is, leptin and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to joint inflammation and cartilage destruction. As such, obese individuals are in an altered state, due to a metabolic insufficiency, which requires specific nutritional treatment capable of normalising the leptin production and reducing the systematic low-level inflammation, in order to reduce the harmful impact of these systematic mediators on the joint health. 

There are nutritional supplements and pharmacological agents capable of directing these factors and improving both conditions. 

== Therapeutic use ==

=== Leptin===

Leptin was approved in the United States in 2014 for use in congenital leptin deficiency and generalized lipodystrophy.

=== Analog metreleptin===
An analog of human leptin metreleptin (trade names Myalept, Myalepta) was first approved in Japan in 2013, in the United States in February 2014, and in Europe in 2018. In the US it is indicated as a treatment for complications of leptin deficiency, and for the diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia associated with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. In Europe based on EMA, metreleptin should be used in addition to diet to treat lipodystrophy, where patients have loss of fatty tissue under the skin and build-up of fat elsewhere in the body such as in the liver and muscles. The medicine is used in adults and children above the age of 2 years with generalised lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome and Lawrence syndrome); and in adults and children above the age of 12 years with partial lipodystrophy (including Barraquer-Simons syndrome), when standard treatments have failed.

The National Health Service in England will commission metreleptin treatment for all with congenital leptin deficiency regardless of age beginning on April 1, 2019.

== Research ==
Leptin is currently being evaluated as a potential target for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. It is hypothesized that the gradual loss of body fat mass, and more specifically the ensuing low leptin levels, escalate the preexisting drive for thinness into an obsessive-compulsive-like and addictive-like state. It was shown that short-term metreleptin treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa had rapid on-set of beneficial cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects. Among other things, depression, drive for activity, repetitive thoughts of food, inner restlessness, and weight phobia decreased rapidly. Whether metreleptin (or another leptin analogue) is a suitable treatment for anorexia nervosa is currently unknown. Potential side effects are weight loss and the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies.

== History ==
The leptin was discovered by Jeffrey Friedman in 1994 after several decades of research conducted by others institutions since 1950 on obese mouse models.

=== Identification of the encoding gene ===
In 1949, a non-obese mouse colony being studied at the Jackson Laboratory produced a strain of obese offspring, suggesting that a mutation had occurred in a hormone regulating hunger and energy expenditure. Mice homozygous for the so-called ob mutation (ob/ob) ate voraciously and were massively obese. In the 1960s, a second mutation causing obesity and a similar phenotype was identified by Douglas Coleman, also at the Jackson Laboratory, and was named diabetes (db), as both ob/ob and db/db were obese. In 1990 Rudolph Leibel and Jeffrey M. Friedman reported mapping of the &quot;db&quot; gene.

Consistent with Coleman&#x27;s and Leibel&#x27;s hypothesis, several subsequent studies from Leibel&#x27;s and Friedman&#x27;s labs and other groups confirmed that the ob gene encoded a novel hormone that circulated in blood and that could suppress food intake and body weight in ob and wild type mice, but not in db mice.

In 1994, Friedman&#x27;s laboratory reported the identification of the gene. In 1995, Jose F. Caro&#x27;s laboratory provided evidence that the mutations in the mouse ob gene did not occur in humans. Furthermore, since ob gene expression was increased, not decreased, in human obesity, it suggested resistance to leptin to be a possibility. At the suggestion of Roger Guillemin, Friedman named this new hormone &quot;leptin&quot; from the Greek &quot;lepto&quot; meaning thin. Leptin was the first fat cell-derived hormone (adipokine) to be discovered.

Subsequent studies in 1995 confirmed that the db gene encodes the leptin receptor, and that it is expressed in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain known to regulate the sensation of hunger and body weight.

=== Recognition of scientific advances ===
Coleman and Friedman have been awarded numerous prizes acknowledging their roles in discovery of leptin, including the Gairdner Foundation International Award (2005), the Shaw Prize (2009), the Lasker Award, the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award and the King Faisal International Prize, Leibel has not received the same level of recognition from the discovery because he was omitted as a co-author of a scientific paper published by Friedman that reported the discovery of the gene. The various theories surrounding Friedman&#x27;s omission of Leibel and others as co-authors of this paper have been presented in a number of publications, including Ellen Ruppel Shell’s 2002 book &quot;The Hungry Gene&quot;.

The discovery of leptin also is documented in a series of books including &quot;Fat: Fighting the Obesity Epidemic&quot; by Robert Pool, &quot;The Hungry Gene&quot; by Ellen Ruppel Shell, and &quot;Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss and the Myths and Realities of Dieting&quot; by Gina Kolata. &quot;Fat: Fighting the Obesity Epidemic&quot; and &quot;Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss and the Myths and Realities of Dieting&quot; review the work in the Friedman laboratory that led to the cloning of the ob gene, while The &quot;Hungry Gene&quot; draws attention to the contributions of Leibel.

<text>The Adventures of Luther Arkwright is a nine-issue comic book limited series written and drawn by Bryan Talbot in the period 1978–1989. The story is adult in tone, with many mythological, historical, and political references, and a little explicit sex.

In 2003 English writer Warren Ellis called &quot;Arkwright&quot; &quot;probably the single most influential graphic novel to have come out of Britain to date... probably Anglophone comics&#x27; single most important experimental work&quot;. The series was nominated for eight Eagle Awards in 1988, winning four: Best New Comic, Favourite Character, and Best Comic Cover, with Talbot winning the award for Favourite Artist. In addition, the book was given the 1989 Mekon Award for &quot;Best British Work&quot; by the Society of Strip Illustration.

== Overview ==
The character of Luther Arkwright owes something to the influence of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Jerry Cornelius stories, though Moorcock and Talbot agree that the similarities between the characters are limited. 

Arkwright made his first appearance in the mid-1970s in &quot;The Papist Affair&quot;, a short strip for &quot;Brainstorm Comix&quot; where Arkwright teamed up with a group of cigar-chewing biker nuns to recover the sacred relics of &quot;St. Adolf of Nuremberg&quot; from &quot;a buncha male chauvinist priests&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Luther Arkwright&quot; is a work of apocalyptic science fiction set in parallel universes. The eponymous hero has the unique talent of being able to move between universes purely by force of will, and is aided by Rose Wylde, a telepath whose many incarnations across the parallels can communicate with one another. Luther and Rose are agents of a parallel universe known as &quot;zero-zero&quot;, whose stable position in the multiverse has allowed the development of a world at peace with itself and sufficiently high technology to monitor the parallels for signs of the malign influence of the &quot;Disruptors&quot;.

Most of the action in the story is set in a parallel world where the English Civil War has been indefinitely prolonged by the actions of the Disruptors, who are also responsible for unleashing &quot;Firefrost&quot;, a legendary artifact that is destabilizing the multiverse. Arkwright intervenes on the Royalist side to draw out the Disruptors and locate and destroy Firefrost. Along the way his unit is ambushed, and he is killed, only to return to life with his powers enhanced.

The storytelling of the early episodes is complex, with flashbacks to Arkwright&#x27;s upbringing by the Disruptors, escape to the parallel of his birth, and early missions for zero-zero intermingling with the course of his mission in neo-Cromwellian England, with story-telling techniques and art styles shifting to match. The scenes of Arkwright&#x27;s death and rebirth are particularly abstract and full of religious and mythological symbolism. The comic is unusual in being one of the few adventure stories where the readers and the protagonist both know from the beginning that he will die; only the event itself is not known.

The later parts of the story have a more straightforward, linear form. In the end, Arkwright, having completed his mission, renounces violence.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; had a start-and-stop publication history, beginning in 1978 and not being completed until 1989. The first parts of the story appeared as a five-part serial in the British underground comic &quot;Near Myths&quot; in 1978–1980.

The story continued in the comics anthology &quot;pssst!&quot; in 1982. After five more episodes, however, the story was interrupted when &quot;pssst!&quot; was canceled, less than half complete. Before shutting down, &quot;pssst!&quot;&#x27;s publisher, Serge Boissevain, collected all the &quot;Luther Arkwright&quot; stories — including the material from &quot;Near Myths&quot; — in a trade paperback called &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright Book 1: Rat Trap&quot;.

Between 1987 and 1989 Talbot completed the story, which was published as a series of nine standard comic books by Valkyrie Press, followed, at readers&#x27; request, by a tenth issue, titled &quot;ARKeology&quot;, containing articles about the history and production of the comic and some extended back story and character information.

In 1987, Serge Boissevain paid for the printing of the Valkyrie Press trade paperback, &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright Book 2: Transfiguration&quot;. In 1989, under the publisher name Proutt, he published the final trade paperback, &quot;Book 3: Götterdämmerung&quot;.

=== Later publications ===
The entire series was subsequently published in the United States by Dark Horse Comics. 

In 2005 the artwork was digitally remastered by Comics Centrum for an edition in Czech (&quot;Dobrodružství Luther Arkwrighta&quot;), allowing proper reproduction of both light and dark parts of &quot;tonal&quot; pages. The new artwork was also used for a French edition by Kymera Comics. Bryan Talbot has described the Czech edition as &quot;the best ever published&quot;. In 2006, the story was republished as a webcomic using the digitally remastered files at the official fan page.

=== Collected editions ===
* — introduction by Ramsey Campbell
* — introduction by Alan Moore
* — introduction by Iain Banks
* ; republished in 2004 and 2007
* — foreword by Michael Moorcock; also includes the 1999 sequel &quot;Heart of Empire&quot;

== Sequels ==
In 1999, Dark Horse Comics published Talbot&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Luther Arkwright&quot;, called &quot;Heart of Empire: The Legacy of Luther Arkwright&quot;.

A third story, &quot;The Legend of Luther Arkwright&quot;, was published in the UK in July 2022 by Jonathan Cape. The much delayed American edition by Dark Horse Comics is currently scheduled for December 2024. 

== In other media ==
===Audio adaptation===

In 2005, &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; was made into a full-cast, three-CD audio adventure by Big Finish Productions, starring David Tennant (cast near the time of the CD&#x27;s release as the Tenth Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) and Paul Darrow (Avon in &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;).

<text>James Quinn Wilson (May 27, 1931 – March 2, 2012) was an American political scientist and an authority on public administration. Most of his career was spent as a professor at UCLA and Harvard University. He was the chairman of the Council of Academic Advisors of the American Enterprise Institute, member of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1985–1990), and the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics. He was Director of Joint Center for Urban Studies at Harvard-MIT.

He was the former president of the American Political Science Association and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and Human Rights Foundation. He also was a co-author of a leading university textbook, &quot;American Government&quot;, and wrote many scholarly books and articles, and op-ed essays. He gained national attention for a 1982 article introducing the broken windows theory in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. In 2003, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.

== Career ==
He completed his B.A. at the University of Redlands in 1952, and he was its national collegiate debate champion in 1951 and 1952. He completed an M.A. (1957) and a Ph.D. (1959) in political science at the University of Chicago. From 1961 to 1987, he was the Shattuck Professor of Government at Harvard University.

His 1975 book &quot;Thinking About Crime&quot; put forward a novel theory of incapacitation as the most effective explanation for the reduction in crime rates observed where longer prison sentences were the norm. Criminals might not be deterred by the threat of longer sentences, but repeat offenders would be prevented from further offending, simply because they would be in jail rather than out on the street.

Wilson and George L. Kelling introduced the broken windows theory in the March 1982 edition of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. In an article titled &quot;Broken Windows&quot;, they argued that the symptoms of low-level crime and disorder (e.g. a broken window) create an environment that encourages more crimes, including serious ones.

From 1987 to 1997, he was the James Collins Professor of Management and Public Policy at the UCLA Anderson School of Management at UCLA. From 1998 to 2009, he was the Ronald Reagan Professor of Public Policy at Pepperdine University&#x27;s School of Public Policy.

Wilson authored the university text &quot;American Government&quot;, and coauthored later editions with John J. DiIulio, Jr. The text has been widely sold, though its use became controversial in later years after universities alleged it to have inaccuracies and &quot;right-wing bias&quot;.

Wilson was a former chairman of the White House Task Force on Crime (1966), of the National Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse Prevention (1972–1973) and a member of the Attorney General&#x27;s Task Force on Violent Crime (1981), the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1985–1990), and the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics. He was a former president of the American Political Science Association. He served on the board of directors for the New England Electric System (now National Grid USA), Protection One, RAND, and State Farm Mutual Insurance.

He was the chairman of the Council of Academic Advisors of the American Enterprise Institute. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the International Council of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation.

== Political views ==
Early in his career, Wilson was a liberal. Over time, his views shifted towards conservatism. As a young professor he &quot;voted for John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey and worked in the last&#x27;s presidential campaign.&quot; Wilson was later recognized as a leading conservative scholar, as indicated by his advisory position to the American Enterprise Institute.

Wilson was a staunch advocate for perseverance in the War on Drugs:

Even now, when the dangers of drug use are well understood, many educated people still discuss the drug problem in almost every way except the right way. They talk about the &quot;costs&quot; of drug use and the &quot;socioeconomic factors&quot; that shape that use. They rarely speak plainly—drug use is wrong because it&#x27;s immoral and it is immoral because it enslaves the mind and destroys the soul.

Wilson also pioneered the idea that public administration was increasingly replete with political calculations and concerns:

This is because our constitutional structure and our traditions afford individuals manifold opportunities not only to bring their special interests to the attention of public officials but also — and this the important thing — to compel officials to bargain and to make compromises. The nature of the governmental system gives private interests such good opportunities to participate in the making of public decisions that there is virtually no sphere of &#x27;administration&#x27; apart from politics.

Wilson studied conflict between &quot;amateur&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; participants in politics, especially in the Democratic Party in the 1960s. He argued that professional politicians, parties, political machines and informal power structures were essential to the functioning of the government and its formal power structures. In 1962, he wrote that &quot;If legal power is badly fragmented among many independent elective officials and widely decentralized among many levels of government, the need for informal methods of assembling power becomes great.&quot;

== Personal life ==
James Quinn Wilson was born in Denver, Colorado, but grew up mostly in Long Beach, Calif. His father, Claude Wilson, worked as a salesman. His mother, Marie, was a stay-at-home mom.

He served in the US Navy during the Korean War, but did not see combat.

Wilson enjoyed scuba diving.

On September 13, 1952, Wilson married Roberta (Evans) Wilson; they originally met in high school, and remained married until his death, nearly sixty years later. The couple had two children: a son, Matthew, born in 1960, and a daughter, Annie, born in 1964.
== Death ==
Wilson died in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 2, 2012, from complications caused by leukemia.

<doc id="214945" wikidata="Q411288" url="?curid=214945" title="Tetanus toxin">
<text>Tetanus toxin (TeNT) is an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by the vegetative cell of &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot; in anaerobic conditions, causing tetanus. It has no known function for clostridia in the soil environment where they are normally encountered. It is also called spasmogenic toxin, tentoxilysin, tetanospasmin, or tetanus neurotoxin. The LD50 of this toxin has been measured to be approximately 2.5–3 ng/kg, making it second only to the related botulinum toxin (LD50 2 ng/kg) as the deadliest toxin in the world. However, these tests are conducted solely on mice, which may react to the toxin differently from humans and other animals.

&quot;C. tetani&quot; also produces the exotoxin tetanolysin, a hemolysin, that causes destruction of tissues.

==Distribution==
Tetanus toxin spreads through tissue spaces into the lymphatic and vascular systems. It enters the nervous system at the neuromuscular junctions and migrates through nerve trunks and into the central nervous system (CNS) by retrograde axonal transport by using dyneins.

== Structure ==
The tetanus toxin protein has a molecular weight of 150 kDa. It is translated from the &quot;tetX&quot; gene as one protein which is subsequently cleaved into two parts: a 100 kDa heavy or B-chain and a 50 kDa light or A-chain. The chains are connected by a disulfide bond.
* The B-chain binds to disialogangliosides (GD2 and GD1b) on the neuronal membrane and contains a translocation domain which aids the movement of the protein across that membrane and into the neuron.
* The A-chain, an M27-family zinc endopeptidase, attacks the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP).

The TetX gene encoding this protein is located on the PE88 plasmid.

Several structures of the binding domain and the peptidase domain have been solved by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the PDB.

==Mechanism of action==

The mechanism of TeNT action can be broken down and discussed in these different steps:

;Transport
:# Specific binding in the periphery neurons
:# Retrograde axonal transport to the CNS inhibitory interneurons
:# Transcytosis from the axon into the inhibitory interneurons
;Action
:# Temperature- and pH-mediated translocation of the light chain into the cytosol
:# Reduction of the disulfide bridge to thiols, severing the link between the light and heavy chain
:# Cleavage of synaptobrevin at -Gln76-Phe- bond

The first three steps outline the travel of tetanus toxin from the peripheral nervous system to where it is taken up to the CNS and has its final effect. The last three steps document the changes necessary for the final mechanism of the neurotoxin.

Transport to the CNS inhibitory interneurons begins with the B-chain mediating the neurospecific binding of TeNT to the nerve terminal membrane. It binds to GT1b polysialogangliosides, similarly to the &quot;C. botulinum&quot; neurotoxin. It also binds to another poorly characterized GPI-anchored protein receptor more specific to TeNT. Both the ganglioside and the GPI-anchored protein are located in lipid microdomains and both are requisite for specific TeNT binding. Once it is bound, the neurotoxin is then endocytosed into the nerve and begins to travel through the axon to the spinal neurons. The next step, transcytosis from the axon into the CNS inhibitory interneuron, is one of the least understood parts of TeNT action. At least two pathways are involved, one that relies on the recycling of synaptic vesicle 2 (SV2) system and one that does not.

Once the vesicle is in the inhibitory interneuron, its translocation is mediated by pH and temperature, specifically a low or acidic pH in the vesicle and standard physiological temperatures. Once the toxin has been translocated into the cytosol, chemical reduction of the disulfide bond to separate thiols occurs, mainly by the enzyme NADPH-thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin. The light chain is then free to cleave the Gln76-Phe77 bond of synaptobrevin. Cleavage of synaptobrevin affects the stability of the SNARE core by restricting it from entering the low-energy conformation, which is the target for NSF binding. Synaptobrevin is an integral V-SNARE necessary for vesicle fusion to membranes. The final target of TeNT is the cleavage of synaptobrevin and, even in low doses, has the effect of interfering with exocytosis of neurotransmitters from inhibitory interneurons. The blockage of the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine is the direct cause of the physiological effects that TeNT induces. GABA inhibits motor neurons, so by blocking GABA, tetanus toxin causes violent spastic paralysis. The action of the A-chain also stops the affected neurons from releasing excitatory transmitters, by degrading the protein synaptobrevin 2. The combined consequence is dangerous overactivity in the muscles from the smallest sensory stimuli, as the damping of motor reflexes is inhibited, leading to generalized contractions of the agonist and antagonist musculature, termed a &quot;tetanic spasm&quot;.

==Clinical significance==
The clinical manifestations of tetanus are caused when tetanus toxin blocks inhibitory impulses, by interfering with the release of neurotransmitters, including glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. These inhibitory neurotransmitters inhibit the alpha motor neurons. With diminished inhibition, the resting firing rate of the alpha motor neuron increases, producing rigidity, unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Characteristic features are risus sardonicus (a rigid smile), trismus (commonly known as &quot;lock-jaw&quot;), and opisthotonus (rigid, arched back). Seizures may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected. Tetanospasmin appears to prevent the release of neurotransmitters by selectively cleaving a component of synaptic vesicles called synaptobrevin II. Loss of inhibition also affects preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the lateral gray matter of the spinal cord and produces sympathetic hyperactivity and high circulating catecholamine levels. Hypertension and tachycardia alternating with hypotension and bradycardia may develop.

Tetanic spasms can occur in a distinctive form called &quot;opisthotonos&quot; and be sufficiently severe to fracture long bones. The shorter nerves are the first to be inhibited, which leads to the characteristic early symptoms in the face and jaw, &quot;risus sardonicus&quot; and lockjaw.

==Immunity and vaccination==
Due to its extreme potency, even a lethal dose of tetanospasmin may be insufficient to provoke an immune response. Naturally acquired tetanus infections thus do not usually provide immunity to subsequent infections. Immunization (which is impermanent and must be repeated periodically) instead uses the less deadly toxoid derived from the toxin, as in the tetanus vaccine and some combination vaccines (such as DTP).

<doc id="214946" wikidata="Q936070" url="?curid=214946" title="Trismus">
<text>Trismus is a condition of restricted opening of the mouth. The term was initially used in the setting of tetanus. Trismus may be caused by spasm of the muscles of mastication or a variety of other causes. Temporary trismus occurs much more frequently than permanent trismus. It is known to interfere with eating, speaking, and maintaining proper oral hygiene. This interference, specifically with an inability to swallow properly, results in an increased risk of aspiration. In some instances, trismus presents with altered facial appearance. The condition may be distressing and painful. Examination and treatments requiring access to the oral cavity can be limited, or in some cases impossible, due to the nature of the condition itself.

==Definition==
Trismus is defined as painful restriction in opening the mouth due to a muscle spasm, however it can also refer to limited mouth opening of any cause. Another definition of trismus is simply a limitation of movement. Historically and commonly, the term &quot;lockjaw&quot; was sometimes used as a synonym for both trismus and tetanus.

Normal mouth-opening ranges from 35 to 45 mm. Males usually have slightly greater mouth opening than females. (40–60 mm, average of 50 mm). The normal lateral movement is 8–12 mm, and normal protrusive movement is approximately 10 mm. Some have distinguished mild trismus as 20–30 mm interincisal opening, moderate as 10–20 mm and severe as less than 10 mm.

Trismus is derived from the Greek word &quot;trigmos/trismos&quot; meaning &quot;a scream; a grinding, rasping or gnashing&quot;.

==Differential diagnosis==
Traditionally causes of trismus are divided into intra-articular (factors within the temporomandibular joint [TMJ]) and extra-articular (factors outside the joint, see table).
===Joint problems===

====Ankylosis====
* True bony ankylosis: can result from trauma to chin, infections and from prolonged immobilization following condylar fracture
** Treatment – several surgical procedures are used to treat bony ankylosis, e.g.: Gap arthroplasty using interpositional materials between the cut segments.
* Fibrous ankylosis: usually results due to trauma and infection
** Treatment – trismus appliances in conjunction with physical therapy.

====Arthritis synovitis====

====Meniscus pathology====

===Extra-articular causes===

====Infection====
* Odontogenic- Pulpal
** Periodontal
** Pericoronal
* Non-odontogenic- Peritonsillar abscess
** Tetanus
** Meningitis
** Brain abscess
** Parotid abscess
* The hallmark of a masticatory space infection is trismus or infection in anterior compartment of lateral pharyngeal space results in trismus. If these infections are unchecked, can spread to various facial spaces of the head and neck and lead to serious complications such as cervical cellulitis or mediastinitis.
** Treatment: Elimination of etiologic agent along with antibiotic coverage
* Trismus or lock jaw due to masseter muscle spasm, can be a primary presenting symptom in tetanus, Caused by &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;, where tetanospasmin (toxin) is responsible for muscle spasms.
** Prevention: primary immunization (DPT)

====Dental treatment====
* Dental trismus is defined by difficulty in opening the jaw. It is a temporary condition that usually lasts no more than two weeks. Dental trismus is caused by an injury to the masticatory muscles, such as opening the jaw for an extended period of time or having a needle pass through a muscle. Typical dental anesthesia for the lower jaw involves inserting a needle into or through a muscle. In these cases it is usually the medial pterygoid or the buccinator muscles.
* Oral surgery procedures, as in the extraction of lower molar teeth, may cause trismus as a result either of inflammation to the muscles of mastication or direct trauma to the TMJ.
* Barbing of needles at the time of injection followed by tissue damage on withdrawal of the barbed needle causes post-injection persistent paresthesia, trismus and paresis.
** Treatment: in acute phase:
*** Heat therapy
*** Analgesics
*** A soft diet
*** Muscle relaxants (if necessary)
*** Note: When acute phase is over the patient should be advised to initiate physiotherapy for opening and closing mouth.

====Trauma====
Fractures, particularly those of the mandible and fractures of zygomatic arch and zygomatic arch complex, accidental incorporation of foreign bodies due to external traumatic injury.
Treatment: fracture reduction, removal of foreign bodies with antibiotic coverage

====TMJ disorders====
* Extra-capsular disorders – Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome
* Intra-capsular problems – Disc displacement, arthritis, fibrosis, etc.
* Acute closed locked conditions – displaced meniscus

====Tumors and oral care====
Rarely, trismus is a symptom of nasopharyngeal or infratemporal tumors/ fibrosis of temporalis tendon, when patient has limited mouth opening, always premalignant conditions like oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) should also be considered in differential diagnosis.

====Drug therapy====
Succinyl choline, phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants causes trismus as a secondary effect. Trismus can be seen as an extra-pyramidal side-effect of metoclopromide, phenothiazines and other medications.

====Radiotherapy and chemotherapy====
* Complications of radiotherapy:
** Osteoradionecrosis may result in pain, trismus, suppuration and occasionally a foul smelling wound.
** When muscles of mastication are within the field of radiation, it leads to fibrosis and result in decreased mouth opening.
* Complications of Chemotherapy:
** Oral mucosal cells have high growth rate and are susceptible to the toxic effects of chemotherapy, which lead to stomatitis.

====Congenital and developmental causes====
* Hypertrophy of coronoid process causes interference of coronoid against the anteromedial margin of the zygomatic arch.
** Treatment: Coronoidectomy
* Trismus-pseudo-camtodactyly syndrome is a rare combination of hand, foot and mouth abnormalities and trismus.

====Miscellaneous disorders====
* Functional disorders ( neuro-psychiatric), the emotional conflict are converted into a physical symptom. E.g.: trismus
* Scleroderma: A condition marked by edema and induration of the skin involving facial region can cause trismus

===Common causes===
* Pericoronitis (inflammation of soft tissue around impacted third molar) is the most common cause of trismus.
* Inflammation of muscles of mastication. It is a frequent sequel to surgical removal of mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth). The condition is usually resolved on its own in 10–14 days, during which time eating and oral hygiene are compromised. The application of heat (e.g. heat bag extraorally, and warm salt water intraorally) may help, reducing the severity and duration of the condition.
* Peritonsillar abscess, a complication of tonsillitis which usually presents with sore throat, dysphagia, fever, and change in voice.
* Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD).
* Trismus is often mistaken as a common temporary side effect of many stimulants of the sympathetic nervous system. Users of amphetamines as well as many other pharmacological agents commonly report bruxism as a side-effect; however, it is sometimes mis-referred to as trismus. Users&#x27; jaws do not lock, but rather the muscles become tight and the jaw clenched. It is still perfectly possible to open the mouth.
* Submucous fibrosis.
* Fracture of the zygomatic arch.
* Oral sex

===Other causes===
* Acute osteomyelitis
* Ankylosis of the TMJ (fibrous or bony)
* Condylar fracture or other trauma.
* Gaucher disease which is caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.
* Giant cell arteritis
* Sympathomimetic drugs, such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, methylphenidate, ethylphenidate, and related substances.
* Infection
* Local anesthesia (dental injections into the infratemporal fossa)
* Needle prick to the medial pterygoid muscle
* Oral submucous fibrosis.
* Radiation therapy to the head and neck.
* Tetanus, also called &quot;lockjaw&quot; for this reason
* Malignant hyperthermia
* Malaria severa
* Secondary to neuroleptic drug use
* Malignant otitis externa
* Mumps
* Peritonsillar abscess
* Retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal abscess
* Seizure
* Stroke
* Toothache

==Diagnostic approach==

X-ray/CT scan taken from the TMJ to see if there is any damage to the TMJ and surrounding structures.

==Treatment==
Treatment requires treating the underlying condition with dental treatments, speech therapy for swallowing difficulty and mouth opening restrictions, physical therapy, and passive range of motion devices. Additionally, control of symptoms with pain medications (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and warm compresses may be used.

Splints have been used.

==History==
Historically, the term trismus was used to describe the early effects of tetany, also called &quot;lockjaw&quot;.

<doc id="214948" wikidata="Q297868" url="?curid=214948" title="X86 assembly language">
<text>x86 assembly language is a family of low-level programming languages that are used to produce object code for the x86 class of processors. These languages provide backward compatibility with CPUs dating back to the Intel 8008 microprocessor, introduced in April 1972. As assembly languages, they are closely tied to the architecture&#x27;s machine code instructions, allowing for precise control over hardware.

In x86 assembly languages, mnemonics are used to represent fundamental CPU instructions, making the code more human-readable compared to raw machine code. Each mnemonics corresponds to a basic operation performed by the processor, such as arithmetic calculations, data movement, or control flow decisions. Assembly languages are most commonly used in applications where performance and efficiency are critical. This includes real-time embedded systems, operating-system kernels, and device drivers, all of which may require direct manipulation of hardware resources.

Additionally, compilers for high-level programming languages sometimes generate assembly code as an intermediate step during the compilation process. This allows for optimization at the assembly level before producing the final machine code that the processor executes.

== Keyword ==
Reserved keywords of x86 assembly language
==Mnemonics and opcodes==

Each instruction in the x86 assembly language is represented by a mnemonic which often combines with one or more operands to translate into one or more bytes known as an opcode. For example, the NOP instruction translates to the opcode 0x90, and the HLT instruction translates to 0xF4. There are potential opcodes without documented mnemonics, which different processors may interpret differently. Using such opcodes can cause a program to behave inconsistently or even generate exceptions on some processors.

==Syntax==
x86 assembly language has two primary syntax branches: &quot;Intel syntax&quot; and &quot;AT&amp;T syntax&quot;. Intel syntax is dominant in the DOS and Windows environments, while AT&amp;T syntax is dominant in Unix-like systems, as Unix was originally developed at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. Below is a summary of the main differences between &quot;Intel syntax&quot; and &quot;AT&amp;T syntax&quot;:

Many x86 assemblers use &quot;Intel syntax&quot;, including FASM, MASM, NASM, TASM, and YASM. The GNU Assembler, which originally used &quot;AT&amp;T syntax&quot;, has supported both syntaxes since version 2.10 via the &quot;codice_1&quot; directive. A quirk in the AT&amp;T syntax for x86 is that x87 floating-point operands are reversed, an inherited bug from the original AT&amp;T assembler.

The AT&amp;T syntax is nearly universal across other architectures (retaining the same operand order for the instruction); it was originally designed for PDP-11 assembly. In contrast, the Intel syntax is specific to the x86 architecture and is the one used in the x86 platform&#x27;s official documentation. The Intel 8080, which predates the x86 architecture, also uses the &quot;destination-first&quot; order for instruction.

==Registers ==

x86 processors feature a set of registers that serve as storage for binary data and addresses during program execution. These registers are categorized into general-purpose registers, segment registers, the instruction pointer, the FLAGS register, and various extension registers introduced in later processor models. Each register has specific functions in addition to their general capabilities:

=== General-purpose registers ===
* AX (Accumulator register): Primarily used in arithmetic, logic, and data transfer operations. It is favored by instructions that perform multiplication and division, and by string load and store operations.
* BX (Base register): Base pointer for memory access. It can hold the base address of data structures and is useful in indexed addressing modes, particularly with the instruction.
* CX (Count register): Serves as a counter in loop, string, and shift/rotate instructions. Iterative operations often use CX to determine the number of times a loop or operation should execute.
* DX (Data register): Used in conjuction with AX for multiplication and division operations that produce results larger than 16 bits. It also holds I/O port addresses in IN and OUT instructions.
* SP (Stack pointer): Points to the top of stack in memory. It is automatically updated during and operations.
* BP (Base Pointer): Points to the top of the call stack. It is primarily used to access function parameters and local variables within the call stack.
* SI (Source Index): Used as a pointer to the source in string and memory array operations. Instructions like (move string) use SI to read data from memory.
* DI (Destination Index): Serves as a pointer to the destination in string and memory array operations. It works alongside SI in instructions that copy or compare data, writing results to memory. 
Along with the general registers there are additionally the:
* Instruction Pointer (IP): Holds the offset address of the next instruction to be executed within the code segment (CS). It points to the first byte of the next instruction. While the IP register cannot be accessed directly by programmers, its value changes through control flow instructions such as jumps, calls, and interrupts, which alter the flow of execution.
* FLAGS register: Contains a set of status, control, and system flags that reflect the outcome of operations and control the processor&#x27;s operations. 
* Segment registers (CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, SS): Determine where a 64k segment starts (no FS &amp; GS in 80286 &amp; earlier)
* Extra extension registers (MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, etc.) (Pentium &amp; later only).

The IP register points to the memory offset of the next instruction in the code segment (it points to the first byte of the instruction). The IP register cannot be accessed by the programmer directly.

The x86 registers can be used by using the MOV instructions. For example, in Intel syntax:
mov ax, 1234h ; copies the value 1234hex (4660d) into register AX
mov bx, ax ; copies the value of the AX register into the BX register

==Segmented addressing==

The x86 architecture in real and virtual 8086 mode uses a process known as segmentation to address memory, not the flat memory model used in many other environments. Segmentation involves composing a memory address from two parts, a &quot;segment&quot; and an &quot;offset&quot;; the segment points to the beginning of a 64 KiB (64×210) group of addresses and the offset determines how far from this beginning address the desired address is. In segmented addressing, two registers are required for a complete memory address. One to hold the segment, the other to hold the offset. In order to translate back into a flat address, the segment value is shifted four bits left (equivalent to multiplication by 24 or 16) then added to the offset to form the full address, which allows breaking the 64k barrier through clever choice of addresses, though it makes programming considerably more complex.

In real mode/protected only, for example, if DS contains the hexadecimal number and DX contains the number they would together point to the memory address . Therefore, the CPU can address up to 1,048,576 bytes (1 MB) in real mode. By combining &quot;segment&quot; and &quot;offset&quot; values we find a 20-bit address.

The original IBM PC restricted programs to 640 KB but an expanded memory specification was used to implement a bank switching scheme that fell out of use when later operating systems, such as Windows, used the larger address ranges of newer processors and implemented their own virtual memory schemes.

Protected mode, starting with the Intel 80286, was utilized by OS/2. Several shortcomings, such as the inability to access the BIOS and the inability to switch back to real mode without resetting the processor, prevented widespread usage. The 80286 was also still limited to addressing memory in 16-bit segments, meaning only 216 bytes (64 kilobytes) could be accessed at a time.
To access the extended functionality of the 80286, the operating system would set the processor into protected mode, enabling 24-bit addressing and thus 224 bytes of memory (16 megabytes).

In protected mode, the segment selector can be broken down into three parts: a 13-bit index, a &quot;Table Indicator&quot; bit that determines whether the entry is in the GDT or LDT and a 2-bit &quot;Requested Privilege Level&quot;; see x86 memory segmentation.

When referring to an address with a segment and an offset the notation of &quot;segment:offset&quot; is used, so in the above example the &quot;flat address&quot; 0xEB5CE can be written as 0xDEAD:0xCAFE or as a segment and offset register pair; DS:DX.

There are some special combinations of segment registers and general registers that point to important addresses:
*CS:IP (CS is &quot;Code Segment&quot;, IP is &quot;Instruction Pointer&quot;) points to the address where the processor will fetch the next byte of code.
*SS:SP (SS is &quot;Stack Segment&quot;, SP is &quot;Stack Pointer&quot;) points to the address of the top of the stack, i.e. the most recently pushed byte.
*SS:BP (SS is &quot;Stack Segment&quot;, BP is &quot;Stack Frame Pointer&quot;) points to the address of the top of the stack frame, i.e. the base of the data area in the call stack for the currently active subprogram.
*DS:SI (DS is &quot;Data Segment&quot;, SI is &quot;Source Index&quot;) is often used to point to string data that is about to be copied to ES:DI.
*ES:DI (ES is &quot;Extra Segment&quot;, DI is &quot;Destination Index&quot;) is typically used to point to the destination for a string copy, as mentioned above.

The Intel 80386 featured three operating modes: real mode, protected mode and virtual mode. The protected mode which debuted in the 80286 was extended to allow the 80386 to address up to 4 GB of memory, the all new virtual 8086 mode (&quot;VM86&quot;) made it possible to run one or more real mode programs in a protected environment which largely emulated real mode, though some programs were not compatible (typically as a result of memory addressing tricks or using unspecified op-codes).

The 32-bit flat memory model of the 80386&#x27;s extended protected mode may be the most important feature change for the x86 processor family until AMD released x86-64 in 2003, as it helped drive large scale adoption of Windows 3.1 (which relied on protected mode) since Windows could now run many applications at once, including DOS applications, by using virtual memory and simple multitasking.

==Execution modes==
The x86 processors support five modes of operation for x86 code, Real Mode, Protected Mode, Long Mode, Virtual 86 Mode, and System Management Mode, in which some instructions are available and others are not. A 16-bit subset of instructions is available on the 16-bit x86 processors, which are the 8086, 8088, 80186, 80188, and 80286. These instructions are available in real mode on all x86 processors, and in 16-bit protected mode (80286 onwards), additional instructions relating to protected mode are available. On the 80386 and later, 32-bit instructions (including later extensions) are also available in all modes, including real mode; on these CPUs, V86 mode and 32-bit protected mode are added, with additional instructions provided in these modes to manage their features. SMM, with some of its own special instructions, is available on some Intel i386SL, i486 and later CPUs. Finally, in long mode (AMD Opteron onwards), 64-bit instructions, and more registers, are also available. The instruction set is similar in each mode but memory addressing and word size vary, requiring different programming strategies.

The modes in which x86 code can be executed in are:
* Real mode (16-bit)
** 20-bit segmented memory address space (meaning that only 1 MB of memory can be addressed— actually since 80286 a little more through HMA), direct software access to peripheral hardware, and no concept of memory protection or multitasking at the hardware level. Computers that use BIOS start up in this mode.
* Protected mode (16-bit and 32-bit)
** Expands addressable physical memory to 16 MB and addressable virtual memory to 1 GB. Provides privilege levels and protected memory, which prevents programs from corrupting one another. 16-bit protected mode (used during the end of the DOS era) used a complex, multi-segmented memory model. 32-bit protected mode uses a simple, flat memory model.
* Long mode (64-bit)
** Mostly an extension of the 32-bit (protected mode) instruction set, but unlike the 16–to–32-bit transition, many instructions were dropped in the 64-bit mode. Pioneered by AMD.
* Virtual 8086 mode (16-bit)
** A special hybrid operating mode that allows real mode programs and operating systems to run while under the control of a protected mode supervisor operating system
* System Management Mode (16-bit)
** Handles system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, and proprietary OEM designed code. It is intended for use only by system firmware. All normal execution, including the operating system, is suspended. An alternate software system (which usually resides in the computer&#x27;s firmware, or a hardware-assisted debugger) is then executed with high privileges.

===Switching modes===
The processor runs in real mode immediately after power on, so an operating system kernel, or other program, must explicitly switch to another mode if it wishes to run in anything but real mode. Switching modes is accomplished by modifying certain bits of the processor&#x27;s control registers after some preparation, and some additional setup may be required after the switch.

===Examples===
With a computer running legacy BIOS, the BIOS and the boot loader run in Real mode. The 64-bit operating system kernel checks and switches the CPU into Long mode and then starts new kernel-mode threads running 64-bit code.

With a computer running UEFI, the UEFI firmware (except CSM and legacy Option ROM), the UEFI boot loader and the UEFI operating system kernel all run in Long mode.

==Instruction types==
In general, the features of the modern x86 instruction set are:

* A compact encoding
** Variable length and alignment independent (encoded as little endian, as is all data in the x86 architecture)
** Mainly one-address and two-address instructions, that is to say, the first operand is also the destination.
** Memory operands as both source and destination are supported (frequently used to read/write stack elements addressed using small immediate offsets).
** Both general and implicit register usage; although all seven (counting codice_2) general registers in 32-bit mode, and all fifteen (counting codice_3) general registers in 64-bit mode, can be freely used as accumulators or for addressing, most of them are also &quot;implicitly&quot; used by certain (more or less) special instructions; affected registers must therefore be temporarily preserved (normally stacked), if active during such instruction sequences.
* Produces conditional flags implicitly through most integer ALU instructions.
* Supports various addressing modes including immediate, offset, and scaled index but not PC-relative, except jumps (introduced as an improvement in the x86-64 architecture).
* Includes floating point to a stack of registers.
* Contains special support for atomic read-modify-write instructions (codice_4, codice_5/codice_6, codice_7, and integer instructions which combine with the codice_8 prefix)
* SIMD instructions (instructions which perform parallel simultaneous single instructions on many operands encoded in adjacent cells of wider registers).

===Stack instructions===
The x86 architecture has hardware support for an execution stack mechanism. Instructions such as codice_9, codice_10, codice_11 and codice_12 are used with the properly set up stack to pass parameters, to allocate space for local data, and to save and restore call-return points. The codice_12 &quot;size&quot; instruction is very useful for implementing space efficient (and fast) calling conventions where the callee is responsible for reclaiming stack space occupied by parameters.

When setting up a stack frame to hold local data of a recursive procedure there are several choices; the high level codice_14 instruction (introduced with the 80186) takes a &quot;procedure-nesting-depth&quot; argument as well as a &quot;local size&quot; argument, and &quot;may&quot; be faster than more explicit manipulation of the registers (such as codice_15 ; codice_16 ; codice_17). Whether it is faster or slower depends on the particular x86-processor implementation as well as the calling convention used by the compiler, programmer or particular program code; most x86 code is intended to run on x86-processors from several manufacturers and on different technological generations of processors, which implies highly varying microarchitectures and microcode solutions as well as varying gate- and transistor-level design choices.

The full range of addressing modes (including &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;base+offset&quot;) even for instructions such as codice_9 and codice_10, makes direct usage of the stack for integer, floating point and address data simple, as well as keeping the ABI specifications and mechanisms relatively simple compared to some RISC architectures (require more explicit call stack details).

===Integer ALU instructions===
x86 assembly has the standard mathematical operations, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23 and codice_24 (for signed integers), with codice_25 and codice_26 (for unsigned integers); the logical operators codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, codice_30; bitshift arithmetic and logical, codice_31/codice_32 (for signed integers), codice_33/codice_34 (for unsigned integers); rotate with and without carry, codice_35/codice_36, codice_37/codice_38, a complement of BCD arithmetic instructions, codice_39, codice_40, codice_41 and others.

===Floating-point instructions===
x86 assembly language includes instructions for a stack-based floating-point unit (FPU). The FPU was an optional separate coprocessor for the 8086 through the 80386, it was an on-chip option for the 80486 series, and it is a standard feature in every Intel x86 CPU since the 80486, starting with the Pentium. The FPU instructions include addition, subtraction, negation, multiplication, division, remainder, square roots, integer truncation, fraction truncation, and scale by power of two. The operations also include conversion instructions, which can load or store a value from memory in any of the following formats: binary-coded decimal, 32-bit integer, 64-bit integer, 32-bit floating-point, 64-bit floating-point or 80-bit floating-point (upon loading, the value is converted to the currently used floating-point mode). x86 also includes a number of transcendental functions, including sine, cosine, tangent, arctangent, exponentiation with the base 2 and logarithms to bases 2, 10, or &quot;e&quot;.

The stack register to stack register format of the instructions is usually codice_42 or codice_43, where codice_44 is equivalent to codice_45, and codice_46 is one of the 8 stack registers (codice_45, codice_48, ..., codice_49). Like the integers, the first operand is both the first source operand and the destination operand. codice_50 and codice_51 should be singled out as first swapping the source operands before performing the subtraction or division. The addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, store and comparison instructions include instruction modes that pop the top of the stack after their operation is complete. So, for example, codice_52 performs the calculation codice_53, then removes codice_45 from the top of stack, thus making what was the result in codice_48 the top of the stack in codice_45.

===SIMD instructions===
Modern x86 CPUs contain SIMD instructions, which largely perform the same operation in parallel on many values encoded in a wide SIMD register. Various instruction technologies support different operations on different register sets, but taken as complete whole (from MMX to SSE4.2) they include general computations on integer or floating-point arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, shift, minimization, maximization, comparison, division or square root). So for example, codice_57 performs 4 parallel 16-bit (indicated by the codice_58) integer adds (indicated by the codice_59) of codice_60 values to codice_61 and stores the result in codice_60. Streaming SIMD Extensions or SSE also includes a floating-point mode in which only the very first value of the registers is actually modified (expanded in SSE2). Some other unusual instructions have been added including a sum of absolute differences (used for motion estimation in video compression, such as is done in MPEG) and a 16-bit multiply accumulation instruction (useful for software-based alpha-blending and digital filtering). SSE (since SSE3) and 3DNow! extensions include addition and subtraction instructions for treating paired floating-point values like complex numbers.

These instruction sets also include numerous fixed sub-word instructions for shuffling, inserting and extracting the values around within the registers. In addition there are instructions for moving data between the integer registers and XMM (used in SSE)/FPU (used in MMX) registers.

=== Memory instructions ===
The x86 processor also includes complex addressing modes for addressing memory with an immediate offset, a register, a register with an offset, a scaled register with or without an offset, and a register with an optional offset and another scaled register. So for example, one can encode codice_63 as a single instruction which loads 32 bits of data from the address computed as codice_64 offset from the codice_65 selector, and stores it to the codice_66 register. In general x86 processors can load and use memory matched to the size of any register it is operating on. (The SIMD instructions also include half-load instructions.)

Most 2-operand x86 instructions, including integer ALU instructions,
use a standard &quot;addressing mode byte&quot;
often called the MOD-REG-R/M byte.
Many 32-bit x86 instructions also have a SIB addressing mode byte that follows the MOD-REG-R/M byte.

In principle, because the instruction opcode is separate from the addressing mode byte, those instructions are orthogonal because any of those opcodes can be mixed-and-matched with any addressing mode.
However, the x86 instruction set is generally considered non-orthogonal because many other opcodes have some fixed addressing mode (they have no addressing mode byte), and every register is special.

The x86 instruction set includes string load, store, move, scan and compare instructions (codice_67, codice_68, codice_69, codice_70 and codice_71) which perform each operation to a specified size (codice_72 for 8-bit byte, codice_58 for 16-bit word, codice_74 for 32-bit double word) then increments/decrements (depending on DF, direction flag) the implicit address register (codice_75 for codice_67, codice_77 for codice_68 and codice_70, and both for codice_69 and codice_71). For the load, store and scan operations, the implicit target/source/comparison register is in the codice_82, codice_83 or codice_66 register (depending on size). The implicit segment registers used are codice_65 for codice_75 and codice_87 for codice_77. The codice_89 or codice_90 register is used as a decrementing counter, and the operation stops when the counter reaches zero or (for scans and comparisons) when inequality is detected. Unfortunately, over the years the performance of some of these instructions became neglected and in certain cases it is now possible to get faster results by writing out the algorithms yourself. Intel and AMD have refreshed some of the instructions though, and a few now have very respectable performance, so it is recommended that the programmer should read recent respected benchmark articles before choosing to use a particular instruction from this group.

The stack is a region of memory and an associated ‘stack pointer’, which points to the bottom of the stack. The stack pointer is decremented when items are added (‘push’) and incremented after things are removed (‘pop’). In 16-bit mode, this implicit stack pointer is addressed as SS:[SP], in 32-bit mode it is SS:[ESP], and in 64-bit mode it is [RSP]. The stack pointer actually points to the last value that was stored, under the assumption that its size will match the operating mode of the processor (i.e., 16, 32, or 64 bits) to match the default width of the codice_9/codice_10/codice_11/codice_12 instructions. Also included are the instructions codice_14 and codice_96 which reserve and remove data from the top of the stack while setting up a stack frame pointer in codice_97/codice_2/codice_3. However, direct setting, or addition and subtraction to the codice_100/codice_101/codice_102 register is also supported, so the codice_14/codice_96 instructions are generally unnecessary.

This code is the beginning of a function typical for a high-level language when compiler optimisation is turned off for ease of debugging:

 push rbp ; Save the calling function’s stack frame pointer (rbp register)
 mov rbp, rsp ; Make a new stack frame below our caller’s stack
 sub rsp, 32 ; Reserve 32 bytes of stack space for this function’s local variables.
 ; Local variables will be below rbp and can be referenced relative to rbp,
 ; again best for ease of debugging, but for best performance rbp will not
 ; be used at all, and local variables would be referenced relative to rsp
 ; because, apart from the code saving, rbp then is free for other uses.
 … … ; However, if rbp is altered here, its value should be preserved for the caller.
 mov [rbp-8], rdx ; Example of writing to a local variable (by its memory location) from register rdx

...is functionally equivalent to just:
 enter 32, 0

Other instructions for manipulating the stack include codice_105(32-bit) / codice_106(64-bit) and codice_107 for storing and retrieving the EFLAGS (32-bit) / RFLAGS (64-bit) register.

Values for a SIMD load or store are assumed to be packed in adjacent positions for the SIMD register and will align them in sequential little-endian order. Some SSE load and store instructions require 16-byte alignment to function properly. The SIMD instruction sets also include &quot;prefetch&quot; instructions which perform the load but do not target any register, used for cache loading. The SSE instruction sets also include non-temporal store instructions which will perform stores straight to memory without performing a cache allocate if the destination is not already cached (otherwise it will behave like a regular store.)

Most generic integer and floating-point (but no SIMD) instructions can use one parameter as a complex address as the second source parameter. Integer instructions can also accept one memory parameter as a destination operand.

==Program flow==
The x86 assembly has an unconditional jump operation, codice_108, which can take an immediate address, a register or an indirect address as a parameter (note that most RISC processors only support a link register or short immediate displacement for jumping).

Also supported are several conditional jumps, including codice_109 (jump on zero), codice_110 (jump on non-zero), codice_111 (jump on greater than, signed), codice_112 (jump on less than, signed), codice_113 (jump on above/greater than, unsigned), codice_114 (jump on below/less than, unsigned). These conditional operations are based on the state of specific bits in the (E)FLAGS register. Many arithmetic and logic operations set, clear or complement these flags depending on their result. The comparison codice_115 (compare) and codice_116 instructions set the flags as if they had performed a subtraction or a bitwise AND operation, respectively, without altering the values of the operands. There are also instructions such as codice_117 (clear carry flag) and codice_118 (complement carry flag) which work on the flags directly. Floating point comparisons are performed via codice_119 or codice_120 instructions which eventually have to be converted to integer flags.

Each jump operation has three different forms, depending on the size of the operand. A &quot;short&quot; jump uses an 8-bit signed operand, which is a relative offset from the current instruction. A &quot;near&quot; jump is similar to a short jump but uses a 16-bit signed operand (in real or protected mode) or a 32-bit signed operand (in 32-bit protected mode only). A &quot;far&quot; jump is one that uses the full segment base:offset value as an absolute address. There are also indirect and indexed forms of each of these.

In addition to the simple jump operations, there are the codice_11 (call a subroutine) and codice_12 (return from subroutine) instructions. Before transferring control to the subroutine, codice_11 pushes the segment offset address of the instruction following the codice_11 onto the stack; codice_12 pops this value off the stack, and jumps to it, effectively returning the flow of control to that part of the program. In the case of a codice_126, the segment base is pushed following the offset; codice_127 pops the offset and then the segment base to return.

There are also two similar instructions, codice_128 (interrupt), which saves the current (E)FLAGS register value on the stack, then performs a codice_126, except that instead of an address, it uses an &quot;interrupt vector&quot;, an index into a table of interrupt handler addresses. Typically, the interrupt handler saves all other CPU registers it uses, unless they are used to return the result of an operation to the calling program (in software called interrupts). The matching return from interrupt instruction is codice_130, which restores the flags after returning. &quot;Soft Interrupts&quot; of the type described above are used by some operating systems for system calls, and can also be used in debugging hard interrupt handlers. &quot;Hard interrupts&quot; are triggered by external hardware events, and must preserve all register values as the state of the currently executing program is unknown. In Protected Mode, interrupts may be set up by the OS to trigger a task switch, which will automatically save all registers of the active task.

==Examples==
The following examples use the so-called &quot;Intel-syntax flavor &quot;as used by the assemblers Microsoft MASM, NASM and many others. (Note: There is also an alternative &quot;AT&amp;T-syntax flavor&quot; where the order of source and destination operands are swapped, among many other differences.)

 syscall ; _exit(0)
Running it under strace verifies that no extra system calls are made in the process. The printf version would make many more system calls to initialize libc and do dynamic linking. But this is a static executable because we linked using ld without -pie or any shared libraries; the only instructions that run in user-space are the ones you provide.
$ strace ./hello &gt; /dev/null # without a redirect, your program&#x27;s stdout is mixed with strace&#x27;s logging on stderr. Which is normally fine
execve(&quot;./hello&quot;, [&quot;./hello&quot;], 0x7ffc8b0b3570 /* 51 vars */) = 0
write(1, &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;, 13) = 13
exit(0) = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
===Using the flags register===
Flags are heavily used for comparisons in the x86 architecture. When a comparison is made between two data, the CPU sets the relevant flag or flags. Following this, conditional jump instructions can be used to check the flags and branch to code that should run, e.g.:

 cmp eax, ebx
 jne do_something
do_something:
 ; do something here

Aside, from compare instructions, there are a great many arithmetic and other instructions that set bits in the flags register. Other examples are the instructions sub, test and add and there are many more. Common combinations such as cmp + conditional jump are internally ‘fused’ (‘macro fusion’) into one single micro-instruction (μ-op) and are fast provided the processor can guess which way the conditional jump will go, jump vs continue.

The flags register are also used in the x86 architecture to turn on and off certain features or execution modes. For example, to disable all maskable interrupts, you can use the instruction:

 cli
The flags register can also be directly accessed. The low 8 bits of the flag register can be loaded into codice_131 using the codice_132 instruction. The entire flags register can also be moved on and off the stack using the instructions codice_133, codice_107, codice_128 (including codice_136) and codice_130.

The x87 floating point maths subsystem also has its own independent ‘flags’-type register the fp status word. In the 1990s it was an awkward and slow procedure to access the flag bits in this register, but on modern processors there are ‘compare two floating point values’ instructions that can be used with the normal conditional jump/branch instructions directly without any intervening steps.

===Using the instruction pointer register===
The instruction pointer is called codice_138 in 16-bit mode, codice_139 in 32-bit mode, and codice_140 in 64-bit mode. The instruction pointer register points to the address of the next instruction that the processor will attempt to execute. It cannot be directly accessed in 16-bit or 32-bit mode, but a sequence like the following can be written to put the address of codice_141 into codice_66 (32-bit code):
 call next_line
next_line:
 pop eax
Writing to the instruction pointer is simple — a codice_108 instruction stores the given target address into the instruction pointer to, so, for example, a sequence like the following will put the contents of codice_144 into codice_140 (64-bit code):
 jmp rax
In 64-bit mode, instructions can reference data relative to the instruction pointer, so there is less need to copy the value of the instruction pointer to another register.

*The tie to gold is &quot;de facto&quot; re-established in November 1922.
*The tie to gold is &quot;de jure&quot; re-established on 1 April 1924
*The tie to gold is abolished once more on 27 September 1931. Floating exchange rate.
*A tie to the British pound is introduced in June 1933. (1 GBP = 19.40 SEK)
*Tied to the US dollar on 28 August 1939. (1 USD = 4.20 SEK)
*A controlled appreciation of 14.3%, against all other currencies and gold on 13 July 1946. (1 USD = 3.60 SEK)
*A controlled depreciation of 30.5% against the USD on 19 September 1949. (1 USD = 5.17 SEK)
*Membership of the International Monetary Fund and part of the Bretton Woods system on 31 August 1951.
*A controlled depreciation of 1.0% against gold and a 7.5% appreciation against the USD on 21 December 1971.
*A controlled depreciation of 5.0% against gold and a 5.6% appreciation against the USD on 16 February 1973.
*Membership in the European &quot;currency snake&quot; in March 1973.
*Adjustment of the exchange rates within the &quot;snake&quot;; a controlled 3% depreciation against the DEM on 18 October 1976.
*Adjustment of the exchange rates within the &quot;snake&quot;; a controlled 6% depreciation against the DEM on 4 April 1977.
*Sweden leaves the &quot;snake&quot;. A controlled 10% depreciation against a trade based &quot;currency basket&quot; on 29 August 1977.
*A controlled depreciation of 10% against the &quot;currency basket&quot; on 14 September 1981.
*A controlled depreciation of 16% against the &quot;currency basket&quot; on 8 October 1982.
*A tie to the European Currency Unit is introduced unilaterally on 17 May 1991. (1 ECU = 7.40 SEK)
*Floating exchange rate on 19 November 1992.
*A Swedish euro referendum is held on 2003, with 55.9 percent vote against membership of the eurozone.

==1992==
In late 1992 (Monday 14 September) the British pound began a steep decline that made it &quot;leave&quot; the Exchange Rate Mechanism on the Wednesday of that week. At the same time the Swedish currency began to decline; the first reaction from the central bank was to try to keep the current fixed exchange rates in place, and they set a target for their equivalent to the federal funds rate (&quot;marginal rate&quot;) at 500%. The bank began to sell short-term government securities in large amounts but soon realized that market forces were strong, so they lowered their target rate, and let everyone sell what they wanted to sell, and the country saw a large selling of SEK, and SEK denominated papers. Between September 1992 and February 1993 the Swedish currency &quot;TCW&quot; index went from 125 to 100 (20% fall), while the British currency XBP index fell from 200 to 142 (29% fall).
