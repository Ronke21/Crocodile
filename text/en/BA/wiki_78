<text>Vedanta (; , ), also known as Uttara Mīmāṃsā, is one of the six orthodox (&quot;āstika&quot;) traditions of textual exegesis and Hindu philosophy. The word &quot;Vedanta&quot; means &#x27;conclusion of the Vedas&#x27;, and encompasses the ideas that emerged from, or aligned and reinterpreted, the speculations and enumerations contained in the Upanishads, focusing, with varying emphasis on devotion and knowledge, and liberation. Vedanta developed into many traditions, all of which give their specific interpretations of a common group of texts called the &quot;Prasthānatrayī&quot;, translated as &#x27;the three sources&#x27;: the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

All Vedanta traditions are exegetical in nature, but also contain extensive discussions on ontology, soteriology, and epistemology, even as there is much disagreement among the various traditions. Independently considered, they may seem completely disparate due to the pronounced differences in thoughts and reasoning.

The main traditions of Vedanta are: &quot;Bhedabheda&quot; (difference and non-difference); &quot;Advaita&quot; (non-dualism); and the Vaishnavite traditions of Dvaitadvaita (dualistic non-dualism), &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; (qualified non-dualism), &quot;Tattvavada (Dvaita)&quot; (dualism), &quot;Suddhadvaita&quot; (pure non-dualism), and Achintya-Bheda-Abheda (inconceivable difference and non-difference). Modern developments in Vedanta include Neo-Vedanta, and the philosophy of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.

Most major Vedanta schools, except Advaita Vedanta and Neo-Vedanta, are related to Vaishnavism and emphasize devotion (Bhakti) to God, understood as Vishnu or a related manifestation. Advaita Vedanta, on the other hand, emphasizes Jñana (knowledge) and Jñana Yoga over theistic devotion. While the monism of Advaita has attracted considerable attention in the West due to the influence of the 14th century Advaitin Vidyaranya and modern Hindus like Swami Vivekananda and Ramana Maharshi, most Vedanta traditions focus on Vaishnava theology.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word &quot;Vedanta&quot; is made of two words :
* Veda (वेद) — refers to the four sacred Vedic texts.
* Anta (अंत) — this word means &quot;end&quot;.

The word &quot;Vedanta&quot; literally means the &quot;end of the Vedas&quot; and originally referred to the &quot;Upanishads&quot;. Vedanta is concerned with the or knowledge section of the vedas which is called the &quot;Upanishads&quot;. The meaning of Vedanta expanded later to encompass the different philosophical traditions that interpret and explain the &quot;Prasthanatrayi&quot; in the light of their respective views on the relation between humans and the Divine or Absolute reality.

The &quot;Upanishads&quot; may be regarded as the end of &quot;Vedas&quot; in different senses:
# They were the last literary products of the Vedic period.
# They represent the pinnacle of Vedic philosophy.
# They were taught and debated last, in the &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; (student) stage.

Vedanta is one of the six orthodox (&quot;āstika&quot;) traditions of textual exegesis and Indian philosophy. It is also called &quot;Uttara Mīmāṃsā&quot;, which means the &quot;latter enquiry&quot; or &quot;higher enquiry&quot;; and is often contrasted with &quot;Pūrva Mīmāṃsā&quot;, the &quot;former enquiry&quot; or &quot;primary enquiry&quot;. &quot;Pūrva Mīmāṃsā&quot; deals with the &quot;karmakāṇḍa&quot; or ritualistic section (the &quot;Samhita&quot; and &quot;Brahmanas&quot;) in the &quot;Vedas&quot; while &quot;Uttara Mīmāṃsā&quot; concerns itself with the deeper questions of the relation between humans and Divine or Absolute reality.

== Vedanta philosophy ==

===Common features===
Despite their differences, all traditions of Vedanta share some common features:
* Vedanta is the investigation of &quot;Brahman&quot; and &quot;Ātman&quot;.
* The various traditions give their own, specific exegesis of the &quot;Upaniṣads&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavadgītā&quot;, and the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; (known as the three canonical sources).
* Scripture (Sruti Śabda) is the main reliable source of knowledge (&quot;pramana&quot;).
* &quot;Brahman&quot; - &quot;Īśvara&quot; (God), exists as the unchanging material cause and instrumental cause of the world. The exception is that Dvaita Vedanta does not hold Brahman to be the material cause, but only the efficient cause.
* The self (&quot;Ātman&quot; or &quot;Jīva&quot;) is the agent of its own acts (&quot;karma&quot;) and the recipient of the consequences of these actions.
* Belief in rebirth (&quot;samsara&quot;) and the desirability of release from the cycle of rebirths &quot;(moksha)&quot;.
* Rejection of Buddhism and Jainism and conclusions of the other Vedic schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, and, to some extent, the Purva Mimamsa).

=== Scripture ===
The main &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavadgītā&quot; and the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; are the foundational scriptures in Vedanta. All traditions of Vedanta give a specific exegesis of these texts, collectively called the &quot;Prasthānatrayī&quot;, literally, &quot;three sources&quot;.

# The &quot;Upanishads&quot;, or &quot;Śruti prasthāna&quot;; considered the &quot;Sruti&quot;, the &quot;heard&quot; (and repeated) foundation of Vedanta.
# The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot;, or &quot;Nyaya prasthana&quot; / &quot;Yukti prasthana&quot;; considered the reason-based foundation of Vedanta.
# The &quot;Bhagavadgītā&quot;, or &quot;Smriti prasthāna&quot;; considered the &quot;Smriti&quot; (remembered tradition) foundation of Vedanta.

All prominent Vedantic teachers, including Shankara, Bhaskara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka, and Vallabha wrote commentaries on these three sources. The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; of &quot;Badarayana&quot; serve as a bhedabheda-based synthesis of the teachings found in the diverse &quot;Upanishads&quot;, and while there may have been other similar syntheses in the past, only the Brahma Sūtras have survived to the present day. The &quot;Bhagavadgītā&quot;, with its syncretism of Samkhya, Yoga, and Upanishadic thought, has also been a significant influence on Vedantic thought.

All Vedāntins agree that scripture (śruti) is the only means of knowing (pramāṇa) regarding spiritual matters (which are beyond perception and inference). This is explained by Rāmānuja as follows:A theory that rests exclusively on human concepts may at some other time or place be refuted by arguments devised by cleverer people... The conclusion is that with regard to supernatural matters, Scripture alone is the epistemic authority and that reasoning is to be used only in support of Scripture’ [Śrī Bhāṣya 2.1.12].

For specific sub-traditions of Vedanta, other texts may be equally important. For example, for Advaita Vedanta, the works of Adi Shankara are nominally central, though other teachers were equally, or even more, influential. For the theistic Vaishnava schools of Vedanta, the &quot;Bhāgavata Purāṇa&quot; is particularly important. The &quot;Bhāgavata Purāṇa&quot; is one of the most widely commented upon works in Vedanta. This text is so central to the Krishna-centered Vedanta schools that the Vedantin theologian Vallabha added the Bhāgavata Purāṇa as a fourth text to the &quot;Prasthānatrayī&quot; (three classic scriptures of Vedanta).

===Metaphysics===
Vedanta philosophies discuss three fundamental metaphysical categories and the relations between the three.
# &quot;Brahman&quot; or &quot;Īśvara&quot;: the ultimate reality
# &quot;Ātman&quot; or &quot;Jivātman&quot;: the individual soul, self
# &quot;Prakriti&quot; &quot;or Jagat&quot;: the empirical world, ever-changing physical universe, body and matter

==== Brahman / Īśvara – Conceptions of the Supreme Reality ====
Shankara, in formulating Advaita, talks of two conceptions of &quot;Brahman&quot;:
* &quot;Parā&quot; or Higher &quot;Brahman&quot;: The undifferentiated, absolute, infinite, transcendental, supra-relational Brahman beyond all thought and speech is defined as &quot;parā&quot; &quot;Brahman&quot;, &quot;nirviśeṣa&quot; Brahman, or &quot;nirguṇa&quot; Brahman and is the Absolute of metaphysics.
* &quot;Aparā&quot; or Lower &quot;Brahman&quot;: The &quot;Brahman&quot; with qualities defined as &quot;aparā&quot; &quot;Brahman&quot; or &quot;saguṇa&quot; &quot;Brahman&quot;. The &quot;saguṇa&quot; &quot;Brahman&quot; is endowed with attributes and represents the personal God of religion.

Ramanuja, in formulating Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, rejects &quot;Nirguṇa&quot; – that the undifferentiated Absolute is inconceivable – and adopts a theistic interpretation of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, accepting &quot;Brahman&quot; as &quot;Īśvara&quot;, the personal God who is the seat of all auspicious attributes, as the One reality. The God of Vishishtadvaita is accessible to the devotee, yet remains the Absolute, with differentiated attributes.

Madhva, in expounding Dvaita philosophy, maintains that &quot;Vishnu&quot; is the supreme God, thus identifying the &quot;Brahman&quot;, or absolute reality, of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; with a personal god, as Ramanuja had done before him. Nimbarka, in his Dvaitadvata philosophy, accepted the &quot;Brahman&quot; both as &quot;nirguṇa&quot; and as &quot;saguṇa&quot;. Vallabha, in his Shuddhadvaita philosophy, not only accepts the triple ontological essence of the &quot;Brahman&quot;, but also His manifestation as personal God (&quot;Īśvara&quot;), as matter, and as individual souls.

==== Relation between Brahman and Jīva / Atman ====
The schools of Vedanta differ in their conception of the relation they see between &quot;Ātman&quot; / &quot;Jīvātman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; / &quot;Īśvara&quot;:
* According to Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), &quot;Ātman&quot; is identical with &quot;Brahman&quot; and there is no difference.
* According to Viśiṣṭādvaita (qualified non-dualism), &quot;Jīvātman&quot; is different from &quot;Īśvara&quot;, though eternally connected with Him as His mode. The oneness of the Supreme Reality is understood in the sense of an organic unity (&quot;vishistaikya&quot;). &quot;Brahman&quot;/&quot;Īśvara&quot; alone, as organically related to all &quot;Jīvātman&quot; and the material universe is the one Ultimate Reality.
* According to Dvaita (dualism), the &quot;Jīvātman&quot; is totally and always different from &quot;Brahman&quot; / &quot;Īśvara&quot;.
* According to Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism), the &quot;Jīvātman&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; are identical; both, along with the changing empirically observed universe being Krishna.

===Epistemology===
==== Pramana ====
&quot;Pramāṇa&quot; (Sanskrit: प्रमाण) literally means &quot;proof&quot;, &quot;that which is the means of valid knowledge&quot;. It refers to epistemology in Indian philosophies, and encompasses the study of reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge. The focus of Pramana is the manner in which correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows or does not know, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six &quot;pramanas&quot; as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:
# &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception)
# &quot;Anumāṇa&quot; (inference)
# &quot;Upamāṇa&quot; (comparison and analogy)
# &quot;Arthāpatti&quot; (postulation, derivation from circumstances)
# &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)
# &quot;Śabda&quot; (scriptural testimony/ verbal testimony of past or present reliable experts).
The different schools of Vedanta have historically disagreed as to which of the six are epistemologically valid. For example, while Advaita Vedanta accepts all six &quot;pramanas&quot;, Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita accept only three &quot;pramanas&quot; (perception, inference and testimony).

Advaita considers &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception) as the most reliable source of knowledge, and &quot;Śabda&quot;, the scriptural evidence, is considered secondary except for matters related to Brahman, where it is the only evidence. In Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita, &quot;Śabda&quot;, the scriptural testimony, is considered the most authentic means of knowledge instead.

==== Theory of cause and effect ====
All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of &quot;Satkāryavāda&quot;, which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are two different views on the status of the &quot;effect&quot;, that is, the world. Most schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya, support &quot;Parinamavada&quot;, the idea that the world is a real transformation (&quot;parinama&quot;) of Brahman. According to , &quot;the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins&quot;. In contrast to Badarayana, post-Shankara Advaita Vedantists hold a different view, &quot;Vivartavada&quot;, which says that the effect, the world, is merely an unreal (&quot;vivarta&quot;) transformation of its cause, Brahman.

==Overview of the main schools of Vedanta==
The &quot;Upanishads&quot; present an associative philosophical inquiry in the form of identifying various doctrines and then presenting arguments for or against them. They form the basic texts and Vedanta interprets them through rigorous philosophical exegesis to defend the point of view of their specific &quot;sampradaya&quot;. Varying interpretations of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; and their synthesis, the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, led to the development of different schools of Vedanta over time.

Vinayak Sakaram Ghate of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of the Brahma Sutra commentaries by Nimbarka, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Shankara and Madhva. In his conclusion, Ghate determined that Nimbarka&#x27;s and Ramanuja&#x27;s commentaries provide the most accurate interpretation of the Brahma Sutras, considering both the passages that emphasize unity and those that emphasize diversity. Gavin Flood suggests that although Advaita Vedanta is the most well-known school of Vedanta and is sometimes wrongly perceived as the sole representation of Vedantic thought, with Shankara being a follower of Shaivism, the true essence of Vedanta lies within the Vaisnava tradition and can be considered a discourse within the broad framework of Vaisnavism. Four Vaishnava sampradays are considered to be of special significance based on the teachings of Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha, and Nimbarka.

The number of prominent Vedanta schools varies among scholars, with some classifying them as three to six.
# &quot;Bhedabheda&quot;, as early as the 7th century CE, or even the 4th century CE. 
#* &quot;Dvaitādvaita&quot; or &quot;Svabhavikabhedabheda&quot; (Vaishnava), founded by Nimbarka and Srinivasacharya in the 7th century CE
# &quot;Advaita&quot; (monistic), many scholars of which most prominent are Gaudapada (~500 CE) and Adi Shankaracharya (8th century CE)
# &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; (Vaishnava), prominent scholars are Nathamuni, Yāmuna and Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE)
#* &quot;Akshar-Purushottam Darshan&quot;, based on the teachings of Swaminarayan (1781-1830 CE) and rooted in Ramanuja&#x27;s &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot;; propagated most notably by BAPS
# &quot;Tattvavada (Dvaita)&quot; (Vaishnava), founded by Madhvacharya (1199–1278 CE). The prominent scholars are Jayatirtha (1345-1388 CE), and Vyasatirtha (1460–1539 CE)
# &quot;Suddhadvaita&quot; (Vaishnava), founded by Vallabha (1479–1531 CE)
# &quot;Achintya Bheda Abheda&quot; (Vaishnava), founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534 CE), propagated by Gaudiya Vaishnava

===Bhedabheda Vedanta (difference and non-difference)===
Bhedābheda means &quot;difference and non-difference&quot; and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (&quot;Jīvatman&quot;) is both different and not different from &quot;Brahman&quot;. Notable figures in this school are Bhartriprapancha, Nimbārka and Srinivasa(7th century) who founded the Dvaitadvaita school, Bhāskara (8th–9th century), Ramanuja&#x27;s teacher Yādavaprakāśa, Chaitanya (1486–1534) who founded the Achintya Bheda Abheda school, and Vijñānabhikṣu (16th century).

==== Dvaitādvaita ====

Nimbārka (7th century) sometimes identified with Bhāskara, and Srinivasa propounded &quot;Dvaitādvaita&quot;. &quot;Brahman&quot; (God), souls &quot;(chit)&quot; and matter or the universe &quot;(achit)&quot; are considered as three equally real and co-eternal realities. &quot;Brahman&quot; is the controller &quot;(niyanta)&quot;, the soul is the enjoyer &quot;(bhokta)&quot;, and the material universe is the object enjoyed &quot;(bhogya)&quot;. The Brahman is &quot;Krishna&quot;, the ultimate cause who is omniscient, omnipotent, all-pervading Being. He is the efficient cause of the universe because, as Lord of &quot;Karma&quot; and internal ruler of souls, He brings about creation so that the individual souls can reap the consequences of their &quot;karma&quot;. God is considered to be the material cause of the universe because creation was a manifestation of His powers of soul &quot;(chit)&quot; and matter &quot;(achit)&quot;; creation is a transformation &quot;(parinama)&quot; of God&#x27;s powers. He can be realized only through a constant effort to merge oneself with His nature through meditation and devotion.

===Advaita Vedanta===

Advaita Vedanta (IAST &quot;&quot;; Sanskrit: (अद्वैत वेदान्त), propounded by Gaudapada (7th century) and Adi Shankara (9th century), but popularized by Vidyaranya (14th century) and 19th-20th century neo-Vedantins, espouses non-dualism and monism. &quot;Brahman&quot; is held to be the sole unchanging metaphysical reality and identical to the individual &quot;Atman&quot;. The physical world, on the other hand, is always-changing empirical &quot;Maya&quot;. The absolute and infinite &quot;Atman&quot;-&quot;Brahman&quot; is realized by a process of negating everything relative, finite, empirical and changing.

The school accepts no duality, no limited individual souls (&quot;Atman&quot; / &quot;Jīvatman&quot;), and no separate unlimited cosmic soul. All souls and their existence across space and time are considered to be the same oneness. Spiritual liberation in &quot;Advaita&quot; is the full comprehension and realization of oneness, that one&#x27;s unchanging &quot;Atman&quot; (soul) is the same as the &quot;Atman&quot; in everyone else, as well as being identical to &quot;Brahman&quot;.

===Vishishtadvaita Vedanta===
&quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot;, propounded by Ramanuja (11–12th century), asserts that &quot;Jīvatman&quot; (human souls) and &quot;Brahman&quot; (as &quot;Vishnu&quot;) are different, a difference that is never transcended. With this qualification, Ramanuja also affirmed monism by saying that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the &quot;Brahman&quot;. &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; is a qualified non-dualistic school of Vedanta and like Advaita, begins by assuming that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation. On the relation between the &quot;Brahman&quot; and the world of matter (&quot;Prakriti&quot;), &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; states both are two different absolutes, both metaphysically true and real, neither is false or illusive, and that &quot;saguna&quot; &quot;Brahman&quot; with attributes is also real. Ramanuja states that God, like man, has both soul and body, and the world of matter is the glory of God&#x27;s body. The path to &quot;Brahman&quot; (&quot;Vishnu&quot;), according to Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of the personal god (&quot;bhakti&quot; of &quot;saguna&quot; &quot;Brahman&quot;).

==== Akshar-Purushottam Darshan ====

The Swaminarayan Darshana, also called Akshar-Purushottam Darshan by the BAPS, was propounded by Swaminarayan (1781-1830 CE) and is rooted in Ramanuja&#x27;s &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot;. It asserts that Parabrahman (Purushottam, Narayana) and Aksharbrahman are two distinct eternal realities. Adherents believe that they can achieve moksha (liberation) by becoming aksharrup (or brahmarup), that is, by attaining qualities similar to Akshar (or Aksharbrahman) and worshipping Purushottam (or Parabrahman; the supreme living entity; God).

===Dvaita===
Tattvavada, propounded by Madhvacharya (13th century), is based on the premise of realism or realistic point of view. The term Dvaita, which means dualism, was later applied to Madhvacharya&#x27;s philosophy. &quot;Atman&quot; (soul) and &quot;Brahman&quot; (as &quot;Vishnu&quot;) are understood as two completely different entities. &quot;Brahman&quot; is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter. In &quot;Dvaita&quot; Vedanta, an individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and complete devotional surrender to &quot;Vishnu&quot; for salvation, and it is only His grace that leads to redemption and salvation. Madhva believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned, a view not found in &quot;Advaita&quot; and &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; Vedanta. While the &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; Vedanta asserted &quot;qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls&quot;, Madhva asserted both &quot;qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls&quot;.

===Shuddhādvaita===

Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism), propounded by Vallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), states that the entire universe is real and is subtly &quot;Brahman&quot; only in the form of &quot;Krishna&quot;. Vallabhacharya agreed with Advaita Vedanta&#x27;s ontology, but emphasized that &quot;prakriti&quot; (empirical world, body) is not separate from the &quot;Brahman&quot;, but just another manifestation of the latter. Everything, everyone, everywhere – soul and body, living and non-living, &quot;jīva&quot; and matter – is the eternal &quot;Krishna&quot;. The way to &quot;Krishna&quot;, in this school, is &quot;bhakti&quot;. Vallabha opposed renunciation of monistic &quot;sannyasa&quot; as ineffective and advocates the path of devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) rather than knowledge (&quot;jnana&quot;). The goal of &quot;bhakti&quot; is to turn away from ego, self-centered-ness and deception, and to turn towards the eternal &quot;Krishna&quot; in everything continually offering freedom from &quot;samsara&quot;.

=== Achintya-Bheda-Abheda ===

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486 – 1533) was the prime exponent of &quot;Achintya-Bheda-Abheda&quot;. In Sanskrit &quot;achintya&quot; means &#x27;inconceivable&#x27;. &quot;Achintya-Bheda-Abheda&quot; represents the philosophy of &quot;inconceivable difference in non-difference&quot;, in relation to the non-dual reality of &quot;Brahman&quot;-&quot;Atman&quot; which it calls (&quot;Krishna&quot;), &quot;svayam bhagavan&quot;. The notion of &quot;inconceivability&quot; (&quot;acintyatva&quot;) is used to reconcile apparently contradictory notions in Upanishadic teachings. This school asserts that &quot;Krishna&quot; is &quot;Bhagavan&quot; of the &quot;bhakti yogins&quot;, the &quot;Brahman&quot; of the &quot;jnana yogins&quot;, and has a divine potency that is inconceivable. He is all-pervading and thus in all parts of the universe (non-difference), yet he is inconceivably more (difference). This school is at the foundation of the &quot;Gaudiya Vaishnava&quot; religious tradition. The ISKCON or the Hare Krishnas also affiliate to this school of Vedanta Philosophy.

==History==
The history of Vedanta can be divided into two periods: one prior to the composition of the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; and the other encompassing the schools that developed after the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; were written. Until the 11th century, Vedanta was a peripheral school of thought.

===Before the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; (before the 5th century)===
Little is known of schools of Vedanta existing before the composition of the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; (first composition c. 2nd cent. BCE, final redaction 400–450 CE). It is clear that Badarayana, the writer of &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, was not the first person to systematize the teachings of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, as he quotes six Vedantic teachers before him – Ashmarathya, Badari, Audulomi, Kashakrtsna, Karsnajini and Atreya. References to other early Vedanta teachers – Brahmadatta, Sundara, Pandaya, Tanka and Dravidacharya – are found in secondary literature of later periods. The works of these ancient teachers have not survived, but based on the quotes attributed to them in later literature, Sharma postulates that Ashmarathya and Audulomi were Bhedabheda scholars, Kashakrtsna and Brahmadatta were Advaita scholars, while Tanka and Dravidacharya were either Advaita or Viśiṣṭādvaita scholars.

===&quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; (completed in the 5th century)===
Badarayana summarized and interpreted teachings of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; in the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, also called the &quot;Vedanta Sutra&quot;, possibly &quot;written from a Bhedābheda Vedāntic viewpoint.&quot; Badarayana summarized the teachings of the classical Upanishads and refuted the rival philosophical schools in ancient India like the sāṃkhya system. The Brahma Sutras laid the basis for the development of Vedanta philosophy.

Though attributed to Badarayana, the Brahma Sutras were likely composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years. The estimates on when the Brahma Sutras were complete vary, with Nakamura in 1989 and Nicholson in his 2013 review stating, that they were most likely compiled in the present form around 400–450 CE. Isaeva suggests they were complete and in current form by 200 CE, while Nakamura states that &quot;the great part of the &quot;Sutra&quot; must have been in existence much earlier than that&quot; (800 - 500 BCE).

The book is composed of four chapters, each divided into four-quarters or sections. These sutras attempt to synthesize the diverse teachings of the Upanishads. However, the cryptic nature of aphorisms of the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; have required exegetical commentaries. These commentaries have resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own commentary.

===Between the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; and Adi Shankara (5th–8th centuries)===
Little with specificity is known of the period between the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; (5th century CE) and Adi Shankara (8th century CE). Only two writings of this period have survived: the &quot;Vākyapadīya&quot;, written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century,) and the &quot;Kārikā&quot; written by Gaudapada (early 6th or 7th century CE).

Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his school in his commentaries. A number of important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the &quot;Siddhitraya&quot; by Yamunācārya (c. 1050), the &quot;Vedārthasamgraha&quot; by Rāmānuja (c. 1050–1157), and the &quot;Yatīndramatadīpikā&quot; by Śrīnivāsa Dāsa. At least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahma Sutras and Shankara&#x27;s lifetime.

A noted scholar of this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha maintained that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach the tenet of Bhedabheda. Bhedābheda means &quot;difference and non-difference&quot; and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (&quot;Jīvatman&quot;) is both different and not different from &quot;Brahman&quot;. Notable figures in this tradition are Nimbārka (7th century) who founded the Dvaitadvaita school, Bhāskara (8th–9th century), Ramanuja&#x27;s teacher Yādavaprakāśa, Chaitanya (1486–1534) who founded the Achintya Bheda Abheda school, and Vijñānabhikṣu (16th century).

===Gaudapada, Adi Shankara (Advaita Vedanta) (6th–9th centuries)===
Influenced by Buddhism, Advaita vedanta departs from the bhedabheda-philosophy, instead postulating the identity of &quot;Atman&quot; with the Whole (&quot;Brahman&quot;),

====Gaudapada====
Gaudapada (c. 6th century CE), was the teacher or a more distant predecessor of Govindapada, the teacher of Adi Shankara. Shankara is widely considered as the apostle of Advaita Vedanta. Gaudapada&#x27;s treatise, the &#x27; – also known as the &#x27; or the &quot;&quot; – is the earliest surviving complete text on Advaita Vedanta.

Gaudapada&#x27;s &#x27; relied on the Mandukya, Brihadaranyaka and Chhandogya &quot;Upanishads&quot;. In the &#x27;, Advaita (non-dualism) is established on rational grounds (&quot;upapatti&quot;) independent of scriptural revelation; its arguments are devoid of all religious, mystical or scholastic elements. Scholars are divided on a possible influence of Buddhism on Gaudapada&#x27;s philosophy. The fact that Shankara, in addition to the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, the principal &quot;Upanishads&quot; and the &quot;Bhagvad Gita&quot;, wrote an independent commentary on the &quot;&quot; proves its importance in literature.

====Adi Shankara====
Adi Shankara (c.800-c.850), elaborated on Gaudapada&#x27;s work and more ancient scholarship to write detailed commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi and the &#x27;. The Mandukya Upanishad and the &#x27; have been described by Shankara as containing &quot;the epitome of the substance of the import of Vedanta&quot;. It was Shankara who integrated Gaudapada work with the ancient &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, &quot;and give it a &quot;locus classicus&quot;&quot; alongside the realistic strain of the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;.

A noted contemporary of Shankara was Maṇḍana Miśra, who regarded Mimamsa and Vedanta as forming a single system and advocated their combination known as &quot;Karma-jnana-samuchchaya-vada&quot;. The treatise on the differences between the Vedanta school and the Mimamsa school was a contribution of Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta rejects rituals in favor of renunciation, for example.

===Early Vaishnavism Vedanta (7th–9th centuries)===
Early Vaishnava Vedanta retains the tradition of &quot;bhedabheda&quot;, equating Brahman with Vishnu or Krishna.

====Nimbārka and Dvaitādvaita====
Nimbārka (7th century) sometimes identified with Bhāskara, propounded &quot;Dvaitādvaita&quot; or Bhedābheda.

====Bhāskara and Upadhika====
Bhāskara (8th–9th century) also taught Bhedabheda. In postulating &quot;Upadhika&quot;, he considers both identity and difference to be equally real. As the causal principle, &quot;Brahman&quot; is considered non-dual and formless pure being and intelligence. The same &quot;Brahman&quot;, manifest as events, becomes the world of plurality. &quot;&quot; is &quot;Brahman&quot; limited by the mind. Matter and its limitations are considered real, not a manifestation of ignorance. Bhaskara advocated &quot;bhakti&quot; as &quot;dhyana&quot; (meditation) directed toward the transcendental &quot;Brahman&quot;. He refuted the idea of &quot;Maya&quot; and denied the possibility of liberation in bodily existence.

===Vaishnavism Bhakti Vedanta (11th–16th centuries)===

The Bhakti movement of late medieval Hinduism started in the 7th century, but rapidly expanded after the 12th century. It was supported by the Puranic literature such as the Bhagavata Purana, poetic works, as well as many scholarly bhasyas and samhitas.

This period saw the growth of Vashnavism Sampradayas (denominations or communities) under the influence of scholars such as Ramanujacharya, Vedanta Desika, Madhvacharya and Vallabhacharya. Bhakti poets or teachers such as Manavala Mamunigal, Namdev, Ramananda, Surdas, Tulsidas, Eknath, Tyagaraja, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and many others influenced the expansion of Vaishnavism. These Vaishnavism sampradaya founders challenged the then dominant Shankara&#x27;s doctrines of Advaita Vedanta, particularly Ramanuja in the 12th century, Vedanta Desika and Madhva in the 13th, building their theology on the devotional tradition of the Alvars (Shri Vaishnavas), and Vallabhacharya in the 16th century.

In North and Eastern India, Vaishnavism gave rise to various late Medieval movements: Ramananda in the 14th century, Sankaradeva in the 15th and Vallabha and Chaitanya in the 16th century.

====Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita Vedanta) (11th–12th centuries)====
Rāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was the most influential philosopher in the Viśiṣṭādvaita tradition. As the philosophical architect of Vishishtadvaita, he taught qualified non-dualism. Ramanuja&#x27;s teacher, Yadava Prakasha, followed the Advaita monastic tradition. Tradition has it that Ramanuja disagreed with Yadava and Advaita Vedanta, and instead followed Nathamuni and Yāmuna. Ramanuja reconciled the &quot;Prasthanatrayi&quot; with the theism and philosophy of the Vaishnava Alvars poet-saints. Ramanuja wrote a number of influential texts, such as a bhasya on the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, all in Sanskrit.

Ramanuja presented the epistemological and soteriological importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja&#x27;s case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Atman (souls) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman. Vishishtadvaiata provides the philosophical basis of Sri Vaishnavism.

Ramanuja was influential in integrating &quot;Bhakti&quot;, the devotional worship, into Vedanta premises.

==== Madhva (Tattvavada or Dvaita Vedanta)(13th–14th centuries) ====
Tattvavada or Dvaita Vedanta was propounded by Madhvacharya (1238–1317 CE). He presented the opposite interpretation of Shankara in his Dvaita, or dualistic system. In contrast to Shankara&#x27;s non-dualism and Ramanuja&#x27;s qualified non-dualism, he championed unqualified dualism. Madhva wrote commentaries on the chief &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the &quot;Brahma Sutra&quot;.

Madhva started his Vedic studies at age seven, joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat), studied under guru Achyutrapreksha, frequently disagreed with him, left the Advaita monastery, and founded Dvaita. Madhva and his followers Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha, were critical of all competing Hindu philosophies, Jainism and Buddhism, but particularly intense in their criticism of Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara.

Dvaita Vedanta is theistic and it identifies Brahman with Narayana, or more specifically Vishnu, in a manner similar to Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. But it is more explicitly pluralistic. Madhva&#x27;s emphasis for difference between soul and Brahman was so pronounced that he taught there were differences (1) between material things; (2) between material things and souls; (3) between material things and God; (4) between souls; and (5) between souls and God. He also advocated for a difference in degrees in the possession of knowledge. He also advocated for differences in the enjoyment of bliss even in the case of liberated souls, a doctrine found in no other system of Indian philosophy.

====Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (Achintya Bheda Abheda) (16th century)====

&quot;Achintya Bheda Abheda&quot; (Vaishnava), founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534 CE), was propagated by Gaudiya Vaishnava. Historically, it was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who founded congregational chanting of holy names of Krishna in the early 16th century after becoming a sannyasi.

===Modern times (19th century – present)===

==== Swaminarayan and Akshar-Purushottam Darshan (19th century) ====
The Swaminarayan Darshana, which is rooted in Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita, was founded in 1801 by Swaminarayan (1781-1830 CE), and is contemporarily most notably propagated by BAPS. Due to the commentarial work of Bhadreshdas Swami, the Akshar-Purushottam teachings were recognized as a distinct school of Vedanta by the &quot;Shri Kashi Vidvat Parishad&quot; in 2017 and by members of the 17th World Sanskrit Conference in 2018. Swami Paramtattvadas describes the Akshar-Purushottam teachings as &quot;a distinct school of thought within the larger expanse of classical Vedanta,&quot; presenting the Akshar-Purushottam teachings as a seventh school of Vedanta.

====Neo-Vedanta (19th century)====
Neo-Vedanta, variously called as &quot;Hindu modernism&quot;, &quot;neo-Hinduism&quot;, and &quot;neo-Advaita&quot;, is a term that denotes some novel interpretations of Hinduism that developed in the 19th century, presumably as a reaction to the colonial British rule. writes that these notions accorded the Hindu nationalists an opportunity to attempt the construction of a nationalist ideology to help unite the Hindus to fight colonial oppression. Western orientalists, in their search for its &quot;essence&quot;, attempted to formulate a notion of &quot;Hinduism&quot; based on a single interpretation of Vedanta as a unified body of religious praxis. This was contra-factual as, historically, Hinduism and Vedanta had always accepted a diversity of traditions. asserts that the neo-Vedantic theory of &quot;overarching tolerance and acceptance&quot; was used by the Hindu reformers, together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, to challenge the polemic dogmatism of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic missionaries against the Hindus.

The neo-Vedantins argued that the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy were perspectives on a single truth, all valid and complementary to each other. sees these interpretations as incorporating western ideas into traditional systems, especially Advaita Vedanta. It is the modern form of Advaita Vedanta, states , the neo-Vedantists subsumed the Buddhist philosophies as part of the Vedanta tradition and then argued that all the world religions are same &quot;non-dualistic position as the philosophia perennis&quot;, ignoring the differences within and outside of Hinduism. According to , neo-Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta which accepts universal realism:

A major proponent in the popularization of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was Vivekananda, who played a major role in the revival of Hinduism. He was also instrumental in the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the Vedanta Society, the international arm of the Ramakrishna Order.

===== Criticism of Neo-Vedanta label =====
 writes that the attempts at integration which came to be known as neo-Vedanta were evident as early as between the 12th and the 16th century− 

Matilal criticizes Neo-Hinduism as an oddity developed by West-inspired Western Indologists and attributes it to the flawed Western perception of Hinduism in modern India. In his scathing criticism of this school of reasoning, says:

==Influence==
According to , the Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism:
Frithjof Schuon summarizes the influence of Vedanta on Hinduism as follows:
Gavin Flood states,
=== Hindu traditions ===
Vedanta, adopting ideas from other orthodox (&quot;āstika&quot;) schools, became the most prominent school of Hinduism. Vedanta traditions led to the development of many traditions in Hinduism. Sri Vaishnavism of south and southeastern India is based on Ramanuja&#x27;s &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot; Vedanta. Ramananda led to the &quot;Vaishnav Bhakti&quot; Movement in north, east, central and west India. This movement draws its philosophical and theistic basis from &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot;. A large number of devotional &quot;Vaishnavism&quot; traditions of east India, north India (particularly the Braj region), west and central India are based on various sub-schools of &quot;Bhedabheda&quot; Vedanta. &quot;Advaita&quot; Vedanta influenced &quot;Krishna Vaishnavism&quot; in the northeastern state of Assam. The Madhva school of Vaishnavism found in coastal Karnataka is based on &quot;Dvaita&quot; Vedanta.

&quot;Āgamas&quot;, the classical literature of &quot;Shaivism&quot;, though independent in origin, show Vedanta association and premises. Of the 92 &quot;Āgamas&quot;, ten are (&quot;dvaita&quot;) texts, eighteen (&quot;bhedabheda&quot;), and sixty-four (&quot;advaita&quot;) texts. While the &quot;Bhairava Shastras&quot; are monistic, &quot;Shiva Shastras&quot; are dualistic. finds the link between Gaudapada&#x27;s &quot;Advaita&quot; Vedanta and &quot;Kashmir Shaivism&quot; evident and natural. Tirumular, the Tamil &quot;Shaiva Siddhanta&quot; scholar, credited with creating &quot;Vedanta–Siddhanta&quot; (Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva Siddhanta synthesis), stated, &quot;becoming &quot;Shiva&quot; is the goal of Vedanta and &quot;Siddhanta&quot;; all other goals are secondary to it and are vain.&quot;

&quot;Shaktism&quot;, or traditions where a goddess is considered identical to &quot;Brahman&quot;, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of &quot;Advaita&quot; Vedanta and dualism premises of &quot;Samkhya–Yoga&quot; school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as &quot;Shaktadavaitavada&quot; (literally, the path of nondualistic &quot;Shakti&quot;).

=== Influence on Western thinkers ===
An exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia since the late 18th century as a result of colonization of parts of Asia by Western powers. This also influenced western religiosity. The first translation of &quot;Upanishads&quot;, published in two parts in 1801 and 1802, significantly influenced Arthur Schopenhauer, who called them the consolation of his life. He drew explicit parallels between his philosophy, as set out in &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, and that of the Vedanta philosophy as described in the work of Sir William Jones. Early translations also appeared in other European languages. Influenced by Śaṅkara&#x27;s concepts of &quot;Brahman&quot; (God) and &quot;māyā&quot; (illusion), Lucian Blaga often used the concepts &quot;marele anonim&quot; (the Great Anonymous) and &quot;cenzura transcendentă&quot; (the transcendental censorship) in his philosophy.

Paul Deussen, influenced by Schopenhauer, elevated Indian philosophy, particularly Advaita Vedanta, within German idealism and Indology. His works, including those on history of philosophy and Upanishad translations, portrayed Vedanta as the core of Indian thought, shaping 20th century scholarship. Deussen upheld Advaita as the original truth and acknowledged variations like Visistadvaita and Dvaita. He proposed a six-stage regression model tracing philosophy&#x27;s decline from monistic idealism to realism and theism, paralleling Indian and Greek traditions.

====Similarities with Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy====
German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker was among the early scholars to notice similarities between the religious conceptions of the Vedanta and those of the Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza, writing that Spinoza&#x27;s thought was

Max Müller noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying,

Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, also compared Spinoza&#x27;s religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay,

<doc id="223391" wikidata="Q1892842" url="?curid=223391" title="Thomas Hutchinson (governor)">
<text>Thomas Hutchinson (9 September 1711 – 3 June 1780) was an American merchant, politician, historian, and colonial administrator who repeatedly served as governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the years leading up to the American Revolution. He has been described as &quot;the most important figure on the loyalist side in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts&quot;. Hutchinson was a successful merchant and politician who was active at high levels of the Massachusetts colonial government for many years, serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774. He was a politically polarizing figure who came to be identified by John Adams and Samuel Adams as a supporter of unpopular British taxes, despite his initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies. Hutchinson was blamed by British Prime Minister Lord North for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.

Hutchinson&#x27;s Boston mansion was ransacked in 1765 during protests against the Stamp Act, damaging his collection of materials on the history of Massachusetts. As acting governor in 1770, he personally visited the aftermath of the Boston Massacre, an event after which he ordered the removal of British occupational troops from Boston to Castle William. Letters of his calling for the abridgment of colonial rights were published in 1773, further intensifying opposition towards him in the colony. Hutchinson was replaced as governor in May 1774 by General Thomas Gage and went into exile in England, where he advised the British government on its dealings with the colonists.

He had a deep interest in the colonial history of the United States, collecting many historical documents. Hutchinson wrote a three-volume &quot;History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay&quot; whose last volume, published posthumously, covered his own period in office. Historian Bernard Bailyn wrote of Hutchinson, &quot;If there was one person in America whose actions might have altered the outcome [of the protests and disputes preceding the American Revolutionary War], it was he.&quot; Scholars use Hutchinson&#x27;s career to represent the tragic fate of the many Loyalists marginalized by their attachment to the British imperial system at a time when the American nation-state was emerging. He exemplified the difficulties experienced by Loyalists, paralyzed by his ideology and his dual loyalties to America and Britain. Hutchinson sacrificed his love for Massachusetts for his loyalty to Great Britain, where he spent his last years in an unhappy exile.

==Early life==
Thomas Hutchinson was born on 9 September 1711 in the North End of Boston, the fourth of twelve children of Thomas and Sarah Foster Hutchinson. He was descended from early New England settlers, including Anne Hutchinson and her son Edward Hutchinson, and his parents were both from well-to-do merchant families. His father was involved in the family mercantile trade but was also active in political, military, and charitable circles and served on the provincial council. His younger brother was Foster Hutchinson.
Young Thomas entered Harvard College at twelve, graduating in 1727. His father introduced him to the business world early, and he displayed remarkable business acumen. According to the autobiographical sketch of his childhood, Hutchinson turned a modest gift from his father of &quot;five quintals of fish&quot; into between £400 and £500 by the time he was 21. In 1732, he received some exposure to politics when he accompanied Governor Jonathan Belcher on a voyage to Casco Bay for negotiations with the Abenaki of Maine, then part of Massachusetts. The voyage was made in a vessel of which Hutchinson was part owner.

In 1734, he married Margaret Sanford, a granddaughter of Rhode Island Governor Peleg Sanford. The Sanford and Hutchinson families had a long history of business and personal connections; Margaret, in fact, was his third cousin.
The marriage secured a political alliance between Hutchinson and Andrew and Peter Oliver which lasted long after Margaret&#x27;s death. Margaret Sanford&#x27;s sister Mary (1713-1773) was the second wife of Andrew Oliver. Likewise, a daughter of Thomas Hutchinson married a son of Peter Oliver. The Oliver brothers were also related to Massachusetts governor Jonathan Belcher and to New Hampshire lieutenant governors William Partridge and George Vaughan (Harvard Class of 1696). The couple had twelve children, only five of whom survived to adulthood before Margaret died in 1754 from complications of childbirth.

==Legislator and councillor==
In 1737 Hutchinson entered politics, being elected as a Boston selectman, and later in the year, to a seat in the General Court (the provincial assembly).
He spoke out against the province&#x27;s practice of issuing bills of credit (as a form of paper currency), whose inflationary drop in value wrought havoc in the economy. This position was unpopular with the populist party in the province, and Hutchinson was voted out in the 1739 election.
He was sent to England as an agent to plead on behalf of property owners affected by King George II&#x27;s decision concerning the boundary line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire which significantly favored New Hampshire. Hutchinson&#x27;s embassy was unsuccessful, although he returned with a bequest to Harvard for the construction of a new chapel; Holden Chapel, built with these funds, still stands today.
In 1742, Hutchinson was again elected to the General Court, where he served until 1749, being the body&#x27;s speaker from 1746 to 1749.
His continued advocacy of currency reforms so annoyed the populist faction that the need to guard his properties in Boston and Milton from possible mob action was discussed.
When the British government was convinced to refund the province&#x27;s expense for mounting the 1745 Louisbourg expedition, Hutchinson seized upon the idea of using the massive payment (about £180,000 in gold and silver) to retire the province&#x27;s paper currency. Despite significant opposition, Hutchinson successfully navigated a bill implementing the idea through the assembly&#x27;s general court in 1749; it received the agreement of the Governor&#x27;s Council, and also the signature of Governor William Shirley. Many of the bill&#x27;s opponents were pleasantly surprised when the exchange of paper for specie did not cause any financial shocks, and Hutchinson&#x27;s popularity soared.

Despite the success, Hutchinson was voted out of the assembly in 1749. He was, however, immediately appointed to the Governor&#x27;s Council.
In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the District of Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts, and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1752 he was appointed judge of probate and a justice of the Common Pleas. Following the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, he was a delegate to the Albany Convention. In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions, working with Benjamin Franklin to draft a plan for colonial union. Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies and that decisive action must be taken to knit the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole. Most important, the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish &quot;a Union of His Majesty&#x27;s several governments on the continent, that so their councils, treasure, and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy&quot;.

Hutchinson&#x27;s wife died quite suddenly in 1754; Hutchinson thereafter threw himself into his work. His work was not entirely of a political nature: in a humanitarian streak he supported Acadian refugees who had been expelled from their Nova Scotia homelands, even though this support of Roman Catholics did not gain him friends in Protestant Massachusetts. He was also sensitive to the needs of the military men involved in the war, often giving aid to needy families of veterans.

==Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts==

When Governor Shirley&#x27;s political opponents engineered his recall in 1756, Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader Lord Loudoun to succeed Shirley as governor. During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips. Hutchinson&#x27;s application was unsuccessful, but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758, serving under Thomas Pownall. Hutchinson&#x27;s relationship with Pownall was awkward, for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley, under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence. Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters, sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he (Hutchinson) had earlier supported. This Hutchinson refused to do since he saw these actions as harming the province&#x27;s stability and taking place at &quot;the caprice of the governor&quot;.
Pownall, whose mistrust of Hutchinson was reciprocated, requested to leave to return to England in late 1759. The political opposition of Shirley supporters and the death of some of his leading populist supporters may have contributed to this decision. He departed the province on 3 June 1760, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor. Several months later Pownall&#x27;s replacement, Francis Bernard, arrived to take the reins of power.

===Writs of assistance===
One of Bernard&#x27;s early acts as Governor was the appointment of Hutchinson instead of James Otis Sr., as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature. This action by itself turned the province&#x27;s populists, whose vocal leaders included Otis and his son James Jr., against both Hutchinson and Bernard, with long term consequences to Hutchinson&#x27;s reputation. Hutchinson, with no legal training, had not sought the post, and some emerging legal thinkers, notably a rising young lawyer named John Adams, were also outraged.

In 1761 Hutchinson brought upon himself a storm of protest and criticism by issuing writs of assistance, documents that authorized essentially arbitrary searches by customs officials. Although some had been issued (ironically over Hutchinson&#x27;s objections) in earlier years, the writs he authorized were in some cases renewals of existing writs necessitated by the accession of King George III to the throne. Adams and the Otises seized on the issue to rail against Hutchinson&#x27;s monopolization of power (since he was also a lieutenant governor and sat on the council) and lack of legal qualifications for the post of chief justice.

===Taxes and the Stamp Act===

When the Sugar Act was being discussed in Parliament in 1763, proposals were put forward to send Hutchinson to England to represent the colony&#x27;s opposition to the proposal. Governor Bernard, however, objected to sending the sitting lieutenant governor, and subsequently the bill was enacted. Much colonial protest followed, and Hutchinson agreed with vocal opponents like the Otises (who around this time began using the phrase &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;) that the law harmed the Massachusetts economy.

In the ensuing debates, differences emerged between Hutchinson and others over Parliament&#x27;s supremacy over the North American colonies and the feasibility of Parliament having formal colonial representation overseas. These differences were exacerbated by the personal animosity that had developed between Hutchinson and the Otises. Led by James Otis, Jr. and Oxenbridge Thacher, the anti-Parliament faction seized on every minor dispute to rail against Hutchinson and his faction&#x27;s monopolization of power. Hutchinson was at first dismissive of these ongoing political attacks, believing that his opponents were either misguided or misled. Biographer Andrew Walmsley observes that Hutchinson at this stage seriously underestimated the impact of these attacks in building a coherent opposition to crown control, and in the damage it was doing to his own reputation.

In debates leading up to the passage of the 1765 Stamp Act, both Hutchinson and Bernard quietly warned London not to proceed. Hutchinson in particular wrote that &quot;It cannot be good to tax the Americans ... You will lose more than you gain.&quot;
Hutchinson&#x27;s letters even shaped the political discourse in Parliament. Isaac Barre, a prominent Member of Parliament, drew heavily on the themes presented in Hutchinson&#x27;s letters: he proclaimed that &quot;Your oppressions planted them. . . . They grew by your neglect. . . . They have nobly taken up arms in your defense&quot; on the floor of Parliament in opposition to the Stamp Act. When the Massachusetts assembly met to draft a petition to London on the matter in October 1764, Hutchinson opposed the inclusion of the radicals&#x27; language, and eventually pushed through a more moderate statement of opposition. However, the Massachusetts petition was seen as weak in comparison to those prepared by other colonies, and Hutchinson was claimed to be secretly seeking to promote the Stamp Act. He was also accused of &quot;treachery&quot; and &quot;betraying his country&quot;.
News of the act&#x27;s passage propelled one of the most vocal opponents of Parliamentary supremacy, Samuel Adams, into a larger role in provincial politics. Hutchinson privately supported calls for its repeal, but his unwillingness to publicly oppose the act merely provided additional fuel for his opponents.

===1765 Colonist violence===

Hutchinson&#x27;s brother-in-law, colonial secretary Andrew Oliver, was given the job of &quot;stamp master&quot;, with responsibility for implementing the Stamp Act in the province. Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment, his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity.
His attempts to explain his position only fueled the opposition, who recounted his early unpopular acts and questioned his motives in those deeds.
On 13 August 1765, angry colonists descended on Oliver&#x27;s home and office, ransacking both. The next night Hutchinson&#x27;s Boston mansion was surrounded, and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favor of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London. He refused, and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night.

Twelve days later, on the evening of 26 August, the colonists again formed outside of his mansion, and this time they would not be denied. Described by one architectural historian as &quot;the first developed example of provincial Palladianism in New England,&quot; the house was broken into (Hutchinson and his family narrowly escaping) and systematically ransacked. The house finishings (wainscoting and other decorative woodwork) were effectively destroyed, and even the building&#x27;s cupola was taken down in violence that lasted the entire night. The family silver, furniture, and other items were stolen or destroyed (although some items were eventually returned), and Hutchinson&#x27;s collection of historically important manuscripts was scattered. Hutchinson was then working on the final volume of his three-volume history of the Massachusetts Bay colony. Many pages of the work were lost that night and had to be recreated.
Hutchinson&#x27;s detailed inventory (reprinted by biographer James Kendall Hosmer) valued the damage done at more than £2,200, and he eventually received over £3,100 from the province for his troubles.
Hutchinson and his family temporarily took refuge at Castle William, and thereafter took up primary residence at Hutchinson&#x27;s estate in Milton.

==Governor of Massachusetts==

Because of the controversy over the Stamp Act, the radical faction came to control both the assembly and the governor&#x27;s council in 1766, and Hutchinson was denied a seat on the governor&#x27;s council.
Amid increased furor after the passage of the 1767 Townshend Acts, Governor Bernard requested and received British Army troops to protect crown officials. Letters written by Bernard describing conditions in the province were acquired by the radical opposition and published, leading to his recall. Bernard left for England on 1 August 1769, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.

Hutchinson was unsuccessful in his attempts to distance himself from the unpopular Bernard administration, and he continued to be attacked in the assembly and the local press. Despite this, he continued to lobby for a formal appointment as governor. He categorically refused to again serve as lieutenant governor under another governor, preferring instead a posting elsewhere, or to resign the lieutenant governorship.

Hutchinson was still acting governor when protests over the Townshend Acts erupted into the Boston Massacre on 5 March 1770, when nine British soldiers fired into a crowd of hundreds of Bostonians who were harassing them verbally and physically, killing five people.
Hutchinson went to the scene in the aftermath of the shooting and promised that justice would be applied fairly. He had all of the soldiers involved in the incident arrested the next day, but ongoing unrest in the city compelled him to request the withdrawal of British troops from the city into Castle William.
Hutchinson was able to postpone the trial for almost 6 months to allow anger to settle and for Adams to prepare a solid case. The soldiers involved were eventually tried, and two were convicted of manslaughter, although their sentences were reduced. The episode shook Hutchinson&#x27;s confidence in his ability to manage affairs in the province, and he penned a resignation letter.

===Appointment to Governor===
Former governor Bernard had, in the meantime, taken up Hutchinson&#x27;s cause in London. In March 1771 Hutchinson&#x27;s commission as governor arrived in Boston, having been approved by the king while Hutchinson&#x27;s resignation letter was going the other way. (Colonial Secretary Lord Hillsborough rejected his resignation.)
The instructions sent with the commission were fairly strict and left Hutchinson&#x27;s relatively little room to maneuver politically. Instructions that particularly galled Samuel Adams included one restricting the meetings of the governor&#x27;s council, and another limiting the appointment of colonial agents to individuals having the governor&#x27;s approval.

===Questions of Colonial Autonomy===
One of Hutchinson&#x27;s instructions was to relocate the provincial assembly from Boston to Cambridge, where it would be less under the influence of radical Boston politics. This demand, accomplished by executive order, resulted in howls of complaint of gubernatorial arbitrariness in the assembly. An exchange of arguments, rebuttals, and counterarguments between Hutchinson and the assembly ran for thousands of pages and lasted until 1772.

The objections to the relocation furthered the radical cause. Radical objectors painted Hutchinson&#x27;s action as a bold and devious attempt to further the executive prerogative.
The radicals were further outraged when Hutchinson announced in 1772 that his salary, which had previously been subject to appropriation by the assembly, would be paid by the crown instead. This was seen by the radicals as a further usurpation of power that rightfully belonged in the province.
Written debates further questioned the role of Parliament in governing the policies of the North American colonies, and further deepened the divide between the Massachusetts assembly and Hutchinson. Observers in the other colonies and in England noted that Hutchinson&#x27;s arguments had effectively driven moderates in the province to join with the political hardliners.

===Letters affair===
The Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in 1772 when Hutchinson, in a speech to the assembly, argued that either the colony was wholly subject to Parliament, or that it was effectively independent. The assembly&#x27;s response, authored by John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Joseph Hawley, countered that the colonial charter granted autonomy.
In England, the colonial secretary Lord Dartmouth insisted to colonial agent Benjamin Franklin that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response. Franklin had acquired a packet of letters, written in the late 1760s by Hutchinson and other colonial officials, from which he concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament. Believing that wider knowledge of these letters would focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters, Franklin sent the letters to Thomas Cushing, the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.
He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated, because he was not &quot;at liberty to make the letters public&quot;.
The letters came into the hands of Samuel Adams, then serving as the clerk of the assembly, who engineered their publication in June 1773.
Franklin&#x27;s belief was only partially vindicated: the publication of the letters unleashed a torrent of vitriol against Hutchinson, but did nothing to lessen opposition to Parliamentary policy: instead the opposition saw the letters as confirmation of a conspiracy against their rights.
The letters were reprinted throughout the colonies, and Hutchinson was burned in effigy in places as far away as Philadelphia during the uproar.

Hutchinson&#x27;s letters, written between 1767 and 1769 to Thomas Whately, a retired former leading member of the British government, included the observation that colonists couldn&#x27;t have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an &quot;abridgment of what are called English liberties&quot;.
He made no specific proposals on &quot;how&quot; the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, &quot;I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event.&quot;
Letters by Andrew Oliver, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor&#x27;s council, whose members were then elected by the assembly with the governor&#x27;s consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.

Although much of what Hutchinson wrote in the letters was not particularly new, Samuel Adams masterfully manipulated the contents and implications of some of the statements by Hutchinson and Oliver to suggest they were conspiring with officials in London to deprive the colonists of their rights.
Hutchinson was defended in print by provincial attorney general Jonathan Sewall, who claimed that Hutchinson was not actually expressing desired changes in the state of affairs but ruminating instead on possible consequences of present conditions.

The Massachusetts assembly drafted a petition to the Board of Trade demanding Hutchinson&#x27;s removal from office, and Hutchinson, concerned with the effect the letter publication and the assembly petition would have in London, requested permission to come to England to defend himself.
The letter authorizing his return did not reach Boston until November 1773, too late for him to depart that year; his request and the assembly&#x27;s petition would not be heard until early 1774.

===Tea Party===

In the meantime, Parliament had repealed most of the Townshend taxes (keeping only the one on tea), and passed the Tea Act, which authorized the British East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies, eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea. This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organize opposition to the deliveries of the company&#x27;s tea. In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis since duties were to be paid on dutiable cargo within twenty days of a ship&#x27;s arrival. Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea, although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role in the choice of the consignee. Other cargo was unloaded from the ships, but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed. Hutchinson took a hard line, refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbor despite citywide protests that the tea is sent back to England, and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed. When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December, protestors (some in Indian disguise) boarded the ships that night, and dumped the tea into the harbor.

Hutchinson justified the hardline stance that contributed to the crisis by claiming it was his duty as governor to uphold the revenue laws, while American opponents such as James Bowdoin observed that he could have just as easily refused to accept the tea when it was clear that popular sentiment would make it impossible to land the tea. British critics complained that he should have asked the British troops in Boston to intervene. After it became known that other tea ships sent to North America had turned back, Hutchinson continued to justify his actions in letters to England, anticipating hearings on the matter once he arrived there.

When the Board of Trade met to consider the assembly&#x27;s petition to recall Hutchinson, it also discussed the tea party. Franklin, as colonial agent, was forced to listen to a barrage of criticism and was dismissed as colonial postmaster general. The assembly&#x27;s petition was dismissed as &quot;groundless&quot; and &quot;vexatious&quot;, but Hutchinson&#x27;s request for leave was granted. In May 1774 General Thomas Gage arrived in Boston to take over as governor, and to implement the &quot;Coercive Acts&quot; Parliament had passed as punishment for the tea party. Hutchinson, believing he would only be away from Massachusetts temporarily, sailed for England on 1 June 1774.

==Exile==

Upon his arrival in London, Hutchinson was granted an audience with the King, who questioned him on affairs in North America, and he was well received by Rockingham, Dartmouth, and Lord North, the prime minister. In his interview with North he expressed dismay at the terms of the Massachusetts Government Act and sought to establish a basis for the eventual repeal of the Boston Port Act, whose enactment by Governor Gage had a crippling effect on the province&#x27;s economy. One part of the Government Act, the appointment by the crown of the governor&#x27;s council, was something he had long opposed without formal hearings on the matter, but even colonial authorities sympathetic to his view believed events had by 1774 gone too far for the British political establishment to support alternatives. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775 his Milton mansion was seized for use as an army barracks, and a trunk containing copies of much of his correspondence fell into rebel hands.

After publication of the Declaration of Independence in America in July 1776, Huchinson published anonymously in London the following November a point-by-point rebuttal called Strictures Upon the Declaration, defending King George III. Hutchinson&#x27;s argument was that the Declaration was a series of &quot;wilful misrepresentations,&quot; &quot;imaginary grievances,&quot; and &quot;brutal insults&quot; as incitements to rebellion; further, that &quot;if no taxes or duties had been laid upon the colonies, other pretences would have been found for exception to the authority of Parliament.&quot;

As the war progressed, Hutchinson was criticized by the Whigs in Parliament. He continued to be treated favorably by the King, but was compelled to refuse the offer of a baronetcy because most of his fortune was lost due to his exile, and he became marginalized from power as the prosecution of the war took center stage. On 4 July 1776, Hutchinson was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Oxford University.

His enemies in Massachusetts continued to attack his reputation, and his exile made it impossible to effectively dispute the charges they made. His properties, like those of other exiled Loyalists, were seized and sold off by the state; his Milton home was eventually purchased by James and Mercy Otis Warren (the latter being the sister of his long-time enemy James Otis, Jr.)

Bitter and disillusioned about his forced exile, and grieving the loss of his daughter Peggy in 1777, Hutchinson continued to work on his history of the colony which was the fruit of many decades of research. Two volumes were published in his lifetime: Volume 1 of the &quot;History of Massachusetts&quot; appeared in 1764, and Volume 2 in 1767. The third volume would be published posthumously, and included his own tenure as lieutenant governor and governor. At the same time, he worked to complete a history of the Hutchinson family, in which he encapsulated details on political affairs not found elsewhere. He suffered a stroke and died at Brompton in west London on 3 June 1780, aged 68, and was buried in Croydon Minster in south London.

==Legacy and memory==
During and after the Revolution as an unrepentant Loyalist Hutchinson was often considered a traitor to his native Massachusetts and the cause of freedom. John Adams was characteristically harsh in his assessment of him, calling him &quot;avaricious&quot; and describing him as a &quot;courtier&quot; who manipulated those at higher levels of power to achieve his aims. He was also criticized by British political figures: Thomas Pownall continued to disagree with Hutchinson after the latter&#x27;s exile, Francis Bernard (despite working on Hutchinson&#x27;s behalf) disapproved of some of his actions, and Lord North believed the publication of his letters to be responsible for the outbreak of the war.

Biographers in the 20th century have, however, rehabilitated his reputation, seeking to explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way. In recent decades historians have typically portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts. Barbara Tuchman, for example, portrays Hutchinson as an &quot;ill-fated&quot; and &quot;tragic figure&quot;. British scholar David Kenneth Fieldhouse says his tragedy emerged because he was &quot;a victim of the clash of two ideologies, his own archaic and static, that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic&quot;. Carl L. Becker, a prominent American historian wrote: &quot;Nothing would have pleased him [Hutchinson] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the goodwill of the King. His irritation with America in general and Boston, in particular, was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places.&quot; Bailyn has changed his own interpretation over the years. In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist. By 2004 he portrayed Hutchinson as a premodern thinker locked in an old mindset at a time when Enlightenment ideas were taking hold thanks to thinkers such as Adam Smith and Tom Paine.

Remnants of Hutchinson&#x27;s country estate in Milton have been preserved. The main piece, a parcel of land known as Governor Hutchinson&#x27;s Field, is owned by The Trustees of the Reservations and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is open to the public, and nearby property features a ha-ha constructed for Hutchinson in 1771. The ha-ha is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and both properties are part of the Milton Hill Historic District. Boston, which had landmarks named after the Hutchinson family, took pains upon his departure to rename them.

<text>Audouin&#x27;s gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) is a large gull restricted to the Mediterranean and the western coast of Saharan Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;ikhthus&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, and &quot;aetos&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;, and 
the specific &quot;audouinii&quot; and the English name are after the French naturalist Jean Victoire Audouin.

It breeds on small islands colonially or alone, laying 2–3 eggs on a ground nest. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;.

In the late 1960s, this was one of the world&#x27;s rarest gulls, with a population of only 1,000 pairs. It has established new colonies, but remains rare with a population of about 10,000 pairs.

This species, unlike many large gulls, rarely scavenges, but is a specialist fish eater, and is therefore strictly coastal and pelagic. This bird will feed at night, often well out to sea, but also slowly patrols close into beaches, occasionally dangling its legs to increase drag.

The adult basically resembles a small European herring gull, the most noticeable differences being the short stubby red bill and &quot;string of pearls&quot; white wing primary tips, rather than the large &quot;mirrors&quot; of some other species. The legs are grey-green. It takes four years to reach adult plumage.

This species shows little tendency to wander from its breeding areas, but there were single records in the Netherlands and England in May 2003, and one spent from December 2016 to April 2017 in Trinidad.

Audouin&#x27;s gull is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<text>Laridae is a family of seabirds in the order Charadriiformes that includes the gulls, terns (including white terns), noddies, and skimmers. It includes around 100 species arranged into 22 genera. They are an adaptable group of mostly aerial birds found worldwide.

==Taxonomy==
The family Laridae was introduced (as Laridia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. Historically, Laridae were restricted to the gulls, while the terns were placed in a separate family, Sternidae, and the skimmers in a third family, Rynchopidae. The noddies were traditionally included in Sternidae. In 1990 Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist included auks and skuas in a broader family Laridae.

A molecular phylogenetic study by Baker and colleagues published in 2007 found that the noddies in the genus &quot;Anous&quot; formed a sister group to a clade containing the gulls, skimmers, and the other terns. To create a monophyletic family group, Laridae was expanded to include the genera that had previously been in Sternidae and Rynchopidae.

Baker and colleagues found that the Laridae lineage diverged from a lineage that gave rise to both the skuas (Stercorariidae) and auks (Alcidae) before the end of the Cretaceous in the age of dinosaurs. They also found that the Laridae themselves began expanding in the early Paleocene, around 60 million years ago. The German palaeontologist Gerald Mayr has questioned the validity of these early dates and suggested that inappropriate fossils were used in calibrating the molecular data. The earliest charadriiform fossils date only from the late Eocene, around 35 million years ago.

Anders Ödeen and colleagues investigated the development of ultraviolet vision in shorebirds, by looking for the SWS1 opsin gene in various species; as gulls were the only shorebirds known to have developed the trait. They discovered that the gene was present in the gull, skimmer, and noddy lineages but not the tern lineage. They also recovered the noddies as an early lineage, though the evidence was not strong.

==Cladogram==
Part of the cladogram of the genera in the order Charadriiformes based on the analysis by Baker and colleagues published in 2007.
==Distribution and habitat==

The Laridae have spread around the world, and their adaptability has likely been a factor. Most have become much more aerial than their ancestor, which was likely some form of shorebird.

<doc id="223397" wikidata="Q1887740" url="?curid=223397" title="Larus">
<text>Larus is a large genus of gulls with worldwide distribution (by far the greatest species diversity is in the Northern Hemisphere).

Many of its species are abundant and well-known birds in their ranges. Until about 2005–2007, most gulls were placed in this genus, but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of the genera &quot;Chroicocephalus&quot;, &quot;Ichthyaetus&quot;, &quot;Hydrocoloeus&quot;, and &quot;Leucophaeus&quot; for many other species formerly included in &quot;Larus&quot;.

They are in general medium-large birds, typically pale grey to black above and white below and on the head, often with black markings with white spots (&quot;mirrors&quot;) on their wingtips and in a few species also some black on the tail. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet; in winter, the head is often streaked or smudged dark grey. The young birds are brown, and take three to five years to reach adult plumage, with subadult plumages intermediate between the young and adult.

The taxonomy of the large gulls in the herring and lesser black-backed complex is complicated, with different authorities recognising from two species in the past, increasingly up to eight species more recently.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Larus&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;laros&quot; (λάῥος) or Latin &quot;larus&quot;, which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. 

The type species is the great black-backed gull (&quot;Larus marinus&quot;). The Latin name &quot;Larus marinus&quot; translates as &quot;sea gull&quot;, and the gulls in this genus generally are the species most often known colloquially as &quot;seagulls&quot;.

===Species===
The genus contains 25 extant species.



















====Fossils====
Fossils of &quot;Larus&quot; gulls are known from the Middle Miocene, about 20-15 million years ago; allocation of earlier fossils to this genus is generally rejected. Biogeography of the fossil record suggests that the genus evolved in the northern Atlantic and spread globally during the Pliocene, when species diversity seems to have been highest, as with most seabirds.

*&quot;Larus&quot; sp. (Middle Miocene of Grund, Austria)
*&quot;Larus&quot; sp. (Middle Miocene of Romania)
*&quot;Larus&quot; sp. (Late? Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, U.S.) - several species
*&quot;Larus elmorei&quot; (Middle Pliocene of Bone Valley, southeastern U.S.)
*&quot;Larus lacus&quot; (Late Pliocene of Pinecrest, southeastern U.S.)
*&quot;Larus perpetuus&quot; (Pliocene of southeastern U.S.)
*&quot;Larus&quot; sp. (San Diego Late Pliocene of the southwestern U.S.)
*&quot;Larus oregonus&quot; (Late Pliocene - Late Pleistocene of the west-central U.S.)
*&quot;Larus robustus&quot; (Late Pliocene - Late Pleistocene of the west-central U.S.)
*&quot;Larus&quot; sp. (Late Pleistocene of Lake Manix western U.S.)

&quot;&quot;Larus&quot; raemdonckii&quot; (Early Oligocene of Belgium) is now at least tentatively believed to belong in the procellariiform genus &quot;Puffinus&quot;. &quot;&quot;L.&quot; elegans&quot; (Late Oligocene?/Early Miocene of St-Gérand-le-Puy, France) and &quot;&quot;L.&quot; totanoides&quot; (Late Oligocene?/Early Miocene of southeastern France) are now in &quot;Laricola&quot;, while &quot;&quot;L.&quot; dolnicensis&quot; (Early Miocene of the Czech Republic) was actually a pratincole; it is now placed in &quot;Mioglareola&quot;.

The Early Miocene &quot;&quot;Larus&quot; desnoyersii&quot; (southeastern France) and &quot;&quot;L.&quot; pristinus&quot; (John Day Formation, Willow Creek, U.S.) probably do not belong in this genus; the former may be a skua.

==Ring species==
The circumpolar group of &quot;Larus&quot; gull species has often been cited as a classic example of the ring species. The range of these gulls forms a ring around the North Pole. The European herring gull, which lives primarily in Great Britain and Northern Europe, can hybridize with the American herring gull (living in North America), which can also interbreed with the Vega or East Siberian gull, the western subspecies of which, Birula&#x27;s gull, can hybridize with Heuglin&#x27;s gull which, in turn, can interbreed with the Siberian lesser black-backed gull (all four of these live across the north of Siberia). The last is the eastern representative of the lesser black-backed gulls back in northwestern Europe, including Great Britain. However, the lesser black-backed gulls and herring gull are sufficiently different that they rarely interbreed; thus, the group of gulls forms a continuum except in Europe, where the two lineages meet. However, a recent genetic study has shown that this example is far more complicated than presented here, and probably does not constitute a true ring species.

<text>Coraciidae () is a family of Old World birds, which are known as rollers because of the aerial acrobatics some of these birds perform during courtship or territorial flights. The family contains 13 species and is divided into two genera. Rollers resemble crows in size and build, and share the colourful appearance of kingfishers and bee-eaters, blues and pinkish or cinnamon browns predominating. The two inner front toes are connected, but not the outer one.

They are mainly insect eaters, with &quot;Eurystomus&quot; species taking their prey on the wing, and those of the genus &quot;Coracias&quot; diving from a perch to catch food items from on the ground, like giant shrikes.

Although living rollers are birds of warm climates in the Old World, fossil records show that rollers were present in North America during the Eocene. They are monogamous and nest in an unlined hole in a tree or in masonry, and lay 2–4 eggs in the tropics, 3–6 at higher latitudes. The eggs, which are white, hatch after 17–20 days, and the young remain in the nest for approximately another 30 days.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The roller family Coraciidae was introduced (as Coracinia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.

It is one of six families in the order Coraciiformes, which also includes the motmots, bee-eaters, todies, ground rollers, and kingfishers. The family gets its scientific name for Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;like a raven&quot;, and the English name &quot;roller&quot; from the aerial acrobatics some of these birds perform during courtship or territorial flights.

The phylogenetic relationship between the six families that make up the order Coraciiformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
A molecular phylogenetic study by Ulf Johansson and collaborators published in 2018 found that the azure dollarbird (&quot;Eurystomus azureus&quot;) was nested in a clade containing subspecies of the Oriental dollarbird (&quot;Eurystomus orientalis&quot;).

===Genera===
The roller family has two extant genera as follows:
==Description==
Rollers can be identified as medium-sized birds with strong, slightly hooked beaks and stocky bodies, often with brightly colored plumage. Rollers resemble crows in size and build, ranging from in length. They share the colourful appearance of kingfishers and bee-eaters, blues and pinkish or cinnamon browns predominating. The rollers are similar in general morphology to their relatives in the order Coraciiformes, having large heads on short necks, bright plumage, weak feet and short legs. The two inner front toes are connected, but not the outer one. The weakness of the feet and legs is reflected in their behaviour: rollers do not hop or move along perches and seldom use their feet other than for occasional lurching leaps along the ground pursuing escaping prey. The bill is robust, and is shorter yet broader in the genus &quot;Eurystomus&quot;, sometimes known as the broad-billed rollers. The broad-billed rollers have brightly coloured bills, whereas those of the &quot;Coracias&quot; (or true) rollers are black. Other differences between the two genera are in wing length; the more aerial &quot;Eurystomus&quot; rollers have longer wings (and shorter feet still) than the &quot;Coracias&quot; rollers, this reflects differences in their foraging ecology. Their calls are &quot;repeated short, gruff caws&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The rollers are found in warmer parts of the Old World. Africa has most species, and is believed to be where the family originated. This is supported by the fact that the related ground rollers are found on Madagascar. The European roller is completely migratory, breeding in Europe and wintering in Africa, and the dollarbird also leaves much of its breeding range in winter. Other species are sedentary or short-range migrants.
These are birds of open habitats with trees or other elevated perches from which to hunt.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===
Rollers are noisy and aggressive when defending their nesting territories, which they patrol while displaying their striking plumage. Intruders are attacked with intimidating rolling dives. They are monogamous and nest in an unlined hole in a tree or in masonry, and lay 2–4 eggs in the tropics, 3–6 at higher latitudes. The eggs, which are white, hatch after 17–20 days, and the young remain in the nest for approximately another 30 days. Egg laying is staggered at one-day intervals so that if food is short only the older larger nestlings get fed. The chicks are naked, blind and helpless when they hatch.

===Feeding===
&quot;Coracias&quot; rollers are watch-and-wait hunters. They sit in a tree or on a post before descending on their prey and carrying it back to a perch in the beak before dismembering it. They take a wide range of terrestrial invertebrates, and small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, rodents and young birds. They will take items avoided by many other birds, such as hairy caterpillars, insects with warning colouration and snakes.

&quot;Eurystomus&quot; rollers hunt on the wing, swooping on flying beetles, crickets and other insects which are crushed by their broad deep beaks and eaten on the wing. The azure roller and dollarbird will hunt huge swarms of termites and flying ants which appear after thunderstorms. Tens or hundreds of these rollers may be attracted to large swarms.

<text>A switched-mode power supply (SMPS), also called switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, switched power supply, or simply switcher, is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently.

Like other power supplies, a SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power, see AC adapter) to DC loads, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high-dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time (also known as duty cycle). In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. The switched-mode power supply&#x27;s higher electrical efficiency is an important advantage.

Switched-mode power supplies can also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply because the transformer can be much smaller. This is because it operates at a high switching frequency which ranges from several hundred kHz to several MHz in contrast to the 50 or 60 Hz mains frequency used by the transformer in a linear power supply. Despite the reduced transformer size, the power supply topology and electromagnetic compatibility requirements in commercial designs result in a usually much greater component count and corresponding circuit complexity.

Switching regulators are used as replacements for linear regulators when higher efficiency, smaller size or lighter weight is required. They are, however, more complicated; switching currents can cause electrical noise problems if not carefully suppressed, and simple designs may have a poor power factor.

==Explanation==
A linear power supply (non-SMPS) uses a linear regulator to provide the desired output voltage by dissipating power in ohmic losses (e.g., in a resistor or in the collector–emitter region of a pass transistor in its active mode). A linear regulator regulates either output voltage or current by dissipating the electric power in the form of heat, and hence its maximum power efficiency is voltage-out divided by voltage-in since the voltage difference between input and output is wasted.

In contrast, a SMPS changes output voltage and current by switching ideally lossless storage elements, such as inductors and capacitors, between different electrical configurations. Ideal switching elements (approximated by transistors operated outside of their active mode) have no resistance when &quot;on&quot; and carry no current when &quot;off&quot;, and so converters with ideal components would operate with 100% efficiency (i.e., all input power is delivered to the load; no power is wasted as dissipated heat). In reality, these ideal components do not exist, so a switching power supply cannot be 100% efficient, but it is still a significant improvement in efficiency over a linear regulator.
For example, if a DC source, an inductor, a switch, and the corresponding electrical ground are placed in series and the switch is driven by a square wave, the peak-to-peak voltage of the waveform measured across the switch can exceed the input voltage from the DC source. This is because the inductor responds to changes in current by inducing its own voltage to counter the change in current, and this voltage adds to the source voltage while the switch is open. If a diode-and-capacitor combination is placed in parallel to the switch, the peak voltage can be stored in the capacitor, and the capacitor can be used as a DC source with an output voltage greater than the DC voltage driving the circuit. This boost converter acts like a step-up transformer for DC signals. A buck–boost converter works in a similar manner, but yields an output voltage which is opposite in polarity to the input voltage. Other buck circuits exist to boost the average output current with a reduction of voltage.

In a SMPS, the output current flow depends on the input power signal, the storage elements and circuit topologies used, and also on the pattern used (e.g., pulse-width modulation with an adjustable duty cycle) to drive the switching elements. The spectral density of these switching waveforms has energy concentrated at relatively high frequencies. As such, switching transients and ripple introduced onto the output waveforms can be filtered with a small LC filter.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The main advantage of the switching power supply is greater efficiency (up to c. 98–99%) and lower heat generation than linear regulators because the switching transistor dissipates little power when acting as a switch.

Other advantages include smaller size, and lighter weight from the elimination of heavy and expensive line-frequency transformers. Standby power loss is often much less than transformers.

Disadvantages include greater complexity, the generation of high-amplitude, high-frequency energy that the low-pass filter must block to avoid electromagnetic interference (EMI), a ripple voltage at the switching frequency and its harmonic frequencies.

Very low-cost SMPSs may couple electrical switching noise back onto the mains power line, causing interference with devices connected to the same phase, such as A/V equipment. Non-power-factor-corrected SMPSs also cause harmonic distortion.

==SMPS and linear power supply comparison==
There are two main types of regulated power supplies available: SMPS and linear. The following table compares linear with switching power supplies in general:

==Theory of operation==

===Input rectifier stage===

If the SMPS has an AC input, then the first stage is to convert the input to DC. This is called &#x27;rectification&#x27;. An SMPS with a DC input does not require this stage. In some power supplies (mostly computer ATX power supplies), the rectifier circuit can be configured as a voltage doubler by the addition of a switch operated either manually or automatically. This feature permits operation from power sources that are normally at 115 VAC or at 230 VAC. The rectifier produces an unregulated DC voltage which is then sent to a large filter capacitor. The current drawn from the mains supply by this rectifier circuit occurs in short pulses around the AC voltage peaks. These pulses have significant high frequency energy which reduces the power factor. To correct for this, many newer SMPS will use a special power factor correction (PFC) circuit to make the input current follow the sinusoidal shape of the AC input voltage, correcting the power factor. Power supplies that use active PFC usually are auto-ranging, supporting input voltages from , with no input voltage selector switch.

An SMPS designed for AC input can usually be run from a DC supply, because the DC would pass through the rectifier unchanged. If the power supply is designed for and has no voltage selector switch, the required DC voltage would be (115 × √2). This type of use may be harmful to the rectifier stage, however, as it will only use half of diodes in the rectifier for the full load. This could possibly result in overheating of these components, causing them to fail prematurely. On the other hand, if the power supply has a voltage selector switch, based on the Delon circuit, for 115/230 V (computer ATX power supplies typically are in this category), the selector switch would have to be put in the position, and the required voltage would be (230 × √2). The diodes in this type of power supply will handle the DC current just fine because they are rated to handle double the nominal input current when operated in the mode, due to the operation of the voltage doubler. This is because the doubler, when in operation, uses only half of the bridge rectifier and runs twice as much current through it.

===Inverter stage===
:This section refers to the block marked &quot;chopper&quot; in the diagram.

The inverter stage converts DC, whether directly from the input or from the rectifier stage described above, to AC by running it through a power oscillator, whose output transformer is very small with few windings, at a frequency of tens or hundreds of kilohertz. The frequency is usually chosen to be above 20 kHz, to make it inaudible to humans. The switching is implemented as a multistage (to achieve high gain) MOSFET amplifier. MOSFETs are a type of transistor with a low on-resistance and a high current-handling capacity.

===Voltage converter and output rectifier===
If the output is required to be isolated from the input, as is usually the case in mains power supplies, the inverted AC is used to drive the primary winding of a high-frequency transformer. This converts the voltage up or down to the required output level on its secondary winding. The output transformer in the block diagram serves this purpose.

If a DC output is required, the AC output from the transformer is rectified. For output voltages above ten volts or so, ordinary silicon diodes are commonly used. For lower voltages, Schottky diodes are commonly used as the rectifier elements; they have the advantages of faster recovery times than silicon diodes (allowing low-loss operation at higher frequencies) and a lower voltage drop when conducting. For even lower output voltages, MOSFETs may be used as synchronous rectifiers; compared to Schottky diodes, these have even lower conducting state voltage drops.

The rectified output is then smoothed by a filter consisting of inductors and capacitors. For higher switching frequencies, components with lower capacitance and inductance are needed.

Simpler, non-isolated power supplies contain an inductor instead of a transformer. This type includes &quot;boost converters&quot;, &quot;buck converters&quot;, and &quot;buck–boost converters&quot;. These belong to the simplest class of single input, single output converters which use one inductor and one active switch. The buck converter reduces the input voltage in direct proportion to the ratio of conductive time to the total switching period, called the duty cycle. For example, an ideal buck converter with a 10 V input operating at a 50% duty cycle will produce an average output voltage of 5 V. A feedback control loop is employed to regulate the output voltage by varying the duty cycle to compensate for variations in input voltage. The output voltage of a boost converter is always greater than the input voltage and the buck–boost output voltage is inverted but can be greater than, equal to, or less than the magnitude of its input voltage. There are many variations and extensions to this class of converters but these three form the basis of almost all isolated and non-isolated DC-to-DC converters. By adding a second inductor the Ćuk and SEPIC converters can be implemented, or, by adding additional active switches, various bridge converters can be realized.

Other types of SMPSs use a capacitor–diode voltage multiplier instead of inductors and transformers. These are mostly used for generating high voltages at low currents (&quot;Cockcroft-Walton generator&quot;). The low voltage variant is called charge pump.

===Regulation===

A feedback circuit monitors the output voltage and compares it with a reference voltage. Depending on design and safety requirements, the controller may contain an isolation mechanism (such as an opto-coupler) to isolate it from the DC output. Switching supplies in computers, TVs and VCRs have these opto-couplers to tightly control the output voltage.

&quot;Open-loop regulators&quot; do not have a feedback circuit. Instead, they rely on feeding a constant voltage to the input of the transformer or inductor, and assume that the output will be correct. Regulated designs compensate for the impedance of the transformer or coil. Monopolar designs also compensate for the magnetic hysteresis of the core.

The feedback circuit needs power to run before it can generate power, so an additional non-switching power supply for stand-by is added.

==Transformer design==
Any switched-mode power supply that gets its power from an AC power line (called an &quot;off-line&quot; converter) requires a transformer for galvanic isolation. Some DC-to-DC converters may also include a transformer, although isolation may not be critical in these cases. SMPS transformers run at high frequencies. Most of the cost savings (and space savings) in off-line power supplies result from the smaller size of the high-frequency transformer compared to the 50/60 Hz transformers formerly used. There are additional design tradeoffs.

The terminal voltage of a transformer is proportional to the product of the core area, magnetic flux, and frequency. By using a much higher frequency, the core area (and so the mass of the core) can be greatly reduced. However, core losses increase at higher frequencies. Cores generally use ferrite material which has a low loss at the high frequencies and high flux densities used. The laminated iron cores of lower-frequency (&lt;400 Hz) transformers would be unacceptably lossy at switching frequencies of a few kilohertz. Also, more energy is lost during transitions of the switching semiconductor at higher frequencies. Furthermore, more attention to the physical layout of the circuit board is required as parasitics become more significant, and the amount of electromagnetic interference will be more pronounced.

===Copper loss===

At low frequencies (such as the line frequency of 50 or 60 Hz), designers can usually ignore the skin effect. For these frequencies, the skin effect is only significant when the conductors are large, more than in diameter.

Switching power supplies must pay more attention to the skin effect because it is a source of power loss. At 500 kHz, the skin depth in copper is about – a dimension smaller than the typical wires used in a power supply. The effective resistance of conductors increases, because current concentrates near the surface of the conductor and the inner portion carries less current than at low frequencies.

The skin effect is exacerbated by the harmonics present in the high-speed pulse-width modulation (PWM) switching waveforms. The appropriate skin depth is not just the depth at the fundamental, but also the skin depths at the harmonics.

In addition to the skin effect, there is also a proximity effect, which is another source of power loss.

==Power factor==
Simple off-line switched-mode power supplies incorporate a simple full-wave rectifier connected to a large energy-storing capacitor. Such SMPSs draw current from the AC line in short pulses when the mains instantaneous voltage exceeds the voltage across this capacitor. During the remaining portion of the AC cycle the capacitor provides energy to the power supply.

As a result, the input current of such basic switched-mode power supplies has high harmonic content and relatively low power factor. This creates extra load on utility lines, increases heating of building wiring, the utility transformers, and standard AC electric motors, and may cause stability problems in some applications such as in emergency generator systems or aircraft generators. Harmonics can be removed by filtering, but the filters are expensive. Unlike displacement power factor created by linear inductive or capacitive loads, this distortion cannot be corrected by addition of a single linear component. Additional circuits are required to counteract the effect of the brief current pulses. Putting a current regulated boost chopper stage after the off-line rectifier (to charge the storage capacitor) can correct the power factor, but increases the complexity and cost.

In 2001, the European Union put into effect the standard IEC 61000-3-2 to set limits on the harmonics of the AC input current up to the 40th harmonic for equipment above 75 W. The standard defines four classes of equipment depending on its type and current waveform. The most rigorous limits (class D) are established for personal computers, computer monitors, and TV receivers. To comply with these requirements, modern switched-mode power supplies normally include an additional power factor correction (PFC) stage.

==Types==
Switched-mode power supplies can be classified according to the circuit topology. The most important distinction is between isolated converters and non-isolated ones.

===Non-isolated topologies===
Non-isolated converters are simplest, with the three basic types using a single inductor for energy storage. In the voltage relation column, &quot;D&quot; is the duty cycle of the converter, and can vary from 0 to 1. The input voltage (V1) is assumed to be greater than zero; if it is negative, for consistency, negate the output voltage (V2).

When equipment is human-accessible, voltage limits of ≤ 30 V (r.m.s.) AC or ≤ 42.4 V peak or ≤ 60 V DC and power limits of 250 VA apply for safety certification (UL, CSA, VDE approval).

The buck, boost, and buck–boost topologies are all strongly related. Input, output and ground come together at one point. One of the three passes through an inductor on the way, while the other two pass through switches. One of the two switches must be active (e.g., a transistor), while the other can be a diode. Sometimes, the topology can be changed simply by re-labeling the connections. A 12 V input, 5 V output buck converter can be converted to a 7 V input, −5 V output buck–boost by grounding the &quot;output&quot; and taking the output from the &quot;ground&quot; pin.

Likewise, SEPIC and Zeta converters are both minor rearrangements of the Ćuk converter.

The &quot;neutral point clamped&quot; (NPC) topology is used in power supplies and active filters and is mentioned here for completeness.

Switchers become less efficient as duty cycles become extremely short. For large voltage changes, a transformer (isolated) topology may be better.

===Isolated topologies===
All isolated topologies include a transformer, and thus can produce an output of higher or lower voltage than the input by adjusting the turns ratio. For some topologies, multiple windings can be placed on the transformer to produce multiple output voltages. Some converters use the transformer for energy storage, while others use a separate inductor.

* Flyback converter logarithmic control loop behavior might be harder to control than other types.
* The forward converter has several variants, varying in how the transformer is &quot;reset&quot; to zero magnetic flux every cycle.
Chopper controller:
The output voltage is coupled to the input thus very tightly controlled

===Quasi-resonant zero-current/zero-voltage switch===

In a quasi-resonant zero-current/zero-voltage switch (ZCS/ZVS) &quot;each switch cycle delivers a quantized &#x27;packet&#x27; of energy to the converter output, and switch turn-on and turn-off occurs at zero current and voltage, resulting in an essentially lossless switch.&quot; Quasi-resonant switching, also known as &quot;valley switching&quot;, reduces EMI in the power supply by two methods:
# By switching the bipolar switch when the voltage is at a minimum (in the valley) to minimize the hard switching effect that causes EMI.
# By switching when a valley is detected, rather than at a fixed frequency, introduces a natural frequency jitter that spreads the RF emissions spectrum and reduces overall EMI.

==Efficiency and EMI==
Higher input voltage and synchronous rectification mode makes the conversion process more efficient. The power consumption of the controller also has to be taken into account. Higher switching frequency allows component sizes to be shrunk, but can produce more RFI. A resonant forward converter produces the lowest EMI of any SMPS approach because it uses a soft-switching resonant waveform compared with conventional hard switching.

==Failure modes==
SMPSs tend to be temperature sensitive. For every 10-15 °C beyond 25 °C, failure rate doubles. Most failures can be attributed to improper design and poor component selections.

Power supplies with capacitors that have reached the end of their life or suffer from manufacturing defects such as the capacitor plague will fail eventually. When either the capacitance decreases or the ESR increases, the regulator compensates by increasing the switching frequency, thereby subjecting the switching semiconductors to ever greater thermal stress. Eventually the switching semiconductors fail, usually in a conductive manner. For power supplies without fail-safe protection, this may subject connected loads to the full input voltage and current, and wild oscillations can occur in the output.

Failure of the switching transistor is common. Due to the large switching voltages this transistor must handle (around for a non-power-factor-corrected mains supply, otherwise usually around ), these transistors often short out, in turn immediately blowing the main internal power fuse.

Power supplies in consumer products are frequently damaged by lightning strikes on power lines as well as internal short circuits caused by insects attracted to the heat and electrostatic fields. Those events may damage any part of the power supply.

==Precautions==
The main filter capacitor will often store up to long after the input power has been disconnected. Not all power supplies contain a small &quot;bleeder&quot; resistor which slowly discharges the capacitor. Contact with this capacitor can result in a severe electrical shock.

The primary and secondary sides may be connected with a capacitor to reduce EMI and compensate for various capacitive couplings in the converter circuit, where the transformer is one. This may result in electric shock in some cases. The current flowing from line or neutral through a resistor to any accessible part must, according to , be less than for IT equipment.

==Applications==

Switched-mode power supply units (PSUs) in domestic products such as personal computers often have universal inputs, meaning that they can accept power from mains supplies throughout the world, although a manual voltage range switch may be required. Switch-mode power supplies can tolerate a wide range of power frequencies and voltages.

Due to their high volumes mobile phone chargers have always been particularly cost sensitive. The first chargers were linear power supplies, but they quickly moved to the cost-effective ringing choke converter (RCC) SMPS topology, when new levels of efficiency were required. Recently, the demand for even lower no-load power requirements in the application has meant that flyback topology is being used more widely; primary side sensing flyback controllers are also helping to cut the bill of materials (BOM) by removing secondary-side sensing components such as optocouplers.

Switched-mode power supplies are used for DC-to-DC conversion as well. In heavy vehicles that use a nominal cranking supply, 12 V for accessories may be furnished through a DC/DC switch-mode supply. This has the advantage over tapping the battery at the 12 V position (using half the cells) that the entire 12 V load is evenly divided between all cells of the 24 V battery. In industrial settings such as telecommunications racks, bulk power may be distributed at a low DC voltage (e.g. from a battery backup system) and individual equipment items will have DC/DC switched-mode converters to supply required voltages.

A common use for switched-mode power supplies is an extra-low-voltage source for lighting. For this application, they are often called &quot;electronic transformers&quot;.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;switch mode&quot; was widely used until Motorola claimed ownership of the trademark SWITCHMODE for products aimed at the switching-mode power supply market and started to enforce its trademark. &quot;Switching-mode power supply&quot;, &quot;switching power supply&quot;, and &quot;switching regulator&quot; refer to this type of power supply.

<doc id="223415" wikidata="Q13380731" url="?curid=223415" title="Mahseer">
<text>Mahseer is the common name used for the genera &quot;Tor&quot;, &quot;Neolissochilus&quot;, &quot;Naziritor&quot; and &quot;Parator&quot; in the family Cyprinidae (carps). The name is, however, more often restricted to members of the genus &quot;Tor&quot;. The range of these fish is from Vietnam in the east and China in the north, through Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia, and across southern Asia including the countries of India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh within the Indian Peninsula, plus Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They are commercially important game fish, as well as highly esteemed food fish. Mahseer fetch high market price, and are potential candidate species for aquaculture. Several of the larger species have suffered severe declines, and are now considered threatened due to pollution, habitat loss, overfishing and increasing concern about the impacts of unregulated release of artificially bred stock of a very limited number of species.

The taxonomy of the mahseers is confusing due to the morphological variations they exhibit. In developing strategies for aquaculture and propagation assisted rehabilitation of mahseer species, resolution of taxonomic ambiguities is needed and adherence to IUCN stocking guidelines must be followed.

Mahseers inhabit both rivers and lakes, with some species believed to ascend into rapid streams with rocky bottoms for breeding. Like other types of carps, they are omnivorous, eating not only algae, crustaceans, insects, frogs, and other fish, but also fruits that fall from trees overhead.

The first species from this group were scientifically described by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1822, and first mentioned as an angling challenge by the &quot;Oriental Sporting Magazine&quot; in 1833, soon becoming a favorite quarry of British anglers living in India.
The golden mahseer &quot;Tor putitora&quot; was previously believed to be the largest member of the group and one of the largest cyprinids; it has been known to reach in length and in weight, although specimens of this size are rarely seen nowadays.

Currently, the largest of the mahseer is &quot;Tor remadevii&quot;, which is known to grow to in excess of . In 2011, UK angler Ken Loughran landed a fish that was too heavy for the 120lb scales being used. This fish was claimed as a &#x27;World record&#x27; at 130lb 10oz, although the weighing process used is in doubt.
In addition to being caught for sport, mahseer are also part of commercial fishing and ornamental or aquarium fish.

==Etymology==
The Hindi and Kumaoni name of &quot;mahāsir, mahāser&quot;, or &quot;mahāsaulā &quot;is used for a number of fishes of the group. Several sources of the common name &quot;mahseer&quot; have been suggested: It has been said to be derived from Sanskrit, while others claim it is derived from Indo-Persian, &quot;mahi&quot;- fish and &quot;sher&quot;- tiger or &quot;tiger among fish&quot; in Persian. Alternatively, &quot;mahā-śalka&quot;, meaning large-scaled, is suggested, as the scales are so large that Francis Buchanan mentions that playing cards were made from them at Dacca. Another theory by Henry Sullivan Thomas suggests &quot;mahā-āsya&quot;: &quot;great mouth.&quot; The name&quot; mahasher &quot;is commonly used in Urdu, Punjabi, and Kashmiri languages in Pakistan for this fish and is said to be made up of two local words: &quot;maha&quot; = big and &quot;sher&quot; = lion, as it ascends in the hilly rivers and streams of Himalaya courageously. Sadhale and Nene translate the Sanskrit word mahashila, as used in some texts as &quot;stone-like&quot;, interpreting that to mean a powerful fish.

Mahseers in Indonesia possess a multitude of names owing to the multiethnic composition of the country; in Java, they are referred to as &quot;ikan dewa&quot;; literally God-Fish or Fish of the Gods.

==Species==
Sen and Jayaram restrict the term mahseer to members of the genus &quot;Tor&quot;. However, the species of genus &quot;Neolissochilus&quot; and the genera &quot;Naziritor&quot; and &quot;Parator&quot; are also called mahseers due to their large-sized scales and other similarities.
Scientists now try to use the terms &#x27;true mahseer&#x27; for species within &quot;Tor&quot;, and &#x27;lesser mahseers&#x27; for species within &quot;Neolissochilus&quot;, &quot;Naziritor&quot; and &quot;Parator&quot;.

==Historical references==
Researchers working at sites from the Harappan era or Indus Valley civilisation, found collections of pottery decorated with fish motifs as well as fish bones left in midden pits. Hora describes his interpretation of each of the species depicted on the painted pots, which include most of the species common today in the Indus basin, including mahseer. During his work on the remains of fish bones, renowned ethnoarchaeologist Dr William R. Belcher discovered that while fish, including large species like Indian major carps and various catfish, comprised a substantial element of the diets of this 3300–1300 BCE civilisation, bones of mahseer were extremely rare. It has been suggested that this is the first known instance of mahseer being ‘revered’ or singled out from other fish species as ‘God&#x27;s fish’.

During the later period of the Chalukya dynasty, under the Western Chalukya Empire, King Someshvara III describes fishing in the rivers and seas around his kingdom, which include many areas that are inhabited by the mahseer species Tor remadevii, Tor malabaricus and Tor khudree. The king includes &quot;mahashila&quot;, a &quot;large river fish(es) of the scaly type.&quot; He then goes on to describe the best methods of Angling for the various fish species to be encountered in his kingdom, including how to prepare baits for each. There is a further description of how to prepare the fish for cooking and eating.

Many of the most detailed descriptions of mahseer begin to appear during the British colonisation of India, in particular, during the British Raj of 1857 to 1947. Many of those stationed in India enjoyed angling for mahseer, which they compared to the thrill of catching a salmon ‘back home’. Indeed, Henry Sullivan Thomas, author of one of the first books on angling in the colonies said &quot;the mahseer shows more sport for its size than a salmon.&quot; They also produced guidebooks and penned letters to sporting journals such as &quot;The Field&quot; and &quot;Fishing Gazette&quot;.

H.S. Thomas also gives a description of south Indian followers of Hinduism equating mahseer with Matsya, one of the incarnations of the god Vishnu and responsible for saving Manu from the flood. This tale is common in many of the classic Hindu texts, with the first reference being in the Shatapatha Brahmana, part of the Vedas body of works dated from 1500 to 400 BCE.

==In heraldry (and other official representations)==

Mahseer was an important symbol in the heraldry of certain Muslim-ruled former princely states of the Subcontinent such as Baoni, Bhopal, Kurwai and Rampur. Dost Mohammad Khan&#x27;s son Yar Mohammad received from Nizam-ul-Mulk the insignia of the &quot;Maha Muratib&quot; (the dignity of the Fish). The insignia became part of the Bhopal State&#x27;s coat of arms.

The Mahseer fish as an emblem of the highest honour in royalty is allegedly from Persian origin and was adopted by the courts of Oudh and the Paigah nobles of Hyderabad State, being later passed down to other states of the area.

In India, many states have adopted mahseer as their State Fish. Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand all have the golden mahseer, Nagaland has the &#x27;Chocolate mahseer&#x27;, &quot;Neolissochilus hexagonolepis&quot; as their State Fish, Odisha has the fish known as &#x27;Mahanadi mahseer&#x27;, &quot;Tor mosal mahanadicus&quot; as its State Fish. The southern state of Karnataka is considering changing its State Fish from Carnatic carp to the IUCN Red Listed &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; &quot;Tor remadevii&quot;.

There have been calls for &quot;Tor tambra&quot;, the &#x27;Java mahseer&#x27; known locally as emperau, to be adopted as the national fish of Malaysia.

==Conservation issues for mahseer==
Translocation movements of mahseer within India have been happening since the 1850s, at least. During this period, the integrity and identity of species was poorly understood, which may have caused unintentional issues of Hybridisation between species or competition from Invasive species.

Among the best documented areas where fish movements have been used for reasons of improving angling sport, or attempting to augment declining stocks are the Lakes of Kumaon hills. The Kumaon lakes in Uttarakhand, Bhimtal Lake, Nainital Lake, Naukuchiatal Lake and Sattal Lake, were stocked with mahseer in 1858 by Sir H. Ramsey, with stock brought from the rivers Gaula and Kali. According to Walker in his &#x27;Angling in the Kumaon Lakes&#x27;, the Bhimtal stocking was less successful, until a second batch of fish were introduced in 1878.
Dr Raj, Fisheries Development Officer in United Provinces, in his 1945 report on the decline of mahseer stocks in the lakes says:
&quot;From all reports these isolated lakes had hardly any fish in them before the introduction of mahseer.&quot;

This is clearly a misunderstanding of the history of mahseer in the lakes, as Walker earlier says:

The inference must be that the introductions of mahseer into the lakes caused the unexpected decline of several native fish stocks, either due to competition, or by direct predation and that the earlier fish stocks were notable.
In Himachal Pradesh, golden mahseer is depleting at a fast rate from the state even though it was categorised as an endangered species by the National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources as early as 1992.

In common with most areas within the geographic range of mahseers, the factors leading to this situation are mainly anthropogenic distortion of rivers due to the construction of river valley projects, multipurpose dams, shrinking habitat, poaching and other stock exploitation, and widespread introduction of invasive species.

Intentional stocking of mahseers in the trans-Himalayan region have been taking place for several years. It has been reported that the Teesta River in Sikkim and West Bengal has been stocked with hundreds of thousands of golden mahseer every year since at least 2014 in a drive to promote angling in the region. That the fish stocks continue to decline suggests that the policy needs to be reviewed and more efforts devoted to improving habitat as the first priority.

==Revision of all mahseer species==
In May 2019, Mahseer Trust and collaborators published a major revision paper. This paper includes the latest IUCN Red Listing status and validity of 16 species of the Tor genus. Following this publication, fresh impetus into understanding the ecology of wild populations and establishing more secure species identities will allow coherent conservation programmes to be enacted, and fish currently listed Data Deficient to be accorded with relevant threat status.

==Conferences==
Over several decades, concerned organisations have arranged conferences to debate issues around mahseer conservation. Among the early events was the Kuala Lumpur Conference of 2005, and in 2014, WWF-India convened a forum in Delhi. Both of these events looked at many issues specific to mahseer, and typical outputs included measures to investigate greater understanding of mahseer ecology.

In 2017, Mahseer Trust convened a different kind of event, by including representatives to discuss all aspects of both the fish and the river habitat in which they live. This unique conference included sessions aired live on social media, with a final question and answer session reaching 6,000 viewers.

December 2018 saw the First International Conference, in Paro, Bhutan.
Among the many recommendations were increased research into the ecology of wild mahseer and ensuring artificial breeding of mahseer is done under strict control using IUCN guidelines.

IMC2 was held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in February 2020.

Roundtable workshops on the final day agreed to produce outputs, including papers, white paper proposals and outreach media, in the following areas of concern: 
* What is a mahseer? Considering taxonomy.
* Value of recreational angling. Setting standards.
* Impacts of invasive species. Ways to ensure enforcement.
* Developing outreach and education. To share messages and programmes.

<text>Angling (from Old English &quot;angol&quot;, meaning &quot;hook&quot;) is a fishing technique that uses a fish hook attached to a fishing line to tether individual fish in the mouth. The fishing line is usually manipulated via a fishing rod, although rodless techniques such as handlining also exist. Modern angling rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a cranking device for storing, retrieving and releasing out the line, although Tenkara fishing and traditional cane pole fishing are two rod-angling methods that do not use any reel. The fish hook itself can be additionally weighted with a denser tackle called a sinker, and is typically dressed with an appetizing bait (i.e. hookbait) to attract and entice the fish into swallowing the hook, but sometimes an inedible fake/imitation bait with multiple attached hooks (known as a lure) is used instead of a single hook with edible bait. Some type of bite indicator, such as a float, a bell or a quiver tip, is often used to relay underwater status of the hook to the surface and alert the angler of a fish&#x27;s presence.

When angling, the fisherman (known as the angler) will first throw the hook (i.e. &quot;cast&quot;) to a chosen area of water (i.e. fishing ground), and then patiently wait for fish to approach and devour the hookbait. It is also not uncommon for the angler to scatter some loose bait (groundbait) around the target area before even casting the hook, to better attract distant fish with scents. If a fish has succumbed to its own feeding instinct and swallowed the baited hook (i.e. &quot;bite&quot; or &quot;strike&quot;), the hook point will likely pierce into and anchor itself inside the fish jaw, gullet or gill, and the fish in turn becomes firmly tethered by the fishing line. Once the fish is hooked (often colloquially called &quot;fish-on&quot;), any struggles and attempts to escape will pull along the line, causing the bite indicator to signal the angler, who jerks the fishing rod back to further deepen the hook anchorage (i.e. &quot;setting the hook&quot;) and then tries to retrieve the line back, pulling the fish closer in the process. During the line retrieval, the angler will carefully monitor the line and rod tension to avoid equipment breaking. With stronger and feistier fish, the angler might need to temporarily halt or even reverse the line retrieval to prolong the struggle time and tire out the fish (i.e. &quot;walking&quot; the fish), before dragging it near enough to eventually lift it out of the water (known as &quot;landing&quot;) for a successful catch. Sometimes a hand net (or &quot;landing net&quot;) or a long-handled hook is used to make fetching the fish easier.

Angling is the principal method of recreational fishing, but commercial fisheries also use angling methods such as longlining, trotlining or trolling. In many parts of the world, a fishing licence is mandated for angling and size limits apply to certain species, meaning by law, fish below and/or above a certain size range must be released alive after capture. The popular fish species pursued by anglers, collectively known as game fish, vary with geography. Among the many species of saltwater fish that are angled for sport globally are billfish (swordfish, sailfish and marlin), tuna, trevally and grouper, while cod and sea bass are popular targets in Europe. In North America, the popular freshwater fish species include bass, northern pike/muskellunge, walleye, trout and anadromous salmon, tilapia, channel catfish and panfishes such as crappie, sunfish (e.g. bluegill) and yellow perch. In Europe, Asia and Australasia, freshwater anglers often pursue species such as carp, pike, bream, tench, rudd, roach, European perch, catfish and barbel, many of which are regarded as undesirable &quot;rough fish&quot; in North America. In developed countries, catch and release angling is increasingly practiced by sport fishermen in recent years to conserve the fish stocks and help maintain sustainability of the local fisheries.

Angling is not to be confused with snagging, another fishing technique that also uses line and hook to catch fish. The principal differences between the two techniques are that angling often uses very small hooks and relies on the target fish itself to voluntarily swallow the hook to pierce &quot;internally&quot; into the fish&#x27;s mouth; while snagging uses very large, sharp, multi-pointed grappling hooks that actively &quot;claw&quot; and pierce &quot;externally&quot; into the body/gill of the fish, and hardly ever involves any hookbait. Snagging also inflicts far more mutilating injuries to the fish and makes it very difficult to heal and survive even if the fish is released alive or manages to escape the snag.

== Tackles ==
=== Hook ===
The use of the hook in angling is descended, historically, from what would today be called a &quot;gorge&quot;. The word &quot;gorge&quot;, in this context, comes from the French word meaning &quot;throat&quot;. Gorges were used by ancient peoples to capture fish and animals like seal, walrus and birds. A gorge was a long, thin piece of bone or stone attached by its midpoint to a thin line. The gorge would be baited so that it would rest parallel to the lay of the line. When the game would swallow the bait, a tug on the line would cause the gorge to orient itself at right angles to the line, thereby sticking in the fish or animal&#x27;s throat or gullet. Gorges evolved into the modern fishing hook which is J-shaped with a loop on one end and a sharp point on the other. Most hooks have a barb near the point to better anchor the point and prevent a fish from unhooking itself while being reeled in. Some laws and regulations require hooks to be barbless, typically to facilitate catch and release. This rule is commonly implemented to protect populations of certain species, as a barbed hook could cause significant collateral lacerations (especially when it penetrates the gill) that can kill a fish even after released alive.

=== Line ===
Fishing lines are long, ultra-thin, flexible cords that may come in monofilament or braided multifilament forms. Traditional fishing lines are made of silk, while most modern fishing lines are made from synthetic polymers such as nylon, polyethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride (&quot;fluorocarbon&quot;) or copolymer materials. Important specifications for a fishing line include its material and forms, test weight, diameter, stretch, memory, abrasion resistance, UV resistance, and reflective and/or refractive visibility.

=== Rod ===
A fishing rod is a long, thin stick/pole that acts as an extended lever and allows the angler to amplify line movements while luring and pulling the fish. It also enhances casting distance by lengthening the swing radius (compared to that of a human arm) and increasing the launch speed of the terminal tackles (the hook, bait/lure, and other co-launched attachments such as float and sinker/feeder). Traditional fishing rods are made from single piece of hardwood (e.g. ash and hickory) or bamboo, while contemporary rods are usually made from alloys (e.g. aluminium) or more often high-tensile composite materials such as fibreglass or carbon fiber, and newer rod designs are often constructed from hollow blanks to increase the specific strength and reduce the overall weight. Modern rods also may come in multi-piece or telescoping forms, which are more portable and storage-friendly.

=== Reel ===
Fishing reels are manually cranked reels typically mounted onto a fishing rod, used to wind and stow fishing line when a long casting distance or a prolonged retrieval is expected. Traditional fishing reels are essentially compact windlasses with a &quot;direct-drive&quot; design, while modern reels since the Industrial Revolution typically are &quot;multiplier&quot; reels that use internal gear trains to gain a higher rotational speed. Most reels made from the latter half of the 20th century onwards have smoother line guides, anti-reverse designs, gear disengagement mechanisms and sophisticated drag and braking adjustments to help casting farther, more accurately and reliably, and to provide optimal pulling forces when retrieving the line.

=== Bite indicator ===
A bite indicator is any device that can help to notify the angler that the hook has been swallowed by a fish. There are many types of bite indicators, the oldest and most ubiquitously used being the fishing float, a lightweight marker buoy that floats at the water surface with the hook and bait suspended below it. When the fish swallows the hook, the leader line between the hook and the float pulls the float deeper into the water, causing it to oscillates in and out of water in a bobbing-like fashion (hence its American English name, the &quot;bobber&quot;).

Other bite indicators used in angling include:
* Fishing bell — an (often plastic) bulldog clip attached to a pair of small jingle bells, used often in surf fishing and bank fishing involving rod holders. When clipped onto the fishing rod, the bells will rattle when vibrations are transmitted onto the rod from the fishing line, and the sound can alert the angler.
* Quiver tip — a (typically removable) elastic extension to the distal end of the fishing rod, used in bottom fishing (which does not use floats) and often in conjunction with fishing bells. As the name suggests, the more flexible tip extension will amplify any vibration transmitted from the line to the rod, allowing the angler to see the tip &quot;quiver&quot; and be alerted to any changes along the line.
* Bite alarm – an electronic alarm device comprising a buzzer and a vibration sensor that is placed in close contact with the fishing rod and/or line, designed to give off a bleep sound each time the line is tugged. Bite alarms come in different sizes and forms, from compact devices that clips onto the rod like a fishing bell, to large multi-rod holder racks with different bleep tone and sound quality settings. Some bite alarms also incorporate LED lighting that can visually indicate in addition to the sound alert, in case the angler happens to temporarily wander away from the rod and cannot hear the sound clearly.

== Baits ==
In angling, two broad types of baits are used: &quot;groundbait&quot;, which is thrown separately into the water in large quantities as an &quot;appetizer&quot; to olfactorily attract distant fish nearer to the angler&#x27;s position; and &quot;hookbait&quot;, which is directly attached to the fish hook to entice the fish into swallowing the hook along with the bait. In colloquial usage, the word &quot;bait&quot; refers specifically to hookbaits, which can be further separated into three main categories: &quot;natural baits&quot;, &quot;artificial baits&quot; and &quot;lures&quot;.

The choice of what bait to use is dictated mainly by the target species&#x27;s diet, the habitat and weather conditions](which can alter the fish&#x27;s foraging behavior), the angler&#x27;s own personal preferences, and the local fishery regulations. Using an optimal angling bait can increase the chance of catching the intended fish, while conversely using an inadequate bait will greatly reduce the success rate, especially when there are other bait fishermen nearby.

===Natural baits===

Natural baits are food items that are present within the target fish&#x27;s natural diet, which are usually animals at a lower trophic level in the food web. A natural bait angler, with few exceptions, will use a common prey species of the target fish as a bait. The natural bait used may be live food (known as a &quot;live bait&quot;) or (i.e. &quot;dead bait&quot;), and a bait improvised from grossly intact portions of a dead animal (e.g. fish head) is known as a &quot;cutbait&quot;. Common natural baits for both fresh and saltwater fishing include earthworm, leech, insects and larvae, minnow, squid, prawn, crayfish, and even crabs, frogs and salamanders. Natural baits are effective due to the real texture, odour and movements of the bait presented.

The common earthworm is a universal live bait for freshwater angling, and grubs and maggots are also excellent bait when trout fishing. Grasshoppers, crickets, eels and even ants are also used as bait for trout in their season, although many anglers believe that trout or salmon roe is superior to any other bait.
Crayfish, which are preyed upon by a variety of ray-finned fishes, are also commonly used as bait, either live or with only the tail meat. They are popular for catching catfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, striped bass, perch and pike. However, studies had confirmed that introducing crayfish outside of their home range has led to various ecological problems of them becoming invasive species. Transporting crayfish as live bait has also contributed to the spread of zebra mussels, which are known to attach themselves onto crayfish, in various waterways throughout Europe and North America.

====Spreading diseases====
The capture, transportation and culture of bait fish can spread damaging organisms between ecosystems, endangering them. In 2007 several American states enacted regulations designed to slow the spread of fish diseases, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia, by bait fish. Because of the risk of transmitting &quot;Myxobolus cerebralis&quot; (whirling disease), trout and salmon should not be used as bait.

Anglers may increase the possibility of contamination by emptying bait buckets into fishing venues and collecting or using bait improperly. The transportation of fish from one location to another can break the law and cause the introduction of fish alien to the ecosystem.

===Artificial baits===

Artificial baits are edible baits that are not directly acquired via natural means, but are made from other food materials via some kind of artificial processing. These can be fish food that are either homemade (e.g. dried food paste) or commercially purchased (e.g. boilies and feed pellets), or prepared/processed food such as cutlets, offals, dehulled kernels (e.g. peas and corns), dairy products (cheese and curd), bread or doughballs made from various ingredient mixtures (e.g. rice, semolina, cornmeal, bread crumbs, and fishmeal, etc.), which can be used to attract omnivorous or even herbivorous fish. In lakes in southern climates such as Florida, panfish such as sunfish will even take household wheat bread or pet food as bait. These bread bait is prepared from a small amount of bread, often moistened and softened by saliva, then squeezed into a ball of the bite size of small fish.

===Lures===

Some baits are not actual food items but rather just &quot;fake&quot; replicas of food made of inedible materials (e.g. wood, metal, silicone rubber, plastics, etc), and are designed to entice predatory fish to strike by imitating the appearance and motions of real prey (shad, worm, frog, insect, crayfish, etc.). These inedible, replica baits are typically called &quot;lures&quot; instead of baits, although expressions such as &quot;swimbaits&quot;, &quot;crankbaits&quot;, &quot;jerkbaits&quot;, &quot;spinnerbaits&quot; and &quot;chatterbaits&quot; are still used when describing specific types of lures. Unlike conventional baits, lures typically do not release any scents and rely solely on looks and sounds/vibrations to attract fish, although occasionally chemical attractants (e.g. dimethyl-β-propiothetin) are still used in addition either to impregnate favorable smells or to mask away unwanted plastic smells. Many anglers prefer to fish solely using lures, as these rely more on the user&#x27;s rod and reel actions to successfully attract fish, and requires frequent casting and retrieving the line, and are thus more interactive and exciting.

Lures can be broadly categorized into &quot;hard-body&quot; and &quot;soft-body lures&quot;, although hybrid lures with both hard and soft components are also common. Soft-body lures tend to give a more flexible and realistic &quot;swimming&quot; posture when towed through the water, while hard-body lures usually rely on stirring up more noise and turbulences. Some newer hard lure designs, however, are multi-jointed and can resemble soft lures in dynamics. Soft lures are typically coupled with a single conventional fish hook or a jighead, while hard lures commonly have more than one hooks (which are often treble hooks). When lures are used in combination with other terminal tackles (floats, sinkers, swivels, etc.) to produce sophisticated presentations, the entire lure package is known as a &quot;rig&quot;. Common rigs with a soft plastic lure are the Texas Rig or the Carolina Rig.

Some fishing lures (e.g. spoons and spinnerbaits) may not even resemble any prey in looks, and may require skilled rod movements to impart an enticing presentation to the target fish, for example in jigging and topwater fishing. Some lures, such as the flies used in fly fishing, are ultralight and even require specialized gears and techniques to be cast properly. In modern times, there are also lures that photically attract fish with LED illuminiation, as well as battery-powered &quot;bionic&quot; lures that are essentially primitive robot fish that can swim around without needing to be towed by a fishing line.

== Techniques ==

=== Rod fishing===
Almost all recreational angling activities involve the use of fishing rods, which is used to manipulate the movements of fishing lines and to allow farther casting of baits/lures. The main rod fishing techniques are float fishing, bottom fishing, lure fishing and trolling, while the former two are often collectively known as &quot;bait fishing&quot; due to the exclusive use of conventional edible baits.

==== Float fishing ====

Float fishing is the most common method of angling, defined by the use of a compact light buoy attached to fishing line – known as a &quot;float&quot; (or &quot;bobber&quot; in the United States) — as the bite indicator. Due to buoyancy, the float remains at the water surface and suspends the baited hook at a predetermined depth. It can also drift in the prevailing current and carry the hook to areas of water otherwise inaccessible by casting alone. When the fish bites and swallows the hook, the float visually signals any forces exerted on the leader line below it, as the fisherman can then see it being pulled underwater and/or sideways.

==== Bottom fishing ====

Bottom fishing, also called &quot;legering&quot; in the United Kingdom, uses a weighted tackle called a &quot;sinker&quot; tied to the end of the fishing line to keep the baited hook close to the bottom of the water, to target groundfishes such as sucker, bream, catfish and crappie. The sinker can also be used to add momentum to the hook and help casting the line to a further distance. The method can be used both with handlining and rod fishing, and can be done both from boats and from the land. Specialized fishing rods called &quot;donkas&quot; are also commonly used for bottom fishing, and a quiver tip (sometimes coupled with a jingle bell) is used instead as the bite indicator.

Some sinkers are replaced by &quot;feeders&quot;, which is designed to contain and release groundbaits to help attract fish towards the hook.

==== Lure fishing ====

Lure fishing uses a type of artificial fake bait known as &quot;lure&quot;, which is usually made from inedible materials such as wood, metal and plastics. Unlike conventional fishing baits, lures do not emit any scent and thus cannot attract fish olfactorily, but instead using prey-like appearances, movements, vibrations, bright reflections and flashy colors to attract and entice carnivorous predatory fish into mistakenly striking. Many lures are equipped with more than one hooks to better the chance of anchoring into the fish&#x27;s mouth, though some hookless lures are used to bait the fish nearer so it can be captured via other means such as spearing, netting/trapping or capturing by hand. In addition to rod angling, handlining, longlining and commercial trolling also employ lure fishing.

Lure fishing is a popular style of recreational fishing. When fishing, a lure angler will repeatedly cast out the lure afar and then methodically retrieves the line, pulling the lure through the water and creating vibrations, turbulent splashes and/or a popping action in the process, which imitating a small aquatic prey such as a baitfish, a drowning insect or a frog. A skilled angler can explore many possible hiding spots for fish through lure casting such as under logs and on flats. No bite indicator is used, and when the lure catches the attention of a game fish and successfully results in biting/swallowing of the lure, the angler can detect it by watching for splashes and feeling any vibrations, rod bending and changes in line tension. Lure fishing also typically uses relatively lightweight fishing rods coupled with baitcasting reels or spinning reels.

Depending on the style of lure retrieval, lure fishing can roughly be separated into &quot;power fishing&quot;, which relies on more frequent and vigorous lure retrievals to increase the chance of luring fish; and &quot;finesse fishing&quot;, which focuses on the more lingered and vivid lure presentation within &quot;each&quot; cast-retrieval cycle to better entice fish.

==== Rod trolling ====
Rod trolling is basically a simplified version of commercial trolling (see below), with fishing rods functioning as improvised outriggers to tow the baits/lures through the water, usually behind or beside a moving boat with the rod fixated to the gunwale. It can also be done by very slowly winding the line in (like &quot;finesse&quot;-type lure fishing) or even sweeping the line sideways, with the angler operating the rod from a static position (e.g. atop a jetty, pier or bridge).

A variation of trolling is &quot;drift fishing&quot;, which is usually done from an unpowered boat in faster-flowing waters. The line is not actively reeled, and the bait/lure is allowed to drift and react freely to the turbulences in the water current, much like how a tethered kite would behave in a wind gust.

=== Line fishing ===
Although all angling techniques use hook and line, the term &quot;line fishing&quot; specifically refers to those that do not involve using fishing rods.

==== Handlining ====

Handlining is angling with a handheld fishing line, baited with lures or bait fish just like normal rod angling. Handlining is the oldest angling technique used by mankind, and can be done from boats or from the shore. It is used mainly to catch groundfish and squid, but smaller pelagic fish can also be caught.

==== Deadlining ====
Deadlining is the practice of leaving a baited handline in the water (with the other end fastened to the bank) and returning later (usually overnight) to check and capture any tethered fish, similar to the use of a snare trap by hunters.

==== Longlining ====

Longlining is a commercial fishing technique that uses a long heavy line with a series of hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line via branch lines called &quot;snoods&quot;. Longlines are usually operated from specialised boats called &quot;longliners&quot;, which use a special winch to haul in the line and can operate in deeper waters targeting pelagic species such as swordfish, tuna, halibut and sablefish.

==== Droplining ====

Droplining involves setting a longline vertically down into the water (instead of being more horizontally deployed like longlining) with a series of baited hooks. Droplines are weighted at the bottom and have a float at the top. They are not usually as long as longlines and have fewer hooks, and tend to be stationary.

==== Trotlining====

Trotlining uses a longline that, instead of being tethered to the water surface only at one end, are fixed at/near the surface at both ends of the longline, with hooked snood lines hanging vertically down along the main line. Trotlines are used for catching crabs or fish (e.g. catfish), particularly across rivers. They can be physically set in many ways, such as tying each end to a fixed structure and span the line across the water in-between like a boom, and adjusting rest of the line with weights and floats.

==== Slabbing ====

Slabbing is a bass fishing technique that resembles jigging, and involves repetitively lifting and dropping a flat lure, usually made of 1 to 2.5 oz of lead painted to look like a baitfish (or heavy slabs of metal), through a school of actively feeding fish that the angler has located on a fishfinder. It is used on white and striped bass in the reservoirs of the southern US.

==== Trolling====

Rodless trolling is typically used in commercial fishing, with one or more baited lines drawn through the water behind a slow moving fishing boat that is usually equipped with outriggers, downriggers and trolling motors. Trolling is used to catch economic pelagic fish such as mackerel and kingfish.

&quot;Pahila&quot; (literally meaning &quot;pulled&quot;) is a Filipino traditional shoreline trolling, uniquely using baited hooks tied to a laterally flattened float called &quot;palyaw&quot;, which is shaped like a small outrigger boat, a catamaran or a fish. A longline is attached to the float, and set unto the water&#x27;s edge and dragged by someone running or walking along the beach. The combination of the water resistance and the diagonal pull forces the float outwards into deeper waters, like a kite. Once the line reaches its maximum line length, it moves rapidly parallel to the person pulling it along the beach, and is pulled back to the shore intermittently to check for catches. It is also called , , , , hilada, or , among other names, in other Philippine languages.

== Laws and regulations ==
Laws and regulations managing angling vary greatly, often regionally, within countries. These commonly include permits (licences), closed periods (seasons) where specific species are unavailable for harvest, restrictions on gear types, and quotas.

Laws generally prohibit catching fish with hooks other than in the mouth (i.e. snagging, or &quot;foul hooking&quot; and &quot;jagging&quot;) or the use of nets and hand hooks other than as an aid in landing a captured fish. Some species, such as bait fish, may be taken with nets, and a few for food. Sometimes, non-sport fish are considered of lesser value and it may be permissible to take them by methods like snagging, bow and arrow or spearing, none of which fall under the definition of angling since they do not rely upon the use of a hook and line.

===Fishing seasons===

Fishing seasons are set by countries or localities to indicate what kinds of fish may be caught during sport fishing (also known as angling) for a certain period of time. Fishing seasons are enforced (usually by water police) to maintain ecological balance and to protect species of fish during their spawning period during which they are easier to catch and more physiologically vulnerable.

=== Slot limits ===

Slot limits prohibit the harvest of fish where the measured lengths (from the snout to the end of the tail fin) fall within a protected interval. These are put in action to help protect certain fish (usually juvenile) in a given area. They generally require anglers to release captured fish if they fall within a given size range, allowing anglers to keep only smaller (though rare) or larger fish. Slot limits vary from water to water depending on what local officials believe would produce the best outcome for managing fish populations.

Individual fishing quota (IFQ), also known as individual transferable quota (ITQ), is a kind of &quot;catch share&quot; that sets a species-specific total allowable catch (TAC), typically by weight and for a given time period. A dedicated portion of the TAC (called &quot;quota share&quot;) is then allocated to individual fishermen, and can typically be transferable (i.e. bought, sold or leased). As of 2008, 148 major fisheries (generally, a single species in a single fishing ground) around the world had adopted some variant of this approach, along with approximately 100 smaller fisheries in individual countries. Approximately 10% of the marine harvest was managed by ITQs as of 2008. The first countries to adopt individual fishing quotas were the Netherlands, Iceland and Canada in the late 1970s, and the most recent is the United States Scallop General Category IFQ Program in 2010 The first country to adopt individual transferable quotas as a national policy was New Zealand in 1986.

=== Minimum landing size ===

The minimum landing size (MLS) is the smallest fish measurement at which it is legal for the fisherman to keep a captured fish. The MLS depends on the species of fish, and allowed sizes also vary around the world, as they are legal definitions which are defined by the local regulatory authority.

The idea behind this limitation is that only the older, more mature adult fish get taken, leaving growing juveniles behind to continue breeding and propagating their species. There is some criticism of this legal requirement, however, as it applies artificial selection pressure to the fish population (see Fisheries-induced evolution) unless the anglers voluntarily practise catch and release indiscriminate of sizes. As larger fish (whose survival has been more successful so far) get taken out of the population, the genes for larger size are reduced or removed from the gene pool, while fish that mature at a smaller size survive longer to continue breeding, and the average size of fish stock shrinks over time. This has led to a collapse in the amount of catchable fish in some fisheries.

== Catch and release ==


Although most anglers keep their catch for consumption, catch and release fishing is increasingly practiced, especially by fly anglers. The general principle is that releasing fish allows them to survive, thus avoiding unintended depletion of the population. For species such as marlin, muskellunge, and bass, there is a cultural taboo among anglers against taking them for food. In many parts of the world, size limits apply to certain species, meaning fish below a certain size must, by law, be released. It is generally believed that larger fish have a greater breeding potential. Some fisheries have a slot limit that allows the taking of smaller and larger fish, but requiring that intermediate sized fish be released. It is generally accepted that this management approach will help the fishery create a number of large, trophy-sized fish. In smaller fisheries that are heavily fished, catch and release is the only way to ensure that catchable fish will be available from year to year.
The practice of catch and release is criticised by some who consider it unethical to inflict pain upon a fish for purposes of sport. Some of those who object to releasing fish do not object to killing fish for food. Adherents of catch and release dispute this charge, pointing out that fish commonly feed on hard and spiky prey items, and as such can be expected to have tough mouths, and also that some fish will re-take a lure they have just been hooked on, a behaviour that is unlikely if hooking were painful. Opponents of catch and release fishing would find it preferable to ban or to severely restrict angling. On the other hand, proponents state that catch-and-release is necessary for many fisheries to remain sustainable, is a practice that generally has high survival rates, and consider the banning of angling as not reasonable or necessary.

In some jurisdictions, in the Canadian province of Manitoba, for example, catch and release is mandatory for some species such as brook trout. Many of the jurisdictions which mandate the live release of sport fish also require the use of artificial lures and barbless hooks to minimise the chance of injury to fish. Mandatory catch and release also exists in the Republic of Ireland where it was introduced as a conservation measure to prevent the decline of Atlantic salmon stocks on some rivers. In Switzerland, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and was banned in September 2008.

Barbless hooks, which can be created from a standard hook by removing the barb with pliers or can be bought, are sometimes resisted by anglers because they believe that increased fish escapes. Barbless hooks reduce handling time, thereby increasing survival. Concentrating on keeping the line taut while fighting fish, using recurved point or &quot;triple grip&quot; style hooks on lures, and equipping lures that do not have them with split rings can significantly reduce escapement.

==Tournaments and derbies==

Angling is also practiced in fishing tournaments, where contestants compete for prizes based on the total length or weight of a fish, usually of a pre-determined species, caught within a specified time. These contests originated as local fishing contests and have evolved to include large competitive circuits, with professional anglers that are supported by commercial endorsements. Professional anglers may gain cash prizes for placing well in tournaments. Similar competitive fishing exists at the amateur level with fishing derbies. In general, derbies can be distinguished from tournaments; derbies normally require fish to be killed, as opposed to tournaments, where points are normally deducted if fish can not be released alive.

==Motivation==
A ten-year-long survey of US fishing club members, completed in 1997, indicated that motivations for recreational angling have shifted from personal leisure, outdoor exercise, experiencing nature and thrill of the catch, to the importance of family time and social bonding via recreational fishing. Anglers with higher family incomes went fishing more frequently and were less concerned about obtaining fish as food.

A German study indicated that satisfaction derived from angling was not dependent on the actual catch, but depended more on the angler&#x27;s expectations of the experience.

A 2006 study by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries tracked the motivations of anglers on the Red River. Among the most often stated responses were the fun of catching fish, the experience, to catch a lot of fish or a very large fish, for challenge, and adventure. Use as food was not investigated as a motive.

<text>General Thomas Gage (10 March 1718/192 April 1787) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator best known for his many years of service in North America, including serving as Commander-in-Chief, North America during the early days of the American Revolution.

Being born into an aristocratic family in England, he entered the Army and saw action in the French and Indian War, where Gage served alongside his future opponent George Washington in the 1755 Battle of the Monongahela. After the successful Montreal campaign in 1760, he was named military governor of the region. During this time Gage did not distinguish himself militarily, but proved himself to be a competent administrator.

From 1763 to 1775, he served as commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, overseeing Britain&#x27;s response to the outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War in 1763. In 1774, Gage was also appointed the military governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, with instructions to implement the Intolerable Acts, punishing Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party. His attempts to seize the military stores of Patriot militias in April 1775 sparked the battles of Lexington and Concord, beginning the American War of Independence. After Britain&#x27;s pyrrhic victory in the Battle of Bunker Hill in June, he was replaced by General William Howe in October 1775, and returned to England where he died in 1787.

==Early life==
Thomas Gage was born on 10 March 1718/19 at Firle and christened 31 March 1719 at Westminster St James, Middlesex, England, son of Thomas Gage, 1st Viscount Gage, and Benedicta Maria Teresa Hall. Firle Place, Firle, Sussex, is where the Gage family had been seated since the 15th century. His father, Thomas Gage, 1st Viscount Gage, was a noted nobleman given titles in Ireland. Thomas Gage (the elder) had three children, of whom Thomas was the second. The first son, William Hall Gage, 2nd Viscount Gage, was born 6 January 1717/18 and christened 29 January 1717/18, also at Westminster St James. In 1728 Gage began attending the prestigious Westminster School where he met such figures as John Burgoyne, Richard Howe, Francis Bernard, and George Germain. Despite the family&#x27;s long history of Catholicism, Viscount Gage had adopted the Anglican Church in 1715. During his school years Thomas the younger became firmly attached to the latter church; he eventually developed a dislike for the Roman Catholic Church that became evident in later years.

After he left Westminster School in 1736, there are no records of Gage&#x27;s activities until he joined the British Army, eventually receiving a commission as ensign. His early duties consisted of recruiting in Yorkshire. In January 1741 he purchased a lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the 1st Northampton Regiment, where he stayed until May 1742, when he transferred to Battereau&#x27;s Regiment with the rank of captain-lieutenant. Gage received promotion to captain in 1743, and saw action in the War of the Austrian Succession with British forces in Flanders, where he served as aide-de-camp to the Earl of Albemarle in the Battle of Fontenoy. He saw further service in the Second Jacobite Uprising, which culminated in the 1746 Battle of Culloden. From 1747 to 1748, Gage saw action under Albemarle in the Low Countries. In 1748 he purchased a major&#x27;s commission and transferred to the 55th Foot Regiment (which was later renumbered to the 44th). The regiment was stationed in Ireland from 1748 to 1755; Gage was promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1751.

During his early service years, he spent leisure time at White&#x27;s Club, where he was a member, and occasionally travelled, going at least as far as Paris. He was a popular figure in the army and at the club, even though he neither liked alcohol nor gambled very much. His friendships spanned class and ability. Charles Lee once wrote to Gage, &quot;I respected your understanding, lik&#x27;d your manners and perfectly ador&#x27;d the qualities of your heart.&quot; Gage also made some important political connections, forming relationships with important figures like Lord Barrington, the future Secretary at War, and Jeffery Amherst, a man roughly his age who rose to great heights in the French and Indian War.

In 1750, Gage became engaged to a &quot;lady of rank and fortune, whom he persuaded to yield her hand in an honourable way&quot;. The engagement was eventually broken, leaving Gage broken-hearted. In 1753, both Gage and his father stood for seats in Parliament. Both lost in the April 1754 election, even though his father had been a Member of Parliament for some years prior. They both contested the results, but his father died soon after, and Gage withdrew his protest in early 1755, as his regiment was being sent to America following the outbreak of the French and Indian War.

==French and Indian War==

In 1755 Gage&#x27;s regiment was sent to North America as part of General Edward Braddock&#x27;s expeditionary force, whose objective was the expulsion of French forces from the Ohio Country, territory disputed between French and British colonies where there had been military clashes in 1754. On this expedition Gage&#x27;s regiment was in the vanguard of the troops when they came upon a company of French and First Nations people who were trying to set up an ambush. This skirmish began the Battle of the Monongahela, in which Braddock was mortally wounded, and George Washington distinguished himself for his courage under fire and his leadership in organising the retreat. The commander of the 44th, Colonel Sir Peter Halkett, was one of many officers killed in the battle and Gage, who temporarily took command of the regiment, was slightly wounded. The regiment was decimated, and Captain Robert Orme (General Braddock&#x27;s aide-de-camp) levelled charges that poor field tactics on the part of Gage had led to the defeat; as a result of his accusations Gage was denied permanent command of the 44th Regiment. Gage and Washington maintained a somewhat friendly relationship for several years after the expedition, but distance and lack of frequent contact likely cooled the relationship. By 1770, Washington was publicly condemning Gage&#x27;s actions in asserting British authority in Massachusetts.

===Creation of the light infantry===
In the summer of 1756 Gage served as second-in-command of a failed expedition to resupply Fort Oswego, which fell to the French while the expedition was en route. The following year, he was assigned to Captain-General John Campbell Loudoun in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where a planned expedition against Louisbourg turned back when confronted by a larger French fleet.
In December 1757, Gage proposed to Loudoun the creation of a regiment of light infantry that would be better suited to woodland warfare. Loudoun approved the plan before he was recalled that month, also recommending Gage to the king for promotion to full colonel. Gage spent the winter in New Jersey, recruiting for the newly raised 80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot, the &quot;first definitely light-armed regiment in the British army.&quot; While it is uncertain exactly when he met the Kembles, his choice of the Brunswick area may well have been motivated by his interest in Margaret Kemble, a well-known beauty of the area, a descendant of the Schuyler family, and the granddaughter of New York Mayor Stephanus Van Cortlandt. Recruiting and courtship were both successful. By February 1758 Gage was in Albany, preparing for that year&#x27;s campaign, and he and Margaret were married on 8 December of that year.

The campaign for which Gage went to Albany culminated in the disastrous Battle of Carillon, in which 16,000 British forces were defeated by barely 4,000 French forces. Gage, whose regiment was in the British vanguard, was again wounded in that battle, in which the British suffered more than 2,000 casualties. Gage, who had been brevetted a brigadier general for the 1758 campaign, received in 1759 a full promotion to the position, largely through the political manoeuvring of his brother, Lord Gage.

===Failure to act against La Galette===

The new brigadier general was placed in command of the Albany post, serving under Major General Jeffery Amherst. In 1759, shortly after capturing Ticonderoga without a fight, General Amherst learned of the death of General John Prideaux whose expedition had captured Fort Niagara. Amherst then ordered Gage to take Prideaux&#x27;s place, and to take Fort de La Présentation (also known as Fort La Galette) at the mouth of the Oswegatchie River on Lake Ontario. When Amherst learned that the French had also abandoned Fort St. Frédéric, he sent a messenger after Gage with more explicit instructions to capture La Galette and then, if at all possible, to advance on Montreal.

When Gage arrived at Oswego, which had been captured in July by troops under Frederick Haldimand&#x27;s command, he surveyed the situation, and decided that it was not prudent to move against La Galette. Expected reinforcements from Fort Duquesne had not arrived, the French military strength at La Galette was unknown, and its strength near Montreal was believed to be relatively high. Gage, believing an attack on La Galette would not gain any significant advantage, decided against action, and sent Amherst a message outlining his reasons. Although there was no immediate censure from either Amherst or the government, Amherst was incensed at the failure, and Gage&#x27;s troops were in the rear of Amherst&#x27;s army in the 1760 expedition that resulted in Montreal&#x27;s surrender.

==Early governorship==
After the French surrender, Amherst named Gage the military Governor of Montreal, a task Gage found somewhat thankless, because it involved the minute details of municipal governance along with the administration of the military occupation. He was also forced to deal with civil litigation, and manage trade with the First Nations in the Great Lakes region, where traders disputed territorial claims, and quarrelled with the First Nations. Margaret came to stay with him in Montreal and that is where his first two children, Harry, the future 3rd Viscount Gage, and Maria Theresa, were born. In 1761, he was promoted to major general, and in 1762, again with the assistance of his brother, was placed in command of the 22nd Regiment, which assured a command even in peacetime.

By all accounts, Gage appeared to be a fair administrator, respecting people&#x27;s lives and property, although he had a healthy distrust of the landowning seigneurs and of the Roman Catholic clergy, who he viewed as intriguers for the French. When peace was announced following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Gage began lobbying for another posting, as he was &quot;very much [tired] of this cursed Climate, and I must be bribed very high to stay here any longer&quot;. In October 1763 the good news arrived that he would act as commander-in-chief of North America while Amherst was on leave in Britain. He immediately left Montreal, and took over Amherst&#x27;s command in New York on 17 November 1763. When he did so, he inherited the job of dealing with the outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War.

===Pontiac&#x27;s War===
Following the conquest of New France, Amherst, who had little respect for the First Nations, instituted policies that severely hampered Anglo-Indian relations, principally forbidding the sale of ammunition to them. Combined with widespread concern about British expansion into their territories, this prompted the tribes of the Ohio Country and the formerly French &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; to rise against the British. In May 1763, under the leadership of the Odawa leader Pontiac, they launched a series of attacks on lightly garrisoned British frontier forts, successfully driving the British from some, threatening others, and also terrorising British settlers in those areas.

Hoping to end the conflict diplomatically, Gage ordered Colonel John Bradstreet and Colonel Henry Bouquet out on military expeditions and also ordered Sir William Johnson to engage in peace negotiations. Johnson negotiated the Treaty of Fort Niagara in the summer of 1764 with some of the disaffected tribes, and Colonel Bouquet negotiated a cease-fire of sorts in October 1764, which resulted in another peace treaty finalised by Johnson in 1765. In 1765, the 42nd Regiment of Foot finally got through to Fort Cavendish, the last fort still in French hands. The conflict was not fully resolved until Pontiac himself travelled to Fort Ontario and signed a formal treaty with Johnson in July 1766.

===Securing his position===
When General Amherst left North America in 1763, it was on a leave of absence from his position as commander-in-chief. In 1764, Amherst announced that he had no intention of returning to North America, at which point Gage&#x27;s appointment to that post was made permanent. (Amherst retained posts as governor of Virginia and colonel of the 60th Foot, positions he only gave up in 1768 when he was required to actually go to Virginia or give up the post.) Intrigues of other high-ranking officers, especially Robert Monckton and his supporters, for his offices, continued throughout his tenure as commander-in-chief. Gage was promoted to lieutenant general in 1771. In 1767 Gage ordered the arrest of Major Robert Rogers, the former leader of Rogers&#x27; Rangers who Gage had come to dislike and distrust during the war. The arrest was based on flimsy evidence that Rogers might have been engaging in a treasonous relationship with the French; he was acquitted in a 1768 court martial.

Gage spent most of his time as commander-in-chief, the most powerful office in British America, in and around New York City. Although Gage was burdened by the administrative demands of managing a territory that spanned the entirety of North America east of the Mississippi River, the Gages clearly relished life in New York, actively participating in the social scene. One way he did this was by joining the American Philosophical Society in 1768 through his election. Although his position gave him the opportunity to make financial arrangements that might have lined the pockets of high-ranking officers at the expense of the military purse, there is little evidence that he engaged in any significant improper transactions. In addition to the handsome sum of £10 per day as commander-in-chief, he received a variety of other stipends, including his colonel&#x27;s salary, given for leading his regiment. These funds made it possible to send all of the Gage children (at least six of whom survived to adulthood) to school in England.

If Gage did not dip his hand unnecessarily in the public till, he did engage in the relatively common practices of nepotism and political favouritism. In addition to securing advantageous positions for several people named Gage or Kemble, he also apparently assisted in the placement of some of his friends and political supporters, or their children.

===Rising colonial tension===
During Gage&#x27;s administration, political tensions rose throughout the American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing troops from the frontier to fortify urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, the need to provide adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.

Gage&#x27;s thoughts on the reasons for colonial unrest played an important role in furthering the unrest. He at first believed that the popular unrest after the 1765 Stamp Act was primarily due to a small number of colonial elites, led by those in Boston. In 1768 he recommended the deployment of two regiments to occupy Boston, a move that further inflamed the city. Among the troops quartered in the city was the 29th Regiment of Foot, which had previously clashed with colonists in Quebec and New York, and had a reputation for poor discipline. This occupation eventually led to the Boston Massacre in 1770. Later that year he wrote that &quot;America is a mere bully, from one end to the other, and the Bostonians by far the greatest bullies.&quot;

Gage later came to change his opinion about the source of the unrest, believing that democracy was a significant threat. He saw the movement of colonists into the interior, beyond effective Crown control, and the development of the town meeting as a means of local governance as major elements of the threat, and wrote in 1772 that &quot;democracy is too prevalent in America&quot;. He believed that town meetings should be abolished and recommended that colonisation should be limited to the coastal areas where British rule could be enforced.

==Governor of Massachusetts Bay==
Gage returned to Britain in June 1773 with his family and thus missed the Boston Tea Party in December of that year. The British Parliament reacted to the Tea Party with a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts known in the colonies as the Intolerable Acts. Some of the terms of those acts, for example the option to remove political trials to England, originated with Gage, and measures such as curbing the activities of town meetings and withholding representative government from the Ohio Country also show his influence. With his military experience and relative youth (Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson was then 62 years old and unpopular, and the equally unpopular lieutenant governor Andrew Oliver was 67 in 1773 and died in March 1774), Gage, a popular figure on both sides of the Atlantic, was deemed the best man to handle the brewing crisis and enforce the Parliamentary acts.
In early 1774, he was appointed military governor of Massachusetts, replacing Hutchinson. He arrived from Britain in early May, first stopping at Castle William on Castle Island in Boston Harbour. He then arrived in Boston on 13 May 1774, having been carried there by . His arrival was met with little pomp and circumstance, but was generally well received at first as Bostonians were happy to see Hutchinson go. Local attitudes toward him rapidly deteriorated as he began implementing the various acts, including the Boston Port Act, which put many people out of work, and the Massachusetts Government Act, which formally rescinded the provincial assembly&#x27;s right to nominate members of the Governor&#x27;s Council, though it retained the elected General Court. Gage dissolved the assembly in June 1774 after he discovered the Massachusetts representatives were sending delegates to the extralegal Continental Congress. He called for new elections to be held as per the Massachusetts Government Act, but his authority was undermined by the representatives who refused to meet with the new, appointed Governor&#x27;s Council. He attempted to buy off political leaders in Massachusetts, notably Benjamin Church and Samuel Adams. With the former he was successful—Church secretly supplied him with intelligence on the activities of rebel leaders—but Adams and other rebel leaders were not moved.

In September 1774 Gage withdrew his garrisons from New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Halifax and Newfoundland and brought all under his wing in Boston together with a large British naval presence under the control of Admiral Samuel Graves. He also sought to strictly enforce army directives calling for the confiscation of war-making materials. In September 1774, he ordered a mission to remove provincial gunpowder from a magazine in what is now Somerville, Massachusetts. This action, although successful, caused a huge popular reaction known as the Powder Alarm, resulting in the mobilization of thousands of provincial militiamen who marched towards Cambridge, Massachusetts. Although the militia soon dispersed, the show of force on the part of the provincials had a lasting effect on Gage, and he subsequently grew more cautious in his actions. The rapid response of the provincials was in large part due to Paul Revere and the Sons of Liberty. The Sons of Liberty kept careful watch over Gage&#x27;s activities and successfully warned others of future actions before Gage could mobilise his British regulars to execute them. A Committee of Safety was also tasked with sounding the alarm for local militias if Gage were spotted sending significant numbers of British troops outside of Boston.

Gage was criticised for allowing groups like the Sons of Liberty to exist. One of his officers, Lord Percy, remarked, &quot;The general&#x27;s great lenity and moderation serve only to make them [the colonists] more daring and insolent.&quot; Gage himself wrote after the Powder Alarm, &quot;If force is to be used at length, it must be a considerable one, and foreign troops must be hired, for to begin with small numbers will encourage resistance, and not terrify; and will in the end cost more blood and treasure.&quot; Edmund Burke described Gage&#x27;s conflicted relationship by saying in Parliament, &quot;An Englishman is the unfittest person on Earth to argue another Englishman into slavery.&quot;

==American War of Independence==
On 14 April 1775 Gage received orders from London to take decisive action against the Patriots. Given intelligence that the militia had been stockpiling weapons at Concord, Massachusetts, he ordered detachments of regulars from the Boston garrison to march there on the night of 18 April to confiscate them. A brief skirmish in Lexington scattered colonial militia forces gathered there, but in a later standoff in Concord, a portion of the British force was routed by a stronger colonial militia contingent. When the British left Concord following their search (which was largely unsuccessful, as the colonists, with advance warning of the action, had removed most of the supplies), arriving colonial militia engaged the British column in a running battle back to Charlestown. The Battles of Lexington and Concord resulted in 273 total casualties for the British and 93 for the American rebels.

The British expedition to Lexington and Concord was supposed to have been a &quot;profound secret,&quot; but nevertheless Sons of Liberty leader Joseph Warren found out about it. He then dispatched Paul Revere and William Dawes to warn the colonists, which resulted in the Battle of Lexington and Concord, and starting the American War of Independence. Gage had told his plans to only his second-in-command and &quot;one other person.&quot; There is evidence to suggest that the other person was his wife, Margaret Kemble Gage, who was an American, and that she may have passed on this information to Warren.

Following Lexington and Concord, thousands of colonial militia surrounded the city, beginning the Siege of Boston. At first, the rebels (led mainly by Massachusetts General Artemas Ward) faced some 4,000 British regulars, who were bottled up in the city. British Admiral Samuel Graves commanded the fleet that continued to control the harbour. On 25 May, 4,500 reinforcements arrived in the city, along with three more generals: Major General William Howe and Brigadiers John Burgoyne and Henry Clinton.

On 14 June, Gage issued a proclamation, believed to have been written by Burgoyne but distributed in Gage&#x27;s name, granting a general pardon to all who would demonstrate loyalty to the crown—with the notable exceptions of John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Gage also worked with the newly arrived generals on a plan to break the grip of the besieging forces. They would use an amphibious assault to take control of the unoccupied Dorchester Heights, which would be followed up by an attack on the rebel camp at Roxbury. They would then seize the heights on the Charlestown peninsula, including Breed&#x27;s Hill and Bunker Hill. This would allow the British to eventually take the colonial headquarters at Cambridge. The colonists were warned of these plans, and seized the initiative. On the night of 16–17 June, they fortified Breed&#x27;s Hill, threatening the British position in Boston. On 17 June 1775, British forces under General Howe seized the Charlestown Peninsula at the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was a Pyrrhic victory; Britain won but suffered more than 1,000 casualties without significantly altering the state of the siege. Henry Clinton called it &quot;[a] dear bought victory, another such would have ruined us&quot;, while other officers noted that nothing had been gained in the victory. Gage himself wrote the Secretary at War:

These people show a spirit and conduct against us they never showed against the French... They are now spirited up by a rage and enthusiasm as great as ever people were possessed of and you must proceed in earnest or give the business up. A small body acting in one spot will not avail, you must have large armies making diversions on different sides, to divide their force. The loss we have sustained is greater than we can bear. Small armies cannot afford such losses, especially when the advantage gained tends to do little more than the gaining of a post.

==Return to Great Britain==
On 25 June 1775, Gage wrote a dispatch to Great Britain, notifying Lord Dartmouth of the results of the battle on 17 June. Three days after his report arrived in England, Dartmouth issued the order recalling Gage and replacing him with William Howe. The rapidity of this action is likely attributable to the fact that people within the government were already arguing for Gage&#x27;s removal, and the battle was just the final straw. Gage received the order in Boston on 26 September, and set sail for England on 11 October.

The nature of Dartmouth&#x27;s recall order did not actually strip Gage of his offices immediately. William Howe temporarily replaced him as commander of the forces in Boston, while General Guy Carleton was given command of the forces in Quebec. Although King George wanted to reward his &quot;mild general&quot; for his service, Gage&#x27;s sole reward after Lord George Germain (who succeeded Dartmouth as the Secretary of State for North America) formally gave his command to Howe in April 1776 was that he retained the governorship of Massachusetts.

On the Gages&#x27; return to England, the family eventually settled into a house on Portland Place in London. Although he was presumably given a friendly reception in his interview with a sympathetic King George, the public and private writings about him and his fall from power were at times vicious. One correspondent wrote that Gage had &quot;run his race of glory ... let him alone to the hell of his own conscience and the infamy which must inevitably attend him!&quot; Others were kinder; New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth characterised him as &quot;a good and wise man ... surrounded by difficulties.&quot;

Gage was briefly reactivated to duty in April 1781, when Amherst appointed him to mobilise troops for a possible French invasion. The next year, Gage assumed command of the 17th Light Dragoons. He was promoted to full general on 20 November 1782, and later transferred to command the 11th Dragoons.

==Final years and legacy==
As the war machinery was reduced in the mid-1780s, Gage&#x27;s military activities declined. He supported the efforts of Loyalists to recover losses incurred when they were forced to leave the colonies, notably confirming the activities of Benjamin Church to further his widow&#x27;s claims for compensation. He received visitors at Portland Place and at Firle, including Frederick Haldimand and Thomas Hutchinson. His health began to decline early in the 1780s.

Gage died at Portland Place on 2 April 1787, and was buried in the family plot at Firle. His wife survived him by almost 37 years. His son Henry inherited the family title upon the death of Gage&#x27;s brother William, and became one of the wealthiest men in England. His youngest son, William Hall Gage, became an admiral of the fleet in the Royal Navy, and all three daughters married into well-known families.

Gagetown, New Brunswick was named in his honour; the Canadian Forces base CFB Gagetown consequently reflects his name.

In 1792, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, renamed the archipelago of islands in the mouth of the St. Lawrence River for the victorious generals of the Conquest of Canada: Wolfe Island, Amherst Island, Howe Island, Carleton Island, and Gage Island. The last is now known as Simcoe Island.

==In popular culture==

In the 2015 miniseries &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, Gage is portrayed by Marton Csokas.

<text>Steve Ignorant (born Steven Williams in 1957) is a singer and artist.

==Career==
Steve Ignorant was born in Stoke-on-Trent but grew up in Dagenham, East London. He later lived at Dial House, which since 1967 has been a self-sustaining anarchist-pacifist intentional community in Epping Forest, Essex; it was here where he met Penny Rimbaud, one of the founders of the Dial House project.

Ignorant and Rimbaud went on to co-found the anarcho-punk band Crass in 1977. After Crass stopped performing in 1984, he worked with other groups including Conflict, Schwartzeneggar, Stratford Mercenaries, and Current 93 as well as being an occasional solo performer.
He is also a sculptor, and has worked as a traditional Punch and Judy performer using the name Professor Ignorant. In recent years he has developed an interest in the history of traditional London music hall performance. Ignorant is vegetarian.

On 24 and 25 November 2007 he performed Crass&#x27;s entire &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot; live at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, backed by guest musicians. Other members of Crass were not involved in these concerts. &quot;I acknowledge and respect Steve&#x27;s right to do this&quot;, Rimbaud said, &quot;but I do regard it as a betrayal of the Crass ethos&quot;. Ignorant had a different view; &quot;I don&#x27;t have to justify what I do. (...) Plus, most of the lyrics are still relevant today. And remember that three-letter word, &#x27;fun&#x27;?&quot; He moved to the Norfolk coast in 2007 where he volunteers as a lifeboatman.
In 2010 Ignorant announced plans to do a tour called &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, performing Crass songs from the period 1977–1982 with largely the same band that performed with him at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, including Gizz Butt, Bob Butler and Spike Smith. In August 2010 Ignorant and Rimbaud took to the stage together to be interviewed by John Robb on the literacy stage at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool where they informed the large crowd that Rimbaud has now given him his blessing to perform Crass material live. In the same year Southern Records published &quot;The Rest Is Propaganda&quot;, Ignorant&#x27;s autobiography co-written with Steve Pottinger. On 19 November 2011, Ignorant performed &quot;The Last Supper&quot; at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire where he was joined on stage by Rimbaud and Eve Libertine. This was the last time Crass songs were performed live by him until his 2020 tour. In 2019, Ignorant announced plans to tour England in 2020 with a full band performing an all-Crass set. 
=== Slice of Life ===
While stranded in Sydney, Australia after a tour, Steve Ignorant, Carol Hodge and Pete Wilson came up with an idea for a new band, a more contemplative band backed by acoustic instruments. Thus Slice of Life was born. They performed for the first time at Wellingborough, UK on 25 October 2013. Lucas Martin joined the band on upright bass in 2015. Music publisher Wipeout Music says of the group, &quot;Steve opens both heart and soul when reflecting on life and then reminds us just why we should never give up on this world or on each other with his poems and songs that make us think about the world around us and reminds us just why we should still care.&quot; 

In March 2022 Steve Ignorant&#x27;s Slice of Life released an EP called &quot;The Kids Was Just Crass&quot; via the Stay Free Recordings label. It contains David Bowie cover versions.

The band has recorded several albums.

# Love and a Lamp Post (2014)
# Live at the Forum 2015 (2016)
# Don&#x27;t Turn Away (2019)
# Live at Ramsgate Music Hall (2020)

They also released an extended single, Just Another, in 2017.

<doc id="223430" wikidata="Q691991" url="?curid=223430" title="Monito del monte">
<text>The monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), or colocolo opossum, is a diminutive species of marsupial native only to south-western South America (Argentina and Chile). It is the only extant species in the ancient order Microbiotheria, and the sole New World representative of the superorder Australidelphia, being more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other American marsupials. The species is nocturnal and arboreal, and lives in thickets of South American mountain bamboo in the Valdivian temperate forests of the southern Andes, aided by its partially prehensile tail. It consumes an omnivorous diet based on insects and fruit.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
&quot;Dromiciops gliroides&quot; is the sole extant member of the order Microbiotheria. It was first described by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1894. The generic name &quot;Dromiciops&quot; is based on the resemblance of the monito del monte to the eastern pygmy possum (&quot;Cercartetus nanus&quot;), one of the synonyms of which is &quot;Dromicia nana&quot;. The specific name &quot;gliroides&quot; is a combination of the Latin &quot;glis, gliris&quot; (&quot;dormouse&quot;, more generally &quot;rodent&quot;) and Greek &quot;oides&quot; (&quot;similar to&quot;). The name &quot;australis&quot; in a synonym (&quot;D. australis&quot;) refers to the southern distribution of the animal. The common name monito del monte is Spanish for &quot;little monkey of the bush&quot;.

In his 1943 &quot;Mammals of Chile&quot;, American zoologist Wilfred Hudson Osgood identified two subspecies of the monito del monte:

*&quot;Dromiciops gliroides australis&quot; : It occurs in the Valdivian temperate rain forest in southcentral Chile.
*&quot;Dromiciops gliroides gliroides&quot; : It occurs in the northeastern Chiloé Island.

==Phylogeny and biogeography==

South American marsupials have long been suspected to be ancestral to those of Australia, consistent with the fact that the two continents were connected via Antarctica in the early Cenozoic. Australia&#x27;s earliest known marsupial is &quot;Djarthia&quot;, a primitive mouse-like animal that lived in the early Eocene about 55 million years ago (mya). &quot;Djarthia&quot; had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian, and this research suggested that the monito del monte was the last of a clade that included &quot;Djarthia&quot;. This relationship suggests that the ancestors of the monito del monte might have reached South America by back-migration from Australia. The time of divergence between the monito del monte and Australian marsupials was estimated to have been 46 mya.

&quot;Dromiciops&quot; is thought to have evolved from members of the genus &quot;Microbiotherium&quot;, known from the early Miocene of South America, with some authors considering the genera indistinguishable. All other genera, like &quot;Pachybiotherium&quot;, had become extinct by the late Miocene.

However, in 2010, analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials, while confirming the placement of the monito del monte in Australidelphia, also clarified that its lineage is the most basal of that superorder. The study further confirmed that the most basal of all marsupial orders are the other two South American lineages (Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata, with the former probably branching first). This conclusion indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America (along with the ancestors of all other living marsupials), and probably reached Australia in a single dispersal event after Microbiotheria split off. Fossils of another Eocene australidelphian, the microbiotherian &quot;Woodburnodon casei&quot;, have been described from the Antarctic Peninsula, and fossils of a related early Eocene woodburnodontid have been found in Patagonia.

==Habitat==
Monitos del monte live in the dense forests of highland Argentina and Chile, mainly in trees, where they construct spherical nests of water-resistant colihue leaves. These leaves are then lined with moss or grass, and placed in well-protected areas of the tree, such as underbrush, tree cavities, or fallen timber. The nests are sometimes covered with gray moss as a form of camouflage. These nests provide the monito del monte with some protection from cold, both when it is active and when it hibernates.

Fragmentation of Valdivian temperate rainforests into non-contiguous areas is known to reduce the abundance of monitos del monte in a given area, but has little or no impact on whether it occurs in an area or not.

==Morphology==
Monitos del monte are small marsupials that look like mice. &quot;Dromiciops&quot; have the same dental formula as &quot;Didelphids&quot;: , a total of 50 teeth. Their size ranges from . They have short and dense fur that is primarily brown-gray with patches of white at their shoulders and back, and their underside is more of a cream or light gray color. Monitos del monte also have distinct black rings around their eyes. Their small furred ears are well-rounded and their rostrums are short. The head to body length is around , and their tail length is between . Their tails are somewhat prehensile and mostly furred with the exception of of the underside. The naked underside of their tails may contribute to increasing friction when the mammal is on a tree. The base of their tails also functions as a fat storage organ which they use during winter hibernation. In a week, Monitos del monte can store enough fat to double their body size.

===Sexual dimorphism===

At the end of the summer, female monitos del monte tend to be larger and heavier than males. The tails of the sexes also vary in size during this time; females have a thicker tail, which is where they store fat; the difference suggests that females need more energy than males during hibernation. The sexual dimorphism is only seen during this time and not year-round.

==Reproduction==
Monitos del monte have a monogamous mating system. The females have well-formed, fur-lined pouch containing four teats. They normally reproduce in the spring once a year and can have a litter size varying from one to five. They can feed a maximum of four offspring, so if there are five young, one will not survive. When the young are mature enough to leave the pouch, approximately five months, they are nursed in a distinctive nest. They are then carried on the mother&#x27;s back. The young remain in association with the mother after weaning. Males and females both reach sexual maturity after two years.

==Habits==

The monito del monte is adapted to arboreal life; its tail and paws are prehensile. It is largely nocturnal and, depending on the ambient and internal temperature, and on the availability of food, it spends much of the day in a state of torpor. Such behaviour enables it to survive periods of extreme weather and food shortage, conserving energy instead of foraging to no effect.

The animal covers its nest with moss for concealment, and for insulation and protection from bad weather.

==Diet==
The monito del monte depends on consuming both insects and fruit, with either component individually being nutritionally unbalanced. Fruit consumed comes from 16 species of plant, with the mistletoe species &quot;Tristerix corymbosus&quot; being a preferred source of fruit. A study performed in the temperate forests of southern Argentina showed a mutualistic seed dispersal relationship between &quot;D. gliroides&quot; and &quot;Tristerix corymbosus.&quot; The monito del monte is the sole dispersal agent for this plant, and without it the plant would likely become extinct. The monito del monte eats the fruit of &quot;T. corymbosus&quot;, and germination takes place in the gut.

==Conservation==
For the past few years the number of &quot;Dromiciops&quot; has declined, and the species is now classified as &quot;near threatened&quot;. Many factors contribute to the decline:

The monito del monte is not the only organism which will be affected if it becomes endangered. &quot;Dromiciops&quot; illustrate parasite-host specificity with the tick &quot;Ixodes neuquenensis&quot;. This tick can only be found on the monito del monte, so it depends on the survival of this nearly endangered mammal. &quot;T. corymbosus&quot; also depends on the survival of this species, because without the seed dispersal agency of the monito del monte, it would not be able to reproduce.

Currently, there are minimal conservation efforts. Ecological studies are being conducted in the Chiloé Island that might help future conservation efforts. &quot;Dromiciops&quot; has been found in the Los Ruiles National Reserve and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, which are protected areas in Chile and the Nothofagus forest of Parque Nacional Los Alerces, Chubut, Southern Argentina.

<text>A skatepark, or skate park, is a purpose-built recreational environment made for skateboarding, BMX, scootering, and aggressive inline skating. A skatepark may contain half-pipes, handrails, funboxes, vert ramps, stairsets, quarter pipes, ledges, spine transfers, pyramids, banked ramps, full pipes, pools, bowls, snake runs, and any number of other objects.

==History== 
Most of the early skateparks were in the United States. The first skatepark in the world, Surf City, opened for business at 5140 East Speedway Road in Tucson, Arizona on September 3, 1965. Patti McGee, Women&#x27;s National Champion, attended the grand opening. The park had concrete ramps and was operated by Arizona Surf City Enterprises, Inc. A skatepark for skateboarders and skaters made of plywood ramps on a half-acre lot in Kelso, Washington, opened in April 1966. It was lighted for night use. California&#x27;s first, the Carlsbad Skatepark opened on March 3, 1976. The World Skateboard Championships were held here on April 10, 1977. It operated until 1979, when it was buried intact beneath a layer of dirt for more than two decades, before being destroyed in 2005. The current Carlsbad Skatepark is in a different location. The East Coast&#x27;s first skatepark, Ocean Bowl Skate Park, in Ocean City, Maryland, opened the first week of June, 1976. Due to time, wear, and the current needs of skaters, the old bowl and ramp were torn down in the Fall of 1997 and the new park opened in July 1998.
 The Sandy Hills Skate Park, in Lansdowne, Maryland, is the oldest operating municipal skate park in the United States. In 1999 the city of Hermosa Beach, California opened a small skatepark at the site of the first skateboard competition. The competition held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School (now a city museum) was organized by Dewey Weber across the street from his surf and skateboard shop. Makaha Skateboards was a sponsor of the competition. In 1987, an all wooden indoor skate park, called CT Bike, opened in Bristol, Connecticut . CT Bike is where Tony Hawk made his debut when he was a young boy on his first East Coast tour. Until its closing in 2022, the indoor skate park was operated by the same family who built the park despite a fire that threatening the park in 1988. As of 2022 the park is now permanently closed.

In more extreme climates, parks were built indoors, often using wood or metal. By the end of the 1970s, the popularity of skateboarding had waned, and the original parks of the era began to close. A downturn in the overall skateboard market in the 1980s, coupled with high liability insurance premiums, contributed to the demise of the first wave of skateparks. Some second-generation parks, such as Upland, California&#x27;s Pipeline, survived into the 1980s. However, few of the private parks of the 1970s remain, with the notable exception of Kona Skatepark in Jacksonville, Florida. However, many public parks of that era can still be found throughout Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

The modern skatepark designs of the Pacific Northwest can be traced back to Burnside Skatepark, a DIY &quot;barge build&quot; beneath the Burnside Bridge in Portland, Oregon. Skateboarders used an area populated primarily by the city&#x27;s &quot;undesirable elements&quot; to create a skatepark, building one section at a time. The process is called &quot;design/build&quot; (D/B), and is a characteristic of many skateparks today. The design/build process ensures that adjacent skatepark features are harmonious and rideable, allowing skateboarders to create endless &quot;lines&quot; to ride among the many features.

Skate parks, related obstacles/ramps and locations designed for extreme sport utilization have made their way into the media over time, such as with the aforementioned Burnside Skatepark being included in the movie Free Willy.

Public skateparks have had a resurgence in the US, made possible by legislation such as California&#x27;s 1998 law stating that skateboarding is an inherently &quot;Hazardous Recreational Activity&quot; (HRA), and therefore municipalities and their employees may not be held liable for claims of negligence resulting in skateboarders&#x27; injuries.

Street skating has blurred the line between skateparks and street spots. Some cities are starting to put in skate spots/plazas with features that would not have been classically designed for skateboarding, but can be skated by street skaters legally. In some instances, street spots that were not originally designed for skateboarding have been converted into sanctioned skate plazas.

There is also an emerging movement of making art and sculpture skate-able. This provides additional legal skate spots that blend well with other city art and landscape features. Skate-able art allows for the creation of thriving multi-use areas, as installations often become picturesque destinations for skaters and non-skaters alike.

==Types==
Unlike organized sports, like basketball or football, skateboarding has no set arena or rules and skateparks have no standard design template. Each skatepark is designed specifically to provide unique challenges to its users. There are, however, three main categories of skatepark design: bowl, street plaza and flow parks.

Bowl parks are designed to emulate and improve upon the pool skating experience. Skaters in bowl parks can move around the park without taking their feet off the board to push. The curved walls of bowls allow skaters to ride around and across the bowl in addition to the back and forth skating you might see on a traditional half pipe. Bowls and bowl parks come in an endless variety of shapes and sizes but most bowls are between 3&#x27; and 12’ deep.

Street plaza parks are the favorite of the vast majority of skaters and they are designed to emulate and improve upon the street skating experience. Obstacles in a street plaza are styled to look like natural street terrain such as stairs, railings, planters and benches. Skaters will push off with their feet to gain momentum in a street plaza. The first public outdoor skate plaza is the Vancouver Skate Plaza, built in 2004 by New Line Skateparks.

Flow parks (or Park style) combine elements of both bowl parks and street plazas. In a well designed flow park a skater can pump around the parks curved walls such as quarter pipes, pump bumps and bowl corners without taking their feet off to push. They can use that speed to hit street obstacles such as stairs, railings and benches.

Skateparks may be privately or publicly owned. Privately owned skateparks usually have admission fees, while publicly owned skateparks are generally free. Many privately owned skateparks are indoors, usually in warehouses, roller rinks or buildings with high ceilings, especially in areas with snowy winters. Public skateparks are usually outdoors.

Skatepark construction can be divided into two major categories — prefabricated and custom built concrete. Prefabricated parks can be made of wood, plastic, sheet metal, and concrete. Most are designed and built by playground equipment manufacturers who present these parks as a cost-effective alternative to custom-designed concrete skateparks. In reality, custom built concrete skateparks can be quite cost competitive with prefabricated skate ramps.

According to an editor of &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; magazine, concrete parks are now &quot;pretty much the industry standard&quot; as they require fewer repairs and less maintenance.

==Elements==
* Quarter pipe – Literal quarter of a pipe. There is usually a narrow metal rod running the length of the top edge; this is called the coping. There may also be a flat platform connected to it at the top; this is called the deck. Quarter pipes have &quot;transitions&quot; which is the size of the radius of the ramps riding surface.
* Half pipe – Two Quarter Pipes facing each other (half of a pipe). A smaller halfpipe that is less than 8–10 feet can be referred to as a &quot;mini ramp&quot;
* Bowl – a completely enclosed area of quarterpipes that curve in corners. The curve placement and opposing quarterpipe placement can manifest in any fashion.
* Deck – The flat elevated area used as a staging area above ramps and bowls.
* Spine – Two quarter pipes placed back to back, that do not contain a deck. Spines may exist in bowls and half-pipes
* Extension – extensions in quarter pipe or halfpipe ramps.
* Escalator – sloping increases or decreases in quarterpipe or halfpipe ramp.
* Flat – The flat lower areas between transitions, usually at grade.
* Vert wall – A vertical wall above, and sometimes slightly behind, a quarter pipe.
* Bank – These can vary in angle but are simply wedge ramps for traversing obstacles, i.e. elevated flats. They may contain curvature at the tops or on sides.
* Hip – Essentially two quarter pipes or banks forming an angle.
* Funbox – A combination of banks, flats, rails, kickers, etc. connected to each other to form mini gaps.
* Pyramid – Funbox-type ramp made from four banks put in a square pyramid shape, usually surrounding a flat.
* Launcher/Kicker – A curved bank a rider uses to launch into the air.
* Roll-in – A long sloping ramp used to gain speed.
* Step-up/Eurobox – A funbox type ramp consisting of a bank with a flat at the top and a second, higher flat after it; in other words a bank-to-flat setup with a section removed from the bank part.
* Wall-box – In an indoor skatepark, this is a funbox built against the wall of the park; in an outdoor skatepark, it is a funbox with a wall splitting it down the middle.
* Pool – Usually an actual swimming pool that has been drained out for skateboarding. 
* Foam Pit – A pile of foam pads to land safely into while learning tricks, usually found after a launch ramp.
* Flatbar – A rail set level with ground.
* Sloped rail – A rail set at an angle.
* Kinked rail – A rail with two flat sections, one higher than the other, and a sloped section in the middle connecting them.
* Stair – A simple staircase.
* Handrail – A rail going with a staircase, either extended from the staircase or off an adjacent wall
* Kidney bowl – a bowl roughly in the shape of a human kidney
* Egg bowl – a bowl shaped like an egg
* Cradle – Spherical bowl turned on its side, typically connected with a bowl. Enables inverted and over-vert carving

<text>Cam Fella (May 14, 1979 – May 9, 2001) was a bay pacing horse by Most Happy Fella out of Nan Cam by Bret Hanover. He was trained and driven originally by Doug Arthur and later by Pat Crowe. His best time for the mile was 1:53.1. Cam Fella was purchased as a 2-year-old by the two Norms, Norm Clements and Norm Faulkner. He earned the nickname &quot;The Pacing Machine&quot; in a career wherein he became the richest standardbred of all time.

==1981 season==
In 1981, as a two-year-old, Cam Fella won three of eleven starts and was sold to Norm Clements and Norm Faulkner for US$140,000 after winning the Valedictory series final in his final start for the year. He earned only $17,588 for the year.

==1982 season==
Cam Fella had won 12 of 14 starts for the year, including the Hopeful Pace and New Faces, before his first major win in the Cane Pace as a supplemental entry. In eliminations for the Meadowlands Pace, Cam Fella could finish only seventh and did not progress to the final. It was to be the last time in his career he did not finish in the first three placings.

Although he won the Cane Pace, he did not have an opportunity to take the Triple Crown as he was not eligible to start in the Little Brown Jug. In October he proved himself to be the top 3yo pacer in North America by winning the Messenger Stakes. In the first heat he tied the track record for 3yos, winning in 1.57 3/5, before beating Icarus Lobell and Soky&#x27;s Atom in the final heat in 1.59 after a mid-race duel with Little Brown Jug winner Merger. As in the Cane Pace, he was a supplemental entry to the Messenger. His final start for 1982 came in November when he won the Provincial Cup at Windsor Raceway in 1.55.4, which tied the track record for his age. It was his 28th win from 33 starts for the year. The track reported its highest attendance since Niatross started there in 1980 and strong wagering, which had become typical for a race night featuring Cam Fella.
He also won the Queen City Pace, Prix d&#x27;Été, Confederation Cup Pace and Sophomore Pace in Canada and time trialed in 1.54 at The Red Mile. The Prix d&#x27;Été was the richest race in Canada at the time. For his exploits Cam Fella was named Harness Horse of the Year in both Canada and the United States for a season in which he started 33 times for 28 wins and 2 second places and had earnings of $879,723.

==1983 season==
After a slow start to 1983, Cam Fella won two of three legs of the World Cup series at The Meadowlands, including a two-length win in the final in 1.55 on a wet track. Once Cam Fella began winning in 1983, he continued winning until the end of his career at season&#x27;s end by going on a 28-race unbeaten streak. During the streak he won the Graduate and Driscoll Finals at The Meadowlands, the Canadian Pacing Derby, American National, Stewart Fraser Memorial, Frank Ryan Memorial, Blue Bonnets Challenge, Gold Cup and all three legs of the US Pacing Championship. In the Summer Championship at The Meadowlands in July, It&#x27;s Fritz was given a strong chance of beating Cam Fella by bettors; however, Cam Fella won in 1.54.2, ending a five-race winning sequence for his opponent. His wins in the US Pacing Championship leg and American National both broke the Sportsman&#x27;s Park track record, and his win in the US Pacing Championship leg at Roosevelt Raceway set a track record of 1.56.2.
By the end of 1983, Cam Fella had won 30 of 36 starts for the year and was voted Harness Horse of the Year for a second time. His final start came at Greenwood Raceway, Toronto, in December. It was his 28th consecutive win.

==Stud career==
Cam Fella began stud duty in 1984 and had an illustrious career siring 1,002 foals who earned $106.7m in prize money. His offspring included such notable horses as Eternal Camnation, Presidential Ball, Precious Bunny, Cam&#x27;s Card Shark and Camluck, all of whom have been inducted into the Living Hall of Fame or elected as Hall of Fame Immortals, as well as $2m earners Goalie Jeff and Camtastic and fastest Standardbred of all time Cambest. He was the leading sire in North America in 1993 and 1995, and his son Camluck and grandson Bettor&#x27;s Delight (by Cam&#x27;s Card Shark) have both also been the leading sire.

Cam Fella was a ridgling, meaning he had only one descended testicle, and his stud career ended when he was gelded as a result of testicular cancer. Following his stud career, he was taken on a tour of racetracks to raise money for charity, drawing large crowds. He was euthanized on May 9, 2001. A small residential street in Toronto near the former Greenwood Raceway is named &quot;Cam Fella Lane&quot; in his honour.

<doc id="223438" wikidata="Q14196619" url="?curid=223438" title="Microbiotheria">
<text>Microbiotheria is an australidelphian marsupial order that encompasses two families, Microbiotheriidae and Woodburnodontidae, and is represented by only one extant species, the monito del monte, and a number of extinct species known from fossils in South America, Western Antarctica, and northeastern Australia.

Although once thought to be members of the order Didelphimorphia (the order that contains the Virginia opossum), an accumulation of both anatomical and genetic evidence in recent years has led to the conclusion that microbiotheres are not didelphids at all, but are instead most closely related to the Australasian marsupials; together, the microbiotheres and the Australian orders form the clade Australidelphia which are now thought to have first evolved in the South American region of Gondwana.

==Biogeography==
The oldest microbiothere currently recognised is &quot;Khasia cordillerensis&quot;, based on fossil teeth from Early Palaeocene deposits at Tiupampa, Bolivia. Numerous genera are known from various Palaeogene and Neogene fossil sites in South America. A number of possible microbiotheres, again represented by isolated teeth, have also been recovered from the Middle Eocene La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, Western Antarctica. Finally, several undescribed microbiotheres have been reported from the Early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna in northeastern Australia; if this is indeed the case, then these Australian fossils have important implications for understanding marsupial evolution and biogeography. The distant ancestors of the monito del monte, it is thought, remained in what is now South America while others entered Antarctica and eventually Australia during the time when all three continents were joined as part of Gondwana.

<doc id="223440" wikidata="Q212148" url="?curid=223440" title="Prelude (music)">
<text>A prelude ( or &quot;&quot;; ; ; ) is a short piece of music, the form of which may vary from piece to piece. While, during the Baroque era, for example, it may have served as an introduction to succeeding movements of a work that were usually longer and more complex, it may also have been a stand-alone piece of work during the Romantic era. It generally features a small number of rhythmic and melodic motifs that recur through the piece. Stylistically, the prelude is improvisatory in nature. The term may also refer to an overture, particularly to those seen in an opera or an oratorio.

==History==
The first preludes to be notated were organ pieces that were played to introduce church music, the earliest surviving examples being five brief &quot;praeambula&quot; in the Ileborgh Tablature of 1448. These were closely followed by freely composed preludes in an extemporary style for the lute and other Renaissance string instruments, which were originally used for warming up the fingers and checking the instrument&#x27;s tuning and sound quality, as in a group of pieces by Joan Ambrosio Dalza published in 1508 under the heading &quot;tastar de corde&quot; (in Italian, literally, &quot;testing of the strings&quot;).

Keyboard preludes started appearing in the 17th century in France: unmeasured preludes, in which the duration of each note is left to the performer, were used as introductory movements in harpsichord suites. Louis Couperin (c.1626–1661) was the first composer to embrace the genre, and harpsichord preludes were used until the first half of the 18th century by numerous composers including Jean-Henri d&#x27;Anglebert (1629–1691), Élisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre (1665–1729), François Couperin (1668–1733) and Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764), whose very first printed piece (1706) was in this form. The last unmeasured preludes for harpsichord date from the 1720s.

The development of the prelude in 17th century Germany led to a sectional form similar to keyboard toccatas by Johann Jakob Froberger or Girolamo Frescobaldi. Preludes by northern German composers such as Dieterich Buxtehude (c.1637–1707) and Nikolaus Bruhns (c.1665–1697) combined sections of free improvised passages with parts in strict contrapuntal writing (usually brief fugues). Outside Germany, Abraham van den Kerckhoven (c.1618–c.1701), one of the most important Dutch composers of the period, used this model for some of his preludes. Southern and central German composers did not follow the sectional model and their preludes remained improvisational in character with little or no strict counterpoint.

During the second half of the 17th century, German composers started pairing preludes (or sometimes toccatas) with fugues in the same key; Johann Pachelbel (c.1653–1706) was one of the first to do so, although Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s (1685–1750) &quot;prelude and fugue&quot; pieces are much more numerous and well-known today. Bach&#x27;s organ preludes are quite diverse, drawing on both southern and northern German influences. Most of Bach&#x27;s preludes were written in the theme and variation form, using the same theme motif with imitation, inversion, modulation, or retrogression of the theme as well as other techniques involved in this baroque form.

Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer was one of the first German composers to bring the late 17th-century French style to German harpsichord music, replacing the standard French ouverture with an unmeasured prelude. Fischer&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne musica&quot; is a cycle of keyboard music which consists of pairs of preludes and fugues; the preludes are quite varied and do not conform to any particular model. &quot;Ariadne musica&quot; served as a precursor to Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, two books of 24 &quot;prelude and fugue&quot; pairs each. Bach&#x27;s preludes were also varied, some akin to Baroque dances, others being two- and three-part contrapuntal works not unlike his inventions and sinfonias. Bach also composed preludes to introduce each of his English Suites.

&quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; influenced many composers in the coming centuries, some of whom wrote preludes in sets of 12 or 24, sometimes with the intention of utilizing all 24 major and minor keys as Bach had done. Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849) wrote a set of 24 preludes, Op. 28, often composed in a simple ternary form, which liberated the prelude from its original introductory purpose and allowed it to serve as an independent concert piece. While other pianist-composers, including Muzio Clementi, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Ignaz Moscheles, had previously published collections of preludes for the benefit of pianists unskilled at improvisatory preluding, Chopin&#x27;s set renewed the genre.

Chopin&#x27;s set served as a model for other collections of 24 or 25 piano preludes in the major and minor keys, including those by Charles-Valentin Alkan (Op. 31 for piano or organ), Ferruccio Busoni (Op. 37, BV 181), César Cui (Op. 64), Stephen Heller (Op. 81), and Alexander Scriabin (Op. 11). Claude Debussy (1862–1918) wrote two books of impressionistic piano preludes which, unusually in this genre, carry descriptive titles. Chopin&#x27;s conception of the prelude as an unattached character piece expressing a mood rather than a specific musical programme extended into the 20th century with works by composers such as George Antheil, George Gershwin, Alberto Ginastera, Dmitry Kabalevsky, Bohuslav Martinů, Olivier Messiaen, Sergei Rachmaninoff (who also completed an entire set), Giacinto Scelsi and Karol Szymanowski.

Preludes were also incorporated by some 20th-century composers into Baroque-inspired suites: such &quot;attached&quot; preludes include Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot; (1914/17) and Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Suite for piano&quot;, Op. 25 (1921/23), both of which begin with an introductory prelude (Schoenberg&#x27;s choral introduction to the Genesis Suite is a rare case of an attached prelude written in the 20th century without any neo-baroque intent). As well as a series of unattached piano preludes (Op. 34), Dmitri Shostakovich composed a set of 24 Preludes and Fugues in the tradition of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, though arranged by key not chromatically, like Bach&#x27;s, but using the circle of fifths, as Chopin had done.

Some avant-garde composers have also produced unattached preludes. John Cage&#x27;s brief Prelude for Meditation is written for prepared piano, while François-Bernard Mâche&#x27;s &quot;Prélude&quot; (1959) and Branimir Sakač&#x27;s &quot;Aleatory Prelude&quot; (1961) call on electronic resources and aleatoric techniques.

==Notable collections of preludes==
* Charles-Valentin Alkan (1813–1888) wrote a set of 25 preludes, Op. 31, published in 1847. His key scheme differs from Chopin&#x27;s in that the major keys ascend chromatically and are followed by their respective minor subdominants, though Alkan also starts on C major. The last piece returns to C major, hence the additional prelude (a device Alkan repeated in the Esquisses, Op. 63, and that César Cui employed in his own 25 Preludes, Op. 64). As a further distinction between his and Chopin&#x27;s sets, Alkan provides programmatic titles for several of his preludes, including the most famous of the set, (&quot;The Song of the Madwoman by the Seashore&quot;).
* Lera Auerbach (born 1973) wrote three full sets of 24 preludes, which cycle through all of the major and minor keys, for piano solo, violin and piano, and cello and piano respectively (2003).
* Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) wrote the two volumes of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; (1722, 1744). Both volumes contain 24 preludes (and associated fugues) proceeding up the chromatic scale with alternating parallel major and minor keys (C major and C minor; C major and C minor; D major and D minor; etc.).
* Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) wrote two preludes, Op. 39, as a teenager; each one cycles through all of the major keys of the piano.
* Felix Blumenfeld (1863–1931) composed a set of 24 preludes, Op. 17 in 1892, following Chopin&#x27;s key scheme, as well as a set of four, Op. 12.
* York Bowen (1884–1961) wrote a set of 24 preludes, his Op. 102, in 1938. It is in all major and minor keys and was published posthumously.
* Julian Cochran (born 1974) wrote three volumes of preludes, many with an impressionistic character, and increasing in complexity and length through each volume.
* Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849) wrote 24 Preludes, Op. 28, which cycle through all of the major and minor keys. The odd numbered preludes are in major keys, starting with C major, and each is followed by a prelude in the relative minor key. The paired preludes proceed through the circle of fifths (C major and A minor; G major and E minor; D major and B minor; etc.). Most can be played as stand-alone pieces.
* Claude Debussy (1862–1918) wrote two books of 12 Préludes, Book 1 (1910) and Book 2 (1913), for a total of 24 preludes. The title of the prelude is given at the end of the piece, while a Roman numeral serves as the heading.
* Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer (c. 1656 – 1746)&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne musica&quot; (1702), contained 20 preludes and fugues in 19 different keys.
* Alberto Ginastera (1916–1983) wrote a cycle of 12 American Preludes (; 1946).
* Paul Hindemith (1895–1963) wrote &quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot; (1940), a prelude, 11 interludes, and a postlude, all separated by 12 fugues.
* Dmitry Kabalevsky (1904–1987) wrote many preludes for piano, op. 1, op. 5, op. 20, op. 38, op. 61 (1943–1944).
* Nikolai Kapustin (1937–2020) wrote 24 Preludes in Jazz Style, Op. 53, and later a set of 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 82.
* Olivier Messiaen (1908–1992)&#x27;s set of eight piano preludes (1929) developed from the Impressionism of Debussy&#x27;s piano music.
* Casimir Ney (1801–1877) wrote a collection of 24 preludes in all major and minor keys for solo viola from 1849 to 1853.
* Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959) wrote 5 preludes for guitar (1940), which have become popular repertory pieces. A sixth prelude is lost.
* Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943) wrote a prelude, Op. 3, No. 2, in 1892 followed by 10 preludes, Op. 23 (1903) and 13 preludes, Op. 32 (1910) for a total of 24 preludes in all the major and minor keys; he also composed a prelude in D minor, without opus number, in 1917 (there is yet another among his early unpublished works).
* Florent Schmitt (1870–1958) wrote two books of preludes, book 1, 3 &quot;préludes&quot; op. 3 (1890 - 95), book 2,&quot;10 Préludes&quot; op. 5 (1896).
* Alexander Scriabin (1872–1915) wrote 24 Preludes, Op. 11 in 1896, and numerous shorter sets of preludes. He followed the same pattern as the Chopin preludes.
* Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) wrote a cycle of 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87 in 1951, as well as an earlier set of 24 Preludes, Op. 34 (1933), for piano.
* Matthias Vanden Gheyn (1721–1785) composed 11 preludes, possibly off-the-cuff, for performance on a carillon, a musical instrument of bells. They are festive pieces featuring virtuosic progressions and effects to a propulsive bass rhythm. They are additionally the earliest known compositions specifically for the instrument. Citing his preludes, carillonneurs refer to Vanden Gheyn as &quot;the Bach of the carillon&quot;.

<text>CNBC is an American business news channel owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal. The network broadcasts business news and analysis programming during the morning, daytime trading day, and early-evening hours, while off-peak hours (such as weekday prime time and weekends) are filled by business-related documentaries and reality television programming, as well as occasional NBC Sports presentations. CNBC operates an accompanying financial news website, CNBC.com, which includes news articles, video and podcast content, as well as subscription-based services. CNBC&#x27;s headquarters and main studios are located in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, while it also maintains a studio at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square, New York City.

CNBC was originally founded in April 1989 as the Consumer News and Business Channel, a joint venture between NBC and Cablevision. Following its 1991 bankruptcy, NBC acquired the competing Financial News Network (FNN) and merged it into CNBC, and acquired Cablevision&#x27;s stake in CNBC to give it full ownership. In addition to its U.S. operations, CNBC operates the international branches CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia, and is involved in other international affiliates via joint ventures and franchise arrangements. In 2023, CNBC had higher total day and primetime viewership than its chief rival, Fox Business, but finished behind Fox in trading day viewership. CNBC launched an over-the-top media service known as CNBC+ in 2025, which starts at $14.99 a month and $99.99 a year.

==History==
CNBC&#x27;s roots date back to the founding in 1979 of the Satellite Program Network (SPN), which showed a low-budget mix of old movies and instructional and entertainment programs. The channel later changed its name to Tempo Television. After initially signing a letter of intent to acquire Tempo, NBC opted for a deal to lease the channel&#x27;s transponder in June 1988. On this platform, and under the guidance of Tom Rogers, the channel was relaunched on April 17, 1989, as the Consumer News and Business Channel with Neil Cavuto anchoring this first broadcast. NBC and Cablevision initially operated CNBC as a 50–50 joint venture, and it was headquartered in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Sue Herera and Scott Cohn joined CNBC at its inception.

CNBC had considerable difficulty getting cable carriage at first, as many providers were skeptical of placing it alongside the longer-established Financial News Network. By the winter of 1990, CNBC was in only 17 million homes – less than half of FNN&#x27;s potential reach – despite the size of NBC, its parent.

After an accounting scandal, FNN filed for bankruptcy protection on March 2, 1991, and put itself up for sale. After a bidding war with a Dow Jones &amp; Company–Westinghouse Broadcasting consortium, CNBC was awarded FNN by a bankruptcy judge for $154.3 million on May 21, 1991, and merged the two operations. CNBC hired around 60 of FNN&#x27;s 300-person workforce, including Joe Kernen who is still with the channel, joined CNBC at that time. Other former FNN&#x27;s workforce were hired by Bloomberg Television. The deal increased the distribution of the network to over 40 million homes. Cablevision sold its 49.5% stake in CNBC to NBC upon completion of the deal.

Roger Ailes was hired as the president of CNBC in August 1993, tasked by NBC CEO Bob Wright with turning around the struggling network. Ailes resigned in January 1996 due to disagreements with management including the decision by NBC management to form a joint venture with Microsoft that included the rebrand of &quot;America&#x27;s Talking&quot; as MSNBC. Under the leadership of Ailes, annual revenue at CNBC rose from $43 million to $110 million.

In June 1995, CNBC launched the Hong Kong-based CNBC Asia, and CNBC Europe, headquartered in London, in March 1996.

In December 1997, CNBC formed a strategic alliance with Dow Jones, including content sharing with Dow Jones Newswires, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, MarketWatch, and &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; and the rebranding of the channel as &quot;a service of NBC and Dow Jones&quot;. As part of the agreement, Dow Jones merged their competing business news channels—London-based European Business News and Singapore-based Asia Business News—into CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia respectively, with CNBC shutting down its Hong Kong–based operation and relocating the new CNBC Asia to ABN&#x27;s Singapore studios.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, CNBC&#x27;s ratings increased sharply along with the stock market, often beating those of CNN during market hours. The highest daytime viewership of the network in 2000 was 343,000.

However, after the burst of the dot-com bubble, CNBC&#x27;s viewing figures declined in tandem. In 2002, CNBC&#x27;s ratings fell 44% and were down another 5% in 2003. The network&#x27;s ratings steadily fell until bottoming in Q1 2005, with an average viewership of 134,000 during the day.

From 2001 to 2006, the CNBC website was operated by MSN.

In August 2003, CNBC signed a deal to provide weather content from AccuWeather.

In October 2003, CNBC moved its world headquarters from Fort Lee (which became the new home of Telemundo flagship station WNJU) to a new digital video production studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

NBC Universal reacquired full control of loss-making CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia from Dow Jones at the end of 2005. The licensing agreement between Dow and CNBC U.S. remained intact, until it expired in 2012.

CNBC reported annual revenues of $510 million in 2006. In September 2006, CNBC launched the FTSE CNBC Global 300 stock market index in conjunction with FTSE Group. The index includes the fifteen largest companies from each of the sectors of the Industry Classification Benchmark as well as the thirty largest companies from emerging markets. Profits at CNBC exceeded $333 million in 2007, making CNBC the second most profitable of NBC Universal&#x27;s thirteen cable channels in the United States, behind only the USA Network. Ratings hit an all-time high in 2007.

CNBC Africa was launched on June 1, 2007. On October 22, 2007, CNBC introduced the &quot;CNBC Investor Network&quot;, a network of webcams stationed in the operating departments of various independent financial institutions across the United States, allowing traders to be interviewed instantaneously as news breaks. In December 2007, CNBC formed a content partnership with Yahoo! Finance.

In January 2008, CNBC formed a content partnership with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which was seen as an attempt by both parties to take on increased competition from News Corporation. In May 2008, CNBC formed a content partnership with AOL.

Average daytime viewership (6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) reached a seven-year high of 310,000 viewers in the first quarter of 2008. Ratings plummeted in 2009 as the network aired bad economic news resulting from the Great Recession. In January 2010, the launch of the Korean language channel SBS-CNBC marked the fifteenth CNBC-branded channel worldwide. In July 2010, BT signed a five-year contract with CNBC Europe to distribute content from its London headquarters to sister sites in Europe and the US.

In 2011, CNBC won an award at the International Broadcasting Convention for its CNBC 4D: Interactive motion tracking that allows CNBC presenters to interact with 3D graphics, using technology from Unreel, Brainstorm, Motion Analysis. In June 2012, CNBC expanded its partnership with Yahoo! Finance in an effort to reach more online viewers. That month, CNBC.com had 6.5 million unique visitors in the United States while Yahoo! Finance had 37.5 million.

In 2013, host Maria Bartiromo left CNBC for Fox Business in part because Fox offered her $5–6 million per year compared to the $4 million per year that she made at CNBC. Also that year, CNBC took over production of the popular public television program &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; from NBR Worldwide, a subsidiary of Atalaya Global Management.

The company publishes annual lists, including the CNBC Disruptor 50 since 2013 and the CNBC25 since 2014.

On January 6, 2015, CNBC changed the way it calculates ratings, switching from Nielsen ratings to a system by Cogent Research to calculate the viewership of its business day programming by surveying financial advisers and investors, with the goal of providing a more accurate measurement of the network&#x27;s out-of-home viewership; Nielsen is still used to track the viewership of its entertainment programming.

In October 2015, a Republican Party candidates debate hosted by CNBC was seen by 14 million viewers—the highest viewership of a CNBC program to-date.

On January 10, 2016, CNBC announced a new partnership with Indonesian broadcaster Trans Media to form CNBC Indonesia.

By 2017, Fox Business had overtaken CNBC as the most watched daytime business news network.

CNBC&#x27;s online video operations generated an all-time high of 1.92 billion total digital video starts across platforms in 2020.

In 2020, CNBC hired former Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith to host a new evening newscast on the channel, &quot;The News with Shepard Smith&quot;, which premiered that September. It was positioned as an objective, &quot;fact-based&quot; national newscast.

In September 2021, CNBC signed a new multi-platform deal with Jim Cramer; in addition to his existing television roles, the agreement includes the co-development of live events and digital content through his company Cramer Media (replacing his previous arrangement with TheStreet, which Cramer had co-founded, and sold to The Arena Group in 2019), including a direct-to-consumer subscription service. In January 2022, the subscription service launched as the &quot;CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer&quot;, which includes commentaries, stock picks, and monthly online meetings. The service operates alongside another CNBC subscription service, &quot;CNBC Pro&quot;, which similarly provides exclusive content and over-the-top streaming of CNBC&#x27;s networks.

In August 2022, Mark Hoffman stepped down as president of CNBC after 17 years at the network, being succeeded by NBCUniversal president of global advertising and partnerships KC Sullivan. Under Sullivan, the network began to refocus its programming to broaden appeal to its core business audience, including a promise of more business-related documentaries in primetime, and cancelling the low-rated &quot;The News with Shepard Smith&quot; in November 2022 in favor of the new financial news program &quot;Last Call&quot; with Brian Sullivan, which premiered in January 2023, and ran until July 18, 2024.

On December 11, 2023, CNBC underwent a major rebranding, updating its logo for the first time since 1996 (adopting the updated NBC peacock and corporate typeface introduced a year prior), and revamping its on-air graphics with a simpler flat design. The two-tiered stock ticker CNBC had historically used was replaced with a single scroll, with major indices now displayed in a strip below the stock ticker.

In March 2024, CNBC announced plans to add its personal finance brand “Make It” to weekend programming. Make It offers personal finance tips, career guidance, and other forms of advice-based content to consumers. According to CNBC, Make It-branded content (which launched in 2016) forms CNBC.com’s largest vertical.

In April 2024, CNBC celebrated its 35th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange. 

In November 2024, a Brazilian affiliate known as Times Brasil launched as CNBC&#x27;s first local franchise in South America. It was founded by Douglas Tavolaro, who had originally founded CNN Brasil.

On November 20, 2024, NBCUniversal announced its intent to spin off most of its cable networks, including CNBC, as a new publicly-traded company controlled by Comcast shareholders. It is currently unclear how the spin-off will affect CNBC, including whether it will still be able to use NBC News resources or the NBC brand. CNBC had largely operated autonomously from NBC News until Cesar Conde became head of the NBCUniversal News Group in 2020, after which the network began to engage in some resource sharing with the division.

==Physical stores==

CNBC has a licensing partnership with Paradies Lagardère to operate retail locations in United States airports branded as CNBC News, CNBC Express, and CNBC SmartShop. The stores sell CNBC-branded merchandise as well as snacks and drinks.

The CNBC stores first launched in 2001, when the company announced plans to open as many as 100 airport shops in the United States. As of 2024, CNBC airport stores continue to expand, with a Pensacola International Airport location unveiled in Florida that November.

==Criticism==
CNBC has been criticized for allegedly amplifying bull and bear markets, particularly in the run-up to the dot-com bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis a decade later. In response to these criticisms, CNBC anchors have pointed to the size of the market and noted that influencing it is &quot;a little out of our reach&quot;.

Jon Stewart on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot; has been a vocal critic of CNBC and some of its personalities, beginning after comments were made by Rick Santelli. Despite the lack of direct comments by the network, several personalities have defended their predictions and comments.

CNBC was accused by the Obama administration of &quot;cable chatter&quot;—the excessive and sometimes brutal discussion on a particular topic, often one-sided.

===Performance of Jim Cramer&#x27;s stock picks===
Regarding CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Money&quot; host Jim Cramer, a 2007 article in &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; stated that &quot;his picks haven&#x27;t beaten the market. Over the past two years, viewers holding Cramer&#x27;s stocks would be up 12%, while the Dow rose 22% and the S&amp;P 500 16%.&quot;

== High definition ==

On October 10, 2007, CNBC HD, a 1080i high-definition television simulcast of CNBC, was launched, first on DirecTV.

On October 13, 2014, coincidentally the 11th anniversary of CNBC&#x27;s relocation to its current facilities in Englewood Cliffs, NJ, CNBC switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, in line with CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe.

CNBC occasionally serves as an outlet for NBC Sports programming, and essentially acts as an overflow feed when USA Network is broadcasting sports events.

Consistent programming includes the Premier League and the Olympics.

Generally, during weekdays CNBC airs coverage from 5-8PM ET, following business coverage. During weekends, CNBC carries much more extensive sports coverage.

<doc id="223449" wikidata="Q266302" url="?curid=223449" title="Cobitidae">
<text>Cobitidae, also known as the true loaches, is a family of Old World freshwater fish. They occur throughout Eurasia and in Morocco, and inhabit riverine ecosystems. Today, most &quot;loaches&quot; are placed in other families (see below). The family includes about 260 described species. New species are being described regularly.

==Description and ecology==
The body forms of the Cobitidae tend to be vermiform – worm-shaped, long and thin. Most true loaches do not have true scales, and like many other Cypriniformes or catfishes, they have barbels at their mouths (usually three to six pairs). Some other traits typically found in this family are a small bottom-facing mouth suited to their scavenging benthic lifestyle, an erectile spine below the eye, and a single row of pharyngeal (throat) teeth.

True loaches are mostly scavengers and are omnivorous, usually not very picky about their food. They may eat aquatic crustaceans, insects, and other small invertebrates, as well as scraps of organic detritus. Many live in eutrophic waters of generally poor quality and feed on tubifex worms and similar benthos associated with such habitat. Some of these loaches have adapted to low oxygen levels in warm, muddy rivers or dirty ponds by being able to gulp up atmospheric oxygen. Some species, particularly from the genera &quot;Cobitis&quot; and especially &quot;Misgurnus&quot;, are sensitive to changing air pressure. They change their behavior accordingly, and as these changes in activity are usually followed by a change in weather, they are commonly known as &quot;weather fishes&quot; or &quot;weather loaches&quot;.

Some Cobitidae have been introduced to foreign lands, where they may pose problems to local wildlife as invasive species. Other true loaches, many of them migratory fish, have been seriously affected by habitat destruction, chemical pollution, and damming, and are considered threatened species today. Some migratory species are popular aquarium fish and since they are very hard to raise in captivity, overfishing has seriously depleted once-common stocks in several cases.

==Systematics==
The other &quot;loaches&quot; used to be included in this family, but nowadays are recognized as well-distinct members of the order Cypriniformes. Together with the suckers (Catostomidae), the &quot;loaches&quot; made up the superfamily Cobitoidea. However, the sucking loaches (Gyrinocheilidae) were easily recognizable as relatives of the suckers.

Eventually, the hillstream loaches, though more similar to the true loaches than the other two presumed Cobitoidea, were recognized as distinct enough to be better regarded a family in their own right - Balitoridae. And as it seems the &quot;sucking Cobitoidea&quot; are quite distant indeed, perhaps even markedly closer to the Cyprinidae, thus the old superfamily Catostomoidea warrants revalidation. Finally, the puzzling mountain carps were most often considered the distinct family Psilorhynchidae in recent times. In a number of systematic schemes, though, they were placed in the Balitoridae (or Balitorinae, when these were included in the Cobitidae). In fact, they seem to be loach-like carps and belong in the Cyprinidae.

In 2012, Maurice Kottelat reviewed the loaches and elevated the former subfamily Botiinae to its own family, Botiidae, and established the family Serpenticobitidae for the genus &quot;Serpenticobitis&quot;.

==Genera==
Cobitidae has the following genera classified within it:
==Use by humans==
Some true loaches are popular as food fish in East Asian countries such as Japan. These are of importance in the fisheries or being raised in aquaculture. Small species may occasionally be caught for bait.

===As aquarium fish===

Many of the more brightly colored species are popular with freshwater aquarists, so are therefore of importance in the aquarium trade. Some Cobitidae often encountered in aquarium trade include:
* Dojo loach, &quot;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&quot;
* Horseface loach, &quot;Acantopsis choirorhynchus&quot;
* Kuhli loach, &quot;Pangio kuhlii&quot;

<doc id="223454" wikidata="Q782526" url="?curid=223454" title="Quadraphonic sound">
<text>Quadraphonic (or quadrophonic, also called quadrasonic or by the neologism quadio formed by analogy with &quot;stereo&quot;]) sound – equivalent to what is now called 4.0 surround sound – uses four audio channels in which speakers are positioned at the four corners of a listening space. The system allows for the reproduction of sound signals that are (wholly or in part) independent of one another.

Four channel quadraphonic surround sound can be used to recreate the highly realistic effect of a three-dimensional live concert hall experience in the home. It can also be used to enhance the listener experience beyond the directional limitations of ordinary two channel stereo sound. Quadraphonic audio was the earliest consumer product in surround sound. Since it was introduced to the public in the early 1970s many thousands of quadraphonic recordings have been made.

Quadraphonic sound was a commercial failure when first introduced due to a variety of technical issues and format incompatibilities. Four channel audio formats can be more expensive to produce than standard two-channel stereo. Playback requires additional speakers and amplifier channels. It may also require specially designed decoding equipment.

The introduction of home cinema products in the 1990s were first intended for movie sound, but also brought multi-channel music reproduction into popularity again. By this time new digitally based formats had been created. Many four channel recordings from the 1970s have been reissued in modern surround sound systems such as Super Audio CD, DTS, Dolby Digital, DVD-Audio and Blu-ray. Multichannel home audio reproduction has experienced a revival since 2000 and new four channel recordings have also been released to the public since this time.

A quadraphonic system will reproduce right front, right rear, left front, and left rear audio signals in four separate speakers. The reproduction capability of the rear speakers should be of the same quality or almost the same quality as the front speakers; ideally, a quadraphonic system uses four identical speakers.

== History ==
The first machines used for 4-channel sound recording were analog reel-to-reel tape recorders. These were developed for use by audio engineers in professional studios during the 1950s in Germany by Telefunken and also by Ampex in the United States. Such machines appeared in some European electronic-music studios by 1954.

Early attempts to reproduce four channel sound for home playback began with audio laboratory engineers in the late 1960s. Producer Thomas Mowrey, initially working at the Eastman School of Music, was one of the pioneers of classical quadraphonic recording. He later made quadraphonic productions for Deutsche Grammophon and other labels in the early 1970s, but many of these were released only as stereo recordings.

A small number of quadraphonic recordings were introduced to the American consumer market by Vanguard Records in June 1969 on reel-to-reel tape. The most popular medium used to market recordings to the public during the 1970s was the vinyl LP phonograph record. Quadraphonic recordings on 8-track tape were also popular in the 1970s, particularly among car audio enthusiasts.

In the 1970s specialized hardware systems were marketed by major electronic manufacturers to the public for decoding 4-channel recordings. These decoders were often sold as separate electronic components. Decoders were also available as built in features of some audio receivers or amplifiers sold during the 1970s.

Many quadraphonic recordings in the 1970s used &quot;matrix&quot; technologies to encode and decode four channels of audio information in a 2-channel medium, usually an LP. The poor decoding performance of early matrix formats was the main reason they disappeared once improved matrix systems arrived. The later matrix systems were based on work by Peter Scheiber. His basic formula used 90° phase-shift circuitry to enable enhanced 4–2–4 matrix systems to be developed, of which the two main leaders were Columbia&#x27;s SQ and Sansui&#x27;s QS systems.

The three most popular quadraphonic LP formats in the 1970s were SQ (Stereo Quadraphonic), QS (Regular Matrix) and CD-4 (Compatible Discrete 4) / Quadradisc.

The Japanese governing body and audio hardware manufacturers defined standards for quadraphonic sound. RM (&quot;Regular Matrix&quot;) was used a synonym for QS, QM (&quot;Quadraphonic Matrix&quot; was used for Stereo-4 and Dynaquad) and QX (&quot;QuadXtra&quot;, based on D.H. Cooper &quot;Dual-Triphonic&quot;) for UD4.

With Scheiber and Martin Willcocks, Jim Fosgate developed the Tate II 101 SQ decoder, which produced a very accurate sound field by using gain riding and the Haas effect to mask decoding artifacts. It used custom, hand-assembled and ‑calibrated circuitry with components sorted to 1%, for exact performance. Sansui&#x27;s QSD-series decoders and QRX-series receivers were very good, even synthesizing left-right stereo into a ⋂ horseshoe topology. However, all these came too late in the game and were too expensive or difficult to procure for public purchase, to rescue matrix quad from obscurity.

By the early 2000s more sophisticated &quot;discrete&quot; multichannel systems had mostly replaced matrix technologies, providing a higher level of performance and full channel independence. Today, software can be used to take the place of hardware decoding. Modern software algorithms are capable of more accurate decoding performance than the earlier hardware technologies.

All of the multichannel audio systems in common use today are digital systems. Digital multichannel audio has been available for the home since the introduction of surround sound movies in the 1990s using Dolby Digital and DTS. The most common digital media capable of reproducing surround sound music today are Super Audio CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, all of which are capable of playing high-resolution audio with multiple channels.

== Quadraphonic audio mixing ==
The audio mixing process for four channel sound is different than for stereo versions of the same recording. Most studio equipment is designed for stereo only, so specialized multichannel mixing consoles and playback systems must be available.

For classical music, producers have typically preferred an effect where the orchestra appears in stereo in only the front channels, and the natural reverberation or echo of the concert hall is in all the speakers. Some live concert recordings of popular music have also been mixed this way. Classical recordings rarely place primary or solo instruments in the rear channels, though it is done occasionally.

A few classical recordings have been made from a perspective in which the listener seems to be seated in the middle of the orchestra. One example is the 1973 Columbia Masterworks recording of Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;, conducted by Pierre Boulez. The original four channel recording was released on matrix LP and 8-track tape, and reissued on the Super Audio CD format by Dutton Vocalion in 2018. Notes supplied with the recording indicate the direction from which each group of instruments can be heard.

Pop, rock and jazz music producers have tended to employ a mixing style with a relatively high degree of musical separation between the four channels. This type of recording may place musical sounds in the rear channels that are of equal importance to the front channels. It can expand on the listener&#x27;s sense of direction and spaciousness in a way similar to what happened when recording engineers introduced stereo recording. In some four channel recordings sounds move in full rotation around the listener.

Mixing engineers can also aim for a hybrid effect between styles. While quadraphonic effects have sometimes been considered artificial, musical enjoyment can be dramatically enhanced by more fully involving the listener.

== Consumer quadraphonic audio formats ==

== LP phonograph records ==
Quadraphonic audio reproduction on vinyl phonograph records was problematic. As technologies advanced rapidly during the 1970s several different solutions were proposed to reproduce four channel sound from LPs. Some of these systems were much more successful than others. The simplest systems were &quot;derived&quot; (2–2–4) formats. These were soon followed by much more sophisticated &quot;matrix&quot; (4–2–4) formats, and finally, by the most advanced &quot;discrete&quot; (4–4–4) formats.

===Derived (2–2–4) formats===
Derived (2–2–4) formats are simple and inexpensive electronic solutions that add or extract rear &quot;ambience&quot; or &quot;reverberation&quot; sound channels from stereo records i.e., studio reverb, audience applause, etc. There is no precise placement of individual instruments in the rear channels.

*DY / Dynaquad (1969)
*Hafler circuit (1969)
*системы ABC (Quadra ABC – briefly used only in the Soviet Union) (1981)

===Matrix (4–2–4) formats===
With matrix formats four channels are converted (encoded) down to two channels. These are then passed through a two-channel transmission medium (usually an LP record) before being decoded to four channels and presented to four speakers. To transmit four individual audio signals in a stereo-compatible manner, there must be four simultaneous linear equations to reproduce the original four audio signals at the output.

These systems used matrix decoding technology to recover four channels from the two channels recorded on the record. Matrix systems can have a significant level of channel independence but not full channel separation.

*EV / Stereo-4 (1970)
*DY / Dynaquad (used as an encoding format on some records) (1971)
*SQ / Stereo Quadraphonic (1971)
*QS (Quadraphonic Sound)/ RM (Regular Matrix) (1971)

Matrix quadraphonic recordings can be played in two channels on conventional stereo record players. There are varying levels of stereo and mono compatibility in these systems. The term &quot;compatible&quot; indicates that:
# A single-channel (mono) system will reproduce all four audio signals in its one speaker.
# two-channel (stereo) system will reproduce the left front and left rear audio signals in the left speaker and the right front and right rear signals in the right speaker.

This 4:2:4 process could not be accomplished without some information loss. That is to say, the four channels produced at the final stage were not truly identical to those with which the process had begun. In order for the effect to work as intended a recording engineer needed to be specially trained for working in each of these formats. Special mixing rules for matrix recording minimize the technological limitations inherent in matrix formats and mask or eliminate undesired side effects.

==== EV-4/Stereo-4 and Dynaquad (DY) ====

The first of these were basic systems with relatively poor performance developed by Electro-Voice (&quot;EV-4/Stereo-4&quot;) and Dynaco (&quot;Dynaquad (DY)&quot;). A so-called &quot;matrix&quot; format, it utilized four sound channels which were encoded into two stereo album tracks. These were then decoded into the original four sound channels. But with poor decode performance, these systems failed to match the accuracy or channel independence of later matrix formats.

The original systems (DY and EV-4) suffered from low front left-right separation (around 12 dB) and a poor rear left-right separation of 2 dB. The decoders were designed more to give an effect rather than accurate decoding, which was mainly due to limitations in both systems. Since both systems were very closely related mathematically, users only needed one decoder of either system to playback albums of both systems.

The differences between the early and late matrix systems were so vast, it made decoding DY/EV-4 with either SQ or QS decoders with accuracy impossible; the results often being a &quot;smeared&quot; or poorly defined sound stage, which could be vastly different from what was intended by the producer or recording engineer.

==== QS Regular Matrix and SQ Quadraphonic ====
Improved systems based on Peter Scheiber&#x27;s work on utilizing 90-degree phase-shift circuitry came later, namely the &quot;QS&quot; and &quot;SQ&quot; systems.

The first of these, known as &quot;QS&quot;, was developed by Sansui Electric. A so-called matrix format, it utilized four sound channels, which were encoded into two stereo album tracks. These were then decoded into the original four sound channels. The QS system debuted in the United States in March 1971 and was improved by their &quot;Vario-Matrix&quot; system in 1973.

The second, &quot;SQ&quot;, was developed and marketed by Columbia Records and Sony and entered the US market in April 1971. The &quot;SQ&quot; format was also used by companies such as EMI in Great Britain, who pressed several &quot;SQ&quot; album releases. The sound separation of the &quot;SQ&quot; system was greatly improved by the introduction of &quot;SQ Full Logic&quot; decoding in 1975 using the Motorola chips MC1312, MC1314 &amp; MC1315.

Both SQ and QS had significant support from major record companies and hardware manufacturers during the 1970s. They also achieved notable sales and market penetration. Unfortunately, due to the similarities in name and technology these could easily be confused by the public.

===Discrete (4–4–4) formats===
Discrete reproduction describes a quadraphonic system in which all four channels are fully independent of each other. As its name suggests, with &quot;discrete&quot; formats the original four audio channels are passed through a four-channel transmission medium and presented to a four-channel reproduction system and fed to four speakers. This is defined as a 4–4–4 system.

*CD-4 (Compatible Discrete 4) / Quadradisc (1972)
*UD-4 / UMX / BMX (1974)

Discrete phonograph systems use a specialized demodulator to decode four fully independent sound channels. This allowed for full channel separation. Such systems could be prone to reduced record life. However, more durable vinyl formulations were quickly developed to work around this problem and nearly all discrete LPs use special vinyl. When discrete quadraphonic LPs are played on conventional stereo record players the entire music program can be heard in stereo.

==== CD-4 or Quadradisc ====

The third major format for four-channel vinyl LPs, known as &quot;CD-4&quot; or &quot;Quadradisc&quot;, was devised by the Japanese JVC Corporation along with its US counterpart RCA Records.

This quadraphonic format was first marketed in the United States in May 1972. A fully discrete system, it eschewed matrix technologies in favor of a method similar to the encoding of stereo FM broadcasts. With stereo records, the system uses 2 main left and right audio channels, and this is what allows CD-4 to maintain compatibility with conventional stereo playback. CD-4 also adds 2 additional &quot;difference&quot; audio channels to the main channels. The difference signals are encoded in ultrasonic carrier frequencies in the range of 30 kHz, which is above the audible range. CD-4 requires a specialized phono cartridge with a Shibata stylus to read these additional high frequencies. The combined signals are then sent to a special demodulator for four-channel decoding. The demodulator converts the ultrasonic signals back into the audible range and uses the difference channels to separate rear audio information from the main channels. Because the CD-4 system maintains four independent signals throughout the process it can accurately reconstruct the intended four-channel sound field.

==== UD-4 / UMX / BMX ====

&quot;UD-4/UMX&quot; was developed by Nippon/Columbia (Denon). This is a hybrid discrete/matrix system. Only 35 to 40 items are encoded in this format and it was marketed only in the UK, Europe, and Japan.

The short-lived system suffered from incompatibility with regular stereo playback due to phase differences between the left and right channels. UD-4 was less critical in its setup than CD-4 because the carriers did not have to handle frequencies as high as those found in the CD-4 system.

==Tape formats==

*Q4 / quadraphonic reel to reel (1969)
*Quad-8 (Q8) / quadraphonic 8-track (1970)

Quadraphonic systems based on tape were also introduced, based on new equipment capable of playing four discrete channels. These recordings are all discrete 4–4–4 recordings released in reel-to-reel and 8-track cartridge formats. Specially designed four channel machines were required to play these recordings. They are not compatible with stereo players.

=== Quadraphonic open reel tape (Q4) ===

In these systems all four available tracks were recorded on the tape running in the same direction. Pre-recorded four channel reel-to-reel tapes were recorded at 7 inches per second (IPS), which is the fastest speed used for consumer grade reel-to-reel machines. By comparison stereo pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes have 2 different programs with each running the opposite direction. Many stereo tapes were recorded at only 3 IPS, which is half of the full speed. The slower speed results in significantly poorer sound quality.

=== Quadraphonic 8-track tape (Quad-8 and Q8) ===

RCA Records followed, in April 1970, with its announcement of a four-channel version of the 8-track tape, named &quot;Quad-8&quot; or &quot;Quadraphonic 8-track tape&quot; (later shortened to just Q8). These eventually appeared in staggered releases (70 Tapes) split by October, November, and December 1970.

The format was almost identical in appearance to stereo 8-tracks, except for a small sensing notch in the upper left corner of the cartridge. This signaled a quadraphonic 8-track player to combine the odd tracks as audio channels for program 1, and the even tracks as channels for program 2. The format was not backward-compatible with stereo or mono players; although quadraphonic players would play stereo 8-tracks, playing quadraphonic tapes on stereo players resulted in hearing only one-half the channels at a time.

The last release in the quadraphonic 8-track format was in 1978, although most had stopped appearing by the end of 1976.

==Radio broadcast formats==

There were some experiments done with radio broadcasts (e.g., a Cliff Richard concert by the BBC, whose earliest quadraphonic broadcast was in July 1974), but they were short-lived.

One of the longest-lived radio broadcasts was WQSR-FM &quot;Quad 102½&quot; in Sarasota, Florida. Throughout most of the 1970s this station broadcast a signal which could be tuned as two separate stations with conventional stereo receivers.

San Francisco classical music station KKHI-FM broadcast the San Francisco Opera in &quot;compatible&quot; (that is, matrix-encoded) quadraphonic format during the 1970s, as did Chicago station WFMT&#x27;s live &quot;Chicago Lyric Opera&quot; broadcasts.

KRMH-FM (&quot;Good Karma Radio&quot;)(San Marcos/Austin, Texas) broadcast in &quot;Quad Stereo&quot; in the early 1970s from its studios and transmitter near Buda, Texas.

WWWW-FM (W4-QUAD 106.7) (Detroit) broadcast QS encoded quadraphonic sound in 1974.

KEXL-FM (&quot;KEXL 104.5&quot;) (San Antonio, Texas) broadcast in &quot;Quadraphonic&quot; in the early to mid 1970s from its studios in a high-rise office building off Main Plaza.

Seattle station KIRO-FM 100.7 later branded as KSEA 101 broadcast several hours daily between 1973 and early 1976 encoded SQ quadraphonic music. Sunday morning&#x27;s &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; from Salt Lake&#x27;s Mormon Tabernacle was in SQ quad.
&quot;Matrix H&quot; was developed by BBC engineers in 1977 to carry quadraphonic sound via FM radio in a way which would be most compatible with existing mono and stereo receivers.

Quadraphonic test programmes were made for BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4, including plays and The Proms.

The existing matrix formats were tested first. The &quot;H&quot; does not stand for a word; they called the first matrix they assessed Matrix A, and then worked through the alphabet. Matrix H emerged as the best solution for mono compatibility and radio transmission, but there was no specific commercially available decoder for it.

The BBC later cooperated with the developers of Ambisonics to produce &quot;BBC/NRDC System HJ&quot;. This was based on tolerance zones designed to include modified versions of both &quot;Matrix H&quot; and the prototype two-channel encoding of Ambisonics, known as &quot;System 45J&quot;. Subsequently, the Nippon-Columbia &quot;UMX&quot; matrix was brought into the standard, leading to the final &quot;UHJ&quot; name now associated with Ambisonics.

=== Universal SQ ===

In 1976, Ben Bauer integrated matrix and discrete systems into &quot;USQ&quot;, or &quot;Universal SQ&quot; (others had also done this with their quad systems).

It was a hierarchical 4–4–4 discrete matrix which used the SQ matrix as the baseband for discrete quadraphonic FM broadcasts using additional difference signals called &quot;T&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;.
For a USQ FM broadcast, the additional &quot;T&quot; modulation was placed at 38 kHz in quadrature to the standard stereo difference signal and the &quot;Q&quot; modulation was placed on a carrier at 76 kHz.

For standard two-channel SQ Matrix broadcasts, CBS recommended that an optional pilot-tone be placed at 19 kHz in quadrature to the regular pilot-tone to indicate SQ encoded signals and activate the listener&#x27;s logic decoder. CBS argued that the SQ system should be selected as the standard for quadraphonic FM because, in FCC listening tests of the various four-channel broadcast proposals, the 4:2:4 SQ system, decoded with a CBS Paramatrix decoder, outperformed 4:3:4 (without logic) as well as all other 4:2:4 (with logic) systems tested, approaching the performance of a discrete master tape within a very slight margin. At the same time, the SQ &quot;fold&quot; to stereo and mono was preferred to the stereo and mono &quot;fold&quot; of 4:4:4, 4:3:4 and all other 4:2:4 encoding systems.

==Live concerts==
In 1967 the group Pink Floyd debuted its custom-made quadraphonic speaker system and performed the first-ever surround-sound rock concert. This event was named &quot;Games for May&quot; and was held at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall. A control device they had made, the Azimuth Co-ordinator, used dual joysticks. It is now displayed at London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum, as part of their Theatre Collections gallery. The controller, which was usually operated by Richard Wright, allowed the musicians to place sounds in any speaker and move them around the listening area.

==Format comparisons==

In 1976, Mike Thorne created the vinyl album &quot;Quadrafile&quot;, with the same music recorded on all four of its sides, each side in a different quadraphonic format (QS, SQ, CD-4, and UD-4).

<text>General Anthony Clement &quot;Nuts&quot; McAuliffe (2 July 1898 – 10 August 1975) was a senior United States Army officer who earned fame as the acting commander of the 101st Airborne Division defending Bastogne, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. He is celebrated for his one-word reply to a German surrender ultimatum: &quot;Nuts!&quot;

After the battle, McAuliffe was promoted and given command of the 103rd Infantry Division, which he led from January 1945 to July 1945. In the post-war era, he was commander of United States Army Europe.

==Early life and military career==
McAuliffe was born in Washington, D.C., on 2 July 1898, to a family of Irish heritage. He attended West Virginia University from 1916 to 1917. He was a member of the West Virginia Beta chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity during his time at West Virginia University. He enrolled at West Point in 1917. McAuliffe was part of an accelerated program and graduated shortly after the end of World War I, in November 1918.

During this time, he visited Europe for a short time and toured several battlefields. Assigned to field artillery, he graduated from the Artillery School in 1920. For the next 16 years, McAuliffe carried out typical peacetime assignments. By 1935, he had been promoted to the rank of captain. Later, he was chosen to attend the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. In June 1940, McAuliffe graduated from the United States Army War College. Just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he was promoted again, temporarily becoming a lieutenant colonel with the Supply Division of the War Department General Staff. While in this position, McAuliffe supervised the development of such new technology as the bazooka and the jeep.

==World War II==

Brigadier General McAuliffe commanded the division artillery of the 101st Airborne Division when he parachuted into Normandy on D-Day. He also landed by glider in the Netherlands during Operation Market Garden.

In December 1944, the German army launched the surprise attack that became the Battle of the Bulge. Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, was attending a staff conference in the United States at the time. During Taylor&#x27;s absence, McAuliffe commanded the 101st and its attached troops. At Bastogne, the 101st was besieged by a far larger force of Germans under the command of General Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz.

===&quot;NUTS!&quot;===
On 22 December 1944, von Lüttwitz dispatched a party, consisting of a major, a lieutenant, and two enlisted men under a flag of truce to deliver an ultimatum. Entering the American lines southeast of Bastogne (occupied by Company F, 2nd Battalion, 327th Glider Infantry), the German party delivered the following to Gen. McAuliffe:

According to those present when McAuliffe received the German message, he read it, crumpled it into a ball, threw it in a wastepaper basket, and muttered, &quot;Aw, nuts&quot;. The officers in McAuliffe&#x27;s command post were trying to find suitable language for an official reply when Lieutenant Colonel Harry Kinnard suggested that McAuliffe&#x27;s first response summed up the situation well, and the others agreed. The official reply was typed and delivered by Colonel Joseph Harper, commanding the 327th Glider Infantry, to the German delegation. It was as follows:

The German major appeared confused and asked Harper what the message meant. Harper said, &quot;In plain English? Go to hell.&quot; The choice of &quot;!&quot; rather than something earthier was typical for McAuliffe. Captain Vincent Vicari, his personal aide at the time, recalled that &quot;General Mac was the only general I ever knew who did not use profane language. &#x27;Nuts&#x27; was part of his normal vocabulary.&quot;

The artillery fire did not materialize, although several infantry and tank assaults were directed at the positions of the 327th Glider Infantry. In addition, the German Luftwaffe attacked the town, bombing it nightly. The 101st held off the Germans until the 4th Armored Division arrived on 26 December to provide reinforcement.

===Post-Bastogne===
For his actions at Bastogne, McAuliffe was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, commanding the Third Army, on 30 December 1944 with official orders processed on 14 January 1945. He later received the Army Distinguished Service Medal twice, the Silver Star and the Legion of Merit.

Immediately after Bastogne, McAuliffe was promoted to major general and given command of the 103rd Infantry Division on 15 January 1945, his first divisional command assignment, which he retained until July 1945. Under McAuliffe, the 103rd reached the Rhine Valley, 23 March, and engaged in mopping up operations in the plain west of the Rhine River. In April 1945, the division was assigned to occupational duties until 20 April, when it resumed the offensive, pursuing a fleeing enemy through Stuttgart and taking Münsingen on 24 April. On 27 April, elements of the division entered Landsberg, where Kaufering concentration camp, a subcamp of Dachau, was liberated. The 103rd crossed the Danube River near Ulm on 26 April. On 3 May 1945, the 103rd captured Innsbruck, Austria, with little to no fighting. It then seized the Brenner Pass and met the 88th Infantry Division of the U.S. Fifth Army at Vipiteno, Italy, thereby joining the Italian and Western European fronts.

==Post-war==

Following the war, McAuliffe held many positions, including Chief Chemical Officer of the Army Chemical Corps, and G-1, Head of Army Personnel. He returned to Europe as commander of the Seventh Army in 1953, and Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army Europe in 1955. He was promoted to four-star general in 1955.

While still in the service, McAuliffe attended the premiere of &quot;Battleground&quot; in Washington D.C. on 9 November 1949. The film did not depict McAuliffe directly, but did show a scene of the Germans presenting their surrender demands and their confusion on receiving McAuliffe&#x27;s reply.

==Retirement==
In 1956, McAuliffe retired from the army. He worked for American Cyanamid Corporation from 1956 to 1963 as vice president for personnel. He began a program to teach employees to maintain contact with local politicians. The company subsequently required all branch managers to at least introduce themselves to local politicians. McAuliffe also served as chairman of the New York State Civil Defense Commission from 1960 to 1963.
After his retirement from American Cyanamid in 1963, McAuliffe resided in Chevy Chase, Maryland, until his death from leukemia on 10 August 1975, age 77. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Dates of rank==


==Awards and decorations==
McAuliffe&#x27;s decorations include the following:

===Badges===
===Decorations===
===Unit award===
===Service medals===
===Foreign awards===


==Memorials==

The central square of Bastogne, Belgium, is named Place Général McAuliffe. A Sherman tank, pierced by a German 88 mm shell, stands in one corner.

A southern extension of Route 33 in eastern Northampton County, Pennsylvania, completed in 2002, was named the Gen. Anthony Clement McAuliffe 101st Airborne Memorial Highway.

The new headquarters building for the 101st Airborne Division, which opened in 2009 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, is named McAuliffe Hall.

A room at the Thayer Hotel at West Point has been dedicated to General McAuliffe.

<text>FreeGEM released in 1999 is a windowing system based on Digital Research&#x27;s GEM which was first released in 1985. GEM stands for &quot;Graphics Environment Manager&quot;.

==Overview==
FreeGEM is the free software/open source version of GEM developed after Caldera Thin Clients released the GEM code under the terms of the GNU GPL-2.0-only free software license in April 1999. Caldera Thin Clients owned the source code to GEM through Caldera&#x27;s purchase of the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell on 23 July 1996, who had acquired Digital Research in June 1991.

FreeGEM code works on almost every version of DOS, and runs on almost every IBM compatible PC. One can download all the FreeGEM binaries and source code in one package through the OpenGEM SDK. The OpenGEM SDK also contains language bindings, documentation, and compilers. There are additional FreeGEM resources available through John C. Elliott&#x27;s GEM website.

OpenGEM is a popular FreeGEM distribution. Other distributions include Owen&#x27;s FreeGEM Distribution.

==OpenGEM==
OpenGEM is a non-multitasking 16-bit graphical user interface (GUI) for DOS. It is an extended distribution of FreeGEM that includes features of the original Digital Research GEM.

OpenGEM is intended to provide a simple to install and use GUI system and windowing framework for the FreeDOS operating system.

Caldera Thin Clients (later known as Lineo), who owned the source code to GEM through Caldera&#x27;s purchase of the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell on 23 July 1996, released the source to GEM under the terms of GPL-2.0-only in April 1999. OpenGEM was developed by Shane Martin Coughlan in collaboration with the FreeGEM Developer team, and is free software released under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only. OpenGEM versions 3 through 6 are hosted on SourceForge and on the FreeDOS website.

OpenGEM has not been actively developed since 2008 but is feature-complete as a basic GUI and includes a full SDK for future third-party development or extension.

=== Compatibility ===
OpenGEM works with FreeDOS Beta 9 and above, DR DOS 5.0 and above, MS-DOS 3.3 and above, PC DOS 3.3 and above, REAL/32, and DOSBox 0.65. OpenGEM will function on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, and Windows ME. It is not known to work with Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP or later.

<text>Udine ( ; ; ; ; ) is a city and (municipality) in northeastern Italy, in the middle of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, between the Adriatic Sea and the Carnic Alps. It is the capital of the Regional decentralization entity of Udine. Its population was 100,514 in 2012, 176,000 with the urban area.

==Names and etymology==

Udine was first attested in medieval Latin records as &quot;Udene&quot; in 983 and as &quot;Utinum&quot; around the year 1000. The origin of the name &quot;Udine&quot; is unclear. It has been tentatively suggested that the name may be of pre-Roman origin, connected with the Indo-European root *&quot;odh-&quot; &#x27;udder&#x27; used in a figurative sense to mean &#x27;hill&#x27;. The Slovene name &quot;Videm&quot; (with final -&quot;m&quot;) is a hypercorrection of the local Slovene name &quot;Vidan&quot; (with final -&quot;n&quot;), based on settlements named &quot;Videm&quot; in Slovenia. The Slovene linguist Pavle Merkù characterized the Slovene form &quot;Videm&quot; as an &quot;idiotic 19th-century hypercorrection.&quot;

== History ==
Udine is the historical capital of Friuli. The area has been inhabited since the Neolithic age.

Based on an old Hungarian legend, Attila (?–453), the leader of the Huns, built a hill there, when besieging Aquileia, because he needed a billet for his winter quarters: he instructed his soldiers to bring soil in their helmets and shields, because the landscape was too flat, without any hill. He established the town there, and built a square tower.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the area increased in importance after the decline of Aquileia, then further after the decline of Cividale. In AD 983 Udine was mentioned for the first time, with the donation of the &quot;Utinum&quot; castle by emperor Otto II to the Patriarchs of Aquileia, then the main feudal lords of the region. In 1223, with the foundation of the market, the city became finally the most important in the area for economy and trade, and also became the Patriarch&#x27;s seat.
In 1420, it was conquered by the Republic of Venice. In 1511, it was the seat of a short civil war, which was followed by an earthquake and a plague. Udine remained under Venetian control until 1797, being the second largest city in the state. After the short French domination which ensued, it was part of the Austrian Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, and was included in the newly formed Kingdom of Italy in 1866.

During World War I, from May 1915 to October 1917, Udine became the seat of the Italian High Command and was nicknamed &quot;Capitale della Guerra&quot; (&quot;War Capital&quot;). After the battle of Caporetto, it was occupied by the Germans in late 1917 and by the Austro-Hungarians in 1918 until after the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in 1918. After the war it was made capital of a short-lived province (&quot;Provincia del Friuli&quot;) which included the current provinces of Gorizia, Pordenone and Udine. After September 8, 1943, when Italy surrendered to the Allies in World War II, the city was under direct German administration, which ceased in April 1945.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Udine has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Precipitation is abundant all year round with spring and autumn being the wettest seasons. The highest temperature recorded was on July 21, 2006 while the lowest temperature recorded was on December 19, 2009.

== Demographics ==
In 2007, there were 97,880 people residing in Udine itself (whereas the greater area has a population double its size), located in the province of Udine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, of whom 46.9% were male and 53.1% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 14.36% of the population; in comparison, to pensioners accounted for 24.27%. This contrasts with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Udine residents is 47 compared to the Italian average of 42. Between 2002 and 2007, the population of Udine grew by 1.48%, whereas Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%. The current birth rate of Udine is 9.13 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

The nearby area close to the border has a Slovene population estimated at 2,000. A 1475 document mentions Slovene as the language of the &quot;lower class&quot; in the town, and the Udine Manuscript of 1458 contains Slovene vocabulary. Alasia da Sommaripa&#x27;s Italian–Slovenian dictionary was printed in Udine in 1607. However, the Slovenian minority is not officially recognized by the municipality, and Slovene is not taught in any city&#x27;s state educational institution, nor in neighboring municipalities. Udine, on the other hand, is one of the municipalities in Friuli where Friulian is taught.

, 85.30% of the population was of Italian descent. Of the four provincial capitals of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, as of 31 December 2022, Udine has the second highest percentage of foreign residents: 14,386 presences or 14.7% of the total population, higher than the regional average of 9.2%.

== Main sights ==

The old residence of the patriarchs of Aquileia, the &quot;palazzo Patriarcale&quot;, was erected by Giovanni Fontana in 1517 in place of the older one destroyed by an earthquake in 1511. Under the Austrians it was used as a prison. A recension of the Visigothic code of laws, called the Breviary of Alaric, was formerly preserved In the cathedral archives, in a manuscript known as the &quot;Codex Utinensis&quot;, which was printed before it was lost.

In the 1550s, Andrea Palladio erected some buildings in Udine. The &quot;Oratorio della Purità&quot; has 18th-century frescoes by Giambattista Tiepolo and his son Giandomenico.

The church dedicated to St. Mary of the Castle is probably the oldest in Udine, judging from extant fragments dating back to the Lombard era. It lost its parish status in 1263, when it was annexed to the larger parish of Saint&#x27;Odorico (now the cathedral). It has been renovated many times over the centuries: the façade, for example, was entirely rebuilt after the 1511 Idrija earthquake. Its three naves preserve the suggestive atmosphere of silence and contemplation, which is often found in old churches. The Venetian Governor, Tommaso Lippomano, commissioned the Venetian Gothic portico with steps and ramps leading down the hill in 1487.

In the principal square (Piazza della Libertà) stands the town hall (&quot;Loggia del Lionello&quot;) built in 1448–1457 in the Venetian-Gothic style opposite a clock tower (Torre dell&#x27;Orologio) resembling that of the Piazza San Marco at Venice. It was begun in 1448 on a project by Nicolò Lionello, a local goldsmith, and was rebuilt following a fire in 1876. The new design was projected by the architect Andrea Scala.

Opposite the Loggia del Lionello is the Loggia di San Giovanni, a Renaissance structure designed by Bernardino da Morcote. Other noteworthy monuments in the square are the Fountain by Giovanni Carrara, an architect from Bergamo (1542); the Columns bearing the Venetian Lion and the Statue of Justice (1614), the statues of Hercules and Cacus and the Statue of Peace (1819) which was donated to Udine by Emperor Francis I to commemorate the peace Treaty of Campoformido.

The Cathedral of Udine is an imposing edifice whose construction started in 1236, on a Latin cross-shaped plan with three naves and chapels along the sides. The church was consecrated in 1335 as &quot;Santa Maria Maggiore&quot;. At the beginning of the 18th century, a radical transformation project involving both the exterior and the interior was undertaken at the request and expense of the Manin family. The Baroque interior has monumental dimensions and contains many works of art by Tiepolo, Amalteo, and Ludovico Dorigny. On the ground floor of the bell tower (built from 1441 over the ancient baptistry) is a chapel which is completely adorned with frescoes by Vitale da Bologna (1349).

The centre of Udine is dominated by the castle, built by the Venetians from 1517 over a Lombard fortification ruined by an earthquake in 1511. The current Renaissance appearance dates from the intervention of Giovanni da Udine, who finished the works starting from 1547. The castle houses one of the most ancient Parliament Halls of Europe.

<text>Glengormley () is a townland (of 215 acres) and electoral ward in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Glengormley is within the urban area of Newtownabbey bordering Belfast, and is located in the Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council area. It is also situated in the civil parish of Carnmoney and the historic barony of Belfast Lower.

==Location==
The original settlement grew up in the mid-19th century, around a junction of the roads linking Belfast with Antrim and Ballyclare.

The wider suburban area of Glengormley borders North Belfast, Carnmoney and Mallusk. It is a popular residential area, include developments in 1995 - 2005 which have seen an expansion upwards from the village to the Hightown Road.

Glengormley is approximately six miles from Belfast; the sixth milestone from the city centre is located on the Ballyclare Road beside Glengormley High School.

==Geography==
As the lowest pass through the Belfast hills from the northern prospect, Glengormley is also traversed by major communication arteries including the Belfast to Derry railway line (served by Mossley West halt) and the M2 motorway.

As a main conduit for commuters, the townland experiences chronic congestion problems during peak times of the day, particularly on the A6 or Antrim Road. The M2 motorway runs close by and is accessible from the Sandyknowes Roundabout located at the end of the A6, with slip roads to the M2 northbound and southbound carriageways. The A8(M) motorway, which links Belfast with the port town of Larne and the main road into the Mallusk and Hydepark Industrial Estates as well as many other B roads are also accessible from Sandyknowes.

Despite being technically a glen (the area is in the valley between Cave Hill and Carnmoney Hill), Glengormley (Village) sits at 116m (380ft) above sea level with nearby Carnmoney Hill standing at 231m (757ft). Glengormley has a climate noticeably colder than the adjacent Lagan valley area. The cold and windy weather may be explained by the &#x27;tunnel&#x27; of natural features running from the Antrim coast to the edge of Glengormley on the Hightown Road. The &#x27;tunnel&#x27; can be seen from the Cavehill Country Park entrance at Hightown Road, looking north towards Slemish.

==History==

From Victorian times to the 1930s, Glengormley was often the final destination on the leisure trail for working-class Belfast citizens escaping the city grime. The three main stops on the trail were Belfast Castle, Belfast Zoo, and the dance hall in Glengormley, opposite the present day Glen Inn. The journey was made by tram or trolley bus or train. The Belfast Street Tramway Company replaced carts with horse-drawn trams and the Cavehill and Whitewell Tramway company ran a steam tramway from Glengormley into Belfast.

Sentry Hill was an early 19th-century farmhouse on the hill above Glengormley and Corr&#x27;s Corner in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim. It was the home of William Fee McKinney - a prosperous farmer and meticulous collector of farming, church and other records and artefacts. He was a member of the Linen Hall library and the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society. He was also the secretary of Carnmoney Presbyterian Church for 62 years.

==Leisure==
Glengormley is within walking distance of the Cavehill Country Park and Belfast Zoo. The expansive Valley Park provides a safe cycling route to the North Shore coastal cycle path and onwards to central Belfast.

At the southern end of Glengormley there is a 6 screen cinema, 10 pin bowling alleys, three snooker halls (two at the southern end and one at the northern end) and some commercial premises.

==Sports==
Glengormley also hosts a Gaelic Athletic Association club located on the hightown road, St Enda&#x27;s/ Naomh Éanna, Glengormley Amateur Boxing Club and a Mixed Martial Arts club.

==Commercial==
Glengormley hosts major commercial complexes in the Mallusk Enterprise Park, including Royal Mail, Henderson&#x27;s group, Diageo; (Baileys global supply) and Marks and Spencer distribution centre for Ireland. At peak times, Translink Metro and Ulsterbus buses to Belfast pass through Glengormley approximately every ten minutes, and take approximately twenty to thirty minutes to reach the city centre via the A6 Antrim Road, A2 Shore Road and the M2 motorway with Translink&#x27;s express service. Belfast is accessed by car via the Antrim Road or M2 motorway.

<text>A silver box is a modified DTMF keypad that adds four additional keys. This gives four columns of four keys each (16 total) instead of three columns (in the standard 12-pushbutton handset).

In the now-obsolete Autovon phone system these keys, used to set priority of a military call, were the red buttons in the photo on the right. Autovon included four precedence levels: Routine (no special tone), Priority (D), Immediate (C) and Flash (B) with Flash Override (A) as a capability. Each had the ability to interrupt lower-priority calls in progress if all trunks were busy. Each was activated using a button in an additional column of the keypad:
* A (697+1633 Hz): Flash Override (FO)
* B (770+1633 Hz): Flash (F)
* C (852+1633 Hz): Immediate (I)
* D (941+1633 Hz): Priority (P)

Autovon was replaced in the early 1990s by the Defense Switched Network; much of its infrastructure is now dismantled. Amateur radio equipment continues to be manufactured with 16-key DTMF keypads, keeping extra tones available for on-air use to control remote apparatus such as radio repeater stations. These tone pairs (labelled A, B, C, D) are rarely used.

Conversion of twelve-button keypads was usually accomplished with the addition of a toggle switch and a crystal that switched one column of a standard phone keypad into the &quot;fourth column&quot; used to generate 1633 Hz as the higher of the two tones output on a keypress.

Modern phones with an integrated circuit based DTMF generator can frequently be modified by simply soldering a wire from the 1633 Hz leg to a switch that toggles between that leg and the 1477 Hz leg for the rightmost column of keys.

<text>Malappuram (), is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala, with a coastline of . The most populous district of Kerala, Malappuram is home to around 13% of the total population of the state. The district was formed on 16 June 1969, spanning an area of about . It is the third-largest district of Kerala by area. It is bounded by Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea on either side. The district is divided into seven Taluks: Eranad, Kondotty, Nilambur, Perinthalmanna, Ponnani, Tirur, and Tirurangadi.

Malayalam is the most spoken language. The district has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Malappuram was the first e-literate as well as the first cyber literate district of India. The district has four major rivers, namely Bharathappuzha, Chaliyar, Kadalundippuzha, and Tirur Puzha, out of which the first three are also among the five longest rivers in Kerala.

Malappuram metropolitan area is the fourth largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi, Calicut, and Thrissur urban areas and the 25th largest in India with a total population of 1.7 million. 44.2% of the district&#x27;s population reside in the urban areas according to the 2011 census of India. Being home to 4 universities in the state, including the University of Calicut, Malappuram is a hub of higher education in Kerala. The district comprises 2 revenue divisions, 7 taluks, 12 municipalities, 15 blocks, 94 Grama Panchayats, and 16 Kerala Legislative Assembly constituencies in it.

During British Raj, Malappuram became the headquarters of European and British troops and later of the Malabar Special Police (M.S.P), formerly known as Malappuram Special Force formed in 1885, which is also the oldest armed police battalion in the state. The oldest Teak plantation in the world at Conolly&#x27;s plot is situated at Chaliyar valley in Nilambur. The oldest Railway line in the state was laid from Tirur to Chaliyam in 1861, passing through Tanur, Parappanangadi, and Vallikkunnu. The second railway line in the state was also laid in the same year from Tirur to Kuttippuram via Tirunavaya. The Nilambur–Shoranur line, also laid in the colonial era, is one among the shortest and picturesque Short Gauge Railway Lines in India.

== Etymology ==
The term, &quot;Malappuram&quot;, which means &quot;over the hill&quot; in Malayalam, derives from geography of Malappuram, the administrative headquarters of the district. The midland area of district is characterised by several undulating hills such as Arimbra hills, Amminikkadan hills, Oorakam Hill, Cheriyam hills, Pandalur hills, and Chekkunnu hills, all of which lie away from the Western Ghats. However, the coconut-fringed sandy coastal plain is an exception for the general hilly nature.

==History==



The remains of pre-historic symbols including Dolmens, Menhirs, and Rock-cut caves have found from various parts of district. Rock-cut caves have found from Puliyakkode, Thrikkulam, Oorakam, Melmuri, Ponmala, Vallikunnu, and Vengara. The ancient maritime port of Tyndis, which was then a centre of trade with Ancient Rome, is roughly identified with Ponnani, Tanur, and Kadalundi-Vallikkunnu-Chaliyam-Beypore region. Tyndis was a major center of trade, next only to Muziris, between the Cheras and the Roman Empire. Pliny the Elder (1st century CE) states that the port of &quot;Tyndis&quot; was located at the northwestern border of &quot;Keprobotos&quot; (Chera dynasty). The region, which lies north of the port at &quot;Tyndis&quot;, was ruled by the kingdom of Ezhimala during Sangam period. According to the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, a region known as &quot;Limyrike&quot; began at &quot;Naura&quot; and &quot;Tyndis&quot;. However the Ptolemy mentions only &quot;Tyndis&quot; as the &quot;Limyrike&quot;&#x27;s starting point. The region probably ended at Kanyakumari; it thus roughly corresponds to the present-day Malabar Coast. The value of Rome&#x27;s annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces. Pliny the Elder mentioned that &quot;Limyrike&quot; was prone by pirates. The Cosmas Indicopleustes mentioned that the &quot;Limyrike&quot; was a source of peppers. The river Bharathappuzha (River Ponnani) had importance since Sangam period (1st–4th century CE), due to the presence of Palakkad Gap which connected the Malabar coast with Coromandel coast through inland. 

The Kurumathur inscription found near Areekode dates back to 871 CE. Three inscriptions written in Old Malayalam those date back to 932 CE, those were found from Triprangode (near Tirunavaya), Kottakkal, and Chaliyar, mention the name of Goda Ravi of Chera dynasty. The Triprangode inscription states about the agreement of Thavanur. Several inscriptions written in Old Malayalam those date back to the 10th century CE, have found from Sukapuram near Edappal, which was one of the 64 old Nambudiri villages of Kerala. 
Descriptions about the rulers of Eranad and Valluvanad regions can be seen in the Jewish copper plates of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (around 1000 CE) and Viraraghava copper plates of Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (around 1225 CE). The Zamorin of Calicut originally belonged to Nediyiruppu at Kondotty in Eranad before he shifted his seat to the neighbouring Kozhikode. Eranad was ruled by a Samanthan Nair clan known as Eradis, similar to the Vellodis of neighbouring Valluvanad and Nedungadis of Nedunganad. The rulers of Eranad were known by the title &quot;Eralppad&quot;/&quot;Eradi&quot;. It was the ruler of Eranad (&quot;Eradi&quot; of Nediyiruppu) who established the kingdom of Calicut and developed Kozhikode as a major port city in the Malabar Coast. Just after that, the rulers of Parappanad (Parappanangadi) and the Vettathunadu (Tanur) became vassals of Zamorin. The Parappanad royal family is a cousin dynasty of Travancore royal family. Besides, a larger portion of Valluvanad Kovilakams (Nilambur, Manjeri, Malappuram, Kottakkal, and Ponnani) also became vassals of the Zamorin. 

The original headquarters of the &quot;Perumbadappu Swaroopam&quot;, who later became the Kingdom of Cochin, was at Chithrakoodam in Vanneri, Perumpadappu, which is located 10 km south to Puthuponnani, in Ponnani taluk. When Perumpadappu came under the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut, the rulers of Perumpadappu fled to Kodungallur, and later they moved to Kochi, where they established the Kingdom of Cochin. By 1250–1300 CE, almost whole of the district came under the rule of Zamorin.

The Mamankam festival, which had a special political importance in the medieval Kerala, was held at Tirunavaya, which lies on the northern bank of the river Bharathappuzha, in the district. The rivalry that existed between the Nambudiris in the Nambudiri villages of Panniyoor and Chowwara (Sukapuram) was also of great political importance in medieval Kerala. Panniyoor is situated opposite to Kuttippuram town while Sukapuram lies in Edappal. The Zamorins found themselves intervened in the so-called &quot;Koormatsaram&quot; between Nambudiris of Panniyurkur and Chovvarakur. In the most recent event, the Thirumanasseri Nambudiri had assaulted and burned the nearby rival village. The rulers of Valluvanadu and Perumpadappu came to help the Chovvaram and raided Panniyur simultaneously. Thirumanasseri Nadu was overran by its neighbours on south and east. The Thirumanasseri Nambudiri appealed to the Zamorin for help, and promised to cede the port of Ponnani, where the river Bharathappuzha merges with Arabian Sea, to Zamorin as the price for his protection. Thirumanassery Nambudiri, the Koya of Kozhikode, and ruler of Vettathunadu supported the Zamorin. Zamorin, looking for such an opportunity, gladly accepted the offer. In his military campaigns into Valluvanadu, the Zamorin received unambiguous assistance from the Muslim Middle Eastern sailors of Beypore, Chaliyam, Tanur, and Kodungallur, and the Koya of Kozhikode. As a reward by the Zamorin, the port at Ponnani became an important trade and cultural centre of middle eastern sailors. It seems that the Muslim judge of Kozhikode offered all help in &quot;money and material&quot; to the Samoothiri to strike at Tirunavaya. The Zamorin continued his conquest to Valluvanadu and conquered the regions of Kottakkal, Malappuram, Manjeri, and Nilambur. It was thus that Perumpadappu and a larger portion of Valluvanad came under the rule of Zamorin. Thus Zamorin became the &quot;Raksha Purusha&quot; of Mamankam, and the ruler of Tirunavaya, neighbouring Triprangode, and Ponnani.

Under the Zamorin, the regions included in the district emerged as major centres of foreign maritime trade in medieval Kerala. The Zamorin earned a greater part of his revenue by taxing the spice trade through his ports. Major ports in the kingdom of Zamorin included Parappanangadi, Tanur, and Ponnani. Parappanangadi (&quot;Barburankad&quot;), Tirurangadi (&quot;Tiruwarankad&quot;), Tanur, and Ponnani (&quot;Funan&quot;) were also important among the trade settlements under the rule of the Zamorin, according to the 16th-century historical work &quot;Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen&quot;. &quot;Thrikkavil Kovilakam&quot; in Ponnani served as a second home for Zamorin. Ponnani acted as the naval headquarters of his kingdom. Malappuram was the headquarters of &quot;Para Nambi&quot;, who was a local chieftain of the Zamorin. Other &quot;Kovilakams&quot; of Zamorin included the &quot;Kizhakke Kovilakam&quot; at Kottakkal, &quot;Manjeri Kovilakam&quot; at Manjeri, and &quot;Nilambur Kovilakam&quot; at Nilambur. &quot;Parappanad Kovilakam&quot; at Parappanangadi and &quot;Tanur Kovilakam&quot; at Tanur were vassal royal houses of the Zamorin. However the &quot;Mankada Kovilakam&quot; at Mankada near Angadipuram was the seat of ruling family of the &quot;Valluvanad Rajas&quot;. &quot;Azhvanchery Mana&quot;, which was the headquarters of Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, who was the supreme head of the Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala, is located at Athavanad near Kuttippuram, in Tirur Taluk. &quot;Azhvanchery Thamprakkal&quot; and the lord of Kalpakanchery in Kingdom of Tanur were usually present at the &quot;Ariyittu Vazhcha&quot; (Coronation) of a new Zamorin. The Arabs had the monopoly of trade in the early Middle Ages. The original headquarters of the &quot;Palakkad Raja&quot;s were also at Athavanad.

The squadron of Vasco da Gama left Portugal in 1497, rounded the Cape and continued along the coast of East Africa, where a local pilot was brought on board who guided them across the Indian Ocean, reaching Calicut in May 1498. At the time of the arrival of Vasco da Gama and his Portuguese fleet at Calicut, the Zamorin of Calicut was residing at Ponnani. The Zamorin had provided the Portuguese all facilities for trade. However, the Portuguese provocations on the Arab properties led to a conflict between the Zamorin and the Portuguese. Furthermore, Ponnani, which was the second headquarters of the Zamorin, was an important target of the Portuguese. The ruler of the Kingdom of Tanur, who was a vassal to the Zamorin of Calicut, sided with the Portuguese, against his overlord at Kozhikode. As a result, the Kingdom of Tanur (&quot;Vettathunadu&quot;) became one of the earliest Portuguese Colonies in India. The ruler of Tanur also sided with Cochin. Many of the members of the royal family of Cochin in 16th and 17th centuries were selected from Vettom. However, the Tanur forces under the king fought for the Zamorin of Calicut in the Battle of Cochin (1504). However, the allegiance of the Mappila merchants in Tanur region still stayed under the Zamorin of Calicut. Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, who is considered as the father of modern Malayalam literature, was born at Tirur (&quot;Vettathunadu&quot;) during Portuguese period. The medieval Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics that flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries, was also primarily based in &quot;Vettathunadu&quot; (Tirur region).

In 1507, the Portuguese Viceroy Francisco de Almeida raided Ponnani and started building a fortress there in 1585. The district witnessed several battles between Kozhikode naval chiefs, known as the Kunhali Marakkars, and the Portuguese for the monopoly in spice trade. The Kunjali Marakkars are credited with organizing the first naval defense of the Indian coast. Tanur town was one of the earliest Portuguese colonies in the Indian subcontinent. The towns of Ponnani and Parappanangadi were burnt by the Portuguese in the years 1525 and 1573–74 respectively. Some of the kings of Kingdom of Cochin in the 16th century CE, when Cochin became a major power on the Malabar coast, were usually selected from the royal family of Kingdom of Tanur. Portuguese were expelled from Kingdom of Tanur with the Battle at Chaliyam fort of 1571. Chaliyam was the northern border of Vettathunadu. During that battle, the Zamorin received unambiguous assistance from the Mappilas of Ponnani, Tanur, and Parappanangadi.
The &quot;Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen&quot; written by Zainuddin Makhdoom II (born around 1532) in Ponnani during 16th-century CE is the first-ever known book fully based on the history of Kerala, written by a Keralite. It is written in Arabic and contains pieces of information about the resistance put up by the navy of Kunjali Marakkar alongside the Zamorin of Calicut from 1498 to 1583 against Portuguese attempts to colonize Malabar coast. It was first printed and published in Lisbon. A copy of this edition has been preserved in the library of Al-Azhar University, Cairo. In 1532 with the help of the ruler of Tanur, a chapel was built at Chaliyam, together with a house for the commander, barracks for the soldiers, and store-houses for trade. Diego de Pereira, who had negotiated the treaty with the Zamorin, was left in command of this new fortress, with a garrison of 250 men; and Manuel de Sousa had orders to secure its safety by sea, with a squadron of twenty-two vessels. The Zamorin soon repented of having allowed this fort to be built in his dominions, and used ineffectual endeavours to induce the ruler of Parappanangadi, Caramanlii (King of Beypore?) (Some records say that the ruler of Tanur was also with them ) to break with the Portuguese, even going to war against them. In 1571, the Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at Chaliyam Fort. The continuous wars led by the Portuguese on one side and the Zamorin who had the support of the Arab merchants, and the local Nair and Mappila forces on the other side, ultimately led to the decline of Arab monopoly of foreign trade in the coastal towns. Unmindful of Portuguese opposition, the Zamorin entered into a treaty with the Dutch East India Company on 11 November 1604. This was followed by another treaty in 1608, which confirmed the earlier treaty and the Dutch assured assistance to Zamorin in expelling the Portuguese. The rise of the Dutch monopoly caused the Portuguese dominance also to decline. The cultural renaissance followed by the unrest of the 16th century produced the poets such as Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan and Poonthanam Nambudiri, who were instrumental in the development of Malayalam literature into the current form, and Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, who was also a member of the medieval Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.

By the middle of the 17th century, the Dutch had monopoly of foreign trade in the ports of Kerala, except for small English factories at Ponnani and Kozhikode. Though the arrival of William Keeling in 1650 was a beginning for the monopoly of the British East India Company in the region, they weren&#x27;t able to establish supremacy until 1792. During the 18th century, the &quot;de facto&quot; Mysore kingdom rulers Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan unified all smaller feudal states in the Northern Kerala and they were made part of the Kingdom of Mysore. For a short span of time in 1766, Manjeri was the headquarters of Sultan Hyder Ali. When the &quot;Samutiri Kovilakam&quot; at Calicut was besieged by the Mysore Sultan Haidar &#x27;Ali (18th century AD), the Zamorin sent his family members to &quot;Thrikkavil Kovilakam&quot; at Ponnani. The Battle of Tirurangadi was a series of engagements that took place between the British army and Tipu Sultan between 7 and 12 December 1790 at Tirurangadi, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. In 1792, Tipu Sultan was defeated by English East India Company through Third Anglo-Mysore War, and the Treaty of Seringapatam was agreed. As per this treaty, most of the Malabar Region, including the present-day Malappuram district, was integrated into the English East India Company. The Koyi Thampurans of Travancore belongs to Parappanad Royal Family. It was from this family that the consorts of the Rani&#x27;s Travancore family were usually selected. The oldest teak plantation of the world at Conolly&#x27;s plot is just from Nilambur town. It was named in memory of Henry Valentine Conolly, the then district collector of Malabar. The first railway line in the state started its function from Tirur to Chaliyam on 12 March 1861, with the oldest railway station at Tirur.

The district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. It is estimated that there were about 830 riots, large and small, during this period. During 1841–1921 there were more than 86 revolts against the British officials alone. The district was included in the subdistricts of Eranad, Valluvanad, and Ponnani in South Malabar during the British rule. The Malabar Special Police was headquartered at Malappuram. MSP is also the oldest armed police battalion in the state. The British had established Haig Barracks on the top of Malappuram city, at the bank of the Kadalundi River, to station their forces. 

The Malabar district political conference of Indian National Congress held at Manjeri on 28 April 1920 strengthened Indian independence movement and national movement in British Malabar. That conference declared that the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms were not able to satisfy the needs of British India. It also argued for land reform to seek solutions for the problems caused by the tenancy that existed in Malabar. However, the decision widened the drift between extremists and moderates within the Congress. The conference resulted in the dissatisfaction of landlords with the Indian National Congress. It caused the leadership of the Malabar district Congress Committee to come under the control of the extremists who stood for labourers and the middle class.
Malabar Rebellion was the last and important among the revolts. The Battle of Pookkottur adorns an important role in the rebellion. After the army, police, and British authorities fled, declaration of independence took place over 200 villages in Eranad, Valluvanad, Ponnani, and Kozhikode taluks by 28 August 1921. However less than six months after the declaration of autonomy, the East India Company reclaimed the territory and annexed it to the British Raj. The Wagon tragedy took place following the Malabar rebellion, where 64 prisoners died on 20 November 1921.

The erstwhile Madras presidency became Madras State following the independence of India in 1947. Malappuram revenue division was one of the five revenue divisions in the erstwhile Malabar District with the jurisdiction of Eranad (Manjeri) and Valluvanad (Perinthalmanna) Taluks. The other four revenue divisions in the Malabar district were Thalassery, Kozhikode, Palakkad, and Fort Cochin. On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was formed on linguistic basis. The district of Malappuram was formed with four subdistricts (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks, and 95 Gram panchayats at the time. Later, Tirur Taluk was bifurcated to form Tirurangadi Taluk, and Eranad Taluk was trifurcated to form two more Taluks namely Nilambur and Kondotty. The University of Calicut, which is also the second-oldest existing university in Kerala, and the Calicut International Airport, which is also the second-oldest existing airport in the state, started functioning at Tenhipalam and Karipur, in the years 1968 and 1988, respectively. In the 1970s, the oil reserves in the Persian Gulf countries were opened to commercial extraction and thousands of unskilled workers migrated to the gulf. They sent money home, supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century, the region attained First World health standards and near-universal literacy.

==Geography==
Bounded by Kozhikode district to the northwest, Wayanad district to the northeast, Nilgiri hills to the east, Palakkad district to the southeast, Thrissur district to the southwest, and Arabian Sea to the west, Malappuram has a total geographical area of 3,554 km2, which ranks third in the state in terms of area. The district possesses 9.15% of the total area of the state. The district is located at 75°E – 77°E longitude and 10°N – 12°N latitude on the geographical map. Similar to other parts of Kerala, Malappuram also has a coastal area (lowland) bounded by Arabian Sea on the west, a midland at the centre, and a hilly area (highland), bounded by Western Ghats on the east. Unlike other districts of Kerala, hilly areas are widely seen in the midland area too. The 2,554 m high Mukurthi peak, which is situated in the border of Nilambur Taluk and Ooty Taluk, and is also the fifth-highest peak in South India as well as the third-highest in Kerala after Anamudi (2,696 m) and Meesapulimala (2,651 m), is the highest point of elevation in Malappuram district. It is also the highest peak in Kerala outside the Idukki district. The 2,383 high Anginda peak, which is located closer to Malappuram-Palakkad-Nilgiris district border is the second-highest peak. Vavul Mala, a 2,339 m high peak situated on the trijunction of Nilambur Taluk of Malappuram, Wayanad, and Thamarassery Taluk of Kozhikode districts, is the third-highest point of elevation in the district.

===Border Taluks===
Malappuram district shares its border with the following 12 Taluks of 5 districts.
* Wayanad district: Vythiri Taluk.
* Kozhikode district: Kozhikode and Thamarassery Taluks.
* Nilgiris district: Pandalur, Gudalur, Ooty, and Kundah Taluks.
* Palakkad district: Pattambi, Ottapalam, and Mannarkkad Taluks.
* Thrissur district: Chavakkad and Kunnamkulam Taluks.

=== Topography ===
On the basis of topography, geology, soils, climate, and natural vegetation, the district is divided into 5 sub-micro regions:
* Malappuram coast
* Malappuram undulating plain
* Chaliyar river basin
* Nilambur forested hills
* Perinthalmanna undulating uplands.

The Malappuram coast lies all along the coastal tract of Malappuram from Vallikkunnu at the north to Perumpadappu at the south. It makes its boundaries with the Kozhikode coast to the north, Malappuram undulating plain to the east, the Thrissur coast to the south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. The region is drained by the major rivers like Chaliyar, Kadalundi, Bharathappuzha, Tirurpuzha, etc. canals and backwaters. The region is coconut-fringed. The coastal plain slopes towards the west very gently. The major towns including Ponnani, Edappal, Tirur, Valanchery, Kuttippuram, Tanur, Tirurangadi, and Parappanangadi lies in this region. The maximum height of this region is located at Kalpakanchery village (104 m) in Tirur Taluk.

The Malappuram undulating plain, lying parallel to the coast, makes it boundaries with Nadapuram-Mavur undulating plains to the north, Chaliyar river basin, and Perinthalmanna undulating uplands to the east, Pattambi undulating plain to the south and Malappuram coast to the west. Nenmini hill (478 m) at Kannamangalam is the highest point and the Vazhayur in the northern part (95 m) is the lowest in the region. A few hills and slopes are seen here. 

The Chaliyar River Basin makes its boundaries by Nilambur forested hills to its north and east, Perinthalmanna undulating uplands to the south, and Malappuram undulating plain to its east. It falls under the middle course of Chaliyar and has ups and downs in the form of isolated hills.

The Nilambur forested hills, also referred to as the &quot;Nilambur valley&quot; in colonial records, make its boundary with Kozhikode forested hills and Wayanad forested hills to the north, Tamil Nadu to the east, Mannarkad-Palakkad forested hills to the south, and the Chaliyar river basin to the west. It is a part of the Western Ghats. Several peaks having an elevation of more than 1000m from the sea level are seen here. The highest altitude of this region is at Mukurthi (2594 m), which lies east of the Karimpuzha Wildlife Sanctuary on the border of Kerala with Tamil Nadu. The lowest point is located at Mampad (115 m). The hilly forested area of Nilambur forms a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.

The Perinthalmanna undulating uplands make its boundary with Chaliyar river basin to the north, Mannarkad-Palakkad forested hills to the east, Palakkad Gap to the south, and Malappuram undulating plain to the west. A number of small isolated hills are seen here. Kodikuthimala is one among them. The Kadalundi River drains this region. The maximum height of the region is 610 m at Makkaraparamba.

=== Coastline ===

Malappuram ranks fifth in the length of coastline among the districts of Kerala having a coastline of 70 km (11.87% of the total coastline of the state). The coastal belt of Malappuram lies in three municipal towns, namely Tanur, Ponnani, and Parappanangadi, and eight Gram panchayats namely Vallikkunnu, Tanalur, Niramaruthur, Vettom, Mangalam, Purathur, Veliyankode, and Perumbadappu. Ponnani, Tanur, Parappanangadi, and Padinjarekkara Beach, all of which lie in the western part of the district, are the major fishing centres. The sea coast of the district is filled with marine wealth. Apart from being a favourite destination of the Arab traders earlier, Ponnani was also a captivating destination for many Muslim spiritual leaders, who were instrumental in the propagation of Islam here.

The Veṭṭathunāṭu rulers, who had the control over parts of present-day Tirurangadi, Tirur, and Ponnani Taluks, were noted patrons of arts and learning. A Veṭṭathunāṭu Raja (r. 1630–1640) is said to have introduced innovations in the art form Kathakali, which has come to be known as the &quot;Veṭṭathu Tradition&quot;.

== Notable people ==

== Demand of bifurcation ==
For a few years, the demand to create a new coastal district called Tirur district, centered at Tirur is being strengthened. They argue that it is imperative from the development perspective to split the district, with double the population and size of the Alappuzha district, into two. No other district in Kerala has seven subdistricts, 94 Village Panchayats, and 12 municipalities together. As for its extent, if one travels from Perumbadappu which borders Thrissur district to Vazhikkadavu bordering Tamil Nadu, normally it takes more than three hours to cover that distance of 115 km. They also point out that the problems in the health and educational sectors that require solutions are not trivial. The issue was raised again by the IUML MLA K. N. A. Khader in 2019. The demand is to bifurcate the existing Malappuram district into two districts by carving out a new one called Tirur district from it. Kerala Congress (M) campaigns for a new district centred at Edappal. Some people including Veteran Congress leader Aryadan Muhammad, and IUML district secretary U. A. Latheef oppose the bifurcation of Malappuram.

However, the demand was rejected by the two successive governments who ruled Kerala in 2013 and in 2019. But the studies regarding the bifurcation of the district are still in the consideration of the Government of Kerala.

<doc id="223473" wikidata="Q7560692" url="?curid=223473" title="Son of perdition">
<text>The son of perdition (Greek: ὁ υἱός τῆς ἀπωλείας, &quot;ho huios tēs apōleias&quot;) is a phrase associated with a demoniacal title that appears in the New Testament in the Gospel of John and in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians .

==New Testament==
The two occurrences of the Greek phrase have traditionally been translated consistently in English Bibles from the Wycliffe Bible, following the Latin Vulgate which has &quot;filius perditionis&quot; (son of perdition) in both instances. However this is not the case in all languages; for example the Luther Bible renders the use in John as &quot;das verlorene Kind&quot; (the lost child), but the use in 2 Thessalonians as &quot;das Kind des Verderbens&quot; (the child of corruption).

===John 17:12===
In , Jesus, in reference to Judas Iscariot, says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the &quot;son of perdition&quot;.

The New International Version translates the phrase as &quot;the one doomed to destruction.&quot; D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas&#x27; character and to his destiny.

Various Old Testament origins have been suggested for &quot;that the scripture might be fulfilled.&quot; These traditionally include Psalm 41:9 &quot;Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.&quot; Also Psalm 109:8 &quot;Let his days be few; and let another take his office.&quot; which is interpreted by Peter in Acts 1:16–20 as having been prophetic of Judas Iscariot.

===2 Thessalonians 2:3===
In 2 Thessalonians , Paul referred to &quot;the son of perdition&quot;.

He appears to equate this image with the Man of Sin.

Some scholars and theologians down through history, including Hippolytus, Luther, Wesley, Manton, Schaff, &quot;et al,&quot; say that first &quot;Son of Perdition&quot; reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Second Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying &quot;Theos Epiphanes&quot; (God manifest), &quot;etc&quot;. Even those theologians who advocate an interpretation of Daniel that includes the Roman Empire in their analysis recognize Antiochus as a prototype.

===Revelation===
Some theologians and scholars also consider &quot;the beast that goes into perdition&quot; mentioned in Revelation and to be references to the son of perdition.&quot;

==Derivation==
Similar uses of &quot;son&quot; occur in Hebrew, such as &quot;sons of corruption&quot; (Isaiah 1:4 בָּנִים מַשְׁחִיתִים banim mashchitim), however the exact Hebrew or Greek term &quot;son of perdition&quot; does not occur in Jewish writings prior to the New Testament.

According to some modern biblical criticism New Testament writers derived the &quot;son of perdition&quot; (and &quot;man of sin&quot;) concepts from Daniel and 1 Maccabees 2:48 &quot;And they did not surrender the horn to the sinner.&quot; &quot;et al.&quot; John related the &quot;Son of Perdition&quot; concepts by language, referring to &quot;the star that fell from heaven&quot; &quot;Revelation&quot; by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. (&quot;Revelation&quot; ) The Greek name is &quot;Apollyon&quot; (Greek: Aπολλυων), from the Greek root word &quot;apollumi&quot; (Greek:απολλυμι). It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation.&quot; [Strong&#x27;s &quot;622&quot;] The Hebrew name is &quot;Abaddon&quot; (Greek: Aβαδδων), from the Aramaic root word &quot;&#x27;abad&quot;, which means the same thing as the Greek root word. Strong&#x27;s 07 Daniel says that the eventual destiny of the &quot;great beast&quot; is to be slain, and his body &quot;destroyed&quot; (&#x27;abad), and given to the eternal flames (generally accepted by religious scholars to be a reference to hell).

<text>&quot;Bart the General&quot; is the fifth episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on February 4, 1990. In the episode, Bart Simpson enlists Grampa&#x27;s help to battle local bully Nelson Muntz. Bart unites the neighborhood children against Nelson and defeats him. The episode was directed by David Silverman and was the first to be written by John Swartzwelder.

==Plot==
Bart gets into a fight with Nelson Muntz, the school bully, after Nelson&#x27;s friends stomp on a box of cupcakes that Lisa baked for Miss Hoover&#x27;s birthday party. Nelson beats up Bart after school and warns him to expect the same pummeling the next day. Marge encourages Bart to reason with Nelson, but Homer urges him to bend the rules and fight dirty. Bart follows Homer&#x27;s advice but gets beaten up again. He turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa, who introduces him to Herman, the crazed one-armed proprietor of an army surplus store called Herman&#x27;s Military Antiques. After Herman teaches him military tactics, Bart declares war on Nelson and his gang of bullies.

Bart enlists all of Nelson&#x27;s other victims — nearly all of his friends and classmates — and trains them for combat. With Herman commanding from Bart&#x27;s tree house, Bart leads his forces into battle by ambushing Nelson and his minions. They commence saturation bombing with water balloons, forcing Nelson&#x27;s thugs to surrender and Nelson to be taken prisoner, who threatens to beat up Bart as soon as he is untied. Herman drafts an armistice that states that Nelson will retain his honorary position and name but not hold any actual power. After Bart and Nelson sign the treaty, Marge serves cupcakes and peace prevails.

During the epilogue, Bart tells the audience that contrary to the events of the episode, war is neither glamorous nor fun, and states that there are no winners and very few good wars. He also advises that the audience visit their local library for more information about war then wishes the audience a goodnight.

==Cast==
* Dan Castellaneta as Homer Simpson and Grampa Simpson
* Julie Kavner as Marge Simpson and Receptionist
* Nancy Cartwright as Bart Simpson, Nelson Muntz and Lewis
* Yeardley Smith as Lisa Simpson

* Pamela Hayden as Milhouse Van Houten and Boy

==Production==
This episode was running too long to use the normal opening sequence and therefore did not feature a chalkboard gag or a couch gag. Instead, it just cut to an image of the Simpson house. David Silverman was the director and was somewhat stressed, because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;. Originally, he had planned to use the song &quot;War&quot; by Edwin Starr in the episode. The plans were dropped when they decided the song did not really fit the story. John Swartzwelder wrote the episode, his first on the show. The episode had problems with the censors, who did not want the characters to say &quot;family jewels&quot; on prime time television. The producers ignored the notes and &quot;family jewels&quot; remained in the episode. This act of attempted censorship was reflected in the part where Grampa Simpson writes a letter complaining of how sexualized television has become and gives a list of words he never wants to hear on television again, one of which is the phrase &quot;family jewels&quot;.

Two new characters were introduced in this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character. Voice actress Dana Hill was originally assigned to play Nelson and was present at the table read, but not at the recording session (for unknown reasons). Nancy Cartwright was then assigned the role. The second character, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, with the exception of his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The original idea for Herman was for him to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.

==Cultural references==
The episode featured several references to war films. Several lines of dialogue, Bart slapping one of his soldiers for &quot;being a disgrace&quot;, and the music was lifted directly from the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;, composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Fox owned the rights to this film, so it was no problem to use the soundtrack. The marching sequence and the silhouettes of the children climbing the jungle gym against the setting sun are a nod to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. &quot;The Longest Day&quot; from 1962 is also referenced. The episode parodies the famous sailor kissing a girl in Times Square photograph taken on V-J Day, where a random boy in a sailor suit kisses Lisa, before she slaps him in the face. Bart concludes the episode by saying the only &quot;good wars&quot; are the American Revolution, World War II, and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Bart the General&quot; finished 31st place in the weekly ratings for the week of January 29 – February 4, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 14.3. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week.

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: &quot;Some good lines and setpieces aside – we love Bart&#x27;s fantasy of death at Nelson&#x27;s hands – this episode nevertheless feels a bit unsure of itself, particularly towards the end.&quot; In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode a3 (of 5) and called it &quot;another episode that helped to propel Bart&#x27;s popularity into the stratosphere...&quot;

Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode &quot;remains a primitive example of The Simpsons, but it&#x27;s a reasonably amusing and entertaining experience&quot;, adding that the episode &quot;lacks the subtlety and cleverness found on later episodes, but it was onto something&quot;. Matt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds it strange how controversial this episode seemed at the time of its release. Today, they would go a lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless. The episode&#x27;s reference to &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; was named the eleventh greatest film reference in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of &quot;Total Film&quot;.

===Use in scientific research===
&quot;Bart the General&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Tape&quot; were used in a Dartmouth College experiment to study brain activity in relation to humorous moments in television shows. The results were published in a 2004 issue of the academic journal &quot;Neurolmage&quot;. The researchers noted, &quot;During moments of humor detection, significant [brain] activation was noted in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus... and left inferior frontal gyrus.&quot;

==Home media==
The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled &quot;The Simpsons Collection&quot;; the episode was paired with season one episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;. It was released in the US on the VHS release &quot;The Best of The Simpsons, Vol. 2&quot; (1997), paired with &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot;. It was later re-released in the US in a collector&#x27;s edition boxed set of the first three volumes of &quot;The Best of The Simpsons&quot; collections. It was re-released in the UK as part of a VHS boxed set of the complete first season, in November 1999. The episode&#x27;s debut on the DVD format was as a part of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season one DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Brooks, and Silverman participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary. A digital edition of the series&#x27; first season, including the episode, was published December 20, 2010 in the United States through Amazon Video and iTunes.

<text>Camrose ( ) is a city in central Alberta, Canada that is surrounded by Camrose County. Located along Highway 13 it had its beginnings as a railroad hub.

== History ==
The area around Camrose was first settled by Europeans around 1900. At that time the nearby settlement of Wetaskiwin was a major centre for pioneers; typically, it was the last stopping-off point before they set out in search of nearby land. The site that was to be Camrose was about a day&#x27;s journey from Wetaskiwin along the railroad, which made it a popular place on the route of pioneers. Soon businessmen and other settlers arrived to stay. The settlers came primarily from Scandinavian countries, such as Norway and Sweden, and many settlers also came from the United States. At that time the settlement was known as the hamlet of Stoney Creek. In 1904, Stoney Creek began receiving mail service, its first businesses began to open, and its first Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer (Constable &quot;Blue&quot; Smith) arrived.

On May 4, 1905, the community was incorporated as the Village of Camrose. There is no factual evidence about the reason for the choice of the name Camrose, but it is generally thought that it was named after the Village of Camrose in Pembrokeshire, South Wales. On December 11, 1906, Camrose was incorporated as a town.

In 1906, Camrose opened its first newspaper, &quot;The Camrose Mail&quot;, which was replaced in 1908 by the &quot;Camrose Canadian&quot;, which was published until 2018. In March 1907 the town erected a building for town administration, which also held its first police and fire station. In May 1907, it spent $10,000 on its schoolhouse. In October 1907 men from Alberta Government Telephones set up Camrose&#x27;s first telephone exchange, and by 1908 about fifty residents had telephone access. 1911 saw the construction of Camrose&#x27;s first power plant.

From 1905 to 1914, there was a great deal of railway construction in the Camrose area. Camrose became a bit of a railroad hub, sitting on railways that connected to Edmonton and Calgary, as well as many of the smaller towns in central Alberta, such as Vegreville, Stettler, Drumheller, and Wetaskiwin. By 1914, twelve passenger trains came through Camrose daily. In those days the growth of Camrose was strongly linked with the railway.

On June 26, 1912, the first building of the Camrose Lutheran College (known as Augustana University College from 1991 to 2004) was opened. Today the campus continues as the Augustana Faculty of the University of Alberta.

During World War II, the Camrose Fairgrounds were converted to an army training grounds. About ten H-Shaped huts were built, as were mess quarters, a medical building and a storehouse. Thousands of Canadian boys came to Camrose to receive their basic training.

Camrose became a city on January 1, 1955. By 1958, Camrose had converted the old post office into the new city hall. In 1954, however, Camrose had sold the old town hall to the federal government, so in the interim the city council met for almost three years in the hall of the local Methodist Church.

Camrose has continued to expand, even as the significance of the railroads waned. It is now stretching out along Highway 13, and is becoming a major stop for travellers along that road. With the advent of the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose it has become even more oriented towards tourism and hospitality.

Camrose was host to an Alberta Music Camp for upwards of 40 years, named MusiCamrose, until it later changed to MusiCamp Alberta, now hosted in Red Deer. It celebrated its 50th anniversary in the summer of 2007. It was founded by Peterkin.

On October 26, 2005, a single lottery ticket worth $54,000,000 (the second largest in Canadian history) was sold in Camrose. The ticket belonged to 17 oil industry workers.

In August 2006, Camrose held a Founders Day when four men were inducted as founding fathers of Camrose.

Camrose is known colloquially as the &quot;Rose City&quot; due to the large number of wild roses which grow in the surrounding parklands. Developed to withstand the Alberta climate, the Camrose Rose was introduced to the city in 1995. Local rose grower Jerry Twomey bred and patented this variety of rose to honour his birthplace. The variety may be seen on display at the Bill Fowler Centre.

* Jubilee Park is often used by the community, located in a valley and featuring barbecue shelters, a wandering stream and wide open space.
* Mirror Lake sits in the centre of the city. Once a reservoir for the electrical plants which powered the city, the man-made lake was later home to two species of swan: the trumpeter and the Polish mute. The City of Camrose provided a winter shelter to the clipped birds. These swans called Camrose home for over twenty years. In September 2019, City Council voted to end the swan program due primarily to ethical concerns of keeping wild animals confined for five to six months a year, as well as managing offspring and trading the birds every three years.
*Mirror Lake Park is the focal point of the Camrose urban parks system. Located on the edge of Mirror Lake, it is the home of the Bill Fowler Centre which contains the Chamber of Commerce office and the Tourist Information Centre. The Bill Fowler Centre features a nature mural, carved out of red brick. The mural features many of the animals which are indigenous to the Mirror Lake area.
* Mirror Lake flows from Stoney Creek, which wanders through the city, and provides a river valley for viewing wildlife through paved walking paths.

== Government ==
The current mayor in Camrose is PJ Stasko, and Malcolm Boyd is the city&#x27;s manager. The Camrose City Council is made up of the mayor and eight elected councillors, all at large. The current MP is Damien Kurek, and the current MLA is Jackie Lovely.

=== Camrose Police Service ===
The Camrose Police Service (CPS) is the municipal law enforcement agency for the City of Camrose. Planning for Camrose&#x27;s first municipal police service began in 1955 after incorporating as a city. The CPS officially began operating on July 1, 1956 with Howard Martin serving as its first chief of police. Its current chief of police is Dean LaGrange.

==Infrastructure ==
Camrose is served by Camrose Airport.

Camrose&#x27;s water supply comes from nearby Driedmeat Lake.

== Education ==

=== Secondary ===
Three authorities provide secondary schooling in Camrose, including the Battle River School Division (BRSD), Conseil Scolaire Centre-Nord (CSCN) and Elk Island Catholic Schools (EICS). The BRSD operates 37 schools in Camrose and the surrounding area. EICS operates one elementary school (St. Patrick Catholic School) and one junior/senior high-school (Our Lady of Mount Pleasant Catholic School). CSCN operates one school (École des Fondateurs).

=== Post-secondary ===
The primary post-secondary institution in Camrose is the Augustana Faculty of the University of Alberta (formerly known as Augustana University College). Established in 1910 by Norwegian settlers, under the name Camrose Lutheran College.

In 2006, the university celebrated its first fourth generation graduate.

Camrose also hosts the &quot;Canadian Lutheran Bible Institute&quot;, and formerly &quot;Gardner College &quot;(previously known as Gardner Bible College and Alberta Bible Institute).

== Media ==
Camrose is served by two local papers. Formerly, the weekly &quot;Camrose Canadian&quot;, was published up until August 9, 2018 when its parent company announced that it was ceasing production. The weekly &quot;Camrose Booster&quot; and the small daily, &quot;Camrose Morning News&quot;. There is also a local Christian paper published monthly called &quot;Crosswalk&quot;.

Camrose is also home to two radio stations. The first is AM station 840 CFCW. Despite having a studio in West Edmonton Mall, CFCW still has its main broadcast studio in Camrose.

The second station is the much-newer FM station, New Country 98.1. Both stations are owned by Stingray Radio.

== Sister cities ==
The City of Camrose has twinning agreements with several similar communities in Canada and around the world. These relationships are developed in part with a mind toward promoting goodwill, education, economic and tourist benefits.

<text>Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization II is a turn-based strategy video game in the &quot;Civilization&quot; series, developed and published by MicroProse. It was released in 1996 for PCs, and later ported to the PlayStation by Activision.

Players build a civilization from a primitive tribe, competing with rival computer- or human (in some editions)-controlled civilizations. They manage cities and units in a quest to assure their civilization&#x27;s dominance—either by conquering all other civilizations or by manufacturing advanced space technology.

&quot;Civilization II&quot; was a commercial hit, with sales of around three million units by 2001, and has won numerous awards and placements on &quot;best games of all time&quot; lists. It was followed by &quot;Civilization III&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
As a turn-based strategy game, &quot;Civilization II&quot; models the historical development of human civilization. A player, when creating a game, may pick one of 21 historical civilizations or a custom-named civilization. The computer will intelligently control multiple rival civilizations. Only a single-player mode was available until the release of the Multiplayer Addon. 

The following civilizations appear in the game: Americans, Aztecs, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Celts, English, Egyptians, French, Germans, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Japanese, Mongols, Persians, Romans, Russians, Sioux, Spaniards, Vikings and Zulus. Barbarians are non-playable NPC characters.

The game takes place on a map made of tiles. A human player may generate a random map based on his specifications, or opt for a pre-made map. Different terrain types, special resources and improvements such as irrigation are present on different tiles. Players begin with one or a few units, including settlers to found their first cities, in 4000 BC. All of the map is unexplored except the starting units&#x27; immediate vicinity, and exploration is a top early-game priority.

Cities occupy one tile and harvest yields from nearby tiles: food, trade and production. They may build units, city improvements or wonders of the world. Typically, each civilization will constantly expand by founding new cities until all of the map is settled. Analogous to chess pieces, the many different units vary in their functions, mirroring historical types of soldiers and occupations. Units occupy one tile at a time and may move every turn. Most of them can attack others in battle; a minority have non-military functions.

After civilizations make contact, they begin diplomatic relations. In war, a civilization may conquer another civilization&#x27;s cities. When all of a player&#x27;s cities are conquered, they are permanently removed from the game. To end war, two players may promise peaceful relations.

Scientific research is a focal point of the game. Players begin with primitive technology and hence limited possible actions. Grouped by eras from ancient to modern, civilization advances, both scientific and societal, offer numerous advantages.

There are three paths to victory: conquering all other civilizations, building a spaceship that reaches the Alpha Centauri star system using advanced technology, and otherwise surviving until 2020 AD. A player&#x27;s score is calculated after finishing the game.

===Other features===

&quot;Civilization II&quot; supports mods that customize game graphics or mechanics. &quot;Scenarios&quot; are preset game files that emulate historical, fictional or other situations.

===Differences from &quot;Civilization&quot;===

&quot;Civilization II&quot; is similar to its predecessor &quot;Civilization&quot;, with some changes to and additions of units, civilizations, world wonders, tile &quot;specials&quot; and technologies. Entirely new concepts include diplomatic reputation and production waste. The world map was changed from a top-down view to an isometric representation. The artificial intelligence for the human player&#x27;s opponents was also improved.

==Development==

&quot;Civilization II&quot; was designed by Brian Reynolds, Douglas Caspian-Kaufman and Jeff Briggs. Following the success of &quot;Civilization&quot;, the ongoing development of a sequel was kept secret for years. The game was publicly announced when the team was in the final stage of tweaking and balancing. The game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Civilization 2000&quot;. Asked about Sid Meier&#x27;s involvement in the project, Reynolds replied, &quot;We sat down and brainstormed about it and hashed out ideas, that&#x27;s about it.&quot; Emulating the recently released &quot;Doom&quot;, Reynolds implemented support for modding despite Meier&#x27;s fear that customers would blame the company for poor-quality mods.

Meier commented, &quot;&quot;Civilization&quot; greatly favored the military approach to achieving victory. We&#x27;ve now adjusted the balance to make trade and diplomacy a more integral part of the game&quot;.

On the PC &quot;Civilization II&quot; was developed for Windows 3.1 and later using the WinG API. The later released &quot;Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition&quot; required Windows 95, and no longer ran on Windows 3.1.

==Release==
=== Re-release ===
The game was re-released on December 9, 1998 as Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition, which bundled the two prior expansion packs and added options for multi-player games, among other tweaks with the disadvantage that it required Windows 95 and later, while the original Civilization 2 version worked in Windows 3.1. The &quot;Multiplayer Gold Edition&quot; was included in the &quot;Civilization Chronicles&quot; box set released in 2006.

===Expansion sets===
There were two expansion packs that slowly added more features to the game. The first, Conflicts in Civilization, included 20 new scenarios: 12 created by the makers of the game, and eight &quot;Best of the Net&quot; by fans. It also added an enhanced macro language for scenario scripting with advanced programming features such as variable typing and network features, which was considered widely unnecessary. Due to a programming bug, the &quot;Encarta&quot;-style Civilopedia was disabled from the game.

The second expansion was Civ II: Fantastic Worlds. It also added new scenarios that had many unique settings such as one scenario dealing with colonization of Mars, and one scenario called Midgard that had Elven, Goblin, Merman, and other civilizations from fantasy. There are also some scenarios based on other MicroProse games such as &quot;X-COM&quot;, &quot;Master of Orion&quot; and &quot;Master of Magic&quot; &quot;Jr.&quot; scenarios. &quot;Fantastic Worlds&quot; also contains a new scenario editor that allowed users to edit the statistics and icons used for units, city improvements, terrain, and technologies, as well as creating event triggers and other enhancements to the game.

===Remake===
The remake &quot;Civilization II: Test of Time&quot; was released in 1999, following &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;. &quot;Test of Time&quot; has a new palette and user interface, and new features such as animated units, a playable Alpha Centauri to settle and new campaign modes.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Civilization II&quot; placed second on PC Data&#x27;s monthly computer game sales chart for April 1996. The game secured position 3 for the next four months, before dropping to No. 5 in September. It exited PC Data&#x27;s top 10 in December, after remaining there for an additional two months. In the United States, &quot;Civilization II&quot; was the third-best-selling computer game of the first six months of 1996, and the fifth-highest seller of the year as a whole. Worldwide, its sales surpassed 400,000 copies by August, reached 500,000 in September and topped 600,000 by November. In the United States alone, it sold 482,522 units and earned $21.1 million by the end of 1996.

By mid-January 1997, global sales of &quot;Civilization II&quot; had surpassed 720,000 copies. It finished 20th on PC Data&#x27;s monthly chart for March, and was the United States&#x27; 17th-highest-selling computer game of the year&#x27;s first half. The game had topped its predecessor&#x27;s 850,000 sales that August, and continued to sell &quot;over 20,000 units a month&quot; by November, according to Microprose. &quot;Civilization II&quot; reached 1.2 million units sold by April 1998; Terry Coleman of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote that sales were &quot;still going strong&quot; at that time. In the United Kingdom alone, the game sold 160,000 units by 1999. It also received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) in August 1998, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. &quot;Civilization II Gold&quot; alone sold 171,495 copies in the United States by September 2000, according to PC Data.

In August 2001, Jeff Briggs of Firaxis estimated that &quot;Civilization II&quot; had sold &quot;about 3 million&quot; copies. Meier said that he was &quot;wrong on all counts&quot; about opposing mod support; &quot;The strength of the modding community is, instead, the very reason the series survived&quot;.

===Critical reviews===
On release, a reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; ventured that &quot;Civilization II&quot; &quot;may be one of the most balanced and playable games ever released.&quot; He especially praised the added depth of the combat, diplomatic relations, and trade over the original &quot;Civilization&quot;, which he said was one of the best games ever released for PC. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave it the Strategy Game of the Year award, and &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named it the overall game of the year, calling it and its predecessor &quot;perhaps the finest strategy games ever made.&quot; &quot;Civilization II&quot; was nominated as &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; 1996 game of the year, although it lost to &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. However, it won the magazine&#x27;s award for the best turn-based strategy game of the year. It also won a Spotlight Award for Best PC/Mac Game. &quot;Macworld&quot; Michael Gowan wrote, &quot;Hard-core strategists will enjoy this game&#x27;s complexity.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Overall, &quot;Civ II&quot; remains one of strategy gaming&#x27;s finest hours and is a welcome addition on PlayStation. For those who are willing, it&#x27;s a game of limitless possibilities.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Civilization II&quot; was ranked as third in IGN&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest video games of all time, having previously rated it at number 15 in 2003. In 2012, G4tv ranked it as the 62nd top video game of all time. Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the most addictive game &quot;that stole our childhood&quot;. The journal article &quot;Theoretical Frameworks for Analysing Turn-Based Computer Strategy Games&quot; deemed it &quot;significant and influential&quot;. In Ted Friedman&#x27;s essay &quot;Civilization and its Discontents: Simulation, Subjectivity, and Space&quot; from the collection &quot;Discovering Discs: Transforming Space and Genre on CD-ROM&quot;, he argues that the game &quot;simultaneously denies and de-personalizes the violence in the history of &#x27;exploration, colonization, and development&quot;. &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; deemed it a &quot;worthy successor&quot; to Civilization, and &quot;arguably the finest multiplayer game ever created&quot;. In anticipation to the launch of &quot;Civilization III&quot;, &quot;New Straits Times&quot; described &quot;Civilization II&quot; as &quot;the best turn-based empire- building strategy game&quot;. &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; was &quot;obsessed with the game&quot;. &quot;Tribune Business News&quot; deemed it an &quot;old favorite&quot;. The game was the fourth bestseller in October 1996 and the 3rd bestseller in December 1997. &quot;PC Games&quot; argued that the game &quot;cemented the franchise&#x27;s place in videogame history.&quot;

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 2nd-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;intelligent, engrossing and entertaining beyond compare, it&#x27;s one of the finest artistic achievements of the last decade&quot;. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked the game sixth in a list of the top 100 games of all time, writing: &quot;&quot;Civ 2&quot; could well be one of the world&#x27;s most addicting games.&quot;

==Legacy==
Several other games have been heavily inspired by &quot;Civilization II&quot;. In 2006, an N-Gage version of &quot;Civilization&quot; was released, based on &quot;Civilization II&quot; and its successor &quot;III&quot;. The open-source game &quot;Freeciv&quot; has a &quot;ruleset&quot; that is virtually identical to &quot;II&quot;&#x27;s mechanics.

In 2011, researchers at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the University College London published the results of a machine learning system playing &quot;Civilization II&quot;, in its &quot;Freeciv&quot; implementation, which used the text from its official game manual to guide its strategy. The linguistically informed player outperformed its language-unaware counterpart, winning over 78% of games when playing against the built-in AI, a 27% absolute improvement. The same group also showed that their &quot;non-linear Monte-Carlo search wins 80% of games against the handcrafted, built-in AI&quot;.

In June 2012, the Reddit user &quot;Lycerius&quot; posted details of his decade-long &quot;Civilization II&quot; game, since dubbed &quot;The Eternal War&quot;. The viral story spread to many blogs and news sites. The game closely mimicked social conditions in the dystopian novel &quot;1984&quot; of George Orwell, with three superpowers engaged in perpetual multiple-front total warfare.

<text>Thomas Davenport (July 9, 1802 – July 6, 1851) was a Vermont blacksmith who, with his wife Emily, constructed the first American DC electric motor in 1834.

==Biography==
Davenport was born in Williamstown, Vermont. He lived in Forest Dale, a village in the town of Brandon.

As early as 1834, he developed a battery-powered electric motor, along with his wife Emily Davenport. They used it to operate a small model car on a short section of track, paving the way for the later electrification of streetcars. It is the first attempt to apply electrification to locomotion.

Davenport&#x27;s 1833 visit to the Penfield and Taft iron works at Crown Point, New York, where an electromagnet was operating, based on the design of Joseph Henry, was an impetus for his electromagnetic undertakings. Davenport bought an electromagnet from the Crown Point factory and took it apart to see how it worked. Then he forged a better iron core and redid the wiring, using silk from his wife&#x27;s wedding gown.

With his wife Emily and colleague Orange Smalley, Davenport received the first American patent on an electric machine in 1837, U. S. Patent No. 132. In 1840, he printed &quot;The Electro-Magnetic and Mechanics Intelligencer&quot;, making it the first magazine to be printed with electricity.

In 1849, Charles Grafton Page, the Washington scientist and inventor, commenced a project to build an electromagnetically powered locomotive, with substantial funds appropriated by the US Senate. Davenport challenged the expenditure of public funds, arguing for the motors he had already invented. In 1851, Page&#x27;s full sized electromagnetically operated locomotive was put to a calamity-laden test on the rail line between Washington and Baltimore.

<doc id="223493" wikidata="Q5043061" url="?curid=223493" title="Carlton Television">
<text>Carlton Television (now part of the non-franchised ITV London region) was the ITV franchise holder for London and the surrounding counties from 9.25am every Monday to 5.15pm every Friday. The company is now managed with London Weekend Television as a single entity (ITV London), but the two companies are still separately licensed. The station is owned and operated by ITV plc under the licensee of &quot;ITV Broadcasting Limited&quot;. Carlton has been branded on air as &quot;ITV1&quot; since 28 October 2002 (&quot;ITV&quot; between 14 January 2013 and 14 November 2022). Carlton Television Ltd, the original holder of the licence (renamed Carlton Broadcasting Limited on 1 February 1997), has since been dissolved. Carlton UK Television Limited however is now known as ITV Consumer Limited and legally operates ITV plc&#x27;s websites. As Carlton&#x27;s name has no relation to its region, its on-screen identity has been completely removed (along with those of HTV, LWT and GMTV). Other regions have kept their original company name as a region name and in their local news name.

==Formation==
Carlton Television was originally set up by Michael Green&#x27;s Carlton Communications to bid for an ITV franchise after Green failed to buy into Thames Television, the London franchise, in 1985. On 16 October 1991, Carlton won the &quot;Channel 3&quot; franchise to broadcast to London during weekdays from January 1993, as a result of winning the silent auction used to renegotiate the new ITV franchises. Thames bid £32.5M, while Carlton Television placed a bid of £43.2M and CPV-TV placed a bid of £45.3M. CPV-TV was the highest bidder, but was eliminated for failing the quality threshold; since both Thames and Carlton were deemed to have passed the quality threshold, the franchise was awarded to Carlton for having submitted the higher cash bid of the remaining two companies. Carlton also bid for the South and South East franchise, losing to Meridian Broadcasting. Some commentators consequently speculated that Thames had fallen victim to a &quot;government vendetta&quot;, whilst others felt that the auction had been won fairly.

Carlton did not buy Thames&#x27; studios, instead having its headquarters in St Martin&#x27;s Lane in the West End and opting to rent transmission space at LWT&#x27;s London studios. Also, unlike Thames which had been both a production company and a broadcaster, Carlton chose to commission all of its programming from independent production companies.

===Launch===
Carlton Television took over from Thames at stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) 1993, broadcasting from a newly opened playout centre managed by London News Network, a subsidiary company co-owned by Carlton and London Weekend Television from LWT&#x27;s facilities on the South Bank in London.

At the stroke of midnight, following ITN&#x27;s &quot;Into The New Year&quot; bulletin featuring the Westminster clock tower chimes, technicians at the Crystal Palace transmitter switched from Thames&#x27; Euston Road headquarters to the LNN playout centre from where Carlton went on-air with an opening ident featuring the then Town Crier of London, with the then-famous slogan of Carlton, &quot;This is Carlton Television for London&quot;, ringing the bell three times, and the first announcement from continuity announcer Graham Bannerman. He started the first continuity announcement for Carlton with these words: &quot;And a very Happy new year. Welcome to 1993, and our first programme live from Trafalgar Square, here&#x27;s Chris Tarrant with A Carlton New Year.&quot; The station&#x27;s first programme was the entertainment special &quot;A Carlton New Year&quot;, produced in-house and presented by Chris Tarrant. After the special, the movie &quot;Best Defense&quot;, which starred Dudley Moore and Eddie Murphy, aired, which began after Carlton&#x27;s second ident, with the Cadets of the Royal Navy, saying the slogan, was shown. Idents from 1993 to 1994 had the slogan: &quot;This is Carlton. Television for London.&quot;, &quot;This is Carlton&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re watching Carlton.&quot;

Unlike Thames, which had been both a broadcaster and a production company, Carlton chose to commission most of its programming from independent production companies although its contract to hold the ITV franchise licence disallowed the company to commission all programming so Carlton still had to produce a minimal amount of programming in-house.

The first Carlton-produced programme to be broadcast nationally was &quot;Surprise Party&quot;, effectively the same format as &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, previously a mainstay of predecessor Thames Television. Hosted by Michael Parkinson, the first celebrity to be the subject of the show was entrepreneur Richard Branson. At the end of the hour-long show, Michael Parkinson told viewers to keep their eyes out for another &quot;Surprise Party&quot;. However, no further programmes were ever made.

Alarm bells had been ringing before Carlton even transmitted as part of the ITV network, as one notable commission with wide publicity was &quot;The Good Sex Guide&quot;, inviting scorn and derision from conservative newspapers, before it had actually been broadcast. Aptly, its first commercial break featured an advert for the Vauxhall Carlton.

==Broadcasting==
In May 1994, the Independent Television Commission criticised a number of ITV stations as part of its review for the first 12 months of the new franchise in 1993. Carlton Television was condemned for providing a wide range of &#x27;unimpressive and very disappointing&#x27; programmes for the ITV network, which were &#x27;neither distinctive nor noticeable high quality&#x27;. This criticism came after Carlton and Granada secretly planned to axe &quot;News at Ten&quot; in the chase for ratings, a move which was foiled by the ITC. Carlton, angered by this criticism, responded: &#x27;In the first year, Carlton launched 43 brand new series and 20 new single programmes, sustained audience levels and played a full part in ITV network; successes far outweighed failures.&#x27; A few days later, Carlton won two awards from the Royal Television Society&#x27;s &#x27;programme and tech awards&#x27; in London; Margie Clarke was named &#x27;Best Female Presenter&#x27; for Carlton&#x27;s &quot;The Good Sex Guide&quot;; while &quot;Old Bear Stories&quot; won the Children&#x27;s Entertainment award.

During a 1994 review, ITC commented that Carlton had made improvements, in its factual and drama output, while its children&#x27;s programmes were &#x27;impressive&#x27;, but more remained to be achieved. In 1995, its regional programming was regarded as high quality but with few innovations; &quot;The Good Sex Guide&quot; was guilty of breaching taste and decency requirements with little educational classifications, which resulted in the company receiving two written warnings from the ITC. Once again, in 1997, Carlton was criticised for failing to ensure its programming complied with the programmes code, while the number of formal interventions from the ITC had increased from four in 1995 to eight; but its regional programming continued to be of high quality.

===Factual inaccuracy in 1996 documentary===
Carlton found itself at the centre of a major controversy about truthfulness in broadcast journalism in May 1998, when &quot;The Guardian&quot; carried a series of articles alleging the wholesale fabrication of a much-garlanded 1996 documentary, &quot;The Connection&quot;, which had purported to film the route by which heroin was smuggled into the United Kingdom from Colombia. An internal inquiry at Carlton found that the allegations made by &quot;The Guardian&quot; were in large part correct, and the then-regulator of the industry, the ITC, punished Carlton with a record fine of £2 million for multiple breaches of the UK&#x27;s broadcasting codes. The scandal led to an impassioned debate about the accuracy of documentary production.

===Expansion===
Changes in legislation concerning media ownership enabled Carlton to buy out many of the other ITV stations, including Central Independent Television, Westcountry, and part of HTV (via Granada), as well as the rights to the archives of ITC Entertainment and its former sister company ATV. Rank Film Distributors, including its library of 740 films, was purchased by Carlton in 1997 for £65 million. HTV was the only region owned by Carlton not to be subject to a full on-screen rebrand as &#x27;Carlton&#x27;. Both &#x27;HTV West&#x27; and &#x27;HTV Wales&#x27; stayed with their then-current idents; however, upon Carlton&#x27;s purchase, the animated introduction and music to the idents were replaced by the sequences and audio in use with Carlton&#x27;s graphical package. However, the logo and end-board of the ident remained unchanged, using the generic hearts look of 1999. Carlton also did not acquire most of HTV&#x27;s production facilities; these were retained by Granada.

The ITC archive is financially lucrative, since it includes such popular series as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, and &quot;The Saint&quot;, as well as such feature films as &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. Carlton released much of the Rank library on video and DVD via its own label in the UK, and via A &amp; E Home Video, Acorn Media, MGM Home Entertainment, and Lions Gate Home Entertainment in the USA. A large number of these films were screened on Carlton&#x27;s digital movie channel, Carlton Cinema; however, it closed in March 2003. The merger with Granada led to the use of the Carlton name falling into disuse, and Carlton Video became part of Granada Ventures.

===ITV Digital ===

In 1997, Carlton formed a partnership with Granada and BSkyB to bid for some of the multiplexes for the new digital terrestrial network. In June of that year, it was successful in its application, and began the service, OnDigital, under the condition BSkyB withdrew from the group. OnDigital was rebranded as ITV Digital in 2001, before its collapse in 2002.

==Merger and unification==

In September 2002, Carlton and Granada, having now acquired all the franchises in England and Wales, made the decision to remove all regional idents, continuity and branding, and replace them with the single brand, ITV1. English regional idents were to only precede regional programming, and regional announcements were pre-recorded from London (Wales gets on-screen recognition prior to all programming, see &quot;ITV1 Wales&quot;). Unlike Granada-owned regions, Carlton used dual-branding on its regional idents with the Carlton logo, so the Carlton Westcountry and Carlton Central regions were simply known as &quot;ITV1 Carlton&quot;. Granada-owned franchises preferred simply to place text of the region name under the ITV1 logo. This went on until December 2003, when Carlton dropped the practice, resulting in changing the brands from &quot;Carlton Central&quot; to &quot;ITV1 for Central England&quot;, from &quot;Carlton Westcountry&quot; to &quot;ITV1 for the Westcountry&quot;. The HTV regions were re-branded &quot;ITV1 Wales&quot; and &quot;ITV1 West of England&quot; in 2002.

On 2 February 2004, Carlton Communications plc merged with Granada plc, creating ITV plc, which now owns all of the ITV franchises in England and Wales under the &quot;ITV1&quot; brand (Wales still uses its own on-screen identity as ITV1 Wales, but now also uses English ITV1 continuity since 16 January 2006). The three English Carlton ITV regions were reverted to their previous names: &quot;ITV1 for Central England&quot; again became &quot;ITV1 Central&quot;, &quot;ITV1 West of England&quot; became &quot;ITV1 West&quot; and &quot;ITV1 for the Westcountry&quot; became &quot;ITV1 Westcountry&quot;, prior to regional programming in their respective areas.

===ITV London===
Since 28 October 2002, Carlton Television (in common with all the other ITV companies, except Scottish Television, Grampian Television, Ulster Television and Channel Television) has been known on air simply as ITV1 (London Weekdays). Unlike London Weekend Television, Carlton Television did not note the last day (25 October) of its regional identity on-air. However, the Carlton brand continued to be seen on production captions until 2004. Since Carlton and London Weekend Television now use identical presentation and logos, the division between the London weekday and weekend franchises is now invisible, although the old LWT - now ITV1 (London Weekends) - does have &quot;London Weekend Weather&quot;, which is sponsored by a different company to that of London weekdays.

With the merger of Carlton and Granada, Carlton Television and LWT are now run as a single entity (ITV London), with a single management team appointed to both companies. Both continue to have a separate legal existence however, and still have separate licences, although this is now just a formality.

Upon merger, Carlton lost recognition to programmes made by their companies, which became branded as &quot;Granada&quot; and the relevant area, for example, all programmes made in London became branded as &quot;Granada London&quot;. From 16 January 2006, all programmes produced by any ITV plc owned region were branded as ITV Productions and in 2009 this became ITV Studios.

==Studios==

Carlton was a publisher broadcaster who never made any of its own programming itself. Carlton productions that required studio space were booked at Lenton Lane when Carlton bought Central Independent Television in 1994, obtaining the company&#x27;s Nottingham studios and gained the in-house production arm. The studios were booked by independent production companies.

Carlton was originally based in a small office building in St. Martin&#x27;s Lane in Central London, with transmission being provided by London News Network, a company jointly owned with LWT and based at The London Studios that also provided a seven-day news service.

Following the creation of ITV plc in 2004, Carlton&#x27;s office in St Martin&#x27;s Lane was vacated and the operations transferred to The London Studios, albeit as part of the ITV plc operations housed there. ITV London&#x27;s news operation moved to ITN on 1 March 2004. The transmission operation moved to the HD Technicolor Playout Centre at Chiswick.

==Identity==

===Launch ident===
Carlton&#x27;s on-screen identity was launched on 1 January 1993 with an ident package featuring London personalities. These people, who lived and worked in the capital would appear against a brightly coloured background with the Carlton logo in the top left corner, and would say the phrase, &quot;This is Carlton, television for London&quot;, or other variations of the theme. In excess of sixty idents were produced and used from 1993. This was replaced by a single montage of individuals used from later on from 6 December 1993 until 1 September 1995.

===1995===
On 4 September 1995, a new in-house look was launched featuring changing backgrounds of colours with a translucent Carlton logo in the centre of the screen, becoming opaque and white at the end of the ident. These idents lasted until 22 November 1996, but were deemed not exciting or brash enough for Carlton executives.

===1996===
Lambie-Nairn devised the new set on 25 November 1996, featuring the Carlton logo against a brightly coloured background and various animations occurring. This could be interaction between other letters in the name, letters being replaced by objects, or the letters becoming part of something larger, such as a crossword of places in London. Thirty sequences were produced, including some designed especially to introduce certain programmes, and versions for Central were also introduced two years later on 27 April 1998.
These idents were used until 3 September 1999.

===1999===
On 6 September 1999, Carlton&#x27;s boldest rebrand yet occurred, and it was also to be its last. While Granada and UNM regions were about to adopt the &quot;Hearts&quot; generic look, Carlton refused the look and instead adopted a package that related back to the Hearts, but put their own distinct take on it. Lambie-Nairn was once again commissioned, and a dozen idents were produced and were used depending on the programme to go before it. The idents featured opening films featuring a heart shape, before a star shaped light is emitted from the heart shape, before the screen changes to the Carlton logo, now with added star in top right corner, against a spinning stars background of different colours, with ITV logo beneath. This look has received criticism, not concerning the idents themselves, but because these idents replaced the brands used by both Central and Westcountry. The idents were later partially adopted by HTV following its sale to Carlton, with the opening films from said look, although with the HTV logo and ITV Hearts ending slide being retained.

==Other ventures==

Between 1996 and 2003, Carlton owned a number of extra channels, carried initially on analogue cable, and also later on their flagship platform, ONdigital too, although none of them ever made it onto Sky Digital. However, three closed in 2000; and all five were closed by 2003. Most were closed due to funding issues and lack of loyal viewership. They all time-shared on three EPG positions. Carlton Food Network and Carlton Select shared a channel, Carlton Kids, Carlton World, and another channel named &#x27;RAW!&#x27; shared the second. Carlton Cinema received an EPG position of its own, but would be periodically closed down to provide bandwidth for &quot;On Sport 2&quot; during the ONdigital days.

===Carlton Cinema===
Carlton Cinema was the Carlton channel which showed classic movies, but also unusually for a movie channel, cartoons. This ceased transmission on 31 March 2003, the last of the five Carlton channels to do so.

===Carlton Select===
Carlton Select was the main entertainment channel from Carlton, and broadcast both in the UK and Africa. It time-shared with the Carlton Food Network, and ceased transmission in March 2000.

===Carlton World===
Carlton World was a general entertainment and factual channel broadcast in the evenings, with sister channel Carlton Kids broadcast in the daytime. This ceased transmission in February 2000.

===Carlton Kids===
Carlton Kids was a children&#x27;s channel and showed most of all of Carlton&#x27;s children&#x27;s imports, and programming from Carlton&#x27;s regions. Time-shared with Carlton World, it ceased transmission in January 2000.

===Carlton Food Network===
Carlton Food Network was the Carlton channel devoted to cookery, and time-shared with Carlton Select. It was later rebranded &quot;Taste CFN&quot;, and ceased transmission in December 2001.

<text>Tapping is a playing technique that can be used on any stringed instrument, but which is most commonly used on guitar. The technique involves a string being fretted and set into vibration as part of a single motion. This is in contrast to standard techniques that involve fretting with one hand and picking with the other. Tapping is the primary technique intended for instruments such as the Chapman Stick.

==Description==

Tapping is an extended technique, executed by using either hand to &#x27;tap&#x27; the strings against the fingerboard, thus producing legato notes. Tapping generally incorporates pull-offs or hammer-ons. For example, a right-handed guitarist might press down abruptly (&quot;hammer&quot;) onto fret twelve with the index finger of the right hand and, in the motion of removing that finger, pluck (&quot;pull&quot;) the same string already fretted at the eighth fret by the little finger of their left hand. This finger would be removed in the same way, pulling off to the fifth fret. Thus the three notes (E, C and A) are played in quick succession at relative ease to the player.

While tapping is most commonly observed on electric guitar, it may apply to almost any string instrument, and several instruments have been created specifically to use the method. The Bunker Touch-Guitar (developed by Dave Bunker in 1958) is designed for the technique, but with an elbow rest to hold the right arm in the conventional guitar position. The Chapman Stick (developed in the early 1970s by Emmett Chapman) is an instrument designed primarily for tapping, and is based on the &quot;Free Hands&quot; two-handed tapping method invented by Chapman in 1969 where each hand approaches the fretboard with the fingers aligned parallel to the frets. The Hamatar, Mobius Megatar, Box Guitar, and Solene instruments were designed for the same method. The NS/Stick and Warr Guitar are also built for tapping, though not exclusively. The harpejji is a tapping instrument which is played on a stand, like a keyboard, with fingers typically parallel to the strings rather than perpendicular. All of these instruments use string tensions less than a standard guitar, and low action to increase the strings&#x27; sensitivity to lighter tapping.

==History==


Tapping has existed in some form or another for centuries. Niccolò Paganini (1782-1840) used similar techniques on the violin, striking the string with a bouncing bow articulated by left-hand pizzicato. Paganini considered himself a better guitarist than violinist, and in fact wrote several compositions for guitar, most famously the &quot;Grand Sonata for Violin and Guitar.&quot; His guitar compositions are rarely performed in modern times, though his violin compositions enjoy multiple performances. Some musicologists believe he wrote his 37 violin sonatas on guitar and then transcribed them for violin. Well known to frequent taverns, Paganini was likely exposed to gypsy guitar techniques from Romani, &quot;gypsies.&quot; He preferred playing his guitar for tavern customers instead of concert hall audiences.

Similar to two-hand tapping, &quot;selpe&quot; technique is used in Turkish folk music on the instrument called the &quot;bağlama&quot;.

Tapping techniques and solos on various stringed acoustic instruments such as the banjo have been documented in film, records, and performances throughout the early 20th century. Various musicians have been suggested as the originators of modern two-hand tapping. While one of the earliest players known to use the technique was Roy Smeck (who used a tapping style on a ukulele in the 1932 film &quot;Club House Party&quot;), electric pickup designer Harry DeArmond developed a two-handed method as a way of demonstrating the sensitivity of his pickups. His friend Jimmie Webster, a designer and demonstrator for Gretsch guitars, made recordings in the 1950s using DeArmond&#x27;s technique, which he described in the instructional book &quot;Touch Method for Electric and Amplified Spanish Guitar&quot;, published in 1952.

Vittorio Camardese developed his own two-handed tapping in the early 1960s, and demonstrated it in 1965 during an Italian television show.

Tapping was occasionally employed by many 1950s and 1960s jazz guitarists such as Barney Kessel, who was an early supporter of Emmett Chapman.

In August 1969, Chapman developed a new way of two-handed tapping with both hands held perpendicular to the neck from opposite sides, thus enabling equal counterpoint capabilities for each hand. To maximize the technique, Chapman designed a 9-string long-scale electric guitar which he called &quot;the Electric Stick&quot; (and later refined as the Chapman Stick), the most popular dedicated tapping instrument. Chapman&#x27;s style aligns the right-hand fingers parallel to the frets, as on the left hand, but from the opposite side of the neck. His discovery led to complete counterpoint capability, and a new instrument, the Chapman Stick, and to his &quot;Free Hands&quot; method. Chapman influenced several tapping guitarists, including Steve Lynch of Autograph, and Jennifer Batten.

The tapping technique began to be taken up by rock and blues guitarists in the late 1960s. One of the earliest such players was Canned Heat guitarist Harvey Mandel, whom Ritchie Blackmore claims to have seen using tapping onstage as early as 1968 at the Whisky a Go Go. George Lynch has corroborated this, mentioning that both he and Edward Van Halen saw Mandel employ &quot;a neo-classic tapping thing&quot; at the Starwood in West Hollywood during the 1970s. Mandel would use extensive two-handed tapping techniques on his 1973 album &quot;Shangrenade.&quot; Another early example of the tapping technique can be heard in Terry Kath&#x27;s &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; from Chicago&#x27;s debut album in 1969. 

Randy Resnick (of the band Pure Food and Drug Act, which at one time also featured Mandel) used two-handed tapping techniques extensively in his performances and recordings between 1969 and 1974. Resnick was mentioned in the Edward Van Halen biography for his contribution to the two-handed tapping technique. In reference to Resnick&#x27;s playing with Richard Greene And Zone at the Whisky a Go-Go in 1974, Lee Ritenour mentioned in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine January 1980 that &quot;Randy was the first guitarist I ever saw who based his whole style on tapping.&quot; Resnick also recorded using the technique in 1974 on the John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers album &quot;Latest Edition&quot; and has said that he was attempting to duplicate the legato of John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Sheets of Sound&quot;.
Steve Hackett of Genesis also claims to be an inventor of tapping as early as 1971.

Some players such as Stanley Jordan, Paul Gilbert, Buckethead, and Steve Vai were notably skilled in the use of both hands in an almost piano-like attack on the fretboard.
In the mid 1970s two-handed tapping started to break into the mainstream, when Frank Zappa started incorporating it into his songs, and performing them to large TV audiences. Edward Van Halen went on to popularize the two-handed tapping technique in the late 1970s. Van Halen claims that his own inspiration came from Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page: &quot;I think I got the idea of tapping watching (Page) do his &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; solo back in 1971… He was doing a pull-off to an open string and I thought… I can do that, but what if I use my finger as the nut and move it around?&quot;

==Techniques==
===Two-handed tapping===
Tapping can be used to play polyphonic and counterpoint music on a guitar, making available eight (and even nine) fingers as stops. For example, the right hand may fret the treble melody while the left hand plays an accompaniment. Therefore, it is possible to produce music written for a keyboard instrument, such as J.S. Bach&#x27;s Two-part Inventions.

The main disadvantage to tapping is reduced range of timbre, and in fact it is common to use a compressor effect to make notes more similar in volume. As tapping produces a &quot;clean tone&quot; effect, and since the first note usually sounds the loudest (unwanted in some music like jazz), dynamics are a main concern with this technique, though Stanley Jordan and many Stick players are successful in this genre.

Depending on the orientation of the player&#x27;s right hand, this method can produce varying degrees of success at shaping dynamics. Early experimenters with this idea, like Harry DeArmond, his student Jimmie Webster, and Dave Bunker, held their right hand in a conventional orientation, with the fingers parallel with the strings. This limits the kind of musical lines the right hand can play. The Chapman method puts the fingers parallel to the frets.

===One-handed tapping===
One-handed tapping, performed in conjunction with normal fingering by the fretting hand, facilitates the construction of note intervals that would otherwise be impossible using one hand alone. It is often used as a special effect during a shredding solo. With the electric guitar, in this situation the output tone itself is usually overdriven — although it is possible to tap acoustically — with drive serving as a boost to further amplify the non-picked (and thus naturally weaker) legato notes being played.

The overall aim is to maintain fluidity and synchronization between all the notes, especially when played at speed, which can take extensive practice to master.

===Pick tapping===
Some guitarists may choose to tap using the sharp edge of their pick instead of fingers to produce a faster, more rigid flurry of notes closer to that of trilling, with a technique known as pick tapping or pick trilling. Using the pick enables faster speeds by means of &#x27;vibrating&#x27; (or effectively seizing up) the wrist Guitarists such as Joe Satriani and John 5 Lowery have been known to use it, with Lowery nicknaming it a &quot;Spider-Tap&quot;.

===Tapped harmonics===
Tapped harmonics are produced by holding a note with a player&#x27;s fretting hand, and tapping twelve frets down from that note with the player&#x27;s tapping hand (i.e. the note on the 4th fret of the A string is tapped on the 16th fret of the A string). Rather than hammering-on and pulling-off with the right hand, harmonics are produced by hitting the fret with a finger. This method of tapping can be heard in Van Halen&#x27;s songs &quot;Women In Love&quot; and &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot;. Early Metallica bassist Cliff Burton also utilized tapped harmonics on bass guitar on his noted instrumental piece &quot;(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth&quot;.

<doc id="223497" wikidata="Q216100" url="?curid=223497" title="Ian Anderson">
<text>Ian Scott Anderson (born 10 August 1947) is a British musician best known for being the chief vocalist, flautist and acoustic guitarist of the British rock band Jethro Tull. He is a multi-instrumentalist who also plays harmonica, keyboard, bass guitar, bouzouki, balalaika, saxophone and a variety of whistles. His solo work began with &quot;Walk into Light&quot; in 1983; since then he has released another five albums, including the sequel to the 1972 Jethro Tull album &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, titled &quot;TaaB 2: Whatever Happened to Gerald Bostock?&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
Ian Anderson was born in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, the youngest of three brothers, to an English mother and a Scottish father. Anderson said, &quot;I am a Brit. I&#x27;m a Brit. I see myself as a product of that union.&quot; His father, James Anderson, ran the RSA Boiler Fluid Company in East Port, Dunfermline. Anderson&#x27;s family moved to Edinburgh when he was three. He was influenced by his father&#x27;s big band and jazz records and the emergence of rock music, but was disenchanted with the &quot;showbiz&quot; style of early American rock and roll stars like Elvis Presley.

Anderson&#x27;s family moved in 1959 to Blackpool, England, where he was educated at Blackpool Grammar School. In a 2011 interview, Anderson said he was asked to leave grammar school for refusing to submit to corporal punishment (permitted at that time). He studied fine art at Blackpool College of Art from 1964 to 1966 while living in Lytham St Annes.

==Career==

===Early career===
While a teenager, Anderson took a job as a sales assistant at Lewis&#x27;s department store in Blackpool, then as a vendor on a news stand.

In 1963, Anderson formed The Blades from among school friends: Michael Stephens (guitar), John Evan (keyboards), Jeffrey Hammond (bass) and Barriemore Barlow (drums). This was a soul and blues band, with Anderson on vocals, guitar and harmonica; he had yet to take up the flute. They played their first show at the Holy Family Church Hall in North Shore.

In late 1967, Anderson was still holding down a day job, namely cleaning the Ritz Cinema in Luton, including the toilets, in the mornings, &quot;which took me half the day&quot; he said in a later interview. He took an old, chipped urinal from the cinema storeroom and had it for a time after leaving the job. It was not, however, the urinal which &quot;was bolted to the side of John Evan&#x27;s Hammond organ on stage&quot; and figured in early 1970s Tull performances.

At this time, Anderson abandoned his ambition to play electric guitar; this was allegedly because he felt he would never be &quot;as good as Eric Clapton&quot;. As he himself tells it in the introduction to the video &quot;Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970&quot;, he traded his electric guitar in for a flute which, after some weeks of practice, he found he could play fairly well in a rock and blues style. According to the sleeve notes for the first Tull album, &quot;This Was&quot; (1968), he had been playing the flute only a few months when the album was recorded. His guitar practice did not go to waste either, as he continued to play acoustic guitar, using it as a melodic and rhythmic instrument. As his career progressed, he added soprano saxophone, mandolin, keyboards and other instruments to his arsenal.

His tendency to stand on one leg while playing the flute came about by accident, as he had been inclined to stand on one leg while playing the harmonica, holding the microphone stand for balance. Anderson became known for his famous one-legged flute stance, and was once referred to as a &quot;deranged flamingo&quot;. This stance is on many album covers of Jethro Tull. During a long stint at the Marquee Club, a journalist described him, wrongly, as standing on one leg to play the flute, when in fact he was originally playing the harmonica on one leg. He decided to live up to the reputation, albeit with some difficulty. His early attempts are visible in &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; (1968) film appearance of Jethro Tull. This was referenced in the facetious liner notes for &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; in a quote about &quot;the one-legged pop flautist, Ian Anderson&quot;.

===Later career===
Anderson already wished to start a solo career in 1980, when Jethro Tull was going to take a break after John Glascock&#x27;s death. He wrote the album &quot;A&quot; as a solo record, but had Jethro Tull&#x27;s Martin Barre participating, and Dave Pegg on bass. Record company pressure forced the record to be released under the Jethro Tull name. His first official solo album was &quot;Walk into Light&quot;, in 1983, in which Peter-John Vettese played an important role in the electronic direction of the music.

In the 1990s, he began working with simple bamboo flutes. He uses techniques such as over-blowing and hole-shading to produce note-slurring and other expressive techniques on this otherwise simple instrument. Anderson said that around this time his daughter began taking flute lessons and noticed his fingering was incorrect, prompting him to relearn his extensive catalog with the right fingering. In 1995, Anderson released his second solo album, &quot;&quot;, an instrumental work composed of twelve flute-heavy pieces pursuing varied themes with an underlying motif. The album was recorded with Jethro Tull keyboard player Andrew Giddings and orchestral musicians. Anderson released two further song-based solo albums, &quot;The Secret Language of Birds&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Rupi&#x27;s Dance&quot; in 2003. In 2003, Anderson recorded a composition called &quot;Griminelli&#x27;s Lament&quot;, in honour of his friend, the Italian flutist .

In 2011, with the end of Jethro Tull touring, and the question of his friend Derek Shulman (whatever happened to Gerald Bostock?), Anderson began to produce a sequel to &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972), titled &quot;Thick as a Brick 2&quot; or &quot;TAAB2&quot;, was released on 3 April 2012. It is billed as being performed by Jethro Tull&#x27;s Ian Anderson instead of being a Jethro Tull album proper. Anderson toured performing both albums in their entirety. A trailer for &quot;TAAB2&quot; was posted on YouTube.

Anderson released a new album, &quot;Homo Erraticus&quot;, in May 2014. He described it as a progressive rock concept album blending rock, folk, and metal music. Peaking at No. 14 in the UK Albums Chart it is his most successful ever solo album.

In September 2017, Anderson announced plans for a tour to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;This Was&quot;, and a new studio album in 2019. The band line-up includes Anderson, Hammond, John O&#x27;Hara, David Goodier (all musicians of Anderson&#x27;s solo band since 2012), and, since 2019, Joe Parrish, with Barre and Florian Opahle absent from the lineup.

On 2 January 2018, Ian Anderson published a New Year post on jethrotull.com, including a picture of Anderson with the caption &quot;IA in the studio working on a new album for release March 2019. Shhhh; keep it a secret...&quot;

On 1 June 2018, Parlophone Records released a new (50-track) career collection celebrating the Jethro Tull&#x27;s 50th anniversary featuring all 21 Tull albums, named &quot;50 for 50&quot;. In the notes of the &quot;50 for 50&quot; booklet it stated that the new album scheduled for 2019 (and later pushed back to 2020, then 2022) would be a solo record by Ian Anderson and not a new album by Jethro Tull. However, that turned out not to be true; the band released &quot;The Zealot Gene&quot;, the first Jethro Tull studio album in 19 years (and the first with all new, original material in 23 years), on 28 January 2022.

==Recognition==

In 1973, Anderson appeared, along with several other artists, on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, for an article about new directions in early 1970s music.

In recognition of his lifelong contribution to popular music, Anderson received two honours in 2006: the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement and an honorary Doctorate of Literature at Heriot-Watt University, on 11 July 2006.

Anderson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to music.

He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Letters) from Abertay University in July 2011.

At the 2013 Progressive Music Awards, Anderson was presented with the &quot;Prog God&quot; award.

==Musical collaborations and other work==
Anderson produced Steeleye Span&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;, as well as appearing on and producing Steeleye Span member Maddy Prior&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Woman in the Wings&quot; (1978), for which Jethro Tull made most instrumental contributions.

Anderson appeared as a guest on the song &quot;All Along You Knew&quot; from &quot;The Big Prize&quot; (1985), the second album by Canadian rock band Honeymoon Suite. This followed Jethro Tull&#x27;s 1984 tour, on which Honeymoon Suite was one of the opening acts. Also in 1984, Anderson, along with Martin Barre, Dave Pegg and Peter-John Vettese recorded album &quot;A Classic Case&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra, performing a selection of music from Jethro Tull. He was also a DJ on radio station Planet Rock, presenting his own two-hour show &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. He also appeared on stage with Joe Bonamassa playing Jethro Tull song &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot; at the Hammersmith Apollo in May 2010.

Anderson plays flute on the Men Without Hats song &quot;On Tuesday&quot; from their album &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot; (1987), and on the Blackmore&#x27;s Night song &quot;Play, Minstrel, Play&quot; from their debut album &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; (1997).

Anderson plays flute on the 1998 Roy Harper album &quot;The Dream Society&quot;. Anderson has acknowledged Harper as having a strong influence upon him.
Anderson performs as a special guest on two Uriah Heep live albums: &quot;Acoustically Driven&quot; (2001) and &quot;Electrically Driven&quot; (2001), on both performing the same two songs of Uriah Heep repertoire: &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;Blind Eye&quot;.

Anderson plays flute on the track &quot;Portmeirion&quot; on Fairport Convention&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;XXXV&quot;. Anderson has performed with Fairport Convention at their annual Cropredy Festival on several occasions since the mid-1980s, when their bass player Dave Pegg was also a member of Jethro Tull.

Anderson played flute and sang lead vocals on a version of &quot;The Thin Ice&quot; for the 2005 album &quot;Back Against the Wall&quot;, an all-star tribute album covering Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; in its entirety.

In April 2011, Anderson performed a flute duet with astronaut Cady Coleman, during her mission aboard the International Space Station, in honour of the 50th anniversary of the first crewed spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin.

Anderson played the flute on the track &quot;Cannonball&quot; by The Darkness on their 2012 album, &quot;Hot Cakes&quot;. He played the flute on the track &quot;Cry to the World&quot; by Renaissance on their 2013 album, &quot;Grandine il vento&quot;. He also played the flute on &quot;The Ocean at the End&quot;, the title track from The Tea Party&#x27;s 2014 album.
Anderson contributed flute on the song &quot;Black Cherry Pie&quot;, the third single from JEFF the Brotherhood&#x27;s 2015 album, &quot;Wasted on the Dream&quot;.

On 24 March 2017, the studio album &quot;Jethro Tull – The String Quartets&quot; by Anderson was released, featuring the Carducci String Quartet, conducted by John O&#x27;Hara.

The official video for Marc Almond&#x27;s song &#x27;Lord of Misrule&#x27;, taken from his 2020 album &quot;Chaos and a Dancing Star&quot; was released on YouTube on 29 November 2019, featuring Ian Anderson playing flute throughout.

In 2024, Anderson appeared on Swedish progressive rock and metal band Opeth&#x27;s album &quot;The Last Will and Testament&quot;. Anderson played flute on tracks &quot;§4&quot;, &quot;§7&quot;, and &quot;A Story Never Told&quot;. Anderson also provided spoken word passages on tracks &quot;§1&quot;, &quot;§2&quot;, &quot;§4&quot;, and &quot;§7&quot;.

==Family and personal life==
Anderson is the youngest of three brothers. The oldest of the three, Robin, became administrator of Scottish Ballet in 1973.

From 1970 to 1974, Anderson was married to Jennie Franks, a photographer who is credited with some of the lyrics to the first couple of verses of the song &quot;Aqualung&quot;.

Anderson married Shona Learoyd in 1976, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as a &quot;beautiful convent-educated daughter of a wealthy wool manufacturer&quot;. She had studied ballet for 10 years; however, when Anderson met her, she was working as a press officer at Jethro Tull&#x27;s then-record label, Chrysalis Records. She later became involved with the band&#x27;s on-stage special effects.

The couple have lived in a 16th-century redbrick farmhouse on the Pophleys Estate in Radnage, England, in Kilmarie House on their Strathaird Estate on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as a short time in Montreux, Switzerland. They currently live in Wiltshire, England, and have another house in Switzerland, near Montreux. They have two children: James Duncan Anderson, also a musician; and Gael, who works in the film industry and is married to actor Andrew Lincoln, star of the US TV drama series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

Anderson is a survivor of deep vein thrombosis, and has done several public service announcements to raise awareness of the disease.

Anderson lists his interests as protecting wild cats, especially those that have been rescued from harsh captivity; cameras, chiefly Leicas; and Indian cuisine.

Anderson has described his religious beliefs as being &quot;somewhere between deist and pantheist&quot;. He opposes &quot;prejudice, xenophobia and hard right conservatism&quot;, while also criticising &quot;wokeness&quot;, calling it a &quot;trendy and overworked&quot; viewpoint that &quot;can all-too-easily stifle the process of the direct exchange of views&quot;. He is an avid environmentalist and has long believed in human-induced climate change, and regularly grows hardwood trees on his farm to help reduce his carbon footprint.
During a video interview for &quot;The Big Interview with Dan Rather&quot; in May 2020, Anderson said he was suffering from the incurable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after being diagnosed a number of years previously. Although Anderson had been a cigarette and pipe smoker until he quit the habit in the 1990s, he believed that a likely cause of this condition was the use of on-stage smoke machines in live performances throughout his long career. Anderson continued medication to treat the condition, avoided areas of high pollution to prevent exacerbation of the disease, and practised breathing exercises to keep his lungs fit, stating that COPD had otherwise not yet affected his day-to-day routine.

==Other business activities==
Anderson has owned several salmon farms in the UK and Chile. His Strathaird concern, based on his estate on the Isle of Skye, operated until the late 1990s, when parts of it were sold off.

Anderson is a director of four companies: Jethro Tull Production Limited, Calliandra Productions Limited, Ian Anderson Limited, and the Ian Anderson Group of Companies Limited.

<text>War Admiral (May 2, 1934 – October 30, 1959) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse and the fourth winner of the American Triple Crown. He was also the 1937 Horse of the Year and well known as the rival of Seabiscuit in the &quot;Match Race of the Century&quot; in 1938. War Admiral won 21 of his 26 starts with earnings of $273,240 and was the leading sire in North America for 1945. He was also an outstanding broodmare sire whose influence is still felt today in descendants such as Triple Crown winners American Pharoah and Justify.

==Background==
War Admiral raced as a homebred for Samuel D. Riddle, who also owned Man o&#x27; War. War Admiral was foaled at Faraway Farm in Lexington, the offspring of Man o&#x27; War and Brushup. Man o&#x27; War was widely regarded as the greatest American racehorse of his time, but Brushup never won a race. They were bred together six times, producing five undistinguished fillies and one Triple Crown winner.

War Admiral inherited his father&#x27;s talent, but did not resemble him physically. At , or 15.3 he was smaller than Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s height of 16.3 hands. War Admiral&#x27;s dark brown coat was inherited from his dam, who also contributed to War Admiral&#x27;s smaller size as she was under 15 hands. Because of his size, one of War Admiral&#x27;s nicknames was The Mighty Atom. Others referred to him simply as The Admiral.

Most sources say that War Admiral inherited his sire&#x27;s fiery temperament, which manifested chiefly in his reluctance to load in the starting gate. Away from the crowds though, he was more relaxed and given to taking long naps. His groom called him sweet, and his trainer, George Conway, found him more like his dam in terms of personality. Conway was in a position to know as he had been stable foreman to Louis Feustel while the latter trained Man o&#x27; War. Conway stayed with Riddle after Feustel&#x27;s retirement, and trained several of Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s most successful offspring. War Admiral&#x27;s regular jockey was Charles Kurtsinger.

==Racing career==
===1936: Two-year-old season===
As a two-year-old in 1936, War Admiral won three of six races including the Great American Stakes and Eastern Shore Handicap. However, the star of this crop was then considered to be Pompoon, who defeated War Admiral in the National Stallion Stakes. War Admiral was rated at 121 pounds on the Experimental Free Handicap, seven pounds below two-year-old champion Pompoon and seventh overall.

===1937: Three-year-old season===
In 1937, War Admiral started his three-year-old campaign by winning two races at Havre de Grace, including the Chesapeake Stakes. Riddle then made a fateful decision. In 1920, Man o&#x27; War was not entered in the Kentucky Derby as Riddle did not like racing outside of New York and Maryland, and also felt the distance of the Derby was too great for three-year-olds so early in the season. For War Admiral, Riddle made an exception and made the trip west to Churchill Downs in Louisville. War Admiral went off as the favorite, and, despite delaying the start for several minutes, won in wire-to-wire fashion with Pompoon lengths back in second. Neville Dunn, sports editor for the &quot;Lexington Herald&quot;, wrote, &quot;A little brown horse that takes after his mammy in size but runs like his daddy charged to victory in the 63rd Kentucky Derby… and he won so easily, so effortlessly, that 65,000 fans nudged one another in the ribs and said, &#x27;I told you so! I told you that War Admiral could run like Man o&#x27; War.&#x27;&quot;

The Preakness Stakes was held just a week later. After again acting up at the start, War Admiral went to the lead early but had trouble negotiating the turns. Pompoon saved ground along the rail and closed alongside War Admiral as they exited the last turn. The two horses dueled down the stretch with War Admiral finally prevailing by a head.

On June 5, War Admiral faced six rivals in the Belmont Stakes, going off as the 4-5 favorite. He was particularly fractious at the start, repeatedly breaking through the barrier. After delaying the start for eight minutes, he stumbled leaving the gate. He quickly recovered his stride and won the race by three lengths with &quot;speed to spare&quot;. His time of 2:28 tied the American Record for miles, while breaking Man o&#x27; War&#x27;s track record by a fifth of a second. War Admiral thus became the fourth winner of the American Triple Crown. But the victory came at a price: War Admiral had struck the quarter of his right front fore-foot when stumbling at the gate, which left a gaping wound. During the race, his jockey did not notice that anything was amiss. But when led into the winner&#x27;s circle, his connections found that his belly and legs were covered with blood.

The injury was severe enough to cause War Admiral to miss the summer racing season. He returned in October to win three more races, including the Washington Handicap and the inaugural Pimlico Special. All told, in 1937 War Admiral won eight of eight races including the Triple Crown. He was the unanimous selection as Champion 3-Year-Old, and also earned the title of Horse of the Year in a close battle with Seabiscuit, the Champion older horse.

===1938: Four-year-old season===
In 1938, War Admiral won eight major races, including the Whitney Handicap and Jockey Club Gold Cup. He is linked forever with the year-older Seabiscuit, who was a grandson of Man o&#x27; War and the preeminent horse based in the western U.S. Seabiscuit&#x27;s owner, Charles Howard, brought his horse across country to give Seabiscuit the chance to prove himself to the eastern racing establishment. Seabiscuit and War Admiral almost faced each other several times that summer but for one reason or another, they never met. Finally, a meeting was arranged for November 1, 1938, in the Pimlico Special in what was billed as The Match Race of the Century. Samuel Riddle asked that the race be run without a starting gate in light of War Admiral&#x27;s problematic history. With War Admiral&#x27;s early speed, he was widely seen to have a tactical advantage in a match race and went off as the favorite. However, Seabiscuit&#x27;s trainer had secretly conditioned his horse to bolt at the sound of a starting bell, which resulted in Seabiscuit getting the all-important early lead. Seabiscuit won by four lengths and broke the track record.

War Admiral raced twice more, winning the Rhode Island Handicap in 1938 and a race at Hialeah in February 1939 before an injury prompted his retirement.

==Stud career==
War Admiral stood at Faraway Farm until 1958, when the executors of Riddle&#x27;s estate sold the remaining portion of the farm. War Admiral was then moved to Hamburg Place, where he died in 1959.

War Admiral was the leading American sire in 1945 and the leading juvenile sire in 1948. Before his 1959 death, War Admiral sired 40 stakes winners. Major winners sired by War Admiral include champion Blue Peter, Bee Mac, Navy Page, Cold Command, and Admiral Vee. As a sire, War Admiral is perhaps best known for his success with daughters of La Troienne. This cross produced the champion filly and Horse of the Year Busher (ranked #40 in &quot;Blood-Horse&quot; magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century), as well as stakes winners Searching, Busanda and Mr. Busher.

Although War Admiral&#x27;s sire line no longer exists, he remains a significant influence in modern pedigrees due to his daughters. He was the Leading broodmare sire of 1962 and 1964. Descendants in the female line include the likes of Swaps, Buckpasser, and Numbered Account, as well as two Triple Crown winners, Seattle Slew and Affirmed. Other descendants of note include Dr. Fager, Alysheba, Cigar and Zenyatta. War Admiral&#x27;s name appears eight times in the pedigree of the 2015 Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah.

==Honors and awards==
War Admiral was elected to the Hall of Fame in the same year as arch-rival Seabiscuit. In &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; ranking of the top 100 US thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, War Admiral was ranked #13, with Seabiscuit as #25.

In 1937, Riddle commissioned equine artist Martin Stainforth to paint War Admiral&#x27;s portrait, a version of which can be found in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

War Admiral is buried alongside his sire at the foot of the Man o&#x27; War statue in the Kentucky Horse Park.

==In popular culture==
The 2003 movie &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; features the match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral. The film portrays War Admiral at 18 hands even though War Admiral and Seabiscuit were about the same size with Seabiscuit standing at 15.2 hands and outweighing War Admiral

<text>Jane Francesca Agnes, Lady Wilde (née Elgee; 27 December 1821 – 3 February 1896) was an Irish poet who wrote under the pen name Speranza and supporter of the nationalist movement. Lady Wilde had a special interest in Irish folktales, which she helped to gather and was the mother of Oscar Wilde and Willie Wilde.

==Life==

=== Early life === 
Jane was the last of the four children of Charles Elgee (1783–1824), the son of Archdeacon John Elgee, a Wexford solicitor, and his wife Sarah (née Kingsbury, d. 1851). Her mother came from a prosperous Protestant family in Dublin and was considered a great beauty. Jane was the youngest of four children of the couple, her older siblings being Emily, John, and Frances (died as an infant)

She claimed that her great-grandfather was an Italian surnamed Algiati which was said to be a derived from Alighieri thus inferring a relationship with the famous poet. This ancestor was said to have had come to Wexford in the 18th century; in fact, the Elgees descended from Durham labourers who had gained prosperity as builders and bricklayers and then in succeeding generations became part of the gentry.

Her maternal aunt Emily was married to the author Charles Maturin though his death two years before her own birth precluded her ever meeting him, but whose bust Jane would display in her home as an adult. Another aunt, Elizabeth, was married to the politician Sir Charles Montagu Ormsby while her paternal aunt and namesake Jane Elgee was the mother of the arctic explorer Robert McClure who discovered the Northwestern passage.

Jane&#x27;s father died at Bangalore, India when she was just three years old leaving her mother to raise her and her siblings. The family moved to Wexford where they lived in modest circumstances.

==== Youth ====

As a young woman Jane was considered a beauty with dark eyes jet-black hair and tall in stature. Her education was undertaken by a succession of governesses and tutors. She is said to have mastered ten languages by the age of 18 under the instruction of Richard Waddy Elgee, her paternal uncle.

Jane&#x27;s brother John emigrated to the United States when she was just nine years old. He became a lawyer and a judge in Louisiana. Jane, her mother, and older sister Emily, moved back to Dublin to live at Lower Leeson Street No. 34.

Her older sister, Emily, would go on to marry an officer and after his appointment as Deputy Quartermaster General of Jamaica would live most of her married life abroad in the West Indies. Jane&#x27;s brother-in-law being an English officer caused a strain between the sisters on account of Jane&#x27;s nationalism. The sisters remained distant even after Emily&#x27;s return to Britain.

Jane and her mother continued to live on Leeson Street. In 1849 Elgee translated the gothic tale &quot;Sidonia the Sorceress&quot; (1847) by Willhelm Meinhold from German into English.

Jane met William Wilde, either as a patient or through literary circles, near the end of the 1840s. Jane reviewed Wilde&#x27;s book, The Beauties of the Boyne, and Its Tributary, the Blackwater (1849)

== Marriage ==

On 12 November 1851 she married Sir William Wilde, an eye and ear surgeon (and also a researcher of folklore), in St. Peter&#x27;s church in Dublin, and they would go on to have three children: William Charles Kingsbury Wilde (26 September 1852 – 13 March 1899), Oscar Fingal O&#x27;Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900), and Isola Francesca Emily Wilde (2 April 1857 – 23 February 1867). Her eldest son William Wilde became a journalist and poet, her younger son Oscar Wilde became a prolific and famous writer, and her daughter Isola Wilde died in childhood of a fever. Jane was the grandmother of Oscar&#x27;s sons Cyril and Vyvyan Holland, and of Willie&#x27;s daughter Dorothy Wilde.

Before their marriage Wilde had also fathered three illegitimate children, Henry Wilson, Emily and Jane. The son, who was raised by an uncle of Wilde, later became an assistant to his father and the Wilde children considered him a cousin. There are indications that Wilde was unfaithful to his wife throughout their marriage. 

The family first made their home at Westland Row before moving to No 1, Merrion Square in 1855. Merrion Square was a fashionable area of Dublin. After the birth of her daughter Isola, Jane made the acquaintance of the Swedish noblewoman Charlotte &quot;Lotten&quot; von Krämer who was one of her husbands patients. The two women discovered that they shared an interest in literature, culture and women&#x27;s rights.

This also inspired her to try and learn Swedish to be able to read the Swedish journals von Krämer sent her, though she never mastered it fully. In 1859 when her oldest son William was six years old he was given a governess which enabled Jane and her husband to travel abroad. They toured Scandinavia and visited Stockholm which Jane stated that she would &quot;never enjoy any place again so much&quot; She would later compile her journals detailing her experiences into a travelbook &quot;titled &quot;Driftwood from Scandinavia&quot;&quot; (1884) which gained moderate success.

== Widowhood ==
When her husband died in 1876, the family discovered that he was virtually bankrupt. Jane Wilde - now Lady Wilde, following the knighting of her husband in 1864 - joined her sons in London in 1879. She lived with her older son in poverty, supplementing their meagre income by writing for fashionable magazines and producing books based on the research of her late husband into Irish folklore. She wrote several books including &#x27;Ancient legends, mystic charms, and superstitions of Ireland&#x27; (1887). Her poems are said to have influenced her son Oscar&#x27;s own work. For example, his &#x27;Ballad of Reading Gaol&#x27; has been compared to her poem &#x27;The Brothers&#x27; (based on a true story of a trial and execution in the 1798 Rebellion).

In January 1896 Lady Wilde contracted bronchitis and, dying, asked for permission to see Oscar, who was imprisoned in Reading Gaol. Her request was refused. It was claimed that her &quot;fetch&quot; (i.e. her apparition) appeared in Oscar&#x27;s prison cell as she died at her home, 146 Oakley Street, Chelsea, on 3 February 1896. Her funeral was held on 5 February at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. It was paid for by Oscar, as her older son, Willie Wilde, was penniless. She was buried anonymously in common ground without a headstone. In 1996 she was memorialised in the form of a plaque on the grave of Sir William Wilde in Dublin as &#x27;Speranza of The Nation, writer, translator, poet and nationalist, author of works on Irish folklore, early advocate of equality for women, and founder of a leading literary salon&#x27;. In 1999, a monument to her, in the form of a Celtic cross, was erected at Kensal Green Cemetery by the Oscar Wilde Society. (It is located at grid square 147 – Cambridge Avenue South (near Canalside), set back 20 metres from the curved path – opposite SQ.148.)

==Activist==

Lady Wilde was the niece of Charles Maturin and wrote for the Young Ireland movement of the 1840s, publishing poems in &quot;The Nation&quot; under the pseudonym of &quot;Speranza&quot;. Her works included pro-Irish independence and anti-British writing; she was sometimes known as &quot;Speranza of the Nation&quot;. Charles Gavan Duffy was the editor when &quot;Speranza&quot; wrote commentary calling for armed revolution in Ireland. The authorities at Dublin Castle shut down the paper and brought Charles Duffy to court but he refused to name the person who had written the offending article. &quot;Speranza&quot; reputedly stood up in court and claimed responsibility for the article. While the confession was ignored by the authorities, they permanently shut the newspaper down.

Jane was an early advocate of women&#x27;s rights, and campaigned for better education for women. She invited the suffragist Millicent Fawcett to her home to speak on female liberty. She praised the passing of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act of 1883, which prevented a woman from having to enter marriage &#x27;as a bond slave, disenfranchised of all rights over her fortune&#x27;.

Through her friendship with Charlotte von Krämer she would also make the acquaintance of the Swedish feminist activist and writer Rosalie Olivecrona.

==Scandals==

In 1864 Sir William and Lady Wilde were at the centre of a sensational Dublin court case regarding a young woman called Mary Travers, the daughter of a colleague of Sir William&#x27;s and a long-time patient. Travers claimed that Sir William had drugged her with chloroform and raped her in 1862; when Lady Wilde wrote a letter to Travers&#x27;s father contesting the allegations, Mary sued her for libel. Mary Travers won the case, although she was only awarded a farthing for damages plus costs. The costs, however, amounted to £2,000.

<text>Emily Goss Davenport Weeks (April 29, 1810October 5, 1862) was an American inventor from Vermont. Together with her husband Thomas Davenport, they invented an electric motor and electric locomotive around 1834.

Davenport kept detailed notes and actively contributed to the process of the inventions. Needing to insulate the motor&#x27;s iron core, Davenport cut her wedding dress into strips of silk to insulate the wire windings. She is also credited with the idea of using mercury as a conductor, enabling the motor to function for the first time. With her husband Thomas, and colleague Orange Smalley, she received the first American patent on an electric machine in 1837, U. S. Patent No. 132. This electric motor was used in 1840 to print &quot;The Electro-Magnet, and Mechanics Intelligencer&quot; - the first newspaper printed using electricity.

She was born Emily Goss in Brandon Vermont, one of five children born to Rufus Goss a local merchant and Anna Green. She and Thomas Davenport lived in Salisbury, Vermont and had two children, George Daniel Davenport and Willard Goss Davenport. Thomas Davenport died in 1851 and Emily moved to Middlebury. On January 6, 1856 she married John Mosely Weeks in Salisbury, the inventor of the Vermont beehive. She died in 1862 and is buried in Pine Hill Cemetery in Brandon, Vermont.

<doc id="223503" wikidata="Q1504942" url="?curid=223503" title="Hammer-on">
<text>A hammer-on is a playing technique performed on a stringed instrument (especially on a fretted string instrument, such as a guitar) by sharply bringing a fretting-hand finger down on to the fingerboard behind a fret, causing a note to sound. This technique is the opposite of the pull-off.

Passages in which a large proportion of the notes are performed as hammer-ons and pull-offs instead of being plucked or picked in the usual fashion are known in classical terminology as &quot;legato&quot; phrases. The sound is smoother and more connected than in a normally picked phrase, due to the absence of the necessity to synchronize the plucking of one hand with the fingering on the fingerboard with the other hand; however, the resulting sounds are not as brightly audible, precisely due to the absence of the plucking of the string, the vibration of the string from an earlier plucking dying off.

The technique also facilitates very fast playing because the picking hand does not have to move at such a high speed, and coordination between the hands only has to be achieved at certain points. Multiple hammer-ons and pull-offs together are sometimes also referred to colloquially as &quot;rolls&quot;, a reference to the fluid sound of the technique.

A hammer-on is usually represented in guitar tablature (especially that created by computer) by a letter h.

A rapid series of alternating hammer-ons and pull-offs between a single pair of notes is called a trill.

The term &quot;hammer-on&quot; was first invented and popularized by Pete Seeger in his book &quot;How to Play the 5-String Banjo&quot;. Seeger also invented the term &quot;pull-off&quot;.

In the Banjo tutor book &quot;Ellis&#x27;s Thorough School For 5 String Banjo&quot; published prior to 1900, the term &#x27;Hammer on&#x27; is used to describe the action of performing an embellishment called &#x27;the Shake&#x27;. The description is &quot;The Shake, which is marked &#x27;tr&#x27;, is played in the following manner. Strike(pick) the first note only with the right hand &amp; the remainder of the passage with the 2nd finger of the left hand, by &#x27;hammering on&#x27; the string while it is vibrating&quot;. In the same tutor book, the action &#x27;pull off&#x27; is termed the &#x27;snap&#x27;.
