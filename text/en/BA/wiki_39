<text>Juan Ruiz de Alarcón (c. 1581 – 4 August 1639) was a New Spanish writer of the Golden Age who cultivated different variants of dramaturgy. His works include the comedy &quot;La verdad sospechosa&quot; (es), which is considered a masterpiece of Latin American Baroque theater.

== Family ==
Juan Ruiz de Alarcón was born in Real de Taxco, later named Taxco de Alarcón in his honour. His family was of old Asturian nobility. The name &quot;Alarcón&quot; had been given to his ancestor Ferren Martínez de Ceballos by Alfonso VIII of Castile after he had successfully driven the Moors from the fortress of Alarcón near Cuenca in 1177. Juán Ruiz de Alarcón&#x27;s maternal grandparents Hernando and María de Mendoza were among the first Spaniards to arrive in Mexico in 1535, when they established themselves in Taxco. Their daughter Leonor de Mendoza married Pedro Ruiz de Alarcón who was described as an hidalgo.

Juan Ruiz de Alarcón had four brothers: Pedro Ruiz de Alarcón, who was rector at the College of Saint John Lateran, Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón who was a priest and is known for having written a treatise documenting the non-Christian religious practices of the Nahua Indians of central Mexico, Gaspar and García, about whom little is known.

==Life==

Juan Ruiz de Alarcón was born about 1581 at Real de Taxco, New Spain, where his father was superintendent of mines; his mother was descended from one of Spain&#x27;s most illustrious families, the Mendozas. He was small of stature and suffered from hunchbackedness. Besides, his red haired complexion made him an occasional object of scorn, since some sectors of the conservative catholic society in which he later lived held the prejudice that Judas Iscariot was a redhead. Because of this, his critics often ridiculed his appearance rather than his works.

He went to Spain in 1600, where he studied law at the University of Salamanca. He continued his studies towards a Licentiate in Law—roughly equivalent to a modern master&#x27;s degree—which he finished in 1605, without, however, taking the degree. Instead, he practiced law for a while in Seville, then in 1608 went back to Mexico, and in 1609 received the licentiate from the University of Mexico. He completed his studies for his doctorate fairly soon thereafter, but never received the degree, in all likelihood because of the rather substantial costs attached to the ceremony. He worked as a legal adviser for a while, as an advocate, and as an interim investigating judge, all the while trying repeatedly and unsuccessfully to gain a teaching chair at the University.

Returning to Spain about 1611, he entered the household of the marquis de Salinas, and began a frustrating life of job-seeking at court. At the same time, purely as a way of making money apparently, he threw himself into the heady literary and theatrical life of the capital, eventually having a number of his plays performed. His first play, &quot;El semejante de sí mismo&quot; was unsuccessful, yet it attracted attention to him. By some, he was ridiculed and criticized; from others he obtained support.

For ten years, he pursued this double life, until he finally secured first an interim and then a permanent appointment to the Royal Council of the Indies (1626) — rather like an appeals court for Spanish colonies in America. Apparently, when political success came, he all but stopped his literary efforts—although he did have two volumes of his plays published (in 1628 and 1634), perhaps because some of them had been pirated and previously published with false attributions to his theatrical rival Félix Lope de Vega. After thirteen years of legal service to the crown, he died at Madrid in 1639.

==Literary career and importance==
Alarcón was the least prolific of all the great dramatists of Spain and is one of the very few Spanish-Americans among the great dramatists of the &quot;Siglo de Oro&quot;. He wrote less than did others, and many of his works circulated under their names. He took pains to mull over his plays and polish both their versification and their general composition. Fitzmaurice-Kelly said of Alarcón: &quot;There are Spanish dramatists greater than Ruiz de Alarcón: there is none whose work is of such even excellence.&quot;

He is the author of approximately twenty-five plays. Twenty of them were published by the playwright in two volumes. The first, from 1628, contains eight plays (&quot;Los favores del mundo&quot;, &quot;La industria y la suerte&quot;, &quot;Las paredes oyen&quot;, &quot;El semejante a sí mismo&quot;, &quot;La cueva de Salamanca&quot;, &quot;Mudarse por mejorarse&quot;, &quot;Todo es ventura&quot; and &quot;El desdichado en fingir&quot;); and the second volume from 1634 consists of twelve plays (&quot;Los empeños de un engaño&quot;, &quot;El dueño de las estrellas&quot;, &quot;La amistad castigada&quot;, &quot;La manganilla de Melilla&quot;, &quot;Ganar amigos&quot;, &quot;La verdad sospechosa&quot;, &quot;El anticristo&quot;, &quot;El tejedor de Segovia&quot;, &quot;La prueba de las promesas&quot;, &quot;Los pechos privilegiados&quot;, &quot;La crueldad por el honor&quot; and &quot;El examen de maridos&quot;). Other plays were published in collections. These include: &quot;Quien mal anda mal acaba&quot;, &quot;No hay mal que por bien no venga&quot; and &quot;La culpa busca la pena, y el agravio la venganza&quot;. He is also the author of a play written in collaboration, &quot;Algunas hazañas de las muchas de don García Hurtado de Mendoza&quot; (1622).

The most famous of his plays is &quot;La verdad sospechosa&quot;, (published in 1634). The first great French comedy in modern French literature, Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Le menteur&quot; (&quot;The Liar&quot;), was confessedly modeled after it. &quot;Las paredes oyen&quot; (&quot;Walls have Ears&quot;) is often seen as a companion-piece since both plays deal with mendacity. His plays can be divided into at least three distinct categories: social comedies, political dramas and plays that dramatize astrology, magic and other occult practices. Among the political plays, &quot;El dueño de las estrellas&quot; stands out as a stunning tragedy, dealing with Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver. Although the oracle had predicted that he would either kill a king or be killed by one, when faced with the dilemma he commits suicide thus overcoming the power of the stars. A second political play, &quot;La amistad castigada&quot;, is unusual because the king is deposed at the end. The magic plays include astonishing instances of the occult at a time when such practices were frowned upon. See, for example, &quot;La cueva de Salamanca&quot; and &quot;La prueba de las promesas&quot;. &quot;Quien mal anda, mal acaba&quot; may be the first Spanish play that dramatizes a pact with the devil. Indeed, even in social comedies such as &quot;Las paredes oyen&quot; we can encounter extensive astrological allusions.

Embittered by his deformity, Alarcón was constantly engaged in personal quarrels with his rivals; but his attitude in these polemics is always dignified, and his crushing retort to Lope de Vega in &quot;Los pechos privilegiados&quot; is an unsurpassed example of cold, scornful invective.

More than any other Spanish dramatist, Alarcón was preoccupied with ethical aims, and his gift of dramatic presentation is as brilliant as his dialogue is natural and vivacious. It has been alleged that his non-Spanish origin is noticeable in his plays, and there is some foundation for the observation; but his workmanship is exceptionally conscientious, and in &quot;El Tejedor de Segovia&quot; he produced a masterpiece of national art, national sentiment and national expression.

<text>Galls (from the Latin , &#x27;oak-apple&#x27;) or cecidia (from the Greek , anything gushing out) are a kind of swelling growth on the external tissues of plants. Plant galls are abnormal outgrowths of plant tissues, similar to benign tumors or warts in animals. They can be caused by various parasites, from viruses, fungi and bacteria, to other plants, insects and mites. Plant galls are often highly organized structures so that the cause of the gall can often be determined without the actual agent being identified. This applies particularly to insect and mite plant galls. The study of plant galls is known as cecidology.

== Anatomy ==

=== Shape and size ===

Galls develop on various plant organs, providing nutrition and shelter to inducing insects. Galls display vast variation in morphology, size, and wall composition. The size of insect galls can range significantly, from approximately two inches in diameter to less than one-sixteenth of an inch. Some galls are so small that they are merely slightly thickened patches on leaves. Their shape can range from spherical to bursiform, bullet-shaped, flower-shaped, cylindrical, or diamond-like. Factors influencing gall morphology include plant species, tissue type, gall-inducing agent, and environmental conditions. They typically exhibit symmetrical forms, although their end shapes vary due to differences in the physical actions and chemical stimuli of different insects. Around 90% of galls occur on the leaves of dicotyledons. Galls can develop on various parts of the host plant, such as roots, leaf bases, branches, or leaflets. Internally, galls also exhibit diverse structures. Some are simple, comprising only outgrown and curved leaf tissues, while others feature complex, hierarchical arrangements with multiple chambers containing different types of tissues, including collenchyma, parenchyma, physalides-parenchyma, and a nutritive cellular layer.

=== Structure ===

In a general gall wasp gall, the outermost layer is the epidermis followed by outer cortex and then inner cortex. In some galls these two cortex layers are separated by a lignified layer. The innermost part of a gall is the larval chamber. The nutritive layer is situated between the larval chamber and the inner cortex. There is a nutritional gradient (high to low) from inside to outside of the gall while defense gradient to the opposite direction.

=== Morphogenesis ===

Gall morphogenesis involves the regulation of the organ on which the gall occurs while maintaining differentiation freedom. Gall development begins from a single or group of metaplasied cells and progresses through promoter-mediated cell expansion, cell multiplication, programmed differentiation, and control of symmetry.

Plant response involves the establishment of metaplasied cells and localized metabolic changes to repair the wound and neutralize stress. Osmotic stress leads to the development of metaplasied cells, characterized by increased quantities of osmotically active material. The rejection response by the plant triggers the synthesis of defense compounds and enzymes.

=== Differentiation ===

* Development of novel cell types: Galls exhibit unique cell types such as abnormally thick-walled dead cells (e.g., xylary elements and sclereids) and thin-walled living cells. These cells differentiate in specific patterns, contributing to the structure of the gall.
* Nutritive tissue: Most galls contain specialized nutritive tissue that provides nutrition to the inducing arthropod and sometimes to their progeny. The structure of this tissue varies depending on the insect species inducing the gall and their feeding behaviors. Nutritive tissue differentiation is influenced by the length and nature of the insect&#x27;s mouthparts.
* Characteristics of nutritive cells: Nutritive cells exhibit dynamic features such as enriched cytoplasm, fragmented vacuoles, hypertrophied nucleus and nucleolus, and abundant cell organelles. They contain elevated levels of carbohydrates, lipids, soluble sugars, and proteins, along with intense phosphatase activity.
* Changes in nutritive tissue: The activity of the nutritive tissue is maintained as long as the inhabiting larva continues to feed. However, when feeding ceases, the dynamic profile of the tissue gradually diminishes, and it is eventually replaced by inactive parenchyma. Removal or death of the larva leads to rapid changes in the distribution of carbohydrates and lipids within the tissue.
* Accumulation of phenolic substances: Cells lining the larval chamber in mature-old galls accumulate phenolic substances, indicating changes in gall tissue composition over time.
* Mineral content: Gall tissues contain elevated levels of various minerals, which may play a role in gall development and function.

=== Types ===

There are two primary categories of galls: closed and open. Insects such as wasps, moths, and flies, possessing chewing mouthparts during their adult or larval stages, typically inhabit completely enclosed galls. Upon reaching maturity, the adult exits either by chewing its way out or utilizing an opening created by the larval stage. Conversely, insects with sucking mouthparts rely on partially open galls or those that naturally open to facilitate emergence. An example of the latter type is the aphid, which forms marble-sized galls on the leaf stems of cottonwood trees. While these galls have thin walls, they harbor entire colonies of aphids within. When the time is right, a slit appears on one side of the gall, allowing the aphids to escape as the slit&#x27;s lips unfold.

== Physiology ==

Insects induce the formation of galls on plants from which they receive various services, such as a source of nutrition and a place to lay eggs, develop, and be provided protection from the environment and enemies. The gall producers are specific to specific plants, thus inducing galls with unique appearances (such as balls, knobs, lumps, and warts) and a range of colors (red, green, yellow, and black). Different taxonomic groups of gall inducers vary in the complexity and diversity of gall formation and organization, with insect induced galls generally being more complex and diverse. Additionally, gall frequency varies based on factors such as weather, plant susceptibility, and pest populations.

=== Gall formation ===

There are four stages of gall development: initiation, growth and differentiation, maturation, and dehiscence. Gall tissues are nutritive and present high concentrations of lipids, proteins, nitrogen, and other nutrients.

The formation of galls which is induction begins with insect saliva on plants. Insect saliva contains various chemicals, induces shock and osmotic changes in the host plant cell. The severity of insect feeding injures the plant varies depending on the insect. The osmotic changes that occur as a result are characterized by increased quantities of osmotically active material and induce the cell metaplasia and gall formation.

Gall growth occurs gradually over time, with the length, breadth, and height of the galls increasing proportionally. The growth rate is maximal during the insect&#x27;s early developmental stages and slows as it approaches adulthood. Plant hormones like auxins play a crucial role in gall growth. The presence of stress and insect secretions stimulates the synthesis of growth-promoting substances, possibly involving a combination of different growth promoters like auxins and kinins. Gall growth involves both cell enlargement and division, but the specific factors triggering cell enlargement remain unclear.

The earliest impact from the insect leads to metaplasia in the affected cells, where they undergo changes in structure and function. When the chemical shock is of high intensity, metaplasia does not occur. Instead, the plant cells local to the shock die, thereby rejecting the insect and defending the plant tissue. Enzymes like invertases are involved in gall growth, with greater activity correlating with stronger gall development. Gall-inducing insect performance is influenced by plant vigor and module size, with larger, fast-growing plant modules resulting in larger galls. Conversely, galls are easily induced on smaller plant modules.

== Genetics ==

Galls are unique growths on plants, and how the plant&#x27;s genetic instructions could produce these structures in response to external factors is still a fresh field of science. Genetic mechanisms of gall formation is a unique interplay between the parasite and the host plant in shaping the developmental trajectory of the gall organ.

The &#x27;zigzag&#x27; model introduced by Jones &amp; Dangl (2006) demonstrates the molecular interactions underlying gall induction. This model, refined over time and subject to ongoing enhancements, illustrates the intricate dynamics between antagonistic molecular players. Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), constitutes the initial defense layer of plant cells, activated upon detection of &quot;danger signals.&quot; These signals, termed damage-associated-molecular-patterns (DAMPs) if originating from the plant or microbe/pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns (MAMPs, PAMPs, or HAMPs) if from the parasite, engage pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) triggering signaling cascades. PRRs, classified as receptor-like kinases (RLKs), mediate intercellular communication by bridging external stimuli with intracellular defense mechanisms. Antagonists, employing effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS) manipulate host-cell functions through effector molecules encoded by effector genes, aiming primarily at suppressing plant defenses. Some effectors exploit plant traits, known as &quot;plant susceptibility traits,&quot; diverting the plant&#x27;s resources in favor of the parasite. Effectoromics, involving high-throughput expression screens, aids in identifying effector candidates crucial for colonization. Conversely, Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) responsible for plant&#x27;s counterattack, leveraging effectors as &quot;danger signals&quot; to render the parasite avirulent. During ETI, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing receptors detect perturbations induced by effectors, leading to downstream signaling events that promote defense responses. However, parasites can counteract ETI by modifying ETS, undermining the efficacy of resistance genes deployed in agriculture. The evolutionary arms race between plants and parasites, underscored by the expansion of gene families involved in biotic interactions, shapes their genomic landscape, influencing their adaptive strategies and diversification.

Crown galls formed under the influence of the bacterium &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; exhibit several distinctive characteristics when compared to other types of galls. This bacterium transfers genetic material known as T-DNA into the plant cells, where it becomes integrated into the chromosomes. The T-DNA contains genes that encode for production of auxin, cytokinin and opines. As a result, the infected plant cells undergo rapid multiplication, essentially transforming into &quot;bacterial factories&quot; that produce more bacterial bodies.

Certain bacteria, like &quot;Rhodococcus fascians&quot;, induce the formation of leafy galls on plants, affecting their growth. These galls act as permanent sinks, diverting nutrients away from other parts of the plant and causing growth suppression elsewhere. The bacteria possess virulence genes that control their ability to colonize plants and produce cytokinins, which influence plant growth. While parasitic gall-inducers are typically harmful to plants, researchers are exploring ways to harness their growth-promoting abilities for agricultural benefit. Some derivatives of &quot;R. fascians&quot; are being investigated for their potential to promote balanced plant growth, and scientists are also studying plant interactions with these bacteria to discover traits that could enhance crop yields.

Most of the transcriptomic studies on plant galls used entire gall samples resulting both gall and non-gall cells leading to thousands of gene expressions during gall development. Recent studies on gall induced by gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) &quot;Dryocosmus quercuspalustris&quot; on northern red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra L.&quot;) leaves demonstrate the complexity of genetic mechanisms underlying galls by quantifying the tissue-specific gene expression. There are substantial differences in gene expression between inner and outer gall tissues compared to adjacent leaf tissues. Approximately 28% of oak genes display differential expression in the gall compared to leaves, indicating significant transcriptional changes associated with gall development. According to the transcriptome analysis, while the outer gall transcriptome resembles that of twigs, leaf buds, and reproductive structures, the inner gall transcriptome is distinct from normal oak tissues, underscoring the complexity of gall formation. Furthermore, there is an upregulation of genes related to sugar and amino acid metabolism in both outer and inner gall tissues, suggesting a role in transporting plant metabolites to support the nutritional needs of the developing gall wasp larva. The defense-related genes are found to be suppressed in inner gall tissues as a strategy to accommodate the feeding activity of the parasite.

== Taxonomic range ==

Plant galls are caused by a wide range of organisms, including animals such as insects, mites, and nematodes; fungi; bacteria; viruses; and other plants.

=== Insects ===

Insect galls are the highly distinctive plant structures formed by some herbivorous insects as their own microhabitats. They are plant tissue which is controlled by the insect. Galls act as both the habitat and food source for the maker of the gall. The interior of a gall can contain edible nutritious starch and other tissues. Some galls act as &quot;physiologic sinks&quot;, concentrating resources in the gall from the surrounding plant parts. Galls may also provide the insect with physical protection from predators.

Insect galls are usually induced by chemicals injected by the larvae of the insects into the plants and possibly mechanical damage. After the galls are formed, the larvae develop inside until fully grown, when they leave. To form galls, the insects must take advantage of the time when plant cell division occurs quickly: the growing season, usually spring in temperate climates, but which is extended in the tropics.

The meristems, where plant cell division occurs, are the usual sites of galls, though insect galls can be found on other parts of the plant, such as the leaves, stalks, branches, buds, roots, and even flowers and fruits. Gall-inducing insects are usually species-specific and sometimes tissue-specific on the plants they gall.

Gall-inducing insects include gall wasps, gall midges, gall flies, leaf-miner flies, aphids, scale insects, psyllids, thrips, gall moths, and weevils.

Many gall insects remain to be described. Estimates range up to more than 210,000 species, not counting parasitoids of gall-forming insects.

==== Cynipid wasps ====

More than 1400 species of cynipid wasps cause galls. Some 1000 of these are in the tribe Cynipini, their hosts mostly being oak trees and other members of the Fagaceae (the beech tree family). These are often restricted taxonomically to a single host species or a group of related species.

==== Non-cynipid wasps ====

Some wasps from other groups, such as the Diplolepididae and the Chalcidoidea, also cause plant galls.

==== Hemipteran bugs ====

Among the hemipteran bugs that cause galls are the psyllid bug &quot;Pachypsylla celtidisumbilicus&quot;, and the woolly aphid &quot;Adelges abietis&quot;, which parasitises coniferous trees such as the Sitka spruce and the Norway spruce.

==== Dipteran flies ====

Some dipteran flies such as the cecidomyiid gall midges &quot;Dasineura investita&quot; and &quot;Neolasioptera boehmeriae&quot;, and some Agromyzidae leaf-miner flies cause galls.

=== Mites ===

Mites in the family Eriophyidae often cause galls to form on their hosts. The family contains more than 3,000 described species which attack a wide variety of plants.

=== Nematodes ===

Nematodes are microscopic worms that live in soil. Some nematodes (&quot;Meloidogyne&quot; species or root-knot nematodes) cause galls on the roots of susceptible plants. The galls are often small.

=== Fungi ===

Many rust fungi induce gall formation, including western gall rust, which infects a variety of pine trees and cedar-apple rust. Galls are often seen in &quot;Millettia pinnata&quot; leaves and fruits. Leaf galls appear like tiny clubs; however, flower galls are globose. &quot;Exobasidium&quot; often induces spectacular galls on its hosts.

The fungus &quot;Ustilago esculenta&quot; associated with &quot;Zizania latifolia&quot;, a wild rice, produces an edible gall highly valued as a food source in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces of China.

=== Bacteria and viruses ===

Gall-causing bacteria include &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas savastanoi&quot;.

Gall forming virus was found on rice plants in central Thailand in 1979 and named rice gall dwarf. Symptoms consisted of gall formation along leaf blades and sheaths, dark green discoloration, twisted leaf tips, and reduced numbers of tillers. Some plants died in the glasshouse in the later stages of infection. The causal agent was transmitted by the hemipteran bug &quot;Nephotettix nigropictus&quot; after an incubation of two weeks. Polyhedral particles of 65 nm diameter in the cytoplasm of phloem cells were always associated with the disease. No serologic relationship was found between this virus and that of rice dwarf.

=== Plants ===

The hemiparasitic plant mistletoe forms woody structures sometimes called galls on its hosts. More complex interactions are possible; the parasitic plant &quot;Cassytha filiformis&quot; sometimes preferentially feeds on galls induced by the cynipid wasp &quot;Belonocnema treatae&quot;.

== Physiology of insect-induced galls ==

Insects induce the formation of galls on plants from which they receive various services, such as a source of nutrition and a place to lay eggs, develop, and be provided protection from the environment and enemies. The gall producers are specific to specific plants, thus inducing galls with unique appearances (balls, knobs, lumps, warts, etc.) and a range of colors (red, green, yellow, and black). Different taxonomic groups of gall inducers vary in the complexity and diversity of gall formation and organization, with insect induced galls generally being more complex and diverse. Additionally, gall frequency varies based on factors such as weather, plant susceptibility, and pest populations.

There are four stages of gall development: initiation, growth and differentiation, maturation, and dehiscence. Gall tissues are nutritive and present high concentrations of lipids, proteins, nitrogen, and other nutrients. The formation of galls begins with insect saliva on plants inducing a chemical shock. The osmotic changes that occur as a result are characterized by increased quantities of osmotically active material and induce the cell metaplasia and gall formation. When the chemical shock is of high intensity, metaplasia does not occur. Instead, the plant cells local to the shock die, thereby rejecting the insect and defending the plant tissue.

== Uses ==

Galls are rich in resins and tannic acid and have been used widely in the manufacturing of permanent inks (such as iron gall ink) and astringent ointments, in dyeing, and in leather tanning. The Talmud records using gallnuts as part of the tanning process as well as a dye-base for ink.

Medieval Arabic literature records many uses for the gall, called in Arabic. The Aleppo gall, found on oak trees in northern Syria, was among the most important exports from Syria during this period, with one merchant recording a shipment of galls from Suwaydiyya near Antioch fetching the high price of 4½ dinars per 100 pounds. The primary use of the galls was as a mordant for black dyes; they were also used to make a high-quality ink. The gall was also used as a medication to treat fever and intestinal ailments.

<text>Mites are small arachnids (eight-legged arthropods). Mites span two large orders of arachnids, the Acariformes and the Parasitiformes, which were historically grouped together in the subclass Acari. However, most recent genetic analyses do not recover the two as each other&#x27;s closest relative within Arachnida, rendering the group non-monophyletic. Most mites are tiny, less than in length, and have a simple, unsegmented body plan. The small size of most species makes them easily overlooked; some species live in water, many live in soil as decomposers, others live on plants, sometimes creating galls, while others are predators or parasites. This last type includes the commercially destructive &quot;Varroa&quot; parasite of honey bees, as well as scabies mites of humans. Most species are harmless to humans, but a few are associated with allergies or may transmit diseases.

The scientific discipline devoted to the study of mites is called acarology.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
The mites are not a defined taxon, but is used for two distinct groups of arachnids, the Acariformes and the Parasitiformes. The phylogeny of the Acari has been relatively little studied, but molecular information from ribosomal DNA is being extensively used to understand relationships between groups. The 18 S rRNA gene provides information on relationships among phyla and superphyla, while the ITS2, and the 18S ribosomal RNA and 28S ribosomal RNA genes, provide clues at deeper levels.

===Taxonomy===
* Superorder Parasitiformes – ticks and a variety of mites
** Opilioacarida – a small order of large mites that superficially resemble harvestmen (Opiliones), hence their name
** Holothyrida - small group of predatory mites native to former Gondwana landmasses
** Ixodida – ticks
** Mesostigmata – a large order of predatory and parasitic mites
*** Trigynaspida - large, diverse order
*** Monogynaspida - diverse order of parasitic and predatory mites
*** Sejida - small order of mites containing five families
* Superorder Acariformes – the most diverse group of mites
** Endeostigmata (probably paraphyletic)
** Eriophyoidea – gall mites and relatives
** Trombidiformes – plant parasitic mites (spider mites, peacock mites, red-legged earth mites, etc.), snout mites, chiggers, hair follicle mites, velvet mites, water mites, etc.
*** Sphaerolichida - small order of mites containing two families
*** Prostigmata - large order of sucking mites
** Sarcoptiformes
*** Oribatida – oribatid mites, beetle mites, armored mites (formerly known as Cryptostigmata)
*** Astigmatina – stored product, fur, feather, dust, and human itch mites, etc.

===Fossil record===
The mite fossil record is sparse, due to their small size and low preservation potential. The oldest fossils of acariform mites are from the Rhynie Chert, Scotland, which dates to the early Devonian, around 410 million years ago while the earliest fossils of Parasitiformes are known from amber specimens dating to the mid-Cretaceous, around 100 million years ago. Most fossil acarids are no older than the Tertiary (up to 65 mya).

===Phylogeny===

Members of the superorders Opilioacariformes and Acariformes (sometimes known as Actinotrichida) are mites, as well as some of the Parasitiformes (sometimes known as Anactinotrichida). Recent genetic research has suggested that Acari is polyphyletic (of multiple origins). A study using molecular data from the mitochondria and nucleus recovered Acariformes as sister to the Solifugae (camel spiders) and Parasitiformes as sister to the Pseudoscorpionida, with other arachnid orders separating these two groupings on the phylogenetic tree, as shown below.

However, a few phylogenomic studies have found strong support for monophyly of Acari and a sister relationship between Acariformes and Parasitiformes, although this finding has been questioned, with other studies suggesting that this likely represents a long branch attraction artefact.

==Anatomy==

===External===
Mites are tiny members of the class Arachnida; most are in the size range but some are larger and some are no bigger than as adults. The body plan has two regions, a cephalothorax (with no separate head) or prosoma, and an opisthosoma or abdomen. Segmentation has almost entirely been lost and the prosoma and opisthosoma are fused, only the positioning of the limbs indicating the location of the segments.

At the front of the body is the gnathosoma or capitulum. This is not a head and does not contain the eyes or the brain, but is a retractable feeding apparatus consisting of the chelicerae, the pedipalps and the oral cavity. It is covered above by an extension of the body carapace and is connected to the body by a flexible section of cuticle. 
Two-segmented chelicerae is the ancestral condition in Acariformes, but in more derived groups they are single-segmented. And three-segmented chelicerae is the ancestral condition in Parasitiformes, but has been reduced to just two segments in more derived groups. The pedipalps differ between taxa depending on diet; in some species the appendages resemble legs while in others they are modified into chelicerae-like structures. The oral cavity connects posteriorly to the mouth and pharynx.

Most mites have four pairs of legs (two pairs in Eriophyoidea), each with six segments, which may be modified for swimming or other purposes. The dorsal surface of the body is clad in hardened tergites and the ventral surface by hardened sclerites; sometimes these form transverse ridges. The gonopore (genital opening) is located on the ventral surface between the fourth pair of legs. Some species have one to five median or lateral eyes but many species are blind, and slit and pit sense organs are common. Both body and limbs bear setae (bristles) which may be simple, flattened, club-shaped or sensory. Mites are usually some shade of brown, but some species are red, orange, black or green, or some combination of these colours.

Many mites have stigmata (openings used in respiration). In some mites, the stigmata are associated with peritremes: paired, tubular, elaborated extensions of the tracheal system. The higher taxa of mites are defined by these structures:

* Oribatida, formerly known as Cryptostigmata ( = hidden), and Endeostigmata (endeo- = internal) lack primary stigmata and peritremes but may have secondary respiratory systems. For example, oribatids in the suborder Brachypylina have stigmata on the ventral plate of the body that are difficult to see (thus the former name Cryptostigmata).
* Astigmata ( = without) lack stigmata and respire through their cuticle.
* Prostigmata ( = before/in front) have stigmata at the front of the body, usually on the lateral margins or between the chelicerae. These are associated with peritremes that may be on the prodorsum near the cheliceral bases, or be horn-like and emergent, or form a line or network on the dorsum of the gnathosomal capsule.
* Opilioacaridae have four pairs of dorsolateral stigmata that are added sequentially during development.
* The other three orders of Parasitiformes, Holothyrida, Ixodida, and Mesostigmata ( = middle), have just one pair of stigmata in the region of the fourth pair of legs. They also have peritremes: in Ixodida these consist of paired encircling plates around the stigmata, while the peritremes in Mesostigmata and Holothyrida are grooves extending from the stigmata anteriorly (sometimes also posteriorly).

===Internal===
Mite digestive systems have salivary glands that open into the preoral space rather than the foregut. Most species carry two to six pairs of salivary glands that empty at various points into the subcheliceral space. A few mite species lack an anus: they do not defecate during their short lives. The circulatory system consists of a network of sinuses and most mites lacks a heart, movement of fluid being driven by the contraction of body muscles. But ticks, and some of the larger species of mites, have a dorsal, longitudinal heart. Gas exchange is carried out across the body surface, but many species additionally have between one and four pairs of tracheae. The excretory system includes a nephridium and one or two pairs of Malpighian tubules. Several families of mites, such as Tetranychidae, Eriophyidae, Camerobiidae, Cunaxidae, Trombidiidae, Trombiculidae, Erythraeidae and Bdellidae have silk glands used to produce silk for various purposes. Additionally, water mites (Hydrachnidia) produce long thin threads that may be silk.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
The sexes are separate in mites; males have a pair of testes in the mid-region of the body, each connected to the gonopore by a vas deferens, and in some species there is a chitinous penis; females have a single ovary connected to the gonopore by an oviduct, as well as a seminal receptacle for the storage of sperm. In most mites, sperm is transferred to the female indirectly; the male either deposits a spermatophore on a surface from which it is picked up by the female, or he uses his chelicerae or third pair of legs to insert it into the female&#x27;s gonopore. In some of the Acariformes, insemination is direct using the male&#x27;s penis. The spermatophora in all mites are aflagellate.

The eggs are laid in the substrate, or wherever the mite happens to live. They take up to six weeks to hatch, according to species, with the next stage being the six-legged larvae. After three moults, the larvae become nymphs, with eight legs, and after a further three moults, they become adults. Longevity varies between species, but the lifespan of mites is short compared to many other arachnids.

==Ecology==

===Niches===
Mites occupy a wide range of ecological niches. For example, Oribatida mites are important decomposers in many habitats. They eat a wide variety of material including living and dead plant and fungal material, lichens and carrion; some are predatory, though no oribatid mites are parasitic. Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all invertebrate groups. They have exploited a wide array of habitats, and because of their small size go largely unnoticed. They are found in freshwater (e.g. the water mites or Hydrachnidia) and saltwater (most Halacaridae), in the soil, in forests, pastures, agricultural crops, ornamental plants, thermal springs and caves. They inhabit organic debris of all kinds and are extremely numerous in leaf litter. They feed on animals, plants and fungi and some are parasites of plants and animals. Some 48,200 species of mites have been described, but there may be a million or more species as yet undescribed. The tropical species &quot;Archegozetes longisetosus&quot; is one of the strongest animals in the world, relative to its mass (100 μg): It lifts up to 1,182 times its own weight, over five times more than would be expected of such a minute animal. A mite also holds a speed record: for its length, &quot;Paratarsotomus macropalpis&quot; is the fastest animal on Earth.

The mites living in soil consist of a range of taxa. Oribatida and Prostigmata are more numerous in soil than Mesostigmata, and have more soil-dwelling species. When soil is affected by an ecological disturbance such as agriculture, most mites (Astigmata, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata) recolonise it within a few months, whereas Oribatida take multiple years.

===Parasitism===

Many mites are parasitic on plants and animals. One family of mites, Pyroglyphidae, or nest mites, live primarily in the nests of birds and other animals. These mites are largely parasitic and consume blood, skin and keratin. Dust mites, which feed mostly on dead skin and hair shed from humans instead of consuming them from the organism directly, evolved from these parasitic ancestors. Ticks are a prominent group of mites that are parasitic on vertebrates, mostly mammal and birds, feeding on blood with specialised mouthparts.

Parasitic mites sometimes infest insects. &quot;Varroa destructor&quot; attaches to the body of honey bees, and &quot;Acarapis woodi&quot; (family Tarsonemidae) lives in their tracheae. Hundreds of species are associated with other bees, mostly poorly described. They attach to bees in a variety of ways. For example, &quot;Trigona corvina&quot; workers have been found with mites attached to the outer face of their hind tibiae. Some are thought to be parasites, while others are beneficial symbionts. Mites also parasitize some ant species, such as &quot;Eciton burchellii&quot;. Most larvae of Parasitengona are ectoparasites of arthropods, while later life stages in this group tend to shift to being predators.

Plant pests include the so-called spider mites (family Tetranychidae), thread-footed mites (family Tarsonemidae), and the gall mites (family Eriophyidae). Among the species that attack animals are members of the sarcoptic mange mites (family Sarcoptidae), which burrow under the skin. Demodex mites (family Demodecidae) are parasites that live in or near the hair follicles of mammals, including humans.

===Dispersal===
Being unable to fly, mites need some other means of dispersal. On a small scale, walking is used to access other suitable locations in the immediate vicinity. Some species mount to a high point and adopt a dispersal posture and get carried away by the wind, while others waft a thread of silk aloft to balloon to a new position.

Parasitic mites use their hosts to disperse, and spread from host to host by direct contact. Another strategy is phoresy; the mite, often equipped with suitable claspers or suckers, grips onto an insect or other animal, and gets transported to another place. A phoretic mite is just a hitch-hiker and does not feed during the time it is carried by its temporary host. These travelling mites are mostly species that reproduce rapidly and are quick to colonise new habitats.

==Relationship with humans==
Mites are tiny and apart from those that are of economic concern to humans, little studied. The majority are beneficial, living in the soil or aqueous environments and assisting in the decomposition of decaying organic material, as part of the carbon cycle.

Two species live on humans, namely &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; and &quot;Demodex brevis&quot;; both are frequently referred to as eyelash mites.

===Medical significance===
The majority of mite species are harmless to humans and domestic animals, but a few species can colonize mammals directly, acting as vectors for disease transmission, and causing or contributing to allergenic diseases. Mites which colonize human skin are the cause of several types of itchy skin rashes, such as gamasoidosis, rodent mite dermatitis, grain itch, grocer&#x27;s itch, and scabies; &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot; is a parasitic mite responsible for scabies, which is one of the three most common skin disorders in children. &quot;Demodex&quot; mites, which are common cause of mange in dogs and other domesticated animals, have also been implicated in the human skin disease rosacea, although the mechanism by which &quot;demodex&quot; contributes to the disease is unclear. Ticks are well known for carrying diseases, such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Chiggers are known primarily for their itchy bite, but they can also spread disease in some limited circumstances, such as scrub typhus. The house-mouse mite is the only known vector of the disease rickettsialpox. House dust mites, found in warm and humid places such as beds, cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and are known to aggravate atopic dermatitis.

Among domestic animals, sheep are affected by the mite &quot;Psoroptes ovis&quot; which lives on the skin, causing hypersensitivity and inflammation. Hay mites are a suspected reservoir for scrapie, a prion disease of sheep.

===In beekeeping===

The mite &quot;Varroa destructor&quot; is a serious pest of honey bees, contributing to colony collapse disorder in commercial hives. This organism is an obligate external parasite, able to reproduce only in bee colonies. It directly weakens its host by sucking up the bee&#x27;s fat, and can spread RNA viruses including deformed wing virus. Heavy infestation causes the death of a colony, generally over the winter. Since 2006, more than 10 million beehives have been lost.

=== Biological pest control ===
Various mites prey on other invertebrates and can be used to control their populations. Phytoseiidae, especially members of &quot;Amblyseius&quot;, &quot;Metaseiulus&quot;, and &quot;Phytoseiulus&quot;, are used to control pests such as spider mites. Among the Laelapidae, &quot;Gaeolaelaps aculeifer&quot; and &quot;Stratiolaelaps scimitus&quot; are used to control fungus gnats, poultry red mites and various soil pests.

===In culture===
Mites were first observed under the microscope by the English polymath Robert Hooke. In his 1665 book &quot;Micrographia&quot;, he stated that far from being spontaneously generated from dirt, they were &quot;very prettily shap&#x27;d Insects&quot;. In 1898, Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a satirical poem, &quot;A Parable&quot;, with the conceit of some cheese mites disputing the origin of the round cheddar cheese in which they all lived. The world&#x27;s first science documentary featured cheese mites, seen under the microscope; the short film was shown in London&#x27;s Alhambra music hall in 1903, causing a boom in the sales of simple microscopes.

<text>In computer science, executable code, an executable file, or an executable program, sometimes simply referred to as an executable or binary, causes a computer &quot;to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions&quot;, as opposed to a data file that must be interpreted (parsed) by an interpreter to be functional.

The exact interpretation depends upon the use. &quot;Instructions&quot; is traditionally taken to mean machine code instructions for a physical CPU. In some contexts, a file containing scripting instructions (such as bytecode) may also be considered executable.

==Generation of executable files==
Executable files can be hand-coded in machine language, although it is far more convenient to develop software as source code in a high-level language that can be easily understood by humans. In some cases, source code might be specified in assembly language instead, which remains human-readable while being closely associated with machine code instructions.

The high-level language is compiled into either an executable machine code file or a non-executable machine code – object file of some sort; the equivalent process on assembly language source code is called &quot;assembly&quot;. Several object files are linked to create the executable. Object files—executable or not—are typically stored in a container format, such as Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) or Portable Executable (PE) which is operating system-specific. This gives structure to the generated machine code, for example dividing it into sections such as .text (executable code), .data (initialized global and static variables), and .rodata (read-only data, such as constants and strings).

Executable files typically also include a runtime system, which implements runtime language features (such as task scheduling, exception handling, calling static constructors and destructors, etc.) and interactions with the operating system, notably passing arguments, environment, and returning an exit status, together with other startup and shutdown features such as releasing resources like file handles. For C, this is done by linking in the crt0 object, which contains the actual entry point and does setup and shutdown by calling the runtime library.
Executable files thus normally contain significant additional machine code beyond that directly generated from the specific source code. In some cases, it is desirable to omit this, for example for embedded systems development, or simply to understand how compilation, linking, and loading work. In C, this can be done by omitting the usual runtime, and instead explicitly specifying a linker script, which generates the entry point and handles startup and shutdown, such as calling codice_1 to start and returning exit status to the kernel at the end.

== Execution ==
In order to be executed by the system (such as an operating system, , or boot loader), an executable file must conform to the system&#x27;s application binary interface (ABI). In simple interfaces, a file is executed by loading it into memory and jumping to the start of the address space and executing from there. In more complicated interfaces, executable files have additional metadata specifying a separate entry point. For example, in ELF, the entry point is defined in the header&#x27;s codice_2 field, which specifies the (virtual) memory address at which to start execution. In the GNU Compiler Collection, this field is set by the linker based on the codice_3 symbol.

<doc id="217394" wikidata="Q27333550" url="?curid=217394" title="Lavanify">
<text>Lavanify is a mammalian genus from the late Cretaceous (probably Maastrichtian, about 71 to 66 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species, L. miolaka, is known from two isolated teeth, one of which is damaged. The teeth were collected in 1995–1996 and described in 1997. The animal is classified as a member of Gondwanatheria, an enigmatic extinct group with unclear phylogenetic relationships, and within Gondwanatheria as a member of the family Sudamericidae. &quot;Lavanify&quot; is most closely related to the Indian &quot;Bharattherium&quot;; the South American &quot;Sudamerica&quot; and &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; are more distantly related. Gondwanatheres probably ate hard plant material.

&quot;Lavanify&quot; had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the two teeth is 11.2 mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is centered laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8 mm high and has at least one deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of &quot;Lavanify&quot; and &quot;Bharattherium&quot; include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.

==Discovery and context==
Two teeth of &quot;Lavanify&quot; were discovered in 1995–1996 during joint expeditions of the State University of New York, Stony Brook University, and the University of Antananarivo to the late Cretaceous (mostly Maastrichtian, about 71 to 66 million years ago [mya]) Maevarano Formation of northwestern Madagascar. The two teeth were found in different sites in a white sandstone unit of the Maevarano Formation near the village of Berivotra and have been deposited in the collections of the University of Antananarivo (specimen UA 8653) and Field Museum of Natural History (specimen FMNH PM 59520). David W. Krause and colleagues described &quot;Lavanify&quot; and a sudamericid from India, which they did not name, in a 1997 paper in &quot;Nature&quot;. These were the first gondwanathere mammals to be found outside of Argentina and provided evidence that the mammal faunas of the different Gondwanan (southern) continents were similar to each other. The generic name, &quot;Lavanify&quot;, means &quot;long tooth&quot; and the specific name, &quot;miolaka&quot;, means &quot;curved&quot; in Malagasy; both refer to the teeth&#x27;s shape.

Gondwanatheres are a small group of mammals of uncertain phylogenetic affinities known from the late Cretaceous to the Eocene (~56–34 mya) of the Gondwanan continents, known only from teeth and a few lower jaws. Upon their discovery in the 1980s, gondwanatheres were initially thought to be xenarthrans—part of the same group as living sloths, armadillos, and anteaters—but later workers have favored affinities with multituberculates (a diverse group of fossil mammals) or left the relationships of the gondwanatheres open. The group comprises two families. The family Ferugliotheriidae, whose members had low-crowned teeth, occurs in the Campanian (~84–71 mya) to Maastrichtian of Argentina. All other gondwanatheres, including &quot;Lavanify&quot;, are placed in the Sudamericidae, which have high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth. These include &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; from the Campanian and Maastrichtian of Argentina; &quot;Sudamerica&quot; from the Paleocene (~66–56 mya) of Argentina; &quot;Lavanify&quot;; at least one species from the Maastrichtian of India; an unnamed species related to &quot;Sudamerica&quot; from the Eocene of Antarctica; and an unnamed possible gondwanathere, TNM 02067, from the Cretaceous of Tanzania. In 2007, teams led by G.P. Wilson and G.V.R. Prasad independently described this animal as &quot;Dakshina&quot; and &quot;Bharattherium&quot; respectively; as the latter name was published first, it is the correct name for this genus according to the Principle of Priority. Gondwanatheres have been interpreted as feeding on roots, bark, and abrasive vegetation or as the earliest grass-eating mammals.

Several other mammals have been recorded from the late Cretaceous of Madagascar, mostly on the basis of isolated teeth. A possible second gondwanathere is represented by a tooth that is larger and lower-crowned than those of &quot;Lavanify&quot;, and a yet lower-crowned tooth may also be of a gondwanathere. A lower molar, UA 8699, may be of a marsupial or a placental and a molar fragment is referable to Multituberculata. Finally, an as-yet-undescribed mammal is known from a fairly complete skeleton. None of these mammals is related to the living mammals of the island, many of which belong to unique groups (see List of mammals of Madagascar). The fauna also contains crocodyliforms, dinosaurs, and other animals.

==Description==
&quot;Lavanify&quot; is known from the complete cheektooth UA 8653 and the broken tooth FMNH PM 59520. Krause and colleagues could not determine whether the teeth were from the lower or upper jaw and whether they were molars or molariform (molar-like) premolars, but suggested that they represented two different tooth positions. However, Wilson and colleagues in 2007 tentatively identified UA 8653 as a left fourth (last) lower molariform (mf4); because molars and premolars of gondwanatheres cannot be reliably distinguished, the term &quot;molariform&quot; is used instead. FMNH PM 59520 resembles the &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot; fossil MACN Pv-RN 1027, a broken tooth that may be an upper molariform. In both &quot;Lavanify&quot; teeth, the enamel surface features perikymata (ridges and grooves arranged in a transverse, wave-like pattern).

UA 8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2 mm high, of which the crown makes up about 85%, and the dimensions of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2 mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends all the way through the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;. The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).

FMNH PM 59520 is 9.8 mm high. It is similar in many respects to UA 8653, but is less curved and its occlusal surface contains a large (funnel-shaped cavity), filled with cementum and surrounded by enamel that penetrates deeply into the tooth. There is also either a second infundibulum or a cementum-filled furrow. The differences in degree of curvature and occlusal morphology suggest that this tooth represents a different tooth position than UA 8653. Krause and colleagues tentatively placed this tooth in &quot;Lavanify&quot; in view of the considerable variation among other gondwanathere teeth of a single species and in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

==Relationships==

In their original description, Krause and colleagues suggested that &quot;Lavanify&quot; was most closely related to the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of &quot;Dakshina&quot;, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the &quot;Bharattherium-Lavanify&quot; clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of &quot;Lavanify&quot;: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel on one side of the crown. Prasad and colleagues who named &quot;Bharattherium&quot;, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a &quot;Bharattherium&quot; tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of &quot;Bharattherium&quot; and &quot;Lavanify&quot;. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.

<text>Cuxhaven (; ) is a town and seat of the Cuxhaven district, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The town includes the northernmost point of Lower Saxony. It is situated on the shore of the North Sea at the mouth of the Elbe River. Cuxhaven has a footprint of (east–west) by (north–south). Its town quarters Duhnen, Döse and Sahlenburg are especially popular vacation spots on the North Sea and home to about 52,000 residents.

Cuxhaven is home to an important fisherman&#x27;s wharf and ship registration point for Hamburg as well as the Kiel Canal until 2008. Tourism is also of great importance. The city and its precursor Ritzebüttel belonged to Hamburg from the 13th century until 1937. What remains of Ritzebüttel is a castle called &quot;Schloss Ritzebüttel&quot; (Castle Ritzebüttel). The island of Neuwerk, a Hamburg dependency, is located just northwest of Cuxhaven in the North Sea. The city&#x27;s symbol, known as the Kugelbake, is a beacon once used as a lighthouse; the wooden landmark on the mouth of the Elbe marks the boundary between the river and the North Sea and also adorns the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

== History ==
Ritzebüttel, today a part of Cuxhaven, belonged to the Land of Hadeln, first an exclave of the younger Duchy of Saxony and after its de facto dynastic partition in 1296 of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, established &quot;de jure&quot; in 1260. In 1394 the city of Hamburg conquered the fortress of Ritzebüttel and made it its stronghold to protect the estuary of the river Elbe, which connects that city with the open sea.

The Hamburg America Line built a large ocean liner terminal at Cuxhaven in 1900. Connected directly to Hamburg by a dedicated railway line and station, it served as the major departure point for German and European emigrants until 1969 when ocean liner travel ceased. The ornate assembly hall and associated buildings survived wartime damage and peacetime urban renewal to be restored in 1998 for use as a museum and cruise ship terminal.

On 15 March 1907 Cuxhaven gained city status within the state of Hamburg. In 1937 Cuxhaven became an urban district of the Stade Region within the Prussian Province of Hanover by the Greater Hamburg Act. In 1972 some municipalities of the neighboured rural district of &quot;Land of Hadeln&quot; were incorporated into the urban district of Cuxhaven. In 1977 Cuxhaven lost the status as urban district and was integrated into the new rural District of Cuxhaven, being its capital.

During the First World War Nordholz Airbase with its airship hangars, near Nordholz to the south of Cuxhaven, was one of the major Imperial German Navy airship stations. On Christmas Day 1914 it was attacked by Royal Navy seaplanes in the Cuxhaven Raid. It subsequently became a strategically important city as German authorities and civilians feared it would be the site of an Allied invasion.

During the Second World War, the town hosted a base of a Wehrmacht radio network, codenamed BROWN, which transmitted data regarding experimental weapon developments, including rocketry. From this location the last ENIGMA-code encrypted message of the war was transmitted on 7 May 1945. It reported the arrival of British troops and ends: &quot;Closing down for ever – all the best – goodbye.&quot;
Between 1945 and 1964 the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft performed various civilian experiments in rocketry near Cuxhaven.

== Tourism ==


The origins of tourism go back to the year 1816 when a seaside resort was founded in Cuxhaven. Since 1964 Cuxhaven has been a state-recognized climate seaside resort (&quot;Seeheilbad&quot;) and centre of the so-called holiday region of Cuxland.

In the village of &quot;Lüdingworth&quot;, in the southern part of the town, stands the &quot;Jacobikirche, Saint Jack&#x27;s Church&quot;. Due to its organ by Arp Schnitger and its lavish baroque interior, the building is one of the most notable of its kind in all Lower Saxony.

== Geographical and cultural background ==
The town is served by Cuxhaven station.

The island of Neuwerk is situated off the coast from Cuxhaven. At low tide the water recedes so far from the coast that the island can be reached either by mudflat hiking or by horse carriage.

A modern landmark of Cuxhaven is the Friedrich-Clemens-Gerke Tower, a telecommunication tower built of concrete, which is not accessible to the public. It is not really a landmark, for many cities in Germany have a similar tower.

The high-test peroxide (HTP) submarine &quot;U1407&quot; was raised from where she had been scuttled in Cuxhaven after WWII and rebuilt by the British, being commissioned as HMS &quot;Meteorite&quot;. It was the catalyst for a series of German-made air-independent propulsion submarines such as the Type 212 and Type 214.

<doc id="217399" wikidata="Q22348090" url="?curid=217399" title="Sudamerica">
<text>Sudamerica, literally &quot;South America&quot; in Spanish, is a genus of mammal from the extinct suborder Gondwanatheria that lived in Patagonia, Argentina (Salamanca Formation) and Antarctica (La Meseta Formation) from the Middle Paleocene (Peligran), just after the end of the &quot;Age of Dinosaurs&quot;, to the Early Eocene (Casamayoran).

== Etymology ==
The genus and species were named by Scillato-Yané and R. Pascual in 1984. The genus is also known by the synonym &quot;Sudamericana&quot; and the species epithet &quot;ameghinoi&quot; refers to notable Argentinian paleontologist Florentino Ameghino.

== Description ==
Similar to &quot;Gondwanatherium&quot;, this genus had high-crowned teeth, which are very useful for eating grasses. Since there is no evidence of grass in South America until later, they must also have been effective for other types of food.

== Classification ==
The type specimen of &quot;Sudamerica ameghinoi&quot; was discovered in Punta Peligro, Argentina in deposits dating to the Lower Paleocene period. In 1999, a near complete lower jaw (dentary) was found.

The position of gondwanatherians within the class Mammalia is not yet clear.

<doc id="217410" wikidata="Q743836" url="?curid=217410" title="Ney">
<text>The ney (), is an end-blown flute that figures prominently in traditional Persian, Turkish, Jewish, Arab, and Egyptian music. In some of these musical traditions, it is the only wind instrument used. The ney has been played for over 4,500 years, dating back to ancient Egypt, making it one of the oldest musical instruments still in use.

The ney consists of a piece of hollow cane or giant reed with five or six finger holes and one thumb hole. The Arabic ney is played without any mouthpiece. This contrasts with the Turkish ney that sometimes have a brass, horn, or plastic mouthpiece which is placed at the top to protect the wood, to produce a steeper sound, and protect it from damage, with a better edge to blow on. Modern neys may instead be made of metal or plastic tubing. The pitch of the ney varies depending on the region and the finger arrangement. A highly skilled ney player, called &quot;neyzen&quot;, can reach more than three octaves, though it is more common to have several &quot;helper&quot; neys to cover different pitch ranges or to facilitate playing technically difficult passages in other dastgahs or maqams.

In Romanian, this instrument is called &quot;fluier&quot;, the word &quot;nai&quot; is applied to a curved pan flute while an end-blown flute resembling the Persian ney is referred to as caval.

==Typology==

The typical Persian ney has six holes, one of which is on the back. Arabic and Turkish neys normally have seven holes, six in front and one thumb-hole in the back.

The interval between the holes ranges from a semitone to three quarter tones, although microtones (and broader pitch inflections) are achieved via partial hole-covering, changes of embouchure, or positioning and blowing angle. Microtonal inflection is common and crucial to various traditions of taqsim (improvisation in the same scale before a piece is played).

Neys are constructed in various keys. In the Egyptian and Arabic system, there are seven common ranges: the longest and lowest-pitched is the Rast which is roughly equivalent to C in the Western equal temperament system, followed by the Dukah in D, the Busalik in E, the Jaharka in F, the Nawa in G, the Hussayni in A, and the Ajam in B (or B♭), with the Dukah Ney being the most common. 

Advanced players will typically own a set of several neys in various keys, although it is possible (albeit difficult) to play fully chromatically on any instrument. A slight exception to this rule is found in the extreme lowest range of the instrument, where the fingering becomes quite complex and the transition from the first octave (fundamental pitches) to the second is rather awkward.

==Kargı düdük==
Gargy-tuyduk (Karghy tuiduk) is a long reed flute whose origin, according to legend, is connected with Alexander of Macedonia, and a similar instrument existed in ancient Egypt. Kargı in Turkish means reed (&quot;Arundo donax&quot;, also known as Giant reed). The sound of the gargy-tuyduk has much in common with the two-voiced kargyra. During the playing of the gargy-tuyduk the melody is clearly heard, while the lower droning sound is barely audible. 

The allay epic songs have been described by the Turkologist N. Baskakov who divides them into three main types:

*Kutilep kayla: the second sound is a light drone.
*Sygyrtzip kayla: with a second whistling sound like the sound of a flute.
*Kargyrlap kayla: in which the second sound can be defined as hissing. 
The sound of the Turkmen gargy-tuyduk is most like the Altay Kargyrkip kayla. The garg-tuyduk can have six finger holes and a length of 780 mm or five finger holes and a length of 550 mm. The range of the garg-tuyduk includes three registers:
*The lowest register – &quot;non-working&quot; – is not used during the playing of a melody.
*The same as on the &quot;non-working&quot; register but an octave higher.
*High register from mi of the second octave to ti.

==Pamiri nay==
The Pamiri nay is a transverse flute made of wood or, in Eastern Badakhshan, eagle bone. Although the name is similar to the Arabic end-blown nay, it might well be that this side-blown flute is more related to Chinese flutes such as the dizi, perhaps through a Mongol link. 

It is used for solo melodies as well as with orchestras and for vocal accompaniment. One of the main uses of the nay is for the most original form of the traditional performance ‘falaki’. 

These are brief melodic sessions which can express complaints against destiny, the injustice of heaven or exile to distant places, and sentiments such as the sorrow of a mother separated from her daughter, the sorrow of a lover torn from her/his beloved, etc.

==Other forms with similar names ==

The ney (nej) of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Karakalpakstan is a transverse flute that can be made of different materials, often indicated by a prefix in the name. The agach-nai is a wooden flute, the garau-nai a bamboo flute, the misnai a flute made of sheet iron and the brindgzhi-nai a brass flute.

The Romanian pan flute nai consists of at least 20 to over 30 pipes closed at the bottom, which are connected to each other in a slight arc.

==Geography==
The district is located in the mountains of the Sauerland, with the highest elevation in the district of . With , it&#x27;s the largest district in Hessen.

Four artificial lakes created by dams are in the district, the biggest is the Edersee, which covers an area of . The Eder is also the main river in the district; the Diemel in the north is a smaller river.

===Mountains===
*Osterkopf
*Sähre

===Hills===
*Kohlenberg

==Coat of arms==
;Blason
:&quot;“Per bend sinister Azure a lion rampant issuant per fess Argent and Gules and Or a star with eight rays Sable.”&quot;
The coat of arms shows the lion of Hesse in chief. The eight-fold star in base is taken from the coat of arms of the counts and princes of Waldeck, and was also the coat of arms of the former district of Waldeck.

<doc id="217415" wikidata="Q333085" url="?curid=217415" title="David Owen">
<text>David Anthony Llewellyn Owen, Baron Owen, (born 2 July 1938) is a British politician and physician who served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs as a Labour Party MP under James Callaghan from 1977 to 1979, and later led the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He was a Member of Parliament for 26 years, from 1966 to 1992.

Owen served as British Foreign Secretary from 1977 to 1979, at the age of 38 the youngest person in over forty years to hold the post. In 1981, Owen was one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; who left the Labour Party to found the Social Democratic Party. He was the only member of the Gang of Four who did not join the Liberal Democrats, which was founded when the SDP merged with the Liberal Party. Owen led the Social Democratic Party from 1983 to 1987, and the continuing SDP from 1988 to 1990. Appointed as a life peer in 1992, he sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher until March 2014, and sat as an &quot;independent social democrat&quot; until his retirement in 2024.

In the course of his career, Owen has held, and resigned from, a number of senior posts. He first quit as Labour&#x27;s spokesman on defence in 1972 in protest at the Labour leader and former prime minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s attitude to the European Economic Community; he left the Labour Shadow cabinet over the same issue later; and over unilateral disarmament in November 1980 when Michael Foot became Labour leader. He resigned from the Labour Party when it rejected one member, one vote in February 1981 and later as Leader of the Social Democratic Party, which he had helped to found, after the party&#x27;s rank-and-file membership voted to merge with the Liberal Party.

==Early life==
Owen was born in 1938 to Welsh parents in Plympton, near the city of Plymouth, in Devon, England. He also has Swiss and Irish ancestry. He described Plymouth as, &quot;a Cromwellian city, surrounded by royalists.&quot; After schooling at Mount House School, Tavistock, and Bradfield College, Berkshire, he was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1956 to read Medicine, and obtained a lower second; he was made an honorary fellow of the college in 1977. He began clinical training at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in October 1959.

Owen was deeply affected by the Suez crisis of 1956, when Anthony Eden&#x27;s Conservative government launched a military operation to retrieve the Suez Canal after Nasser&#x27;s decision to nationalise it. At the time, aged 18, he was working in a labouring job before going to Cambridge. Owen later told Kenneth Harris:

[T]here was Gaitskell ... criticizing Eden, and here were these men working alongside me, who should have been his natural supporters, furious with him. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; backed Gaitskell, but these men were tearing up their &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;s every day. ... My working mates were solidly in favour of Eden. It was not only that they taught me how people like them think; they also opened my eyes to how I should think myself. From then on I never identified with the liberal – with a small &#x27;l&#x27; – establishment. Through that experience I became suspicious of a kind of automatic sogginess which you come across in many aspects of British life. ... The rather defeatist, even traitorous attitude reflected in the pre-war Apostles at Cambridge. I suppose it underlay the appeasement years. Its modern equivalent is a resigned attitude to Britain&#x27;s continuous post-war economic decline.

==Medicine and politics==
In 1960, Owen joined the Vauxhall branch of the Labour Party and the Fabian Society. He qualified as a doctor in 1962 and began work at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital. In 1964, he contested the Torrington seat as the Labour candidate against the Conservative Party incumbent, losing in what was a traditional Conservative-Liberal marginal. He was neurology and psychiatric registrar at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital for two years, as assistant to Dr William Sargant, then Research Fellow on the Medical Unit doing research into Parkinsonian trauma and neuropharmacology.

==Member of Parliament==
At the next general election in 1966, Owen returned to his home town and was elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the Plymouth Sutton constituency. Aged 27, he was one of the youngest MPs in Parliament. In the February 1974 general election Owen became Labour MP for the adjacent Plymouth Devonport constituency, winning it from the Conservative incumbent Dame Joan Vickers by a slim margin (437 votes). He managed to hold on to it in the 1979 general election, again by a narrow margin (1001 votes). From 1981, however, his involvement with the SDP meant he developed a large personal following in the constituency and thereafter he was re-elected as an SDP candidate with safe margins. He remained as MP for Plymouth Devonport until his elevation to a peerage in 1992.

From 1968 to 1970, Owen served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Navy in Harold Wilson&#x27;s first government. After Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1970 general election, he became the party&#x27;s Junior Defence Spokesman until 1972 when he resigned with Roy Jenkins over Labour&#x27;s opposition to the European Community. On Labour&#x27;s return to government in March 1974, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health before being promoted to Minister of State for Health in July 1974.

==In Government==
As Minister of State for Health, Owen encouraged Britain to become &quot;self-sufficient&quot; in blood products such as Factor VIII, a recommendation also promoted by the World Health Organisation. This was principally due to the risk of Hepatitis infection from high-risk blood donors overseas who were often paid and from &quot;skid-row&quot; locations. David Owen has been outspoken that his policy of &quot;Self-Sufficiency&quot; was not put into place (although he was, himself, Minister of Health) and gave rise to the Tainted Blood Scandal which saw 5,000 British Haemophiliacs infected with Hepatitis C, 1,200 of those were also infected with HIV. It was later described in the House of Lords as &quot;the worst treatment disaster in the history of the National Health Service&quot;.

In September 1976, Owen was appointed by the new prime minister of five months, James Callaghan, as a Minister of State at the Foreign Office, and was consequently admitted to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Five months later, however, the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, died suddenly and Owen was appointed his successor. Aged 38, he became the youngest Foreign Secretary since Anthony Eden in 1935.

In 1977, Owen was condemned by Black civil rights leader Billy Strachan for refusing to prevent the hanging of two Black Bermudians in the British colony. As Foreign Secretary, Owen was identified with the Anglo-American plan for Rhodesia, which formed the basis for the Lancaster House Agreement, negotiated by his Tory successor, Lord Carrington, in December 1979. The Contact Group sponsored UN Resolution 435 in 1978 on which Namibia moved to independence twelve years later. He wrote a book entitled &quot;Human Rights&quot; and championed that cause in Africa and in the Soviet Union. He later admitted to at one stage contemplating the assassination of Idi Amin while Foreign Secretary but settled instead on backing President Nyerere of Tanzania with money for arms purchases for his attack on Uganda which led to the exile of Amin to Saudi Arabia.

Shortly after Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1979 general election and following the election of a new Shadow Cabinet Callaghan moved Owen from the position of Shadow Foreign Secretary to Shadow Energy Secretary, a move which was reported as being a demotion.

Eighteen months after Labour lost power, the staunchly left-wing politician Michael Foot was elected party leader, despite vocal opposition from Labour Party moderates (including Owen), sparking a crisis over the party&#x27;s future.

==Social Democratic Party and Liberal–SDP Alliance==
Michael Foot&#x27;s election as Labour party leader indicated that the party was likely to become more left-wing, and in 1980 committed itself to withdrawing from the EEC without even a referendum (as Labour had carried out in 1975). Labour also endorsed unilateral nuclear disarmament and introduced an electoral college for leadership elections, with 40% of the college going to a block vote of the trade unions.

Early in 1981, Owen and three other senior moderate Labour politicians – Roy Jenkins, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams – announced their intention to break away from the Labour Party to form a &quot;Council for Social Democracy&quot;. The announcement became known as the Limehouse Declaration and the four as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;. The council they formed became the Social Democratic Party (SDP), with a collective leadership. Although Owen was one of the founding members of the party, he was not always enthusiastic about creating a schism on the centre-left, saying to the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; in January 1981 that he felt &quot;haunted by the possibility that, if the Labour Party splits, the centre left will never again form the Government in Britain&quot;.

Twenty-eight other Labour MPs and one Conservative MP (Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler) joined the new party. In late 1981, the SDP formed the SDP–Liberal Alliance with the Liberal Party to strengthen both parties&#x27; chances in the UK&#x27;s &quot;first past the post&quot; electoral system. The alliance performed so well that for much of the early part of 1982, it appeared that it would become a centre-left coalition government at the next election. In 1982, uneasy about the Alliance, Owen challenged Jenkins for the leadership of the SDP, but was defeated by 26,256 votes to 20,864. In the following year&#x27;s general election, the Alliance gained 25% of the vote, only slightly behind the Labour Party, but because of the first-past-the-post voting system, it won only 23 out of 650 seats. Although elected, Jenkins resigned the SDP leadership and Owen succeeded to it without a contest among the six remaining SDP MPs.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, Owen spoke at the Bilderberg meeting advocating sanctions against Argentina. Ironically, the success of the war ended any hope that SDP might have had of winning the 1983 election. The Tories were proving unpopular largely due to high unemployment and the early 1980s recession. However, Britain&#x27;s success in the conflict saw Margaret Thatcher and her Tory government surge back to the top of the opinion polls, and her position was strengthened further by the end of the year as the recession died down.

===SDP leadership===
Owen is widely regarded as having been, at the very least, a competent party leader. He had high popularity ratings throughout his leadership as did the SDP–Liberal Alliance. Owen kept a high profile, so much so that &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, the satirical puppet show, depicted the Liberal leader David Steel popping up like a jack-in-the-box in Owen&#x27;s pocket. He succeeded in keeping the party in the public eye and in maintaining its independence from the Liberals for the length of the 1983 Parliament. Moreover, under him, the SDP increased its representation from six to eight seats via the by-election victories of Mike Hancock, at Portsmouth South (1984), and Rosie Barnes, at Greenwich (1987).

However, the progress of the SDP–Liberal Alliance as a whole was hampered, with policy splits between the two parties. The first was over the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85, with Owen and most of the SDP favouring a fairly tough line but the Liberals preferring compromise and negotiation. More significantly the Alliance had a dispute over the future of Britain&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent. Owen and the SDP favoured replacing Polaris with Trident as a matter of some importance, whereas most Liberals were either indifferent to the issue or committed disarmers. The SDP favoured a radical social market economy, while the Liberals mostly favoured a more interventionist, corporate style approach. The cumulative effect of these divisions was to make the Alliance appear less credible as a potential government in the eyes of the electorate.

Moreover, Owen, unlike Jenkins, faced an increasingly moderate Labour Party under Neil Kinnock and a dynamic Conservative government. The 1987 general election was as disappointing for the Alliance as the 1983 election and it lost one seat. Nevertheless, it won over 23% of the vote – at that time, the second-largest third-placed vote in British politics since 1929.

=== Full parties&#x27; merger ===
In 1987 immediately after the election, the Liberal leader David Steel proposed a full merger of the Liberal and SDP parties and was supported for the SDP by Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers. Owen rejected this notion outright, on the grounds that he and other Social Democrats wished to remain faithful to social democracy as it was practised within Western Europe, and it was unlikely that any merged party would be able to do this, even if it was under his leadership. Nevertheless, the majority of the SDP membership supported the merger.

The Liberal Party and SDP merged to form the Social and Liberal Democrats (SLD) in March 1988, renamed the Liberal Democrats in October 1989.

At the request of two of the remaining SDP MPs, John Cartwright and Rosie Barnes, Owen continued to lead a much smaller continuing SDP, with three MPs in total. The party polled well at its first election, its candidate coming a close second in the 1989 Richmond by-election, but thereafter a string of poor and ultimately disastrous by-election results followed, including coming behind the Official Monster Raving Loony Party in the Bootle by-election of May 1990, prompting Owen to wind up the party in 1990. Owen blamed the SDP&#x27;s demise on the reforms which had been taking place in the Labour Party since Kinnock&#x27;s election as leader in 1983.

Some branches, however, continued to function using the SDP name; Bridlington&#x27;s was still extant in 2006.

Lord Holme later blamed Owen for the Alliance&#x27;s failure to make a breakthrough at the 1987 general election, believing that a merged party would have performed much better and possibly gained more votes and seats than Labour.

==Post-SDP: Political allegiances as a life peer==
After winding up the re-formed SDP, Owen announced his intention to stand down as an MP at the next general election. He then served the remainder of his term as an independent MP and after the 1992 general election was made a life peer, nominated by then Conservative Prime Minister, John Major, with the title, Baron Owen, &quot;of the City of Plymouth in the County of Devon.&quot; in Letters Patent dated 30 June 1992. As a member of the House of Lords, he is called &quot;Lord Owen&quot; and he sat as a crossbencher until 2014 (see below). Owen was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from Plymouth University in 1992.

During the April 1992 election campaign, Owen writing in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; newspaper advised voters to vote Liberal Democrat where they had a chance of victory and to vote Conservative rather than let Neil Kinnock become prime minister. Owen maintained his long-standing position that he would never join the Conservative Party, although the memoirs of at least three of John Major&#x27;s cabinet ministers refer to Major being quite keen to appoint Owen to his cabinet, but threats of resignation from within the Cabinet prevented him from doing so. When asked in a conversation with Woodrow Wyatt on 18 December 1988 whether she would have Owen in her government if approached by him, Margaret Thatcher replied: &quot;Well, not straight away. I don&#x27;t think I would do it straight away. He was very good on the Northern Ireland terrorist business. He&#x27;s wasting his life now. It&#x27;s so tragic. He&#x27;s got real ability and it ought to be used&quot;. In another conversation with Wyatt on 4 June 1990 Thatcher said Owen&#x27;s natural home was the Conservative Party.

Owen was approached privately by Tony Blair, then leader of the Opposition, in 1996 on whether he was ready to support New Labour. Lord Owen declined mainly because he disagreed with Blair&#x27;s intention, as prime minister, to join the eurozone. In 2019, Owen recounted that Blair implied that a “political future” awaited him if he rejoined Labour. Owen said he &quot;was very tempted, but then [Blair] started to talk about the euro.” Owen concluded that Blair was “passionately committed” to taking Britain into the Euro; thus, Owen said no.

In May 2005, he was approached two days before the general election by someone very close to Tony Blair to endorse Labour. He declined, because though he did not want a Conservative government, he wanted the Liberal Democrats to do sufficiently well to ensure a greatly reduced Labour majority. In September 2007, it was reported in the British press that Lord Owen had met the new prime minister Gordon Brown and afterwards had refused to rule out supporting Labour at the next general election. It later emerged that he could have been part of the &quot;government of all the talents&quot; initiative advising on the NHS, but Owen declined. In October 2009 he wrote an article in &quot;The Times&quot; predicting that the Conservatives, then well ahead in the opinion polls, were unlikely to win an outright majority. He helped create the web-based Charter 2010 to explain and promote the potential of a hung parliament. The website campaign was launched in January 2010 while the Conservatives still appeared on course to win outright. Within weeks the polls changed and the website became a major source of information about hung parliaments. In May 2010 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called Owen &quot;the prophet of the coalition&quot;.

During the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum he signed a letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating that he opposed AV but would continue to campaign for proportional representation.

In January 2011, Owen said that his &quot;heart was with Labour&quot; and that he looked forward to the time when he could vote Labour again. He added that what hampered him in the past was the way the Labour Party elects its leader and it was very necessary for the electoral college arrangement to be reformed and he refused to rule out joining the Labour Party in the future. He vigorously opposed the Health and Social Care Bill in 2011–12. In a pamphlet, &quot;Fatally Flawed&quot;, he demonstrated that far from the internal market, which he had championed in the 1980s, the Bill introduced an external market and he worked closely with the Labour Front Bench in the House of Lords. In March 2014, it was revealed that Owen had donated over £7,500 to the Labour Party, following the Labour leader Ed Miliband&#x27;s reforms of the party&#x27;s links with trade unions. No longer eligible to sit as a crossbencher, Owen now sits in the House of Lords as an &quot;Independent Social Democrat&quot;. Owen later said he admired Miliband&#x27;s &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;guts&quot;.

In the June 2017 general election, Owen made no political donation nationally although he was &quot;pleasantly surprised that the manifesto was a lot better than expected&quot;, and praised Corbyn for showing &quot;more flexibility in taking account of Labour MPs and party members’ views than ever Michael Foot did&quot; in reference to the manifesto&#x27;s commitments to NATO and nuclear weapons despite Corbyn&#x27;s lifelong pacifism. He did, however, make a personal donation to the Labour candidate in his former constituency of Plymouth Sutton &amp; Devonport, Luke Pollard, who successfully won the seat.

However in March 2019, Owen said he would not support Labour, criticising Corbyn&#x27;s leadership for its failure to &quot;unequivocally&quot; root out antisemitism in the Labour Party. In October 2019, Owen warned that Labour would lose potentially 5 million Leave voters who supported them due to its stance for a second Brexit referendum, and said that Labour under Corbyn and John McDonnell reminded voters of &quot;the Labour Party of the 1980s&quot;. He also criticised McDonnell&#x27;s push to change Labour&#x27;s policy to a second referendum stance. In the subsequent December 2019 general election, true to Owen&#x27;s warning, Labour lost 60 seats, including long time Labour seats in the red wall which supported leaving the EU.

Owen retired from the House of Lords on 13 August 2024.

==Subsequent international role==
In August 1992, Owen was British Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s choice to succeed Lord Carrington as the EU co-chairman of the Conference for the Former Yugoslavia, along with Cyrus Vance, the former US Secretary of State as the UN co-chairman.

&quot;Private Eye&quot;, the British satirical magazine, playfully alluded towards Owen&#x27;s legendary tendency towards self-destruction. &quot;It&#x27;s a lost cause&quot;, says the bubble emanating from Major&#x27;s mouth. &quot;I&#x27;m your man&quot;, says the bubble from Owen&#x27;s mouth. The Labour Shadow Foreign Minister, Jack Cunningham, greeted Major&#x27;s appointment of Owen in the British House of Commons by saying that the Prime Minister&#x27;s choice &quot;was regarded as somewhat eccentric by [MPs] and myself – he [Owen] is known for many qualities, but not as a mediator. Indeed he has Balkanised a few political parties himself.&quot;

Some believe David Owen comes across badly in Adam Le Bor&#x27;s book, &quot;Milosevic: A Biography&quot;: &quot;After he was appointed the European Community negotiator for the former Yugoslavia in 1992, Lord Owen and his wife Debbie cultivated a personal friendship with Milosevic and his wife Mira, flying in a helicopter to lunch with them in one of Tito&#x27;s former palaces and offering publishing advice to Mira Milosevic&quot;. In August 1992, five months after the Bosnian war started, Owen said, &quot;Now it is clear that Milosevic really wants peace&quot;.

Owen became a joint author of the Vance–Owen Peace Plan (VOPP), in January 1993, which made an effort to move away from the presumption of ethnic partition. According to America&#x27;s last ambassador to Yugoslavia, the Bosnian Government were ready to accept the VOPP, but unfortunately the Clinton Administration delayed in its support, thus missing a chance to get it launched. The VOPP was eventually agreed in Athens in May 1993 under intense pressure by all parties including Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić but then rejected later by the Bosnian-Serb Assembly meeting in Pale, after Karadžić insisted that the Assembly had the right to ratify the agreement. After Vance&#x27;s withdrawal, Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg brokered the EU Action Plan of December 1993. They both helped the Contact Group of the US/UK/France/Germany and Russia to present its plan in the summer of 1994.

In early 1994, the European Parliament voted by 160 votes to 90, with 2 abstentions, for Owen&#x27;s dismissal, but he was supported by all 15 EU Member State governments. There was a perception in America that Owen was &quot;not fulfilling his function as an impartial negotiator&quot;. Owen, however, was consistently supported by all 15 EU Member States and the German Presidency in July 1994 urged him to remain as did the French Presidency in January 1995. Owen was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for his services in the former Yugoslavia in 1994.

In January 1995, Lord Owen wrote to François Mitterrand as President of the European Union to say that he wished to step down before the end of the French presidency. At the end of May 1995, he was succeeded by the former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt. &quot;Had I been younger, I would probably have resigned when the Americans ditched the Vance-Owen Peace Plan&quot;.

Owen testified as a witness of the court in the trial of Slobodan Milošević, the former president of FR Yugoslavia.

==Later political commentary==
Lord Owen has continued to speak out on issues of international affairs including on nuclear proliferation and constrained intervention. In 2011 he was the first politician to call for a &quot;no-fly zone&quot; over Libya. In an editorial on 27 February 2011 the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; said, &quot;It was a man who has not been in office for nearly 32 years – Lord Owen, the former foreign secretary – who has been the most eloquent British voice over Libya. His call for a no-fly-zone ... struck the right note&quot;.

===Contaminated blood scandal===
As former Minister of State for Health, Lord Owen has long been highly critical of previous governments for their role in and handling of the tainted blood scandal. Alleging maladministration in 2002 he sought to bring about an inquiry into the matter and was joined in his efforts by former Solicitor General for England and Wales Lord Archer, former Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Services Lord Jenkin and others.

In 2009 the culmination of these efforts, the privately funded and independent &quot;Archer Report&quot; in which Lord Owen was heavily involved, published its findings but was thwarted because it had no power to compel witnesses as it was not a statutory public inquiry. Successive governments have refused to hold a public inquiry into the matter and continue to withhold documentation on grounds of commercial interest.

During his investigation into the matter he attempted to access his archived documents and files from his time as minister. At first he was told &quot;they couldn&#x27;t find them&quot; and was later told they had all been destroyed; the exact series of events that led to the destruction of these documents remains a mystery and continues to raise questions amongst MPs such as Alistair Burt. Lord Owen has regularly told the media that he is not a conspiracy theorist but that he does suspect there has been a cover-up carried out by the Civil Service and that this was done after prosecutions and jail sentences were brought against government officials in France.

In September 2016 at a film-screening of the documentary &quot;Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale&quot;, he dramatically ended a 15-minute speech on the subject proclaiming: &quot;I have failed and I feel very miserable about it&quot;.

In October 2016, the Civil Service Commission refused a request to investigate Lord Owen&#x27;s destroyed documents and separately the Department of Health advised that &quot;the Department does not have any plans to make public the identity of junior officials involved in this matter&quot;.

On 10 May 2017 he featured in an episode of &quot;BBC Panorama&quot; called &quot;Contaminated Blood: The Search for the Truth&quot;.

On 22 September 2020, Lord Owen gave evidence to the Infected Blood Inquiry in London. As part of his testimony he said: &quot;We should have realised how dangerous it was to rely on blood coming in from abroad from people who were given blood for money&quot;.

===European Union and subsequent support for Brexit===
Owen had previously been a supporter of Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Union (saying that he was &quot;not a Eurosceptic&quot; and a &quot;convinced European&quot;), but in recent years has opposed what he sees as the increased federalisation of the EU, citing examples such as a unified currency (the euro), a unified defence force and a unified foreign policy as &quot;structure[s] for a United States of Europe&quot;.

As chairman of New Europe, he was the co-leader of the &#x27;No to the Euro&#x27; campaign with Business for Sterling, which ceased when the UK Government declared in 2005 that Euro membership was off the agenda following the defeat of the EU Constitution in referendums in France and the Netherlands.

He called for a referendum before Britain&#x27;s ratification of the Lisbon treaty, and expressed concerns about proposals for the creation of a &#x27;European Rapid Reaction Force&#x27;. In February 2010, he wrote a pamphlet for the Social Market Foundation thinktank entitled &quot;EU Social Market and Social Policy&quot;. Owen supports the referendum requirements within the European Union Act 2011.

Lord Owen continued to argue for engagement, criticising David Cameron&#x27;s so-called &#x27;veto&#x27; in December 2011 and arguing instead for a formal non-eurozone grouping with the right to join or leave the eurozone. In June 2012 Lord Owen published &quot;Europe Restructured&quot;, outlining a blueprint for restructuring the EU to allow for those countries that wish to be part of a more integrated eurozone to be facilitated while those who may only want to belong to a Single Market community are enabled to do so. He stated that a referendum on the UK&#x27;s relationship with the EU was inevitable.

In February 2016, he announced that he was backing the UK leaving the EU for the 2016 referendum, arguing that &quot;There are many positive aspects to leaving the EU. ... It could be the spark we need to re-energise our nation: a challenge and an opportunity.&quot; He has supported Vote Leave and spoken at rallies against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which Owen stated would put the NHS in danger. Owen also cited his support for Brexit due to his opposition to the concept of a United States of Europe and stated that the Eurozone was “broken”, condemning how the EU treated Greece during its debt crisis.

Owen was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

=== Ukraine ===
In February 2022 he signed a letter to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, alongside Robert Skidelsky and others, about Ukraine, in which he said, &quot;NATO governments have rightly said they are willing to address Russia’s security concerns, but then say in the same breath that Russia has no legitimate security concerns because NATO is a purely defensive alliance. Whether we like it or not, a NATO that now borders Russia and could in future border even more of Russia is seen by Russia as a security concern.&quot;

==Enterprises and affiliations==

Lord Owen was chairman of Yukos International UK BV, a division of the former Russian petroleum company Yukos, from 2002 to 2005. and a member of the board of Abbott Laboratories, a US healthcare company, from 1996 to 2011. He was non-executive chairman of Europe Steel Ltd and consultant to Epion Holdings, owned by Alisher Usmanov until 2015. From 2009 to 2014 Lord Owen served on the board of Texas-based Hyperdynamics Corporation, an oil concern with an exclusive lease to an offshore area of the Republic of Guinea in west Africa.. He also served on the board of Coats Viyella from 1994 to 2001.

Owen was the Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, from 1996 to 2009. He has written extensively on the interaction between illness and politics, with a particular emphasis on the &#x27;hubris syndrome&#x27;, a condition affecting those at the pinnacle of power. The concept has been most fully developed in a co-authored paper in &quot;Brain&quot;. The concept of hubris syndrome has been analysed by Professor Gerald Russell. Lord Owen is chairman of the Trustees of the Daedalus Trust established to promote and provide funds for the interdisciplinary study of how &#x27;the intoxication of power&#x27; in all walks of life can affect personality and decision making.

==Personal life==
He married Deborah Owen (née Schabert), an American literary agent, in 1968. They have two sons and one daughter, Tristan, Gareth and Lucy.

==In popular culture==
Owen was a main character in Steve Waters&#x27; 2017 play &quot;Limehouse&quot;, which premiered at the Donmar Warehouse; Owen was portrayed by Tom Goodman-Hill, with Nathalie Armin playing his wife.

<text>Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all marsupials as well as many extinct non-marsupial relatives. It is one of two groups placed in the clade Theria alongside Eutheria, which contains the placentals. Remains of metatherians have been found on all of Earth’s continents.

== Description ==
Distinctive characteristics (synapomorphies) of Metatheria include a prehensile tail, the development of a capitular tail on the humerus, the loss of tooth replacement on the second and fifth premolars, lower canines that outwardly diverge from each other, an angular process on the dentary bone—which additionally bears a posterior shelf in its masseteric fossa in Metatheria—that is equal to or greater than the length of the ramus, and the lower fifth premolar with a &quot;very trenchant&quot; cristid obliqua/ectolophid. The permanent, retained deciduous fifth premolars are molar like and were historically identified as first molars, with the third premolar found in basal therians being lost, leaving four premolars in the halves of each jaw. &quot;Sinodelphys&quot; differs in its dentition and may represent a basal metatherian.

== Evolutionary history ==
The relationships between the three extant divisions of mammals (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals) was long a matter of debate among taxonomists. Most morphological evidence comparing traits, such as the number and arrangement of teeth and the structure of the reproductive and waste elimination systems, favors a closer evolutionary relationship between marsupials and placental mammals than either has with the monotremes, as does most genetic and molecular evidence.

The earliest possible known metatherian is &quot;Sinodelphys szalayi&quot;, which lived in China during the Early Cretaceous around 125 million years ago (mya). This makes it a contemporary to some early eutherian species that have been found in the same area. However, Bi &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) reinterpreted &quot;Sinodelphys&quot; as an early member of Eutheria. The oldest uncontested metatherians are now 110 million year old fossils from western North America. Metatherians were widespread in Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous, including both Deltatheroida and Marsupialiformes, with fossils also known from Europe during this time. During the Late Cretaceous, metatherians were more diverse than eutherians in North America. Metatherians underwent a severe decline during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, more severe than that suffered by contemporary eutherians and multituberculates, and were slower to recover diversity.

Morphological and species diversity of metatherians in Laurasia remained low in comparison to eutherians throughout the Cenozoic. The two major groups of Cenozoic Laurasian metatherians, the opossum-like herpetotheriids and peradectids persisted into the Miocene before becoming extinct, with the North American herpetotheriid &quot;Herpetotherium&quot;, the European herpetotheriid &quot;Amphiperatherium&quot; and the peradectids &quot;Siamoperadectes&quot; and &quot;Sinoperadectes&quot; from Asia being the youngest Laurasian non-marsupial metatherians (with marsupials invading North America during the Pliocene-Pleistocene as part of the Great American interchange). Metatherians first arrived in Afro-Arabia during the Paleogene, probably from Europe, including the possible peradectoid &quot;Kasserinotherium&quot; from the Early Eocene of Tunisia and the herpetotheriid &quot;Peratherium africanum&quot; from the Early Oligocene of Egypt and Oman. The youngest African metatherian is the possible herpetotheriid &quot;Morotodon&quot; from the late Early Miocene of Uganda.

Metatherians arrived in South America from North America during the latest Cretaceous or Paleocene and underwent a major diversificiation, with South American metatherians including both the ancestors of extant marsupials as well as the extinct Sparassodonta, which were major predators in South American ecosystems during most of the Cenozoic, up until their extinction in the Pliocene, as well as the Polydolopimorphia, which likely had a wide range of diets. Metatherians then declined in diversity in South America during the Late Eocene as well as the later Oligocene epoch. The oldest known Australian marsupials are from the early Eocene, and are thought to have arrived in the region after having dispersed via Antarctica from South America. During the Oligocene epoch, Australian metatherians radiated rapidly, which contributed most to the global peak in metatherian diversity during the Early Miocene. The only known Antarctic metatherians are from the Early Eocene La Meseta Formation of the Antarctic Peninsula, where they are the most diverse group of mammals, and include marsupials as well as polydolopimorphians.

<doc id="217418" wikidata="Q271569" url="?curid=217418" title="Pat Hitchcock">
<text>Patricia Alma Hitchcock O&#x27;Connell (7 July 1928 – 9 August 2021) was an English-American actress and producer. She was the only child of English director Alfred Hitchcock and film editor Alma Reville, and had small roles in several of her father&#x27;s films, with her most substantial appearance being in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951).

==Early life==
Hitchcock was born on 7 July 1928 in London, the only child of film director Alfred Hitchcock and film editor Alma Reville. The family moved to Los Angeles, California in 1939.

As a child, Hitchcock knew she wanted to be an actress, and made her first onscreen appearance as an uncredited extra alongside her mother in &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936). In the early 1940s, she began acting on the stage and doing summer stock. Her father helped her gain a role in the Broadway production of &quot;Solitaire&quot; (1942). She also played the title role in the Broadway play &quot;Violet&quot; (1944).

After graduating from Marymount High School in Los Angeles in 1947, she attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and also appeared on the London stage.

==Career==
In early 1949, her parents arrived in London to make &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, Hitchcock&#x27;s first British-made feature film since emigrating to Hollywood. Pat did not know she would have a walk-on part in the film until her parents arrived. Because she bore a resemblance to the star, Jane Wyman, her father asked if she would mind also doubling for Wyman in the scenes that required &quot;danger driving&quot;. 

She had supporting roles in three of her father&#x27;s films. In &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), she played a jolly acting student named Chubby Bannister, one of Wyman&#x27;s school chums; &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), playing Barbara Morton, sister of Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the lover of Guy Haines (Farley Granger); and Caroline in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). In this role, she offers to share her tranquilizers with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), having received them from her mother prior to her wedding night. Hitchcock was an extra in her father&#x27;s film &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936). She and her mother, Alma Reville, are in the crowd waiting for, then watching, the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show parade.

Hitchcock also worked for Jean Negulesco on &quot;The Mudlark&quot; (1950), which starred Irene Dunne and Alec Guinness, playing a palace maid, and again was cast as a maid in the first episode of the 1953 television series &quot;Life with Father&quot;. She had a bit-part in DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956).

As well as appearing in ten episodes of her father&#x27;s half-hour television programme, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, Hitchcock worked on a few others, including &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, which was live, directed by John Frankenheimer. Acting for her father, however, remained the high point of her acting career, which she interrupted to bring up her children. (Hitchcock has a small joke with her first appearance on his show – after saying good night and exiting the screen, he sticks his head back into the picture and remarks: &quot;I thought the little leading lady was rather good, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;)

She also served as executive producer of the documentary &quot;The Man on Lincoln&#x27;s Nose&quot; (2000), which is about Robert F. Boyle and his contribution to films.

For several years, she was the family representative on the staff of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. She supplied family photos and wrote the foreword of the book &quot;Footsteps in the Fog: Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s San Francisco&quot; (2002) by Jeff Kraft and Aaron Leventhal. A biography of her mother, &quot;Alma Hitchcock: The Woman Behind the Man&quot;, was co-written with Laurent Bouzereau, and published in 2003.

==Personal life==

Hitchcock married Joseph E. O&#x27;Connell, Jr., son of Boston businessman Joseph E. O&#x27;Connell, on 17 January 1952, at Our Lady Chapel in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York. The couple had three daughters, Mary Alma Stone, Teresa &quot;Terry&quot; Carrubba, and Kathleen &quot;Katie&quot; Fiala. O&#x27;Connell died in 1994.

Hitchcock died of natural causes in her sleep at her home in Thousand Oaks, California, on 9 August 2021, one month after her 93rd birthday. Her daughter Teresa made the following statement: &quot;She was always really good at protecting the legacy of my grandparents and making sure they were always remembered. ... It&#x27;s sort of an end of an era now that they&#x27;re all gone.&quot;

<text>Alma Lucy Reville, Lady Hitchcock (14 August 1899 – 6 July 1982) was an English screenwriter and film editor. She was the wife of film director Alfred Hitchcock. She collaborated on scripts for her husband&#x27;s films, including &quot;Shadow of a Doubt, Suspicion&quot;, and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, as well as scripts for other directors, including Henrik Galeen, Maurice Elvey, and Berthold Viertel.

==Early life and career==
Reville was born on 14 August 1899 in St. Ann&#x27;s Nottingham (one day after her future husband), the second daughter of Matthew Edward and Lucy () Reville. The family moved to London when Reville was young, as her father gained a job at Twickenham Film Studios. Reville often visited her father at work and eventually obtained a job there as a tea girl. At 16, she was promoted to the position of cutter, which involved assisting directors in editing the motion pictures. Of editing, she wrote, &quot;The art of cutting is Art indeed, with a capital A, and is of far greater importance than is generally acknowledged.&quot; She continued to work there as a scriptwriter and director&#x27;s assistant. These roles enabled her to become involved in areas of film-making to which women would then rarely have access.

Twickenham Film Studio, where Reville first worked, closed in 1919, but she was given a job at Paramount&#x27;s Famous Players–Lasky, a subsidiary of the American company based in Islington, where she met her future husband, Alfred Hitchcock. The same company gave him a job as a graphic designer before he became an art editor. The first film Reville worked on with Hitchcock was &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; (1923), with Reville as film editor, and Hitchcock as art director and assistant editor.

As well as editing, writing and other production roles, Reville also appeared on screen making three film appearances: a lead role in &quot;The Life Story of David Lloyd George&quot; (1918), and as an extra in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot; (1927) and &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936).

==Marriage and collaborations==

Hitchcock and Reville married on 2 December 1926 at Brompton Oratory in London after Reville converted to Roman Catholicism from Protestantism, apparently at the behest of Hitchcock&#x27;s mother. Reville was baptized on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at Westminster Cathedral by Francis Cardinal Bourne on 5 June. In 1928, when they learned that she was pregnant, the Hitchcocks purchased &quot;Winter&#x27;s Grace&quot;, a Tudor farmhouse set in 11 acres (4.45 ha) on Stroud Lane, Shamley Green, Surrey, for £2,500. Their daughter and only child, Patricia Alma Hitchcock, was born on 7 July that year.

Reville co-wrote &quot;The Ring&quot; (1927) – the first screenwriting credit she shared with Hitchcock – but worked with other directors as well. She co-wrote &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1928), the first film adaptation of the best-selling novel &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1924) by Margaret Kennedy, directed by Adrian Brunel. In 1929, Reville co-wrote &quot;After the Verdict&quot;, directed by Henrik Galeen and &quot;A Romance of Seville&quot;, directed by Norman Walker. In 1931 and 1932 she worked with directors such as Harry Lachman, Maurice Elvey and Basil Dean. In 1933, Hitchcock hired Joan Harrison as his assistant, and she assumed many of Reville&#x27;s roles within his productions. She continued to work with some other directors, including Phil Rosen in 1934, Berthold Viertel in 1935 and Richard Wallace in 1945. Reville focused primarily on preparing and adapting her husband&#x27;s scripts, including those for &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (both 1940), &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941) and &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942).

Reville worked with her husband on many more scripts in Hollywood. She collaborated with Joan Harrison on the script of &quot;Suspicion&quot;, which was completed on 28 November 1940. They worked on it in the Hitchcocks&#x27; home in Bel Air, as Hitchcock preferred writing in a comfortable, intimate environment rather than an office.

Reville had a keen ear for dialogue and an editor&#x27;s sharp eye for scrutinising a film&#x27;s final version for continuity flaws so minor they had escaped the notice of the director or the crew. It was Reville who noticed Janet Leigh inadvertently swallowing after her character&#x27;s fatal encounter in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), necessitating an alteration to the negative.

Reville was Hitchcock&#x27;s closest collaborator and sounding board. Charles Champlin wrote in 1982: &quot;The Hitchcock touch had four hands, and two were Alma&#x27;s.&quot; When Hitchcock accepted the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979, he said he wanted to mention &quot;four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter, Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen. And their names are Alma Reville&quot;.

==Death==
Reville survived a bout of breast cancer. She died on 6 July 1982, at the age of 82, two years after her husband. She was cremated and had her ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

==In popular culture==
Reville was portrayed by Imelda Staunton in &quot;The Girl&quot; (2012), and Helen Mirren in &quot;&quot;Hitchcock&quot;&quot; (2012). Staunton was nominated for a BAFTA and a Primetime Emmy for her performance, while Mirren was nominated for BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG awards for her performance.

==Legacy==
In 1999, on the 100th anniversary of her birth, a plaque to Reville was unveiled in Nottingham, near the site of her birth, as part of the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Centenary of Cinema&quot; celebrations.

<doc id="217422" wikidata="Q1552613" url="?curid=217422" title="Omega Point">
<text>The Omega Point is a theorized future event in which the entirety of the universe spirals toward a final point of unification. The term was invented by the French Jesuit Catholic priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955). Teilhard argued that the Omega Point resembles the Christian Logos, namely Christ, who draws all things into himself, who in the words of the Nicene Creed, is &quot;God from God&quot;, &quot;Light from Light&quot;, &quot;True God from True God&quot;, and &quot;through him all things were made&quot;. In the Book of Revelation, Christ describes himself three times as &quot;the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end&quot;. Several decades after Teilhard&#x27;s death, the idea of the Omega Point was expanded upon in the writings of John David Garcia (1971), Paolo Soleri (1981), Frank Tipler (1994), and David Deutsch (1997).

==Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s theory==

===Etymology===

Teilhard de Chardin was a paleontologist and Roman Catholic priest in the Jesuit order. In France in the 1920s, he began incorporating his theories of the universe into lectures that placed Catholicism and evolution in the same conversation. Because of these lectures, he was suspected by the Holy Office of denying the doctrine of original sin. This caused Teilhard to be exiled to China and banned from publication by Church authorities. It was not until one year after his death in 1955 that his writings were published for the world to read. His works were also supported by the writings of a group of Catholic thinkers, which includes Pope Benedict XVI. His book &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot; has been dissected by astrophysicists and cosmologists, and is now viewed as a work positing a theological or philosophical theory that cannot be scientifically proven. Teilhard, who was not a cosmologist, opens his books with the statement: 
===Evolution===

According to Teilhard, evolution does not end with mankind, and Earth&#x27;s biosphere evolved before humans existed. He described evolution as a progression that begins with inanimate matter to a future state of Divine consciousness through Earth&#x27;s &quot;hominization&quot;. He also maintained that one-cell organisms develop into metazoans or animals, but some of the members of this classification develop organisms with complex nervous systems. This group has the capability to acquire intelligence. When &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; inhabited Earth through evolution, a noosphere, the cognitive layer of existence, was created. As evolution continues, the noosphere gains coherence. Teilhard explained that this noosphere can be moved toward or constructed to be the Omega Point or the final evolutionary stage with the help of science. Teilhard refers to this process as &quot;planetization.&quot; Eventually, the noosphere gains total dominance over the biosphere and reaches a point of complete independence from tangential energy forming a metaphysical being, called the Omega Point.

===Energy===

Energy exists in two basic modes:
# &quot;Tangential Energy&quot;: energy that can be measured by physics.
# &quot;Radial Energy&quot;: spiritual energy which accumulates into a higher state as time progresses.

Teilhard defines Radial Energy as becoming more concentrated and available as it is a critical element in man&#x27;s evolution. The theory applies to all forms of matter, concluding that everything with existence has some sort of life. In regard to Teilhard&#x27;s &quot;The Phenomenon of Man&quot;, Peter Medawar wrote, &quot;Teilhard&#x27;s radial, spiritual, or psychic energy may be equated to &#x27;information&#x27; or &#x27;information content&#x27; in the sense that has been made reasonably precise by communication engineers.&quot;

===Formal properties===

Teilhard&#x27;s theory is based on four &quot;properties&quot;:
# Humans will escape the heat death of the universe. He theorizes that since radial energy is non-compliant with entropy, it escapes the collapses of forces at world&#x27;s end.
# The Omega Point does not exist within the timeline of the universe, it occurs at the exact edge of the end of time. From that point, all sequences of existence are sucked into its being.
# The Omega Point can be understood as a volume shaped like a cone in which each section, taken from the base to its summit, decreases until it diminishes into a final point.
# The volume described in the Third Property must be understood as an entity with finite boundaries. Teilhard explains: 
===Forces of compression===

Teilhard calls the contributing universal energy that generates the Omega Point &quot;forces of compression&quot;. Unlike the scientific definition, which incorporates gravity and mass, Teilhard&#x27;s forces of compression are sourced from communication and contact between human beings. This value is limitless and directly correlated with entropy. It suggests that as humans continue to interact, consciousness evolves and grows. For the theory to occur, humans must also be bound to the finite earth. The creation of this boundary forces the world&#x27;s convergence upon itself which he theorizes to result in time ending in communion with the Omega Point-God. This portion of Teilhard&#x27;s thinking shows his lack of expectation for humans to engage in space travel and transcend the bounds of Earth.

== The Omega Point cosmology ==


Mathematical physicist Frank Tipler generalized Teilhard&#x27;s term &quot;Omega Point&quot; to describe what he alleges is the ultimate fate of the universe as required by the laws of physics: roughly, Tipler argues that quantum mechanics is inconsistent unless the future of every point in spacetime contains an intelligent observer to collapse the wavefunction and that the only way for this to happen is if the Universe is closed (that is, it will collapse to a single point) and yet contains observers with a &quot;God-like&quot; ability to perform an unbounded series of observations in finite time. Tipler&#x27;s conception of the Omega Point is regarded as pseudoscience by some scientists. 

The originator of quantum computing, Oxford&#x27;s David Deutsch, wrote about how a universal quantum computer could bring about Tipler&#x27;s salvation in his 1997 book, &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;.

==Theological controversy==
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s life (1881–1955) was bracketed by the First Vatican Council (1869) and the Second Vatican Council (1965). He was born 20 years after the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;; soon after, the claims of scientific theories and those of traditional theological teachings became of great interest to the Vatican.

In 1946, Pope Pius XII stated his concern about the theory of evolution, albeit without condemning it:

Teilhard&#x27;s theory was a personal attempt in creating a new Christianity in which science and theology coexist. The outcome was that his theory of the Omega Point was not perfectly scientific as examined by physicists, and not perfectly Christian either. By 1962, The Society of Jesus had strayed from Spanish Jesuit Priest Francisco Suarez&#x27;s philosophies on Man in favor of &quot;Teilhardian evolutionary cosmogenesis.&quot; Teilhard&#x27;s Christ is the &quot;Cosmic Christ&quot; or the &quot;Omega&quot; of revelation. He is an emanation of God which is made of matter and experienced the nature of evolution by being born into this world and dying. His resurrection from the dead was not to heaven, but to the noosphere, the area of convergence of all spirituality and spiritual beings, where Christ will be waiting at the end of time. When the earth reaches its Omega Point, everything that exists will become one with divinity.

Teilhard reaffirmed the role of the Church in the following letter to Auguste Valensin. It is important to note that he defines evolution as a scientific phenomenon set in motion by God – that science and the divine are interconnected and acting through one another:

=== Accelerating expansion of the universe ===

In 1998, a value measured from observations of Type Ia supernovae seemed to indicate that what was once assumed to be temporary cosmological expansion was actually accelerating. The apparent acceleration has caused further dismissal of the validity of Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point, since the necessity of a final big crunch singularity is key to the Omega Point&#x27;s workability. However, Tipler believes that the Omega Point is still workable, arguing that a big crunch/ final singularity is still required under many current universal models.

===Technological singularity===
The technological singularity is the hypothetical advent of artificial general intelligence becoming capable of recursive self-improvement, resulting in an irreversible machine intelligence explosion, with unknown impact on humanity. Eric Steinhart, a proponent of &quot;Christian transhumanism,&quot; argues there is a significant overlap of ideas between the secular singularity and Teilhard&#x27;s religious Omega Point. Steinhart quotes Ray Kurzweil, who stated that &quot;evolution moves inexorably toward our conception of God, albeit never reaching this ideal.&quot; Like Kurzweil, Teilhard predicted a period of rapid technological change that results in a merger of humanity and technology. He believes that this marks the birth of the noosphere and the emergence of the &quot;spirit of the Earth,&quot; but the Teilhardian Singularity comes later. Unlike Kurzweil, Teilhard&#x27;s singularity is marked by the evolution of human intelligence reaching a critical point in which humans ascend from &quot;transhuman&quot; to &quot;posthuman.&quot; He identifies this with the Christian &quot;parousia.&quot;

==In popular culture==

The Spanish painter Salvador Dalí was familiar with Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s Omega Point theory. His 1959 painting &quot;The Ecumenical Council&quot; is said to represent the &quot;interconnectedness&quot; of the Omega Point. &quot;Point Omega&quot; by Don DeLillo takes its name from the theory and involves a character who is studying Teilhard de Chardin. Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s acclaimed collection of short stories refers to the Omega Point theory in its title, &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot;, and science fiction writer Frederik Pohl references Frank Tipler and the Omega Point in his 1998 short story &quot;The Siege of Eternity&quot;. Scottish writer / counterculture figure Grant Morrison has used the Omega Point as a plot line in several of his Justice League of America and Batman stories.

Julian May&#x27;s Galactic Milieu Series includes multiple references to Chardin, the Omega Point and the Noosphere. Part of the driving force for the Milieu of the title is to promote an increase in the population of various intelligent species, including humans, in order to enable them to reach a point of psychic Unity.

Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter&#x27;s &quot;The Light of Other Days&quot; references Teilhard de Chardin and includes a brief explanation of the Omega Point. Italian writer Valerio Evangelisti has used the Omega Point as main theme of his &quot;Il Fantasma di Eymerich&quot; novel. In William Peter Blatty&#x27;s novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, the character of Father Merrin references Omega Point. In 2021, Dutch symphonic metal band Epica released their eighth studio album, &quot;Omega&quot;, which features concepts related to the Omega Point theory. Epica&#x27;s guitarist and vocalist, Mark Jansen, specifically referenced Teilhard&#x27;s theory when describing the album&#x27;s concept.

Charles Sheffield&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot; also uses the concept in the concluding act of the novel.

<doc id="217428" wikidata="Q708387" url="?curid=217428" title="Abitur">
<text>Abitur (), often shortened colloquially to &quot;Abi&quot;, is a qualification granted at the end of secondary education in Germany. It is conferred on students who pass their final exams at the end of ISCED 3, usually after twelve or thirteen years of schooling (see also, for Germany, &quot;Abitur&quot; after twelve years). In German, the term has roots in the archaic word , which in turn was derived from the Latin (future active participle of , thus &quot;someone who is going to leave&quot;).

As a matriculation examination, &quot;Abitur&quot; can be compared to A levels, the &quot;Matura&quot; or the International Baccalaureate Diploma, which are all ranked as level 4 in the European Qualifications Framework.

==In Germany==
===Overview===
The (&quot;certificate of general qualification for university entrance&quot;), often referred to as (&quot;&quot;Abitur&quot; certificate&quot;), issued after candidates have passed their final exams and have had appropriate grades in both the last and second last school year, is the document which contains their grades and formally enables them to attend university. Thus, it encompasses the functions of both a school graduation certificate and a college entrance exam.

Abitur confers (allows students to enter university or Fachhochschule), while there are other ways of obtaining it. In 2005, some 231,000 students obtained in Germany. This number rose over time to around 263,000 in 2021. Of those, most obtained their at a Gymnasium, while 40,000 received it at a different kind of school, most notably at Gesamtschulen. If those who obtain the &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; (144,399 in 2012) are also added, then the total of those who obtained the right to study at a university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; is 395,000 (2021).

===History===
Until the eighteenth century, every German university had its own entrance examination. In 1788 Prussia introduced the , a law, for the first time within Germany, establishing the &quot;Abitur&quot; as an official qualification. It was later also established in the other German states. In 1834, it became the only university entrance exam in Prussia, and it remained so in all states of Germany until 1998. Since then, the German state of Hesse allows students with &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; (see below) to study at the universities within that state.

===Equivalency===

The academic level of the &quot;Abitur&quot; is comparable to the International Baccalaureate, the GCE Advanced Level and the Advanced Placement tests. The study requirements for the International Baccalaureate differ little from the German exam requirements. It is the only school-leaving certificate in all states of Germany that allows the graduate (or &quot;Abiturient&quot;) to move directly to university. The other school leaving certificates, the &quot;Hauptschulabschluss&quot; and the &quot;Realschulabschluss&quot;, do not allow their holders to matriculate at a university. Those granted certificates of &quot;Hauptschulabschluss&quot; or &quot;Realschulabschluss&quot; can gain a specialized &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; or an &quot;Abitur&quot; if they graduate from a &quot;Berufsschule&quot; and then attend &quot;Berufsoberschule&quot; or graduate from a &quot;Fachoberschule&quot;.

However, the &quot;Abitur&quot; is not the only path to university studies, as some universities set up their own entrance examinations. Students who successfully passed a &quot;Begabtenprüfung&quot; (&quot;aptitude test&quot;) are also eligible. Students from other countries who hold a high school leaving certificate that is not counted as being equivalent to the &quot;Abitur&quot; (such as the American high school diploma) and who do well enough on the ACT or SAT test, may also enter German universities. A person who does not hold the &quot;Abitur&quot; and did not take an aptitude test may still be admitted to university by completing at least the 10th grade and doing well on an IQ test (see: Hochbegabtenstudium).

====Other qualifications called &quot;Abitur&quot; in colloquial usage====

In German, the European Baccalaureate is called &quot;europäisches Abitur&quot;, and the International Baccalaureate is called &quot;internationales Abitur&quot;, neither to be confused with the German &quot;Abitur&quot;. The French-German Baccalaureate is called &quot;deutsch-französisches Abitur&quot;, and is equivalent both to the German Abitur and to the French Baccalauréat.

The term &quot;Fachabitur&quot; was used in all of Western Germany for a variation of the &quot;Abitur&quot; until the 1990s; the official term for the German qualification is &quot;fachgebundene Hochschulreife&quot;. This qualification includes only one foreign language (usually, English). The &quot;Abitur&quot;, in contrast, usually requires two foreign languages. The &quot;Fachabitur&quot; also allows the graduate to start studying at a university but is limited to a specified range of majors, depending on the specific subjects covered in his &quot;Fachabitur&quot; examinations. But the graduate is allowed to study for all majors at a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; (University of Applied Sciences, in some ways comparable to polytechnics). Today, the school leaving certificate is called &quot;fachgebundenes Abitur&quot; (&#x27;restricted subject &quot;Abitur&quot;″).

Now the term &quot;Fachabitur&quot; is used in most parts of Germany for the &quot;Fachhochschulreife (FHR)&quot;. It was introduced in West Germany in the 1970s together with the &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot;. It enables the graduate to start studying at a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; and, in Hesse, also at a university within that state. In the Gymnasiums of some states it is awarded in the year before the &quot;Abitur&quot; is reached. However, the normal way to obtain &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; is graduation from a German &quot;Fachoberschule&quot;, a vocational high school, also introduced in the 1970s.

The term &quot;Notabitur&quot; (&#x27;emergency &quot;Abitur&quot;″) describes a qualification used only during World War I and World War II. It was granted to male German &quot;Gymnasium&quot; students who voluntarily enlisted for military service before graduation as well as young women who were evacuated from the major cities before they could complete their &quot;Gymnasium&quot; education as planned (approximately three to five million children and teenagers had to be evacuated during the war). The &quot;Notabitur&quot; during World War I included an examination, roughly equivalent to the &quot;Abitur&quot; exam. The World War II &quot;Notabitur&quot;, in contrast, was granted without an examination. After the war this was a major disadvantage for the students concerned since, unlike its World War I counterpart, the certificate was generally not recognised in West Germany and never recognised in East Germany. Universities requested the &quot;Abitur&quot; to consist of written exams including at least two foreign languages (almost always Latin and French, the latter sometimes replaced by English). Students, who received the &quot;Notabitur&quot; during World War II were offered to re-enter school to prepare for and take the exam after the war had ended. Those special &quot;Abitur&quot; preparation classes were made up of young adults of different age and sex, which was very unusual at the time.

===Equivalent high school graduation certificate in other countries===
The equivalent graduation certificate in the Czech Republic, Austria, Poland, Italy and other countries of continental Europe is the &quot;Matura&quot;; while in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Singapore, and the West Indies, it is A-levels; in Scotland it is Higher Grade; in the Republic of Ireland it is the Leaving Certificate; in Greece and Cyprus it is the &quot;apolytirion&quot; (a kind of high school diploma); in Malta it is the Matriculation Certificate (MATSEC), in Hungary it is called &quot;Érettségi Bizonyítvány&quot; which translates to Matriculation Certificate.

In Australia, the graduation certificate awarded to high school students is the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (SSCE). However, the name of the SSCE varies from state to state. In Victoria, it is called the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in New South Wales it is called the Higher Schools Certificate (HSC).

In India various states name it differently. Each Indian state has its own examination board, some individual states having their own entrance test system. Passing the specified examination qualifies the student to enter into undergraduate program in a university. For example, in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana this is known as Board of Intermediate Examination (BIE).

For professional, specialist programs and well reputed institutions there are entrance tests. For engineering there is a Joint Engineering Entrance Joint Entrance Examination conducted at all India level. For medical undergraduate MBBS programs there is a national eligibility and entrance test known as NEET-UG National Eligibility and Entrance Test conducted at all of India. There is also an all India level examination conducted by Central Board of Secondary education CBSE the certification is known as Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC).

===Exams===
During the final examinations (&quot;Abiturprüfungen&quot;), students are tested in four or five subjects (at least one of which is oral). Procedures vary by state.
Although some tested subjects are chosen by the student, three areas must be covered:
* Language, literature and the arts
** German, Sorbian (in Saxony and Brandenburg), foreign languages (typically English, French, Latin, Greek, Spanish, Italian or Russian; rarely Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Ancient Hebrew, Turkish, Modern Greek, Portuguese or Polish).
** Music, visual or performing arts, literature
* Social sciences
** Political science, history, geography, economics
** Psychology, philosophy, religion, ethics
* Mathematics, natural sciences and technology
** Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology
** Computer science, technology, nutritional science
* Sports
Occasionally, schools (especially &quot;berufsorientierte Gymnasien&quot;) offer vocational subjects such as pedagogy, business informatics, biotechnology and mechanical engineering.

Final exams are usually taken from March to May or June. Each written basic-level examination takes about three hours; advanced-level examinations take four-and-a-half hours, and written exams are in essay format. Oral examinations last about 20 min. Papers are graded by at least two teachers at the school. In some parts of Germany students may prepare a presentation, research paper or participate in a competition, and may take additional oral exams to pass the &quot;Abitur&quot; if the written exam is poor.

Before reunification, &quot;Abitur&quot; exams were given locally in West Germany, but Bavaria has conducted centralized exams (&quot;Zentralabitur&quot;) since 1854. After reunification, most states of the former East Germany continued centralized exams, and at the beginning of the 21st century, many states adopted centralized exams. In 2013, all other states except Rheinland-Pfalz also introduced centralized written exams at least in the core subjects (German, mathematics and the first foreign language, usually English). The exams are structured as follows:
* German: Choose 1 out of 3 tasks. Topics are usually lyric poetry, classic and contemporary literature or linguistics (history and changes to the language). Each task is usually divided into two or three parts.
* English: Choose 1 out of 3 tasks. Topics may vary but are usually connected to personal identity and multiculturalism, science and technology or environmental change and globalization (politics, economy and culture). Classical literature is rarely taught, and students primarily deal with literature of the last century. Each task consists of three parts: comprehension (summary), analysis and interpretation and commentary and discussion.
* Mathematics: Choose three of six tasks, one in each area: differential and integral calculus, analytic geometry and linear algebra and probability theory. Each task is usually split into five or six smaller tasks.

The &quot;Kultusministerkonferenz&quot; (KMK) of several states expanded the exams to scientific subjects and the social sciences. The physics and chemistry exams include an experiment that must be performed and analyzed.

===Scoring===
Each semester of a subject studied in the final two years yields up to 15 points for a student, where advanced courses may count double, depending on the state. The final examinations each count quadruple.

The exact scoring system depends on the Bundesland in which one takes Abitur. Passing the &quot;Abitur&quot; usually requires a composite score of at least 50%. Students with a score below that minimum fail and do not receive an &quot;Abitur&quot;. There are some other conditions that the student also has to meet in order to receive the &quot;Abitur&quot;: taking mandatory courses in selected subject areas, and limits to the number of failing grades in core subjects. Finally, students often have the option of omitting some courses from their composite score if they have taken more courses than the minimum required.

The best possible grade of 1.0 can be achieved if the score ranges between 823 and 900 points; the fraction of students achieving this score is normally only around 0.2%–3% even among the already selective population of &quot;Abitur&quot; candidates. Around 12%–30% of &quot;Abitur&quot; candidates achieve grades between 1.0 and 1.9.

===Statistics===
Historically, very few people received their &quot;Abitur&quot; in Germany because many attractive jobs did not require one. The number of persons holding the &quot;Abitur&quot; has steadily increased since the 1970s, and younger jobholders are more likely to hold the &quot;Abitur&quot; than older ones. The percentage of students qualified for tertiary education is still lower than the OECD average.

==International Abitur==
The International Abitur is offered at schools outside Germany that are accredited by the German government. The five Abitur exams (three written exams and two oral exams) are in the following subjects: German literature, European history or economics or mathematics or a natural science or a language. In February of senior year (grade 12), all students take the written examinations for the German International Abitur in three subjects including German. In late spring, students have mandatory oral examinations in two subjects, which are overseen by a German educational official. The final GPA includes grades from both junior and senior years, as well as for the five Abitur exams. The final diploma that students receive after successful completion of these exams allows them to qualify for admission to universities in Germany.

<doc id="217429" wikidata="Q526227" url="?curid=217429" title="Shooting an Elephant">
<text>&quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; is an essay by British writer George Orwell, first published in the literary magazine &quot;New Writing&quot; in late 1936 and broadcast by the BBC Home Service on 12 October 1948.

The essay describes the experience of the English narrator, possibly Orwell himself, called upon to shoot an aggressive elephant while working as a police officer in Burma. Because the locals expect him to do the job, he does so against his better judgment, his anguish increased by the elephant&#x27;s slow and painful death. The story is regarded as a metaphor for colonialism as a whole, and for Orwell&#x27;s view that &quot;when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys&quot;.

Orwell spent some of his life in Burma in a position akin to that of the narrator, but the degree to which his account is autobiographical is disputed, with no conclusive evidence to prove it to be fact or fiction. After his death in 1950, the essay was republished several times, including in &quot;Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays&quot; (1950), &quot;Inside the Whale and Other Essays&quot; (1957), and &quot;Selected Writings&quot; (1958).

In a 2022 interview, Orwell&#x27;s son Richard Blair said he thinks &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; is one of the two best essays of his father, together with &quot;A Hanging&quot;.

==Context==

The British Empire gradually annexed Burma over a period of 63 years (1823–1886) during which three Anglo-Burmese Wars took place, and Britain incorporated it into British India. It was administered as a province of India until 1937, when it became a separate, self-governing colony, attaining its independence on January 4, 1948. With a strong interest in the lives of the working class, Orwell, born in India to a middle-class family but brought up in Britain, held the post of assistant superintendent in the British Indian Imperial Police in Burma from 1922 to 1927.

&quot;Moulmein used to be full of elephants&quot; employed to haul logs in the timber firms. &quot;Ordinary tamed elephants have been part of Burmese life for centuries... the rare and revered white elephant, is believed in Buddhist legend to be a symbol of purity and power&quot;. When Orwell moved to Moulmein, in 1926, &quot;he was most probably ambivalent about the colonial state of which he was a part. The Kipling-inspired romance of the Raj had been worn thin by the daily realities of his job in which... he witnessed &#x27;the dirty work of Empire at close quarters&#x27;&quot;. Orwell writes how he was trapped between his own resentment towards the empire and the Burmese people&#x27;s resentment towards him. As a member of the ruling power, he is cornered into doing what the &quot;natives&quot; expect of him: &quot;He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it&quot;.

==Events==
In Moulmein, the narrator, Orwell, writing in the first person, is a police officer during a period of intense anti-European sentiment. Although his intellectual sympathies lie with the Burmese, his official role makes him a symbol of the oppressive imperial power. As such, he is subjected to constant baiting and jeering by the local people.

After receiving a call regarding a normally tame elephant&#x27;s rampage, the narrator, armed with a .44 caliber Winchester rifle and riding on a pony, goes to the town in which the elephant has been seen. Entering one of the poorest quarters, he receives conflicting reports and contemplates leaving since he thinks that the incident is a hoax. The narrator then sees a village woman chasing away children who are looking at the corpse of an Indian, whom the elephant has trampled and killed. He sends an order to bring an elephant rifle and, followed by a group of roughly a few thousand people, heads toward the paddy field in which the elephant has rested in its tracks.

Although he does not want to kill the elephant since it now seems peaceful, the narrator feels pressured by the demand of the crowd for the act to be carried out. After inquiring as to the elephant&#x27;s behavior and delaying for some time, he shoots the elephant several times and wounds it but is unable to kill it. The narrator then leaves the beast since he is unable to be in its presence as it continues to suffer. He later learns that it was stripped, nearly to the bone, within hours. His elderly colleagues agree that killing the elephant was the best thing to do, but the younger ones believe that it was worth more than the Indian whom it killed. The narrator then wonders if they will ever understand that he shot it &quot;solely to avoid looking a fool&quot;.

==Themes==
===Imperialism===
An anti-imperialist writer, Orwell promoted the idea that through imperialism, both conqueror and conquered were destroyed. Orwell clearly states his displeasure with the British Empire: &quot;I had already made up my mind that imperialism was an evil thing... I was all for the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British&quot;. The narrator perceives that the conqueror is not in control, but it is rather the will of the conquered that governs his actions. As ruler, he notes that it is his duty to appear resolute, with his word being final:

Although it is not the narrator&#x27;s wish to shoot the elephant, his will is not his own and their expectation makes him realise that he must shoot the elephant: &quot;I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind&quot;. Reflectively, the narrator realises being forced to impose strict laws and to shoot the elephant. He states his feelings against the act but submits after comprehending he &quot;had got to shoot the elephant&quot;—illustrates an inherent problem of hegemony: &quot;when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys&quot;. By enforcing British colonial rule, he is both forfeiting his freedom and oppressing the Burmese.

===Conqueror and conquered===
The narrator&#x27;s situation throughout the essay is one of little prospect or prominence. He comments on how even though he is a member of the ruling class, he finds himself either largely ignored by the Burmese people or hated. He remarks in the first sentence, &quot;I was hated by large numbers of people—the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me&quot;. Only with the expectation of a killing do the locals find him &quot;momentarily worth watching&quot;. He describes how, as a police officer, he was often a target for mockery from the locals, as was any other European who provided an easy target.

Orwell recalled he faced hostility from the Burmese, &quot;in the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere, the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves&quot;. He recalled that &quot;I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make my job impossible&quot;.

In contrast to his description of the natives as &quot;little beasts&quot;, the narrator labels the elephant as a &quot;great beast&quot; and suggests that he holds it at a higher status than the locals. That is somewhat paradoxical, however, as the narrator&#x27;s own job is demeaning and forces him to see &quot;the dirty work of the Empire at close quarters&quot;. The narrator singles out &quot;young Buddhist priests&quot; to be &quot;the worst of all&quot; and comments on how he would gladly &quot;drive a bayonet into a Buddhist priest&#x27;s guts&quot;.

Having killed the elephant, the narrator considers how he was glad that it killed the &quot;coolie&quot;, as that gave him full legal backing. The essay finishes with him wondering if they will even understand his motive for having killed the elephant, as he merely wishes to salvage his pride.

===Conscience===
The narrator&#x27;s conscience plagues him greatly as he finds himself trapped between the &quot;hatred of the empire [he] served&quot; and his &quot;rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make [his] job impossible&quot;. He claims that he is &quot;all for the Burmese and all against the British&quot; and goes on to say that &quot;feelings like these are the normal by-products of imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him off duty&quot;. That creates a sense of empathy from the conquerors towards the conquered, but as they treat their conquerors badly, the conquerors start to feel less guilty and so treat them badly once more.

==Film adaptation==

In 2015, &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; was adapted into a short film by director Juan Pablo Rothie and Academy Award-nominated writer Alec Sokolow. The film was shot entirely on location in Nepal starring Barry Sloane as Eric Blair.

==Fictionality==
The degree to which the story is fiction has been disputed. In his biography of Orwell, &quot;George Orwell: A Life&quot;, Bernard Crick cast doubt on the idea that Orwell himself actually shot an elephant. No independent account of Orwell&#x27;s actions has been found, and there was no official record of the incident, which was unusual because of the destruction of valuable property.

Peter Davison, the editor of Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Complete Works&quot;, includes an interview with George Stuart, a contemporary of Orwell in Burma, who said that Orwell was transferred to Kathar as punishment for shooting an elephant. &quot;An elephant was considered a valuable asset to any timber firm... and Orwell would have been severely reprimanded for such unnecessary slaughter. It was not long after the incident that he was transferred from Moulmein to a quiet post in Upper Burma called Katha&quot;. Davison also includes in the complete works a news item from the &quot;Rangoon Gazette&quot;, March 22, 1926, which describes a Major E. C. Kenny shooting an elephant in similar circumstances. When one biographer questioned Orwell&#x27;s wife, Sonia Brownell, she replied, &quot;Of course he shot a f--king a [sic] elephant. He said he did. Why do you always doubt his word!&quot;

<text>Daniel Libeskind (born May 12, 1946) is a Polish–American architect, artist, professor and set designer. Libeskind founded Studio Daniel Libeskind in 1989 with his wife, Nina, and is its principal design architect.

He is known for the design and completion of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, Germany, that opened in 2001. On February 27, 2003, Libeskind received further international attention after he won the competition to be the master plan architect for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan.

Other buildings that he is known for include the extension to the Denver Art Museum in the United States, the Grand Canal Theatre in Dublin, the Imperial War Museum North in Greater Manchester, England, the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada, the Felix Nussbaum Haus in Osnabrück, Germany, the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, Reflections in Singapore and the Wohl Centre at the Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel. His portfolio also includes several residential projects. Libeskind&#x27;s work has been exhibited in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Bauhaus Archives, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Centre Pompidou.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Łódź, Poland, Libeskind was the second child of Dora and Nachman Libeskind, both Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors. As a young child, Libeskind learned to play the accordion and quickly became a virtuoso, performing on Polish television in 1953. He won a America Israel Cultural Foundation scholarship in 1959 and played alongside a young Itzhak Perlman. Libeskind lived in Poland for 11 years and says &quot;I can still speak, read and write Polish.&quot;

In 1957, the Libeskinds moved to Kibbutz Gvat, Israel and then to Tel Aviv before moving to New York in 1959. In his autobiography, &quot;Breaking Ground: An Immigrant&#x27;s Journey from Poland to Ground Zero&quot;, Libeskind spoke of how the kibbutz experience influenced his concern for green architecture.

In the summer of 1959, his family moved to New York City on one of the last immigrant boats to the United States. In New York, Libeskind lived in the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative in the northwest Bronx, a union-sponsored, middle-income cooperative development. He attended the Bronx High School of Science. The print shop where his father worked was on Stone Street in Lower Manhattan, and he watched the original World Trade Center being built in the 1960s. Libeskind became a United States citizen in 1965.

Daniel Libeskind was accepted at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and began school there in 1965 where he was taught by John Hejduk and received his professional architectural degree in 1970. In 1968, Libeskind briefly worked as an apprentice to architect Richard Meier. He received a postgraduate degree in history and theory of architecture at the School of Comparative Studies at the University of Essex in 1972. The same year, he was hired to work at Peter Eisenman&#x27;s New York Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, but he quit almost immediately.

==Career==
Libeskind began his career as an architectural theorist and professor, holding positions at various institutions around the world. From 1978 to 1985, Libeskind was the director of the Architecture Department at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. His practical architectural career began in Milan in the late 1980s, where he submitted to architectural competitions and also founded and directed Architecture Intermundium, Institute for Architecture &amp; Urbanism. 

Libeskind completed his first building at the age of 52, with the opening of the Felix Nussbaum Haus in Osnabrück, Germany in 1998. Prior to this, critics had dismissed his designs as &quot;unbuildable or unduly assertive&quot;. In 1987, Libeskind won his first design competition for housing in West Berlin, but the Berlin Wall fell shortly thereafter and the project was cancelled. Libeskind won the first four project competitions he entered including the Jewish Museum Berlin in 1989, which became the first museum dedicated to the Holocaust in WWII and opened to the public in 2001 with international acclaim. This was his first major international success and was one of the first building modifications designed after reunification. A glass courtyard was designed by Libeskind and added in 2007. The Academy of the Jewish Museum Berlin also designed by Libeskind was completed in 2012.

Libeskind was selected by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to oversee the rebuilding of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks. The concept for the site, which he titled Memory Foundations, was well-received upon its presentation to the public in 2003, although it was ultimately changed significantly before its execution. He was the first architect to win the Hiroshima Art Prize, awarded to an artist whose work promotes international understanding and peace. Many of his projects look at the deep cultural connections between memory and architecture.

Studio Daniel Libeskind is headquartered two blocks south of the World Trade Center site in New York. He has designed numerous cultural and commercial institutions, museums, concert halls, convention centers, universities, residences, hotels, and shopping centers. The studio&#x27;s most recent completed projects include the MO Museum in Vilnius, Lithuania; Zlota 44, a high-rise residential tower in Warsaw, Poland; the Ogden Centre for Fundamental Physics at Durham University in Durham, England; the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa, Canada; and Corals at Keppel Bay in Singapore, adjacent to the studio&#x27;s previous completed project Reflections at Keppel Bay.

=== Design objects ===
In addition to his architectural projects, Libeskind has worked with a number of international design firms to develop objects, furniture, and industrial fixtures for interiors of buildings. He has been commissioned to work with design companies such as Fiam, Artemide, Jacuzzi, TreP-Tre-Piu, Oliviari, Sawaya &amp; Moroni, Poltrona Frau, Swarovski, and others.

=== Sculpture and installations ===
Libeskind&#x27;s design projects also include sculpture. Several sculptures built in the early 1990s were based on the explorations of his Micromegas and Chamberworks drawings series that he did in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Polderland Garden of Love and Fire in Almere, Netherlands is a permanent installation completed in 1997 and restored on October 4, 2017. Later in his career, Libeskind designed the Life Electric sculpture that was completed in 2015 on Lake Como, Italy. This sculpture is dedicated to the physicist Alessandro Volta.

=== Opera and verse ===
Libeskind has designed opera sets for productions such as the Norwegian National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;The Architect&quot; in 1998 and Saarländisches Staatstheater&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in 2001. He also designed the sets and costumes for &quot;Intolleranza&quot; by Luigi Nono and for a production of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Saint Francis of Assisi&quot; by Deutsche Oper Berlin. He has also written free verse prose, included in his book &quot;Fishing from the Pavement&quot;.

== Academia ==
Daniel Libeskind was the Head of Architecture at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan from 1978-1985. During his tenure at Cranbrook he explored various themes of space, influenced by theorists like Derrida and he was part of the leading avant-garde in architecture and academia. He produced several writings, artworks and large-scale explorations, including the Reading Machine, Writing Machine and Memory Machine. The machines called the &quot;Three Lessons in Architecture&quot; were displayed at the Venice Biennale in 1985 where Libeskind also won a Stone Lion award. Libeskind has taught at numerous universities across the world, including the University of Kentucky, Yale University, UCLA, Harvard, the University of London, and the University of Pennsylvania. He continues to teach students at various universities including the Catholic University of America.

==Criticism==

While much of Libeskind&#x27;s work has been well-received, it has also been the subject of often severe criticism. Critics often describe Libeskind&#x27;s work as deconstructivist. Critics charge that it reflects a limited architectural vocabulary of jagged edges, sharp angles and tortured geometries, that can fall into cliche, and that it ignores location and context. In 2008 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Christopher Hawthorne wrote: &quot;Anyone looking for signs that Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s work might deepen profoundly over time, or shift in some surprising direction, has mostly been doing so in vain.&quot; Nicolai Ouroussoff stated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2006: &quot;His worst buildings, like a 2002 war museum in England suggesting the shards of a fractured globe, can seem like a caricature of his own aesthetic.&quot; In the UK magazine &quot;Building Design&quot;, Owen Hatherley wrote of Libeskind&#x27;s students&#x27; union for London Metropolitan University: &quot;All of its vaulting, aggressive gestures were designed to &#x27;put London Met on the map&#x27;, and to give an image of fearless modernity with, however, little of consequence.&quot; William JR Curtis in &quot;Architectural Review&quot; called his Run Run Shaw Creative Media Centre &quot;a pile-up of Libeskindian clichés without sense, form or meaning&quot; and wrote that his Hyundai Development Corporation Headquarters delivered &quot;a trite and noisy corporate message&quot;.

In response, Libeskind says he ignores critics: &quot;How can I read them? I have more important things to read.&quot;

==Personal life==
Libeskind met Nina Lewis, his future wife and business partner, at the Bundist-run Camp Hemshekh in upstate New York in 1966. They married a few years later and, instead of a traditional honeymoon, traveled across the US visiting Frank Lloyd Wright buildings on a Cooper Union fellowship. Nina is co-founder for Studio Daniel Libeskind. She is the daughter of the late-Canadian political leader David Lewis and the sister of former Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations, Stephen Lewis.

Libeskind has lived, among other places, in New York City, Toronto, Michigan, Italy, Germany, and Los Angeles. He is both a U.S. and Israeli citizen.

Nina and Daniel Libeskind have three children: Lev, Noam, and Rachel.

<text>Seven ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Africa&quot;, after the continent of Africa. Two others were planned:
* was a 46-gun ship in service from 1694 to 1696.
* was a 64-gun third-rate launched in 1761 and sold in 1774.
* was a 64-gun third-rate launched in 1781. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar and was broken up in 1814.
* HMS &quot;Africa&quot; was a prison ship, launched in 1803 as the 36-gun fifth rate . She became a prison ship in 1826, was renamed HMS &quot;Africa&quot; in 1859 and was sold in 1860.
* was a wooden-hulled screw sloop launched in 1862 and sold to China later that year. She was renamed &quot;China&quot; and was sold in 1865.
* HMS &quot;Africa&quot; was to have been a &quot;Drake&quot;-class cruiser but she was renamed in 1899, before being launched in 1901.
* was a &quot;King Edward VII&quot;-class battleship launched in 1905 and sold in 1920.
* HMS &quot;Africa&quot; was to have been an &quot;Audacious&quot;-class aircraft carrier. She was ordered in 1943, but was later reordered as a &quot;Malta&quot;-class carrier, before being cancelled in 1945.
* There was also an Irish hired armed cutter &quot;Africa&quot;, of 70 tons burthen (bm), in Royal Navy service from 12 December 1803 to 12 January 1810.

<text>In evolutionary ecology, a parasitoid is an organism that lives in close association with its host at the host&#x27;s expense, eventually resulting in the death of the host. Parasitoidism is one of six major evolutionary strategies within parasitism, distinguished by the fatal prognosis for the host, which makes the strategy close to predation.

Among parasitoids, strategies range from living inside the host (&quot;endoparasitism&quot;), allowing it to continue growing before emerging as an adult, to paralysing the host and living outside it (&quot;ectoparasitism&quot;). Hosts can include other parasitoids, resulting in hyperparasitism; in the case of oak galls, up to five levels of parasitism are possible. Some parasitoids influence their host&#x27;s behaviour in ways that favour the propagation of the parasitoid.

Parasitoids are found in a variety of taxa across the insect superorder Endopterygota, whose complete metamorphosis may have pre-adapted them for a split lifestyle, with parasitoid larvae and free-living adults. Most are in the Hymenoptera, where the ichneumons and many other parasitoid wasps are highly specialised for a parasitoidal way of life. There are parasitoids, too, in the Diptera, Coleoptera and other orders of endopterygote insects. Some of these, usually but not only wasps, are used in biological pest control. 

The 17th-century zoological artist Maria Sibylla Merian closely observed parasitoids and their hosts in her paintings. The biology of parasitoidism influenced Charles Darwin&#x27;s beliefs and has inspired science fiction authors and scriptwriters to create numerous parasitoidal aliens that kill their human hosts, such as the alien species in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;parasitoid&quot; was coined in 1913 by the Swedo-Finnish writer Odo Reuter, and adopted in English by his reviewer, the entomologist William Morton Wheeler. Reuter used it to describe the strategy where the parasite develops in or on the body of a single host individual, eventually killing that host, while the adult is free-living. Since that time, the concept has been generalised and widely applied.

==Strategies==

===Evolutionary options===

A perspective on the evolutionary options can be gained by considering four questions: the effect on the reproductive fitness of a parasite&#x27;s hosts; the number of hosts they have per life stage; whether the host is prevented from reproducing; and whether the effect depends on intensity (number of parasites per host). From this analysis, proposed by K. D. Lafferty and A. M. Kunis, the major evolutionary strategies of parasitism emerge, alongside predation.

Parasitoidism, in the view of R. Poulin and H. S. Randhawa, is one of six main evolutionary strategies within parasitism, the others being parasitic castrator, directly transmitted parasite, transmitted parasite, vector-transmitted parasite, and micropredator. These are adaptive peaks, with many possible intermediate strategies, but organisms in many different groups have consistently converged on these six.

Parasitoids feed on a living host which they eventually kill, typically before it can produce offspring, whereas conventional parasites usually do not kill their hosts, and predators typically kill their prey immediately.

===Basic concepts===
Parasitoids can be classified as either endo- or ectoparasitoids with idiobiont or koinobiont developmental strategies. Endoparasitoids live within their host&#x27;s body, while ectoparasitoids feed on the host from outside. Idiobiont parasitoids prevent further development of the host after initially immobilising it, whereas koinobiont parasitoids allow the host to continue its development while feeding upon it. Most ectoparasitoids are idiobiont, as the host could damage or dislodge the external parasitoid if allowed to move and moult. Most endoparasitoids are koinobionts, giving them the advantage of a host that continues to grow larger and avoid predators.

Primary parasitoids have the simplest parasitic relationship, involving two organisms, the host and the parasitoid. Hyperparasitoids are parasitoids of parasitoids; secondary parasitoids have a primary parasitoid as their host, so there are three organisms involved. Hyperparasitoids are either facultative (can be a primary parasitoid or a hyperparasitoid depending on the situation) or obligate (always develop as a hyperparasitoid). Levels of parasitoids beyond secondary also occur, especially among facultative parasitoids. In oak gall systems, there can be up to five levels of parasitism. Cases in which two or more species of parasitoids simultaneously attack the same host without parasitizing each other are called multi- or multiple parasitism. In many cases, multiple parasitism still leads to the death of one or more of the parasitoids involved. If multiple parasitoids of the same species coexist in a single host, it is called superparasitism. Gregarious species lay multiple eggs or polyembryonic eggs which lead to multiple larvae in a single host. The end result of gregarious superparasitism can be a single surviving parasitoid individual or multiple surviving individuals, depending on the species. If superparasitism occurs accidentally in normally solitary species the larvae often fight among themselves until only one is left.

===Influencing host behaviour===

In another strategy, some parasitoids influence the host&#x27;s behaviour in ways that favour the propagation of the parasitoid, often at the cost of the host&#x27;s life. A spectacular example is the lancet liver fluke, which causes host ants to die clinging to grass stalks, where grazers or birds may be expected to eat them and complete the parasitoidal fluke&#x27;s life cycle in its definitive host. Similarly, as strepsipteran parasitoids of ants mature, they cause the hosts to climb high on grass stalks, positions that are risky, but favour the emergence of the strepsipterans. Among pathogens of mammals, the rabies virus affects the host&#x27;s central nervous system, eventually killing it, but perhaps helping to disseminate the virus by modifying the host&#x27;s behaviour. Among the parasitic wasps, &quot;Glyptapanteles&quot; modifies the behaviour of its host caterpillar to defend the pupae of the wasps after they emerge from the caterpillar&#x27;s body. The phorid fly &quot;Apocephalus borealis&quot; oviposits into the abdomen of its hosts, including honey bees, causing them to abandon their nest, flying from it at night and soon dying, allowing the next generation of flies to emerge outside the hive.

==Taxonomic range==

About 10% of described insects are parasitoids, in the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Lepidoptera, Strepsiptera, and Trichoptera. The majority are wasps within the Hymenoptera; most of the others are Dipteran flies. Parasitoidism has evolved independently many times: once each in Hymenoptera, Strepsiptera, Neuroptera, and Trichoptera, twice in the Lepidoptera, 10 times or more in Coleoptera, and no less than 21 times among the Diptera. These are all holometabolous insects (Endopterygota, which form a single clade), and it is always the larvae that are parasitoidal. The metamorphosis from active larva to an adult with a different body structure permits the dual lifestyle of parasitic larva, freeliving adult in this group. These relationships are shown on the phylogenetic tree; groups containing parasitoids are shown in boldface, e.g. Coleoptera, with the number of times parasitoidism evolved in the group in parentheses, e.g. (10 clades). The approximate number (estimates can vary widely) of parasitoid species out of the total is shown in square brackets, e.g. [2,500 of 400,000].
===Hymenoptera===

Within the Hymenoptera, parasitoidism evolved just once, and the many described species of parasitoid wasps represent the great majority of species in the order, barring those like the ants, bees, and Vespidae wasps that have secondarily lost the parasitoid habit. The parasitoid wasps include some 25,000 Ichneumonoidea, 22,000 Chalcidoidea, 5,500 Vespoidea, 4,000 Platygastroidea, 3,000 Chrysidoidea, 2,300 Cynipoidea, and many smaller families. These often have remarkable life cycles.
They can be classified as either endoparasitic or ectoparasitic according to where they lay their eggs. Endoparasitic wasps insert their eggs inside their host, usually as koinobionts, allowing the host to continue to grow (thus providing more food to the wasp larvae), moult, and evade predators. Ectoparasitic wasps deposit theirs outside the host&#x27;s body, usually as idiobionts, immediately paralysing the host to prevent it from escaping or throwing off the parasite. They often carry the host to a nest where it will remain undisturbed for the wasp larva to feed on. Most species of wasps attack the eggs or larvae of their host, but some attack adults. Oviposition depends on finding the host and on evading host defences; the ovipositor is a tube-like organ used to inject eggs into hosts, sometimes much longer than the wasp&#x27;s body. Hosts such as ants often behave as if aware of the wasps&#x27; presence, making violent movements to prevent oviposition. Wasps may wait for the host to stop moving, and then attack suddenly.

Parasitoid wasps face a range of obstacles to oviposition, including behavioural, morphological, physiological and immunological defences of their hosts. To thwart this, some wasps inundate their host with their eggs so as to overload its immune system&#x27;s ability to encapsulate foreign bodies; others introduce a virus which interferes with the host&#x27;s immune system.
Some parasitoid wasps locate hosts by detecting the chemicals that plants release to defend against insect herbivores.

===Other orders===
The true flies (Diptera) include several families of parasitoids, the largest of which is the Tachinidae (some 9,200 species), followed by the Bombyliidae (some 4,500 species), along with the Pipunculidae and the Conopidae, which includes parasitoidal genera such as &quot;Stylogaster&quot;. Other families of flies include some protelean species. Some Phoridae are parasitoids of ants. Some flesh flies are parasitoids: for instance &quot;Emblemasoma auditrix&quot; is parasitoidal on cicadas, locating its host by sound.

The Strepsiptera (twisted-wing parasites) consist entirely of parasitoids; they usually sterilise their hosts.

Two beetle families, Ripiphoridae (450 species) and Rhipiceridae, are largely parasitoids, as are &quot;Aleochara&quot; Staphylinidae; in all, some 400 staphylinids are parasitoidal. Some 1,600 species of the large and mainly freeliving family Carabidae are parasitoids.

A few Neuroptera are parasitoidal; they have larvae that actively search for hosts. The larvae of some Mantispidae, subfamily Symphrasinae, are parasitoids of other arthropods including bees and wasps.

Although nearly all Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are herbivorous, a few species are parasitic. The larvae of Epipyropidae feed on Homoptera such as leafhoppers and cicadas, and sometimes on other Lepidoptera. The larvae of Cyclotornidae parasitise first Homoptera and later ant brood. The pyralid moth &quot;Chalcoela&quot; has been used in biological control of the wasp &quot;Polistes&quot; in the Galapagos Islands.

Parasitism is rare in the Trichoptera (caddisflies), but it is found among the Hydroptilidae (purse-case caddisflies), probably including all 10 species in the &quot;Orthotrichia aberrans&quot; group; they parasitise the pupae of other trichopterans.

Mites of the family Acarophenacidae are ectoparasitoids of insect eggs. Unlike the insect parasitoids, it is the adult stage in Acarophenacidae that acts as a parasitoid. Specifically, adult female mites feed on insect eggs and their body swells up with offspring, which eventually emerge as adults.

=== Entomopathogenic fungi ===
All known fungi in the genera &quot;Cordyceps&quot; and &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; are endoparasitic. One of the most notable fungal parasitoids is &quot;O. unilateralis&quot; which infects carpenter ants by breaching the ant&#x27;s exoskeletons via their spores and growing in the ant&#x27;s hemocoel as free living yeast cells. Eventually the yeast cells progress to producing nerve toxins to alter the behaviour of the ant causing it to climb and bite onto vegetation, known as the &#x27;death bite&#x27;. This approach is so fine-tuned it causes the ant to bite down on the adaxial leaf midrib, which is the part of the leaf most optimal for the fungus to fruit. In fact, it has been found that in specific circumstances, the time of the death bite is synchronised to solar noon. As much as 40% of the ant&#x27;s biomass is fungal hyphae at the moment of the death bite. After the ant dies, the fungus produces a large stalk, growing from the back of the ant&#x27;s head which subsequently releases ascospores. These spores are too large to be wind dispersed and instead fall directly to the ground where they produce secondary spores that infect ants as they walk over them. &quot;O. sinesis&quot;, is a parasitoid as well, parasitising ghost moth larvae, killing them within 15-25 days, a similar process to that of &quot;O. unilateralis&quot;.

== Learning in parasitoids ==
Host location has been studied in &quot;Ormia ochracea,&quot; a parasitoid tachinid fly that locates their field cricket host acoustically (phonotaxis). Preference for the dominant local host species was not explained by DNA analysis. In fact, populations across the southern U.S. were inexplicably closely related, considering rate of range expansion from a presumed Central American origin. A captive population of lab-reared flies were raised on two different host songs (&quot;Gryllus integer&quot; or &quot;G. lineaticeps&quot;). Responsive adult females overwhelmingly chose their familiar song, indicating the use of a learned, auditory search image. This phenotypic plasticity allows such a highly specialized parasitoid to avoid overspecialization disasters. Interestingly, when receptive females only heard silence the night before testing for preference, they chose the host songs equally, 50/50. This capacity for learning and use of search images paired with a highly specialized morphology and lifestyle (eg. tympana tuned to host sound cues, larviparous) supports the extraordinarily fast range expansion of &quot;O. ochracea,&quot; as well as the presence and power of learning in parasitoids.

== Interactions with humans ==

=== In biological pest control ===

Parasitoids are among the most widely used biological control agents. Classic biological pest control using natural enemies of pests (parasitoids or predators) is extremely cost effective, the cost/benefit ratio for classic control being 1:250, but the technique is more variable in its effects than pesticides; it reduces rather than eliminates pests. The cost/benefit ratio for screening natural enemies is similarly far higher than for screening chemicals: 1:30 against 1:5 respectively, since the search for suitable natural enemies can be guided accurately with ecological knowledge. Natural enemies are more difficult to produce and to distribute than chemicals, as they have a shelf life of weeks at most; and they face a commercial obstacle, namely that they cannot be patented.

From the point of view of the farmer or horticulturalist, the most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which prey mainly on caterpillars of butterflies and moths; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including greenfly; chalcidoid wasps, which parasitise eggs and larvae of greenfly, whitefly, cabbage caterpillars, and scale insects; and tachinid flies, which parasitise a wide range of insects including caterpillars, adult and larval beetles, and true bugs. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term seasonal daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term year-round low daily output with a range in production of 4–1000 million female parasitoids per week, to meet demand for suitable biological control agents for different crops.&#x27;

=== Maria Sibylla Merian ===
Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717) was one of the first naturalists to study and depict parasitoids and their insect hosts in her closely-observed paintings.

=== Charles Darwin ===

Parasitoids influenced the religious thinking of Charles Darwin, who wrote in an 1860 letter to the American naturalist Asa Gray: &quot;I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars.&quot; The palaeontologist Donald Prothero notes that religiously minded people of the Victorian era, including Darwin, were horrified by this instance of evident cruelty in nature, particularly noticeable in the ichneumonid wasps.

===In science fiction===


Parasitoids have inspired science fiction authors and screenwriters to create terrifying parasitic alien species that kill their human hosts. One of the best-known is the Xenomorph in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;, which runs rapidly through its lifecycle from violently entering a human host&#x27;s mouth to bursting fatally from the host&#x27;s chest. The molecular biologist Alex Sercel, writing in &quot;Signal to Noise Magazine&quot;, compares &quot;the biology of the [&quot;Alien&quot;] Xenomorphs to parasitoid wasps and nematomorph worms from Earth to illustrate how close to reality the biology of these aliens is and to discuss this exceptional instance of science inspiring artists&quot;. Sercel notes that the way the Xenomorph grasps a human&#x27;s face to implant its embryo is comparable to the way a parasitoid wasp lays its eggs in a living host. He further compares the Xenomorph life cycle to that of the nematomorph &quot;Paragordius tricuspidatus&quot; which grows to fill its host&#x27;s body cavity before bursting out and killing it. Alistair Dove, on the science website &quot;Deep Sea News&quot;, writes that there are multiple parallels with parasitoids, although in his view, there are more disturbing life cycles in real biology. Dove stated that the parallels include the placing of an embryo in the host; its growth in the host; the resulting death of the host; and alternating generations, as in the Digenea (trematodes). The social anthropologist Marika Moisseeff argues that &quot;The parasitical and swarming aspects of insect reproduction make these animals favoured villains in Hollywood science fiction. The battle of culture against nature is depicted as an unending combat between humanity and insect-like extraterrestrial species that tend to parasitise human beings in order to reproduce.&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; lists many instances of &quot;parasitism&quot;, often causing the host&#x27;s death.

<text>is a prefecture of Japan located on the island of Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands. Kagoshima Prefecture has a population of 1,564,175 (1 September 2022) and has a geographic area of 9,187 km2 (3,547 sq mi). Kagoshima Prefecture borders Kumamoto Prefecture to the north and Miyazaki Prefecture to the northeast.

Kagoshima is the capital and largest city of Kagoshima Prefecture, with other major cities including Kirishima, Kanoya, and Satsumasendai. Kagoshima Prefecture is located at the southernmost point of Kyūshū and includes the Satsunan Islands group of the Ryukyu Islands. Kagoshima Prefecture&#x27;s mainland territory extends from the Ariake Sea to Shibushi Bay on the Pacific Ocean coast, and is characterized by two large peninsulas created by Kagoshima Bay. Kagoshima Prefecture formed the core of the Satsuma Domain, ruled from Kagoshima Castle, one of the most important Japanese domains of the Edo period and the Meiji Restoration.

== History ==

Kagoshima Prefecture corresponds to the ancient Japanese provinces Ōsumi and Satsuma, including the northern part of the Ryukyu Islands (&quot;Satsunan&quot;). This region played a key role in the Meiji Restoration (Saigō Takamori), and the city of Kagoshima was an important naval base during Japan&#x27;s 20th century wars and the home of admiral Tōgō Heihachirō.
More recent incidents are the sinking of a North Korean spy ship (100 ton class) in 2001 by the Coast Guard, which was later salvaged and exhibited in Tokyo, and the abduction of an office clerk from a Kagoshima beach in 1978 by agents from the same country. This became known only recently under the Koizumi administration.

== Demographics ==
The two main ethnic groups of Kagoshima Prefecture are the Japanese and the Ryukyuans (Amami Islands).

== Geography ==
Kagoshima Prefecture is located at the southwest tip of Kyushu on the Satsuma Peninsula and Ōsumi Peninsula. This prefecture also includes a chain of islands stretching further to the southwest of Kyushu for a few hundred kilometers. The most important group is the Amami Islands. Surrounded by the East China Sea to the west, Okinawa Prefecture in the south, Kumamoto Prefecture to the north, and Miyazaki Prefecture to the east, it has of coastline (including the 28 islands). It has a bay called Kagoshima Bay (Kinkowan), which is sandwiched by two peninsulas, Satsuma and Ōsumi. Its position made it a &#x27;gateway&#x27; to Japan at various times in history. While Kyushu has about 13 million people, there are less than 2 million in this prefecture.

The prefecture boasts a chain of active and dormant volcanoes, including the great Sakurajima, which towers out of the Kagoshima bay opposite Kagoshima city. A steady trickle of smoke and ash emerges from the caldera, punctuated by louder mini-eruptions on an almost daily basis. On active days in Kagoshima city an umbrella is advisable to ward off the ash. Sakurajima is one of Japan&#x27;s most active volcanoes. Major eruptions occurred in 1914, when the island mountain spilled enough material to become permanently connected to the mainland, and a lesser eruption in 1960. Volcanic materials in the soil make Sakurajima a source for record daikon radishes, roughly the size of a basketball. Many beaches around the Kagoshima Bay are littered with well-worn pumice stones. A crater lake in the southwestern tip of the prefecture, near the spa town of Ibusuki, is home to a rare species of giant eel.

As of 31 March 2019, 13% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Amami Guntō, Kirishima-Kinkowan, Unzen-Amakusa, and Yakushima National Parks; Koshikishima and Nichinan Kaigan Quasi-National Parks; and Akune, Bōnoma, Fukiagehama, Imutaike, Ōsumi Nanbu, Sendaigawa Ryūiki, Takakumayama, and Tokara Rettō Prefectural Natural Parks.
==Economy==
Most of the economic sector is focused in Kagoshima City and the surrounding area, corresponding to the extent of the former Satsuma Province. The eastern part of the prefecture, the former Ōsumi Province, is mostly rural and shows a general population decline.

The prefecture has strong agricultural roots, which are reflected in its most well-known exports: green tea, sweet potato, radish, Pongee rice, Satsuma ware, Berkshire pork (&quot;kurobuta&quot;) and local Black Wagyu beef. Kagoshima prefecture&#x27;s production of bonito flakes is second only to that of Shizuoka. In addition, it produces Japan&#x27;s largest volume of unagi eels. Kagoshima is also largest beef and pork producing prefecture in Japan.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has several facilities within the prefecture, including the country&#x27;s main launch facility on Tanegashima and the Uchinoura Space Center.

The prefecture&#x27;s gross domestic product is approximately 5,548.7 trillion yen, with a work force of about 791,000 people (2018)

<text>Eminent Victorians is a book by Lytton Strachey (one of the older members of the Bloomsbury Group), first published in 1918, and consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the Victorian era. Its fame rests on the irreverence and wit Strachey brought to bear on three men and a woman who had, until then, been regarded as heroes: Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Thomas Arnold and General Charles Gordon. While Nightingale is actually praised and her reputation enhanced, the book shows its other subjects in a less-than-flattering light, for instance, the intrigues of Cardinal Manning against Cardinal Newman.

The book made Strachey&#x27;s name and placed him firmly in the top rank of biographers.

==Background==
Strachey developed the idea for &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; in 1912, when he was living on occasional journalism and writing dilettante plays and verse for his Bloomsbury friends. He went to live in the country at East Ilsley and started work on a book then called &quot;Victorian Silhouettes&quot;, containing miniature biographies of a dozen notable Victorian personalities. In November 1912, he wrote to Virginia Woolf that their Victorian predecessors &quot;seem to me a set of mouth bungled hypocrites&quot;. After his research into the life of Cardinal Manning, he realised he would have difficulty managing twelve lives. In the following year he moved to Wiltshire, where he stayed until 1915, by which time he had completed half the book. One of the subjects he considered but rejected was Isabella Beeton. He chose not to write about her because he could not find sufficient relevant material.

By then it was wartime, and Strachey&#x27;s anti-war and anti-conscription activities were taking up his time. He hardened his views and concluded that the Victorian worthies had not just been hypocrites, but that they had bequeathed to his generation the &quot;profoundly evil&quot; system, &quot;by which it is sought to settle international disputes by force&quot;.

By 1917, the work was ready for publication and Strachey was put in touch with Geoffrey Whitworth at Chatto &amp; Windus. The critic Frank Arthur Swinnerton was taken with the work and it was published on 9 May 1918, with almost uniformly enthusiastic reviews.

==Summary==
Each of the lives is very different from the others, although there are common threads, for example, the recurrent appearance of William Ewart Gladstone and Arthur Hugh Clough. Each story is set against a specific background.

In Cardinal Manning&#x27;s story, the background is the creation of the Oxford Movement and the defection of an influential group of Church of England clergy to the Catholic Church. That is covered in depth to explain the Movement and its main protagonists, particularly Manning&#x27;s hostile relationship with John Henry Newman. Strachey is critical of Manning&#x27;s underhand manipulations in attempting to prevent Newman being made a Cardinal.

The background features of Florence Nightingale&#x27;s story are the machinations of the War Office, and the obtuseness of the military and politicians. Influenced by Sigmund Freud, Strachey depicts Florence Nightingale as an intense, driven woman who is both personally intolerable and admirable in her achievements.

Dr Arnold is hailed as an exemplar who established the Public School system. Strachey describes that as an education based on chapel and the classics, with a prefectorial system to maintain order. He points out that it was not Arnold who was responsible for the obsession with sport, but does make it clear that Arnold was at fault in ignoring the sciences. Although Arnold was revered at the time, Strachey sees his approach as very damaging in retrospect. Strachey also mocks Arnold&#x27;s efforts at moral improvement of the general public, for example his unsuccessful weekly newspaper.

The story of Gordon is that of a maverick soldier and adventurer, whose original military achievements in China would have been forgotten. He was a mercenary who got into and out of conflicts on behalf of various dubious governments, but much of his experience was in the Sudan. The final disaster was when the Egyptian occupation of Sudan was almost completely overthrown by fundamentalist rebels, and someone was needed to retrieve the situation in Khartoum. The job fell to Gordon, whose instincts were to do anything but withdraw, and he became embroiled in a siege. The British government was put in an almost impossible dilemma, and when eventually they did send a relief expedition it arrived just two days too late. Strachey based Gordon’s story on his diaries and letters to give an account of a strong individual almost at odds with the world.

==Critical reception==
On 21 May 1918, Bertrand Russell wrote to Gladys Rinder from Brixton Prison, in which he was imprisoned for his anti-war campaigning:
It is brilliant, delicious, exquisitely civilized. I enjoyed as much as any the Gordon, which alone was quite new to me. I often laughed out loud in my cell while I was reading the book. The warder came to my cell to remind me that prison was a place of punishment.

The American critic Edmund Wilson wrote in the &quot;New Republic&quot; of 21 September 1932, not long after Strachey&#x27;s death: &quot;Lytton Strachey&#x27;s chief mission, of course, was to take down once and for all the pretensions of the Victorian age to moral superiority ... neither the Americans nor the English have ever, since &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; appeared, been able to feel quite the same about the legends that had dominated their pasts. Something had been punctured for good.&quot;

==Significance==
With the publication of &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;, Lytton Strachey set out to breathe life into the Victorian era for future generations to read. Up until that point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been &quot;as familiar as the &quot;cortège&quot; of the undertaker, and wear the same air of slow, funereal barbarism.&quot; Strachey defied the tradition of &quot;two fat volumes ... of undigested masses of material&quot;, and took aim at the four venerated figures.

British Labour politician Roy Hattersley wrote: &quot;Lytton Strachey&#x27;s elegant, energetic character assassinations destroyed for ever the pretensions of the Victorian age to moral supremacy.&quot;.

<text>The Federal Republic of Germany is a federation and consists of sixteen partly sovereign states. Of the sixteen states, thirteen are so-called area-states (&#x27;Flächenländer&#x27;); in these, below the level of the state government, there is a division into local authorities (counties and county-level cities) that have their own administration. Two states, Berlin and Hamburg, are city-states, in which there is no separation between state government and local administration. The state of Bremen is a special case: the state consists of the cities of Bremen, for which the state government also serves as the municipal administration, and Bremerhaven, which has its own local administration separate from the state government. It is therefore a mixture of a city-state and an area-state.
Three states, Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia, use the appellation (&quot;free state&quot;); this title is merely stylistic and carries no legal or political significance (similar to the US states that call themselves a commonwealth).

The Federal Republic of Germany (&quot;West Germany&quot;) was created in 1949 through the unification of the three western zones previously under American, British, and French administration in the aftermath of World War II. Initially, the states of the Federal Republic were Baden (until 1952), Bavaria (in German: ), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (), Lower Saxony (), North Rhine-Westphalia (), Rhineland-Palatinate (), Schleswig-Holstein, Württemberg-Baden (until 1952), and Württemberg-Hohenzollern (until 1952). West Berlin, while still under occupation by the Western Allies, viewed itself as part of the Federal Republic and was largely integrated and considered a &quot;de facto&quot; state. In 1952, following a referendum, Baden, Württemberg-Baden, and Württemberg-Hohenzollern merged into Baden-Württemberg. In 1957, the Saar Protectorate joined the Federal Republic as the state of Saarland.

The next change occurred with German reunification in 1990, in which the territory of the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) became part of the Federal Republic, by accession of the re-established eastern states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (), Saxony (), Saxony-Anhalt (), and Thuringia (), and the reunification of West and East Berlin into a city state. A referendum in 1996 to merge Berlin with surrounding Brandenburg failed to reach the necessary majority vote in Brandenburg, while a majority of Berliners voted in favour.

==States==
It was the states that formed the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. This was in contrast to the post-war development in Austria, where the national &quot;Bund&quot; (&quot;federation&quot;) was constituted first, and then the individual states were carved out as units of that federal nation.

The German use of the term &quot;Länder&quot; (&quot;lands&quot;) dates back to the Weimar Constitution of 1919. Previously, the states of the German Empire had been called &quot;Staaten&quot; (&quot;states&quot;). Today, it is very common to use the term &quot;Bundesland&quot; (federated &quot;Land&quot;). Officially this term &quot;Bundesland&quot; neither appears in the constitution of 1919 nor in the current one. Three &quot;Länder&quot; call themselves &quot;Freistaaten&quot; (&quot;free states&quot;, an older German term for &quot;republic&quot;): Bavaria (since 1919), Saxony (originally from 1919 and again since 1990), and Thuringia (since 1994). Of the 17 states at the end of the Weimar Republic, six still exist (though partly with different borders):
* Bavaria (The geographically distinct Palatinate, which was part of Bavaria, 1816–1946, is now part of Rheinland Pfalz).
* Bremen
* Hamburg
* Hesse 
* Saxony
* Thuringia

The other 11 states of the Weimar Republic either merged into one another or were separated into smaller entities:
* Anhalt is now part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt.
* Baden is now part of Baden-Württemberg.
* Braunschweig is now part of Lower Saxony.
* Lippe is now part of North Rhine-Westphalia.
* Lübeck is now part of Schleswig-Holstein.
* Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz are now parts of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
* Oldenburg is now part of Lower Saxony, with its former exclaves now belonging to their neighbouring states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein.
* Prussia was divided among the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein. The erstwhile Prussian provinces of Brandenburg, Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and Hanover formed the core of the states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony, respectively. The Prussian provinces of Westphalia and Rhineland contributed most territory to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Rhineland province contributed about half of the territory of the state of Rhineland Palatinate. Most of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau was merged with the existing state of Hesse. Some territories bordering other states were annexed to the bordering state. Also, Prussia had exclaves that were surrounded by other states. These became part of their surrounding states. All states, except Bavaria, now have territory of the former Free State of Prussia. Other former Prussian territories lying east of the rivers Neisse and Oder were lost in 1945 and are now part of Poland or Russia. They are Silesia (Upper and Lower), Pomerania, West Prussia-Posen, and East Prussia respectively. 
* Schaumburg-Lippe is now part of Lower Saxony.
* Württemberg is now part of Baden-Württemberg.

Possible boundary changes between states continue to be debated in Germany, in contrast to how there are &quot;significant differences among the American states and regional governments in other federations without serious calls for territorial changes&quot; in those other countries. Arthur B. Gunlicks summarizes the main arguments for boundary reform in Germany: &quot;the German system of dual federalism requires strong &quot;Länder&quot; that have the administrative and fiscal capacity to implement legislation and pay for it from own source revenues. Too many &quot;Länder&quot; also make coordination among them and with the federation more complicated.&quot; But several proposals have failed so far; territorial reform remains a controversial topic in German politics and public perception.

===List===

==History==

Federalism has a long tradition in German history. The Holy Roman Empire comprised many petty states, numbering more than 300 in around 1796. The number of territories was greatly reduced during the Napoleonic Wars (1796–1814). After the Congress of Vienna (1815), 39 states formed the German Confederation. The Confederation was dissolved after the Austro-Prussian War in which Prussia defeated Austria and forced Austria to remove itself from the affairs of the German states.

Territorial boundaries were essentially redrawn as a result of military conflicts and interventions from the outside: from the Napoleonic Wars to the Congress of Vienna, the number of territories decreased from about 300 to 39; in 1866 Prussia annexed the sovereign states of Hanover, Nassau, Hesse-Kassel, and the Free City of Frankfurt. Prussia and the other states in Northern and Central Germany united as a federal state, the North German Federation, on 1 July 1867. Four of the five southern German states (Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt) entered military alliances with Prussia but Austria did not. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, those four states joined the North German Federation which was consequently renamed to German Empire. The parliament and Federal Council decided to give the Prussian king the title of German Emperor (since 1 January 1871). The new German Empire included 25 states (three of them, Hanseatic cities) and the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine. Within the empire, 65% of the territory and 62% of the population belonged to the state of Prussia.

After the territorial losses of the Treaty of Versailles, the remaining states continued as republics of a new German federation. The debate on a new delimitation of the German territory started in 1919 as part of discussions about the new constitution. Hugo Preuss, the father of the Weimar Constitution, drafted a plan to divide the German Reich into 14 roughly equal-sized states. His proposal was turned down due to opposition of the states and concerns of the government. Article 18 of the constitution enabled a new delimitation of the German territory but set high hurdles: &quot;Three fifth of the votes handed in, and at least the majority of the population are necessary to decide on the alteration of territory&quot;. In fact, until 1933 there were only four changes in the configuration of the German states: the 7 Thuringian states were merged in 1920, whereby Coburg opted for Bavaria, Pyrmont joined Prussia in 1922, and Waldeck did so in 1929. Any later plans to break up the dominating Prussia into smaller states failed because political circumstances were not favourable to state reforms.

After the Nazi Party seized power in January 1933, the were gradually abolished and reduced to provinces under the Nazi regime via the process, as the states administratively were largely superseded by the Nazi &quot;Gau&quot; system. Three changes are of particular note: on 1 January 1934, Mecklenburg-Schwerin was united with neighbouring Mecklenburg-Strelitz; and, by the Greater Hamburg Act () of 1937, the territory of the city-state was extended, while Lübeck lost its independence and became part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein.

===West Germany, 1945–1990===

During the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, internal borders were redrawn by the Allied military governments. New states were established in all four zones of occupation: Bremen, Hesse, Württemberg-Baden, and Bavaria in the American zone; Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia in the British zone; Rhineland-Palatinate, Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern and the Saarland which later received a special status in the French zone; Mecklenburg(-Vorpommern), Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia in the Soviet zone. No single state comprised more than 30% of either population or territory; this was intended to prevent any one state from being as dominant within Germany as Prussia had been in the past. Initially, only seven of the pre-War states remained: Baden (in part), Bavaria (reduced in size), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (enlarged), Saxony, and Thuringia. The states with hyphenated names, such as Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony-Anhalt, owed their existence to the occupation powers and were created out of mergers of former Prussian provinces and smaller states.

Former German territory that lay east of the Oder-Neisse line fell under either Polish or Soviet administration but attempts were made at least symbolically not to abandon sovereignty well into the 1960s. The former provinces of Farther Pomerania, East Prussia, Silesia and Posen-West Prussia fell under Polish administration with the Soviet Union taking the area around Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place. More than 8 million Germans had been expelled from these territories that had formed part of the German-speaking lands for centuries and which mostly did not have sizable Polish minorities before 1945. However, no attempts were made to establish new states in these territories, as they lay outside the jurisdiction of West Germany at that time.

In 1948, the military governors of the three Western Allies handed over the so-called Frankfurt Documents to the minister-presidents in the Western occupation zones. Among other things, they recommended revising the boundaries of the West German states in a way that none of them should be too large or too small in comparison with the others.

As the premiers did not come to an agreement on this question, the Parliamentary Council was supposed to address this issue. Its provisions are reflected in Article 29 of the Basic Law. There was a binding provision for a new delimitation of the federal territory: the Federal Territory must be revised (paragraph 1). Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a had changed after 8 May 1945 without a referendum, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2). If at least one tenth of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections were in favour of a revision, the federal government had to include the proposal into its legislation. Then a referendum was required in each territory or part of a territory whose affiliation was to be changed (paragraph 3). The proposal should not take effect if within any of the affected territories a majority rejected the change. In this case, the bill had to be introduced again and after passing had to be confirmed by referendum in the Federal Republic as a whole (paragraph 4). The reorganization should be completed within three years after the Basic Law had come into force (paragraph 6). Article 29 states that &quot;the division of the federal territory into Länder may be revised to ensure that each be of a size and capacity to perform its functions effectively&quot;.

In their letter to Konrad Adenauer, the three western military governors approved the Basic Law but suspended Article 29 until such time as a peace treaty should be concluded. Only the special arrangement for the southwest under Article 118 could enter into force.

Upon its founding in 1949, West Germany thus had eleven states. These were reduced to nine in 1952 when three south-western states (South Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern, and Württemberg-Baden) merged to form Baden-Württemberg. From 1957, when the French-occupied Saar Protectorate was returned and formed into the Saarland, the Federal Republic consisted of ten states, which are referred to as the &quot;Old States&quot; today. West Berlin was under the sovereignty of the Western Allies and neither a Western German state nor part of one. However, it was in many ways integrated with West Germany under a special status.

A new delimitation of the federal territory has been discussed since the Federal Republic was founded in 1949 and even before. Committees and expert commissions advocated a reduction of the number of states; academics (Werner Rutz, Meinhard Miegel, Adrian Ottnad, etc.) and politicians (Walter Döring, Hans Apel, and others) made proposals some of them far-reaching for redrawing boundaries but hardly anything came of these public discussions. Territorial reform is sometimes propagated by the richer states as a means to avoid or reduce fiscal transfers.

====Establishment of Baden-Württemberg====

In southwestern Germany, territorial revision seemed to be a top priority since the border between the French and American occupation zones was set along the Autobahn Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Ulm (today the A8). Article 118 stated &quot;The division of the territory comprising Baden, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern into may be revised, without regard to the provisions of Article 29, by agreement between the concerned. If no agreement is reached, the revision shall be effected by a federal law, which shall provide for an advisory referendum.&quot; Since no agreement was reached, a referendum was held on 9 December 1951 in four different voting districts, three of which approved the merger (South Baden refused but was overruled, as the result of total votes was decisive). On 25 April 1952, the three former states merged to form Baden-Württemberg.

====Petitions to reconstitute former states ====
With the Paris Agreements in 1954, West Germany regained (limited) sovereignty. This triggered the start of the one-year period as set in paragraph 2 of Article 29. As a consequence, eight petitions for referendums were launched, six of which were successful:
* Reconstitution of the Free State of Oldenburg 12.9%
* Reconstitution of the Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe 15.3%
* Integration of Koblenz and Trier into North Rhine-Westphalia 14.2%
* Reintegration of Rheinhessen into Hesse 25.3%
* Reintegration of Montabaur into Hesse 20.2%
* Reconstitution of Baden 15.1%
The last petition was originally rejected by the Federal Minister of the Interior by reference to the referendum of 1951. However, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that the rejection was unlawful: the population of Baden had the right to a new referendum because the one of 1951 had taken place under different rules from the ones provided for by article 29. In particular, the outcome of the 1951 referendum did not reflect the wishes of the majority of Baden&#x27;s population.

The two Palatine petitions (for a reintegration into Bavaria and integration into Baden-Württemberg) failed with 7.6% and 9.3%. Further requests for petitions (Lübeck, Geesthacht, Lindau, Achberg, and 62 Hessian communities) had already been rejected as inadmissible by the Federal Minister of the Interior or were withdrawn as in the case of Lindau. The rejection was confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court in the case of Lübeck.

====Saar: the little reunification====

In the Paris Agreements of 23 October 1954, France offered to establish an independent &quot;Saarland&quot;, under the auspices of the Western European Union (WEU), but on 23 October 1955 in the Saar Statute referendum the Saar electorate rejected this plan by 67.7% to 32.3% (out of a 96.5% turnout: 423,434 against, 201,975 for) despite the public support of Federal German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the plan. The rejection of the plan by the Saarlanders was interpreted as support for the Saar to join the Federal Republic of Germany.

On 27 October 1956, the Saar Treaty established that Saarland should be allowed to join Germany, as provided by the German constitution. Saarland became part of Germany effective 1 January 1957. The Franco-Saarlander currency union ended on 6 July 1959, when the Deutsche Mark was introduced as legal tender in the Saarland.

====Constitutional amendments====
Paragraph 6 of Article 29 stated that, if a petition was successful, a referendum should be held within three years. Since the deadline passed on 5 May 1958 without anything happening, the Hesse state government filed a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court in October 1958. The complaint was dismissed in July 1961 on the grounds that Article 29 had made the new delimitation of the federal territory an exclusively federal matter. At the same time, the Court reaffirmed the requirement for a territorial revision as a binding order to the relevant constitutional bodies.

The grand coalition decided to settle the 1956 petitions by setting binding deadlines for the required referendums. The referendums in Lower Saxony and Rhineland-Palatinate were to be held by 31 March 1975, and the referendum in Baden was to be held by 30 June 1970. The threshold for a successful vote was set at one-quarter of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections. Paragraph 4 stated that the vote should be disregarded if it contradicted the objectives of paragraph 1.

In his investiture address, given on 28 October 1969 in Bonn, Chancellor Willy Brandt proposed that the government would consider Article 29 of the Basic Law as a binding order. An expert commission was established, named after its chairman, the former Secretary of State Professor Werner Ernst. After two years of work, the experts delivered their report in 1973. It provided an alternative proposal for the two regions: the north and center-southwest.

In the north, either a single new state consisting of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen and Lower Saxony should be created (solution A) or two new states, one in the northeast consisting of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg and the northern part of Lower Saxony (from Cuxhaven to Lüchow-Dannenberg) and one in the northwest consisting of Bremen and the rest of Lower Saxony (solution B).

In the center and southwest, one alternative was that Rhineland-Palatinate (with the exception of the Germersheim district but including the Rhine-Neckar region) should be merged with Hesse and the Saarland (solution C), the district of Germersheim would then become part of Baden-Württemberg. The other alternative was that the Palatinate (including the region of Worms) could be merged with the Saarland and Baden-Württemberg, and the rest of Rhineland-Palatinate would then merge with Hesse (solution D).

Both alternatives could be combined (AC, BC, AD, BD).

At the same time, the commission developed criteria for classifying the terms of Article 29 Paragraph 1. The capacity to perform functions effectively was considered most important, whereas regional, historical, and cultural ties were considered as hardly verifiable. To fulfill administrative duties adequately, a population of at least five million per state was considered as necessary.

After a relatively brief discussion and mostly negative responses from the affected states, the proposals were shelved. Public interest was limited or nonexistent.

The referendum in Baden was held on 7 June 1970. 81.9% of voters decided for Baden to remain part of Baden-Württemberg, only 18.1% opted for the reconstitution of the old state of Baden.

The referendums in Lower Saxony and Rhineland-Palatinate were held on 19 January 1975 (the percentages given are the percentages of those eligible who voted in favour):
* reconstitution of the Free State of Oldenburg 31%
* reconstitution of the Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe 39.5% 
* integration of Koblenz and Trier into North Rhine-Westphalia 13% 
* reintegration of Rheinhessen into Hesse 7.1% 
* reintegration of Montabaur region into Hesse 14.3%

The votes in Lower Saxony were successful as both proposals were supported by more than 25% of eligible voters. The Bundestag, however, decided that both Oldenburg and Schaumburg-Lippe should remain part of Lower Saxony. The justification was that a reconstitution of the two former states would contradict the objectives of paragraph 1 of article 29 of the constitution. An appeal against the decision was rejected as inadmissible by the Federal Constitutional Court.

On 24 August 1976, the binding provision for a new delimitation of the federal territory was altered into a mere discretionary one. Paragraph 1 of Article 29 was rephrased, with the provision that any state had to be &quot;of a size and capacity to perform its functions effectively&quot; put first. The option for a referendum in the Federal Republic as a whole (paragraph 4) was abolished, which meant territorial revision was no longer possible against the will of the population affected by it.

===Reunited Germany, 1990–present===
East Germany had originally consisted of five states (i.e., Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia). In 1952, these states were abolished and the East was divided into 14 administrative districts called &quot;Bezirke&quot;. Soviet-controlled East Berlin – despite officially having the same status as West Berlin – was declared East Germany&#x27;s capital and its 15th district.

The debate on territorial revision restarted shortly before German reunification. While academics (Rutz and others) and politicians (Gobrecht) suggested introducing only two, three, or four states in East Germany, legislation reconstituted the East German states in an arrangement similar to that which they had had before 1952, as the five &quot;New States&quot; on 3 October 1990. The former district of East Berlin joined West Berlin to form the new state of Berlin. Henceforth, the 10 &quot;old states&quot; plus 5 &quot;new states&quot; plus the new state Berlin add up to current 16 states of Germany.

After reunification, the constitution was amended to state that the citizens of the 16 states had successfully achieved the unity of Germany in free self-determination and that the West German constitution thus applied to the entire German people. Article 23, which had allowed &quot;any other parts of Germany&quot; to join, was rephrased. It had been used in 1957 to reintegrate the Saar Protectorate as the Saarland into the Federal Republic, and this was used as a model for German reunification in 1990. The amended article now defines the participation of the Federal Council and the 16 German states in matters concerning the European Union. Article 29 was again modified and provided an option for the states to &quot;revise the division of their existing territory or parts of their territory by agreement without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (2) through (7)&quot;. Article 118a was introduced into the Basic Law and provided the possibility for Berlin and Brandenburg to merge &quot;without regard to the provisions of Article 29, by agreement between the two with the participation of their inhabitants who are entitled to vote&quot;. A state treaty between Berlin and Brandenburg was approved in both parliaments with the necessary two-thirds majority, but in a popular referendum of 5 May 1996, about 63% voted against the merger.

The German states can conclude treaties with foreign countries in matters within their own sphere of competence and with the consent of the federal government (Article 32 of the Basic Law). Typical treaties relate to cultural relationships and economic affairs.

Some states call themselves a &quot;free state&quot; (). It is merely a historic synonym for &quot;republic&quot; and was a description used by most German states after the abolishment of monarchy after World War I. Today, is associated emotionally with a more independent status, especially in Bavaria. However, it has no legal significance. All sixteen states are represented at the federal level in the (Federal Council), where their voting power depends on the size of their population.

==Politics==

===Relationship with the Federation===
Federalism is one of the entrenched constitutional principles of Germany. Accordingly, the states form a considerable counterweight to the power of the federation. In principle, the power to enact laws lies with the states; the federation can only enact its own laws if the Basic Law explicitly assigns it legislative powers in the respective area. This can be done in two ways:
*The federation can be granted exclusive legislative authority. In this case, the federation alone is authorized to legislate in this area. This applies, for example, to foreign and defense policy.
*The federation can be granted the right to concurrent legislation. In this case, the federation and the states can both enact laws in the respective area; in case of doubt, however, a federal law takes precedence over a state law. This applies, for example, to tax law.
In other areas, only the states are authorized to legislate; this includes, among other things, police law and culture (which in Germany also encompasses the school, vocational training, and university systems).

Even in the areas that the Basic Law assigns to the federal government in whole or in part, the states retain influence on legislation, since the state governments are involved in legislation at the federal level through the Bundesrat. Above all, the federal government can only assume additional powers that have so far resided with the states if the constitution is amended, which requires, among other things, a two-thirds majority in the Bundesrat. The states cannot therefore be disempowered against their will.

===Government===

The federal constitution stipulates that the structure of each Federated State&#x27;s government must &quot;conform to the principles of republican, democratic, and social government, based on the rule of law&quot; (Article 28). Most of the states are governed by a cabinet led by a &quot;Ministerpräsident&quot; (minister-president), together with a unicameral legislative body known as the &quot;Landtag&quot; (State Diet). The states are parliamentary republics and the relationship between their legislative and executive branches mirrors that of the federal system: the legislatures are popularly elected for four or five years (depending on the state), and the minister-president is then chosen by a majority vote among the &quot;Landtag&quot;″s members. The minister-president is typically the head of the biggest party of a coalition. The minister-president appoints a cabinet to run the state&#x27;s agencies and to carry out the executive duties of the state&#x27;s government. Like in other parliamentary systems, the legislature can dismiss or replace the minister-president after a successful no-confidence vote.

The governments in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg are referred to as &quot;senates&quot;. In the free states of Bavaria and Saxony, the government is referred to as &quot;state government&quot; &quot;(Staatsregierung)&quot;; and in the other states, the government is referred to as &quot;Land government&quot; &quot;(Landesregierung)&quot;. Before 1 January 2000, Bavaria had a bicameral parliament, with a popularly elected &quot;Landtag&quot;, and a Senate made up of representatives of the state&#x27;s major social and economic groups. The Senate was abolished following a referendum in 1998. The states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg are governed slightly differently from the other states. In each of those cities, the executive branch consists of a Senate of approximately eight, selected by the state&#x27;s parliament; the senators carry out duties equivalent to those of the ministers in the larger states. The equivalent of the minister-president is the &quot;Senatspräsident&quot; (president of the senate), also commonly referred to as &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; (Mayor) in Bremen, the &quot;Erster Bürgermeister&quot; (first mayor) in Hamburg, and the &quot;Regierender Bürgermeister&quot; (governing mayor) in Berlin. The parliament for Berlin is called the &quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot; (House of Representatives), while Bremen and Hamburg both have a &quot;Bürgerschaft&quot;. The parliaments in the remaining 13 states are referred to as &quot;Landtag&quot; (State Parliament).

==Subdivisions==

The city-states of Berlin and Hamburg are subdivided into Districts. The City of Bremen consists of two urban districts: Bremen and Bremerhaven, which are not contiguous. In the other states there are the subdivisions below.

===Area associations (&quot;Landschaftsverbände&quot;)===
The most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia is uniquely divided into two area associations (&quot;Landschaftsverbände&quot;), one for the Rhineland, and one for Westphalia-Lippe. This arrangement was meant to ease the friction caused by uniting the two culturally different regions into a single state after World War II. The &quot;Landschaftsverbände&quot; now have very little power.

The constitution of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern at §75 states the right of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern to form &quot;Landschaftsverbände&quot;, although these two constituent parts of the state are not represented in the current administrative division.

===Governmental districts (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;)===
The large states of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia are divided into governmental districts, or .

In Rhineland-Palatinate, these districts were abolished or re-organized on 1 January 2000, in Saxony-Anhalt on 1 January 2004, and in Lower Saxony on 1 January 2005. From 1990 until 2012, Saxony was divided into three districts (called &quot;Direktionsbezirke&quot; since 2008). In 2012, these districts&#x27; authorities were merged into one central authority, the &quot;.

===Administrative districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;)===

The Districts of Germany &quot;(Kreise)&quot; are administrative districts, and every state except the city-states of Berlin and Hamburg and the state of Bremen consists of &quot;rural districts&quot; &quot;(Landkreise),&quot; District-free Towns/Cities (&quot;Kreisfreie Städte&quot;, in Baden-Württemberg also called &quot;urban districts&quot;, or &quot;Stadtkreise&quot;), cities that are districts in their own right, or local associations of a special kind &quot;(Kommunalverbände besonderer Art),&quot; see below. The state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen consists of two urban districts, while Berlin and Hamburg are states and urban districts at the same time.

As of 2011, there are 295 &quot;Landkreise&quot; and 107 &quot;Kreisfreie Städte&quot;, making 402 districts altogether. Each consists of an elected council and an executive, which is chosen either by the council or by the people, depending on the state, the duties of which are comparable to those of a county executive in the United States, supervising local government administration. The &quot;Landkreise&quot; have primary administrative functions in specific areas, such as highways, hospitals, and public utilities.

Local associations of a special kind are an amalgamation of one or more &quot;Landkreise&quot; with one or more &quot;Kreisfreie Städte&quot; to form a replacement of the aforementioned administrative entities at the district level. They are intended to implement simplification of administration at that level. Typically, a district-free city or town and its urban hinterland are grouped into such an association, or &quot;Kommunalverband besonderer Art&quot;. Such an organization requires the issuing of special laws by the governing state, since they are not covered by the normal administrative structure of the respective states.

In 2010 only three &quot;Kommunalverbände besonderer Art&quot; exist.
* District of Hanover: formed in 2001 from the rural district of Hanover and the district-free city of Hanover.
* &quot;Regionalverband&quot; (district association) of Saarbrücken: formed in 2008 from the &quot;Stadtverband Saarbrücken&quot; (city association of Saarbrücken), which was formed in 1974.
* City region of Aachen: formed in 2009 from the rural district of Aachen and the district-free city of Aachen.

===Offices (&quot;Ämter&quot;)===
Ämter (&quot;offices&quot; or &quot;bureaus&quot;): in some states, there is an administrative unit between the districts and the municipalities, called &quot;Ämter&quot; (singular &quot;Amt&quot;), &quot;Amtsgemeinden&quot;, &quot;Gemeindeverwaltungsverbände&quot;, &quot;Landgemeinden&quot;, &quot;Verbandsgemeinden&quot;, &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaften&quot;, or &quot;Kirchspiellandgemeinden&quot;.

===Municipalities (&quot;Gemeinden&quot;)===

Municipalities (&quot;Gemeinden&quot;): every rural district and every &quot;Amt&quot; is subdivided into municipalities, while every urban district is a municipality in its own right. There are () 12,141 municipalities, which are the smallest administrative units in Germany. Cities and towns are municipalities as well, also having city rights or town rights (&quot;Stadtrechte&quot;). Nowadays, this is mostly just the right to be called a city or town. However, in former times there were many other privileges, including the right to impose local taxes or to allow industry only within city limits. Municipalities have the competence to define the amount of taxes to be paid, esp. facing &quot;Gewerbesteuer&quot; (company tax) and &quot;Grundsteuer&quot; (property tax). Municipalities have the competence to deliver local services of general interest (so called &quot;Kommunale Daseinsvorsorge&quot;).

The number of inhabitants of German municipalities differs greatly, the most populous municipality being Berlin with nearly 3.8 million inhabitants, while the least populous municipalities (for instance, Gröde in Nordfriesland) have less than 10 inhabitants.

The municipalities are ruled by elected councils and by an executive, the mayor, who is chosen either by the council or directly by the people, depending on the state. The &quot;constitution&quot; for the municipalities is created by the states and is uniform throughout a state (except for Bremen, which allows Bremerhaven to have its own constitution).

The municipalities have two major policy responsibilities. First, they administer programs authorized by the federal or state government. Such programs typically relate to youth, schools, public health, and social assistance. Second, Article 28(2) of the Basic Law guarantees the municipalities &quot;the right to regulate on their own responsibility all the affairs of the local community within the limits set by law&quot;. Under this broad statement of competence, local governments can justify a wide range of activities. For instance, many municipalities develop and expand the economic infrastructure of their communities through the development of industrial trading estates.

Local authorities foster cultural activities by supporting local artists, building arts centres, and by holding fairs. Local government also provides public utilities, such as gas and electricity, as well as public transportation. The majority of the funding for municipalities is provided by higher levels of government rather than from taxes raised and collected directly by themselves.

In five of the German states, there are unincorporated areas, in many cases unpopulated forest and mountain areas, but also four Bavarian lakes that are not part of any municipality. As of 1 January 2005, there were 246 such areas, with a total area of 4167.66 km2 or 1.2% of the total area of Germany. Only four unincorporated areas are populated, with a total population of around 2,000. The table below provides an overview.
In 2000, the number of unincorporated areas was 295, with a total area of . However, the unincorporated areas are continually being incorporated into neighboring municipalities, wholly or partially, most frequently in Bavaria.

<text>James Shirley (or Sherley) (September 1596 – October 1666) was an English dramatist.

He belonged to the great period of English dramatic literature, but, in Charles Lamb&#x27;s words, he &quot;claims a place among the worthies of this period, not so much for any transcendent genius in himself, as that he was the last of a great race, all of whom spoke nearly the same language and had a set of moral feelings and notions in common.&quot; His career of play writing extended from 1625 to the suppression of stage plays by Parliament in 1642.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Shirley was born in London and was descended from the Shirleys of Warwick, the oldest knighted family in Warwickshire. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London, St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he took his BA degree in or before 1618.

His first poem, &quot;Echo, or the Unfortunate Lovers&quot; was published in 1618; no copy of it is known, but it is probably the same as 1646&#x27;s &quot;Narcissus&quot;. Oxford biographer Anthony Wood reports that, after earning his MA, Shirley became &quot;a minister of God&#x27;s word in or near St Albans&quot;. He then left this post, apparently due to a conversion to the Roman Catholic faith, and was master of St Albans School from 1623 to 1625. His first play, &quot;Love Tricks,&quot; seems to have been written while he was teaching at St Albans.

=== Playwright in London ===
In 1625 he returned to London, living in Gray&#x27;s Inn. In the following 18 years, he wrote more than 30 regular plays, tragedies, comedies, and tragicomedies. Most of his plays were performed by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men, the playing company for which Shirley served as house dramatist (much as William Shakespeare had for the King&#x27;s Men).

Shirley&#x27;s sympathies were with the King in his disputes with Parliament, and he received marks of special favour from the Queen. He made a bitter attack on William Prynne, who had attacked the stage in &quot;Histriomastix&quot;, and, in 1634 he supplied the text for &quot;The Triumph of Peace&quot;, a masque presented at Whitehall by the gentlemen of the Inns of Court as a practical reply to Prynne.

=== Dublin and return to London ===

Between 1636 and 1640 Shirley went to Ireland, apparently under the patronage of the Earl of Kildare. Three or four of his plays were produced by his friend John Ogilby in Dublin&#x27;s Werburgh Street Theatre, the first ever built in Ireland and at the time of Shirley&#x27;s visit only one year old. During his Dublin stay, Shirley wrote &quot;The Doubtful Heir&quot;, &quot;The Royal Master&quot;, &quot;The Constant Maid&quot;, and &quot;St. Patrick for Ireland&quot;.

In 1640 he returned to London, and found that in his absence Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men had sold off a dozen of his plays to the stationers, who published them in the late 1630s. As a result, he would no longer work for Queen Henrietta&#x27;s company, and the final plays of his London career were acted by the King&#x27;s Men.

=== Theatre closure and civil war ===

In 1642, his career as a playwright was stopped by the London theatre closure.

On the outbreak of the English Civil War, Shirley seems to have served with the Earl of Newcastle, but when the King&#x27;s fortunes began to decline he returned to London. He owed something to the kindness of Thomas Stanley, but supported himself chiefly by teaching and publishing some educational works under the Commonwealth. Besides these, he published during the Commonwealth period four small volumes of poems and plays, in 1646, 1653, 1655 and 1659. He &quot;was a drudge&quot; for John Ogilby in his translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

=== Late life and death ===

He survived into the reign of Charles II, but did not again attempt to write for the stage, though some of his comedies were revived.

Wood says that Shirley, aged 70, and his second wife died of fright and exposure after the Great Fire of London, and were buried at St Giles in the Fields on 29 October 1666.

==Assessment of writing==

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says of Shirley&#x27;s works:

*&quot;Honoria and Mammon&quot; (printed 1659; performed 21 November 2013)

In 1633, Shirley revised a play by John Fletcher, possibly called &quot;The Little Thief&quot;, into &quot;The Night Walker&quot;, which was acted in 1634 and printed in 1640. In 1634–35, Shirley revised &quot;The Tragedy of Chabot, Admiral of France&quot;, a play that George Chapman had written sometime between 1611 and 1622. The revised version was printed in 1639. Shirley has sometimes been credited as a collaborator with William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle on Cavendish&#x27;s plays &quot;The Country Captain&quot; and &quot;The Variety&quot; (both printed 1649). &quot;The Ball&quot;, in the publication attributed to George Chapman and James Shirley, was written by Shirley alone.

Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (1646) contained the epyllion &quot;Narcissus&quot; and the masque &quot;The Triumph of Beauty.&quot; &quot;A Contention for Honour and Riches&quot; (1633) appeared in an altered and enlarged form in 1659 as &quot;Honoria and Mammon.&quot; His &quot;Contention of Ajax and Ulysses&quot; closes with the well-known lyric &quot;The Glories of our Blood and State.&quot; In the final pedagogic stage of his career, Shirley published an English grammar written in poetry, titled &quot;Rudiments of Grammar: The Rules Composed in English Verse for the Greater Benefit and Delight of Young Beginners&quot; (1656).

Eight of Shirley&#x27;s plays were reprinted in a single quarto volume in 1640; these were &quot;The Young Admiral, The Duke&#x27;s Mistress, Hyde Park, Love&#x27;s Cruelty, The Wedding, The Constant Maid, The Opportunity,&quot; and &quot;The Grateful Servant&quot;. In 1653 another collection was published by Humphrey Moseley and Humphrey Robinson; titled &quot;Six New Plays,&quot; the volume included &quot;The Brothers, The Sisters, The Doubtful Heir, The Imposture, The Cardinal,&quot; and &quot;The Court Secret.&quot;

Shirley&#x27;s canon presents fewer problems and lost works than the canons of earlier dramatists; yet William Cooke registered a Shirley tragedy titled &quot;Saint Albans&quot; on 14 February 1639 – a play that has not survived. The anonymous tragedy &quot;Andromana&quot; was assigned to Shirley when it was first published in 1660, though scholars have treated the attribution with scepticism.

The standard edition of Shirley&#x27;s works is &quot;The Dramatic Works and Poems of James Shirley, with Notes by William Gifford, and Additional Notes, and some Account of Shirley and his Writings,&quot; by Alexander Dyce (6 vols., 1833). A selection of his plays was edited (1888) for the Mermaid Series, with an introduction by Edmund Gosse.

A new ten-volume edition of James Shirley&#x27;s work is currently being edited for Oxford University Press. Volume 7 in this series is forthcoming in 2022.

=== Revivals ===
Shirley&#x27;s work has occasionally seen revivals. &quot;Honoria and Mammon&quot; was staged in London at Shirley&#x27;s church, on 21 November 2013. &quot;The Cardinal&quot; has seen an adaptation, &quot;Red Snake&quot;, and a production in London in April 2017. &#x27;The Glories of Our Blood and State&#x27; (also known under the later title &#x27;The Glories of Our Birth and State&#x27;) from &quot;The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses&quot; was often set to music, and played at the coronation of George IV in 1821.

<text>The String Quartet, Op. 28, by Anton Webern is written for the standard string quartet group of two violins, viola and cello. It was the last piece of chamber music that Webern wrote (his other late works include two cantatas Op. 29/31 and the &quot;Variations for Orchestra, Op. 30&quot;).

The work was initially planned in November 1936 and was premiered at the Coolidge Festival in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on September 22, 1938, in response to a commission that year from Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. When Webern sent the score of the piece to Coolidge, he accompanied it with a letter saying that the piece was &quot;purely lyrical&quot; and comparing it to the two and three movement piano sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven.

It is in three movements:

The string quartet is atonal and uses twelve-tone technique. The tone row on which the piece is based (B, A, C, B, D, E, C, D, G, F, A, G) is based on the BACH motif (B, A, C, B) and is composed of three tetrachords:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 4/1
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 60
 bes1 a c b!
 dis e cis d
 ges, f aes g
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The first four notes of the row are the BACH motif itself, followed by its inversion, followed by same motif transposed up a minor sixth. A special property of this row is that its inversion (G, A, F, G, D, C, E, D, B, C, A, B) is equivalent to its retrograde.

The piece was first published in 1939 by Boosey &amp; Hawkes, and was the last of Webern&#x27;s works to be published in his lifetime. In 1955 another edition appeared from Universal Edition.

<text>Paul James Phillips (born June 26, 1975) is an American guitarist, most famous for being a member of the rock band Puddle of Mudd from 2001 to 2005 and again from 2009 to 2011. He has also played in the bands Happy Hour, Operator, Society Red and Rev Theory.

==Early life==
Paul Phillips picked up guitar when he was 11. His father played guitar in a cover band. His first guitar and amp was a Squier Strat and a small Peavey combo amp, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember what the name or model it was; I remember it was a small combo thing.&quot; Phillips said.

==Career==
Phillips first played guitar in the Jacksonville, Florida ska/punk band Happy Hour.

Phillips joined Puddle of Mudd when his friend Fred Durst invited him to audition for a band for Durst&#x27;s record label. He started with Puddle of Mudd on their 2001 hit album &quot;Come Clean&quot;. He also assisted with guitars and vocals in the group&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Life on Display&quot;. Phillips left the band in 2005, citing creative differences.

In 2007, he joined the band Operator, appearing on their debut album, &quot;Soulcrusher&quot;.

In 2008, Phillips briefly joined the Jacksonville, Florida band Society Red.

He returned to Puddle of Mudd in 2009 and played guitar in the group&#x27;s 2009 album, &quot;Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love &amp; Hate&quot; and on their 2011 cover album, &quot;&quot;.

On November 13, 2011, Phillips posted the following on his Facebook page: &quot;So here it is. The bombshell followed by silence. I will not be touring with Puddle on this upcoming run. I won&#x27;t be airing any dirty laundry in public. That&#x27;s not who I am. I just want to thank each and every one of you for your support throughout the years at shows and on my facebook page here. It means a lot. I&#x27;ve always tried to make myself accessible to you and have always tried to never let you down when I got up on that stage. However, there is nothing I can do&quot;.

Phillips contributed original music and scored several sections of the 2012 film &quot;Nitro Circus: The Movie&quot; with Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s former bassist, Damien Starkey.

Phillips acted in the 2013 horror short film &quot;The Guy Knows Everything&quot;.

He is currently working on a new project called The Fallout Collective, DJing on The Fox 107.7, and had a guest appearance on the TV show &quot;Real Fear&quot; on Chiller. He is also working on becoming a personal trainer and doing fitness photo shoots.

==Influences==
Phillips has been influenced by genres such as country rock, blues rock, with groups such as Guns N&#x27; Roses, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Nirvana.

==Personal life==
There was a wanted fugitive in 2006 who claimed to be Paul Phillips and was wanted for assault with a deadly weapon. As reported on the September 23, 2006 edition of America&#x27;s Most Wanted, the culprit, whose name is Martin Minter, was captured, one week after being featured on the program.

<text>Dorothee Steffensky-Sölle (; 1929–2003), known as Dorothee Sölle, was a German liberation theologian who coined the term &quot;Christofascism&quot;.

== Life and career==
Sölle was born Dorothee Nipperdey on 30 September 1929 in Cologne, Germany. Her father was Professor of labour law Hans Carl Nipperdey, who would later become the first president of the West-German Federal Labour Court from 1954 to 1963. Sölle studied theology, philosophy, and literature at the University of Cologne, earning a doctorate with a thesis on the connections between theology and poetry. She taught briefly in Aachen before returning to Cologne as a university lecturer. She became active in politics, speaking out against the Vietnam War, the arms race of the Cold War, and injustices in the developing world. Notably, from 1968 to 1972 she organized the (political night-prayers) in the Antoniterkirche (Cologne).

Between 1975 and 1987, she spent six months a year at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where she was a professor of systematic theology. Although she never held a professorship in Germany, she received an honorary professorship from the University of Hamburg in 1994.

She wrote a large number of books, including &quot;Theology for Skeptics: Reflections on God&quot; (1968), &quot;The Silent Cry: Mysticism and Resistance&quot; (1997), and her autobiography &quot;Against the Wind: Memoir of a Radical Christian&quot; (1999). In &quot;Beyond Mere Obedience: Reflections on a Christian Ethic for the Future&quot; she coined the term &quot;Christofascist&quot; to describe fundamentalists. Perhaps her best-known work in English was &quot;Suffering&quot;, which offers a critique of &quot;Christian masochism&quot; and &quot;Christian sadism&quot;. Sölle&#x27;s critique is against the assumption that God is all-powerful and the cause of suffering; humans thus suffer for some greater purpose. Instead, God suffers and is powerless alongside us. Humans are to struggle together against oppression, sexism, antisemitism, and other forms of authoritarianism.

Sölle was married twice and had four children. First, in 1954 she married the artist Dietrich Sölle, with whom she had three children before divorcing in 1964. In 1969, she married the former Benedictine priest , with whom she had her fourth child and with whom she organized the . The historian Thomas Nipperdey was her brother.

Sölle died of a heart attack at a conference in Göppingen on 27 April 2003. She was buried on the Friedhof Nienstedten in Hamburg.

==Sölle&#x27;s theological thinking==

&quot;I believe in God/ who created the world not ready made/ like a thing that must forever stay what it is/ who does not govern according to eternal laws/ that have perpetual validity/ nor according to natural orders/ of poor and rich,/ experts and ignoramuses,/ people who dominate and people subjected./ I believe in God/ who desires the counter-argument of the living/ and the alteration of every condition/ through our work/ through our politics.&quot; (ET, from Meditationen &amp; Gebrauchstexte. Gedichte. Berlin 1969, )

The idea of a God who was &quot;in heaven in all its glory&quot; while Auschwitz was organized was &quot;unbearable&quot; for Sölle. God has to be protected against such simplifications. For some people Sölle was a kind of prophet of Christianity, who abolished the separation of theological science and practice of life, while for others she was a heretic, whose theories couldn&#x27;t be reconciled with the traditional understanding of God, and her ideas were therefore rejected as a theological cynicism.
Some of Sölle&#x27;s provocative statements:
* &quot;Vietnam is Golgotha.&quot;
* &quot;The Third World is a permanent Auschwitz.&quot;
* &quot;Every theological statement must be a political statement as well.&quot; (&quot;Against the Wind: Memoir of a Radical Christian&quot; (1999))
* &quot;God has no hands except from our hands.&quot; (famous statement attributed to Teresa of Ávila which Sölle frequently used)
* &quot;We should eat more at the Eucharist and we should pray more when eating.&quot;

== Texts in music ==
* The musician Sergio Pinto converted Sölle&#x27;s poems &quot;Credo für die Erde&quot; and &quot;Ich dein Baum&quot;, into musical compositions which were published by Verlag in 2008 under the title &quot;entwurf&quot;. The CD recording was performed by the band Grupo Sal.
* The composer Ludger Stühlmeyer converted Sölle&#x27;s poems &quot;Kreuzigen&quot; and &quot;Atem Gottes hauch mich an&quot; into musical compositions as well. The vocal and organ arrangements were commissioned by a circle of friends of the Evangelische Akademie Tutzing; the work was first performed in April 2013 and included a reading by Ursula Baltz-Otto during a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the death of Dorothee Sölle.

<text>Amos Tappan Akerman (February 23, 1821 – December 21, 1880) was an American politician who served as United States Attorney General under President Ulysses S. Grant from 1870 to 1871.

A native of New Hampshire, Akerman graduated from Dartmouth College in 1842 and moved South, where he spent most of his career. He first worked as headmaster of a school in North Carolina and as a tutor in Georgia. Having become interested in law, Akerman studied and passed the bar in Georgia in 1850; where he and an associate set up a law practice. He also owned a farm and enslaved eleven people. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Akerman joined the Confederate Army, where he achieved the rank of colonel.

After the end of the war in 1865, Akerman joined the Republican Party during Reconstruction. He became an outspoken attorney advocate for freedmen&#x27;s civil rights in Georgia. Akerman was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as his U.S. Attorney General; with Grant&#x27;s support, he vigorously prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts. Akerman was assisted by Solicitor General Benjamin Bristow in the newly established Department of Justice. Attorney General Akerman also prosecuted important land grant cases that concerned railroads in a rapidly expanding West. Akerman advised on the United States first federal Civil Service Reform law implemented by President Grant and the U.S. Congress. Possibly due to Akerman&#x27;s rulings against the Union Pacific Railroad, Grant asked for Akerman&#x27;s resignation from the cabinet. Although Akerman left office at Grant&#x27;s request, he continued to support Grant. He returned to Georgia, practiced law, and remained highly popular in the state.

==Early years==
Akerman was born on February 23, 1821, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, as the ninth of twelve children of Benjamin Akerman and his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker (9/12/2002)&quot;&gt;Parker (9/12/2002), &quot;Amos T. Akerman (1821–1880)&quot;, viewed on 1-15-2015&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Phillips Exeter Academy prep school, and Dartmouth College, located in Hanover, where he graduated in the class of 1842 with Phi Beta Kappa honors.

==Headmaster, farmer, and law practice==

Upon graduation, Akerman moved South where the climate was thought better for his lung condition. He quickly got a job as a headmaster/instructor of a boy&#x27;s academy in Murfreesboro, North Carolina, at that time part of Richmond county. Akerman was known as a strict teacher. In 1846, he was hired by planter John Macpherson Berrien as a tutor for his children in Savannah, Georgia. Berrien had been President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Attorney General and was a prominent Whig. Akerman took advantage of Berrien&#x27;s extensive law library and became fascinated with the field. Akerman passed the Georgia Bar in 1850, and moved to Peoria, Illinois, where his sister resided, and briefly practiced law. Akerman returned to Georgia and practiced law in Clarksville.

Akerman returned to Georgia, where he opened a law practice in Elberton, with Robert Heston. In addition to practicing law, Akerman also farmed and enslaved eleven people. In terms of politics Akerman was a Whig.

==American Civil War==
Although he was against secession as a solution to the North–South conflicts, Akerman was loyal to his adopted state. At age 43, he joined the Confederate States Army in the spring of 1864. Akerman first served in General Robert Toombs&#x27; brigade and later in the quartermaster&#x27;s department where it was his job to procure and dispense uniforms, weapons and other supplies to the soldiers. Akerman was put into active service against the Union during Sherman&#x27;s 1864 march through Georgia.

==Reconstruction==
Akerman joined the Republican Party in the campaign for freedmen&#x27;s citizenship and suffrage. He was an outspoken proponent of Reconstruction as a member of Georgia&#x27;s 1868 state constitutional convention and when appointed as U.S. district attorney for Georgia (1869). His appointment was blocked for some time by Congress, since he had served in the Confederate army. Akerman served for a total period of six months in this position. Akerman also strongly advocated Georgia&#x27;s readmission into the Union and struggled to gain stability and federal compliance in the state.

==United States Presidential election 1868==
During the 1868 Presidential campaign, there was concern that Akerman supported presidential candidate Horatio Seymour over Grant. To stop the rumor, in a letter from Elberton, Akerman published his full endorsement for Ulysses S. Grant. He served as the Republican presidential state elector from Georgia. Akerman believed Grant would restore order and peace to the violence-plagued South. Akerman believed Grant would respect the &quot;rights of the laborer as a freeman, citizen and voter&quot;. Akerman wrote that violence in the South against blacks was motivated by revenge after the white Southerners had been defeated by the North, lost substantial property in the emancipation of slaves, had their society disrupted, and were temporarily disenfranchised. Akerman believed that Congressional Reconstruction had been the better plan for the Southern states, opposed to President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s plan. He believed that freedmen deserved federal protection from the law and he endorsed the enfranchisement of their men. Akerman admitted he was initially strongly opposed to blacks voting; however, his opinion changed as he came to believe that this was the only way that blacks could gain political power and protection.

==United States Attorney Georgia 1869 ==
In 1869 President Grant appointed Akerman as U.S. Attorney in Georgia. President Grant, initially, attempted to protect African American voters against white violence and discrimination by the use of State courts.

===White vs. Clement===
In June 1869, Akerman argued in defense of Richard W. White, a mulatto who had won the state election for Superior Court county clerk. White&#x27;s opponent, William James Clement, represented by Solicitor General Alfred B. Smith of the Eastern Georgia Circuit court, said that White was ineligible to hold office since he was a black man. A lower court had ruled that if Clement could prove that White was a black man, he could not hold office. The case went to the Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Court where Akerman defended White&#x27;s election and said his color did not deny him the right to hold office. Akerman argued that the former laws, based in the South&#x27;s slave society, did not apply anymore. The Reconstruction Act of 1867 stated that Georgia had no current civilian government. Akerman argued that since blacks had been granted the franchise throughout the United States, they had the right to hold public office. He argued that blacks had participated in the Georgia&#x27;s new constitutional government in 1868 without distinction of color. He also noted that both President Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant had appointed black men to public office and that the current U.S. Constitution did not recognize or discriminate on the basis of a person&#x27;s color. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court&#x27;s decision, ruling that White had the right to hold public office regardless of his race.

==United States Attorney General==
On June 17, 1870, Grant selected Akerman as United States Attorney General. Akerman was the &quot;only person from the Confederacy to reach cabinet rank during Reconstruction&quot;. Having become attorney general shortly after the creation of the new Justice Department, Akerman dealt with legal issues from the Department of the Interior, such as the question of whether competing railroad companies deserved more land in the West in return for expanding the country&#x27;s transportation system. He also dealt with the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal. He led enforcement efforts to suppress the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the South through litigation. He had experienced its violence first-hand. He oversaw prosecution of more than 1100 cases against KKK members, gaining convictions.

Akerman did not create the Department of Justice, but he helped play a pivotal role in its development. He helped to appoint members and set standards, but due to the geographical constraints, past laws, and financial restrictions he struggled to properly build a strong Department of Justice.

Akerman resigned on December 13, 1871.

===Ruled against Union Pacific===
On July 1, 1862, President Lincoln signed into law the Pacific Railroad Act that in addition to promoting the transcontinental railroad allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to make subsidiary railroad branch lines, including one through Kansas. One of these subsidiaries was financially unable to complete the railroad through Kansas, as a result, the Union Pacific applied for federal assistance in the form of land grants and bonds. On June 1, 1871, Attorney General Akerman denied land grants and bonds to the Union Pacific and upheld previous rulings against federal assistance. Company attorneys lobbied Akerman to change his mind, however, he refused to change his ruling. This upset Collis P. Huntington and Jay Gould, who were connected to the Union Pacific Railroad and demanded Akerman&#x27;s removal from office.

===Ruled on Civil Service Law===
On September 7, 1871, Att. Gen. Akerman ruled on the newly formed Civil Service Commission passed by Congress on March 3, 1871, and signed into law by President Grant on March 4. In the United States first ever Civil Service Reform legislation a commission was set up to establish rules, testing, and regulations, authorized by the President, for the best possible candidates to be appointed civil service positions. The funding for the Commission only lasted for one year until June 30, 1872. Akerman ruled that the commission, run by a chairman appointed by the President, was legal, since Congress and the President had every right in their constitutional power to put in the best candidates to serve in the United States Government. Akerman believed this was the original intent of the framers of the U.S. Constitution. Akerman, however, ruled that the Commission did not constitutionally have the power to forbid an appointment; only to aid the President and Congress to put in the best person qualified for the job. Akerman also ruled that the competitive testing need not be overly restrictive as to take away the appointment powers given to the President and Congress under the U.S. Constitution.

===Prosecuted Klan===

Having lived in Georgia, Att. Gen. Akerman was well aware of the widespread violent tactics, known as &quot;outrages&quot; of the Ku Klux Klan, conducted primarily against African American voters, who had mostly registered as Republicans. The Freedman&#x27;s Bureau in the Deep South were sent hundreds of complaints by blacks who had been persecuted and attacked by whites. One United States attorney of later years characterized this Klan activity as &quot;the worst outbreak of domestic violence in American history to date.&quot; Upon his assumption to office, Akerman&#x27;s primary duty was to stop the violence against blacks in the South and prosecute the perpetrators. His appointment by Grant in November 1870 was well timed, as he gained the strong enforcement powers of the newly created U.S. Department of Justice and the assistance of the newly created office of the U.S. Solicitor General. Having the Department of Justice and the first Solicitor General, Benjamin Bristow, Attorney General Akerman was ready to federally prosecute the Klan. Akerman, expanding the powers of the Department of Justice, started an investigating division that looked into the organization of the Klan in the South. Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, and it was signed into law by President Grant on April 20, 1871.

Akerman and Bristow acted quickly and efficiently. After Grant had suspended habeas corpus in nine South Carolina counties on October 17, 1871, Akerman, who had traveled to the state, personally led U.S. Marshals and the U.S. Army into the countryside and made hundreds of arrests, while 2000 Klansmen fled the state. With the assistance of Bristow, the Department of Justice indicted 3,000 Klansmen throughout the South, and gained convictions of 600. Sixty-five of the Klansmen convicted were sentenced to federal prison for five years. As a result of the government&#x27;s enforcement of the law against the Klan, its incidents of violence declined markedly. In 1872, African Americans voted in high numbers, electing numerous Republicans to state and local offices. White conservative Democrats continued to contest the elections, and there was violence related to a disputed gubernatorial election in Louisiana.

===Resignation controversy===
During December, while Akerman was busy prosecuting the Klan, he was unexpectedly asked to resign by President Grant. Rumor was that Grant was pressured by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, who sympathized with railroad tycoons Collis P. Huntington and Jay Gould, and had demanded Akerman&#x27;s resignation. Akerman had ruled against the government&#x27;s giving federal land grants and government bonds to the Union Pacific Railroad. Akerman denied that Delano was the reason for his departure from office.

William S. McFeely, author of a critical biography of Grant, wrote that Grant was uneasy concerning Akerman&#x27;s prosecution zeal against the Klan and did not want to appear as a military dictator grinding the South into submission. According to McFeely, with Akerman&#x27;s resignation &quot;went any hope that the Republican party would develop as a national party of true racial equality&quot;. However, historian Eric Foner noted that Akerman&#x27;s replacement, George H. Williams, continued to prosecute the Klan in the South. After Akerman resigned, he did not have any hard feelings towards President Grant. Akerman supported Grant&#x27;s renomination in 1872 and believed that the president would continue to enforce anti-terrorist laws.

==Return to Georgia and death==
Although he was offered another government job, he returned to Georgia, where he continued to practice law until his death in Cartersville, on December 21, 1880. He was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in the city.

==Family==
Days before he entered active Confederate Army service in 1864 during the American Civil War, Akerman married Martha Rebecca Galloway. The couple had eight children; one child died before adulthood. Their son Alexander Akerman achieved notability.

==Honors and historical recognition==
===Cartersville&#x27;s Oak Hill Akerman monument===
An Akerman monument was placed at Akerman&#x27;s gravesite in Cartersville&#x27;s Oak Hill Cemetery.

<text>Werra-Meißner is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Göttingen, Eichsfeld, Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis, Wartburgkreis, district-free Eisenach, Hersfeld-Rotenburg, Schwalm-Eder-Kreis, Kassel.

==History==
The district was created in 1974 by merging the two districts of Eschwege and Witzenhausen, which had both existed with only slight modifications since 1821.

==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Werra. The Hoher Meißner at is the highest elevation of the Meißner mountains, a big basalt massif, the other geographical feature which gave the district its name.
The Hoher Meissner was also home to US military forces up to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Soldiers of the Special Forces guarded the eavesdropping post on the hilltop.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show a branch of an ash tree in the dexter side, as sign for the former Eschwege district as well as the Eschwege city - the German word for ash tree is &quot;Esche&quot;. The castle in the main field is the castle Ludwigstein, taken from the coat of arms of the Witzenhausen district. The hills below symbolize the landscape, the &quot;Meißner&quot;, and the wavy line the Werra river.

<doc id="217462" wikidata="Q1074954" url="?curid=217462" title="Paleoconservatism">
<text>Paleoconservatism is a political philosophy and a paternalistic strain of conservatism in the United States stressing American nationalism, Christian ethics, regionalism, traditionalist conservatism, and non-interventionism. Paleoconservatism&#x27;s concerns overlap with those of the Old Right that opposed the New Deal in the 1930s and 1940s as well as with paleolibertarianism. By the start of the 21st century, the movement had begun to focus more on issues of race.

The terms &quot;neoconservative&quot; and &quot;paleoconservative&quot; were coined by Paul Gottfried in the 1980s, but the term originated following the outbreak of the Vietnam War and a divide in American conservatism between the interventionists and the isolationists. Those in favor of the Vietnam War then became known as the &quot;neoconservatives&quot; (interventionists), as they marked a decisive split from the nationalist-isolationism that the traditionalist conservatives (isolationists) had subscribed to up until this point. Paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration, a rollback of multicultural programs and large-scale demographic change, the decentralization of federal policy, the restoration of controls upon free trade, a greater emphasis upon economic nationalism and non-interventionism in the conduct of American foreign policy.

Historian George Hawley states that although influenced by paleoconservatism, Donald Trump is not a paleoconservative, but rather a nationalist and a right-wing populist. Hawley also argued in 2017 that paleoconservatism was an exhausted force in American politics but that for a time it represented the most serious right-wing threat to the mainstream conservative movement. Regardless of how Trump himself is categorized, others regard the movement known as Trumpism as supported by, if not a rebranding of, paleoconservatism. From this view, the followers of the Old Right did not fade away so easily and continue to have significant influence in the Republican Party and the entire country.

== Terminology ==
The prefix &quot;paleo&quot; derives from the Greek root (&quot;palaiós&quot;), meaning &quot;ancient&quot; or &quot;old&quot;. It is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and refers to the paleoconservatives&#x27; claim to represent a more historic, authentic conservative tradition than that found in neoconservatism. Adherents of paleoconservatism often describe themselves simply as &quot;paleo&quot;. Rich Lowry of &quot;National Review&quot; claims the prefix &quot;is designed to obscure the fact that it is a recent ideological creation of post-Cold War politics&quot;.

Samuel T. Francis, Thomas Fleming, and some other paleoconservatives de-emphasized the &quot;conservative&quot; part of the &quot;paleoconservative&quot; label, saying that they do not want the &quot;status quo&quot; preserved. Fleming and Paul Gottfried called such thinking &quot;stupid tenacity&quot; and described it as &quot;a series of trenches dug in defense of last year&#x27;s revolution&quot;. Francis defined authentic conservatism as &quot;the survival and enhancement of a particular people and its institutionalized cultural expressions&quot;.

== Ideology ==
Paleoconservatives support restrictions on immigration, decentralization, trade tariffs and protectionism, economic nationalism, isolationism, and a return to traditional conservative ideals relating to gender, race, sexuality, culture, and society.

Paleoconservatism differs from neoconservatism in opposing free trade and promoting republicanism. Paleoconservatives see neoconservatives as imperialists and themselves as defenders of the republic.

Paleoconservatives tend to oppose abortion, gay marriage, and LGBTQ rights.

=== Human nature, tradition, and reason ===
Paleoconservatives believe that tradition is a form of reason, rather than a competing force. Mel Bradford wrote that certain questions are settled before any serious deliberation concerning a preferred course of conduct may begin. This ethic is based in a &quot;culture of families, linked by friendship, common enemies, and common projects&quot;, so a good conservative keeps &quot;a clear sense of what Southern grandmothers have always meant in admonishing children, &#x27;we don&#x27;t do that&#x27;&quot;.

Pat Buchanan argues that a good politician must &quot;defend the moral order rooted in the Old and New Testament and Natural Law&quot;—and that &quot;the deepest problems in our society are not economic or political, but moral&quot;.

=== Southern traditionalism ===
According to historian Paul V. Murphy, paleoconservatives developed a focus on localism and states&#x27; rights. From the mid-1980s onward, &quot;Chronicles&quot; promoted a Southern traditionalist worldview focused on national identity, regional particularity, and skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power. According to Hague, Beirich, and Sebesta (2009), the antimodernism of the paleoconservative movement defined the neo-Confederate movement of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, notable paleoconservatives argued that desegregation, welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislation and think tanks. Paleoconservatives also claimed the Southern Agrarians as forebears in this regard. 

=== Opposition to Israel ===
Paleoconservatives are generally critics of Israel and supporters of the Arab cause in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; they have argued that supporting the country damages foreign relations with the Islamic world and American interests abroad. Buchanan has asserted that &quot;Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory&quot;. Russell Kirk argued that &quot;Not seldom has it seemed... as if some eminent Neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States&quot;. During the Israel-Hamas War, paleoconservative Tucker Carlson argued Israel was guilty of war crimes, and that President Joe Biden&#x27;s support of the country risked American complicitness in the actions.

<doc id="217469" wikidata="Q4041439" url="?curid=217469" title="INT (x86 instruction)">
<text>INT is an assembly language instruction for x86 processors that generates a software interrupt. It takes the interrupt number formatted as a byte value.

When written in assembly language, the instruction is written like this:

:codice_1

where codice_2 is the software interrupt that should be generated (0-255).

As is customary with machine binary arithmetic, interrupt numbers are often written in hexadecimal form, which can be indicated with a prefix &quot;0x&quot; or with the suffix &quot;h&quot;. For example, codice_3 will generate the 20th software interrupt (0x13 is nineteen (19) in hexadecimal notation, and the count starts at 0), causing the function pointed to by the 20th vector in the interrupt table to be executed.

INT is widely used in real mode. In protected mode, INT is a privileged instruction.

== Real mode ==
When generating a &quot;software interrupt&quot;, the processor calls one of the 256 functions pointed to by the interrupt address table, which is located in the first 1024 bytes of memory while in real mode (see interrupt vector). It is therefore entirely possible to use a far-call instruction to start the interrupt-function manually after pushing the flag register.

An example of a useful DOS &quot;software interrupt&quot; was interrupt 0x21. By calling it with different parameters in the registers (mostly ah and al) you could access various IO operations, string output and more.

Most Unix systems and derivatives do not use &quot;software interrupts&quot;, with the exception of interrupt 0x80, used to make system calls. This is accomplished by entering a 32-bit value corresponding to a kernel function into the EAX register of the processor and then executing INT 0x80.

== INT3 ==
The INT3 instruction is a one-byte-instruction defined for use by debuggers to temporarily replace an instruction in a running program in order to set a code breakpoint. The more general INT XXh instructions are encoded using two bytes. This makes them unsuitable for use in patching instructions (which can be one byte long); see SIGTRAP.

The opcode for INT3 is codice_4, as opposed to the opcode for INT immediate8, which is codice_5. Since the dedicated codice_4 opcode has some desired special properties for debugging, which are not shared by the normal two-byte opcode for an INT3, assemblers do not normally generate the generic codice_7 opcode from mnemonics.

== INTO ==
The INTO instruction is another one-byte-instruction. It is a conditional &quot;interrupt&quot; which is triggered when the overflow flag is set at the time of executing this opcode. This implicitly indicates interrupt #4.

The opcode for INTO is codice_8, however it is unavailable in x86-64 mode.

<text>Leopoldstadt (; ; &quot;Leopold-Town&quot;) is the 2nd municipal district of Vienna () in Austria. there are 103,233 inhabitants over . It is situated in the heart of the city and, together with Brigittenau (20th district), forms a large island surrounded by the Danube Canal and, to the north, the Danube. It is named after Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. Due to its relatively high percentage of Jewish inhabitants before the Holocaust (38.5 percent in 1923), Leopoldstadt gained the nickname (&#x27;Matzo Island&#x27;). This context was a significant aspect for the district twinning with the New York City borough Brooklyn in 2007.

==Landmarks==
Places of interest include the &quot;Wiener Prater&quot; (from Latin &quot;pratum&quot; &quot;meadow&quot;), former imperial hunting grounds to which the public was denied access until 1766. The area of the &quot;Prater&quot; closest to the city centre contains a large amusement park, known as the &quot;Volksprater&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Prater&quot;) or &quot;Wurstelprater&quot; (after the Harlequin-type figure of &quot;Hanswurst&quot;), and at its entrance there is the giant Wiener Riesenrad Ferris wheel opened in 1897 which features prominently in the movie &quot;The Third Man&quot; and which has become one of Vienna&#x27;s landmarks. The &quot;Schweizerhaus&quot; (&quot;Swiss Hut&quot;), an establishment boasting a huge beer garden, sells the original Czech Budweiser draught beer. The owners claim that, back in the 1920s, the potato crisp was invented there. Nearby you can find the &quot;Republic of Kugelmugel&quot;, a micronation proclaimed in 1984 that became a landmark of the area. There is also a miniature steam railway (&quot;Liliputbahn&quot;) which, on its track through the woodland parallel to the &quot;Hauptallee&quot;, passes Vienna&#x27;s Ernst-Happel-Stadion.

Another, smaller, park in Leopoldstadt is the topiary-type Augarten, which is the home of the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir and of a porcelain manufactory (&quot;Augarten-Porzellan&quot;). Its distinguishing marks are two disused Flak towers built towards the end of the Second World War. For features of this versatile district not listed here, see the bottom-linked &quot;Leopoldstadt Category&quot; page.

== Jewish Leopoldstadt ==

In 1625, Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller became the rabbi of Vienna. At the time, the Jews of Vienna were scattered throughout the city, not having a central community. Heller obtained for the Jews the right to establish a central Jewish community in Leopoldstadt, which was already then a suburb of Vienna. He was instrumental in reorganizing the community, and he drew up its constitution.

By the mid-17th century, part of the built-up area was the Jewish ghetto. At that time the area was called , with the Jewish population living in an area called . The hatred that Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor held for the Jews led to the forceful expulsion of the Jewish community in 1670 (Vienna, from , &#x27;decree&#x27;), with the popular support of the local non-Jewish population. As a thanksgiving for the expulsion, the inhabitants renamed the area (&#x27;Leopold&#x27;s city&#x27;), after the emperor. During the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Jewish immigrants from eastern parts of the realm again flocked to Leopoldstadt, owing to the proximity of the railway station, which was one of the main railway stations at which migrants from other parts of the empire arrived in Vienna. The high number of Jewish inhabitants led to the area being called (&#x27;Island of Matzo&#x27;, referring to the unleavened bread eaten during Passover). Several important synagogues were located there, including the , the , the , the , and the , as well as yeshivas.

None of the synagogues escaped the destruction during the pogroms of November 1938 following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. A fragment of a Torah scroll was saved by Heschel Messias from one of the synagogues as it burned. The Jewish population was increasingly isolated and terrorised and was finally deported and exterminated in concentration camps such as Auschwitz. The once thriving communal life was completely destroyed. Only a handful of survivors were able to hide until the end of the war, from an original population of several thousands.

With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and renewed immigration from Eastern Europe, especially the former Soviet Union, the Jewish population of Leopoldstadt was able to grow again. Today, many members of Vienna&#x27;s Jewish community live there again, and there are a number of shops and restaurants selling kosher food. Several parts of the old residential areas have been gentrified, resulting in a gentle shift from Leopoldstadt&#x27;s traditional, predominantly working class roots towards a somewhat wealthier population.

==Transport==
The U1 metro line runs east to west through central Leopoldstadt, with stops at Nestroyplatz and Praterstern and Vorgartenstrasse. The U2 metro line, opened in May 2008 in time for the European Football Championship, links Leopoldstadt with the northern edge of the city centre and runs south east over the Donaustadtbrücke.

Praterstern railway station provides direct links to Vienna International Airport in the south and Floridsdorf to the north east, and inner city stations Wien Mitte and Wien Hauptbahnhof. The station sits amid a large roundabout, which connects to the A22 Donauufer Autobahn over the Reichsbrücke.

Multiple tram lines service the district, including the terminal of the &#x27;1&#x27; tram in the Wiener Prater.
== Coat of arms ==

The arms of the Leopoldstadt district, since the retirement of Brigittenau from the 2nd District, contains three parts, symbolizing the former independent communities:
* Saint Leopold in the upper left part (heraldic: upper right) part, symbolizes the historical Leopoldstadt, the former Lower Werd, the area between Augarten, Taborstraße and the Danube Canal. He is in a blue gown and a red cloak, trimmed with ermine; on his head, he wears the crown of the dukes of Austria. In his hands, he holds the banner of the archduchy of Austria below the Enns, and also a church model that symbolizes the patronage of the parish church.
* The upper right (heraldic: upper left) part of the crest represents the district section Jägerzeile, the area around today&#x27;s Praterstraße. It shows the stag of St. Hubert in silver on a green meadow. On the head of the stag are 12-point golden antlers, and a golden cross in the middle. As a symbol of the hunt, the stag represents the earlier use of the Prater and the Danube as a hunting area.
* The lower part of the coat of arms stands for the district section of Zwischenbrücken. It shows a red tongue on a blue background, surrounded by a golden halo, which has five gold stars. The emblem symbolizes St. John of Nepomuk, the patron saint of bridges. Before the regulation of the Danube in 1870–75, the area lay between several branches of the Danube and its bridges.

=== Museums ===
The Leopoldstadt Museum has a particular emphasis on the arts. The focus is on, inter alia, the Theater in Leopoldstadt, the Carl-Theater, the Leopoldstädter Theater, the Prater, and the Jewish Ghetto. The &quot;Museum für Unterhaltungskunst&quot; covers the history of clowns, artists, and circuses; whereas the &quot;Museum des Blindenwesens&quot; in his exhibition shows the development of teaching and lessons for the blind and Braille. The &quot;Wiener Kriminalmuseum&quot; (&quot;Vienna Crime Museum&quot;), connected with the Museum of the Vienna Federal Police Directorate, brings the visitor closer to the history of the judiciary and the police and of criminality from the late Middle Ages forward.

Two major museums in Vienna have branch offices in Leopoldstadt. The Vienna Museum (formerly the Museum of the City of Vienna) operates the Prater Museum (next to the Ferris wheel) on the history of the Wurstelprater amusement park and also allows visits to the home of the &quot;Waltz King&quot; Johann Strauss the Younger in the Praterstraße. The Belvedere has also two branch offices in the 2nd District: &quot;Augarten&quot; Contemporary (contemporary art) and the neighboring Gustinus-Ambrosi Museum. The Augarten factory has regular exhibits of porcelain in the foyer of the Palais Augarten.

=== Theater ===
In the great hall of the former Agricultural Products Exchange (Taborstraße 10), the team of Serapions Ensembles to Erwin Piplits and Ulrike Kaufmann with the assistance of the City Council until 1988, created the Odeon, a flexible theater space of considerable proportions. The Serapionsensemble, Neue Oper Wien, and other artists appear here. The name recalls the Odeon dance hall, which was located in the area of today&#x27;s Odeongasse, behind the Agricultural Exchange. Opened in 1845 and destroyed by fire in 1848, it was the largest dance hall in Vienna at that time, with room for several thousand persons.

=== Outdoor cinema and former cinemas ===
As a traditional theater district, Leopoldstadt had, in the middle of the 20th century, numerous cinemas. As a result of the spread of television in Austria from the late 1950s, cinemas began to close in the 1960s, by which the 2nd District was severely affected. By and by, Leopold townspeople cinemas were closed, and now there is no single regular cinema in the district area. Even the UCI opened in 1999, at the Mehrsälekino Lassallestraße, was already closed three years later because of poor attendance.

The former cinemas, in the order of closure, are:

* Stern (Rotensterngasse 7a), −1962
* Adria (Am Tabor 22), −1964
* Diana (Praterstraße 25), −1968
* Luna (Taborstraße 69), −1971
* Planetarium Studio 2 (Oswald Thomas Platz 1, at the Planetarium), −1972
* Augarten (Malzgasse 2), −1973
* Nestroy (Nestroyplatz, im Nestroyhof), −1975
* Wohlmuth (Wohlmuthstraße 15–17), −1979
* Filmpalast (Prater, near Wiener Riesenrad), −1981 (abgebrannt); aka &quot;Lustspieltheater&quot;, &quot;Lustspielkino&quot;, &quot;Leopoldstädter Volkskino&quot; und &quot;Tegethoff&quot;
* Helios (Taborstraße 36), −1983
* Münstedt Kino Palast (Prater), −1984
* Panorama Center 1–3 (Praterstern, in Schnellbahnviadukt), −1993; first Mehrsälekino of Vienna.
* Tabor (Taborstraße 8), −1996
* Prater Nonstop (Prater), −1997; Sexkino
* UCI (Lassallestraße 7a), −2002; 1999 opened as Mehrsälekino

This development is however an increasing demand for outdoor summer cinema, since the early 1990s, before the Vienna City Hall every summer, the Film Festival at the Vienna City Hall Square takes place. In the 2nd District, there are currently four summer open-air cinemas:

* Kino unter Sternen (&quot;Cinema under the stars&quot;) – Augarten, beim Flakturm
* Kino wie noch nie (&quot;Cinema as never before&quot;) – Augartenspitz, Obere Augartenstraße 1
* Prater Film Festival (Kaiserweise, before the Wiener Riesenrad)
* Sommerkino Tribüne Krieau (&quot;Summer movie gallery&quot;) – Trabrennplatz Krieau

In Augarten (Obere Augartenstraße 1), the Austrian film archive established here and at the Metro Cinema (1st district) shows historical films and scientific research.

<doc id="217472" wikidata="Q138045" url="?curid=217472" title="Eternity">
<text>Eternity, in common parlance, is an infinite amount of time that never ends or the quality, condition or fact of being everlasting or eternal. Classical philosophy, however, defines eternity as what is timeless or exists outside time, whereas sempiternity corresponds to infinite duration.

== Philosophy ==
Classical philosophy defines eternity as what exists outside time, as in describing timeless supernatural beings and forces, distinguished from sempiternity which corresponds to infinite time, as described in requiem prayers for the dead. Some thinkers, such as Aristotle, suggest the eternity of the natural cosmos in regard to both past and future eternal duration. Boethius defined eternity as &quot;simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life&quot;. Thomas Aquinas believed that God&#x27;s eternity does not cease, as it is without either a beginning or an end; the concept of eternity is of divine simplicity, thus incapable of being defined or fully understood by humankind.

Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) and many others in the Age of Enlightenment drew on the classical distinction to put forward metaphysical hypotheses such as &quot;eternity is a permanent now&quot;.

=== Contemporary philosophy and physics ===
Today cosmologists, philosophers, and others look towards analyses of the concept from across cultures and history. They debate, among other things, whether an absolute concept of eternity has real application for fundamental laws of physics; compare the issue of entropy as an arrow of time.

== Religion ==
Eternity as infinite duration is an important concept in many lives and religions. God or gods are often said to endure eternally, or exist for all time, forever, without beginning or end. Religious views of an afterlife may speak of it in terms of eternity or eternal life. Christian theologians may regard immutability, like the eternal Platonic forms, as essential to eternity.

== Symbolism ==
Eternity is often symbolized by the endless snake, swallowing its own tail, the ouroboros. The circle, band, or ring is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, . Symbolically these are reminders that eternity has no beginning or end.

<doc id="217473" wikidata="Q2460755" url="?curid=217473" title="Kingdom of Sweden (800–1521)">
<text>Swedish pre-history ends around 800 AD, when the Viking Age begins and written sources are available. The Viking Age lasted until the mid-11th century. Scandinavia was formally Christianized by 1100 AD. The period 1050 to 1350—when the Black Death struck Europe—is considered the Older Middle Ages. The Kalmar Union between the Scandinavian countries was established in 1397 and lasted until King Gustav Vasa ended it upon seizing power during the Swedish War of Liberation, which concluded in 1523. The period from 1350 to 1523 is considered the Younger Middle Ages. During these centuries, Sweden gradually consolidated as a single nation.

==Viking Age==

Until the 9th century, the Scandinavian people lived in small Germanic kingdoms and chiefdoms known as petty kingdoms. These Scandinavian kingdoms and their royal rulers are mainly known from legends and scattered continental sources as well as from runestones. The Scandinavian people appeared as a group separate from other Germanic nations, and at this time there was a noticeable increase in war expeditions (Viking raids) on foreign countries, which has given the name Viking Age to this period. At this time the seas were easier to travel than Europe&#x27;s inland forests, and the wild buffer regions that separated the kingdoms of the time were known as marches.

=== Voyages to foreign countries ===

The Swedes took part in many Western raids against England alongside the Danes and Norwegians of which many successfully acquired Danegeld as seen on the England Runestones. The Swedes were also very active traders and raiders in the eastern and southeastern parts of Europe. The large Russian mainland and its many navigable rivers offered good prospects for trading and plundering. These routes brought them into contact with the Byzantine and Muslim empires. The former led, among other things, to the formation of the Varangian Guard, an elite fighting force made up by Norsemen. The scholarly consensus is that the Rus&#x27; people originated in what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as Roslagen in Sweden (with the older name being &quot;Roden&quot;).

During the 9th century, extensive Scandinavian settlements were made on the east side of the Baltic Sea. The &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; (dated to 1113) tells of how the Varangians arrived in Constantinople, and of pirate expeditions on the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.

The Varangians accumulated great wealth from their foreign trades. A centre of trade in northern Europe developed on the island of Birka, not far from where Stockholm was later constructed, in mid-latitude Sweden. Birka declined drastically by 960, but archaeological finds indicate it was wealthy in the 9th and 10th centuries. Thousands of graves, coins, jewelry and other luxury items have been found there.

=== Early rulers ===
Medieval Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon sources tell of Migration Age Swedish kings belonging to the Scylfing dynasty, also known as Ynglings. Some sources, such as &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; trace the foundation of the Swedish kingdom back to the last centuries BC. Some of these sources, the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Widsith&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot;, may date to the 8th century in their present forms, but retain oral traditions that are considerably older. Native Scandinavian sources are generally held to date no earlier than the 9th century in the form of skaldic poetry, such as &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;. The Scandinavian sources were not put to paper until the 11th century and later.

In a mythological sense, the first king of Sweden is said to have been Odin as the founder of the house of Yngling. (See also List of legendary kings of Sweden.)

The earliest kings whose names appear in different traditions (&quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;) are three kings from the 6th century, starting with Ongentheow or Egil. The first kings attested in a contemporary source are those mentioned in Rimbert&#x27;s &quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot;, from the 9th century.

Before the 10th or 11th century, there were many different petty kings, who ruled over different parts of the future Sweden and a lot of fighting and disputes between different tribes, such as the Geats and Swedes, and different sources contradict each other. These contradictions persists up to and after the reign of Eric the Victorious, who ruled around 970–995, but some facts about him can be established. Eric was succeeded by his son King Olof Skötkonung (late 960s), the first Christian king of Sweden, and the first who is known to have ruled over the different tribes. Olof is listed first in medieval Swedish regnal lists, but modern ones usually starts with his father.

== Middle Ages ==

=== Christianization ===
During and before the Early Viking Age, the people in what is now Sweden were primarily believers in Norse mythology, which dominated most of southern Scandinavia. Swedes had contact with Christianity from their early travels. Christian influence on burials can be traced to the late 8th century in some parts of Sweden. Additionally, Irish missionary monks were most likely active in some parts of Sweden, as demonstrated by Irish saints that were honored in the Middle Ages. Sweden is traditionally considered to be the last country out of Sweden, Denmark and Norway to adopt Christianity and held on to their pagan beliefs the longest, with rulers such as Blot-Sweyn.

From the Holy Roman Empire, the monk Ansgar (801–865) began the earliest campaign to introduce Christianity to Sweden. Ansgar made his first visit to Birka in 829, was granted permission to build a church, and stayed as a missionary until 831. He then returned home and became Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Around 850, he returned to Birka, where he saw that the previous congregation had faded away. Ansgar tried to re-establish it, but it only lasted a few years. However, archaeological digs in Varnhem found a Christian burial ground established in the late 9th century. On the same spot, a stone church was built in the early-11th century, and a short distance away, Varnhem Abbey was established in the 12th century.
When Emund the Old ascended to the throne, around 1050, he had converted to Christianity. But because of his quarrels with Adalhard, Archbishop of Bremen, independence of the Church of Sweden was not obtained for another century. A decade later, in 1060, King Stenkil ascended to the throne. At the time, Christianity was firmly established throughout most of Sweden, with its chief strength in Västergötland. However, the people of Uppland, with their centre in Uppsala, still held to their original (heathen) faith. Adalhard had succeeded in destroying the idols in Västergötland, but was unable to persuade Stenkil to destroy the ancient Temple of Uppsala.

There are large gaps in the knowledge of the earliest Swedish regents. However, the last king who followed the old Norse religion was Blot-Sweyn, who reigned 1084–87. According to legend, Blot-Sweyn became king when his predecessor Inge refused to sacrifice at Uppsala. His brother-in-law Sweyn stepped up and agreed to sacrifice, which gave him the nickname &quot;Blot&quot;, which means &quot;sacrifice&quot;. Inge took out his revenge three years later, when he entered Uppsala with a great force, set Blot-Sweyn&#x27;s house ablaze, and killed him as he attempted to flee the burning wreckage.

It was not until Eric the Saint (1150–60) that the Church of Sweden was to be organized on the medieval model. According to a late-13th-century legend, Erik undertook the so-called First Swedish Crusade to Finland together with the equally legendary Bishop Henry of Uppsala, conquering the country and building many churches there. No historical record remains of the alleged crusade.

After the introduction of Christianity the importance of Uppsala began to decline steadily, and the kings no longer made it their residence. It was made the seat for the Swedish Archbishop in 1164. A cathedral was built on the place for the old Temple of Uppsala. One of the first to be consecrated there was the Swedish King Eric the Saint.

=== Consolidation ===

In the 11th and 12th centuries, the sources state how Sweden more or less consisted of self-governing provinces. It is established that Olof Skötkonung was king of Svealand and at least parts of Götaland, but it is uncertain whether his realm extended to include all of it. And after Olof, the reign of the country was on several occasions divided between different rulers.
King Sverker I of Sweden (1134–55) is said to have permanently integrated Götaland and Svealand.

The following centuries saw rivalry between two houses: the House of Sverker in the Östergötland province, and the House of Eric in the Västergötland province.
=== 13th century ===

The greatest medieval statesman of Sweden, and one of the principal architects of its rise as a nation, Birger Jarl the Regent, practically ruled the land from 1248 to 1266. He is today revered as the founder of Stockholm and as the creator of national legislation. His reforms paved the way for the abolition of serfdom. The increased respect and power which later royals owed to Birger Jarl were further extended by his son, King Magnus Ladulås (1275–90). Both these rulers, by the institution of separate and almost independent duchies, attempted to introduce into Sweden a feudal system similar to that already established in continental Europe; the danger of thus weakening the realm by partition was averted, though not without violent and tragic complications by the opponents, the Folkung party. Finally, in 1319, the severed portions of Sweden were once more reunited.
The formation of separate orders (classes of society), or estates, was promoted by Magnus Ladulås, who extended the privileges of the clergy and practically founded the formal Swedish nobility (see Ordinance of Alsnö, 1280). Founded with this institution was a heavily armed cavalry, the kernel of the national army. The Knights (new nobles) and Burghers became distinguishable from the higher nobility. This period saw the rise of a prominent burgess class, as the towns now began to acquire charters. At the end of the 13th century, and the beginning of the 14th, provincial codes of laws appear and the king and his council also executed legislative and judicial functions.

Although Swedish-speaking culture had been expanding eastwards through Åland and along what are now the coastal regions of Finland for several centuries, the Second Swedish Crusade, undertaken by Birger Jarl in the late 1230s or late 1240s, is generally perceived as the period when the region now called Finland was incorporated into the Swedish state. This region remained an integral part of Sweden until 1809, governed from the city of Åbo (Finnish: Turku).

=== Union between Sweden and Norway ===

The first union between Sweden and Norway occurred in 1319 when the three-year-old Magnus, son of the Swedish royal Duke Eric and of the Norwegian princess Ingeborg, inherited the throne of Norway from his grandfather Haakon V and in the same year was elected King of Sweden, by the Convention of Oslo. The boy king&#x27;s long minority weakened the royal influence in both countries, and Magnus lost both his kingdoms before his death. In Sweden, Magnus&#x27; partialities and necessities led directly to the rise of a powerful landed aristocracy, and, indirectly, to the growth of popular liberties. Forced by the incompetence of the magnates to lean upon the middle classes, in 1359 the king summoned the first Swedish Riksdag, on which occasion representatives from the towns were invited to appear along with the nobles and clergy. The Swedes, irritated by Magnus&#x27; misrule, replaced him with his nephew, Albert of Mecklenburg in 1365. Albert was forced to take the first coronation oath in 1371, in which Albert swore to concede many of his powers to the nobility in the Regency Council.

=== Kalmar Union ===
In 1388, at the request of the Swedes, Albert was driven out by Margaret I of Denmark and at a convention of the representatives of the three Scandinavian kingdoms (held at Kalmar in 1397), Margaret&#x27;s great-nephew, Eric of Pomerania, was elected the common king, although the liberties of each of the three realms were expressly reserved and confirmed. The union was to be a personal, not a political union. Neither Margaret nor her successors observed the stipulation that in each of the three kingdoms only natives should hold land and high office, and the efforts first of Denmark (at that time by far the strongest member of the union) to impose her will on the Union&#x27;s weaker kingdoms soon produced secessions. The Swedes first broke away from the Union in 1434 under the popular leader Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson, and after his murder they elected Karl Knutsson Bonde as their king with the title of Charles VIII in 1436. In 1441 Charles VIII had to abdicate in favour of Christopher of Bavaria, who was already king of Denmark and Norway; however, upon the death of Christopher in 1448, a state of confusion ensued in the course of which Charles VIII was twice reinstated and twice expelled again. Finally, on his death in 1470, the three kingdoms were reunited under Christian II of Denmark, the prelates and higher nobility of Sweden favouring the union.

<text>Confession, in many religions, is the acknowledgment of sinful thoughts and actions. This is performed directly to a deity or to fellow people.

It is often seen as a required action of repentance and a necessary precursor to penance and atonement. It often leads to reconciliation and forgiveness.

==Christianity==
===Roman Catholicism===
In Catholic Christian teaching, the Sacrament of Penance is the method by which individuals confess any sins they have committed after their baptism; these sins are then absolved by God through the administration of a priest, who assigns an act of penance. To validly receive absolution, the penitent must make a sincere sacramental confession of all known mortal sins not yet confessed to a priest and pray an act of contrition (a genre of prayers) that expresses both motives for sorrow and the resolve not to sin again.

The Catholic rite, obligatory at least once a year for serious sins, is usually conducted within a confessional box, booth, or reconciliation room. This sacrament is known by many names, including penance, reconciliation, and confession. While official Church publications usually refer to the sacrament as &quot;penance&quot;, &quot;reconciliation&quot;, or &quot;penance and reconciliation&quot;, many clergy and laypeople continue to use the term &quot;confession&quot; when referring to the sacrament.

For the Catholic Church, the sacrament intends to provide healing for the soul as well as to regain the grace of God, lost by sin. In Catholic teaching, a perfect act of contrition – where the penitent expresses sorrow for having offended God and not out of fear of eternal punishment – removes the eternal punishment associated with mortal sin, even outside of confession. However, Catholics must confess their mortal sins within confession at the earliest opportunity. In theological terms, the priest acts and receives from the Church the power of jurisdiction over the penitent. The Council of Trent (Session Fourteen, Chapter I) quoted John 20:22–23 as the primary Scriptural proof for the doctrine concerning the sacrament. Catholics also consider Matthew 18:18, describing the power to &quot;bind&quot; and to &quot;loose&quot;, to be among the Scriptural bases for the sacrament.

The Catholic Church teaches that sacramental confession requires three &quot;acts&quot; on the part of the penitent: contrition (sorrow of the soul for the sins committed), disclosure of the sins (the &#x27;confession&#x27;), and satisfaction (the &#x27;penance&#x27;; i.e., doing something to make amends for the sins). The basic form of confession has not changed for centuries, although at one time, confessions were made publicly. The concept of confessing in private is called , which comes from Hellenistic and later Roman mythology and was eventually adopted into Christian symbolism.

Typically, the penitent begins sacramental confession by saying, &quot;Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been [time period] since my last confession.&quot; The penitent must then confess what they believe to be grave and mortal sins, in both kind and number, to be reconciled with God and the Church. The sinner may also confess venial sins; this is especially recommended if the penitent has no mortal sins to confess. According to the &quot;Catechism&quot;, &quot;without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday faults (venial sins) is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church. Indeed, the regular confession of our venial sins helps us form our conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be healed by Christ, and progress in the life of the Spirit.&quot; &quot;When Christ&#x27;s faithful strive to confess all the sins they can remember, they undoubtedly place all of them before the divine mercy for pardon.&quot;

The Catholic Church teaches, based on the Parable of the Prodigal Son, that confession is not a tribunal or criminal court, where one is condemned by God like a criminal, but a &quot;wedding banquet hall, where the community celebrates Easter, Christ&#x27;s victory over sin and death, in the joyful experience of his forgiving mercy.&quot; In confession, the church believes God judges a person in the sense of bringing to light their sins by granting the person the ability to confess their sins to the confessor, then grants the person repentance and, through the confessor, grants the person forgiveness. God&#x27;s forgiveness restores the person to &quot;the brightness of the white robe of baptism, a garment specifically required to participate in the [wedding] feast.&quot;

In Catholicism, it is considered the duty of priests not to reveal anything learned during the Sacrament of Penance; this protection against disclosure is known as the Seal of Confession.

===Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Eastern Rite Catholicism ===
Orthodox Christians as well as members of the Assyrian Church of the East and Eastern Rite Catholics choose an individual to trust as their earthly guide to help them grow in Christ. In most cases, this is the parish priest, but may also be a starets (Elder, a monastic who is well known for their advancement in the spiritual life). This person is often referred to as one&#x27;s &quot;spiritual father&quot;. Once chosen, the individual turns to their spiritual guide for advice on their spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice. Orthodox Christians tend to formally confess only to this individual, with their spiritual guide assisting them with their growth in Christ and through Theosis. The bond between an Orthodox Christian and their spiritual father is so deep that no legal official can override a spiritual guide in criminal cases. What is confessed to one&#x27;s spiritual guide is protected by the same seal as would be any priest hearing a confession. Only an ordained priest may pronounce the absolution.

Confession does not take place in a confessional, but normally in the main part of the church itself, usually before an analogion (lectern) set up near the iconostasion. On the analogion is placed a Gospel Book and a blessing cross. The confession often takes place before an icon of Jesus Christ. Orthodox Christians understand that during Confession, forgiveness is not bestowed by the priest, but by Christ. The priest stands only as a witness and vessel to be used by God. Before confessing, the penitent venerates the Gospel Book and blessing cross and places the thumb and first two fingers of his right hand on the feet of Christ as depicted on the cross. The confessor will often read an admonition warning the penitent to make a full confession, holding nothing back.

As with administration of other sacraments, in cases of emergency confession may be heard anywhere. For this reason, especially in the Russian Orthodox Church, the pectoral cross that the priest wears at all times will often have the Icon of Christ &quot;Not Made by Hands&quot; inscribed on it so that such an icon will be available to penitents who are experiencing imminent death or life-threatening danger in the presence of a priest but away from a church.

In general practice, after one confesses to one&#x27;s spiritual guide, the parish priest (who may or may not have heard the confession) covers the head of the person with his Epitrachelion (Stole) and reads the Prayer of Absolution, asking God to forgive the transgression of the individual (the specific prayer differs between Greek and Slavic use). It is not uncommon for a person to confess their sins to their spiritual guide on a regular basis but only seek out the priest to read the prayer before receiving Holy Communion.

In the Eastern Churches, clergy often make their confession in the sanctuary. A bishop, priest, or deacon will confess at the Holy Table (Altar) where the Gospel Book and blessing cross are normally kept. He confesses in the same manner as a layman, except that when a priest hears a bishop&#x27;s confession, the priest kneels.

There are many different practices regarding how often Orthodox Christians should go to confession. Some Patriarchates advise confession before each reception of Holy Communion, others advise confessing during each of the four fasting periods (Great Lent, Nativity Fast, Apostles&#x27; Fast and Dormition Fast), and there are many additional variants. Many pastors encourage frequent confession and communion. In some of the monasteries on Mount Athos, the monks will confess their sins daily.

Eastern Christians also continue to practice a form of general confession, (or manifest contrition), referred to as the rite of &quot;Mutual Forgiveness&quot;. This rite involves an exchange between the priest and the congregation (or, in monasteries, between the superior and the brotherhood). The priest will make a prostration before all and ask their forgiveness for sins committed in act, word, deed, and thought. Those present ask that God may forgive them, and then they in turn all prostrate themselves and ask the priest&#x27;s forgiveness. The priest then pronounces a blessing. The rite of Mutual Forgiveness does not replace the Mystery of Confession and Absolution, but is for the purpose of maintaining Christian charity and a humble and contrite spirit. This general confession is practiced in monasteries at the first service on arising (the Midnight Office) and the last service before retiring to sleep (Compline). Old Believers will perform the rite regularly before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy. The best-known asking of mutual forgiveness occurs at Vespers on the Sunday of Forgiveness, and it is with this act that Great Lent begins.

===Lutheranism===

Lutherans differ from other Protestants as they practice &quot;confession and absolution&quot; (in two forms). They, like Roman Catholics and many Anglicans, see James 5:16 and John 20:22–23 as biblical evidence for confession.

The first form of confession and absolution is done at the Divine Service with the assembled congregation. Here, the entire congregation pauses for a moment of silent confession, recites the &quot;confiteor&quot;, and receives God&#x27;s forgiveness through the pastor as he says the following (or similar): &quot;Upon this your confession and in the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ, I forgive you all your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

The second form of confession and absolution is known as &quot;Holy Absolution&quot;, which is done privately to the pastor (commonly only upon request). Here the person confessing (known as the &quot;penitent&quot;) confesses individually their sins and makes an act of contrition as the pastor, acting in persona Christi, announces this following formula of absolution (or similar): &quot;In the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ I forgive you all your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; In the Lutheran Church, the pastor is bound by the Seal of the Confessional (similar to the Roman Catholic tradition). Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism says &quot;the pastor is pledged not to tell anyone else of sins to him in private confession, for those sins have been removed.

At the present time, Confession and Absolution is expected before partaking of the Eucharist for the first time. Confession and Absolution has historically been scheduled on Saturdays (after vespers), in preparation for Mass on the Lord&#x27;s Day (though it may be held on any day of the week depending on the individual Lutheran parish).

=== Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist ===
In the Reformed tradition (which includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist denominations), corporate confession is the normative way that confession and absolution is practiced. The Order of Worship in the Bible Presbyterian Church, for example, enjoins the following:
 Many Reformed, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches (including the Church of Scotland, Presbyterian Church (USA) and Presbyterian Church in America) practice Confession in the Divine Liturgy or Divine Worship on each Lord&#x27;s Day. The practices are found in the Book of Common Worship, the Book of Order and the Book of Common Order.

It may start usually with the following confessional prayer read in unison, followed by the Kyrie Eleison or Trisagion (Holy God, holy and mighty) and Agnus Dei (Lamb of God).

Following this, an Assurance of Pardon is spoken.

The Presbyterian Church (USA)&#x27;s Directory of Worship, in directing the components or worship, states: &quot;A prayer of confession of the reality of sin in personal and common life follows. In a declaration of pardon, the gospel is proclaimed and forgiveness is declared in the name of Jesus Christ. God&#x27;s redemption and God&#x27;s claim upon human life are remembered.&quot;

===Anabaptism===
Many Anabaptist denominations, including those of the Schwarzenau Brethren, Mennonite and Amish traditions, encourage confession to another or to the elders, and some denominations require such confession when a wrong has been done to a person as well as to God. Confession is then made to the person wronged and also to God, and is part of the reconciliation process. In cases where sin has resulted in the exclusion of a person from church membership due to unrepentance, public confession is often a prerequisite to readmission. The sinner confesses to the church their repentance and is received back into fellowship. In both cases there is a required manner to the confessions: for sins between God and man and for sins between man and man. Confession in the Anabaptist tradition is done in the humble posture of kneeling.

===Anglicanism===
In the Anglican tradition, confession and absolution is usually a component part of corporate worship, particularly at the Eucharist (as with Lutheranism). The form involves an exhortation to repentance by the priest, a period of silent prayer during which believers may inwardly confess their sins, a form of general confession said together by all present and the pronouncement of general absolution by the priest, often accompanied by the sign of the cross.

Private or auricular confession is also practiced by Anglicans and is especially common among Anglo-Catholics. The venue for confessions is either in the traditional confessional, which is the common practice among Anglo-Catholics, or in a private meeting with the priest. Often a priest will sit in the sanctuary, just inside the communion rail, facing toward the altar and away from the penitent. Other times they will use a portable screen to divide themselves and the penitent. Following the confession of sins and the assignment of penance, the priest makes the pronouncement of absolution. The seal of the confessional, as with Roman Catholicism, is absolute and any confessor who divulges information revealed in confession is subject to deposition and removal from office.

Historically, the practice of auricular confession was highly controversial within Anglicanism. When priests began to hear confessions, they responded to criticisms by pointing to the fact that such is explicitly sanctioned in &quot;The Order for the Visitation of the Sick&quot; in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which contains the following direction: 

Auricular confession within mainstream Anglicanism became accepted in the second half of the 20th century; the 1979 Book of Common Prayer for the Episcopal Church in the US provides two forms for it in the section &quot;The Reconciliation of a Penitent&quot;.

Private confession is also envisaged by the canon law of the Church of England, which contains the following, intended to safeguard the seal of the confessional:

There is no requirement for private confession, but a common understanding that it may be desirable depending on individual circumstances. An Anglican aphorism regarding the practice is &quot;All may; none must; some should&quot;.

Private confession of sins to a priest, followed by absolution, has always been provided for in the Book of Common Prayer. In the Communion Service of the 1662 English Prayer Book, for example, we read:

The status of confession as lesser sacrament than Baptism and Communion is stated in Anglican formularies, such as the Thirty-Nine Articles. Article XXV includes it among &quot;Those five commonly called Sacraments&quot; which &quot;are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel[...] for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.&quot; In the view of some theologians, &quot;commonly called Sacraments&quot; does not mean &quot;wrongly called Sacraments;&quot; and that the Article merely distinguishes confession and the other rites from the two great Sacraments of the Gospel.

Until the Prayer Book revisions of the 1970s and the creation of Alternative Service Books in various Anglican provinces, the penitential rite was always part of larger services. Prior to the revision, private confessions would be according to the form of Ministry to the Sick. The form of absolution provided in the order for the Visitation of the Sick reads, &quot;Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.&quot;

Despite the provision for private confession in every edition of the Book of Common Prayer, the practice was frequently contested during the Ritualist controversies of the later nineteenth century.

===Methodism===
In the Methodist Church, as with the Anglican Communion, penance is defined by the Articles of Religion as one those &quot;Commonly called Sacraments but not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel&quot;, also known as the &quot;five lesser sacraments&quot;. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, held &quot;the validity of Anglican practice in his day as reflected in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;&quot;, stating that &quot;We grant confession to men to be in many cases of use: public, in case of public scandal; private, to a spiritual guide for disburdening of the conscience, and as a help to repentance.&quot; Additionally, per the recommendation of John Wesley, Methodist class meetings traditionally meet weekly in order to confess sins to one another.

&quot;The Book of Worship of The United Methodist Church&quot; contains the rite for private confession and absolution in &quot;A Service of Healing II&quot;, in which the minister pronounces the words &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ, you are forgiven!&quot;; some Methodist churches have regularly scheduled auricular confession and absolution, while others make it available upon request. Near the time of death, many Methodists confess their sins and receive absolution from an ordained minister, in addition to being anointed. Since Methodism holds the office of the keys to &quot;belong to all baptized persons&quot;, private confession does not necessarily need to be made to a pastor, and therefore lay confession is permitted, although this is not the norm.

In the Methodist tradition, corporate confession is the most common practice, with the Methodist liturgy including &quot;prayers of confession, assurance and pardon&quot;. The traditional confession of &quot;The Sunday Service&quot;, the first liturgical text used by Methodists, comes from the service of Morning Prayer in &quot;The Book of Common Prayer&quot;. 

The confession of one&#x27;s sin is particularly important before receiving Holy Communion; the official United Methodist publication about the Eucharist titled &quot;This Holy Mystery&quot; states that:

In Methodism, the minister is bound by the Seal of the Confessional, with &quot;The Book of Discipline&quot; stating &quot;All clergy of The United Methodist Church are charged to maintain all confidences inviolate, including confessional confidences&quot;; any confessor who divulges information revealed in confession is subject to being defrocked in accordance with canon law.

The &quot;Book of Offices and Services&quot; of the Order of Saint Luke, a Methodist religious order, contains a corporate &quot;Service of Prayer for Reconciliation&quot; in addition to a &quot;Rite of Reconciliation for Individual Persons&quot;.

Many Methodists, like other Protestants, regularly practice confession of their sin to God himself, holding that &quot;When we do confess, our fellowship with the Father is restored. He extends His parental forgiveness. He cleanses us of all unrighteousness, thus removing the consequences of the previously unconfessed sin. We are back on track to realise the best plan that He has for our lives.&quot;

===Irvingism===
In the Irvingian Churches, such as the New Apostolic Church, persons may confess their sins to an Apostle. The Apostle is then able to &quot;take the confession and proclaim absolution&quot;. A seal of confession ensures that confidentiality between the Apostle and Penitent is maintained. In cases of grave urgency, any priestly minister can hear confessions and pronounce absolutions. Auricular confession is not necessary for forgiveness, but it may provide peace if a believer feels burdened.

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that &quot;confession is a necessary requirement for complete forgiveness.&quot; Such confessions take place in worthiness interviews prior to baptism into the church, to being set apart for any church callings, or to receiving yearly temple recommends.

Within confession, the sinner must confess both to God and to those persons wronged by the sin. Confession may also be required to an authorized priesthood leader, such as a bishop, branch president, stake president, or mission president. Although there is no definitive list of sins that require confession to a priesthood leader, &quot;adultery, fornication, other sexual transgressions and deviancies, and sins of a comparable seriousness&quot; are included, as is intentional and repeated use of pornography. Depending on the seriousness of the sin, the priesthood leader may counsel the sinner to submit to the authority of a disciplinary council, but does not have the authority to forgive sin, which can come only from God. The confession to the priesthood leader must be held in strict confidence unless the confessor grants permission to disclose it to the disciplinary council. The LDS Church rejects the belief that confession is all that is required to secure repentance from God.
==Hinduism==

In Hinduism, confession is part of , a -related term and refers to voluntarily accepting one&#x27;s errors and misdeeds, confession, repentance, means of penance and expiation to undo or reduce the karmic consequences. It includes atonement for intentional and unintentional misdeeds. The ancient Hindu literature on repentance, expiation and atonement is extensive, with earliest mentions found in the Vedic literature. Illustrative means to repent for intentional and unintentional misdeeds include admitting one&#x27;s misdeeds, austerities, fasting, pilgrimage and bathing in sacred waters, ascetic lifestyle, (fire sacrifice, ), praying, yoga, giving gifts to the poor and needy, and others.

Those texts that discuss , states Robert Lingat, debate the intent and thought behind the improper act, and consider penance appropriate when the &quot;effect&quot; had to be balanced, but &quot;cause&quot; was unclear.

== Islam ==

The act of seeking forgiveness from God for sins is called . Confession of sins is made directly to God and not through man; the only exception is when confessing to a person is a required step in recompensing for the damage done. It is taught that sins are to be kept to oneself to seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit themselves not to repeat the sin. Typically, a Muslim will pray to God for forgiveness and promises that they will be careful not to commit the same mistake/sin ever again.

==Alcoholics Anonymous==
In the AA Twelve-Step Program, confession is made in Step 5: &quot;Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.&quot;

&quot;If we decline to follow through with this step, our un-confessed sins will haunt us, resulting in the demise of our body and spirit. We will have to continue paying the penalty of our wrongdoings.&quot;

&quot;By completing the Fifth Step, we gain God&#x27;s forgiveness, supervision, and strength. We obtain complete forgiveness...&quot;

==Judaism==

In Judaism, confession is an important part of attaining forgiveness for both sins against God and another man. Confessions to God are done communally in the plural. During Yom Kippur service, Jews confess that &quot; have sinned.&quot; In matters involving offenses against a fellow man, private confession to the victim is a requirement to obtaining forgiveness from the victim, which is generally a requirement to obtaining forgiveness from God. If the victim refuses to forgive, the offender confesses publicly, before larger and larger audiences. Confession () is also performed on one&#x27;s deathbed, if at all possible.

In pre-rabbinic Judaism, sacrifices were an important part of atonement.

==Buddhism==
Buddhism has been from its inception primarily a tradition of renunciation and monasticism. Within the monastic framework (called the Vinaya) of the sangha regular of wrongdoing to other monks is mandatory. In the suttas of the Pali Canon Bhikkhus sometimes even confessed their wrongdoing to the Buddha himself. That part of the Pali Canon called the Vinaya requires that monks confess their individual sins before the bi-weekly convening for the recitation of the Patimokkha.

<doc id="217475" wikidata="Q1989603" url="?curid=217475" title="Pleione (plant)">
<text>Pleione is a small genus of predominantly terrestrial but sometimes epiphytic or lithophytic, miniature orchids. This genus is named after Pleione, mother of the Pleiades (in Greek mythology), and comprises about 20 species. Common names of this genus include peacock orchid, glory of the east, Himalayan crocus, Indian crocus and windowsill orchid. The genus &quot;Diploconchium&quot; is generally included here. &quot;Pleione&quot; is abbreviated to Pln in trade journals.

==Name==
&quot;Pleione&quot; is named after the water-nymph Pleione of Greek mythology.

== Growth ==

The sympodial growth habit of terrestrial &quot;Pleione&quot; orchids is unusual. They have relatively large, spongy, almost globular or ampulliform pseudobulbs, narrowed at the apex. Every pseudobulb is only active for one year and carries one or two pleated parallel-veined leaves, with a length of . These drop off before winter. The pseudobulb stays dormant, till a new one starts to develop. This one produces new roots and a short pedicel. This pseudobulb remains active till the end of the bloom. Then the whole cycle starts all over again.

The big, showy flowers originate from new shoots formed at the base of the pseudobulb. They are pink to purplish, white or yellow, while the fringed, tubular lip is often paler or white, with yellow, red or purple dots and stripes. The flowers of the mountain species start blooming in spring, while the new shoots develop. The flowers of the orchids, growing in warmer climates, bloom in autumn, when the leaves have dropped.

They are very closely related to the genus &quot;Coelogyne&quot; and were once considered part of it.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Pleione&quot; is distributed in the mountains and foothills of the Himalayas, India, Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China. The species are well adapted to cold temperatures and even frost. A few, however, prefer warmer temperatures. They grow in well-drained habitats and on rocks covered with moss at altitudes of .

=== Natural hybrids ===
*&quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;christianii&quot; (&quot;P. yunnanensis&quot; × &quot;P. forrestii&quot;) (China – W. Yunnan).
*&quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;confusa&quot; (&quot;P. albiflora&quot; × &quot;P. forrestii&quot;) (China – W. Yunnan).
*&quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;kohlsii&quot; (&quot;P. aurita&quot; × &quot;P. forrestii&quot;) (China – W. Yunnan).
*&quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;lagenaria&quot; (&quot;P. maculata&quot; × &quot;P. praecox&quot;) (Assam to China – W. Yunnan).
*&quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;taliensis&quot; (&quot;P. bulbocodioides&quot; × &quot;P. yunnanensis&quot;) (China – W. Yunnan).

== Taxonomy ==
It has been suggested that &quot;P. bulbocodioides&quot;, &quot;P. limprichtii&quot; and &quot;P. pleionoides&quot; could all be the same species.

Currently, there are two sections in the genus &quot;Pleione&quot;:
* section Pleione (includes the autumn-flowered species): &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;lagenaria&quot;, &quot;P. maculata&quot;, &quot;P. praecox&quot;, &quot;P. saxicola&quot;
* section Humiles (includes the spring-flowering species): &quot;P. albiflora&quot;, &quot;P. bulbocodioides&quot;, &quot;P. chunii&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;confusa&quot;, &quot;P. coronaria&quot;, &quot;P. formosana&quot;, &quot;P. forrestii&quot;, &quot;P. grandiflora&quot;, &quot;P. hookeriana&quot;, &quot;P. praecox&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; × &quot;kohlsii&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; &quot;limprichtii&quot;, &quot;P. pleionoides&quot;, &quot;P. scopulorum&quot;, &quot;P. yunnanensis&quot;

== Cultivation ==
They are easily grown by the layman, easy to propagate and are among the most popular orchids. They are much in demand for hybridization. Numerous garden hybrids have been produced, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:- 
*&quot;Pleione&quot; Shantung grex &#x27;Muriel Harberd&#x27; 
=== Nothogenera ===
Hybrids of &quot;Pleione&quot; with other genera are placed in the following nothogenera:
* &quot;Pleionilla&quot; (&quot;Plnl.&quot;) = &quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;Bletilla&quot;
* &quot;Coeleione&quot; (&quot;Coeln.&quot;) = &quot;Pleione&quot; × &quot;Coelogyne&quot;

<doc id="217476" wikidata="Q5163321" url="?curid=217476" title="Consolidation of Sweden">
<text>The consolidation of Sweden involved an extensive process during which the loosely organized social system consolidated under the power of the king. The actual age of the Swedish kingdom is unknown. Also, for various reasons, scholars differ in defining early Sweden as either a country, state or kingdom.

There is no agreement on a reliable date for a unified Sweden. Historians judge differently the sources for the history of Sweden&#x27;s consolidation. The earliest history blends with Norse mythology. Early primary sources are foreign; secondary sources were written at a later date.

== Older sources ==
Based on the origins of the name of the kingdom as meaning (Kingdom of the Swedes), some historians have argued that Sweden was unified when the Swedes first solidified their control over the regions they were living in. The earliest date for this is based on a brief section in the Roman historian Tacitus discussing the Suiones tribe. 
This would imply that a Swedish kingdom would have existed in the first to second centuries AD. However, with the increased rigour of historical method advanced in 20th century historical research, in Sweden as elsewhere, historians such as Curt Weibull and his brother Lauritz maintained that these perspectives have become obsolete. Modern historians noted that a millennium had passed between Tacitus and more in-depth and reliable documented accounts (or notices of contemporary events relating to Sweden by Frankish and German writers) of Swedish history. The work of Birger Nerman (1925), who argued that Sweden held a senior rank among the existing European states at the time represents a nationalist reaction to the academic historiography, with the latter taking a critical or cautious view of the value of old layers of sources of history especially if these documents and traditions are unsupported by any direct traces, any footprint of events and social or political conditions in the archaeological records, buildings, coinage etc. of the age in question.

== Geats-Swedes arguments ==
The names Swedes and Geats are attested in the Old English poems &quot;Beowulf&quot; (written down in the 11th century) and &quot;Widsith&quot; (from the 8th century) and building on older legendary and folklore material collected in England. In both poems, an Ongentheow (corresponding to &quot;Angantyr&quot; in Icelandic sagas) is named as the King of the Swedes, and the Geats are mentioned as a separate people. These names of peoples living in present-day Sweden, the Anglo-Saxon references and now lost tales they were attached to must have travelled across the North Sea. The first time the two peoples are documented to have had a common ruler is during the reign of Olof Skötkonung about AD 1000.

== Timeframe arguments ==
Rather than the unification of tribes under one king, others maintain that the process of consolidation was gradual. Nineteenth-century scholars saw the unification as a result of a series of wars based on evidence from the Norse sagas. For example, according to the Norwegian &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; and the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturlusson, a 7th-century king called Ingjald illråde burnt a number of subordinate kings to death inside his hall, thus abolishing the petty kingdoms in the consolidation of Sweden.

According to Sverre Bagge, unification in Sweden centered on controlling the areas around the major lakes in Sweden.

<text>David Holmes (March 10, 1769August 20, 1832) was an American politician in Virginia and Mississippi. He served five terms as a U.S. congressman from Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and later was important in Mississippi&#x27;s development as a state. The federal government appointed him as the fourth and last governor of the Mississippi Territory. In 1817, he was unanimously elected as the first governor of the state of Mississippi. He served a term as U.S. senator from Mississippi, appointed to fill a vacancy until elected by the legislature. Elected again as governor, he was forced to resign early due to ill health. He returned to Virginia in his last years.

==Career==
Born near Hanover in York County, Province of Pennsylvania, Holmes, as a child, moved with his family to Frederick County, Virginia. He attended Winchester Academy, ultimately studying law and passing the bar. He started his practice in Harrisonburg, Virginia. By adulthood, he considered himself a Virginian. He served as U.S. Representative from Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, serving a total of five terms from 1797 until 1809, as he was repeatedly re-elected.

===Electoral history===
*1797; Holmes was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, with 60.4% of the vote, defeating Democratic-Republican John Bowyer and Federalist John Steele.
*1799; Holmes was re-elected with 83.56% of the vote, defeating Federalist Robert Porterfield.
*1801; Holmes was re-elected over Federalist Alexander Sinclair.
*1803; Holmes was re-elected with 70.39% of the vote, defeating Federalist Isaac Van Meter.
*1805; Holmes was re-elected unopposed.
*1807; Holmes was re-elected unopposed.

==Mississippi Territory==
President Thomas Jefferson appointed Holmes as the fourth governor of the Mississippi Territory. Holmes was very popular, and his appointment marked the end of a long period of political factionalism within the territory. European Americans were pressing to gain more land and encroaching on Native American territory of the Chickasaw and Choctaw people.

Holmes was the last governor of the Mississippi Territory, serving from 1809 to 1817. He was generally successful in dealing with a variety of matters, including expansion, land policy, Indians, the War of 1812, and the constitutional convention of 1817 (of which he was elected president).

Often concerned with problems regarding West Florida, he had a significant role in 1810 in negotiations that led to the peaceful occupation by the United States of part of that territory. McCain (1967) concludes that Holmes&#x27;s success was not based on brilliance but upon kindness, unselfishness, persuasiveness, courage, honesty, diplomacy, and intelligence.

==Mississippi statehood==
In 1817, Mississippi joined the United States as the 20th state. Holmes was elected unanimously as the first governor of the State of Mississippi. He took the oath of office in October 1817. However, Mississippi did not officially become a state until December. He established the state judicial system and the state militia during his term. He also organized the land east of the Pearl River, which the Choctaw people had ceded to the United States under considerable pressure.

In 1820, he was appointed as a Democratic-Republican to fill the US Senate vacancy from Mississippi caused by the resignation of Walter Leake. He was elected the same year by the state legislature (as was the practice then) as a Jackson Republican in August 1820, serving from 1821 until late 1825, when he ran in the gubernatorial campaign and was elected to another term as governor. He resigned as senator. Due to his declining health, he was able to serve only six months as Mississippi&#x27;s fifth governor. If both territory and statehood years are counted, he is Mississippi&#x27;s longest-serving governor, at over 11 years of service (10 years, 9 months, 29 days the first tenure; and 6 months, 18 days the second tenure).

Holmes returned to near Winchester, Virginia, where his health failed. He died in 1832 at Jordan White Sulphur Springs resort. He was buried in the Mt. Hebron Cemetery in Winchester. He was predeceased by his brother, Major Andrew Hunter Holmes, a casualty of the Battle of Mackinac Island during the War of 1812.

==Legacy==
Holmes County, Mississippi, is named in honor of him.

Holmes Avenue in Huntsville, Alabama was part of the Mississippi Territory when built and is named in honor of him.

<text>Penance is any act or a set of actions done out of repentance for sins committed, as well as an alternate name for the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox sacrament of Reconciliation or Confession.

The word &quot;penance&quot; derives from Old French and Latin &quot;paenitentia&quot;, both of which derive from the same root meaning repentance, a sincere change of heart and feeling of remorse (contrition). Penance and repentance, similar in their derivation and original sense, have come to represent conflicting views of the essence of repentance, arising from the controversy in the Protestant Reformation as to the respective merits of &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;good works&quot;.

According to dictionary definitions, the primary meaning of &quot;penance&quot; is the deeds done out of &quot;penitence&quot;. Like the latter, &quot;repentance&quot; refers to the genuine interior sorrow for one&#x27;s hurtful words or actions. Only repentance implies a purpose of amendment, the resolve to avoid such hurtful behavior in the future. The words &quot;true&quot; and &quot;firm&quot; might be added to all but &quot;penance,&quot; to specify the depth of change in one&#x27;s hurtful attitude. &quot;Contrition&quot; is the state of feeling remorseful, and can describe both the show of deepest regret and the firmest sorrow for one&#x27;s wrongdoings.

== Christianity ==

=== Penance as a religious attitude ===


Protestant Reformers, upholding the doctrine of justification by faith alone, held that repentance consisted in a change of the whole moral attitude of the mind and soul (Matthew 13:15; Luke 22:32), and that the divine forgiveness preceded true repentance and confession to God without any reparation of &quot;works&quot;. In his &quot;Of Justification By Faith&quot;, Calvin says: &quot;without forgiveness no man is pleasing to God.&quot; Nonetheless, in traditions formed by a Calvinist or Zwinglian sensibility, there has traditionally been a stress on reconciliation as a precondition to fellowship.
Typically in the non-Protestant view, the attitude of penance or repentance can also be externalized in acts that a believer imposes on themselves, acts that are called penances. Penitential activity is particularly common during the season of Lent and Holy Week. Advent is another season during which, to a lesser extent, penances are performed. Acts of self-discipline are used as tokens of repentance. Easier acts of self-discipline include devoting time to prayer or reading of the Bible or other spiritual books. Examples of harder acts of self-discipline are fasting, sexual continence, abstaining from alcohol or tobacco, or other privations: self-flagellation and the wearing of a cilice are rarely encountered in modern times. Such acts have sometimes been called mortification of the flesh, a phrase inspired by : &quot;If you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.&quot;

In some cultural traditions, Holy Week, which commemorates the Passion of Christ, may be marked by penances that include flagellantism or even voluntary pseudo-crucifixion which has been denounced by Philipino Catholics bishops as possible &quot;spiritual vanity.&quot;

The New Testament does not codify a ritual for repentance and reconciliation: baptism was practised and confession of sins to one another for the sake of healing is mentioned in the Epistle of James. With the delay of the expected Second Coming, there was a recognized need for a means of accepting back into the Christian community those who had been expelled for serious sins: in early Christianity, bishops declared that God had forgiven sins when it was clear that there was repentance, and the penitent was readmitted to the community. Today the act of penance or satisfaction imposed in connection with the sacrament for the same therapeutic purpose can consist of set prayers or a certain number of prostrations or an act or omission intended to reinforce what is positive in the penitent&#x27;s behaviour or to inhibit what is negative. The act imposed is itself called a penance or &quot;epitemia&quot;.

=== Penance as a sacrament or rite ===
====Catholicism====
The Catholic Church uses the term &quot;penance&quot; in a number of separate but related instances: (a) as a moral virtue, (b) as a sacrament, (c) as acts of satisfaction, and (d) as those specific acts of satisfaction assigned the penitent by the confessor in the context of the sacrament. These have as in common the concept that the person who sins must repent and as far as possible make reparation to divine justice.

=====A moral virtue=====
Penance is a moral virtue whereby the sinner is disposed to hatred of their sin as an offence against God and to a firm purpose of amendment and satisfaction. The principal act in the exercise of this virtue is the detestation of one&#x27;s own sins.

Penance, while a duty, is considered to be a gift in Catholicism, as it is held that no person can do any penance worthy of God&#x27;s consideration without God first giving the grace to do so. Penance proclaims mankind&#x27;s unworthiness in the face of God&#x27;s condescension, the indispensable disposition to God&#x27;s grace, for though sanctifying grace alone forgives and purges sins from the soul, it is necessary that the individual consent to this action of grace by the work of the virtue of penance. Penance helps to conquer sinful habits and builds generosity, humility and patience.

The motive of this detestation is that sins offend God. Theologians, following Thomas Aquinas (Summa III, Q. lxxxv, a. 1), regard penance as truly a virtue, though they have disagreed regarding its place among the virtues. Some have classed it with the virtue of charity, others with the virtue of religion, Bonaventure saw it as a part of the virtue of justice. Cajetan seems to have considered it as belonging to all three; however, most theologians agree with Aquinas that penance is a distinct virtue ().

=====Sacrament of Penance=====

In Catholic teaching, confession of sins is made to God and absolution is received from God: the priest who is the minister of the sacrament acts not in his own name but on behalf of God. In this sacrament, the sinner places themselves before the merciful judgment of God; this anticipates in a certain way, the merciful judgment to which they will be subjected at the end of their earthly life.

According to the Catholic Catechism, &quot;the process of repentance and conversion was described by Jesus in the parable of prodigal son.&quot; In the Catholic Church, the sacrament of penance (also called reconciliation, forgiveness, confession and conversion) is one of the two sacraments of healing: Jesus Christ has willed that by this means the church should continue, in the power of the Holy Spirit, his work of healing and salvation. Reconciliation with God is both the purpose and effect of this sacrament.

Essential to the sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution). among the penitent&#x27;s acts contrition holds first place. Serious sins (mortal sins) must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of venial sins also is recommended.

In locations or situations where priests are not available, people will make their own act of contrition direct to God in anticipation of the sacrament and deathbed confessions may if necessary be prayed with any suitable religious or layperson.

=====Assigned penance=====
The act of penance or satisfaction that the priest imposes helps the penitent to overcome selfishness, to desire more strongly to live a holy life, to be closer to Jesus, and to show to others the love and compassion of Jesus. It is part of the healing that the sacrament brings: &quot;Sin injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relations with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must &#x27;make satisfaction for&#x27; or &#x27;expiate&#x27; his sins.&quot; This is done by prayer, charity, or an act of Christian asceticism. The rite of the sacrament requires that &quot;the kind and extent of the satisfaction should be suited to the personal condition of each penitent so that each one may restore the order which he disturbed and through the corresponding remedy be cured of the sickness from which he suffered.&quot;

Penance may consist of prayer, works of mercy, service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, &quot;and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we all must bear. Such penances help configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins once for all.&quot;

=====Penitential acts=====
In the 1966 apostolic constitution Pope Paul VI said, &quot;Penance therefore—already in the Old Testament—is a religious, personal act which has as its aim love and surrender to God: fasting for the sake of God, not for one&#x27;s own self... [The Church] reaffirms the primacy of the religious and supernatural values of penitence (values extremely suitable for restoring to the world today a sense of the presence of God and of His sovereignty over man and a sense of Christ and His salvation).&quot; In it is affirmed that &quot;[b]y divine law all the faithful are required to do penance.&quot; &quot;As from the fact of sin we Christians can claim no exception, so from the obligation to penance we can seek no exemption.&quot; Chapter 8 of the Didache enjoined Christians to fast every Wednesday and Friday.

The conversion of heart can be expressed in many ways. &quot;Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three forms, &quot;fasting, prayer, and almsgiving&quot;, which express conversion in relation to oneself, to God, and to others.&quot; Also mentioned are efforts at reconciliation with one&#x27;s neighbor, and the practice of charity &quot;which covers a multitude of sins&quot; as in 1 Peter 4:8. &quot;Taking up one&#x27;s cross each day and following Jesus is the surest way of penance.&quot;

In the Liturgical year, the seasons of Advent and Lent are particularly appropriate for penitential exercises such as voluntary self-denial and fraternal sharing. Under canon 1250 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, &quot;The penitential days and times in the universal Church are every Friday of the whole year and the season of Lent.&quot; Canon 1253 states that &quot;The conference of bishops can determine more precisely the observance of fast and abstinence as well as substitute other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety, in whole or in part, for abstinence and fast.&quot;

In 2001 the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, in a document titled &quot;Penitential Practices for Today&#x27;s Catholics&quot;, reiterated their decision to allow U.S. Catholics to substitute another form of penance for abstinence from meat on the Fridays outside of Lent. While the document includes a list of suggested penitential practices, the selection of a Friday penance is left to the individual.

In 2011, Catholic bishops in England and Wales reversed their earlier decision to permit Catholics to practice a penance other than meat abstinence on Fridays. They said, in part: &quot;The bishops wish to re-establish the practice of Friday penance in the lives of the faithful as a clear and distinctive mark of their own Catholic identity.[...] It is important that all the faithful be united in a common celebration of Friday penance.&quot;

It is held that if fasting honestly causes one to be unable to fulfill their required tasks, it is uncharitable to fast, and the law of fasting would not apply.

Many acts of penance carry an indulgence, which may be applied in behalf of the souls departed. God alone knows what remains to be expiated. The Church, in granting an indulgence to the living, exercises its jurisdiction; over the dead it has no jurisdiction and therefore makes the indulgence available for them by way of suffrage (), i.e. it petitions God to accept these works of satisfaction and in consideration thereof to mitigate or shorten the sufferings of the souls in Purgatory.

====Eastern Orthodox Church====
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, penance is usually called Sacred Mystery of Confession. In Orthodoxy, the intention of the sacramental mystery of Holy Confession is to provide reconciliation with God through means of healing.

Similar to the Eastern Catholic Churches, in the Eastern Orthodox Church there are no confessionals. Traditionally the penitent stands or kneels before either the Icon of Christ the Teacher (to the viewers&#x27; right of the Royal Door) or in front of an Icon of Christ, &quot;Not Made by Hands&quot;. This is because in Orthodox sacramental theology, confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ; the priest being there as a witness, friend and advisor. On an analogion in front of the penitent has been placed a Gospel Book and a Crucifix. The penitent venerates the Gospel Book and the cross and kneels. This is to show humility before the whole church and before Christ. Once they are ready to start, the priest says, &quot;Blessed is our God, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages,&quot; reads the Trisagion Prayers and the Psalm 50 (in the Septuagint; in the KJV this is Psalm 51).

The priest then advises the penitent that Christ is invisibly present and that the penitent should not be embarrassed or be afraid, but should open up their heart and reveal their sins so that Christ may forgive them. The penitent then accuses themselves of sins. The priest quietly and patiently listens, gently asking questions to encourage the penitent not to withhold any sins out of fear or shame. After the confessant reveals all their sins, the priest offers advice and counsel. The priest may modify the prayer rule of the penitent, or even prescribe another rule, if needed to combat the sins the penitent struggles most with. Penances, known as &quot;epitemia&quot;, are given with a therapeutic intent, so they are opposite to the sin committed.

Epitemia are neither a punishment nor merely a pious action, but are specifically aimed at healing the spiritual ailment that has been confessed. For example, if the penitent broke the Eighth Commandment by stealing something, the priest could prescribe they return what they stole (if possible) and give alms to the poor on a more regular basis. Opposites are treated with opposites. If the penitent suffers from gluttony, the confessant&#x27;s fasting rule is reviewed and perhaps increased. The intention of Confession is never to punish, but to heal and purify. Confession is also seen as a &quot;second baptism&quot;, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;baptism of tears&quot;.

In Orthodoxy, Confession is seen as a means to procure better spiritual health and purity. Confession does not involve merely stating the sinful things the person does; the good things a person does or is considering doing are also discussed. The approach is holistic, examining the full life of the confessant. The good works do not earn salvation, but are part of a psychotherapeutic treatment to preserve salvation and purity. Sin is treated as a spiritual illness, or wound, only cured through Jesus Christ. The Orthodox belief is that in Confession, the sinful wounds of the soul are to be exposed and treated in the &quot;open air&quot; (in this case, the Spirit of God. Note the fact that the Greek word for Spirit (), can be translated as &quot;air in motion&quot; or wind).

Once the penitent has accepted the therapeutic advice and counsel freely given to them by the priest, then, placing his epitrachelion over the head of the confessant, the priest says the prayer of forgiveness over the penitent. In the prayer of forgiveness, the priests asks of God to forgive the sins committed. He then concludes by placing his hand on the head of the penitent and says, &quot;The Grace of the All-Holy Spirit, through my insignificance, has loosened and granted to you forgiveness.&quot;

In summary, the Priest reminds the penitent what they have received is a second baptism, through the Mystery of Confession, and that they should be careful not to defile this restored purity but to do good and to hear the voice of the psalmist: &quot;Turn from evil and do good&quot; (Psalm 34:14). Most importantly, the priest urges the penitent to guard themselves from sin and to commune as often as permitted. The priest dismisses the repentant one in peace.

====Anglicanism====

Private confession of sins to a priest, followed by absolution, has always been provided for in the Book of Common Prayer. There is no formal concept of penance.

==== Lutheranism ====

The Lutheran Church teaches two key parts in repentance (contrition and faith), and explicitly reject the need or practice of Catholic-style penance. Faith and trust in Jesus&#x27; complete active and passive satisfaction is what receives the forgiveness and salvation won by him and imparted to the penitent by the word of absolution.

====Reformed====
In the Reformed tradition (which includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist denominations), corporate confession is the normative way that confession and absolution is practiced, without penances. The Order of Worship in the Bible Presbyterian Church, for example, enjoins the following:
====Methodism====
John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, held &quot;the validity of Anglican practice in his day as reflected in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;&quot;, stating that &quot;We grant confession to men to be in many cases of use: public, in case of public scandal; private, to a spiritual guide for disburdening of the conscience, and as a help to repentance.&quot; Additionally, per the recommendation of John Wesley, Methodist class meetings traditionally meet weekly in order to confess sins to one another. No penances are involved.

== Penance in Indian beliefs ==

In Hinduism, acts of hardship committed on oneself (fasting, lying on rocks heated by the Sun, etc.), especially as part of an ascetic way of life (as monk or &#x27;wise man&#x27;) in order to attain a higher form of mental awareness (through detachment from the earthly, not punishing guilt) or favours from god(s) are considered penance. In Hinduism penance is widely discussed in Dharmasastra literature. In the Gita, there is a warning against excessive &quot;penance&quot; of a merely physical nature. There is the special term &quot;Tapas&quot;, for intense concentration that is like a powerful fire, and this used to be sometimes translated as &quot;penance&quot;, although the connotations are different.

The Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that &quot;When penance is carefully nourished and practiced, it inevitably results in the mental revocation of undesirable modes of thought and conduct, and makes one amenable to a life of purity and service.&quot;

<doc id="217481" wikidata="Q3290518" url="?curid=217481" title="History of Sweden (1523–1611)">
<text>The early Vasa era is a period in Swedish history that lasted between 1523–1611. It began with the reconquest of Stockholm by Gustav Vasa and his men from the Danes in 1523, which was triggered by the event known as the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520, and then was followed up by Sweden&#x27;s secession from the Kalmar Union, and continued with the reign of Gustav&#x27;s sons Eric XIV, John III, John&#x27;s son Sigismund, and finally Gustav&#x27;s youngest son Charles IX. The era was followed by a period commonly referred to as the Swedish Empire, or Stormaktstiden in Swedish, which means &quot;Era Of Great Power&quot;.

Gustav&#x27;s reign was marked by internal political and religious reforms, including the Protestant Reformation, where he converted to Protestantism and seized Catholic Church property and wealth, and unification of the provinces. At the death of Gustav in 1560, he was succeeded by his eldest son Eric. Eric was intelligent and skilled, but was in a constant strain with his brother and other noblemen. He engaged in warfare against both Denmark, Russia and Poland, but suffered periods of insanity in 1567. In 1568 he was dethroned and succeeded by his brother John.

John stabilized the international situation and made peace. He also wanted to partially restore Roman Catholicism but the idea did not come through in the end.

At the death of John in 1592, his son Sigismund succeeded him. Sigismund was already ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, through his mother, and he would rule Poland from 1587 to 1632. He set up a regency and continued to reside in Poland. On learning about the Uppsala Synod, that finally declared Sweden&#x27;s Lutheran doctrines, he returned home to protest. He found that the Riksdag of the Estates had already dethroned him and replaced him by Gustav Vasa&#x27;s youngest son, his uncle, Charles IX. A brief civil war ensued that Sigismund lost in 1598, where after he fled the country never to return.

==Establishment of the Vasa dynasty==

In 1520, Stockholm was taken by Christian II of Denmark and became the scene of the Stockholm Bloodbath. By 1521, Gustav Eriksson, a nobleman and relative of Sten Sture the Elder, managed to gather troops from Dalarna in north-west Sweden and help from Lübeck, with the purpose of defeating the Danes. In August 1521, his men elected him their monarch. The Swedish War of Liberation started, and would last until the capture of Stockholm, in June 1523. Gustav Vasa then consolidated his rule against claims from Denmark.

Tax reforms took place in 1538 and 1558, whereby multiple complex taxes on independent farmers were simplified and standardised throughout the district; tax assessments per farm were adjusted to reflect ability to pay. Crown tax revenues increased, but more importantly the new system was perceived as fairer and more acceptable. A war with Luebeck in 1535 resulted in the expulsion of the Hanseatic traders, who previously had had a monopoly of foreign trade. With its own businessmen in charge Sweden&#x27;s economic strength grew rapidly, and by 1544 Gustavus had support from 60% of the farmlands in all of Sweden. Sweden now built the first modern army in Europe, supported by a sophisticated tax system and government bureaucracy. Gustavus proclaimed the Swedish crown hereditary in his family, the house of Vasa. It ruled Sweden (1523–1654) and Poland (1587–1668).

After Gustav&#x27;s death, his oldest son Eric XIV ascended the throne. His regency was marked by Sweden&#x27;s entrance into the Livonian War and the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, and the mutual relation between his developing mental disorder and the opposition with the aristocracy, leading to the Sture Murders (1567) and the imprisonment of his brother John (III), who was married to Catherine Jagiellonica, the sister of Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. A magnates&#x27; uprising led by John led to Erik&#x27;s deposition and the kingship of John, followed by the regency of John&#x27;s son Sigismund. Sigismund however was not able to defend the throne against Gustav&#x27;s youngest son Charles (IX)

==Reformation==
Shortly after seizing power in 1523, Gustav Vasa addressed the Pope in Rome with a request for the confirmation of Johannes Magnus as new archbishop of Sweden, in the place of Gustav Trolle who had been formally deposed by the Riksdag of the Estates due to his involvement with the Danes. The pope initially refused, but gave his approval a year later. Magnus then was in a position between the reformation friendly king and the Catholic bishops. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Russia in 1526 while the king continued the reformation. Magnus travelled down to Rome and was consecrated in 1533, but never returned home.
Meanwhile, Gustav suppressed all Catholic printing-presses in 1526 and took two-thirds of the Church&#x27;s tithes for the payment of the national debt (owed to the German soldiers who helped him to the throne). In 1529, he summoned to a church meeting in Örebro. Without formally breaking with Rome, all Catholic rituals were declared as merely symbolic, although still retained. The Catholic support was still strong around the country, and Gustav preferred to move slow by first spreading education of the Reformation.

The final step was taken in 1531, when Gustav Vasa announced Laurentius Petri as the new archbishop of Uppsala and Sweden. Laurentius and his brother Olaus, and Mikael Agricola in Finland, wrote and printed Lutheran texts throughout the next decades. The opposition was still strong, and neither Gustav nor his successor Eric XIV dared making radical reforms. A complete Lutheran church ordinance was not presented until the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, defined in the Riksdag in 1591, with a statement of faith finalized by the Uppsala Synod in 1593.

=== Peasant risings ===
Gustav had to face half-dozen peasant risings between 1525 and 1543, ending when the Dacke War was crushed. In all these rebellions the religious issue figured largely, though the increasing fiscal burdens were undoubtedly grievous, and the peasants had their particular grievances besides. The wholesale seizure and degradation of Church property outraged them, and they formally protested against the introduction of &quot;Luthery.&quot; They insisted on the restoration of the ancient Catholic customs.

=== Attempts of Catholic reunification ===
Under Eric XIV the Reformation in Sweden proceeded on the same lines as during the reign of his father, retaining all the old Catholic customs not considered contrary to Scripture. After 1544, when the Council of Trent had formally declared the Bible and tradition to be equally authoritative sources of all Christian doctrine, the contrast between the old and the new teaching became more obvious; and in many countries a middle party arose which aimed at a compromise by going back to the Church of the Fathers. King John III of Sweden, the most learned of the Vasas, and somewhat of a theological expert, was largely influenced by these middle views. As soon as he had mounted the throne he took measures to bring the Church of Sweden back to &quot;the primitive Apostolic Church and the Swedish Catholic faith&quot;; and, in 1574, persuaded a synod, assembled at Stockholm, to adopt certain articles framed by himself. In February 1575 a new Church ordinance, approximating still more closely to the patristic Church, was presented to another synod and accepted, but very unwillingly. In 1576 a new liturgy was issued on the model of the Roman missal, but with considerable modifications.

Despite the opposition of Duke Charles and the ultra-Protestants, these measures were adopted by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1577. They greatly encouraged the Catholic party in Europe, and John III was ultimately persuaded to send an embassy to Rome to open negotiations for the reunion of the Swedish Church with the Holy See. But though the Jesuit Antonio Possevino was sent to Stockholm to complete John&#x27;s conversion, John would only consent to embrace Catholicism under certain conditions which were never fulfilled, and the only result of all these subterraneous negotiations was to incense the Protestants still more against the new liturgy, the use of which by every congregation in the realm without exception was, nevertheless, decreed by the Riksdag of 1582.

During this period Duke Charles and his Protestant friends were clearly outnumbered by the promoters of the middle way (). Nevertheless, immediately after King John&#x27;s death, the Uppsala Synod, summoned by Duke Charles, rejected the new liturgy and drew up an anti-Catholic confession of faith, March 5, 1593. Holy Scripture and the three primitive creeds were declared to be the true foundations of Christian faith, and the Augsburg confession was adopted.

=== Sigismund&#x27;s reaction ===
When Sigismund found out about the Uppsala Synod 1593, he considered it an infringement of his prerogative. On his arrival in Sweden he initially tried to gain time by confirming what had been done; but the aggressiveness of the Protestant faction and the persistence of Duke Charles made civil war inevitable. At the Battle of Stångebro on September 25, 1598, the struggle was decided in favour of Charles and Protestantism. Sigismund fled from Sweden, never to return, and on March 19, 1600, the Riksdag of Linköping proclaimed the duke king under the title of Charles IX of Sweden. Sigismund and his line of posterity were declared to have forfeited the Swedish crown, and was from then on to pass to the male heirs of Charles.

== Foreign affairs ==
Sweden had little independent foreign interaction while it was committed to the Kalmar Union, and Gustav’s earliest reign aimed at little more than self-preservation. As he was in debt to merchant of Lübeck, he used aid of Denmark to free himself from this deal by a truce of August 28, 1537. Thereby, Sweden for the first time in its history became the mistress of its own waters. But hegemony of Denmark was indisputable, and Gustav regarded them with suspicion. When Sweden broke away from the Kalmar Union, Denmark and Norway entered into their own union, (see Denmark–Norway), and the Danish king Christian III continued to carry the Swedish insignia of three crowns in his coat of arms, indicating a supposed claim of sovereignty.

Also offensive was the attitude of Sweden&#x27;s eastern neighbor Russia, with whom the Swedish king was nervously anxious to stand on good terms. Gustav attributed to Ivan IV of Russia, whose resources he unduly magnified, the design of establishing a universal monarchy round the Baltic Sea, and waged an inconclusive war against him in 1554–1557.

=== First involvements ===
Ultimately, Sweden departed from its neutrality and laid the foundations of its later overseas empire. In the last year of Gustav&#x27;s life, 1560, the ancient Livonian Order, had by the secularization of the latter order into the dukedom of Prussia, 1525, had become isolated between hostile Slavonians. The situation became critical in 1558–1560, when floods of Muscovites poured over the land, threatening the whole province with destruction.

In his despair, the last master of the order Gotthard von Kettler, appealed to his civilized neighbours to save him. Eric became ruler by October 1560, and already later that year he engaged Sweden in the Livonian War. By March 1561, the city council of Reval surrendered to Sweden, and became the outpost for further Swedish conquests in the area. From the moment, Sweden was forced to continue on a policy of combat and aggrandisement, because a retreat would have meant the ruin of its Baltic trade.

Erik XIV also obstructed Danish plans to conquer Estonia, and added the insignia of Norway and Denmark to his own coat of arms. Lübeck, upset over obstacles of trade that Erik had introduced to hinder the Russian trade and withdrawn trade privileges, joined Denmark in a war alliance. Poland soon joined, wanting control of the Baltic trade.

=== Deepening involvements ===
At Bornholm, on May 30, 1563, the Danish fleet fired on the Swedish navy. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On August 13, 1563, war was declared in Stockholm by emissaries from Denmark and Lübeck. The so-called Northern Seven Years&#x27; War commenced, with exhausting assault on land and water. Eric undaunted continued the war until his insanity in 1567 halted the Swedish warfare. He was dethroned in 1568 and replaced by John, who made peace attempts, which were eventually successful by the Treaty of Stettin in 1570.

John then entered an anti-Russian league with Stephen Báthory of Poland in 1578. The war between Russia and Sweden for the possession of Estonia and Livonia (1571–1577) had been uninterruptedly disastrous to Sweden, and, in the beginning of 1577, a countless Russian host sat down before Reval.

With the help of Bathory, however, the scales soon turned in the opposite direction. Six months after his humiliating peace with the Polish monarch, Ivan IV was glad to conclude a truce with Sweden also on a basis at Plussa, on August 5, 1582. The war was resumed by Russians as soon as the truce expired, leading to the Treaty of Tyavzino, far less advantageous for Sweden.

=== Sigismund and Polish relations ===
Duke Sigismund of Sweden, the son of John III, was brought up by his mother in the Catholic religion. On August 19, 1587, he was elected king of Poland. Sixteen days later the Articles of Kalmar, signed by John and Sigismund, regulated the future relations between the two countries when, in process of time, Sigismund should succeed his father as king of Sweden. The Articles of two kingdoms were to be in perpetual alliance, but each of them was to retain its own laws and customs. Sweden was also to enjoy its religion, subject to such changes as the Privy Council might make; but neither pope nor council was to claim or exercise the right of releasing Sigismund from his obligations to his Swedish subjects. During Sigismund&#x27;s absence from Sweden that realm was to be ruled by seven Swedes, six elected by the king and one by his uncle Duke Charles of Södermanland, the leader of the Swedish Protestants. No new tax was to be levied in Sweden during the king&#x27;s absence, but Sweden was never to be administered from Poland. Any necessary alterations in these articles were only to be made with the common consent of the king, Duke Charles, the Estates and the gentry of Sweden.

<text>Ross Robert Barnett (January 22, 1898November 6, 1987) was an American politician and segregationist who served as the 53rd governor of Mississippi from 1960 to 1964. He was a Southern Democrat who supported racial segregation.

== Early life ==

=== Background and learning ===
Born in Standing Pine in Leake County, Mississippi, Barnett was the youngest of ten children of John William Barnett, a Confederate veteran, and the former Virginia Ann Chadwick.

He served in the United States Army during World War I, then worked in jobs while earning an undergraduate degree from Mississippi College in Clinton in 1922. Four years later, he followed that with an LL.B. from the University of Mississippi (commonly known as &quot;Ole Miss&quot;) at Oxford, where he gave courses to freshmen.

In order to save money, he worked as schoolhouse janitor, barber, brass band organizer, and door-to-door salesman for WearEver aluminum products.

=== Legal career ===
His first legal case was, while he was still at Ole Miss, over a replevin case about a cow, which he won and for which he received a $2.50 fee; his first real case as a lawyer was about representing a black woman suing her ex-husband over the value of a sidesaddle, losing this case in the justice court but winning it in the county court, earning himself $7.50.

After trying and failing to join an existing law firm, he rented space near Charles Crisler&#x27;s office, and soon founded his own law firm; over the next quarter century, Barnett became one of the state&#x27;s most successful trial lawyers, earning more than $100,000 a year with specialty in damage suits against corporations. Most of his clients were poor whites and blacks, and tales were told about an elderly black man being injured in a traffic accident and asking for &quot;Doctor Ross Barnett&quot; when asked which doctor to call.

Ole Miss Law School Dean Robert Farley described him as such: &quot;He was not a brilliant lawyer, he was a brilliant jury manipulator, but I don&#x27;t think anybody ever accused Ross of knowing much law&quot;.

He often donated his skills to causes and served as president of the Mississippi Bar Association for two years beginning in 1943.

=== Personal life ===
In 1929, he married Mary Pearl Crawford, a school teacher; the couple had two daughters and a son.

== Political life ==

=== First steps ===
Using the income derived from his legal fees, Barnett sought to enter politics, unsuccessfully running twice in the Democratic primary for Governor of Mississippi, in 1951 and 1955. At the time, Mississippi was a one-party state dominated by the Democrats, and the Democratic primary was the only meaningful contest.

On his third try in 1959, he won the nomination, in a campaign which mostly ran on segregation, publishing the brochure &quot;Dynamic Leadership – To Keep Segregation and Improve Our Standard of Living&quot; and making statements such as &quot;The Negro is different because God made him different to punish him. His forehead slants back. His nose is different. His lips are different, and his color is sure different.&quot; His song &quot;Roll with Ross&quot;, whose tune was later used for the state anthem &quot;Go, Mississippi&quot;, contained the following:
Roll with Ross, roll with Ross, he&#x27;s his own bossFor segregation, one hundred percentHe&#x27;s not a moderate like some of the gentsHe&#x27;ll fight integration with forceful intent.

No Republican even filed, and Barnett was unopposed in the November general election. His inauguration was on January 19, 1960. During his term in office, he celebrated the centennial of the American Civil War. Barnett traveled to Civil War sites to pay homage to fallen &quot;sons of Mississippi&quot;.

In 1960, Barnett ran in the Democratic Party presidential primaries as a favorite son candidate. He ran to protest leading candidate John Kennedy&#x27;s support of the civil rights movement, but lost. Following this, Barnett attempted to establish a third-party movement akin to the Dixiecrat movement of 1948. He aimed to counter the civil rights plank adopted by the Democratic National Convention in 1960, which he found repulsive. However, his efforts to garner support from fellow southern governors failed. Consequently, Barnett proposed a group of uncommitted Democratic electors, who triumphed over the Mississippi slate committed to endorsing Kennedy in the November elections. Ultimately, these electors allocated the state&#x27;s eight electoral votes to Senator Harry F. Byrd.

=== Governorship ===
During his first months as governor, the state legislature saw the introduction of 24 new bills advocating segregation, and directives were issued to circuit clerks, instructing them to withhold voter registration data from the Justice Department. In his capacity as the chairman of the State Sovereignty Commission, Barnett financially supported the Mississippi Association of Citizens Councils, granting them more than $100,000 in state grants 1962. Barnett, a staunch segregationist, became known for his tumultuous clashes with the civil rights movement which dominated his term.

Barnett arranged for the arrest of Freedom Riders in 1961 and then imprisoned them at Parchman Farm. While their offenses were minor, the Freedom Riders were strip-searched, had beds taken away, and were humiliated and brutalized in the prison. Barnett reportedly told the guards to &quot;break their spirits, not their bones&quot;.

While this approach gained approval in the state, it was done in part to blunt the criticism that he was receiving for multiple reasons: failing to follow through with promises of jobs for office-seekers; filling those jobs with acquaintances, and attempting to wrest control of state agencies from the legislature. Barnett was a member of the white supremacist Citizens&#x27; Councils movement.

In 1962, the state agency in charge of universities and colleges, the Institutions of Higher Learning, appointed Barnett the registrar in order to oppose James Meredith&#x27;s efforts to desegregate Barnett&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Mississippi. With the accreditation of the state&#x27;s medical school and other universities in jeopardy due to the political interventions, the IHL board reversed their action after the riots on the campus. Barnett was fined $10,000 and sentenced to jail for contempt but never paid the fine or served a day in jail. This was because the charges were terminated (civil) and dismissed (criminal) by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals because of &quot;substantial compliance with orders of the court,&quot; and &quot;in view of changed circumstances and conditions.&quot; Only two Mississippi legislators opposed Barnett&#x27;s efforts to defy the federal authorities, Joe Wroten and Karl Wiesenburg. On September 13, he said that &quot;There is no case in history where the Caucasian race has survived social integration. We will not drink from the cup of genocide.&quot;

On the night before the Ole Miss riot of 1962 protesting Meredith&#x27;s entry to the university, Barnett gave his sixteen-word &quot;I Love Mississippi&quot; speech at the University of Mississippi football game in Jackson. The Ole Miss Rebels were playing the Kentucky Wildcats. 41,000 fans cheered at the stadium waving thousands of Confederate flags. At halftime, a gigantic Confederate flag was unveiled on the field. The crowd shouted &quot;We want Ross!&quot;. Barnett went to the field, grabbed the microphone at the 50-yard line and said to an enthusiastic crowd:

I love Mississippi! I love her people! Our customs. I love and I respect our heritage.

Many Mississippians linked segregation to the Bible. Barnett, a Baptist Sunday school teacher, declared &quot;The Good Lord was the original segregationist. He put the black man in Africa. ... He made us white because he wanted us white, and he intended that we should stay that way.&quot; Barnett said that Mississippi had the largest percent of black Americans because &quot;they love our way of life here, and that way is segregation.&quot;

In 1963, Barnett tried to prevent the men&#x27;s basketball team of Mississippi State University from playing an NCAA Tournament game against the racially integrated team from Loyola of Chicago. The team defied Barnett by sneaking out of the state and playing the game, which they lost to the eventual national champions.

=== After his term ===

==== Challenge from Republicans ====

Barnett&#x27;s term as governor officially expired on January 21, 1964, with the swearing-in of his successor, the outgoing lieutenant governor, Paul B. Johnson. Barnett was known for his strong opposition to the development of the two-party system in the former Democratic stronghold of Mississippi. Along with state Democratic chairman Bidwell Adam, Barnett campaigned strongly for his state Democratic ticket, including Paul Johnson for governor to succeed Barnett and Carroll Gartin for lieutenant governor, the man that Barnett had defeated for governor four years earlier.

Johnson and Gartin faced the challenge of the Republicans Rubel Phillips and Stanford Morse, the first Republican ticket for governor and lieutenant governor to run in Mississippi in decades. Barnett urged his state&#x27;s Democratic voters to &quot;push out this Republican threat&quot; and added that he was &quot;fed up with these fence-riding, pussy-footing, snow-digging Yankee Republicans&quot;, a reference to northern transplants coming into Mississippi.

Barnett was expected by some to run in the 1964 Democratic presidential primaries as a segregationist candidate against incumbent U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, but he did not. Governor George C. Wallace of Alabama subsequently assumed this role in part, not running openly against Johnson but rather testing his popularity in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Maryland. Barnett opposed Johnson, whom he called a &quot;counterfeit confederate...who [might] someday resign from the white race&quot; during a &quot;Patriot&#x27;s Rally Against Tyranny&quot; on , and supported Barry Goldwater due to his vote against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Shortly after he left office, Barnett&#x27;s looming presence was evident at the first jury trial of white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith in February 1964. De La Beckwith was on trial for the murder of African American civil rights activist Medgar Evers, but an all-white jury was unable to agree on a verdict in both this and a subsequent re-trial. In the second subsequent re-trial, former Governor Ross Barnett interrupted the proceedings, while Myrlie Evers was testifying, to shake hands with Beckwith. De La Beckwith was eventually convicted at a subsequent trial three decades later, a case chronicled in the movie &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot;.

==== &quot;Ole Miss&quot; controversy with Robert F. Kennedy ====
On March 18, 1966, former United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who frequently conversed by telephone with Barnett during the Meredith crisis in attempts to peacefully secure Meredith&#x27;s enrollment at Ole Miss, visited the campus. In a speech before more than 6,000 students and faculty, Kennedy discussed racial reconciliation and answered questions, including those about his role in Meredith&#x27;s enrollment. To much laughter from the audience members, he told of a plan in which Barnett had asked that US marshals point their guns at him while Meredith attempted to enroll so that &quot;a picture could be taken of the event.&quot;

He also drew laughter by recounting another plan where Meredith would go to Jackson to enroll while Barnett remained in Oxford &quot;and when Meredith was registered, he (Barnett) would feign surprise.&quot; Both plans were approved by Kennedy and failed only because of the development of events. When Kennedy finished his speech and question-and-answer session, he was greeted by a standing ovation.

The next day Barnett bitterly attacked Kennedy&#x27;s version of events:
It ill becomes a man who never tried a lawsuit in his life, but who occupied the high position of United States attorney general and who was responsible for using 30,000 troops and spent approximately six million dollars to put one unqualified student in Ole Miss to return to the scene of this crime and discuss any phase of this infamous affair. ... I say to you that Bobby Kennedy is a very sick and dangerous American. We have lots of sick Americans in this country but most of them have a long beard. Bobby Kennedy is a hypocritical, left-wing beatnik without a beard who carelessly and recklessly distorts the facts.

== Later life ==
Barnett attempted a political comeback by running for governor again in 1967 but lost, finishing a distant fourth in the state primary. He then returned to the practice of law, but remained unrepentant about his past, saying, &quot;Generally speaking, I&#x27;d do the same things again.&quot; He also farmed and spoke before various groups, such as the American Legion.

Barnett expressed no remorse for his role in segregation. When he was asked in 1982 about the Ole Miss riot, Barnett said, &quot;&#x27;I have no regrets, no apologies to make.&quot;

Ross Barnett Reservoir, located northeast of Jackson, is named in his honor. In May 2022, a petition began to be circulated to rename the reservoir after outdoors writer R. H. Cleveland. In Smith County, a lake was named after him before it was renamed Lake Prentiss Walker.

<text>Richard Philip Lewis (June 29, 1947 – February 27, 2024) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. Lewis came to prominence in the 1980s and became known for his dark, neurotic, and self-deprecating humor. As an actor, he was known for starring in the ABC sitcom &quot;Anything but Love&quot; from 1989 to 1992, and for playing the role of Prince John in the 1993 film &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;. Lewis also had a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself in the HBO comedy series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; from 2000 to 2024.

==Early life and education ==
Lewis was born on June 29, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York City. He was raised in Englewood, New Jersey. He was born into a Jewish family, but was not especially religious. His father, Bill (d. 1971), was co-owner of Ambassador Caterers in nearby Teaneck, New Jersey, and his mother, Blanche, was an actress in community theatre. Lewis was the youngest of three siblings. His sister was older by 9 years, and his brother by 6. His father&#x27;s catering business kept him very busy, and his siblings had both left home by the 1960s, leaving Lewis at home alone with his mother, with whom there was friction. Lewis told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2014 that he suspected that his birth had been a mistake.

Lewis was known for being the class clown and causing trouble in school. He graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in 1965 and attended Ohio State University where he attained a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in Marketing four years later in 1969. He was the recipient of the Fisher College of Business Alumni Achievement Award in November 2023.

==Career==
Lewis first tried stand-up at an open mic in Greenwich Village in 1971. He began writing and regularly performing stand-up comedy in 1972, while working as a copywriter for an advertising agency by day. He was discovered by comedian David Brenner while performing in Greenwich Village. Brenner helped Lewis&#x27;s career by introducing him to the comedy clubs in Los Angeles and getting Lewis his first appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. By the mid-1970s, Lewis had appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and publications, such as the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; magazine, were naming him one of the &quot;new breed&quot; or &quot;class&quot; of comedians; this list containing names such as Robert Klein, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Andy Kaufman, Richard Belzer, and Elayne Boosler. His influences were Richard Pryor, Buster Keaton, Woody Allen, and Lenny Bruce.

Lewis was known for dark comedy, self-deprecation, and for frank discussions regarding his many neuroses, as well as his struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction. He was noted for wearing all-black attire and for pacing and gesticulating wildly during his stand-up act. In his early days, he was also known for bringing taped-together sheets from a legal pad to his performances; he would lay them across the floor in front of him to remind him of joke premises and topics he wished to cover during his performance.

Lewis made his screen acting debut in &quot;Diary of a Young Comic&quot;, a 90-minute film that aired on NBC in 1979 in the timeslot normally reserved for episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. A satirical look at the Hollywood scene, Lewis stars in the film as Billy Gondola (born Gondolstein), a young Jewish comedian who leaves New York City to find fame in Los Angeles. The film&#x27;s script was co-written by Lewis and Bennett Tramer, and was adapted from a story written by Gary Weis, who also served as the film&#x27;s director. The film features Bill Macy as Billy&#x27;s father, Michael Lerner as his agent, and Stacy Keach as a landlord. Performers George Jessel, Dom DeLuise, Nina van Pallandt, and Gary Mule Deer make appearances in the film as themselves.

Lewis gained much wider exposure in the 1980s and 1990s with numerous appearances on talk shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, both &quot;Late Night&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;The Howard Stern Show.&quot; He also produced the comedy special &quot;I&#x27;m in Pain&quot;, which aired on Showtime in 1985, followed by the specials &quot;I&#x27;m Exhausted&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Doomed&quot;, and &quot;Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour&quot;, all of which aired on HBO in 1988, 1990, and 1997 respectively. From 1989 to 1992, he co-starred with Jamie Lee Curtis on the sitcom &quot;Anything but Love&quot;. He also starred on the short-lived sitcoms &quot;Daddy Dearest&quot; with Don Rickles in 1993, and &quot;Hiller and Diller&quot; with Kevin Nealon in 1998. He played Prince John in the 1993 film &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;, and starred as a struggling alcoholic and drug addict in the 1995 drama film &quot;Drunks.&quot; The latter film featured performances from Faye Dunaway, George Martin, Parker Posey, Howard Rollins, Spalding Gray, and Dianne Wiest, and was based on Gary Lennon&#x27;s play &quot;Blackout&quot;. Lewis also appeared in the 1995 drama film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas, a&quot;nd the 1997 romantic comedy &quot;Hugo Pool&quot;.

Into the 2000s, Lewis had recurring roles as a B movie producer on the sitcom &quot;Rude Awakening,&quot; and as Rabbi Richard Glass on the family drama series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. He also had a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as a semi-autobiographical version of himself. Lewis first met the show&#x27;s star and creator, Larry David, at summer camp in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, when they were 12 years old; Lewis claimed that, at the time, they hated each other. The pair met again over a decade later while performing stand-up in New York and became friends.

==Recognition==
&quot;GQ&quot; magazine included Lewis on their list of &quot;The 20th Century&#x27;s Most Influential Humorists&quot;, and Lewis was ranked  45 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Standups of All Time&quot; released in 2004.

In 2006, &quot;The Yale Book of Quotations&quot; included an entry for the expression &quot;the ______ from hell&quot; (as in &quot;the night from hell&quot;, &quot;the date from hell&quot;. etc.,) that was attributed to Lewis. Lewis also petitioned the editors of &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot; to include the idiom, which was also worked into the plot of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; during the episode &quot;The Nanny from Hell&quot;. His lawyer sent some video tapes to &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s&quot; general editor Justin Kaplan showing Lewis using the phrase. &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s&quot; declined, stating that the expression had predated Lewis&#x27;s first taped broadcast. In response, Lewis told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that he traces popular usage of the line back to his early days on David Letterman&#x27;s show.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage ===
Lewis met Joyce Lapinsky in 1998 at a Ringo Starr album release party, while Lapinsky was working in music publishing. The pair became engaged in 2004 and married the following year.

=== Substance abuse issues ===
Lewis was open about his recovery from alcohol and drug abuse, having been a user of both cocaine and crystal meth. His addictions worsened into the 1990s, prompting Lewis to stop performing stand-up from 1991 to 1994. In a 1995 interview with the &quot;Santa Maria Times&quot;, Lewis discussed how John Candy&#x27;s death the year prior had caused him to reflect upon his own life and career. The two starred together in Candy&#x27;s last film, the Western-themed comedy film &quot;Wagons East&quot;. In later interviews, Lewis stated that he got sober in 1994 after winding up in a hospital emergency room due to a cocaine overdose.

Lewis published his memoir in 2000, titled &quot;The Other Great Depression&quot;. The book was reissued in 2008 with an added afterword where Lewis reflected further on his continued struggles with addiction. In 2015, he released the book &quot;Reflections from Hell: Richard Lewis&#x27; Guide on How Not to Live&quot;; it contains his commentary and observations in the form of one-liners and other comedic premises, interspersed with images created by artist Carl Nicholas Titolo.

===Health problems and death===
Discussions of Lewis&#x27;s battles with anxiety and depression, and his multiple therapy sessions, were a fixture of his comedy. He also stated in interviews that he suffered from an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia. Lewis struggled with health problems resulting in multiple surgeries. In 2016, he shattered his right hand after falling from his roof; in 2019, he had back surgery related to acute back pain; and in early 2020, he shattered his shoulder, resulting in another surgery. In the latter year, it was revealed that Lewis had battled multiple health problems and was in great pain during the shooting of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. He announced that he would be appearing in only one episode of Season 11. Lewis returned in Season 12, the series&#x27; final season, most episodes of which premiered after his death. 

In April 2023, Lewis announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease two years earlier. He said he would no longer perform stand-up comedy and was instead &quot;focused on writing and acting&quot;.

Lewis died of a heart attack at his home in Los Angeles on February 27, 2024, at the age of 76. Friends and colleagues, including &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; co-star Cheryl Hines and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; creator Larry David, made statements regarding Lewis&#x27; death and paid homage to Lewis. He is buried at the Temple of Aaron Cemetery in Roseville, Minnesota.

<doc id="217486" wikidata="Q17079845" url="?curid=217486" title="History of Sweden (1611–1648)">
<text>During the 17th century, despite having scarcely more than 1 million inhabitants, Sweden emerged to have greater foreign influence, after winning wars against Denmark–Norway, the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Its contributions during the Thirty Years&#x27; War under Gustavus Adolphus helped determine the political, as well as the religious, balance of power in Europe.

== Charles IX ==

On March 6, 1604, when Duke John, son of John III of Sweden and brother of Sigismund III Vasa, formally renounced his hereditary right to the throne, Charles IX of Sweden styled himself king. At the Riksdag of the same year, the estates committed themselves irrevocably to Protestantism by excluding Catholics from the succession to the throne, and prohibiting them from holding any office or dignity in Sweden. Henceforth, every Roman Catholic recusant was to be deprived of his estates and banished from the realm. It was in the reign of Charles IX that Sweden became not only a predominantly Protestant, but also a predominantly military monarchy. This change, which was to give a martial colouring to the whole policy of Sweden for the next hundred and twenty years, dates from a decree of the Riksdag of Linköping establishing, at the urgent suggestion of Charles, a regular army; each Province in the country being henceforth liable to provide and maintain a fixed number of infantry and cavalry for the service of the state. Their immediate enemy was Poland, now dynastically as well as territorially linked to Sweden.

The struggle took the shape of a contest for the possession of the northern Baltic provinces. Estonia was recovered by the Swedes in 1600, but their determined efforts of 1601–1609 to gain a foothold in Livonia were frustrated by the military ability of the Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz. In 1608 hostilities were transferred to Russian territory. At the beginning of that year Charles had concluded an alliance with Tsar Vasili IV of Russia against their common foe, the Polish king; but when, in 1610, Vasili was deposed by his own subjects and the whole tsardom seemed to be on the verge of dissolution, Sweden&#x27;s policy towards Russia changed its character.

Hitherto Charles had aimed at supporting the weaker Slavonic power against the stronger; but now that Russia seemed about to disappear from among the nations of Europe, Swedish statesmen naturally sought some compensation for the expenses of the war before Poland had had time to absorb everything. A beginning was made by the siege and capture of County of Kexholm in Russian Finland March 2, 1611; and on July 16, Great Novgorod was occupied and a convention concluded with the magistrates of that wealthy city whereby Charles IX&#x27;s second son Philip was to be recognized as tsar, unless in the meantime, relief came to Great Novgorod from Moscow. But now, when everything depended on a concentration of forces, Charles&#x27;s imprudent assumption of the title of &quot;King of the Lapps of Nordland&quot; which people properly belonged to the Danish Crown, involved him in another war with Denmark, a war known in Scandinavian history as the Kalmar War because the Swedish fortress of Kalmar was the chief theatre of hostilities. Thus the Swedish forces were diverted from their real objective and transferred to another field where even victory would have been comparatively unprofitable. But it was disaster, not victory, which Charles IX of Sweden reaped from this foolhardy enterprise.

Still worse, the Kalmar War, prudently concluded by Charles&#x27; son, Gustavus Adolphus, in the second year of his reign, by the Treaty of Knäred, January 20, 1613 imposed such onerous pecuniary obligations and such intense suffering upon Sweden as to enkindle into a fire of hatred, which was to burn fiercely for the next two centuries, the long smouldering antagonism between the two sister nations of Scandinavia which dated back to the bloody days of Christian Tyrant.

== Ingrian War ==
The Russian difficulty was more easily and more honourably adjusted. When Novgorod submitted provisionally to the suzerainty of Sweden, Swedish statesmen had believed, for a moment, in the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda. The rallying of the Russian nation round the throne of the new tsar, Michael Romanov, dissipated, once and for all, this ambitious dream. By the beginning of 1616, Gustavus had become convinced of the impossibility of partitioning reunited Russia, while Russia recognized the necessity of buying off the invincible Swedes by some cession of territory. By the Treaty of Stolbovo on February 27, 1617 the tsar surrendered to the Swedish king the provinces of County of Kexholm and Ingria, including the fortress of Nöteborg (later Schlusselburg), the key to Finland. Russia, furthermore, renounced all claims upon Estonia and Livonia and paid a war indemnity of 20,000 roubles. In return for these concessions, Gustavus restored Novgorod and acknowledged Michael Romanov as tsar of Russia.

The same period which saw the extension of the Swedish Empire abroad, saw also the peaceful development of the Swedish Rule of constitution at home. In this, as in every other 
Gustavus matter, Gustavus Adolphus himself took the initiative. Nominally the Riksråd still remained the dominant power in the state; but gradually all real authority had been transferred to the crown. The Privy Council speedily lost its ancient character of a grand council representing the semi feudal landed aristocracy, and became a bureaucracy holding the chief offices of state at the pleasure of the king. The Riksdag also changed its character at the same time. Whilst in every other European country except the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and England the ancient popular representation by estates was about to disappear altogether, in Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus it grew into an integral portion of the Constitution of Sweden. The Riksdag Ordinance of 1617 first converted a turbulent and haphazard mob of &quot;riksdagsmen&quot; huddling together like a flock of sheep or drunken boors, into a dignified national assembly, meeting and deliberating according to rule and order. One of the nobility (first called the Landmarskalk, or Marshal of the Diet, in the Riksdag ordinance of 1526) was now regularly appointed by the king as the spokesman of the House of Nobles, or &quot;Riddarhus&quot;, while the primate generally acted as the talman or president of the three lower estates, the clergy, burgesses and peasants. Eventually, each of the three lower estates elected its own talman, or &quot;speaker&quot;. At the opening of every session, the king submitted to the estates &quot;royal propositions&quot;, or bills, upon which each estate proceeded to deliberate in its own separate chamber. The replies of the estates were delivered to the king at a subsequent session in congress. Whenever the estates differed amongst themselves, the king chose whatever opinion seemed best to him. The rights of the Riksdag were secured by the Konungaförsäkran, or assurance given by every Swedish king on his accession, guaranteeing the collaboration of the estates in the work of legislation, and they were also to be consulted on all questions of foreign policy. The king possessed the initiative; but the estates had the right of objecting to the measures of the government at the close of each session. It is in Gustavus&#x27; reign, too that we first hear of &quot;Hemliga Utskottet&quot;, or &quot;Secret Committee&quot; for the transaction of extraordinary affairs, which was elected by the estates themselves. The eleven Riksdags held by Gustavus Adolphus were almost exclusively occupied in finding ways and means for supporting the ever-increasing burdens of the Polish and German wars. Gustavus owed much of his success as an empire-builder to the religious and patriotic zeal of the Swedes, and their willingness to sacrifice.

== The Polish War and the Battle of Stralsund ==
The wars with Denmark and Russia had been almost exclusively Scandinavian wars, but the Polish war was of worldwide significance. It was, in the first place, a struggle for the Baltic littoral, and the struggle was intensified by the knowledge that the Polish Vasas denied the right of Gustavus to the Swedish throne. In the eyes of the Swedish king, moreover, the Polish War was a war of religion. Gustavus regarded the Scandinavian kingdoms as the two chief pillars on which the Evangelical religion reposed. Their disunion, he argued, would open a door in the north to the Catholic league and so bring about the destruction of Denmark and Sweden alike. Hence his alliance with Denmark to defend Stralsund in 1628. There was much unconscious exaggeration in all this. As a matter of fact the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was no danger whatsoever to Protestantism. Sigismund&#x27;s obstinate insistence upon his right to the Swedish crown was the one impediment to the conclusion of a war which the Polish Diet heartily detested and very successfully impeded. Apart from the semi-impotent Polish court, no responsible Pole dreamed of aggrandisement in Sweden. In fact, during the subsequent reign of Ladislaus IV of Poland (1632–1648), the Poles prevented that martial monarch from interfering in the Thirty Years&#x27; War on the Catholic side. Gustavus, whose lively imagination was easily excited by religious ardour, enormously magnified clerical influence in Poland and frequently scented dangers where only difficulties existed.

For eight years, (1621–1629), the exhausting and expensive Polish War dragged on. Swedish Livonia was conquered by the beginning of 1626, and the theatre of hostilities was transferred to the Prussian provinces of Poland. The fertile and easily defensible delta of the Vistula was now occupied and Gustavus treated it as a permanent conquest, making his great Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna its first Governor-General. But this was the limit of the Swedish advance. All Gustavus&#x27;s further efforts were frustrated by the superior strategy of the Polish hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, and in June 1629, the king gladly accepted the lucrative Treaty of Altmark. By this truce Sweden was, for six years, to retain possession of its Livonian conquests, besides holding Elbing, the Vistula delta, and Braunsberg in West Prussia, and Pillau and Memel in East Prussia, with the right to levy tolls at Pillau, Memel, Danzig, Libau and Windau. From these tolls Gustavus derived, in 1629 alone, 500,000 Riksdalers, a sum equivalent to the whole of the extraordinary subsidies granted to him by the Riksdag.

It was for this war that the Swedish warship Vasa, which sank just outside Stockholm, was built. The ship was poorly designed: top-heavy with insufficient ballast, she capsized as soon as she encountered a wind stronger than a breeze. Due to the low salinity of the Baltic Sea, the wreck suffered little damage from shipworms and was salvaged, in surprisingly good condition, in 1961.

==The Thirty Years&#x27; War==

Thus Sweden held, for a time, the control of the principal trade routes of the Baltic up to the very confines of the empire; and the increment of revenue resulting from this commanding position was of material assistance during the earlier stages of the war in Germany, whither Gustavus transferred his forces in June 1630. Gustavus, later to be called &quot;the Lion of the North&quot; due to his skills as a commander, intervened on the Protestant side in the German civil war. Using new military techniques such as lighter and more mobile artillery and cavalry shocks, he won an astounding victory at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. In the Battle of Lützen on November 6, 1632, he was killed, though, and Sweden lost their warrior-king. The battle itself was a draw, but two years later the tide turned at Nördlingen, where Imperial troops won a convincing victory over the Protestant Army. In order to prevent the Habsburgs from winning the war, France, who had already given subsidies to Sweden following the Treaty of Bärwalde (1631), intervened on the Protestant side. The war dragged on for many years until a peace agreement was at last reached in 1648.

<doc id="217487" wikidata="Q1072770" url="?curid=217487" title="Human rights in China">
<text>Human rights in the People&#x27;s Republic of China are poor, as per reviews by international bodies, such as human rights treaty bodies and the United Nations Human Rights Council&#x27;s Universal Periodic Review. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), their supporters, and other proponents claim that existing policies and enforcement measures are sufficient to guard against human rights abuses. However, other countries (such as the United States and Canada), international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including Human Rights in China and Amnesty International, and citizens, lawyers, and dissidents inside the country, state that the authorities in mainland China regularly sanction or organize such abuses.

Independent NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as foreign governmental institutions such as the U.S. State Department, regularly present evidence of the PRC violating the freedoms of speech, movement, and religion of its citizens and of others within its jurisdiction. Authorities in the PRC claim improvement in human rights, as they define them differently, so as to be dependent on &quot;national culture&quot; and the level of development of the country. However, governments have a duty to promote and protect all human rights universally, regardless of their national circumstances. PRC politicians have repeatedly maintained that, according to the PRC Constitution, the &quot;Four Cardinal Principles&quot; supersede citizenship rights. PRC officials interpret the primacy of the Four Cardinal Principles as a legal basis for the arrest of people who the government says seek to overthrow the principles. Chinese nationals whom authorities perceive to be in compliance with these principles, on the other hand, are permitted by the PRC authorities to enjoy and exercise all the rights that come with citizenship of the PRC, provided they do not violate PRC laws in any other manner.

Numerous human rights groups have publicized human rights issues in mainland China that they consider the government to be mishandling, including: the death penalty (capital punishment), the one-child policy (in which China had made exceptions for ethnic minorities prior to abolishing it in 2015), the political and legal status of Tibet, and neglect of freedom of the press in mainland China. Other areas of concern include the lack of legal recognition of human rights and the lack of an independent judiciary, rule of law, and due process. Further issues raised in regard to human rights include the severe lack of workers&#x27; rights (in particular the &quot;hukou&quot; system which restricts migrant labourers&#x27; freedom of movement), the absence of labour unions independent of the CCP, the implementation of Social Credit System and its blacklist, which serve to restrict a person and their family members&#x27; rights, and allegations of discrimination against rural workers and ethnic minorities, as well as the lack of religious freedom rights groups have highlighted repression of the Christian, Tibetan Buddhist, Uyghur Muslim, and Falun Gong religious groups. Some Chinese activist groups are trying to expand these freedoms, including Human Rights in China, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group. Chinese human rights attorneys who take on cases related to these issues, however, often face harassment, disbarment, and arrest.

According to the Amnesty International report from 2016/2017 the government continued to draft and enact a series of new national security laws that presented serious threats to the protection of human rights. The nationwide crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists continued throughout the year. Activists and human rights defenders continued to be systematically subjected to monitoring, harassment, intimidation, arrest, and detention. The report continues that police detained increasing numbers of human rights defenders outside of formal detention facilities, sometimes without access to a lawyer for long periods, exposing the detainees to the risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Booksellers, publishers, activists, and a journalist who went missing in neighboring countries in 2015 and 2016 turned up at detention in China, causing concerns about China&#x27;s law enforcement agencies acting outside their jurisdiction.

In a human rights report that assesses social, economic, and political freedoms, China has received the lowest ranking globally for safety from state actions and the right to assemble.

==History==
==Legal system==
Since the legal reforms of the late 1970s and 1980s, the CCP has officially moved attempted to embrace the language of the rule of law and it has also attempted to establish a modern court system. During this process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and it has begun to train more legal professionals. The concept of &#x27;rule of law&#x27; has been emphasized in the constitution, and the ruling party has embarked on campaigns to promote the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the constitution itself, in which the Communist Party insists that its authority supersedes that of the law. Thus, the constitution enshrines the rule of law, yet simultaneously stresses the principle that the &quot;leadership of the Communist Party&quot; holds primacy over the law and the legal system.

The judiciary is not independent of the CCP, and judges face political pressure; in many instances, private party committees dictate the outcome of cases. In 2007, law and the judiciary were further subordinated to the interests of the CCP under the doctrine of the Three Supremes. This has produced a system often described as &quot;rule &quot;by&quot; law&quot; (alluding to the CCP&#x27;s power), rather than rule &quot;of&quot; law. Moreover, the legal system lacks protections for civil rights, and often fails to uphold due process. This is opposed to a system of checks and balances or separation of powers.

Foreign experts estimate that in 2000, there were between 1.5 million and 4 million people in prison in mainland China. The PRC does not allow outsiders to inspect its penal system.

==Civil liberties==

===Freedom of speech===
Although the 1982 constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the Chinese government often uses the &quot;subversion of state power&quot; and &quot;protection of state secrets&quot; clauses in their law system to imprison those who criticize the government. Another crime used to jail critics such as Sun Dawu is &quot;picking quarrels and provoking trouble&quot;.

During the 2008 Summer Olympics, the government promised to issue permits authorizing people to protest in specifically designated &quot;protest parks&quot; in Beijing. However, a majority of the applications were withdrawn, suspended, or vetoed, and the police detained some of the people who applied.

References to certain controversial events and political movements, as well as access to web pages considered by the PRC authorities to be &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;threatening to state security&quot;, are blocked on the internet in the PRC; and content disputed by or critical of PRC authorities is absent from many publications, and subject to the control of the CCP within mainland China. Laws in the People&#x27;s Republic of China forbid the advocacy of separation of any part of its claimed territory from mainland China, or public challenge to the CCP&#x27;s domination of the government of China. An unsanctioned protest during the Olympics by seven foreign activists at the China Nationalities Museum, protesting for a free Tibet and blocking the entrance, was cleared and the protesters deported.

Foreign Internet search engines including Microsoft Bing, Yahoo!, and Google China have come under criticism for aiding these practices. Yahoo!, in particular, stated that it will not protect the privacy and confidentiality of its Chinese customers from the authorities.

In 2005, after Yahoo! China provided its personal emails and IP addresses to the Chinese government, reporter Shi Tao was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years for releasing an internal Communist Party document to an overseas Chinese democracy site. Skype president Josh Silverman said it was &quot;common knowledge&quot; that TOM Online had &quot;established procedures to...block instant messages containing certain words deemed offensive by the Chinese authorities&quot;.

In June 2020, Cai Xia, a retired professor of CCP&#x27;s Central Party School, criticized Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the CCP, called him a &quot;mafia boss&quot; and the ruling Communist Party a &quot;political zombie&quot;. In a 20-minute audio on social networking sites, she said that everyone is Xi&#x27;s slave, and there is no human rights and rule of law, She suggested that Xi should retire. On 17 August 2020, Cai Xia was expelled from the CCP&#x27;s Central Party School and her retirement pensions were cancelled.

====Freedom of speech during the Coronavirus crisis of 2020====
During the Coronavirus crisis of 2020, the PRC is reported to have suppressed the news of the virus and also attempted to downplay and under report deaths. There are reports of detentions, assaults, torture, and disappearances of whistleblowers including activists, doctors, lawyers, students, and businessmen who created and uploaded videos of overburdened hospitals and high numbers of deaths.
Some of these whistleblowers were:
* Li Wenliang, a Chinese medical doctor who worked at Wuhan Central Hospital and issued emergency warnings to other hospitals and doctors about the new disease. He was arrested and accused of &quot;making false comments&quot; that had &quot;severely disturbed the social order&quot;.
* Fang Bin, a Chinese businessman, citizen journalist and whistleblower who broadcast images of Wuhan during the Coronavirus crisis. He has been missing since 9 February 2020.
* Chen Qiushi, a Chinese lawyer, activist, and citizen journalist who covered the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and the COVID-19 pandemic and was missing since 6 February 2020 until September 2020 when he was found but &quot;not free.&quot; After 600 days, he re-appeared in a letter at his Twitter account. &quot;Over the past year and eight months, I have experienced a lot of things. Some of it can be talked about, some of it can&#x27;t,&quot; Chen&#x27;s letter read. &quot;I believe you understand.&quot;
* Li Zehua, a Chinese citizen journalist, rapper, and YouTuber who was trying to trace missing lawyer and citizen journalist Chen Qiushi. He was missing since 26 February 2020 until late April 2020 when he posted a YouTube video that he had been forcibly quarantined for almost two months.
* Chen Mei and El amogid Wei, activists who were sharing censored articles about the coronavirus outbreak on an online archive, have been noncontactable since 19 April 2020
* Li-Meng Yan, a Hong Kong virologist and whistleblower had to escape to the US, after she found large scale cover ups of the pandemic by Chinese authorities. She said that if she told her story of the coverup in China, she &quot;will be disappeared and killed.&quot;
* Independent journalist Zhang Zhan was served a four-year prison sentence for &quot;picking quarrels and provoking troubles&quot;, a charge she received after she flew to Wuhan following the COVID-19 outbreak. At the time, she knew she was risking her own safety and arrest, but she wanted to learn more about the COVID-19 situation and share her findings with others.

===Freedom of the press===

Critics argue that the CCP has failed to live up to its promises about the freedom of the mainland Chinese media. The US-based NGO Freedom House consistently ranks China as &quot;Not Free&quot; in its annual press freedom survey, including the 2014 report. PRC journalist He Qinglian says that the PRC&#x27;s media are controlled by directives from the Communist Party&#x27;s propaganda department, and are subjected to intense monitoring which threatens punishment for violators, rather than to pre-publication censorship. In 2008, ITV News reporter John Ray was arrested while covering a &quot;Free Tibet&quot; protest. International media coverage of Tibetan protests only a few months before the Beijing Olympics in 2008 triggered a strong reaction inside China. Chinese media practitioners took the opportunity to argue with propaganda authorities for more media freedom: one journalist asked, &#x27;If not even Chinese journalists are allowed to report about the problems in Tibet, how can foreign journalists know about the Chinese perspective about the events?&#x27; Foreign journalists also reported that their access to certain websites, including those of human rights organizations, was restricted. International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge stated at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games that &#x27;The regulations [governing foreign media freedom during the Olympics] might not be perfect but they are a sea-change compared to the situation before. We hope that they will continue.&#x27; The Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) issued a statement during the Olympics that &quot;despite welcome progress in terms of accessibility and the number of press conferences within the Olympic facilities, the FCCC has been alarmed at the use of violence, intimidation, and harassment outside. The club has confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference since the formal opening of the Olympic media center on 25 July, and is checking at least 20 other reported incidents.&quot;

Since the Chinese state continues to exert a considerable amount of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has come as a surprise to many observers. Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CCP, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China&#x27;s changing media environment has affected the government&#x27;s ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realizing that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.

In 2012 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Chinese government to lift restrictions on media access to the region and allow independent, impartial monitors to visit and assess conditions in Tibet. The Chinese government did not change its position.

In March 2020, China expelled employees of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in response to the U.S. declaring that five state-owned Chinese media outlets were operating as foreign missions of the government with their staff being re-designated employees of the Chinese government, requiring approval similar to diplomatic employees.

China has periodically deported foreign journalists. Ursula Gauthier, a journalist from France working for the media organization &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot;, was sent back to France after she commented on China&#x27;s response to the Paris attacks that happened in November 2015. She noted that China&#x27;s sympathetic stance wasn&#x27;t &quot;without ulterior motives.&quot;

Gauthier had previously reported on China&#x27;s persecution of the Uyghur ethnic group, many of whom believe in Islam. China often accuses Uyghur people of terrorism and has set up a system of camps, which they claim are &quot;vocational training centers.&quot; However, those who have lived through the camps allege that the authorities torture, rape, and sexually abuse the prisoners as well as force them into unpaid labor and sterilize the women. Moreover, many experts and foreign policymakers consider the detentions arbitrary rather than linked to provable terrorist charges. As such, journalists such as Gauthier have been critical of China&#x27;s actions.

At the time of Gauthier&#x27;s expulsion, she was the first journalist to be deported since China expelled Melissa Chan from Al Jazeera in 2015. Chan had reported on China&#x27;s &quot;black jails&quot; and government land confiscation. Of her deportation, China Global Television Network&#x27;s Yang Rui wrote, &quot;We should shut up those who demonize China and send them packing&quot;, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

====Information hyper-control====
The 2020 World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), shows that mainland China is the world&#x27;s biggest jailer of journalists. According to the report, China is trying to establish a &quot;new world media order&quot; and maintain a system of information hyper-control, the negative effects of which the entire world experienced during the coronavirus public health crisis. It states that the PRC never stops enhancing its system of information hyper-control and persecution of dissident journalists and bloggers, and that further evidence of this came in February 2020, when two citizens were arrested for their coverage of the coronavirus crisis. China currently detains around 100 journalists, of whom the vast majority are Uyghurs.

On 29 May 2022, the U.S. expressed concern over China&#x27;s &quot;efforts to restrict and manipulate&quot; the UN human rights chief&#x27;s visit to the Xinjiang region. The conditions imposed by the Beijing authorities on Michelle Bachelet&#x27;s visit, did not enable a complete and independent assessment of the human rights environment in China.

====Freedom of the Internet====
More than sixty Internet regulations exist in mainland China and serve to monitor and control internet publication. These policies are implemented by provincial branches of state-owned Internet service providers, companies, and organizations. The apparatus of the PRC&#x27;s and/or CCP&#x27;s Internet control is considered more extensive and more advanced than in any other country in the world. The Golden Shield includes the ability to monitor online chatting services and mail, identifying IPs and all of the person&#x27;s previous communication, and then being able to lock in on the person&#x27;s location—because a person will usually use the computer at home or at work – which enables the arrest to be carried out. Amnesty International notes that China &quot;has the largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world&quot; and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders stated in 2010 and 2012 that &quot;China is the world&#x27;s biggest prison for netizens.&quot;

As an example of the censorship, in 2013, 24 years after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, online searches for the term &#x27;Tiananmen Square&#x27; were still censored by Chinese authorities. According to the Amnesty International report the controls on the Internet, mass media, and academia were significantly strengthened. For instance, Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Wikipedia are banned in mainland China. Repression of religious activities outside of direct state control increased.

===Hukou system===
The CCP came to power in the late 1940s and instituted a command economy. In 1958, Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, adopted a residency permit system defining where people could work, and classified workers as rural or urban. In this system, a worker who was seeking to move from the country to an urban area in order to take up non-agricultural work would have to apply for permission to do so through the relevant bureaucratic institutions. There is uncertainty, however, as to how strictly the system has been enforced. People who worked outside the region in which they were registered would not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, or health care. There were controls over education, employment, marriage, and other areas of life. One reason which was cited for the instituting of this system was the desire to prevent the possible chaos which would be caused by predictable large-scale urbanization. As a part of the one country, two systems policy which was proposed by Deng Xiaoping and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies with the rest of the PRC. Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before they were allowed to travel to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover. Since then, restrictions which have been imposed by the SAR governments have been the main factors which limit travel.

In 2000, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that although migrant labourers play a major role in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated &quot;like second-class citizens by a system which is so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid.&quot; Anita Chan also posits that the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation which is analogous to the passbook system that was implemented in South Africa in order to control the supply and actions of cheap labourers from underprivileged ethnic groups, as well as to control the quality and quantity of such labourers. In 2000, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy alleged that people of Han descent in Tibet have a far easier time acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do.

Abolition of this policy has been proposed in 11 provinces, mainly along the developed eastern coast. After a widely publicized incident in 2003, when a university-educated migrant died in Guangdong province, the law was changed in order to eliminate the possibility of summary arrest for migrant labourers. The Beijing law lecturer who exposed the incident said it spelt the end of the &quot;hukou&quot; system: he believed that in most smaller cities, the system had been abandoned, and it had &#x27;almost lost its function&#x27; in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.

====Treatment of rural workers====
In November 2005, Jiang Wenran, acting director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, said that the &quot;hukou&quot; system was one of the most strictly enforced apartheid structures in modern world history. He stated, &quot;Urban dwellers enjoy a range of social, economic, and cultural benefits while peasants, the majority of the Chinese population, are treated like second-class citizens.&quot;

The discrimination which was enforced by the &quot;hukou&quot; system became particularly onerous in the 1980s after hundreds of millions of migrant workers were forced out of state corporations, co-operatives, and other institutions. Attempts to move to urban centers by workers who were classified as rural workers were tightly controlled by the Chinese bureaucracy, which enforced its control by denying them access to essential goods and services such as grain rations, housing, and health care, and regularly closing down migrant workers&#x27; private schools. The &quot;hukou&quot; system also enforced pass laws which have been compared to those which existed in apartheid South Africa. Rural workers who wanted to work in provinces other than their own were required to possess six passes, and the police periodically conducted raids in which they rounded up those workers who were without permits, placed them in detention centers for a short period of time, and then deported them. It is also found that rural workers have been paid under minimum wage to nothing at all. A group of coal miners in Shuangyashan were being paid little to nothing. With the families and people whom they had to care for, each and every one of the workers protested for the money that they deserved. As in South Africa, the restrictions placed on the mobility of migrant workers were pervasive, and transient workers were forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or shanty towns, suffering abusive consequences. Anita Chan comments further that China&#x27;s household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in apartheid South Africa, which were designed to regulate the supply of cheap labor.

The Chinese Ministry of Public Security has justified these practices on the grounds that they have assisted the police in tracking down criminals and maintaining public order, and they have also provided demographic data for government planning and programs.

===Freedom of association===

The People&#x27;s Republic of China does not allow freedom of association in general; in particular, it does not allow a free choice of membership with trade unions and political parties. Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), articles 20 and 23, every worker has the right to join an association of their choosing, to have their interests represented against their employer, and to take collective action including the right to strike. In China, on a model similar to the Deutsche Arbeitsfront from 1934 to 1945 in Germany, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has a monopoly on union activity: it is effectively a nationalized organization. This dynamic violates International Labour Organization Conventions Number 87 and 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The leadership of the ACFTU is not freely elected by its members, and it is not independent from the state or employers.

The CCP effectively monopolizes organized political activity in China. There is, therefore, no possibility of genuine electoral competition at any level of government, nor within the Party itself. This violates the UDHR article 21(1), which states, &#x27;Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.&#x27;

===Religious freedom===
During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), particularly during the Destruction of the Four Olds campaign, religious affairs of all types were persecuted, renounced, and strongly discouraged by Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s government and its ideological allies. Many religious buildings were looted or destroyed. Since then, there have been efforts to repair, reconstruct and protect historical and cultural religious sites. In its International Religious Freedom Report for 2013, the US Department of State criticized the PRC as follows:

The 1982 Constitution provides its citizens the right to believe in any religion, as well as the right to refrain from doing so:

Members of the Communist Party are officially required to be atheists, but this rule is not regularly enforced and many party members privately engage in religious activities. Global studies from Pew Research Center in 2014 and 2017 ranked the Chinese government&#x27;s restrictions on religion as among the highest in the world, despite low to moderate rankings for religious-related social hostilities in the country.

====Christianity====

The Chinese government tries to maintain tight control over all organized religions, including Christianity. The only legal Christian groups are the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, the latter of which has been condemned by the Pope. Both of these groups are under the control of the CCP. The members of the illegal, underground Catholic church and members of Protestant house churches face prosecution from PRC authorities.
In 2007, the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association elected a Catholic bishop of Beijing to replace the deceased Fu Tieshan. The standard Catholic practice is for a bishop to be appointed by the Pope; the Catholic Church does not recognize the legitimacy of bishops elected by the Association, but not appointed by the Pope. According to Pope Benedict XVI, the Catholic Church in particular is viewed in China as a foreign power. Its situation is somewhat analogous to that of the Catholic Church in Post-Reformation England, in which the official church was also controlled by the state.

In early January 2018, Chinese authorities in Shanxi province demolished a church, which created a wave of fear among the Christians. In reports of countries with the strongest anti-Christian persecution, China was ranked by the Open Doors organization in 2019 as the 27th most severe country and in 2020 as 23rd most severe.
====Tibetan Buddhism====
The Dalai Lama is a highly influential figure in Tibetan Buddhism, who has traditionally lived in Tibet. Because of Chinese governmental control over the Tibetan area, the current Dalai Lama resides in Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, in the Republic of India. In a regulation promulgated 3 August 2007, the Chinese government declared that after 1 September 2007, &quot;[no] living Buddha [may be reincarnated] without government approval, since the Qing dynasty, when the live Buddha system was established.&quot; The PRC Government-appointed Panchen Lama is labelled a fake by those who regard the PRC&#x27;s effort to control organized religion as contradictory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other ethical principles.

Examples of the political controls exercised over religion in 1998 include:
* quotas on the number of monks to reduce the spiritual population;
* forced denunciation of the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader;
* the expulsion of unapproved monks from monasteries;
* forced recitation of patriotic scripts supporting China;
* restriction of religious study before age 18.

Monks celebrating the reception of the US Congressional Gold Medal by the Dalai Lama have been detained by the PRC. In November 2012 the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner urged the PRC to address the allegations of rights violations in Tibet; the violations had led to an alarming escalation of &#x27;desperate&#x27; forms of protest in the region, including self-immolations. Amnesty International report reports that Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and in Tibetan-populated areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHINA 2016/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetans who opposed the diversion of irrigation water by Chinese authorities to the China Gold International Resources mining operations were detained, tortured, and murdered. Allegations of what the PRC officially labelled &#x27;judicial mutilation&#x27; against Tibetans by the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government, and the serfdom controversy, have been cited by the PRC as reasons to interfere for what they claim was the welfare of Tibetans, although their claims of &#x27;judicial mutilation&#x27; are controversial and subject to scepticism and dispute by foreign countries and international organizations. Conflicting reports about Tibetan human rights have been produced since then. The PRC claims that Tibet has been enjoying a cultural revival since the 1950s, whereas the Dalai Lama says &#x27;whether intentionally or unintentionally, somewhere cultural genocide is taking place&#x27;.

Following the Chinese economic reform, businesspeople from other parts of China have made many business trips to Tibet, although most do not stay in the region. The &quot;New York Times&quot; has cited this ethnic diversity in Tibet as a cause of &quot;ethnic tensions&quot;. It has also disagreed significantly with the promotion by PRC authorities of home ownership in nomadic Tibetan societies. Western politicians often level the charge that the Tibetan languages are at risk of extinction in Tibet. Others, however, both inside and outside China and Tibet, claim that for a vast majority of Tibetans, who live in rural areas, the Chinese language is merely introduced as a second language in secondary school.

====Uyghurs====
Article 36 of the PRC Constitution provides constitutional protection for citizens&#x27; freedom of religion and the country&#x27;s official ethnic policies also reiterate protection of the freedom of religion of ethnic minorities, but in practice the Uyghur population, predominantly living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, are subject to strict controls on the practice of Islam.

Examples of these restrictions now include:
*Official religious practices must be held in government-approved mosques;
*Uyghurs under 18 years old are not allowed to enter mosques or pray in school;
*The study of religious texts is only permitted in designated state schools;
*Government informers regularly attend religious gatherings in mosques;
*Women are not allowed to wear headscarves and veils and men are not allowed to have beards;
*The use of traditionally Islamic names (e.g., Abdul), is banned.

Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chinese counter-terror legislation has made explicit links between religion and extremism, and has led to regulations that explicitly ban religious expression among Uyghurs in particular.

Since 2017, reports have surfaced that around a million Muslims (Uyghur Chinese citizens and some Central Asian nationals) were detained in internment camps throughout Xinjiang without trial or access to a lawyer. In these camps they were allegedly &#x27;re-educated&#x27; to disavow their Islamic beliefs and habitats while praising the Communist Party. The camps have expanded rapidly, with almost no judicial process or legal paperwork. Chinese officials are quoted in state media as saying that these measures are to fight separatism and Islamic extremism. Critics of the policy have described it as the sinicization of Xinjiang and called it an ethnocide or cultural genocide, with many activists, NGOs, human rights experts, government officials, and the U.S. government calling it a genocide.

New bans and regulations were implemented on 1 April 2017. Abnormally long beards and wearing veils in public were both banned. Not watching state-run television or listening to radio broadcasts, refusing to abide by family planning policies, or refusing to allow one&#x27;s children to attend state-run schools were all prohibited. Giving a child a name that would &quot;exaggerate religious fervor&quot;, such as Muhammad, was made illegal. Along with this, many mosques were demolished or destroyed.

According to Radio Free Asia, the Chinese government jailed Uyghur Imam Abduheber Ahmet after he took his son to a religious school not sanctioned by the Chinese state. Ahmet had previously been lauded by China as a &quot;five-star&quot; imam but was sentenced in 2018 to over five years in prison for his action.

Also in 2018, over one million Chinese government workers began forcibly living in the homes of Uyghur families to monitor and assess resistance to assimilation, and to watch for frowned-upon religious or cultural practices. These government workers were trained to call themselves &quot;relatives&quot; and have been described in Chinese state media as being a key part of enhancing &quot;ethnic unity&quot;.

In addition, records of the government indicate that thousands of Uyghur children have been separated from their parents. New evidence shows that over 9,500 children in Yarkand county had at least one parent detained, most of them are Uyghur children. According to the researcher Adrian Zenz, in 2019, the number of children living in boarding facilities increased by 76%, reaching a total of 880,500 children.

In March 2020, the Chinese government was found to be using the Uyghur minority for forced labor, inside sweat shops. According to a report published then by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), no fewer than around 80,000 Uyghurs were forcibly removed from the region of Xinjiang and used for forced labor in at least twenty-seven corporate factories. According to the Business and Human Rights resource center, corporations such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Adidas, Amazon, Apple, BMW, Fila, Gap, H&amp;M, Inditex, Marks &amp; Spencer, Nike, North Face, Puma, PVH, Samsung, and UNIQLO have sourced from these factories prior to the publication of the ASPI report.

On 10 October 2020, the UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy urged Britain to block China&#x27;s seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council over the country&#x27;s treatment of Uyghur Muslims.

On 19 January 2021, outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally declared that China is committing a genocide against the Uyghurs and crimes against humanity. In a written letter, Pompeo wrote, &quot;I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state.&quot; Pompeo called for &quot;all appropriate multilateral and relevant juridical bodies, to join the United States in our effort to promote accountability for those responsible for these atrocities.&quot; China strongly denies that human rights abuses are going on in Xinjiang. Pompeo has previously stated that China is trying to &quot;erase its own citizens.&quot;

In 2021, independent sources reported that Uyghur women in China&#x27;s internment camps have been systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured. Victims said there is a system of organized rape. The Chinese police also electrocute and torture them. There is planned dehumanization, sterilization, and torture. China has undertaken a deliberate campaign to weaken and eradicate any vestiges of Uyghur culture, employing measures such as curtailing religious liberties and enforcing assimilation. Detainees have recounted experiences of being coerced to abandon their beliefs and swear allegiance to the CCP using methods reminiscent of psychological manipulation.

On 16 August 2021, a young Chinese woman, named Wu Huan, told the &quot;Associated Press&quot; in her testimony that she was allegedly held for eight days at a Chinese-run secret detention facility in the United Arab Emirates, along with two other Uyghurs. Wu Huan said she was abducted from a hotel in Dubai and detained by Chinese officials at a villa converted into a jail. It was the first evidence that China was operating a &quot;black site&quot; beyond its borders.

On 31 August 2022, the UN Human Rights Office issued an assessment of human rights concerns in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The report published in the wake of the visit by UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, stated that &quot;allegations of patterns of torture, or ill-treatment, including forced medical treatment and adverse conditions of detention, are credible, as are allegations of individual incidents of sexual and gender-based violence.&quot;

A leaked document known as &quot;The China Cables&quot; details the conditions in the aforementioned internment camps. These documents describe guidelines on a variety of things: preventing escapes, monitoring the Uyghurs, disciplining the Uyghurs, and much more. They are taught Mandarin and about Chinese culture. However, some claim this is renouncing their culture to conform to the communist party. Many Chinese officials have already dismissed the claims of breaching human rights and the contents of these documents. They refer to these camps as voluntary education centers where the Uyghurs are reeducated. The goal of these camps, according to former Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming, is to prevent terrorism. A United Nations assessment of human rights regarding the Xinjiang Uyghurs stated it is &quot;reasonable to conclude that a pattern of large-scale arbitrary detention occurred in [vocational education and training centre] facilities, at least during 2017 to 2019&quot;, negating previous Chinese government claims that the facilities were schools or training centres where participants were free to join and leave.

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) gave statement on China&#x27;s human rights violations in Xinjiang, following a visit to the region by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. An FCDO spokesperson said, &quot;It is clear that the Chinese authorities did not provide the full, unfettered access to Xinjiang for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that we and our international partners have long called for. China&#x27;s failure to grant such access only serves to highlight their determination to hide the truth.&quot;

====Falun Gong====
Following a period of meteoric growth of Falun Gong in the 1990s, the Communist Party, which was then led by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, banned Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. An extra-constitutional body called the 6-10 Office was created to lead the suppression of Falun Gong. The authorities mobilized the state media apparatus, judiciary, police, army, the education system, families, and workplaces against the group. The campaign is driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio, and internet. There are reports of systematic torture, illegal imprisonment, forced labour, organ harvesting, and abusive psychiatric measures, with the apparent aim of forcing practitioners to recant their belief in Falun Gong.

Foreign observers estimate that hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in &quot;re-education through labor&quot; camps, prisons, and other detention facilities for refusing to renounce the spiritual practice. Former prisoners have reported that Falun Gong practitioners consistently received &quot;the longest sentences and worst treatment&quot; in labour camps, and in some facilities Falun Gong practitioners formed the substantial majority of detainees. As of 2009 at least 2,000 Falun Gong adherents had been tortured to death in the persecution campaign, with some observers putting the number much higher.

Some international observers and judicial authorities have described the campaign against Falun Gong as a genocide. In 2009, courts in Spain and Argentina indicted senior Chinese officials for genocide and crimes against humanity for their role in orchestrating the suppression of Falun Gong.

=====Organ harvesting=====

According to allegations which were made in 2006, the vital organs of non-consenting Falun Gong practitioners had been used to supply China&#x27;s organ tourism industry. In 2008, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for &quot;the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners and the source of organs for the sudden increase in organ transplants that has been going on in China since the year 2000&quot;.

Matas, Kilgour, and Gutmann have published three books in which they have alleged that organ harvesting is occurring in China. The Kilgour-Matas report stated, &quot;the source of 41,500 transplants for the six-year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained&quot; and &quot;we believe that there has been and continues today to be large-scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners&quot;. Ethan Gutmann, who interviewed over 100 individuals as witnesses, estimated that 65,000 Falun Gong prisoners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008.

===Political freedom===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has not ratified it. Legally, all citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China who have reached the age of 18 have the right to vote and stand for election, regardless of ethnicity, race, sex, occupation, family background, religious belief, education, property status, or length of residence, except for persons deprived of political rights according to laws imposed by the .

In Mao&#x27;s China, the CCP openly repressed all opposing political groups. This behaviour is now reflected in the judicial system, and has evolved into the selective repression of small groups of people who overtly challenge the CCP&#x27;s power or its people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship. The most recent major movement advocating for political freedom was obliterated through the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, the estimated death toll of which ranges from about 200 to 10,000 depending on sources. In November 1992, 192 Chinese political activists and democracy advocates submitted a petition to the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party to introduce political reforms. One of the six demands was the ratification of the Covenant. As a reaction to the petition, the Chinese authorities arrested Zhao Changqing, proponent of the petition, and are still holding a number of activists for attempted subversion.

One of the most famous dissidents is Zhang Zhixin, who is known for standing up against the ultra-left.

In October 2008, the government denounced the European Parliament&#x27;s decision to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to political prisoner Hu Jia, maintaining that it was &quot;gross interference in China&#x27;s domestic affairs&#x27; to give such an award to a &quot;jailed criminal... in disregard of [the Chinese government&#x27;s] repeated representations.&quot;

Although the Chinese government does not violate its people&#x27;s privacy as much or as overtly as it used to, it still deems it necessary to keep track of what people say in public. Internet forums are strictly monitored, as are international postal mail (which sometimes is inexplicably delayed, or simply disappears) and e-mail.

Local officials are chosen by election, and even though non-Communist Party candidates are allowed to stand, those with dissident views can face arbitrary exclusion from the ballot, interference with campaigning, and even detention.

Freedom House rates China as a 6 (the second lowest possible rank) in political freedoms. In 2011, the organization said of the Chinese political leadership:

Jiang Tianyong is the latest lawyer known for defending jailed critics of the government. In the 709 crackdown which began in 2015, more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants, and activists, including Jiang, were arrested &quot;and/or&quot; detained.

====Independence movements====

The independence movements in China are mainly contained within the Inner Mongolian Regions, the Tibetan region, and the Xinjiang region. These regions contain people from ethnic and religious minority groups such as the Mongols, the Tibetans, and the Uyghurs.

The Chinese government has had strained relations with these regions since the early 1910s, when the first president of the Chinese Republic, Sun Yat-sen, suggested a plan to move a large number of Han people from Southeast China to Northwest China in an effort to assimilate the ethnic minorities that lived in the area. While Sun Yat-sen lost political power before he could enforce this plan, his sinocentric, assimilationist attitude was adopted by future leader Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek enacted educational policy that encouraged cultural assimilation and discouraged self-determinism until 1945, when Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist party became more lenient toward the various ethnic minorities. From this time until the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China under Mao Zedong, ethnic minorities experienced great independence from the Chinese government, with Mongolia becoming an independent state in 1921 and Xinjiang being named an autonomous region in 1955.

Tibetan, Mongolian, and Xinjiang independence was severely restricted by the Communist Party in the 1950s under Mao Zedong, with the forced annexation of Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang back into mainland China, leading to many protests and riots from the ethnic and religious minorities in the autonomous regions. From this point onward, there has been a sustained outpouring of secessionist and independence movements from China&#x27;s autonomous regions.

Currently, the largest independence struggle is being waged by the Muslim-Turkic population of Xinjiang, which shares minimal cultural, lingual, and historical similarities with the Han population in China. While the Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping promised to grant some advantages to the population of Xinjiang such as practising affirmative action in universities, greater liberties with regard to China&#x27;s one-child policy, and increased government subsidies in the region, the government also discourages and restricts the Muslim-Turkic ethnic population from freely practising its religion, expressing its faith by wearing head scarves, fasting, growing facial hair, and building mosques freely. Furthermore, because of the advantages which the Chinese government grants to the people of Xinjiang, many Han Chinese are prejudiced against them, and their prejudice against the Uyghurs is bolstered by the widespread belief that the government unfairly grants preferential treatment to ethnic minorities in general.

One noteworthy event is the Feb 1997 riots in Yining, a county which is located between Kazakhstan and Xinjiang, during which 12 independence movement leaders were executed and 27 others were arrested and incarcerated. Moreover, almost 200 Uyghurs were killed and over 2,000 more Uyghurs were arrested. In 2008 riots broke out within Tibetan regions such as Lhasa, and anti-Han &quot;pogroms&quot; were committed in Ürümqi, Xinjiang in July 2009. In response to these riots, the Chinese government has increased its police presence in these regions and it has also sought to control offshore reporting and intimidate foreign-based reporters by detaining their family members.

====Political abuse of psychiatry====
Political abuse of psychiatry began to be practised in mainland China during the 1950s, shortly after Mao Zedong established the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and continues to be practised in different forms up to present day. Initially, under Mao Zedong, the practice of psychiatry in China saw legitimate improvements in the breadth and quality of treatments. However, as time passed under the direction of Mao Zedong and the campaign of ideological reform was implemented, psychiatric diagnoses became used as a way to control and incarcerate Chinese citizens who didn&#x27;t subscribe to Maoist ideologies such as Marxism–Leninism. The main demographic of Chinese citizens being targeted and placed in mental asylums were academics, intellectuals, students, and religious groups for their capitalist tendencies and bourgeois worldview. The justification for placing those who didn&#x27;t comply with Maoist principles in mental institutions was the belief that non-Maoist political ideologies such as capitalism caused extreme individualism and selfishness, which contributed to mental disabilities such as schizophrenia and paranoid psychosis.  Maoists justified their claim that anti-Communist beliefs caused mental imbalances by making a positive correlation between the wealth and class of a particular group of people and the number of &quot;mentally ill&quot; people within that group. 

Political abuse of psychiatry in mainland China peaked from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. During this time, Chinese counterrevolutionists and political dissidents were placed into mental asylums, where they were treated with psychotherapy (xinli zhiliao) resembling political indoctrination sessions. During this time, statistics indicate that there were more political activists being held in mental institutions than the number of rapists, murderers, arsonists, and other violent mentally ill people combined. The human rights activist Wei Jingsheng was among the first to speak out about the misappropriation of psychiatry for political purposes in the winter of 1978; however, in response to his advocacy, he was imprisoned and subjected to involuntary drugging and beating by the Chinese government. 

After the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes continually diminished until the 1990s, when there was a resurgence in politically motivated psychiatric diagnoses toward political dissidents and minority religious groups. During this more recent wave of Chinese forensic psychiatry, political dissidents and practicers of non-mainstream religions were sent to Ankang (meaning peace and health) hospitals. These hospitals, built to hold the criminally insane, are managed by Bureau No. 13 of China&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security. Ankang hospitals have been the target of much scrutiny by human rights activists and organizations both inside and outside of China, and reports indicate inhumane treatment of patients inside these hospitals. Patients in these hospitals are forced to work at least 7 hours a day and are subjected to torture including acupuncture with electric currents, forced injection of drugs that are known to damage the central nervous system, and physical abuse with ropes and electric batons. Furthermore, reports by Chinese surgeons at these hospitals report on the use of psychosurgery on patients who were involuntarily placed in these hospitals to reduce &quot;violent and impulsive behaviors&quot;. One of the most targeted groups of Chinese citizens to be placed in Ankang hospitals are the practicers of Falun Gong, who have what is termed &quot;evil cult-induced mental disorder&quot; or &quot;xiejiao suo zhi jingshen zheng&#x27;ai&quot; by Chinese psychiatry. Over 1000 practitioners have been incarcerated in mental asylums across 23 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.

One of the most famous cases of politically motivated psychiatric diagnoses took place in 1992, when Wang Wanxing was arrested for displaying a pro-democracy banner in Tiananmen Square. After Wang&#x27;s arrest, his wife signed a statement confirming his mental instability, because police told her that doing so would ensure Wang&#x27;s immediate release. However, Wang was instead placed in the Beijing Ankang hospital. He was exiled to Germany in 2005.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China is the only country which currently abuses psychiatry for political purposes in a systematic way, and despite international criticism, this abuse seems to be continuing as of 2010. Political abuse of psychiatry in the People&#x27;s Republic of China is high on the agenda in the international psychiatric community, and has produced recurring disputes. The abuses there appear to be even more widespread than in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s and involve the incarceration of petitioners, human rights workers, trade union activists, followers of the Falun Gong movement, and people complaining against injustices by local authorities.

In August 2002, the General Assembly of the WPA was held during the WPA World Congress in Yokohama. The issue of Chinese political abuse of psychiatry was placed on the agenda of the General Assembly, and a decision was made to send an investigative mission to China. The visit was projected for the spring of 2003, in order to assure that a representative of the WPA could present a report during the Annual Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in May 2003, as well as at the annual meeting of the British Royal College of Psychiatrists in June and July of that year. The 2003 investigative mission never took place, and when the WPA did organize a visit to China, it was more a scientific exchange. In the meantime, the political abuse of psychiatry persists unabated.

====Political prisoners====

The Chinese government has a history of imprisoning citizens for political reasons. Article 73 of China&#x27;s Criminal Procedure Law was adopted in 2012 and allow the authorities to detain people for reasons of &quot;state security&quot; or &quot;terrorism&quot;. In this regard, detainees can be held for as long as six months in &quot;designated locations&quot; such as secret prisons.

The number of political prisoners peaked during the Mao era and it has been decreasing ever since. From 1953 to 1975, around 26 to 39 per cent of prisoners were incarcerated for political reasons. By 1980, the percentage of prisoners incarcerated for political reasons was only 13 per cent, and this figure decreased to 0.5 per cent in 1989 and 0.46 per cent in 1997. 1997 is also the year that the Chinese Criminal Law was amended to replace counterrevolutionary crime with crimes endangering national security.

During the Mao era, one notorious labour camp called Xingkaihu which was located in the northeastern Heilongjiang Province was operated from 1955 to 1969. During this time, over 20,000 inmates were forced to work on irrigation, infrastructure construction, and agricultural projects for the government while being subjected to ideological reform; a significant percentage of these inmates were incarcerated for being counterrevolutionaries and political dissidents. The conditions in Xingkaihu were so poor that many inmates eventually died due to malnutrition and disease.

More recently, since the spring of 2008, the Chinese government has detained 831 Tibetans as political prisoners; of these 831 prisoners, 12 are serving life sentences and 9 were sentenced to death.

In 2009 Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was imprisoned for advocating democratic reforms and increased freedom of speech in Charter 08. In 2017 he died in prison from late stage liver cancer at the age of 61.

Other political prisoners include journalist Tan Zuoren, human rights activist Xu Zhiyong, and journalist Shi Tao. Tan Zuoren was arrested in 2010 and sentenced to 5 years in prison after publicly speaking about government corruption as well as the poorly constructed school buildings that collapsed and led to the deaths of thousands of children during the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan. Xu Zhiyong was sentenced to four years in prison in 2014 after gaining a significant social media following and using it as a platform to express his sociopolitical opinions. Shi Tao was sentenced to 8 years after publicizing the list of instructions that the Communist Party sent journalists regarding how to report the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

====Pro-democracy movements====
Some people have campaigned against the one-party Communist rule in mainland China over the years.

===Freedom of assembly and association===
The freedom of assembly is provided by the Article 35 of the Chinese Constitution. The Article 51, however, restricts its exercise: such right «&quot;may not infringe upon the interests of the state&quot;».

Human rights activists such as Xie Xang fight for the rights of Chinese people by protesting, slandering the governments&#x27; names on social media, and by filing lawsuits. Xang has commented on the punishment he received for protesting, claiming that he was interrogated while shackled onto a metal chair, forced to sit in stressful positions for a set amount of time, and tortured physically and mentally. He also quoted his interrogators stating that he was told that &quot;I could torture you to death and no one could help you.&quot;

===Freedom of movement and privacy===

In 2010, in response to Chunyun (increase in traffic movements due to Chinese New Year), which has caused various problems with tickets prices (due to resale by speculative traders), a system similar to blogs-related real-name identification system was introduced on nine railroad stations. It requires the transport companies to demand far-travellers to provide their name for their tickets. Several critics and media have raised concerns about its possible privacy violations and freedom of movement rights restrictions risks.

==One-child policy (1979-2015)==
The Chinese government&#x27;s birth control policy, known widely as the one-child policy, was implemented in 1979 by chairman Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s government to alleviate the overpopulation problem. Having more than one child was illegal and punishable by fines. This policy was replaced with a two-child policy in 2015. In May 2021, the policy was further relaxed to a three child policy, and all restrictions were removed in July 2021.

In 2005, Voice of America cited critics who argued that the one-child policy contributed to forced abortions, human rights violations, female infanticide, abandonment, and sex-selective abortions, which are believed to be relatively commonplace in some areas of the country. Sex-selective abortions are thought to have been a significant contribution to the gender imbalance in mainland China, where there is a 118:100 ratio of male to female children reported. Forced abortions and sterilizations have also been reported.

Chinese state-run media reported on 3 June 2013 that the city of Wuhan was considering legislation to fine women who have children out of wedlock, or with men who were already married. The fine was considered a &#x27;social compensation fee&#x27;, and has been sharply criticized for potentially exacerbating the problem of abandoned children.

==Capital punishment==
According to Amnesty International, throughout the 1990s more people were executed or sentenced to death in China than in the rest of the world put together.

Officially, the death penalty in mainland China is only administered to offenders who commit serious and violent crimes, such as aggravated murder, but China retains in law a number of nonviolent death penalty offences such as drug trafficking. The People&#x27;s Republic of China administers more official death penalties than any other country, though other countries (such as Iran and Singapore) have higher official execution rates. Reliable NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights in China have informed the public that the total execution numbers, with unofficial death penalties included, greatly exceed officially recorded executions; in 2009, the Dui Hua Foundation estimated that 5,000 people were executed in China – far more than all other nations combined. The precise number of executions is regarded as a state secret.

PRC authorities have recently been pursuing measures to reduce the official number of crimes punishable by death and limit how much they officially utilize the death penalty. In 2011, the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee adopted an amendment to reduce the number of capital crimes from 68 to 55.

The death penalty is one of the classical Five Punishments of the Chinese Dynasties. In Chinese philosophy, the death penalty was supported by the Legalists, but its application was tempered by the Confucianists, who preferred rehabilitation over punishment of any sort, including capital punishment. In Communist philosophy, Vladimir Lenin urged the retention of the death penalty, while Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels claimed that the practice was feudal and a symbol of capitalist oppression. Chairman Mao of the CCP and his government retained the death penalty&#x27;s place in the legal system, while advocating that it be used for a limited number of counterrevolutionaries. The market reformer Deng Xiaoping after him stressed that the practice must not be abolished, and advocated its wider use against recidivists and corrupt officials. Leaders of the PRC&#x27;s minor, non-communist parties have also advocated for greater use of the death penalty. Both Deng and Mao viewed the death penalty as having tremendous popular support, and portrayed the practice as a means to &#x27;assuage the people&#x27;s anger&#x27;.

The death penalty has widespread support in mainland China, especially for violent crimes, and no group in government or civil society vocally advocates for its abolition. Surveys conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 1995, for instance, found that 95 per cent of the Chinese population supported the death penalty, and these results were mirrored in other studies. Polling conducted in 2007 in Beijing, Hunan, and Guangdong found a more moderate 58 per cent in favour of the death penalty, and further found that a majority (63.8 per cent) believed that the government should release execution statistics to the public.

A total of 46 crimes are punishable by death, including some non-violent, white-collar crimes such as embezzlement and tax fraud. Execution methods include lethal injections and shooting. The People&#x27;s Armed Police carries out the executions, usually at 10:00 am.

Death sentences in post-Maoist mainland China can be politically or socially influenced. In 2003, a local court sentenced the leader of a triad society to a death sentence with two years of probation. However, the public opinion was that the sentence was too light. Under public pressure, the supreme court of Communist China took the case and retried the leader, resulting in a death sentence, which was carried out immediately.

===Execution protocol===
The execution protocol is defined in criminal procedure law, under article 212:

In some areas of mainland China, there is no specific execution ground. A scout team chooses a place in advance to serve as the execution ground. In such a case, the execution ground normally will have three perimeters: the innermost 50meters is the responsibility of the execution team; the 200-meter radius from the center is the responsibility of the People&#x27;s Armed Police; and the 2-kilometer alert line is the responsibility of the local police. The public is generally forbidden to view the execution.

The role of the executioner was fulfilled in the past by the People&#x27;s Armed Police. In recent times, the People&#x27;s Courts’ judicial police officers () assumed this role.

Since 1949, the most common method of execution has been execution by shooting. This method has been largely superseded by lethal injection, using the same three-drug cocktail pioneered by the United States, introduced in 1996. Execution vans are unique to mainland China, however. Lethal injection is more commonly used for &#x27;economic crimes&#x27; such as corruption, while shooting are used for more common crimes like murder. In 2010, Chinese authorities moved to have lethal injection become the dominant form of execution; in some provinces and municipalities, it is now the only legal form of capital punishment. The Dui Hua foundation notes that it is impossible to ascertain whether these guidelines are closely followed, as the method of execution is rarely specified in published reports.

===Criticism===
Human rights groups and foreign governments have heavily criticized the PRC&#x27;s use of the death penalty for a variety of reasons, including its application for non-violent offences, allegations of the use of torture to extract confessions, legal proceedings that do not meet international standards, and the government&#x27;s failure to publish statistics on the death penalty. However, as acknowledged by both the Chinese Supreme Court and the United States Department of State, the vast majority of death sentences are given for violent, nonpolitical crimes which would be considered serious in other countries.

The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong has accused Chinese hospitals of using the organs of executed prisoners for commercial transplantation. Under Chinese law, condemned prisoners must give written consent to become organ donors, but because of this and other legal restrictions on organ donation, an international black market in organs and cadavers from China has developed. In 2009, Chinese authorities acknowledged that two-thirds of organ transplants in the country could be traced back to executed prisoners and announced a crackdown on the practice.

====United States====

Running for president in 1992, Bill Clinton sharply criticized his predecessor George H. W. Bush for prioritizing profitable trade relationships over human rights issues in mainland China. As president, 1993–2001, however, Clinton backed away from his position. He did articulate a desired set of goals for mainland China. They included free emigration, no exportation of goods made with prison labour, release of peaceful protesters, treatment of prisoners in terms of international standards, recognition of the distinct regional culture of Tibet, permitting international television and radio coverage, and observation of human rights specified by United Nations resolutions. China refused to comply, and by summer 1994 Clinton admitted defeat and called for a renewal of normalized trade relations. However congressional pressure, especially from Republicans, forced Clinton to approve arms sales to Taiwan, despite the strong displeasure voiced by Beijing. In 2020, president Donald Trump praised China&#x27;s use of the death penalty.

===Wrongful executions===
An estimate of over 1000 people are executed every year in mainland China. Most of these executions are due to crimes that are seen as intolerable to the society within mainland China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. There are some cases that have been held wrongly.

At least four people have been considered wrongfully executed by PRC courts.

*Wei Qing&#x27;an (, circa 1951 1984) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for the rape of Liu, a woman who had disappeared. The execution was carried out on 3 May 1984 by the Intermediate People&#x27;s Court. In the next month, Tian Yuxiu () was arrested and admitted that he had committed the rape. Three years later, Wei was officially declared innocent.
*Teng Xingshan (, ? 1989) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for having raped, robbed and murdered Shi Xiaorong (), a woman who had disappeared. An old man found a dismembered body, and police forensics claimed to have matched the body to the photo of the missing Shi Xiaorong. The execution was carried out on 28 January 1989 by the Huaihua Intermediate People&#x27;s Court. In 1993, the missing woman returned to the village, saying she had been kidnapped to Shandong. The absolute innocence of the executed Teng was not admitted until 2005.
*Nie Shubin (, 1974 1995) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for the rape and murder of Kang Juhua (), a woman in her thirties. The execution was carried out on 27 April 1995 by the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People&#x27;s Court. In 2005, ten years after the execution, Wang Shujin () admitted to the police that he had committed the murder. Therefore, it has been indicated that Nie Shubin had been innocent all along.

==Torture==
Although the People&#x27;s Republic of China outlawed torture in 1996, human rights groups say brutality and degradation are common in Chinese arbitrary detention centers, Laojiao prisons, and black jails. People who are imprisoned for their political views, human rights activities, or religious beliefs have a high risk of being tortured. Strategies of torture inside black jail include deprivation of sleep, food, and medication. The strategies are all quite inhumane conditions. In a specific case, a woman named Huang Yan was imprisoned for her political views and included the deprivation of medication. She had diabetes and ovarian cancer which required her to take medication. Tests have shown that the ovarian cancer have spread throughout her body. While the existence of black jails is acknowledged by at least part of the government, the CCP strongly denies facilitating the operation of such jails and officially cracks down on them, leading to at least one trial.

In May 2010, the PRC authorities officially passed new regulations in an attempt to nullify evidence gathered through violence or intimidation in their official judicial procedures, and to reduce the level of torture administered to prisoners already in jails. Little is known, however, about whether or how procedures were modified in black jails, which are not officially part of the judicial system. The move came after a public outcry following the revelation that a farmer, convicted for murder based on his confession under torture, was in fact innocent. The case came to light only when his alleged victim was found alive, after the defendant had spent ten years in prison. International human rights groups gave the change a cautious welcome.

Torture is reportedly used as part of the indoctrination process at the Xinjiang internment camps. The torture is alleged to include waterboarding and sexual violence.

==Ethnic minorities==
There are 55 officially recognized native ethnic minorities in China. Article 4 of the Chinese constitution states &#x27;All nationalities in the People&#x27;s Republic of China are equal&#x27;, and the government argues that it has made efforts to improve ethnic education and increased ethnic representation in local government. Some groups are still fighting for recognition as minorities. In the 1964 Census, there were 183 nationalities registered, of which the government recognized 54.

Some policies cause reverse racism, in which Han Chinese and even ethnic minorities from other regions of China are treated as second-class citizens in the region which is inhabited by a Han Chinese majority. Similarly, there are wide-ranging preferential policies (affirmative action programs) in place to promote social and economic development for ethnic minorities, including preferential employment, political appointments, and business loans. Universities typically have quotas reserved for ethnic minorities, even if they have lower admission test scores. Ethnic minorities are also more often exempt from the one-child policy, which targets the Han Chinese.

Stern punishments of independence-seeking demonstrators, rioters, or terrorists have led to mistreatment of the Tibetan and Uyghur minorities in Western China. The United States in 2007 refused to help repatriate five Chinese Uyghur Guantanamo Bay detainees because of &#x27;past treatment of the Uigur minority&#x27;. In its 2007 annual report to the U.S. Congress, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China said the Chinese government &quot;provides incentives for migration to the region from elsewhere in China.&quot; Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (paramount leader), said in April 2014 that China faces increasing threats to national security and the government could impose tougher controls on its ethnic minorities due to terrorist attacks like the 2014 Kunming attack. In Xinjiang, the Ürümqi Motorized Vehicle Licensing and Testing Department has begun requiring all ethnic Uyghur and Kazakh individuals to undergo a background check before registering a vehicle.

In March 2019, the United States Department of State criticized mainland China for its human rights violations, saying the sort of abuses it had inflicted on its Muslim minorities had not been witnessed &quot;since the 1930s&quot;. The department&#x27;s annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices stated that the PRC was &quot;in a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations&quot;.

==Forcible biometrics collection==
PRC authorities in western Xinjiang province are collecting DNA samples, fingerprints, eye scans, and blood types of millions of people aged 12 to 65. Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch&#x27;s China director, said &quot;the mandatory databanking of a whole population&#x27;s biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it&#x27;s even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program.&quot; For the ethnic minority Uyghur people, it is mandatory to undergo the biometrics collection, disguised under physical examination. Coercion to give blood samples is a gross violation of human rights and individual privacy.

==Right to development==
In Chinese policymakers&#x27; perspective, the right to development is the primary and most fundamental human right. According to this view, poverty is the greatest obstacle to human rights because without the production and supply of material goods it is difficult to realize any other human right. As a means to reduce poverty, development therefore provides the necessary conditions for other rights.

In 1986, China voted in favor of the United Nations &quot;Declaration on the Right to Development&quot;, through which that right became internationally established.

China was among the drafters of the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and its resolution -- &quot;the contribution of development to the enjoyment of all human rights&quot;—was adopted by the UN Human Rights Council.

In 2016, China issued a white paper titled, &quot;The Right to Development: China&#x27;s Philosophy, Practice, and Contribution&quot;. The white paper emphasizes the view that the rights to development and subsistence are the primary, basic human rights.

==Economic and property rights==

The National People&#x27;s Congress enacted a law in 2007 to protect private property, with the exception of land. Nevertheless, according to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine, local Chinese authorities have used brutal means to expropriate property, in a bid to profit from the construction boom.

==Rights related to sexuality==

In 2001, homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental illnesses in China. China recognizes neither same-sex marriage nor civil unions.

According to the criminal law of the PRC, only females can be victims of rape, a man who has been raped cannot make accusations against either men or women of rape. However, the criminal law of the PRC&#x27;s constitution in mainland China had been amended in August 2015. Thus, males can be victims of indecency, but the articles on the criminal law which are related to rape still remain unrevised, so male victims can only make accusations of indecency.

==Intersex rights==

Intersex people in China suffer discrimination, lack of access to health care and coercive genital surgeries.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the Chinese government censored online criticism of its response to the pandemic, including criticism of its lockdown measures.

==Other human rights issues==

Workers&#x27; rights and privacy are contentious human rights issues in China. There have been several reports of core International Labour Organization conventions being denied to workers. One such report was released by the International Labor Rights Fund in October 2006; it documented minimum wage violations, long work hours, and inappropriate actions toward workers by management. Workers cannot form their own unions in the workplace; they may only join state-sanctioned ones. The extent to which these organizations can fight for the rights of Chinese workers is disputed.

The policy toward refugees from North Korea is a recurring human rights issue. It is official policy to repatriate these refugees to North Korea, but the policy is not evenly enforced and a considerable number of them stay in the People&#x27;s Republic. Though it is in contravention of international law to deport political refugees, as illegal immigrants their situation is precarious. Their rights are not always protected, and some are tricked into marriage, forced to engage in cybersex or prostitution, allegedly linked to criminal networks generating an estimated annual revenue of $105,000,000 US.

African students in China have complained about their treatment in China.

Their complaints largely ignored until 19889, when &#x27;students rose up in protest against what they called &quot;Chinese apartheid. African officials took notice of the issue, and the Organization of African Unity issued an official protest. The organization&#x27;s chairman, President Moussa Traoré of Mali, went on a fact-finding mission to China. A 1989 report in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &#x27;these practices could threaten Peking&#x27;s entire relationship with the continent.&#x27;

The United Nations reports that it has had difficulty in arranging official visits to China by UN Special Rapporteurs on various human rights issues.

On 9 September 2020, a global coalition of 321 civil society groups, including &quot;Amnesty International&quot;, urged United Nations to urgently create an independent international mechanism to address the Chinese government&#x27;s human rights violations. In an open letter, the organizations highlighted China&#x27;s rights violations worldwide, including the targeting of human rights defenders, global censorship and surveillance, and rights-free development that caused environmental degradation.

On 6 October 2020, 39 United Nations member countries expressed deep concerns over China&#x27;s human rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet. The call was made by Germany, supported by Britain, Canada, the United States, many European Union member states, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haiti, Honduras, Palau, and the Marshall Islands.

A report published by Human Rights Watch in August 2021 documents the economic, social, and cultural rights violations resulting from the China-financed hydroelectric dam construction in northeastern Cambodia. Nearly 5,000 people have been displaced due to the dam&#x27;s construction.

The World report 2022 by &quot;Human Rights Watch&quot; stated that the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Xi Jinping celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2021 amid crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and the devastation of civil liberties in Hong Kong. In 2021 the Chinese government tightened ideological control and increasingly cracked down on free speech. The Chinese government also moved quickly to offer support to Afghanistan&#x27;s abusive Taliban-controlled government.

==Position of the government==
The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China has argued that its concept of &#x27;Asian values&#x27; requires that the welfare of the collective should always be put ahead of the rights of any individual whenever conflicts between these arise. Its position is that the government has the responsibility to design, implement, and enforce a &#x27;harmonious socialist society&#x27;.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China emphasizes state sovereignty, which at times conflicts with the international norms or standards of human rights. However, its concept of human rights has developed radically over the years. From 1949 to the late 1970s, the CCP focused on promoting the rights of the masses: collective rights rather than individual human rights. Deng Xiaoping said that the right of a nation, or sovereignty (&quot;guoquan&quot;) is more important than human rights (&quot;renquan&quot;), and right of subsistence (&quot;shengcun quan&quot;) is more fundamental than political freedom. However, from the beginning of economic reforms in 1978 to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, the CCP raised concerns for human rights in their domestic and international policies. In 1991, China officially accepted the idea that human rights were compatible with Chinese socialism, and in 1993 the state created the China Society for Human Rights Studies, which has represented Chinese positions on human rights in international forums, conferences, and media. China went on to sign two treaties – the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The ICESCR was ratified by the National People&#x27;s Congress in 2001, but as of 2016, the ICCPR has not yet been ratified. , the PRC had signed more than 20 international treaties on human rights.

===Western human rights===
Those who agree with the Chinese Communist Party point toward what they call rapid deterioration in Western societies, claiming that there has been an increase in geographic, religious, and racial segregation, rising crime rates, family breakdown, industrial action, vandalism, and political extremism within Western societies. The European Union and the United Nations claim to be stopping these types of human rights violations, save for a few violations committed by some Western governments (e.g. the CIA&#x27;s extraordinary rendition programme). The PRC holds the opinion, though, that many alleged negatives about democratic society are a direct result of an excess of individual freedom, saying that too much freedom is dangerous. The PRC holds that these actions in Western nations are all violations of human rights. They say that these should be taken into account when assessing a country&#x27;s human rights record. On occasion they have criticized the United States policies, especially the human rights reports published by its State Department. They cite the opinion that the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, has also violated human rights laws, for example during the invasion of Iraq.

In United Nations bodies, China argues for a way of looking at the concept of universal human rights that differs from the Western view. China&#x27;s view is that a focus on political rights and values is a too narrow view of human rights, and should instead focus on economic outcomes, material well-being of people, and national sovereignty.

===Chinese definition===
Chinese state media has stated that human rights should encompass what its officials have labelled as &quot;economic standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity&quot;.

===Measures taken===
In March 2003, an amendment was officially made to the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, officially stating that &#x27;The State respects and preserves human rights.&#x27; In addition, China was dropped from a list of top ten human rights violators in the annual human rights report released by the U.S. State Department in 2008, though the report indicated that there were still widespread human rights-related issues in the PRC.

In 1988, the People&#x27;s Republic of China began direct village elections to help maintain social and political order while facing rapid economic change. Elections now occur in about 650,000 villages across China, reaching 75% of the nation&#x27;s 1.3 billion people, according to the Carter Center. In 2008, Shenzhen, which enjoys the highest per capita GDP in mainland China, was selected for experimentation, and over 70% of the government officials on the district level are to be directly elected (as of 2008). However, in keeping with Communist Party philosophy, candidates must be selected from a pre-approved list.

<doc id="217488" wikidata="Q7828787" url="?curid=217488" title="Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn">
<text>Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn was a comedy talk show that aired on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2004. The show featured host Colin Quinn and a panel of comedian guests, discussing politics, current events, and social issues.

==Show history and format==
In 2002, comedian Colin Quinn was given his own show on NBC, titled &quot;The Colin Quinn Show&quot;, which was broadcast live from the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; soundstage in New York City. The show only lasted for three episodes. Each of these three episodes aired on successive Mondays from March 11, 2002 to March 25, 2002.

Although NBC canceled the show, Quinn took a similarly-themed show to Comedy Central later on that year. On December 9, 2002, &quot;Tough Crowd With Colin Quinn&quot; debuted on Comedy Central with an eight-episode test series, which ran Mondays through Thursdays, until December 19, 2002. The show was picked up in January 2003, and the regular series began its 21-week run on March 10, 2003. The show aired weeknights at 11:30 p.m. ET, immediately following &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;.

The show was presented as an alternative, unpolished and more accessible political &quot;round-table&quot; discussion/shouting-match program in the manner of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, taking cue from Bill Maher&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;. The guests on the panel were usually comedians who had been given topics in advance on which to prepare material. Quinn&#x27;s regular guests consisted mainly of Comedy Central affiliated comedians from the Comedy Cellar comedy club in New York City. The club was renowned for its postperformance roundtable discussions with comedians in the audience about political issues. These exchanges were the inspiration for &quot;Tough Crowd&quot;.

The show would open with a monologue by Quinn. Quinn would then stand in front of a pool table, or sit on the edge of it, very often sipping coffee, eating or perusing through a newspaper. Usually, there were four comedians as guests, but sometimes three or five. Quinn would introduce current events and moderate the discussion, which would take up most of the episode. Near the end of each episode, there was usually a sketch of some sort, followed by each of the guests doing a brief monologue on a particular topic that was discussed earlier in the episode.

==Regular guests==
The show featured many different comedians, including well-known comics such as George Carlin and Jerry Seinfeld and Kevin Hart, but the core group that was regularly rotated into the show&#x27;s panels and often paired together was:

* Nick DiPaolo
* Greg Giraldo
* Jim Norton
* Patrice O&#x27;Neal
* Rich Vos
* Keith Robinson
* Judy Gold

On September 26, 2003, Comedy Central aired an hour-long &quot;Tough Crowd&quot; themed stand-up comedy special called &quot;Tough Crowd Stands Up&quot; hosted by Quinn and featuring stand-up sets from the show&#x27;s 5 regulars: DiPaolo, Giraldo, Norton, O&#x27;Neal, and Vos.

==Episodes==
*Some episodes and guest lineups are missing, and many specific dates are unknown.

==Series finale and epilogue==
Jim Norton addressed the program&#x27;s demise on his blog, where he mentioned that Comedy Central would send down notes to the show discouraging the predominant focus on political topics and discussions about race and ethnic issues. The network claimed this was only because they already had scripted/talk programming that addressed these issues, referring to &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; and &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, and warned that some of the views expressed on &quot;Tough Crowd&quot; did not appeal to the demographics at which Comedy Central&#x27;s current business model was aimed.

The last show contained emotional monologues by Quinn, who attacked his detractors (such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;) as being hypocritical and elitist for their negative reviews. He also defined &quot;comedic integrity&quot; as the ability to critique the hypocrisy of society, but to be honest enough to admit that you are just as guilty of it as anyone else. The implication was that many political comedians spend all their time criticizing society and others, but rarely themselves.
