Driver also made her stage debut in 1991, supplementing her income by performing as a jazz vocalist and guitarist. In 1993 she featured in an episode of &quot;Maigret&quot;, alongside Michael Gambon and Michael Sheen. Also in 1993, she played alongside Jonathan Pryce in the mini-series &quot;Mr Wroe&#x27;s Virgins&quot;. She appeared in &quot;The Day Today&quot;, on British television, with comedian Steve Coogan and for satirist Armando Iannucci, and had small parts in &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;The House of Eliott&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot; and &quot;Peak Practice&quot;. 

Driver gained broader public attention when she played the lead role in &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; in 1995, opposite Chris O&#x27;Donnell. She followed this with a minor role in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995), a supporting role in &quot;Sleepers&quot; (1996), a leading role in &quot;Big Night&quot; (1996), and as a co-star in &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997), opposite John Cusack.

Driver played opposite Matt Damon as Skylar in the drama &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

In 1998, Driver starred in Sandra Goldbacher&#x27;s film &quot;The Governess&quot;. That year, she co-starred opposite Christian Slater and Morgan Freeman in the action thriller &quot;Hard Rain&quot;. Driver has also worked on several animated features, voicing Jane in Disney&#x27;s 1999 version of &quot;Tarzan&quot; and Lady Eboshi in the 1999 English-dubbed release of the Japanese film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. In 2003 and 2004, she had a recurring role on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; as Lorraine Finster, the nemesis of Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) and daughter of Karen&#x27;s lover, Lyle Finster (John Cleese).

In March 2007, Driver made her return to television in the FX Network show &quot;The Riches&quot;. She was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award as Best Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2007 and 2008, respectively. She was scheduled to appear in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, although her appearance was cut from the final version. Driver appeared in the January 2010 episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot; entitled &quot;Moon Landing&quot;. She also starred in the television series &quot;The Deep&quot; and appeared in &quot;Conviction&quot;, in the comedy drama &quot;Barney&#x27;s Version&quot;, winning a Genie Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In October 2013, Driver started filming for &quot;The Crash&quot; which was released on 13 January 2017.

Driver landed the lead role in the ABC sitcom &quot;Speechless&quot;, playing the mother of three children, one of whom has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. The series debuted in the 2016–17 TV season. It was cancelled in May 2019 after three seasons.

===Music===

Driver began making music at boarding school. She collaborated on Bomb the Bass&#x27;s album &quot;Clear&quot;, in 1994, as part of the outfit River. She was part of the Milo Roth Band, which received a recording contract when she was 19. In 2001 she signed with EMI and Rounder Records and performed at the SXSW music festival. The title song of &quot;Everything I&#x27;ve Got in My Pocket&quot;, her first album, reached No. 34 in the U.K., and the song &quot;Invisible Girl&quot; peaked at No. 68. Driver wrote 10 of the 11 songs on the album. In 2004, Driver was the supporting act for the Finn Brothers on the U.K. portion of their world tour.

In 2004, Driver played Carlotta Giudicelli in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s film &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, based on the musical of the same name by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Driver sang &quot;Learn to be Lonely&quot;, an original song written for the film by Lloyd Webber. However, because of her lack of opera experience, all her songs as Carlotta were dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece. Driver released her second album, &quot;Seastories&quot;, in July 2007, featuring guest appearances by Ryan Adams, the Cardinals and Liz Phair. Driver released a third album in October 2014 called &quot;Ask Me to Dance&quot; that includes songs by Elliott Smith, Neil Young and The Killers.

She has a son named Henry, born in 2008, from a brief relationship with television writer and producer Timothy J. Lea. In 1997, she began dating Matt Damon while filming &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. The two split in early 1998.

In 2016, Driver revealed that she was sexually assaulted at age 17 while on holiday in Greece.

On 21 December 2017, Driver became a United States citizen. After living in California for a number of years, Driver moved back to London.

In the Gymnasium (AHS), which, as opposed to vocational schools, focuses on general education, the &quot;Matura&quot; consists of three to four written exams (referred to as &quot;Klausurarbeiten&quot;, four to five hours each) to be taken on consecutive mornings (usually in May) and two to three oral exams to be taken on the same half-day about a month later (usually in June); The higher vocational education schools (BHS) such as HBLAs, HTLs, and HTBLAs follow a similar format. All examinations are held at the school which the candidate last attended. Candidates have the option to write a scholarly paper (called &quot;Fachbereichsarbeit &quot;) to be submitted at the beginning of the February preceding the final exams, which, if accepted, counts as a subject and must be defended in a corresponding oral exam.

The grading system is the one universally used in Austrian schools: &quot;1&quot; (&quot;sehr gut&quot;) is excellent; &quot;2&quot; (&quot;gut&quot;) is good; &quot;3&quot; (&quot;befriedigend&quot;) is satisfactory; &quot;4&quot; (&quot;genügend&quot;) is passed and &quot;5&quot; (&quot;nicht genügend&quot;) means that the candidate has failed. In addition, a candidate&#x27;s &quot;Maturazeugnis&quot; contains a formalized overall assessment: &quot;&quot;mit ausgezeichnetem Erfolg bestanden&quot; (pass with distinction: an average of 1.5 or better, no grade above 3), &quot;mit gutem Erfolg bestanden&quot; (pass with merit: an average of 2.0 or better, no grade above 3), &quot;bestanden&quot; (pass: no grade above 4); and &#x27;&quot;nicht bestanden&quot;&quot; (fail: at least one grade 5). Candidates who have failed may re-take their exams in September/October or February/March of the following school year.

Compulsory subjects for the written finals are always German and Mathematics, as well as a foreign language (usually English, French, Spanish, Italian, Latin or sometimes Ancient Greek). Schools with a focus on science may require their students to take written finals in Biology or Physics.

The Austrian &quot;Matura&quot; used to be a decentralized affair, however since 2014 tests in Mathematics, German and foreign languages are now centralized and held at the same day throughout Austria. There is only one external examiner: candidates are set tasks both for their written and oral finals by their own (former) teachers. Formally, however, there is an examination board consisting of a candidate&#x27;s teachers/examiners, the headmaster/headmistress and one external &quot;Vorsitzende(r)&quot; (head), usually a high-ranking school official or the head of another school. Oral exams are held publicly, but attendance by anyone other than a candidate&#x27;s former schoolmates is not encouraged, and indeed rare.

It is possible for Austrians of all age groups to take the Matura. Adults from their twenties on are usually tutored at private institutions of adult education before taking their final tests, held separately before a regional examination board.

==== The new centralized Matura (Zentralmatura) ====
In 2015, the old Matura system was replaced by a new concept called &quot;Zentralmatura&quot; (centralized Matura). Graduation exams are now put together by &quot;bifie&quot; (an institution for research in education) and every graduation exam in Austria is now held on the same day. However, the teachers still correct all the exams themselves using an answer sheet that is included in the exam packages.

Students can still choose either four or three written exams (maths, German and one foreign language are compulsory; one additional language can also be chosen). When students choose three written exams, they will have to do another three oral exams. When choosing four written exams, only two additional oral exams are necessary.

What is also new is that every student now has to write a graduation paper called &quot;VWA&quot; (&quot;Vorwissenschaftliche Arbeit&quot; or, literally translated, &quot;Pre-scientific paper&quot;). They can choose any topic they want, usually one year before graduating. When they have finished writing it (it should usually be 30.000 to 60.000 characters long), they have to present it to teachers and to the head (&quot;Vorsitzende(r)&quot;). The &quot;VWA&quot; is another grade in the &quot;Maturazeugnis&quot;.

=== Bulgaria ===
In Bulgarian the matura is formally called &quot;държавен зрелостен изпит&quot; (Romanization: &quot;darzhaven zrelosten izpit&quot;, State Maturity Exam) or ДЗИ (DZI), but usually it is called simply &quot;матура&quot;. There is only one compulsory subject – &quot;Bulgarian Language and Literature&quot;, but students are required to select an additional subject of their choice; they can also request a third and fourth subject. Each exam consists of a single written test. The second subject must be chosen between:
* A foreign language (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian)
* Mathematics
* Physics and astronomy
* Biology and health education
* Chemistry and environmental science
* History and civilization
* Geography and economics
* cycle of &quot;Philosophy&quot;
* Information Technology

In 2008, according to the statistics on the web site of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education, 76,013 students have registered for the matura exams. Of them only 1748 students registered for a third, voluntary subject. Only 845 of them passed the third examination successfully. Because of the exam&#x27;s challenging nature, students who request a third subject have a significant advantage in the university admissions process.

=== Croatia ===

The nationwide leaving exams (&quot;državna matura&quot;) were introduced for gymnasium (and other four-year high school programme) students in the school year 2009/2010. The examinations are conducted by the National Center for External Evaluation of Education (&quot;Nacionalni centar za vanjsko vrednovanje obrazovanja&quot; – NCVVO). There are two available terms during which candidates can take their exams: the summer term, taking place usually during June, and the fall term, typically occurring during September. Many university faculties and other higher-education institutions already have their applications closed by the end of the summer term due to having reached their first-year students enrollment quota for the upcoming academic year.

The compulsory subjects are available at the basic (B) or higher (A) level exams. Certain higher-education institutions require the candidate to take certain or all compulsory subject exams at the A level. On the other hand, there are higher-education programmes requiring only the B level exams. In such cases, the candidate taking an exam in a certain subject on the A level is credited more points than a candidate taking the B level exam: 1 point of the A level exam is worth 1.6 points of the B level exam.

The three compulsory subjects are:
* Croatian (or Serbian, Hungarian, Italian or Czech for minorities), 
* Mathematics,
* a foreign language (English, German, Italian, Spanish or French). Students can only take the exam in a language that they had a positive grade in for at least two years of their high school education. Students of classical gymnasiums are therefore also able to choose Latin or Ancient Greek instead of (or in addition to) a modern foreign language.

The Croatian language exam has two parts: literature written exam, and an essay. The literature exam is composed mostly of the multiple choice assignments and matching questions assignments, whereas the essay part of the exam requires an essay ranging from 400 to 600 words written with notable understanding of a given literature text.

The literature appearing in the exam changes annually; however, the list of works that can appear remains the same. The B level exam literature list consists of the following: Camus&#x27; The Stranger, Cesarić&#x27;s Lirika, Gundulić&#x27;s Dubravka, Ibsen&#x27;s A Doll&#x27;s House, Krleža&#x27;s The Glembays, Matoš&#x27;s Pjesme, Novak&#x27;s Posljednji Stipančići, and Sophocles&#x27; Antigone. The A level works are: Camus&#x27; Stranger, Dostoyevsky&#x27;s Crime and Punishment, Držić&#x27;s Dundo Maroje, Flaubert&#x27;s Madame Bovary, Goethe&#x27;s The Sorrows of Young Werther, Kafka&#x27;s The Metamorphosis, Krleža&#x27;s The Glembays and The Return of Filip Latinovicz, Marinković&#x27;s Ruke, Nehajev&#x27;s Bijeg, Poe&#x27;s The Black Cat, Salinger&#x27;s The Catcher in the Rye, Sophocles&#x27; Antigone, Šimić&#x27;s Preobraženja, and Šoljan&#x27;s Kratki izlet.

The optional subjects are Biology, Chemistry, Computer science, Ethics, Geography, History, Logics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Politics, Psychology, Religious studies, Sociology, and Visual arts. Optional subjects are available only at a single level. A gymnasium student is considered to have finished their high school education program upon passing only the three compulsory subjects (alongside fulfilling the other prerequisites set by their high school); if a student fails a Matura exam on an optional subject, that subject simply will not be listed on their certificate.

Students receive their exams in sealed opaque silver bags which they personally open typically by piercing the top with a pen and thus breaking the seal. Inside they get the exam booklet, the answer sheet (used for scanning students&#x27; answers for faster grading process), a concept booklet, a new opaque silver bag, and a piece of paper with barcode stickers used for candidate identification. Before they start taking the exam, students need to stick the barcodes on every booklet, paper and bag that they received. At the end, students gather all the examination material and seal it in the opaque silver bag they had received, which will then be sent back to NCVVO for grading. The answers of the exam questions are published typically two days after the exam day.

Examinees are allowed to file a complaint on grading, or even on the exam questions. On the 2012 Croatian language exam, a total of 7 exam questions were nullified due to multiple possible interpretations of the source text and the indiscrimination by the examinees shown by the psychometric analysis.

Further enrollment into higher education is conducted on-line via the National Computer System for Applications for Higher Education Institutions (&quot;Nacionalni informacijski sustav prijava na visoka učilišta&quot; – NISpVU). Each candidate has the right to attempt to enroll at a maximum of 10 colleges, faculties, schools, and academies of universities, or other types of higher-education institutions. Lists of students with the right to enrollment are processed by the central computers of each institution&#x27;s division. The rank is formed based on Matura exams points and optional additional criteria or extra points set by the institution that ranks the applicants, for example, admission exams, or GPA of final grades of each year in certain or all high school subjects.

For example, for a domestic student to enroll at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, the following criteria needs to be met: they have acquired at least 55% on the compulsory admission exam (select advanced areas in Chemistry, Biology and Physics), and they have passed the A level exams of the compulsory Matura subjects. Their final points are then calculated based on the following:
* the compulsory admission exam (60%),
* the A level Matura exams: Croatian (10%), Mathematics (4%), foreign language (10%),
* grade point average in all high school subjects (16%).

=== Czech Republic ===
The official term for matura in the Czech Republic is &quot;maturita&quot; or &quot;maturitní zkouška&quot;. In 2010, the Czech Republic introduced a system of state exams, which divided the previous system into two parts. The first is the state exam, which consists of two compulsory subjects: &quot;Czech language and literature&quot; and either a foreign language (mostly English, but also German, Russian, Spanish or French) or mathematics (the combination is chosen by students). The second part consists of Czech language and literature and at least two, but usually three, &quot;profile&quot; subjects, which vary between schools. Gymnázium (similar to grammar school) students usually choose from:
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Foreign language
* Geography
* History
* Information Technologies
* Mathematics
* Physics
* Social Sciences (usually includes psychology, sociology, economics, law, political science, philosophy and international relations)

The state part of the exam is supervised by CERMAT (formerly &quot;Centrum pro reformu maturitní zkoušky&quot;, &quot;Centre for Maturita Reform; now &quot;Centrum pro zjišťování výsledků vzdělávání&quot;, &quot;Centre for Determination of Education Results&quot;), a state managed company. CERMAT issues final tests for the state part of the exam, documentation and practical tests, holds training for teachers who correct essays and supervise the students during the exams. The main part of the company is the tech centre, which is used for auto correcting the students exams. State exams are subject to continual improvement. Today the tests consist of four exams from which two are state organized and two school organized, in the future the state wants to add at least one more state exam and one more compulsory school exam.

In 2012 the state part of the &quot;maturita&quot; exam was split into two difficulty levels – students could choose between basic and advanced tests. This solution was found to be ineffective and was canceled the following year.

The Czech Republic also has a separate examination system called &quot;Národní srovnávací zkoušky&quot; (&quot;National Comparative Test&quot;), owned and managed by the private company Scio, s.r.o. which provides tests for all subjects. Some Czech universities recognize the results of these tests and students can be accepted based on these results, however, they still have to succeed in the &quot;maturita&quot; exam.

The examination itself is also divided between written and oral parts but not all subjects require both written and spoken input (for example math is formed by a written test only). Usually both the written and the oral part of the exam are set in late spring. The state part of the written exam is set to one day in which students in the whole country write identical tests, different tests are always issued on the day the exam takes place. The school (profile) part is always different and is based on requirements of the school which issues the test so it may be both written and spoken, but it can also be only one of the options.

The oral part of the &quot;maturita&quot; exam takes part in a classroom in which a commissioner must be present. The oral exam is divided into two 15 minute parts (except Czech language and literature, where the preparation time is 20 minutes), first a student draws a number of their question and then begins 15 minutes of preparation often called &quot;potítko&quot; (&quot;sweat lodge&quot;) after the first 15 minutes they are called in to the 15 minute oral exam. The commission is composed of the class teacher, commissioner and either a principal or a representative principal. The student is examined by the examiner and an assessor. The examiner and the assessor usually agree on a grade which should be assigned to the student and if not the commission takes a vote for the grade. Students can graduate with a grade better than 5 (grades are 1–5, where 1 is the best).

Exam duration, for both oral and written exams, as well as preparation time, can be longer for students with disabilities.

If students fail in one subject, they have the option to repeat the subject, if they fail more than one subject, then they have to repeat the complete set of exams including the written part. All students have a maximum of three attempts to succeed in this exam, if they fail to succeed they end secondary school without the &quot;maturita&quot; and are unable to apply for college or university. They still have a chance to do maturita exam on another secondary school in the future, but this mostly means that they should finish study on that another school in full length, e.g. 4 years.

=== Hungary ===
The official term for the matura exam in Hungary is &quot;érettségi vizsga&quot; or simply &quot;érettségi&quot;. It is usually taken after 12 or 13 years of schooling, at the age of 17 to 19, but may also be taken at a later age. The exam of certain subjects like foreign languages and IT can be completed at an earlier age. Candidates who pass their final exams (school-leaving exams) receive a document that contains their grades and which enables them to go to a university.

Hungarian students have to take an exam from Hungarian literature and grammar (&quot;magyar nyelv és irodalom&quot;), Mathematics (&quot;matematika&quot;), History (&quot;történelem&quot;), one foreign language (&quot;idegen nyelv&quot;), and one more subject of the student&#x27;s choice that can be anything that the student had learned for at least 2 years in school. While these five subjects are mandatory for obtaining a degree, candidates may choose as many additional exam subjects as they wish. Students can choose between standard (&quot;közép&quot;) or higher (&quot;emelt&quot;) level for each subject. The exams do not necessarily have to be taken in Hungarian; at the candidate&#x27;s request, they can be taken in any language (with the exception of Hungarian literature and grammar for obvious reasons).

The Hungarian literature and grammar, History, the Sciences (e.g. biology) and foreign language exams are made up of a written and an oral part, while the standard-level Mathematics exam contains only a written part. (Should a candidate fail their standard-level Mathematics exam, they can have an oral exam in order to pass). The higher-level Mathematics exam consists of both a written and an oral part.

The grading scale of the &quot;érettségi&quot; is the same as the usual grading used in Hungarian schools but the percentages differ: excellent (5), good (4), medium (3), pass (2), and fail (1).
=== Italy ===
In Italy the examination is commonly called &quot;(esame di) maturità&quot; (&quot;maturity exam&quot;) or just &quot;esame di Stato&quot; (&quot;state exam&quot;), but the official name is &quot;esame di Stato conclusivo del corso di studio di istruzione secondaria superiore&quot; (&quot;Final state exam of the upper secondary cycle of studies&quot;). This is the final exam for secondary school, which students are normally required to pass in order to be admitted to colleges and universities.

In Italy, the maturità is informally regarded as a rite of passage from adolescence to adulthood, after which secondary school graduates get ready for higher education and/or a job.

Examination boards are composed of three internal teachers belonging to the student&#x27;s school, three external teachers and an external president of the board. Every year the Ministry of Education decides which subjects will be assigned to external teachers; these are different depending on the type of school.

The exam is divided into written and oral sections. The written section consists of three tests. The first one is Italian and is identical nationwide: students are required to write an essay, an article on a given topic, but they can also choose to analyse and comment on a text (usually a poem). The second test changes according to the type of school the student attended, so it can be on a wide variety of different subjects, such as pedagogy and psychology, mathematics, foreign language, Latin, and Ancient Greek. It is identical nationwide for schools of the same type. The subject is decided by the Ministry a few months before the exam: it is almost always the same for some types of school (for example Mathematics for &quot;liceo scientifico&quot;) and it is chosen among the &quot;written&quot; subjects for other schools (for example, it is chosen between Latin and Ancient Greek for &quot;liceo classico&quot; or one of the three different foreign languages studied, included English, in &quot;liceo linguistico&quot;). Finally, the third test is about a maximum of five selected subjects of the last year, and it is written by every single examining commission. The student does not know before which subjects are in the text. Starting the school year 2018–2019 the third test will be abolished leaving the first and the second written tests and the oral test. The interview section is to assess that the student has really reached a personal and intellectual maturity concerning the various subjects of his or her last school year; the examining commission is supposed to ask about every subject, but has got to make sure that the candidate is also able to discuss about a variety of themes explaining and justifying his or her opinion; also, in recent years has become customary for each student to prepare a short essay (&quot;tesina&quot;) on a free topic, intended to showcase the ability to cover different sides of the topic using extensively the notions and methods learnt in school.

The scoring has been changed various times since 1969:
*1969–1998: pass 36, maximum 60
*1999–2006: pass 60, maximum 100 (45 + 35 + 20)
*2007–2008: pass 60, maximum 100 cum laude (40 + 45 + 30)
*2009–2018: pass 60, maximum 100 cum laude (45 + 30 + 25)
*2019: pass 60, maximum 100 cum laude (40 + 20 + 40)

The score is calculated by adding up:
* Credits: up to 25 points from school grades; the top score is assigned to students who have an average above 9 out of 10. Starting the school year 2018–2019 up to 40 points.
* Written exam: the pass mark is of 30 points out of 45. The candidate sits 3 written tests. For each one the passing mark is 10 points out of 15. Starting the school year 2018–2019 up to 40 points. The candidate sits 2 written tests. For each one up to 20 points.
* Oral exam: the passing mark is 20 points out of 30. Starting the school year 2018–2019 up to 20 points.
* Bonus: an extra 5 points can be awarded to the candidate by the examining commission. In order to get this bonus, candidates must have received at least 15 credits and the sum of their oral and written exams must be at least 70.

The students who are able to reach 100 points without needing a bonus can be awarded the &quot;lode&quot; (&quot;cum laude&quot;) praise by the examination board.

=== Kosovo ===
In Kosovo, Testi i Maturës Shtetërore/Državni maturski ispit (the State Mature Exam) is mandatory for every high school student in order to get the high school certificate. Without passing the Matura Exam, one cannot apply to any university within Kosovo. It has different number of questions per subject, depending on the High School&#x27;s profile.

It is held every year in June, and with the latest reforms, there are two tests, on two different days:

* the First one has 100 questions, and has questions about general subjects;
* the Second one has 100 questions, and has professional subjects questions.

From 2020 to 2022, it has 100 questions (25 per subject) on Albanian, Mathematics, English and another self-chosen subject. This exam change was made due to Covid-19 and the students have higher requirements, since they have to obtain more than 40 points to pass.

The tests are held on the same day for every school, usually in the middle of June. There is also a similar test for the Primary School pupils as well, called Testi i Semi-Maturës Shtetërore/Državni malomaturski ispit (State Semi-Matura Exam) which has 100 questions, and is mandatory for every pupil who will continue to High School.
The Semi-Matura Exam has also changed in June 2022. It now has 200 points and it is held in two days, like the Matura Exam before.
* the first exam has 100 points and is based on Social Sciences:(Albanian, History, Geography, English)
* the second exam also has 100 points but it is based on nature sciences: (Mathematics, Informatics, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
The Tests are provided by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and are in Albanian, Serbian, Turkish and Bosniak, who make the ethnical groups of Kosovo.

=== North Macedonia ===
In North Macedonia the matura is obligatory for every high school student who is planning on going to college afterwards. It is called &quot;државна матура&quot; (&quot;state matura&quot;) or simply &quot;матура&quot; (&quot;matura&quot;). Every student who intends to pass the matura is required to complete four exams:
* Native language (either Macedonian, Albanian or Turkish): demonstrating knowledge of literature and grammar of the four-year high school studying, as well as essay writing.
* Mathematics/foreign language: students choose whether they will take mathematics (basic or advanced level) or a foreign language (typically English, German, French or Russian).
* two subjects by student&#x27;s choice (subjects available, beside the aforementioned ones, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, Sociology, Informatics, Latin, Art, Music, History, Philosophy, Business etc)
* a project task

=== Poland ===

In the Polish education system, the exam is officially called &quot;egzamin maturalny&quot;, but it is commonly known as &quot;matura&quot;. It is taken on completion of high school, in May (with additional dates in June, and retakes available in August). The exam is not compulsory, although Polish students must pass it in order to be able to apply for higher education courses in Poland and elsewhere.

A major reform of the exam (originally enacted in 1999, although its introduction was delayed) came into effect as from 2005. Under the old system (popularly called &quot;stara matura&quot;) candidates&#x27; performance was assessed solely by teachers from their own schools. In the new system &quot;(nowa matura)&quot; written work is assessed by independent examiners. This is considered to make the results more objective, and as a result Polish higher education institutions no longer run entrance exams (as they did under the old system), but base their admissions primarily on &quot;matura&quot; results.

As of 2015, every student taking the &quot;matura&quot; takes three compulsory exams at &quot;basic level&quot; &quot;(poziom podstawowy)&quot; in:
*Polish (including knowledge of Polish and European literature)
*A selected modern language (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish or Russian)
*Mathematics
as well as at least one subject at &quot;extended level&quot; &quot;(poziom rozszerzony)&quot;. These include the above as well as biology, chemistry, geography, social studies, history, history of art, history of music, information technology, physics and astronomy, Latin and Ancient History, philosophy, another modern language, languages of ethnic groups in Poland (Belarusian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian), Kashubian and Lemko.

Exams in Polish and other languages include both a written paper and an oral examination.

Results are currently expressed as percentages. To pass the &quot;matura&quot; it is necessary to score at least 30% in each of the three compulsory exams. The results of the additional exams do not affect whether a student passes, but are usually a factor when applying for higher education places. Since the year 2015 the results are expressed not only as percentages, but are also accompanied by percentiles on the Matura certificate. This aims to make comparisons between Matura scores from different years fairer.

The exams are conducted by the Central Examination Board &quot;(Centralna Komisja Egzaminacyjna; CKE)&quot;, assisted by a number of Regional Examination Boards &quot;(Okręgowa Komisja Egzaminacyjna; OKE)&quot;. The same bodies also conduct tests for pupils completing primary school.

A custom associated with the &quot;matura&quot; is the &quot;studniówka&quot;, a ball organized for students and their teachers approximately one hundred days before the examinations begin. Following a popular superstition, candidates (particularly female ones) wear red underwear at the ball, and then wear the same items for the exam itself, to bring luck.

=== Serbia ===
Matura () is an obligatory exam at the end of primary school and high school. The exam taken at the end of primary school is called (Minor) while the one at the end of high school is called (Major).

For there are three exams:

* Serbian language
* Mathematics
* and a special test that has either biology, geography, history, chemistry or physics based on student&#x27;s choice.

For (Major) exams depend on the type of school where the student is taking the exam. In gymnasiums these three exams are taken:

* Serbian language
* Mathematics or English language
* And a third exam where students can choose to write a dissertation about a subject from the following courses: physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, philosophy, psychology, sociology, informatics, musicology or art.

In technical or medical schools these exams are taken:

* Serbian language
* Mathematics
* Depending on the school, a technician-type exam or a medicine-related exam
In Serbian maturas, usually only the dissertation portion of the exam is letter-graded while the rest are point-graded. After passing their exams, students can attempt to enroll at high schools or colleges and other higher-education institutions of their choice. The rankings which determine which students will be accepted to a certain high school are formed based on Matura exam points and GPA of final grades of each year in certain or all subjects. For colleges and other higher-education institutions, admission exams are also taken into account. The mandatory college admission exam accounts for 60% of a student&#x27;s ranking points while Matura exam points and the grade point average in all high school subjects account for 40%.

=== Slovakia ===
In Slovakia the matura is formally called &quot;Maturitná skúška&quot;. It consists of one to three distinct parts, depending on the subject. The first section is the External Section and is not required by all subjects. The second section is the Internal Section, it may have one or two subsections, the first one is the written subsection, which is not required by all subjects, and the second one is the verbal subsection, which is required by all subjects. All the sections of matura take place either in the &quot;proper&quot; term, which ranges from March to June, or in an &quot;extraordinary&quot; term, which may be from April to May, or September, or February of the next year.

The first part consists of the External Section. The subjects that include it are: the first foreign language (English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, and Italian), mathematics, Slovak language and literature, Slovak language and Slovak literature, Hungarian language and literature, and Ukrainian language and literature. This section is usually held in March. This section consists of a multiple choice and short answer test. The tests are prepared and electronically assessed by NÚCEM (National Institute for Certified Educational Measurements). The test for the External Section of a given subject has a start time that is the same for the whole of Slovakia and students are supervised by external employees (not employees of the school the test is taking place).

The second part consists of the written subsection of the Internal Section. The subjects which include the written subsection are: Slovak language and literature, Slovak language and Slovak literature, Hungarian language and literature, and Ukrainian language and literature. This subsection consists of one &quot;long answer&quot; question, where a student either receives a theme, or four themes from which they pick one, and then they write an essay in the corresponding language. The length of the essay is based on the proficiency CEFR level of the student. B1 – 160 – 180 words, B2 – 200 – 220 words, C1 – 260 – 320 words, native language (usually Slovak) – 1.5 – 3 A4 pages. The essay themes of a given subject have a start time that is the same for the whole of Slovakia and students are supervised by external employees (not employees of the school the test is taking place). Afterwards essays are evalued by each school according to central criteria.

The third part consists of the verbal subsection of the Internal Section. All subjects include this part. It is usually held in May. Schools create, supervise, and evaluate this part internally. Each subject has its maturita commission, which will create 25 assignments, which each have 3 questions. Afterwards, the school&#x27;s principal will approve these based on recommendations from the commission&#x27;s chairman. Students must bring a government issued ID card to prove their identity.

When taking part in matura, students choose or are assigned a proficiency level for their foreign language of choice depending on the school type and student skill. Students of gymnasium schools have to choose at least one foreign language at level B2. Students of linguist-specialized (bilingual) gymnasium schools and students in bilingual classes are assigned the C1 level for the foreign language they are focused on. In the past, if the student had gotten an additional certificate from foreign language (IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, FCE), at least at level B1, they did not need to pass the foreign language exam. However, this was changed in 2014, and now all secondary education students are required to pass the foreign language exam as a part of their matura.

Required subjects for each student depend on the type of school they attend. Usually 4 subjects are required depending on the native language of the student. For gymnasiums, these are: native language (usually Slovak) and literature, a foreign language, and 2 subjects chosen by the student, if the student is a part of an official national minority, in addition to their native language, they are required to choose either Slovak language and literature, or Slovak language and Slovak literature instead of 1 of the 2 choosable subjects. For the first choosable subject, the student must have a cumulative minimum of 6 weekly classes of that subject, or one that falls under the same category (for example, a student may have had 2 classes of math each week for 4 years, this would give them a cumulative total of 8 math classes). Students of bilingual gymnasium schools may have to choose up to 5 additional subjects instead of the regular 2. For schools with a dual education system (stredné odborné školy), these are: native language (usually Slovak) and literature, a foreign language, theoretical part of the subject the school is focused on, and a practical part of the subject the school is focused on, if the student is a part of an official national minority, they are required to choose either Slovak language and literature, or Slovak language and Slovak in addition to the other subjects. Some dual education system schools may offer a &quot;postmatura education&quot;, in which case, the student has already completed matura in the past, and therefore, their only subjects for matura are the theoretical part of the subject the school is focused on, and the practical part of the subject the school is focused on. A student may choose to take part in any number of subjects in addition to the ones they are required to choose.

If a student fails, does not show up without an accepted excuse, does &quot;unacceptable behaviour&quot; (cheating or exhibiting improper behaviour) during the external exam, or refuses to answer one of the questions in the vocal part, one of the required subjects, they are able to redo the matura in one of the extraordinary terms (unless unacceptable behaviour), or try again in the next year&#x27;s term. If a student fails, does not show up, or refuses to answer one of the questions in the vocal part of one of their extra subjects, that subject is not included in their final report, if however, they receive a passing, but unfavourable result from one of their extra subjects, they are not able to exclude it from their final report.

=== Slovenia ===
In Slovenia, the &quot;splošna matura&quot; (a general, university-oriented leaving exam) is an obligatory examination completed at the end of &quot;gimnazija&quot; (upper secondary school) in order to have one&#x27;s education formally recognised and to become eligible to enroll in colleges and universities. It ought not be confused with the &quot;poklicna matura&quot; (a vocational leaving exam), which is an obligatory examination completed at the end of vocational school programmes and which is not used to demonstrate one&#x27;s eligibility for university studies. Since there are no entrance examinations for the vast majority of Slovenian university programmes (notable exceptions include art, music and architecture), the score on this exam serves as the main criterion for admission (grades achieved during secondary school also play a small part).

It consists of three compulsory and two elective subjects, although three elective subjects may exceptionally be taken. Among the compulsory subjects, one must be a first or national language (usually Slovene, but, in areas with recognised minorities, alternatively Italian or Hungarian), one Mathematics and one a second or international modern language (selected among English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Russian). The elective subjects may be chosen among all of the remaining subjects one has encountered over the course of one&#x27;s secondary school education (including whichever modern languages one has not already chosen, the ancient languages Greek and Latin, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, history, history of art, theory of art, music, philosophy, psychology, sociology, economics, informatics, biotechnology, electrotechnics, mechanics and others, with some limitiations upon which subjects may be taken concurrently if one is taking two electives and none if one is exceptionally taking three).

The leaving exam is a centralised affair, conducted by the National Examination Centre which is in charge of setting assignments, appointing national examiners, grading examination sheets and disclosing the scores to all of the universities candidates have applied to within Slovenia.

The assessment is somewhat complicated, as there exist different criteria for marking different sets of subjects (largely depending on whether they are taken at an advanced or else standard level, with some subjects only being available at one). In general:

*Among the subjects, the first language is unique and is always graded on an advanced scale from 1 to 8 (with 1 the lowest and 8 the highest score).
*All of the other compulsory subjects, whether taken as compulsory or elective, may be taken at either an advanced or else standard level. If at an advanced level, they are graded on an advanced scale from 1 to 8, while if at a standard level, they are graded on a standard scale from 1 to 5.
*All of the other elective subjects are graded on a standard scale from 1 to 5.

The only score which indicates a failure to pass the examination is 1; all of the other scores are passes of different degrees (with 2 deemed &#x27;satisfactory&#x27;, and either 8 or else 5 deemed &#x27;excellent&#x27; at different scales).

It is, however, possible to pass the examination with a score of 1 in one subject if two conditions are met:
*The candidate has achieved at least 80% of the points required for a score of 2 on a scale from 1 to 5 in the subject, and
*The candidate has received at least a score of 2 in all other subjects, where
**In at least two subjects, the candidate has been awarded a score of 3 or higher (if the subject passed with a score of 1 is a compulsory subject), or
**In at least one subject, the candidate has been awarded a score of 3 or higher (if the subject passed with a score of 1 is an elective subject).

Thus, it is possible to gain up to 34 points across five subjects on the examination. If a candidate has taken five subjects, as is usually the case, all of them are accounted for in this final score. However, if a candidate has exceptionally taken six subjects, the sixth subject may be used to determine a final score in place of the lowest-scored among the first five subjects; in this case, all subjects are still accounted for on the candidate&#x27;s transcript, but one is excluded from the determination of the final score. Students who have achieved 30 or more points are awarded leaving exam diplomas cum laude (or, in Slovene, are recognised as having achieved a &quot;zlata matura&quot; or &#x27;golden leaving exam&#x27;) and are usually commended by the president of Slovenia at a festive reception held in September.

The structure of particular examinations is as follows:
* &quot;First Language – Slovene (or Hungarian or Italian for members of minorities)&quot;
** Sheet 1: Students write an essay (650 words) on the two pieces of literature. The national committee for Slovene (&quot;Državna predmetna komisija za splošno maturo za slovenščino&quot;) publishes the titles of the two works the examinees are expected to know one year ahead. This sheet represents 50% of the final score.
** Sheet 2: Students are given an unknown text from a newspaper, magazine etc., followed by some 30 tasks, testing their ability to read, interpret, and understand the text. Also, students&#x27; knowledge of Slovene grammar, word-formation and spelling is tested. The last task is to form a certain type of text, being an invitation, a letter of complaint, biography etc. This sheet represents 30% of the final mark.
** Oral exam: A candidate is given three questions. The first two are related to the world literature, whereas the third asks about Slovene grammar and history of literature. It is possible to gain 20%.

The final score is expressed in points from 1 (failure) to 8 (the highest standard of knowledge).
*Mathematics
It is possible to take this subject on a higher or basic level.
** Sheet 1: Students are given approximately ten tasks, evaluating their knowledge of different fields in mathematics. This sheet accounts for 53.3% (on a higher level) or 80% (on a basic level).
** Sheet 2 (only on a higher level): Students are given three more difficult tasks. This sheet is worth 26.7%.
** Oral exam: An examinee is given three questions, testing their ability to prove certain theorems or explain some mathematical axioms and definitions.

The final score is expressed in points from 1 (failure) to 5 (the highest mark on a basic level) or 8 (the highest mark on a higher level).
*Foreign languages
*Chemistry
*Information technology, Computer science (separate)
*Physics
*Geography
*History
*Sociology, Philosophy, Psychology

The nationwide leaving exam was reintroduced in Slovenia in 1994, after all upper secondary schools had been suspended in the 1980s and reopened in 1991. The exam is conducted in two terms, the first one being in spring (May/June) and the second one in autumn (September). Due to the university admittance procedure, of which the first call concludes in July, applicants passing the exam in September have usually a very limited choice of university programmes for that year.

There has been a heated debate lately whether this leaving exam should once again be completely abolished. As of January 2007, the position of the Ministry of Education remains that the &quot;matura&quot; will still be the only way of completing secondary education. The decision on whether universities should introduce entrance examinations and reduce the importance of the leaving exam to a mere pass/fail has not been made yet.

=== Switzerland ===

==== Gymnasiale Matura, Maturité gymnasiale, Maturità liceale ====
In Switzerland&#x27;s education system, secondary school has several tiers oriented towards different professional tracks. The gymnasium, leading to the Matura graduation, is the highest tier, offering broad and thorough academic foundations to prepare its students for direct entry to university. Approximately 20% of youth attain the Matura every year, although this figure varies among the different cantons, which are in charge of (upper) secondary education. The gymnasial Matura is required and sufficient (except for medicine, where the number of students is restricted) for Swiss students to study at a university or a federal institute of technology irrespective of their subject choice.

The specific requirements for a Matura graduation vary slightly among the cantons. In general they involve two parts: The grades of the last school year and standardized Matura exams at the end of 12th or 13th grade, depending on the canton. Also a scientific Matura paper of about 25 pages has to be executed. Grades attained in classes during the last school year and at the exams, as well as the Matura paper contribute equally to the final grade. With a revision in 2007, among others an appreciation of science subjects were carried out by individual graduation of biology, physics and chemistry, increasing the proportion of teaching mathematics and natural science subjects as well as the introduction of computer science as a supplementary subject.

6 is the best grade, 1 is the lowest. The required average grade to attain Matura is 4. In order to pass, all grades below 4 have to be compensated by better grades in double, and no more than four grades lower than 4 are allowed.

The cantons are responsible for the organisation of the final tests. Exams include a series of oral and written tests. Tests are typically administered by a team consisting of a teacher who was involved in the student&#x27;s classes and an independent expert. This cantonal Matura exam is recognised in the whole country but there is no single standardised test on a national level in contrary to what exists in France, for instance where the same test with the same questions and the same themes is passed by all students on the same day.

The gymnasial Matura subjects by federal ordinance (&quot;MAV/ORM&quot;, &quot;SR 413.11&quot;) are (&quot;Art. 9&quot;):

The Matura consists of:
# all 10 or 11 (depends on the canton) basic subjects
# one major subject
# one additional subject
# Matura paper, evaluated by work process, written paper, and oral presentation
* Basic subjects are:
# a &quot;first national language&quot;, such as French, German, Italian, or Romansh (only in canton of Grisons); including its related literature
# a &quot;second national language&quot;
# a &quot;third language&quot;: either a third national language, or English, or a classical language, either Latin or Ancient Greek
# Mathematics
# Biology
# Chemistry
# Physics
# History
# Geography
# Visual Arts or Music
# &quot;Cantons (such as Lucerne) may voluntarily provide an additional basic subject:&quot; Philosophy
* The major subject is selected from:
** &quot;Classic languages&quot; (Latin and/or Ancient Greek)
** A &quot;modern language&quot; (a third national language, English, Spanish, or Russian)
** Physics and Applied Mathematics
** Biology and Chemistry
** Economics and Law
** Philosophy, Education, Psychology
** Visual Arts
** Music
* The additional subject is selected from (must not be equal to major subject):
** Physics
** Chemistry
** Biology
** Applied Mathematics
** Informatics (Computer Science)
** History
** Geography
** Philosophy
** Religion
** Economics and Law
** Education/Psychology
** Visual Arts (excluded, if major subject is either Visual Arts or Music)
** Music (excluded, if major subject is either Visual Arts or Music)
** Sports (excluded, if major subject is either Visual Arts or Music)

The distribution of teaching hours among the subjects must adhere to the following scheme:
* For basic subjects:
** Languages (first, second, and third): 30–40%
** Mathematics and Natural Sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology): 25–35%
** Human and Social Sciences (History, Geography, Introduction in Economics and Law, possibly also Philosophy): 10–20%
** Arts (Visual Arts and/or Music): 5–10%
* For major and additional subjects, and Matura paper: 15–25%

Matura exams are executed on at least five of the following subjects (all written exams and optionally also oral):
# The first language
# A second national (or cantonal) Language
# Mathematics
# the major subject
# &quot;another subject chosen by cantonal preferences&quot;

A &quot;Federal Matura&quot; exists on a national level, though each &quot;Cantonal Matura&quot; is also inherently approved on a federal level. The Federal Matura is organised by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) twice a year in each linguistical region.

An additional exam called &quot;Latinum Helveticum&quot;, also organised by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, allows the student to study a field at a university that requires Latin knowledges.

==== Fachmatura / Maturité de culture générale / Maturità specializzata / Maturita media spezialisada ====
The Fachmatura/Maturité de culture générale/Maturità specializzata/Maturita media spezialisada is a relatively new program (success rates were first published in 2008). The exam is taken after completion of a Fachmittelschule and it opens up certain technical college courses. The program requires successful completion of general education subjects as well as one year of additional training in one or two professional fields and writing a matura paper. The following fields may be chosen from; health, social work, science, communication and information, music/dance/theater, art and design and education.

==== Berufsmatura / Maturité professionelle / Maturità professionale ====
The advanced vocational certificate (Berufsmatura/Maturité professionelle/Maturità professionale) allows access to the Fachhochschule or University of Applied Sciences and indicated both successful completion of the vocational program as well as additional advanced studies. It can be earned either during the vocation course or after course completion. Originally there were six specialties in which the certificate could be earned. Following the new vocational regulations of May 2015 there are now five orientations with two variants for each of the first three; &quot;Technology, Architecture and Life Sciences&quot;, &quot;Economics and Services&quot;, &quot;Health and Welfare&quot;, &quot;Art and Design&quot;, and &quot;Nature, Agriculture and Food Services&quot;.

=== Ukrainian diaspora ===
Matura is common in Ukrainian secondary education in the Ukrainian diaspora, specifically in the United States and Canada. It is usually run by Saturday Ukrainian Education schools sponsored by the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, which regulates and writes the various tests. Children of Ukrainian descent are tested on Saturdays during a month-long period toward the end of their junior or senior year of high school on their knowledge of Ukrainian, geography, history, culture, and literature. Often, these tests are approved by local governments&#x27; accreditation standards as a second-language school which can, under certain circumstances, be applied to other schools.

<text>Virginia Elizabeth &quot;Geena&quot; Davis (born January 21, 1956) is an American actor. She is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.

Davis made her acting debut in the satirical romantic comedy &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982) and starred in the science-fiction thriller &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), one of her first box office hits. While the fantasy comedy &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) brought her to prominence, the romantic drama &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988) earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She established herself as a leading lady with the road film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and the sports film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992), garnering a Golden Globe Award nomination. However, Davis&#x27;s roles in the box office failures &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; (1996), both directed by then-husband Renny Harlin, were followed by a lengthy break and downturn in her career.

Davis starred as the adoptive mother of the title character in the &quot;Stuart Little&quot; franchise (1999–2005) and as the first female president of the United States in the television series &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; (2005–2006), winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her role in the latter. Her later films include &quot;Accidents Happen&quot; (2009) and &quot;Marjorie Prime&quot; (2017). She has portrayed the recurring role of Dr. Nicole Herman in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2014–2015, 2018) and that of Regan MacNeil/Angela Rance in the first season of the horror television series &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (2017).

In 2004, Davis launched the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which works collaboratively with the entertainment industry to increase the presence of female characters in media. Through the organization, she launched the annual Bentonville Film Festival in 2015, and executive produced the documentary &quot;This Changes Everything&quot; in 2018. Davis received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2019 and the Governors Award in 2022.

==Early life and education==
Geena Davis was born on January 21, 1956, in Wareham, Massachusetts. Her mother, Lucille (née Cook), was a teacher&#x27;s assistant, and her father, William F. Davis, was a civil engineer and church deacon. Both were from small towns in Vermont. Davis has an older brother, Danforth (&quot;Dan&quot;).

She became interested in music at an early age. She learned piano and flute and played organ well enough as a teenager to be organist at her Congregational church in Wareham. Davis was also a cheerleader and was cheer captain her senior year of high school. She attended Wareham High School and was an exchange student in Sandviken, Sweden, where she became fluent in Swedish and got engaged to classmate Mats Dahlsköld, with whom she still corresponds by letter. She wanted to study acting at Boston University but missed the required audition during her year in Sweden, so she began her college education at New England College before transferring to Boston University; she didn&#x27;t earn enough credits to graduate, having received an incomplete in at least one class and an F in movement class. Her first post-university work was as a model for window mannequins at Ann Taylor; she then signed with New York&#x27;s Zoli modeling agency.

In her 2022 memoir, she states that her brother came up with the nickname Geena shortly after her birth to differentiate her from her Aunt Virginia, who went by the nickname Ginny.

==Career==
===Rise to fame (1982–1987)===

Davis was working as a model when she was cast by director Sydney Pollack in his film &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982) as a soap opera actor, whom she has described as &quot;someone who&#x27;s going to be in their underwear a lot of time&quot;. It was the second most profitable film of 1982, received ten Academy Awards nominations and is considered a classic. She next won the regular part of Wendy Killian in the television series &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, which aired from June 1983 to March 1984; and had a writing credit in one episode. Despite the series&#x27; eleven Emmy Awards nominations, lukewarm ratings led to its cancellation after two seasons. Davis concurrently guest-starred in &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot; and &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, and followed with a series of her own, &quot;Sara&quot;, which lasted 13 episodes. 
During this period, she also auditioned for the 1984 science fiction/action film &quot;The Terminator&quot;, reading for the lead role of Sarah Connor, which eventually went to Linda Hamilton. In &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), an action comedy, she appeared with Chevy Chase as the colleague of a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; undercover reporter trying to expose drug trafficking on the beaches of Los Angeles. She also starred in the horror comedy &quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot; as a nymphomaniac vampire alongside future husband Jeff Goldblum. They also starred in the sci-fi thriller &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), loosely based on George Langelaan&#x27;s 1957 short story of the same name, where Davis portrayed a science journalist and an eccentric scientist&#x27;s love interest. It was a commercial success and helped establish her as an actor. In 1987 she appeared with Goldblum again in the offbeat comedy &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;.

===Recognition and praise (1988–1992)===

Director Tim Burton cast Davis in his horror comedy &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) as one of a recently deceased young couple who become ghosts haunting their former house; it also starred Alec Baldwin, Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder. It made $73.7 million from a budget of $15 million, and Davis&#x27;s performance and the overall film received mostly positive reviews.

Davis took on the role of an animal hospital employee and dog trainer with a sickly son in the romantic drama &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988), alongside William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. Critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film four stars out of four, wrote: &quot;Davis, as Muriel, brings an unforced wackiness to her role in scenes like the one where she belts out a song while she&#x27;s doing the dishes. But she is not as simple as she sometimes seems [...]&quot;. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success, and Davis&#x27; performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Davis appeared as the girlfriend of a man who, dressed as a clown, robs a bank in midtown Manhattan, in the comedy &quot;Quick Change&quot; (1990). Based on a book of the same name by Jay Cronley, it is a remake of the 1985 French film &quot;Hold-Up&quot; starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. Despite modest box office returns, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found the lead actors &quot;funny and creative while keeping their characters life-size&quot;. Davis next starred with Susan Sarandon in Ridley Scott&#x27;s road film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991), as friends who embark on a road trip with unforeseen consequences. A critical and commercial success, it is considered a classic, as it influenced other films and artistic works and became a landmark feminist film. Davis&#x27; performance in the film earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. It also featured Brad Pitt in his breakout role as a drifter; in his 2020 Oscar acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actor, Pitt thanked director Ridley Scott and Davis for &quot;giving me my first shot.&quot;

In 1992, Davis starred alongside Madonna and Tom Hanks in the sports comedy-drama &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; as a baseball player on an all-women&#x27;s team. It reached number one at the box office, became the tenth highest-grossing film of the year in North America, and earned Davis her first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. She played a television reporter in the comedy &quot;Hero&quot; (also 1992) alongside Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia. Although it flopped at the box office, Roger Ebert felt Davis was &quot;bright and convincing as the reporter (her best line, after surviving the plane crash, is shouted through an ambulance door: &quot;This is my story! I did the research!&quot;)&quot;.

===Downturn, hiatus and television roles (1993–2009)===
In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Angie&quot;, Davis played an office worker who lives in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and dreams of a better life. The film received mixed reviews from critics, despite much praise for Davis, and was a commercial failure. In her other 1994 release, the romantic comedy &quot;Speechless&quot;, Davis reunited with Michael Keaton to play insomniac writers who fall in love until they realize that both are writing speeches for rival candidates in a New Mexico election. Despite negative reviews and modest box office returns, she earned her second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her performance.
Davis teamed up with her then-husband, director Renny Harlin, for the films &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; (1996), with Harlin hoping that they would turn her into an action star. While &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; managed to become a moderate success, &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; flopped critically and commercially and was once listed as having the &quot;largest box office loss&quot; by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The film is credited to be a contributing factor in the demise of Davis as a bankable star. By the mid and late 1990s, Davis&#x27;s film career had become less noteworthy as she divorced Harlin in 1998 and took an &quot;unusually long&quot; two years off to reflect on her career, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, she recalled: &quot;Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40s. If you look at IMDb, up until that age, I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40s, I made one movie, &quot;Stuart Little&quot;. I was getting offers, but for nothing meaty or interesting like in my 30s. I&#x27;d been completely ruined and spoiled. I mean, I got to play a pirate captain! I got to do every type of role, even if the movie failed.&quot; She appeared as Eleanor Little in the well-received family comedy &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999), a role she reprised in &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002) and again in &quot;Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild&quot; (2005).

Davis starred in the sitcom &quot;The Geena Davis Show&quot;, which aired for one season on ABC during the 2000–01 U.S. television season. She went on to star in the ABC television series &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, portraying the first female president of the United States. While this role garnered her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series in 2006, the series was cancelled after its first season; Davis admitted she was &quot;devastated&quot; by its cancellation in a 2016 interview. &quot;I still haven&#x27;t gotten over it. I really wanted it to work. It was on Tuesday nights opposite &quot;House&quot;, which wasn&#x27;t ideal. But we were the best new show that fall. Then, in January, we were opposite &quot;American Idol&quot;. They said, &#x27;The ratings are going to suffer, so we should take you off the air for the entire run of &quot;Idol&quot;, and bring it back in May. I put a lot of time and effort into getting it on another network, too, but it didn&#x27;t work&quot;. Her performance in the series earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama, in addition to nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series. She was awarded the 2006 Women in Film Lucy Award.

Davis was the only American actor to be cast in the Australian-produced film &quot;Accidents Happen&quot; (2009), portraying a foul-mouthed and strict mother. She stated that it was the most fun she had ever had on a film set, and felt a deep friendship and connection to both of the actors who played her sons. Written by Brian Carbee and based on his own childhood and adolescence, the film received a limited theatrical release and mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Variety&quot; found it to be &quot;led by a valiant Geena Davis&quot;, despite a &quot;script that mistakes abuse for wit&quot;.

===Professional expansion (2010–present)===
Following a long period of intermittent work, Davis often ventured into television acting, and through her organization, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, saw her career expand during the 2010s. In 2012, she starred as a psychiatrist in the miniseries &quot;Coma&quot;, based on the 1977 novel &quot;Coma&quot; by Robin Cook and the subsequent 1978 film. She played a powerful female movie executive in the comedy &quot;In a World...&quot; (2013), the directorial debut of Lake Bell. Bell found her only dialogue to be her favorite in the film and called it her &quot;soapbox moment&quot;.

In 2014, Davis provided her voice for the English version of the Studio Ghibli animated film &quot;When Marnie Was There&quot;, as she was drawn to the film&#x27;s abundant stories and strong use of female characters. She played the recurring role of Dr. Nicole Herman, an attending fetal surgeon with a life-threatening brain tumor, during the 11th season of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2014–2015). In 2015, Davis launched an annual film festival to be held in Bentonville, Arkansas, to highlight diversity in film, accepting films that prominently feature minorities and women in the cast and crew. The first Bentonville Film Festival took place from May 5–9, 2015. Davis appeared as the mother of a semi-famous television star in the comedy &quot;Me Him Her&quot; (2016).

In the television series &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (2016), based on the 1973 film of the same name, Davis took on the role of grown-up Regan MacNeil, who has renamed herself Angela Rance to find peace and anonymity from her ordeal as a child. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was a success with critics and audiences. In 2017, Davis starred in the film adaptation &quot;Marjorie Prime&quot;, alongside Jon Hamm, playing the daughter of an 85-year old experiencing the first symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and appeared as the imaginary god of a heavyset 13-year-old girl in the comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Irene&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that she stole &quot;every scene&quot; in &quot;Marjorie Prime&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot;, on her role in &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Irene&quot;, remarked: &quot;There&#x27;s no arguing the preternatural coolness of Geena Davis, a fact celebrated in self-conscious fashion by &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Irene&quot;, a familiar type of coming-of-age film whose most distinguishing feature is the presence of the actress&quot;.

In 2018, Davis returned to &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, reprising the role of Dr. Nicole Herman in the show&#x27;s 14th season, and executive produced the documentary &quot;This Changes Everything&quot;, in which she was also interviewed about her experiences in the industry. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was named first runner-up for the People&#x27;s Choice Award: Documentaries. In 2019, she joined the voice cast of &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot; as Huntara, and executive produced CBS educational show &quot;Mission Unstoppable&quot; through her organization. The same year, she joined the cast of &quot;GLOW&quot; as Sandy Devereaux St. Clair, a former showgirl turned entertainment director of the Fan-Tan Hotel and Casino. In 2022, Davis&#x27; likeness was used for the character of Poison Ivy in the DC Entertainment comic book series &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, set between the events of &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023). Davis has been a frequent guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional, appearing at Disneyland in 2015 and Disney World in 2011, 2012, and 2019.

In October 2022, HarperOne published Davis&#x27;s &quot;Dying of Politeness: A Memoir&quot; of her journey from childhood conventional New England femininity and trauma to feminist &quot;badassery&quot;, one role at a time, on screen and in the real world.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and family===

Davis began dating restaurateur Richard Emmolo in December 1978 and moved in with him a month later. The two married on March 25, 1981, but separated in February 1983 and divorced on June 27, 1984. She then dated future &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; co-star Christopher McDonald, to whom she was briefly engaged.

In 1985, she met her second husband, actor Jeff Goldblum, on the set of &quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot;. The couple married on November 1, 1987, and appeared together in two more films: &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;. Davis filed for divorce in October 1990, and it was finalized the following year. In 2022, Davis told &quot;People&quot; that her relationship with him &quot;was a magical chapter in my life&quot; and that she liked being wed to a fellow actor because he understood what she was going through and &quot;was not in competition&quot; with her.

Security expert Gavin de Becker was Davis&#x27; boyfriend during the early 1990s. She also had a liaison with Brad Pitt around that time. After a five-month courtship, she married filmmaker Renny Harlin on September 18, 1993. He directed her in &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; and &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;. Davis filed for divorce on August 26, 1997, a day after her personal assistant Tiffany Bowne gave birth to a son fathered by Harlin. The divorce became final in June 1998.

In 1998, Davis started dating Iranian-American craniofacial plastic surgeon Reza Jarrahy, and allegedly married him on September 1, 2001. They have three children: daughter Alizeh (born April 10, 2002) and fraternal twin sons Kaiis and Kian (born May 6, 2004). In May 2018, Jarrahy filed for divorce from Davis, listing their date of separation as November 15, 2017. Davis responded by filing a petition in which she claimed that she and Jarrahy were never legally married. Their divorce became final in December 2021. They agreed to change the last names of their two sons from &quot;Davis-Jarrahy&quot; to &quot;Jarrahy&quot;.

===Activism===

Davis is a supporter of the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation and an advocate for Title IX, an Act of Congress focusing on equality in sports opportunities, now expanded to prohibit gender discrimination in American educational institutions.

In 2004, while watching children&#x27;s television programs and videos with her daughter, Davis noticed an imbalance in the ratio of male to female characters. She went on to sponsor the largest-ever research project on gender in children&#x27;s entertainment (resulting in four discrete studies, including one on children&#x27;s television) at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. The study, directed by Stacy Smith, showed that there were nearly three male characters to every female one in the nearly 400 G, PG, PG-13, and R-rated movies analyzed. In 2005, Davis teamed up with the non-profit group &quot;Dads and Daughters&quot; to launch a venture dedicated to balancing the number of male and female characters in children&#x27;s television and movie programming.

Davis launched the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media in 2004, which works collaboratively with the entertainment industry to increase the presence of female characters in media aimed at children, and to reduce inequality in Hollywood and the stereotyping of females by the male-dominated industry. For her work in this field she received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Bates College in May 2009; and an honorary Oscar, the Academy&#x27;s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, in 2019.

In 2011, Davis became one of a handful of celebrities attached to USAID and Ad Council&#x27;s FWD campaign, an awareness initiative tied to that year&#x27;s East Africa drought. She joined Uma Thurman, Chanel Iman and Josh Hartnett in television and internet ads to &quot;forward the facts&quot; about the crisis.

===Athletics===
In July 1999, Davis was one of 300 women who vied for a semifinals berth in the U.S. Olympic archery team to participate in the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. She placed 24th and did not qualify for the team, but participated as a wild-card entry in the Sydney International Golden Arrow competition. In August 1999, she stated that she was not an athlete growing up and that she entered archery in 1997, two years before her tryouts.

<text>Zebulon Montgomery Pike (January 5, 1779 – April 27, 1813) was an American brigadier general and explorer for whom Pikes Peak in Colorado is named. As a U.S. Army officer he led two expeditions through the Louisiana Purchase territory, first in 1805–1806 to reconnoiter the upper northern reaches of the Mississippi River, and then in 1806–1807 to explore the southwest to the fringes of the northern Spanish-colonial settlements of New Mexico and Texas. Pike&#x27;s expeditions coincided with other Jeffersonian expeditions, including the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the Red River Expedition in 1806.

Pike&#x27;s second expedition crossed the Rocky Mountains into what is now southern Colorado, which led to his capture by the Spanish colonial authorities near Santa Fe, who sent Pike and his men to Chihuahua (present-day Mexico) for interrogation. Later in 1807, Pike and some of his men were escorted by the Spanish through Texas and released near American territory in Louisiana.

In 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, a book so popular that it was translated into several languages for publication in Europe. He later achieved the rank of brigadier general in the American Army and served during the War of 1812 until he was killed during the Battle of York in April 1813, outside the British colonial capital of Upper Canada.

==Early and family life==

===Early life and education===
Pike was born on January 5, 1779, in Lamington, New Jersey. He was the son of Isabella (Brown) and Zebulon Pike, and followed in the footsteps of his father, who had begun his own career in the military service of the United States in 1775 at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. Through his father, he was a direct descendant of Robert Pike, who was famous being an opponent of the Salem witchcraft prosecutions of 1692.

Zebulon Pike Jr. grew to adulthood with his family at a series of outposts in Ohio and Illinois—the United States&#x27; northwestern frontier at the time. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry in 1799 and promoted to first lieutenant later that same year.

===Marriage and family===
Pike married his cousin Clarissa Harlow Brown in 1801. They had one child who survived to adulthood, Clarissa Brown Pike, who later married President William Henry Harrison&#x27;s son, John Cleves Symmes Harrison. They had four other children who died before reaching adulthood. He was the great-granduncle of Medal of Honor recipient Emory Jenison Pike. 

==Military career==
Pike&#x27;s military career included working on logistics and payroll at a series of frontier posts, including Fort Belle Fontaine near today&#x27;s St. Louis. General-in-Chief James Wilkinson (1757-1825), of the United States Army was appointed by third President Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826, served 1801-1809), as first Governor of the Upper Louisiana Territory and headquartered there, becaming young Pike&#x27;s mentor.

In 1796, Pike shadowed the expedition of General Georges Henri Victor Collot (1750-1805), a Royal, then Imperial French Army officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize the lightly settled heartland territory of the Mississippi River valley basin from the nascent United States further to the East.

===First expedition===
In the summer of 1805, General-in-Chief James Wilkinson ordered young Lt. Pike to locate the northern source of the Mississippi River, explore the northern portion of the newly created and beginning to organize the Louisiana Territory, and expel any British / Canadian roving fur traders illegally trading within the new western borders of the expanded United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by pirogue. He and his crew reached the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers on September 21, where he negotiated a Treaty of St. Peters agreement with the native Dakota Indians, purchasing the future site of Fort Snelling. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day Little Falls, Minnesota, on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the frozen river on foot, visiting several British North West Company fur posts along the way.

They reached the fur post at Leech Lake on February 1 and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the new boundaries of the United States and henceforth required to abide by its American laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent Ojibwe chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British and offering American peace medals. He also relayed the new United States&#x27; desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference back in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several hundred miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the British red ensign flag from the fur company&#x27;s flag pole, replacing it with a fifteen stars and fifteen stripes Star-Spangled Banner American flag. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on Upper Red Cedar Lake (later renamed Cass Lake), designating the lake as the upper source of the Mississippi and taking celestial observations / calculations to determine its latitude.

Pike and his men left Leech Lake on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike&#x27;s was the second expedition besides earlier Lewis and Clark, dispatched by the U.S. government into its new western territories, and the first to return.

===Second expedition===

After Lieutenant Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to the Southwest to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the Arkansas River and parallel Red River of the South upstream from the lower Mississippi River. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the new Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans. It is commonly said that his expedition was an innocent exploration of the West, but that is not the case. This was a mission to prepare for a possible American invasion of the neighboring Royal Spanish provinces of New Mexico and Texas over the disputed southwest border from France&#x27;s sale of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Beginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the &quot;Pike Expedition&quot;.

In early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him (Pikes Peak). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.

They then continued south, searching for the Red River of the South&#x27;s headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. Royal Spanish authorities captured Pike and some of his party on February 26, 1807.

Pike and his men were taken to the old colonial capital of Santa Fe of the Royal Spanish province of New Mexico and on further south to the Chihuahua City capital of Chihuahua province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state. Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting diplomatic dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike&#x27;s confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both their democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.

During this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and New Spain, and especially learned about colonial Mexico&#x27;s increasing discontentment with Royal Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike&#x27;s exploring expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and the Kingdom of Spain was rebelling against Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s younger brother, who was put in place to rule Spain and was also fighting Great Britain in the Peninsular War), Commandant Salcedo released the American military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men back north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807.

===War of 1812===
Pike was promoted to the rank of captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Pike fought with the 4th Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Tippecanoe under General (and future ninth President) William Henry Harrison (1773-1841). He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike&#x27;s military career also included service as deputy quartermaster-general in New Orleans and inspector general during the later part of the War of 1812 (1812-1815).

Pike commanded the advance guard of an American force which was defeated—primarily because of the poor planning and half-hearted effort of his commander, Henry Dearborn—at the first Battle of Lacolle Mills in November 1812. Pike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813. Along with General Jacob Brown, Pike departed from the newly fortified rural military outpost of Sackets Harbor, on the New York shore of Lake Ontario, for what became his last military campaign. On this expedition, Pike commanded combat troops in the successful attack on York (now Toronto) on April 27, 1813. Pike was killed, along with numerous other American troops, by flying rocks and other debris when the withdrawing British garrison blew up its ammunition magazine as Pike&#x27;s troops approached Fort York. His body was brought by ship back to Sackets Harbor, where his remains were buried at the military cemetery.

==Confiscated Papers==
The Spanish authorities confiscated some of Pike&#x27;s papers, which were not recovered by the United States from Mexico until the 20th century. Pike wrote an account of his expeditions, some of which had to be recreated from memory, which was published in 1810 as &quot;The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to Headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the Years 1805–6–7&quot;. These journals and maps gave Americans important information about trade opportunities along with the blueprints for the Santa Fe Trail. It was popular and was later translated into Dutch, French, and German editions. It became popular reading for all American explorers who followed him in the 19th century.

Pike&#x27;s capture by the Spanish and travel through the Southwest gave Pike insight into the region. For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the Mexican independence movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua.

In some eastern regions of North America, a tradition or legend pervades often referred to as &quot;The Lost City of Palanor&quot; or &quot;Zebulon&#x27;s Gift&quot; which has been attributed to Pike&#x27;s journals. The myth, said to be derived from a missing portion of Pike&#x27;s confiscated journals, is usually told in two segments. The first sequence involves Pike&#x27;s unlikely acquisition of a great treasure. The second is a description of Pike&#x27;s discovery of the lost city &quot;Palanor,&quot; said to be built by pre-Columbian European settlers, and his decision to hide the treasure there.

==Legacy==
As Michael Olsen shows, after Pike&#x27;s death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the Civil War but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition. His 20th-century reputation focused on his exploration, and his name appeared often on natural features, such as dams, islands, lakes, and parks. Pike&#x27;s Peak remains the second most visited mountain in the world. Pike&#x27;s expedition route of approximately 3,664 miles is maintained to this day by the Pike National Trail Association.

Pike was honored in 1901 by General William Jackson Palmer with a marble statue placed near the main entrance of the Antlers Hotel.  Pike was later honored in 1926 with a bronze medallion portrait placed in the pavilion at Tahama Spring (named after Pike&#x27;s Dakota guide, Chief Tahama) in Monument Valley Park, Colorado Springs. For over two hundred years, historians have debated whether Pike was truly an explorer, or if he was a spy.

<text>Aldo Leopold (January 11, 1887 – April 21, 1948) was an American writer, philosopher, naturalist, scientist, ecologist, forester, conservationist, and environmentalist. He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin and is best known for his book &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; (1949), which has been translated into fourteen languages and has sold more than two million copies.

Leopold was influential in the development of modern environmental ethics and in the movement for wilderness conservation. His ethics of nature and wildlife preservation had a profound impact on the environmental movement, with his ecocentric or holistic ethics regarding land. He emphasized biodiversity and ecology and was a founder of the science of wildlife management.

==Early life==
Rand Aldo Leopold was born in Burlington, Iowa, on January 11, 1887. His father, Carl Leopold, was a businessman who made walnut desks and was first cousin to his wife, Clara Starker. Charles Starker, father of Carl and uncle to Clara, was a German immigrant, educated in engineering and architecture. Rand Aldo was named after two of his father&#x27;s business partners—C. W. Rand and Aldo Sommers—although he eventually dropped the use of &quot;Rand&quot;. The Leopold family included younger siblings Mary Luize, Carl Starker, and Frederic. Leopold&#x27;s first language was German, although he mastered English at an early age.

Aldo Leopold&#x27;s early life was highlighted by the outdoors. Carl would take his children on excursions into the woods and taught his oldest son woodcraft and hunting. Aldo showed an aptitude for observation, spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home. Mary would later say of her older brother, &quot;He was very much an outdoorsman, even in his extreme youth. He was always out climbing around the bluffs, or going down to the river, or going across the river into the woods.&quot; He attended Prospect Hill Elementary, where he ranked at the top of his class, and then, the overcrowded Burlington High School. Every August, the family vacationed in Michigan on the forested Marquette Island in Lake Huron, which the children took to exploring.

==Schooling==
In 1900, Gifford Pinchot, who oversaw the newly implemented Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture, donated money to Yale University to begin one of the nation&#x27;s first forestry schools. Hearing of this development, the teenaged Leopold decided on forestry as a vocation. His parents agreed to let him attend The Lawrenceville School, a preparatory college in New Jersey, to improve his chances of admission to Yale. The Burlington High School principal wrote in a reference letter to the headmaster at Lawrenceville that Leopold was &quot;as earnest a boy as we have in school... painstaking in his work... Moral character above reproach.&quot; He arrived at his new school in January 1904, shortly before he turned 17. He was considered an attentive student, although he was again drawn to the outdoors. Lawrenceville was suitably rural, and Leopold spent much time mapping the area and studying its wildlife. Leopold studied at the Lawrenceville School for a year, during which time he was accepted to Yale. Because the Yale School of Forestry granted only graduate degrees, he first enrolled in Sheffield Scientific School&#x27;s preparatory forestry courses for his undergraduate studies, in New Haven, Connecticut. While Leopold was able to explore the woods and fields of Lawrenceville daily, sometimes to the detriment of his studying, at Yale he had little opportunity to do so; his studies and social life made his outdoor trips few and far between. Leopold graduated from the Yale Forestry School in 1909.

==Career==
In 1909, Leopold was assigned to the Forest Service&#x27;s District 3 in the Arizona and New Mexico territories. At first, he was a forest assistant at the Apache National Forest in the Arizona Territory. In 1911, he was transferred to the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico. Leopold&#x27;s career, which kept him in New Mexico until 1924, included developing the first comprehensive management plan for the Grand Canyon, writing the Forest Service&#x27;s first game and fish handbook, and proposing Gila Wilderness Area, the first national wilderness area in the Forest Service system.

On April 5, 1923, he was elected an associate member (now called &quot;professional member&quot;) of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell.

In 1924, he accepted transfer to the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, and became an associate director.

In 1933, he was appointed Professor of Game Management in the Agricultural Economics Department at the University of Wisconsin, the first such professorship of wildlife management. At the same time he was named Research Director of the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum. Leopold and other members of the first Arboretum Committee initiated a research agenda around re-establishing &quot;original Wisconsin&quot; landscape and plant communities, particularly those that predated European settlement, such as tallgrass prairie and oak savanna.

Under the Oberlaender Trust of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation, Leopold was part of the 1935 group of six U.S. Forest Service associates who toured the forests of Germany and Austria. Leopold was invited specifically to study game management, and this was his first and only time abroad. His European observations would have a significant impact on his ecological thinking, leading him to view the German policies in favor of blocks of monoculture trees in straight lines as a cautionary tale leading to soil degradation and an overall loss of biodiversity.

After 1935, Leopold was no longer working for the U.S. Forest Service; he had left the agency in 1928 to work independently and later became a professor at the University of Wisconsin.

==Personal life and death==
Leopold married Estella Bergere in northern New Mexico in 1912 and they had five children together. They lived in a modest two-story home close to the UW–Madison campus. His children followed in his footsteps as teachers and naturalists: Aldo Starker Leopold (1913–1983) was a wildlife biologist and professor at UC Berkeley; Luna B. Leopold (1915–2006) became a hydrologist and geology professor at UC Berkeley; Nina Leopold Bradley (1917–2011) was a researcher and naturalist; Aldo Carl Leopold (1919–2009) was a plant physiologist, who taught at Purdue University for 25 years; and daughter Estella Leopold (1927–2024) was a noted botanist and conservationist and professor &quot;emerita&quot; at the University of Washington.

Leopold purchased 80 acres in the sand country of central Wisconsin. The once-forested region had been logged, swept by repeated fires, overgrazed by dairy cows, and left barren. He put his theories to work in the field and eventually set to work writing his best-selling &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; (1949) which was finished just prior to his death. Leopold died of a heart attack while battling a wild fire on a neighbor&#x27;s property. Leopold is buried at Aspen Grove Cemetery in Burlington.

Today, Leopold&#x27;s home is an official landmark of the city of Madison.

==Ideas==
Early on, Leopold was assigned to hunt and kill bears, wolves, and mountain lions in New Mexico. Local ranchers hated these predators because of livestock losses, but Leopold came to respect the animals. One day after fatally shooting a wolf, Leopold reached the animal and was transfixed by a &quot;fierce green fire dying in her eyes.&quot; That experience changed him and put him on the path toward an ecocentric outlook. He developed an ecological ethic that replaced the earlier wilderness ethic that stressed the need for human dominance. His rethinking the importance of predators in the balance of nature has resulted in the return of bears and mountain lions to New Mexico wilderness areas.

By the early 1920s, Leopold had concluded that a particular kind of preservation should be embraced in the national forests of the American West. He was prompted to this by the rampant building of roads to accommodate the &quot;proliferation of the automobile&quot; and the related increasingly heavy recreational demands placed on public lands. He was the first to employ the term &quot;wilderness&quot; to describe such preservation. Over the next two decades, he added ethical and scientific rationales to his defense of the wilderness concept. Leopold believed that it is easier to maintain wilderness than to create it. In one essay, he rhetorically asked, &quot;Of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map?&quot; Leopold saw a progress of ethical sensitivity from interpersonal relationships, to relationships to society as a whole, to relationships with the land, leading to a steady diminution of actions based on expediency, conquest, and self-interest. Leopold thus rejected the utilitarianism of conservationists such as Theodore Roosevelt.

By the 1930s, Leopold had become one of the first Americans to publish extensively on the startup discipline of wildlife management. He advocated the scientific management of wildlife habitats by both public and private landholders rather than a reliance on game refuges, hunting laws, and other methods intended to protect specific species of desired game. In his 1933 book &quot;Game Management&quot;, Leopold defined the science of wildlife management as &quot;the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use.&quot; But, as Curt Meine has pointed out, he also considered it to be a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment.

The concept of &quot;wilderness&quot; also took on a new meaning; Leopold no longer saw it as a hunting or recreational ground, but as an arena for a healthy biotic community, including wolves and mountain lions. In 1935, he helped found the Wilderness Society, dedicated to expanding and protecting the nation&#x27;s wilderness areas. He regarded the society as &quot;one of the focal points of a new attitude—an intelligent humility toward Man&#x27;s place in nature.&quot; Science writer Connie Barlow says Leopold wrote eloquently from a perspective that today would be called Religious Naturalism.

Though often forgotten, thinking about population dynamics and consumption also shaped Aldo Leopold’s ecological vision in profound ways. By studying wildlife population fluctuations, Leopold extended many of the ideas about carrying capacity and environmental degradation that Raymond Pearl and Edward Murray East had articulated, and these ideas, in turn, shaped his path-breaking ideas of ecological interconnection. Moreover, although later readers associate Leopold with wildlife ecology, his career helps show how Malthusian ideas of human society intertwined and overlapped with ideas of nature. He was greatly influenced by ecologists who themselves gleaned ideas from Malthusian models of human society, and himself often thought of human events—especially the Great Depression and World War II—in terms of the models of population and consumption that he was developing for animals.

==Nature writing==
Leopold&#x27;s nature writing is notable for its simple directness. His portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved, or had known for many years, displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature. This includes detailed diaries and journals of his Forest Service activity, hunting and field experience, as well as observations and activities at his Sand County farm. He offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems (such as land) out of a sense of a culture or society&#x27;s sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong. He felt the security and prosperity resulting from &quot;mechanization&quot; now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there; however, he also wrote, &quot;Theoretically, the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer&#x27;s chains, but whether it really does is debatable.&quot;

===&quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;===
The book was published in 1949, shortly after Leopold&#x27;s death. One of the well-known quotes from the book which clarifies his land ethic is,

A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise. (p.262) 

The concept of a trophic cascade is put forth in the chapter, &quot;Thinking Like a Mountain&quot;, wherein Leopold realizes that killing a predatory wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem — a conclusion that found sympathetic appreciation generations later:

Thinking Like a Mountain was originally written during World War II and shows that Leopold&#x27;s thinking was shaped by that global cataclysm.

===Land ethic===
In &quot;The Land Ethic&quot;, a chapter in &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;, Leopold delves into conservation in &quot;The Ecological Conscience&quot; section. He wrote: &quot;Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land.&quot; He noted that conservation guidelines at the time boiled down to: &quot;obey the law, vote right, join some organizations, and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land; the government will do the rest.&quot; (p. 243–244)

Leopold explained:

== Legacy ==

In 1950 The Wildlife Society honored Leopold by creating an annual award in his name.

The &quot;Aldo Leopold Foundation&quot; of Baraboo, Wisconsin, was founded in 1982 by Aldo and Estella Leopold&#x27;s five children as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit conservation organization whose mission is &quot;to foster the land ethic through the legacy of Aldo Leopold.&quot; The Aldo Leopold Foundation owns and manages the original Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm and 300 surrounding acres, in addition to several other parcels. Its headquarters is the green-built &quot;Leopold Center&quot; where it conducts educational and land stewardship programs. The foundation also acts as the executor of Leopold&#x27;s literary estate, encourages scholarship on Leopold, and serves as a clearinghouse for information regarding Leopold, his work, and his ideas. It provides interpretive resources and tours for thousands of visitors annually, distributes a curriculum about how to use Leopold&#x27;s writing and ideas in environmental education. The center maintains a robust website and numerous print resources. In 2012, in collaboration with the United States Forest Service, the foundation and the Center for Humans and Nature released the first full-length film about Leopold, titled &quot;Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time&quot;. The film aired on public television stations across the nation and won a Midwest regional Emmy award in the documentary category.
The Aldo Leopold Wilderness in New Mexico&#x27;s Gila National Forest was named after him in 1980.

The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture was established in 1987 at Iowa State University in Ames. It was named in honor of Leopold. Since its founding, it has pioneered new forms of sustainable agriculture practices.

The U.S. Forest Service established the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at the University of Montana, Missoula in 1993. It is &quot;the only Federal research group in the United States dedicated to the development and dissemination of knowledge needed to improve management of wilderness, parks, and similarly protected areas.&quot;

The Aldo Leopold Neighborhood Historic District, which includes Leopold&#x27;s former home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

The Aldo Leopold Legacy Trail System, a system of 42 state trails in Wisconsin, was created by the state in 2007.

The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture in Iowa, created through the 1987 Iowa Groundwater Protection Act is committed to &quot;new ways to farm profitably while conserving natural resources as well as reducing negative environmental and social impacts&quot;.

An organization, the Leopold Heritage Group, is &quot;dedicated to promoting the global legacy of Aldo Leopold in his hometown of Burlington, Iowa.&quot;

In 1985, Leopold was inducted along with John Muir as the first inductees to the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame. 

The Leopold Residence Hall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was named after him. It opened in 2013.

<doc id="217707" wikidata="Q3918988" url="?curid=217707" title="Reference ranges for blood tests">
<text>Reference ranges (reference intervals) for blood tests are sets of values used by a health professional to interpret a set of medical test results from blood samples. Reference ranges for blood tests are studied within the field of clinical chemistry (also known as &quot;clinical biochemistry&quot;, &quot;chemical pathology&quot; or &quot;pure blood chemistry&quot;), the area of pathology that is generally concerned with analysis of bodily fluids.

Blood test results should always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test.

==Interpretation==
A reference range is usually defined as the set of values 95 percent of the normal population falls within (that is, 95% prediction interval). It is determined by collecting data from vast numbers of laboratory tests.

===Plasma or whole blood===
In this article, all values (except the ones listed below) denote blood plasma concentration, which is approximately 60–100% larger than the actual blood concentration if the amount inside red blood cells (RBCs) is negligible. The precise factor depends on hematocrit as well as amount inside RBCs. Exceptions are mainly those values that denote total blood concentration, and in this article they are:
* All values in &quot;Hematology – red blood cells&quot; (except &quot;hemoglobin in plasma&quot;)
* All values in &quot;Hematology – white blood cells&quot;
* Platelet count (Plt)
A few values are for inside red blood cells only:
* Vitamin B9 (folic acid/folate) in red blood cells
* Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)

===Units===
* Mass concentration (g/dL or g/L) is the most common measurement unit in the United States. Is usually given with dL (decilitres) as the denominator in the United States, and usually with L (litres) in, for example, Sweden.
* Molar concentration (mol/L) is used to a higher degree in most of the rest of the world, including the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and Australia and New Zealand.
* International units (IU) are based on measured biological activity or effect, or for some substances, a specified equivalent mass.
* Enzyme activity (kat) is commonly used for e.g. liver function tests like AST, ALT, LD and γ-GT in Sweden.
* Percentages and time-dependent units (mol/s) are used for calculated derived parameters, e.g. for beta cell function in homeostasis model assessment or thyroid&#x27;s secretory capacity.

===Arterial or venous===
If not otherwise specified, a reference range for a blood test is generally the venous range, as the standard process of obtaining a sample is by venipuncture. An exception is for acid–base and blood gases, which are generally given for arterial blood.

Still, the blood values are approximately equal between the arterial and venous sides for most substances, with the exception of acid–base, blood gases and drugs (used in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) assays). Arterial levels for drugs are generally higher than venous levels because of extraction while passing through tissues.

===Usual or optimal===
Reference ranges are usually given as what are the usual (or &quot;normal&quot;) values found in the population, more specifically the prediction interval that 95% of the population fall into. This may also be called &quot;standard range&quot;. In contrast, &quot;optimal (health) range&quot; or &quot;therapeutic target&quot; is a reference range or limit that is based on concentrations or levels that are associated with optimal health or minimal risk of related complications and diseases. For most substances presented, the optimal levels are the ones normally found in the population as well. More specifically, optimal levels are generally close to a central tendency of the values found in the population. However, usual and optimal levels may differ substantially, most notably among vitamins and blood lipids, so these tables give limits on both standard and optimal (or target) ranges. In addition, some values, including troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide, are given as the estimated appropriate cutoffs to distinguish healthy people from people with specific conditions, which here are myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, respectively, for the aforementioned substances.

===Variability===

References range may vary with age, sex, race, pregnancy, diet, use of prescribed or herbal drugs and stress. Reference ranges often depend on the analytical method used, for reasons such as inaccuracy, lack of standardisation, lack of certified reference material and differing antibody reactivity. Also, reference ranges may be inaccurate when the reference groups used to establish the ranges are small.

==Sorted by concentration==

===By mass and molarity===
Smaller, narrower boxes indicate a more tight homeostatic regulation when measured as standard &quot;usual&quot; reference range.
Hormones predominate at the left part of the scale, shown with a red at ng/L or pmol/L, being in very low concentration. There appears to be the greatest cluster of substances in the yellow part (μg/L or nmol/L), becoming sparser in the green part (mg/L or μmol/L). However, there is another cluster containing many metabolic substances like cholesterol and glucose at the limit with the blue part (g/L or mmol/L).

The unit conversions of substance concentrations from the molar to the mass concentration scale above are made as follows:
* Numerically:
:formula_1
* Measured directly in distance on the scales:
:formula_2,
where distance is the direct (not logarithmic) distance in number of decades or &quot;octaves&quot; to the right the mass concentration is found. To translate from mass to molar concentration, the dividend (molar mass and the divisor (1000) in the division change places, or, alternatively, &quot;distance to right&quot; is changed to &quot;distance to left&quot;. Substances with a molar mass around 1000g/mol (e.g. thyroxine) are almost vertically aligned in the mass and molar images. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, on the other hand, with a molar mass of 4540, is 0.7 decades to the right in the mass image. Substances with molar mass below 1000g/mol (e.g. electrolytes and metabolites) would have &quot;negative&quot; distance, that is, masses deviating to the left.
Many substances given in mass concentration are not given in molar amount because they haven&#x27;t been added to the article.

The diagram above can also be used as an alternative way to convert any substance concentration (not only the normal or optimal ones) from molar to mass units and vice versa for those substances appearing in both scales, by measuring how much they are horizontally displaced from one another (representing the molar mass for that substance), and using the same distance from the concentration to be converted to determine the equivalent concentration in terms of the other unit. For example, on a certain monitor, the horizontal distance between the upper limits for parathyroid hormone in pmol/L and pg/mL may be 7 cm, with the mass concentration to the right. A molar concentration of, for example, 5 pmol/L would therefore correspond to a mass concentration located 7 cm to the right in the mass diagram, that is, approximately 45 pg/mL.

===By units===
Units do not necessarily imply anything about molarity or mass.
A few substances are below this main interval, e.g. thyroid stimulating hormone, being measured in mU/L, or above, like rheumatoid factor and CA19-9, being measured in U/mL.

===By enzyme activity===
===White blood cells===
==Sorted by category==

===Ions and trace metals===

Included here are also related binding proteins, like ferritin and transferrin for iron, and ceruloplasmin for copper.
* Note: Although &#x27;mEq&#x27; for mass and &#x27;mEq/L&#x27; are sometimes used in the United States and elsewhere, they are not part of SI and are now considered redundant.

===Acid–base and blood gases===
If arterial/venous is not specified for an acid–base or blood gas value, then it generally refers to arterial, and not venous which otherwise is standard for other blood tests.

Acid–base and blood gases are among the few blood constituents that exhibit substantial difference between arterial and venous values. Still, pH, bicarbonate and base excess show a high level of inter-method reliability between arterial and venous tests, so arterial and venous values are roughly equivalent for these.

===Liver function===


===Cardiac tests===



===Lipids===


===Tumour markers===


===Endocrinology===

====Thyroid hormones====


====Sex hormones====

The diagrams below take inter-cycle and inter-woman variability into account in displaying reference ranges for estradiol, progesterone, FSH and LH.


====Other hormones====


===Vitamins===
Also including the vitamin B12)-related amino acid homocysteine.
===Toxic Substances===
===Hematology===

====Red blood cells====
These values (except &quot;Hemoglobin in plasma&quot;) are for total blood and not only blood plasma.

====White blood cells====
These values are for total blood and not only blood plasma.

====Coagulation====
===Immunology===

====Acute phase proteins====
Acute phase proteins are markers of inflammation.
====Isotypes of antibodies====

====Autoantibodies====

Autoantibodies are usually absent or very low, so instead of being given in standard reference ranges, the values usually denote where they are said to be present, or whether the test is a positive test. There may also be an &quot;equivocal&quot; interval, where it is uncertain whether there is a significantly increased level.

====Other immunology====
===Other enzymes and proteins===

===Other electrolytes and metabolites===
Electrolytes and metabolites:
For iron and copper, some related proteins are also included.

<doc id="217709" wikidata="Q732804" url="?curid=217709" title="Tommy Thompson">
<text>Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is an American politician who served as the 19th United States secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001 to 2005 in the cabinet of President George W. Bush. Before that, he was the 42nd governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001) and Republican floor leader in the Wisconsin State Assembly (1981–1987). Thompson is the longest-serving governor in Wisconsin history, holding office from January 1987 until February 2001, and is the only person to be elected to the office four times. 

During his tenure as governor he was also chair of Amtrak, the nation&#x27;s passenger rail service. He was chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 1991 and 1992, and the National Governors Association in 1995 and 1996. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson became a partner in the law-firm Akin Gump and Independent Chairman of Deloitte&#x27;s Center for Health Solutions. He has served on the boards of 22 other organizations. Thompson most recently served as interim president of the University of Wisconsin System from 2020 to 2022.

Thompson was a candidate for President of the United States, running in the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, but withdrew from the race before voting began. He was the Republican nominee for United States Senate in Wisconsin in the 2012 election, vying to replace retiring senator Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Democrat Tammy Baldwin in what was his only statewide election loss.

==Early life, education, and military service==

===Childhood and family===
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin. His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store. His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for governor of Wisconsin in 2002.

He has a daughter, Kelli Thompson, who was Wisconsin&#x27;s state public defender until she stepped down in 2023.

===Education===
Thompson earned his bachelor and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively. While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.

===Military service===
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966. The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.

After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years. His final rank was captain.

==Early political career (1966–1987)==

===Wisconsin Assembly===
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly. In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.

In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly&#x27;s assistant minority leader and its minority leader in 1981. Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname &quot;Dr. No&quot; by the frustrated majority.

===American Legislative Exchange Council===
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization. Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: &quot;I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I&#x27;d take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, &#x27;That&#x27;s mine.&#x27;&quot; ALEC awarded Thompson its &quot;Thomas Jefferson Award&quot; in 1991.

===1979 congressional campaign===
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack. Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979. State Senator Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.

==Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)==
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at days.

===Elections===
;1986

Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field. He defeated Earl 53%–46%.

;1990
Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.

;1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democratic state senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.

;1998
Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.

===Tenure===
Thompson is best known nationally for changes in Wisconsin&#x27;s welfare system, which was radically downsized, before similar ideas were adopted nationally. Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.

Thompson was called a &quot;pioneer&quot; for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers. In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country&#x27;s first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don&#x27;t provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. At the time, Wisconsin governors had the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.

Thompson&#x27;s welfare reform policies were criticized. Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote that &quot;many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare&quot;. Many of Wisconsin&#x27;s poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state&#x27;s poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson&#x27;s welfare overhaul.

The growth of the state budget during Thompson&#x27;s 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.

====Transportation focus====
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans. Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be secretary of transportation.

While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001 through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.

Beginning in the 1990s, Thompson proposed modernizing passenger rail in the state. In 1999, Thompson proposed a modernization and extension of the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; rail service (between Chicago and Milwaukee), extending to beyond Milwaukee to also serve Madison, Wisconsin and Minnesota&#x27;s Twin Cities (Minneapolis–Saint Paul). Thompson was promoting the &quot;Midwest Rail Initiative&quot; in his capacity as Amtrak&#x27;s chairman, which included a proposal for a line connecting these cities. In early 2000, he gave further details, proposing first to establish new service between Milwaukee and Madison with $50 million in state funding and $100 million in federal funding, hoping to inaugurate a high-speed service by 2003, which would include a station at Dane County Regional Airport. As part of his plans, Thompson initiated preliminary studies that resulted in the construction of the Milwaukee Airport Rail Station.

====Taxes====
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin. Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987, cutting income tax rates three times and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.

When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he &quot;never raised taxes&quot;, he earned a rating of &quot;False&quot; from PolitiFact-Wisconsin. PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson&#x27;s terms. Politifact said in its rating, &quot;Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way.&quot; Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson&#x27;s claim that Wisconsin&#x27;s overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.

Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor&#x27;s partial-veto power, were taxes on the state&#x27;s wealthiest residents. In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy, at the same time that he pushed forward a 6% cut in welfare benefits.

====Executive power consolidation====
As governor, Thompson took major steps to transfer decision-making power from elected constitutional officers and independent agencies to his political appointees. Among the changes:
* The Secretary of State&#x27;s office was gutted of its responsibilities concerning business registration and Uniform Commercial Code administration. These functions were in turn vested in Thompson&#x27;s appointee at the newly created Department of Financial Institutions, which also regulates depository institutions and the securities industry.
* Enforcement of consumer protection laws was taken away from the elected Wisconsin Attorney General and transferred to Thompson&#x27;s appointee at what is now the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.
* The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor, which for decades prior functioned as an ombudsman for the state&#x27;s natural resources protected under the Public Trust Doctrine, had its budget significantly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
* An attempt was made to transfer education policy to an appointed education secretary after the constitutional head of the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, the elected Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin, saw most of the office&#x27;s powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court later ruled the move unconstitutional.

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional. His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional. Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, &quot;despite a clear ruling&quot; from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.

====Tobacco====
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests. His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris. He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and &quot;delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.

====Abortion====
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.

===Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers===

In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its &quot;Voigt Decision&quot;, which found that Wisconsin&#x27;s Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.

During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa&#x27;s rights. Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million. Thompson&#x27;s administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the &quot;Voigt Decision&quot;. The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans&#x27; lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.

In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration&#x27;s legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger. Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992. On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.

===Other leadership roles===
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States, in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.

===Consideration as prospective Republican vice presidential nominee===
Thompson&#x27;s name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.

Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position. However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to &quot;bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements&quot;, and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson&#x27;s lack of finesse in their interactions. After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration in August, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been &quot;scared to death&quot; of the process and the spotlight of the position. In 2000, Thompson was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for George W. Bush.

==Secretary of Health and Human Services==

Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001. Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004, and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.

While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, reorganize the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests, thereby providing health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans. In the aftermath of 9/11, he also worked on strengthening the nation&#x27;s preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.

===Key initiatives===
Thompson&#x27;s major initiatives were &quot;efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes.&quot; He also was elected chairman of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2003.

===Medicare prescription drug-benefit===
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush&#x27;s Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush&#x27;s first term, Thompson frequently served as the president&#x27;s point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson&#x27;s tenure as HHS secretary.

As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken. In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.

In her Senate campaign, Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) said in 2012 that Thompson was responsible for forbidding Medicare to negotiate drug prices, a statement that Politifact rated as &quot;True.&quot; Thompson said that he had nothing to do with that provision, a statement Politifact rated as &quot;False.&quot; The New York Times reported, &quot;In December (2004), just before leaving office, Mr. Leavitt’s predecessor, Tommy G. Thompson, said he wished Congress had given him the authority to negotiate prices for Medicare beneficiaries, as he negotiated discounts on antibiotics during the anthrax scare of 2001.&quot;

===2001 anthrax scare===
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming &quot;utterly overtaken by events&quot; and issuing &quot;early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts&quot;.

At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that &quot;would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication&quot;. Thompson offered the media a &quot;far-fetched&quot; suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.
Thompson&#x27;s words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, as potentially undermining public confidence, and as the &quot;kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts&quot;. Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.

===Alleged politicizing of science===
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson&#x27;s office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit&#x27;s director. In return, Thompson&#x27;s office sent back to the unit&#x27;s director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as &quot;lightweights&quot; with &quot;no scientific credibility.&quot; Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having &quot;signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush.&quot; This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a &quot;politicization of science&quot; under President George W. Bush&#x27;s administration.

===Resignation press conference===
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists. Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President&#x27;s reelection at the administration&#x27;s request. Some noted, in particular, his words: &quot;I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that.&quot;

==Post-government private sector work==
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.

Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.

In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson&#x27;s consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson&#x27;s work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.

A number of those companies and organizations (as of 2012), &quot;he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors.&quot; An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that &quot;either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight.&quot;

Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying. There, Thompson provided &quot;strategic advice&quot; to the lobbyists in the firm&#x27;s health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm&#x27;s clients.

He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Independent Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Solutions. Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.

==Initial post-government political activities==
Soon after leaving office, Thompson began publicly proposing policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary. However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions). These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.

Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Harvard Kennedy School conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy. Thompson also authored a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; op-ed on the topic.

One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, &quot;Plain Talk about Health&quot;.

==2008 presidential campaign==

After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.

===Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections===
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker. He said, &quot;I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be.&quot; 

He later claimed that he did not hear the question correctly, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace.&quot; He would also claim that he had been feeling sick on the day of the debate, and that he was distracted when that question was asked by his own impending need to use a bathroom.

====Gaffe about Jews, Israel====


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.

On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance. Thompson stated: &quot;You know that&#x27;s sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that.&quot; Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments, adding: &quot;I just want to clarify something because I didn&#x27;t (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You&#x27;ve been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.&quot; Thompson&#x27;s comments caused &quot;unease in the room&quot; as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson&#x27;s use of this stereotype.

Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as &quot;Jewish bonds&quot;. He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group

Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson&#x27;s words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.

The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that &quot;there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become&quot; than Thompson&#x27;s belief that &quot;repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would &quot;please&quot; his Jewish listeners!&quot;

After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold. Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.

===Iowa straw poll; withdrawal and endorsements===
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race. In October, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that &quot;Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America&#x27;s mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership.&quot; He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani&#x27;s withdrawal from the presidential race. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain&#x27;s campaign as saying, &quot;No. I don&#x27;t know who is.&quot;

==2012 U.S. Senate election==
While Thompson gave some consideration to running for the governorship again in 2010, he more seriously considered running for the United States Senate in Wisconsin&#x27;s 2010 election. Ultimately, however, he declined to run for either office in 2010. On September 19, 2011, Thompson announced he would run in 2012 for the seat vacated by Herb Kohl. He more formally launched his campaign with an announcement video on December 1.

===Political positions during 2012 campaign===
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, &quot;Who better than me, that&#x27;s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?&quot; When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.

Thompson favored making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15% flat tax.

===Republican primary===
After a bitter four-way race, Thompson won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012. His opponents in the primary had included Eric Hovde (a millionaire hedge fund manager), Mark Neumann (a former congressman), and Jeff Fitzgerald (speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly). During the primary, attention was raised to the fact that in 2008 Thompson had given campaign contributions to two Democrats – $250 to Michigan U.S. senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year&#x27;s elections. That same election cycle, he had given $1,200 to the Wisconsin Republican Party. The attacks against Thompson led to Mike Huckabee (a Republican who was the former governor of Arkansas, a former presidential candidate, and an active conservative media figure) offering a defense and endorsement of Thompson.

===General election===
Ahead of the general election, ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson&#x27;s campaign in the latter part of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, receiving 45.9% against Baldwin&#x27;s 51.5%. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state&#x27;s two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.

==Later political involvement==
Over the course of the Republican primaries for the United States presidential election of 2016 Thompson endorsed a number of candidates. Before the primaries, he initially endorsed Scott Walker&#x27;s campaign. After Walker withdrew his candidacy, Thompson gave his endorsement to the campaign of Jeb Bush. In March 2016 (a month after Bush ended his campaign), Thompson endorsed the campaign of John Kasich and became chair of Kasich&#x27;s Wisconsin state campaign operation. In early July, Thompson, endorsed Donald Trump (the party&#x27;s presumptive nominee) and served as a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention.

Thompson considered running for Wisconsin governor again in 2022, which would mean challenging incumbent Democrat Tony Evers. In March 2022, he visited Mar-a-Lago to consult with former president Trump about such a possibility. In April, Thompson claimed that he would not be running for governor. He claimed that he had received encouragement from Trump, but was ultimately dissuaded from running by objections from his own immediate family. In July, Thompson gave his own endorsement in the Republican gubernatorial primary to Tim Michels (the Trump-backed candidate). Trump and Thompson&#x27;s endorsements of Michels was seen as helping him to overtake former lieutenant governor Rebecca Kleefisch in the polls. While Michels succeeded in securing the Republican nomination, he went on to lose to Evers.

In October 2022, Thompson joined the Council for Responsible Social Media project launched by Issue One to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States co-chaired by former House Democratic Caucus Leader Dick Gephardt and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.

Thompson served as a delegate to the 2024 Republican National Convention (held in Milwaukee), and delivered a speech at the convention. Thompson claimed that it was the twelfth consecutive Republican convention to which he had been a delegate. In the 2024 presidential election, Thompson once again endorsed Trump, and sent Trump&#x27;s campaign advice on campaigning in Wisconsin. Thompson also campaigned alongside Trump in Wisconsin.

==President of the University of Wisconsin System (2020–22)==

In the fall of 2019, incumbent University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross announced his intention to retire. This kicked off a search by the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents to find his successor. In what was seen as a flawed candidate search, complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Wisconsin, the board initially was poised to offer the position to University of Alaska System President Jim Johnsen. Johnsen was ultimately forced to withdraw amidst vocal opposition from University of Wisconsin System faculty and students. A week later, after closed-door sessions, the board named Thompson as the interim president. Thompson served nearly two years as interim president before announcing in January 2022 that he would step down, effective March 18, 2022.

<text>Nigel David Short (born 1 June 1965) is an English chess grandmaster, columnist, coach and commentator who has been the FIDE Director for Chess Development since September 2022. Short earned the title of grandmaster at the age of 19 and was ranked third in the world by FIDE from July 1988 to July 1989. In 1993, he became the first English player to play a World Chess Championship match, when he qualified to play Garry Kasparov in the PCA world championship in London, where Kasparov won 12½ to 7½.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1999 Birthday Honours for services to chess.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Short was born 1 June 1965 in Leigh, Lancashire. He is the second of three children (all boys) of David and Jean Short. His father was a journalist and his mother was a school secretary. He grew up in Atherton, going to St Philip&#x27;s Primary School on Bolton Old Road. He studied at the independent Bolton School and Leigh College.

Short began playing chess at the age of five after watching his father teach his older brother Martin. He was a member both of Atherton Chess Club, which was founded by his father, and later of Bolton Chess Club, which had initially rejected him (aged seven) for being too young. His parents divorced when he was 13 years old. Short left school at age 17, having completed four O-levels, to focus on chess full-time.

== Prodigy to Grandmaster ==

Short learned chess at age five from his father. A chess prodigy, Short first attracted significant media attention as a 10-year-old by defeating Viktor Korchnoi, then ranked No. 2 in the world, in a simultaneous exhibition in London over 31 boards, where Short was the only victor. He was virtually self-taught. In 1977, he became the youngest-ever participant in the British Chess Championship by qualifying through the North West Zonal three days before his 12th birthday. In the event itself, he defeated ten-time British champion Jonathan Penrose, and finished with 5/11, an excellent showing for a debutant. 

Short dominated British youth chess during this period, and earned a Master rating with his showing in the 1977 British finals. In 1978 he won his first adult national title when he won the British Lightning Championship aged 13 years 5 months 11 days, a title which he won again in 1980. 

In 1979, in the British Championship at Chester, Short tied for first place with John Nunn and Robert Bellin, earning his first International Master norm; Bellin won the title on tiebreak. Later in 1979, Short tied for first place in the World Championship for players under age 16, the World Cadet Championship, at Belfort, France, but lost to Argentinian Marcello Tempone on tiebreak. He became (at the time) the youngest International Master in chess history by scoring 8/15 in the Hastings Premier in 1979/80, breaking Bobby Fischer&#x27;s record from 1958. 

Participating in four World Junior Championships (1980–83), Short achieved his best result during his first attempt, when he placed second to Garry Kasparov in 1980 at Dortmund. Short represented England in international team play for the first time at the 1983 European Team finals in Plovdiv. He was awarded the grandmaster title in 1984, aged 19—becoming the youngest grandmaster in the world at the time, being later supplanted by Simen Agdestein.

== World Championship candidate ==

Short&#x27;s arrival on the World Chess Championship title began in earnest in 1985 when he narrowly qualified from the Biel Interzonal to become Britain&#x27;s first-ever candidate. He needed a playoff to advance past John van der Wiel and Eugenio Torre for the last berth, after the three had tied in regulation play. But the Montpellier Candidates Tournament brought Short little success, as he scored 7/15 to finish in 10th place. In the next cycle, he again qualified by winning the 1987 Subotica Interzonal with Jon Speelman. The Candidates stage had by this time reverted to its traditional match format: Short defeated Gyula Sax (+2=3) in Saint John, Canada, in 1988, but then unexpectedly lost (−2=3) to Speelman in London.

Short&#x27;s next attempt proved his most successful. He defeated Mikhail Gurevich in the last round of the Manila Interzonal and finished equal third with Viswanathan Anand, behind Vassily Ivanchuk and Boris Gelfand, qualifying him as a Candidate for the third successive time. Meeting Speelman again in the 8/Final, in London, he tied a close match (+2-2=4) before edging his older opponent 1.5-0.5 in the tie-break. The 1/4 final, against Gelfand, in Brussels, was a bloodthirsty affair in which Short eventually prevailed (+4-2=2). In the semifinal, in 1992, the Englishman overcame former World Champion Anatoly Karpov (+4−2=4) in a match that was described as &quot;the end of an era&quot;. In the final, in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Short defeated Dutchman Jan Timman (+5−3=5) to earn the right to meet defending World Champion Garry Kasparov. The King walk, perhaps the most famous in recent history, where Nigel Short defeated Jan Timman in Tilburg in 1991, was voted as one of the hundred greatest chess games in a list compiled by FM Graham Burgess, and GMs John Nunn and John Emms.

== World title match, London 1993 ==
According to Short and Kasparov, the head of the chess world&#x27;s governing body FIDE, Florencio Campomanes, in breach of FIDE rules, decided the location of the match (Manchester) and the prize fund without consulting them. In her book &quot;Nigel Short: Quest for the Crown&quot; (Cadogan 1993), the British WIM and author Cathy Forbes wrote that at no time in the 1993 bidding process did FIDE actually receive a conforming world championship match bid. In response, Short and Kasparov promptly formed a rival organisation, the Professional Chess Association. The resulting match—sponsored by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper—was held under the new body&#x27;s auspices in London from September to October 1993. Kasparov won convincingly (+6−1=13) – the largest margin of victory in a world title contest since Botvinnik defeated Tal in 1961.

=== Controversy ===

The unprecedented rebellion organized by Kasparov and Short resulted in a parallel World Championship cycle organized by FIDE, featuring Anatoly Karpov and Jan Timman playing a title match later in 1993, which was won by Karpov. Short and Kasparov were both sanctioned by FIDE, and the situation led to enormous controversy and upheaval in the chess world for the next several years.

== Major tournament results ==

Short won the British Chess Championship in 1984, 1987 and 1998, and the English Championship in 1991 (the only year in which the latter event was held). He was the Commonwealth Champion in 2004 (Mumbai), 2006 (Mumbai) and 2008 (Nagpur). He won the 2006 EU Individual Open Chess Championship in Liverpool and took a share of second place in 2008 when it was held there again. He has finished outright first, or tied for first, in dozens of other international tournaments, including Geneva (1979), Belfort, World Under 16 (1979), the BBC Master Game (1981), Amsterdam OHRA (1982), Baku (1983), Esbjerg (1984), British Rapidplay Chess Championship (1986), Wijk aan Zee (1986, 1987), Reykjavík (1987), Amsterdam VSB (1988, 1991, 1992, 1993), Hastings (1987/88, 1988/89), Pärnu (1996), Groningen (1996), Tallinn/Pärnu (1998), Isle of Man Monarch Assurance 1998, Dhaka United Insurance (1999), Shymkent (1999), Pamplona (1999/2000), Linares Open (2000), Tan Chin Nam Cup, Beijing (2000), Sigeman and Co. Malmö (2002, 2009, 2013 joint first shared with Richárd Rapport and Nils Grandelius), Gibraltar (2003, 2004, 2012), Budapest Hunguest Hotels (2003), Samba Cup, Skanderborg (2003), Taiyuan (2004), the Politiken Cup (2006), Bazna (2008), the Staunton Memorial (2009), Bangkok Chess Club Open (2011, 2012, 2015, 2017), Luanda (2011), 7th Edmonton International (2012), Bunratty (2012, 2016, 2017, 2020), RA Club Ottawa (2012), Pühajärve Rapid Chess Tournament (2012), Spicenet Tanzania Open (2013), PokerStars Isle of Man (2014), Zaw Win Lay Memorial Yangon (2014), the South African Open (2015) the 1st Stars Cup in Anzali (2016), the British Knockout Championship (2016), the Bacolod Negros Open (2017), the Pre-League Blitz Open in Kampala (2018), the GM Nigel Short Blitz in Lagos (2018), and the Moja GM Tournament, in Kimberley, (2022).

Short won the 50th edition of the Canadian Open Chess Championship in Ottawa in 2013, edging Canadian Grandmaster Eric Hansen on tiebreak after both finished with unbeaten 7½/9 scores.

Arguably Short&#x27;s finest tournament performance came at the Amsterdam VSB tournament in 1991, where he tied for first place with Valery Salov ahead of both Kasparov and Karpov.

== Match results ==
In addition to World Championship cycle results already mentioned above, Short has enjoyed other success as a match player, beating US Champion Lev Alburt in Foxborough, Massachusetts in 1985 by the score of 7–1 (+6=2). He has also defeated Utut Adianto (+3=3) in Jakarta 1995, Étienne Bacrot in Albert 2000 (+3−1=2), Hannes Stefánsson in Reykjavík 2002 (+4−1=1), Ehsan Ghaem Maghami in Tehran 2003 (+2=4) Zahar Efimenko in Mukachevo 2009 (+2−1=3) and Hou Yifan in Hoogeveen 2016 (+2-1=3). Short lost to Joel Benjamin by 2½–1½ at London 1983, drew with Eugenio Torre (+1−1=4) in Manila 1988, drew with Timman (3–3) in an exhibition match at Hilversum in 1989, defeated Boris Gulko in extra games in the PCA Candidates&#x27; quarterfinals at New York 1994, lost to Gata Kamsky by (5½–1½) in the PCA semi-finals at Linares 1995, and drew with Anish Giri in Amsterdam 2010 (+1-1=2).

In a return to Tehran in March 2013, Short played a second match against the Iranian player Ehsan Ghaem Maghami. Billed as &quot;Talking Chess&quot;, the contest comprised four games with a classic time control, four games of rapid chess and eight games of blitz. As the classic games progressed, the players gave an intermittent live commentary, aimed at increasing the understanding of the live and television audiences, who could contrast and compare the player&#x27;s own thoughts and assessments. Short won the classic games (+2=2), the rapid games (+3−1) and the blitz games (+3−2=3).

== International team record ==
Short made his international team debut in the European Team Chess Championship at age 17 at Plovdiv 1983. He represented England in 17 consecutive Olympiads between 1984 and 2016. Short&#x27;s main highlights are: team silver medals in the chess Olympiads of Thessaloniki 1984, Dubai 1986 (where he also took gold medal for the best individual performance on board three) and Thessaloniki 1988. He took a team bronze in the Novi Sad Olympiad of 1990, and led England to fourth-place finishes in both 1994 and 1996. He led the English team to victory in the 1997 Euroteams at Pula, and was a member of the bronze winning team in 1992, and of fourth place teams in 1983 and 2001. He was a member of three English teams in the World Team Chess Championships of 1985 (team bronze), 1989 (team bronze), and 1997 (team fourth).

== Other activities ==
Short was appointed to serve as one of several Vice Presidents of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) in October 2018. He has written chess columns and book reviews for the British newspapers &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He wrote for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; for a decade and for &quot;The Guardian&quot; between 2005 and 19 October 2006. He reported on the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 in San Luis, Argentina, for the ChessBase website. He wrote a column, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, for &quot;New in Chess&quot; magazine from January 2011 until December 2018. During the World Chess Championship 2013 he wrote a series of articles for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;. In 2014 he began writing a column for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, interviewing Sol Campbell in the first article.

He has individually coached young prodigies Pentala Harikrishna, Sergey Karjakin, David Howell and Parimarjan Negi. He worked as national coach of the Islamic Republic of Iran from 2006 to 2007. His first assignment led to their unexpectedly capturing a team bronze medal at the Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, in 2006. In the nine chess events at the Asian Indoor Games in Macau 2007, Iran took a silver and two bronze medals.

Short was made an honorary Fellow of the then Bolton Institute of Higher Education in 1993, and was admitted to the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Bolton in 2010. In 1999 he was appointed MBE, in recognition of his chess accomplishments. In August 2005, he was unanimously elected secretary general of the Commonwealth Chess Association. He became its president in June 2006, stepping down in January 2008. He was the FIDE delegate for the ECF between 2009 and 2014.

During important chess events in recent years, Short is often engaged for commentary as part of live broadcasts on the Internet. Chess historian Edward Winter has named him one of the top five Internet broadcasters.

In the Introduction chapter of his book &quot;Winning&quot;, published in 2021, Short said &quot;This is my first book, and it has taken a global pandemic for me to write it&quot; and &quot;I must confess that all books with my name on the cover – and with profound apologies to those who bought them – were all ghost-written&quot;.

An October 2021 blog post on Chess.com made the case that the anonymous grandmaster player &quot;honestgirl&quot; was, in fact, Nigel Short, based on their similar preferences for variations of the game, and based on the fact that &quot;honestgirl&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Nigel Short&quot;.

== Incidents ==
In 2001, Short told &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; chess column that he believed he had been secretly playing the reclusive former chess champion Bobby Fischer on the online chess platform Internet Chess Club in speed chess matches. Fischer denied ownership of the account.

In January 2007, Short gave an interview to the Indian newspaper &quot;DNA&quot;, in which he called for an inquiry to examine allegations that Veselin Topalov cheated during the World Championship in San Luis.

In the same &quot;DNA&quot; interview, Short was critical of the role of members of the Appeals Committee at the 2005 and 2006 World Championships, in particular FIDE Vice President Zurab Azmaiparashvili, whom he described as &quot;singularly inappropriate for such work having, by his own admission, cheated in winning the 2003 European Championship.&quot; Azmaiparashvili filed a formal complaint to the FIDE Ethics Commission, which convened in July 2007. While dismissing the main complaints against Short, the commission sanctioned him for a minor violation of the FIDE Code of Ethics for his use of the word &quot;dunderhead&quot;.

In 2015, Short claimed that men are biologically better suited to chess than women, and that women have other skills, citing his wife&#x27;s superior emotional intelligence as an example. In response to widespread criticism for these comments, Short reaffirmed his position, claiming in an interview that &quot;it&#x27;s quite easy to demonstrate there is a fairly substantial gap between men and women&quot; and dismissing his repeated defeat by Judit Polgar as &quot;irrelevant&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Short resides in Greece and married drama therapist Rhea Argyro Karageorgiou in 1987. The couple have two children. He is an atheist.

<text>The welfare state of the United Kingdom began to evolve in the 1900s and early 1910s, and comprises expenditures by the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland intended to improve health, education, employment and social security. The British system has been classified as a liberal welfare state system.

==History==

Before the official establishment of the modern welfare state, clear examples of social welfare existed to help the poor and vulnerable within British society. A key date in the welfare state&#x27;s history is 1563; when Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s government encouraged the wealthier members of society to give to the poor, by passing the Poor Act 1562.

The welfare state in the modern sense was anticipated by the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832 which found that the Poor Relief Act 1601 (a part of the English Poor laws) was subject to widespread abuse and promoted squalor, idleness and criminality in its recipients, compared to those who received private charity. Accordingly, the qualifications for receiving aid were tightened up, forcing many recipients to either turn to private charity or accept employment.

Opinions began to be changed late in the century by reports drawn up by men such as Seebohm Rowntree and Charles Booth into the levels of poverty in Britain. These reports indicated that in the massive industrial cities, between one-quarter and one-third of the population were living below the poverty line.

A 2022 study linked trade shocks during the first globalization (1870–1914) with increased support for a welfare state and reduced support for the Conservative Party.

===Liberal reforms===

The late nineteenth century saw the emergence of New Liberalism within the Liberal Party, which advocated state intervention as a means of guaranteeing freedom and removing obstacles to it such as poverty and unemployment. The policies of the New Liberalism are now known as social liberalism.
The New Liberals included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse, and John A. Hobson. They saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favourable social and economic circumstances. In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented, and interventionist state.

After the historic 1906 victory, the Liberal Party launched the welfare state with a series of major welfare reforms in 1906–1914. The reforms were greatly extended over the next forty years. The Liberal Party introduced multiple reforms on a range of issues, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British welfare state. Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The People&#x27;s Budget of 1909, championed by David Lloyd George and fellow Liberal Winston Churchill, introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country&#x27;s policies. In the Liberal camp, as noted by one study, &quot;the Budget was on the whole enthusiastically received.&quot; It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, high incomes, and land – taxation that fell heavily on the rich. The new money was to be made available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his National Insurance Act, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his Unemployment Insurance Act.

The minimum wage was introduced in Great Britain in 1909 for certain low-wage industries and expanded to numerous industries, including farm labour, by 1920. However, by the 1920s, a new perspective was offered by reformers to emphasise the usefulness of family allowance targeted at low-income families was the alternative to relieving poverty without distorting the labour market. The trade unions and the Labour Party adopted this view. In 1945, family allowances were introduced; minimum wages faded from view.

The experience of almost total state control during the Second World War had encouraged the belief that the state might be able to solve problems in wide areas of national life.

The Liberal government of 1906–1914 implemented welfare policies concerning three main groups in society: the old, the young and working people.

===Beveridge Report and Labour===

The aftermath of the First World War boosted demands for social reform, and led to a permanent increase in the role of the state in British society. The end of the war also brought a period of unemployment and poverty, particularly in northern industrial towns, that deepened into the Great Depression by the 1930s.

During the war, the government became much more involved in people&#x27;s lives via governmental organisation of the rationing of foodstuffs, clothing and fuel and extra milk and meals being given to expectant mothers and children. The wartime coalition, and the introduction of family allowances. Many people welcomed this government intervention and wanted it to go further.

The Beveridge Report of 1942, (which identified five &quot;Giant Evils&quot; in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease) essentially recommended a national, compulsory, flat rate insurance scheme which would combine unemployment, widows benefit, child benefit and retirement benefits into one central government support scheme. In regards to healthcare Beveridge preferred the contemporary healthcare system of voluntary and private hospitals &quot;more than that of a taxpayer funded healthcare&quot; believing more people would access healthcare when they need it if they were voluntarily involved in their own healthcare. But it is key to note Beveridge still emphasised that healthcare should be accessible for everyone in the United Kingdom and that people should give what they can according to their means when receiving healthcare in voluntary hospitals. Beveridge himself was careful to emphasise that unemployment benefits should be held to a subsistence level, and after six months would be conditional on work or training, so as not to encourage abuse of the system. That was however predicated on the concept of the &quot;maintenance of employment&quot; which meant &#x27;it should be possible to make unemployment of any individual for more than 26 weeks continuously a rare thing in normal times&#x27; and recognised that the imposition of a training condition would be impractical if the unemployed were numbered by the million. After its victory in the 1945 general election, the Labour Party pledged to eradicate the Giant Evils, and undertook policy measures to provide for the people of the United Kingdom &quot;from the cradle to the grave.&quot; While the original intention of the report was to abolish these Giant Evils, the implementation of these suggested policies aimed to reduce income, health, and educational inequalities. However, the lack of real follow-through on Beveridge&#x27;s recommended strategies meant that the Labour government ultimately failed to abolish poverty with their welfare reforms.

Included among the laws passed were the National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29), National Insurance Act 1946, and National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946.

==Impact==
This policy resulted in increased expenditure and a widening of what was considered to be the state&#x27;s responsibility. In addition to the central services of education, health, unemployment and sickness allowances, the welfare state also included the idea of increasing redistributive taxation, and increasing regulation of industry, food, and housing (better safety regulations, weights and measures controls, etc.)

The foundation of the National Health Service (NHS) did not involve building new hospitals, but nationalisation of existing municipal provision and charitable foundations. The aim was not to substantially increase provision but to standardise care across the country; indeed William Beveridge believed that the overall cost of medical care would decrease, as people became healthier and so needed less treatment.

However, instead of falling, the cost of the NHS has risen by 4% annually on average due to an ageing population, leading to a reduction in provision. Charges for dentures, and spectacles were introduced in 1951 by the same Labour government that had founded the NHS three years earlier, and prescription charges by the successive Conservative Government were introduced in 1952. In 1988, free eye tests for all were abolished, although they are now free for the over-60s.

After 1979, Margaret Thatcher had laid the post-war Keynesian consensus to rest, in favour of an Individualist and Monetarist Welfare policy, guided by the economy. This Thatcherite consensus was characterised by policies such as Privatisation, driven by her belief in Individualism and Competition. Therefore, her main focus was to attempt to control public spending, privatisation, targeting and rising inequality, so much of the 1980s was focused on cutting public spending in the UK.

Policies differ in different regions of the United Kingdom, but the provision of a welfare state is still a basic principle of government policy in the United Kingdom today. The principle of health care &quot;free at the point of use&quot; became a central idea of the welfare state, which later Conservative governments, although critical of some aspects of the welfare state, did not reverse.

Welfare spending on poor people dropped by 25% under the United Kingdom government austerity programme of 2010 - 2019, cuts to benefits that disabled people receive were significant, Personal Independence Payments and Employment and Support Allowance have both dropped by 10%. Over half of families living below the breadline have at least one relative with a disability. Cuts include, tax credits (£4.6bn), universal credit (£3.6bn), child benefit (£3.4bn), disability benefits (£2.8bn), Employment and Support Allowance and Incapacity Benefit (£2bn) and housing benefit (£2.3bn). Frank Field said, &quot;A £37bn attack has been mounted on the living standards of many of our fellow citizens to such an extent that possibly millions struggle to keep on top of their rent, pay the bills and buy adequate food. Likewise, an unknown number are unable to clothe their children properly before sending them to school where all too many of these children not only rely on free school dinners as a cornerstone of their diet, but on breakfast and supper clubs as well.&quot;

==Expenditure==
In the financial year 2014/15, state pensions were overwhelmingly the largest governmental welfare expense, costing £86,500,000,000 followed by housing benefit, which accounted for over £20,000,000,000 Expenditure in 2015–16 on benefits included: £2,300,000,000 paid to unemployed people and £27,100,000,000 to people on low incomes, and £27,600,000,000 for personal tax credits.

In 2023/24, it is expected that government health spending, which is the biggest element of public spending, will reach £176,200,000,000. Other welfare expenses include education, which is predicted to reached £81,400,000,000, and state pensions, for which expenditure will be £124,300,000,000.
==Criticisms==

Conservative thinkers have debated the structural incompatibility between liberal principles and welfare state principles. Certain sectors of society have argued that the welfare state creates a disincentive for working and investment. Also suggesting that the welfare state at times does not eliminate the causes of individual contingencies and needs. Economically, the net losers of the welfare state are often more against its values and role within society.

In 2010, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government led by David Cameron argued for a reduction of welfare spending in the United Kingdom as part of their programme of austerity. Government ministers have argued that a growing culture of welfare dependency is perpetuating welfare spending, and claim that a cultural change is required to reduce the welfare bill. Public opinion in the UK appears to support a reduction in welfare spending, however commentators have suggested that negative public perceptions are founded on exaggerated assumptions about the proportion of spending on unemployment benefit and the level of benefit fraud.

Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show that benefit fraud is thought to have cost taxpayers £1.2 billion during 2012–13, up 9% on the year before. This was lower than the £1.5 billion of benefit underpayment due to error.

In some cases, relatives who bring up a child when the parents cannot bring up the child face sanctions and financial penalties, they can be left poor and homeless. There are also widespread complaints from church groups and others that the UK welfare state does insufficient work to prevent poverty, deprivation and even hunger. In 2018, food bank usage in the UK reached its highest point on record, with the UK&#x27;s main food bank provider, The Trussell Trust, stating that welfare benefits do not cover basic living costs. The Trussell Trust&#x27;s figures showed that 1,332,952 three-day emergency food supplies were delivered to people from March 2017 to March 2018. This represented a 13% increase from the previous year.

In 2018 support for raising taxes to finance more provision on health, education and social benefits was the highest it had been since 2002 according to NatCen Social Research. Two-thirds of Labour supporters favoured tax rises and 53% of Conservatives also favoured that.

In 2018 the House of Commons library estimated that by 2021, £37bn less would be spent on working-age social security than in 2010. Cuts to disability benefits, Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and employment and support allowance (ESA) are noteworthy, they will have fallen by 10%, since 2010. Over half of families with income below the breadline include at least one person with a disability. There are also cuts to tax credits Universal Credit child benefit disability benefits ESA and incapacity benefit and housing benefit. Alison Garnham of the Child Poverty Action Group said, &quot;Cuts and freezes have taken family budgets to the bone as costs rise and there is more pain to come as the two-child limit for tax credits and universal credit, the bedroom tax, the benefit cap and the rollout of universal credit push families deeper into poverty.&quot;

Social security payments in 2019 were the lowest they had been since the welfare state was started and food bank use had increased. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) found £73 per week, (which is standard for Universal Credit that 2.3 million people claim) amounted to 12.5% of median earnings. When unemployment benefit was introduced in 1948 it amounted to 20%. Millions of people in 2019 were &quot;excluded from mainstream society, with the basic goods and amenities needed to survive let alone thrive increasingly out of their grip&quot;. The IPPR urged all parties to add an emergency £8.4bn into the welfare system, which has become harder than previous systems because debt deductions are made from payments, there is increasing underpayment and strict sanctions are applied. One in three universal credit claimants are working.

Numerous negative consequences have been attributed to benefit sanctions imposed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the UK Government department that runs the welfare state in the UK. These include &quot;increased debt and rent arrears, food poverty, crime and worsening physical and mental health. Statistics indicate that in the period of 2011 to 2015 benefit sanctions on people with mental health problems increased by 668%. 19,259 people with mental health problems had benefits stopped in the period of 2014 to 2015, compared to 2,507 people in the period of 2011 to 2012. In 2020, the UK Government admitted that it had made no assessment of the impact that benefit sanctions made on mental health. At the same point in time the Government also refused to assess the impact benefit sanctions have on people&#x27;s mental health, which came after repeated warnings on the long-term damage they can cause to people that use the welfare state and to these people&#x27;s families. Also in 2020, it was reported that at least 69 suicides were linked to the DWP&#x27;s handling of benefit claims. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the actual number of deaths linked to claims could be much higher than this. It was also reported that the DWP were not looking into information from coroners or families, nor investigating all the reports of suicide made aware to it. In the same year the DWP were accused of a &quot;cover-up&quot; due to destroying approximately 50 reports connected to benefits being stopped. Officials blamed data protection laws for the actions, though the data watchdog denied there was any requirement to destroy the documents by any date. In March 2022, an academic study into whether benefit sanctions are linked to claimant ill-health, including mental illness and suicide was stopped after the DWP and Government ministers refused to release their recorded data on sanctions.
From a contemporary perspective, in practice, social welfare in the United Kingdom is very different from the ideal version of the welfare state that people may carry. Coverage is extensive, but benefits and services are delivered at a low level. The social protection provided is patchy, and services are tightly rationed.&quot; This opinion appears to be growing in popularity amongst the general population of the UK. This argument does stand when you compare certain statistics with some of Europe&#x27;s biggest nations. The UK has a tax revenue, as a share of GDP percentage of 12.55%... this is in this is simply incomparable when matched with France&#x27;s (57%), Germany&#x27;s (66.66%), and Italy&#x27;s (75%). It was also found, in a 2021 study by The Health Foundation, that Britain spends the 6th most money on health care amongst &quot;developed countries.&quot; This figure sits below the EU average and explains why some believe the welfare state is not so successful. It is also a fact that &quot;The UK dedicates roughly one-fifth of its GDP to social spending. That places us 17th – roughly in the middle – of OECD countries&quot; (Whiteford, 2022).

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that there was a distinct shortage of provisions available to support public health, including a lack of beds in the NHS and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). In the closing statement of the British Medical Association (BMA) in July 2023, it was noted that this lack of pandemic preparedness manifested in four key areas; failure to protect healthcare workers, lack of capacity and resources, failings of the test and trace system, and failings in government structures and processes. The statement also claimed that the &quot;UK was bottom of the table on numbers of doctors, nurses, beds, intensive care units, respirators and ventilators&quot;, and that funding of healthcare has been inadequate since 2010, suggesting that the state the NHS found itself in at the outbreak of the pandemic had not been an overnight shift, but rather the effect of the past decade&#x27;s funding issues.

The UK has seen a drastic increase in the usage of foodbanks nationwide: 2.17m food bank users in 2021/22 in comparison to the 41,000 in 2009/10. During the COVID-19 crisis, food insecurity impacted 16% of the population, and some critics argue that government food aid was instigated too late for the elderly and vulnerable. There have also been criticisms of the food parcels given, as reports stated that the parcels lacked nutritional food and instead contained an abundance of processed foods.

<doc id="217717" wikidata="Q1075685" url="?curid=217717" title="Carbon-burning process">
<text>The carbon-burning process or carbon fusion is a set of nuclear fusion reactions that take place in the cores of massive stars (at least 4 formula_1 at birth) that combines carbon into other elements. It requires high temperatures (&gt; 5×108 K or 50 keV) and densities (&gt; 3×109 kg/m3).

These figures for temperature and density are only a guide. More massive stars burn their nuclear fuel more quickly, since they have to offset greater gravitational forces to stay in (approximate) hydrostatic equilibrium. That generally means higher temperatures, although lower densities, than for less massive stars. To get the right figures for a particular mass, and a particular stage of evolution, it is necessary to use a numerical stellar model computed with computer algorithms. Such models are continually being refined based on nuclear physics experiments (which measure nuclear reaction rates) and astronomical observations (which include direct observation of mass loss, detection of nuclear products from spectrum observations after convection zones develop from the surface to fusion-burning regions – known as dredge-up events – and so bring nuclear products to the surface, and many other observations relevant to models).

==Fusion reactions==
The principal reactions are:

==Reaction products==
This sequence of reactions can be understood by thinking of the two interacting carbon nuclei as coming together to form an excited state of the 24Mg nucleus, which then decays in one of the five ways listed above. The first two reactions are strongly exothermic, as indicated by the large positive energies released, and are the most frequent results of the interaction. The third reaction is strongly endothermic, as indicated by the large negative energy indicating that energy is absorbed rather than emitted. This makes it much less likely, yet still possible in the high-energy environment of carbon burning. But the production of a few neutrons by this reaction is important, since these neutrons can combine with heavy nuclei, present in tiny amounts in most stars, to form even heavier isotopes in the s-process.

The fourth reaction might be expected to be the most common from its large energy release, but in fact it is extremely improbable because it proceeds via electromagnetic interaction, as it produces a gamma ray photon, rather than utilising the strong force between nucleons as do the first two reactions. Nucleons look a lot bigger to each other than they do to photons of this energy. However, the 24Mg produced in this reaction is the only magnesium left in the core when the carbon-burning process ends, as 23Mg is radioactive.

The last reaction is also very unlikely since it involves three reaction products, as well as being endothermic — think of the reaction proceeding in reverse, it would require the three products all to converge at the same time, which is less likely than two-body interactions.

The protons produced by the second reaction can take part in the proton–proton chain reaction, or the CNO cycle, but they can also be captured by 23Na to form 20Ne plus a 4He nucleus. In fact, a significant fraction of the 23Na produced by the second reaction gets used up this way. In stars between 4 and 11 solar masses, the 16O already produced by helium fusion in the previous stage of stellar evolution manages to survive the carbon-burning process pretty well, despite some of it being used up by capturing 4He nuclei. So the result of carbon burning is a mixture mainly of oxygen, neon, sodium and magnesium.

The fact that the mass-energy sum of the two carbon nuclei is similar to that of an excited state of the magnesium nucleus is known as &#x27;resonance&#x27;. Without this resonance, carbon burning would only occur at temperatures one hundred times higher. 
The experimental and theoretical investigation of such resonances is still a subject of research. A similar resonance increases the probability of the triple-alpha process, which is responsible for the original production of carbon.

==Neutrino losses==
Neutrino losses start to become a major factor in the fusion processes in stars at the temperatures and densities of carbon burning. Though the main reactions don&#x27;t involve neutrinos, the side reactions such as the proton–proton chain reaction do. But the main source of neutrinos at these high temperatures involves a process in quantum theory known as pair production. A high energy gamma ray which has a greater energy than the rest mass of two electrons (mass-energy equivalence) can interact with electromagnetic fields of the atomic nuclei in the star, and become a particle and anti-particle pair of an electron and positron.

Normally, the positron quickly annihilates with another electron, producing two photons, and this process can be safely ignored at lower temperatures. But around 1 in 1019 pair productions end with a weak interaction of the electron and positron, which replaces them with a neutrino and anti-neutrino pair. Since they move at virtually the speed of light and interact very weakly with matter, these neutrino particles usually escape the star without interacting, carrying away their mass-energy. This energy loss is comparable to the energy output from the carbon fusion.

Neutrino losses, by this and similar processes, play an increasingly important part in the evolution of the most massive stars. They force the star to burn its fuel at a higher temperature to offset them. Fusion processes are very sensitive to temperature so the star can produce more energy to retain hydrostatic equilibrium, at the cost of burning through successive nuclear fuels ever more rapidly. Fusion produces less energy per unit mass as the fuel nuclei get heavier, and the core of the star contracts and heats up when switching from one fuel to the next, so both these processes also significantly reduce the lifetime of each successive fusion-burning fuel.

Up to the helium burning stage the neutrino losses are negligible. But from the carbon burning stage onwards, the reduction in stellar lifetime due to energy lost in the form of neutrinos roughly matches the increased energy production due to fuel change and core contraction. In successive fuel changes in the most massive stars, the reduction in lifetime is dominated by the neutrino losses. For example, a star of 25 solar masses burns hydrogen in the core for 107 years, helium for 106 years and carbon for only 103 years.

==Stellar evolution==

During helium fusion, stars build up an inert core rich in carbon and oxygen. The inert core eventually reaches sufficient mass to collapse due to gravitation, whilst the helium burning moves gradually outward. This decrease in the inert core volume raises the temperature to the carbon ignition temperature. This will raise the temperature around the core and allow helium to burn in a shell around the core. Outside this is another shell burning hydrogen. The resulting carbon burning provides energy from the core to restore the star&#x27;s mechanical equilibrium. However, the balance is only short-lived; in a star of 25 solar masses, the process will use up most of the carbon in the core in only 600 years. The duration of this process varies significantly depending on the mass of the star.

Stars of below 4 solar masses never reach high enough core temperature to burn carbon, instead ending their lives as carbon-oxygen white dwarfs after shell helium flashes gently expel the outer envelope in a planetary nebula.

In stars with masses between 4 and 12 solar masses, the carbon-oxygen core is under degenerate conditions and carbon ignition takes place in a &quot;carbon flash&quot;, that lasts just milliseconds and disrupts the stellar core. In the late stages of this nuclear burning they develop a massive stellar wind, which quickly ejects the outer envelope in a planetary nebula leaving behind an O-Ne-Na-Mg white dwarf core of about 1.1 solar masses. The core never reaches high enough temperature for further fusion burning of heavier elements than carbon.

Stars of more than 12 solar masses start carbon burning in a non-degenerate core, and after carbon exhaustion proceed with the neon-burning process once contraction of the inert (O, Ne, Na, Mg) core raises the temperature sufficiently.

<doc id="217720" wikidata="Q1068896" url="?curid=217720" title="Oxygen-burning process">
<text>The oxygen-burning process is a set of nuclear fusion reactions that take place in massive stars that have used up the lighter elements in their cores. Oxygen-burning is preceded by the neon-burning process and succeeded by the silicon-burning process. As the neon-burning process ends, the core of the star contracts and heats until it reaches the ignition temperature for oxygen burning. Oxygen burning reactions are similar to those of carbon burning; however, they must occur at higher temperatures and densities due to the larger Coulomb barrier of oxygen.

==Reactions==
Oxygen ignites in the temperature range of (1.5–2.6)×109 K and in the density range of (2.6–6.7)×1012 kg·m−3. The principal reactions are given below, where the branching ratios assume that the deuteron channel is open (at high temperatures):

Near 2×109 K, the oxygen-burning reaction rate is approximately 2.8×10−12(&quot;T&quot;9/2)33, where &quot;T&quot;9 is the temperature in billion kelvins. Overall, the major products of the oxygen-burning process are 28Si, 32,33,34S, 35,37Cl, 36,38Ar, 39,41K, and 40,42Ca. Of these, 28Si and 32S constitute 90% of the final composition. The oxygen fuel within the core of the star is exhausted after 0.01–5 years, depending on the star&#x27;s mass and other parameters. The silicon-burning process, which follows, creates iron, but this iron cannot react further to create energy to support the star.

During the oxygen-burning process, proceeding outward, there is an oxygen-burning shell, followed by a neon shell, a carbon shell, a helium shell, and a hydrogen shell. The oxygen-burning process is the last nuclear reaction in the star&#x27;s core which does not proceed via the alpha process.

== Pre-oxygen burning ==
Although 16O is lighter than neon, neon burning occurs before oxygen burning, because 16O is a doubly-magic nucleus and hence extremely stable. Compared to oxygen, neon is much less stable. As a result, neon burning occurs at lower temperatures than 16O + 16O. During neon burning, oxygen and magnesium accumulate in the core of the star. At the onset of oxygen burning, oxygen in the stellar core is plentiful due to the helium-burning process (4He(2α,γ)12C(α,γ)16O), carbon-burning process (12C(12C,α)20Ne, 12C(α,γ)16O), and neon-burning process (20Ne(γ,α)16O). The reaction 12C(α,γ)16O has a significant effect on the reaction rates during oxygen burning, as it produces large quantities of 16O.

== Convectively bounded flames and off-center oxygen ignition ==
For stars with masses greater than 10.3 solar masses, oxygen ignites in the core or not at all. Similarly, for stars with a mass of less than 9 solar masses (without accretion of additional mass) oxygen ignites in the core or not at all. However, in the 9–10.3 solar mass range, oxygen ignites off-center.

For stars in this mass range neon-burning occurs in a convective envelope rather than at the core of the star. For the particular example of a 9.5 solar mass star, the neon-burning process takes place in an envelope of approximately 0.252 solar masses (~1560 kilometers) off center. From the ignition flash, the neon convective zone extends further out to 1.1 solar masses with a peak power around 1036 W. After only a month, the power declines to about 1035 W and stays at this rate for about 10 years. After this phase, the neon in the shell is depleted, resulting in greater inward pressure on the star. This raises the shell&#x27;s temperature to 1.65 billion kelvins. This results in a neon-burning, convectively-bound flame front that moves toward the core. The motion of the flame is what eventually leads to oxygen-burning. In approximately 3 years, the flame&#x27;s temperature reaches about 1.83 billion kelvins, enabling the oxygen-burning process to commence. This occurs around 9.5 years before the iron core develops. Similarly to the beginning of neon-burning, off-center oxygen-burning commences with another flash. The convectively burning flame then results from both neon and oxygen burning as it advances towards the core, while the oxygen-burning shell continuously shrinks in mass.

== Neutrino losses ==
During the oxygen-burning process, energy loss due to neutrino emission becomes relevant. Due to the large energy loss, oxygen must burn at temperatures higher than a billion kelvins in order to maintain a radiation pressure strong enough to support the star against gravity. Further, (which produce neutrinos) become significant when the matter density is high enough (ρ &gt; 2×107 g/cm3). Due to these factors, the timescale of oxygen burning is much shorter for heavy, dense stars.

== Explosive oxygen burning ==
The oxygen-burning process can occur under hydrostatic and under explosive conditions. The products of explosive oxygen burning are similar to those in hydrostatic oxygen burning. However, stable oxygen burning is accompanied by a multitude of electron captures, while explosive oxygen burning is accompanied by a significantly greater presence of photodisintegration reactions. In the temperature range of (3–4)×109 K, photodisintegration and oxygen fusion occur with comparable reaction rates.

== Pair-instability supernovae ==
Very massive (140–260 solar masses) population III stars may become unstable during core oxygen burning due to pair production. This results in a thermonuclear explosion, which completely disrupts the star.

<text>Joan Mary Cusack (; born October 11, 1962) is an American actress. She received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her roles in the comedy-drama &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988) and the romantic comedy &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997). Her other starring roles include those in &quot;Toys&quot; (1992), &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995), &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999), &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (2000), &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003), &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), and &quot;Kit Kittredge: An American Girl&quot; (2008). She has also provided the voice of Jessie in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise (1999–present), for which she won an Annie Award, and Abby Mallard in &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005).

Cusack was a cast member on the comedy sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1985 to 1986. She starred on the Showtime hit drama/comedy series &quot;Shameless&quot; (2011–2021) as Sheila Jackson, a role for which she received five consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning for the first time in 2015. She is the sister of actress Ann Cusack and actor John Cusack.

==Early life==

Cusack was born on October 11, 1962, in New York City and was raised in Evanston, Illinois. Her mother, Ann Paula &quot;Nancy&quot; Cusack (&quot;née&quot; Carolan; 1929–2022), was a former mathematics teacher and political activist. Her father, Dick Cusack (1925–2003), was an actor and filmmaker, and two of her four siblings, Ann and John, are actors. Her family is of Irish Catholic descent. Cusack is an alumna of the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1984).

==Career==
Cusack has twice been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988) and &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997). She has appeared with her brother John in 10 movies: &quot;Class&quot; (1983), &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984), &quot;Grandview, U.S.A.&quot; (1984), &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987), &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997), &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999), &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (2000), &quot;Martian Child&quot; (2007), and &quot;War, Inc.&quot; (2008).

In the film &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), she played psychotic serial killer Debbie Jellinsky, who marries and kills rich men. She also starred in the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;What About Joan?&quot; in 2001 and the hit film &quot;Arlington Road&quot; (1999). For many years, Cusack was also the commercial spokeswoman for U.S. Cellular. One of Cusack&#x27;s most well-known roles was the principal of Horace Green Elementary School, Rosalie &#x27;Roz&#x27; Mullins, in &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003). She also voiced Jessie in the Pixar hits &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019), and played Dr. Burton, the therapist of Charlie (Logan Lerman), in the teen film &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; (2012). She also played Erin&#x27;s mom in the final episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot;.

Cusack was a cast member on the NBC sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1985 to 1986. Her recurring characters on &quot;SNL&quot; included Salena, a socially inept girl who tries to ask out her boyfriend, Biff (played by Jon Lovitz), who is also socially inept. In addition, she did celebrity impersonations of Brooke Shields, Jane Fonda, and Queen Elizabeth II.

She has been nominated four times for the American Comedy Award in the category of Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture and has won three times, for &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (1999), &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), and &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988). She has also won the New York Film Critics Circle Award and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;.

Cusack narrates the public-TV animated series &quot;Peep and the Big Wide World&quot;. In September 2010, Cusack guest-starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;.

She also appeared as Justice Strauss in Netflix&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, which premiered in 2017.

Cusack also appeared as the Tin Foil Lady in the Netflix movie &quot;Let It Snow&quot;, which was released in November 2019.

===&quot;Shameless&quot;===
In 2010, Cusack joined the Showtime drama/comedy &quot;Shameless&quot; as Sheila Jackson, the mother of Karen Jackson (Laura Slade Wiggins). The first season premiered on January 9, 2011, and had its first finale March 27, 2011. Cusack replaced actress Allison Janney, who portrayed the role in the first edit of the pilot episode. Janney took the role with the understanding the character would be less prominent on the show, but when producers decided to increase the character&#x27;s screen presence, she was forced to pull out of the part to honor her series commitment on the ABC comedy &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;. Cusack has received critical acclaim for her performance, receiving Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series nominations in 2011, 2012, and 2013, as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2014 and 2015, winning in the later year.

==Personal life==
Cusack married attorney Richard Burke, President and CEO of Envoy Global, Inc. in 1996. They have two sons: Dylan John and Miles. She discovered she was pregnant with her first child on her first day of shooting the movie &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot; (1996). Cusack owns a home in Three Oaks Township, Michigan, and lives in Chicago, Illinois.

Since 2011, Cusack has owned Judy Maxwell Home, a gift shop in Old Town, Chicago. The shop is named for Barbra Streisand&#x27;s character in &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot;, Cusack&#x27;s favorite movie.

<doc id="217726" wikidata="Q258580" url="?curid=217726" title="Silicon-burning process">
<text>In astrophysics, silicon burning is a very brief sequence of nuclear fusion reactions that occur in massive stars with a minimum of about 8–11 solar masses. Silicon burning is the final stage of fusion for massive stars that have run out of the fuels that power them for their long lives in the &quot;main sequence&quot; on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. It follows the previous stages of hydrogen, helium, carbon, neon and oxygen burning processes.

Silicon burning begins when gravitational contraction raises the star&#x27;s core temperature to 2.7–3.5 billion kelvins (GK). The exact temperature depends on mass. When a star has completed the silicon-burning phase, no further fusion is possible. The star catastrophically collapses and may explode in what is known as a Type II supernova.

==Nuclear fusion sequence and silicon photodisintegration==

After a star completes the oxygen-burning process, its core is composed primarily of silicon and sulfur. If it has sufficiently high mass, it further contracts until its core reaches temperatures in the range of 2.7–3.5 GK (230–300 keV). At these temperatures, silicon and other elements can photodisintegrate, emitting a proton or an alpha particle. Silicon burning proceeds by photodisintegration rearrangement, which creates new elements by the alpha process, adding one of these freed alpha particles (the equivalent of a helium nucleus) per capture step in the following sequence (photoejection of alphas not shown):

The chain could theoretically continue, as adding further alphas continues to be exothermic all the way to tin-100. However, the steps after nickel-56 are much less exothermic and the temperature is so high that photodisintegration prevents further progress.

The silicon-burning sequence lasts about one day before being struck by the shock wave that was launched by the core collapse. Burning then becomes much more rapid at the elevated temperature and stops only when the rearrangement chain has been converted to nickel-56 or is stopped by supernova ejection and cooling. The nickel-56 decays first to cobalt-56 and then to iron-56, with half-lives of 6 and 77 days respectively, but this happens later, because only minutes are available within the core of a massive star. The star has run out of nuclear fuel and within minutes its core begins to contract.

During this phase of the contraction, the potential energy of gravitational contraction heats the interior to 5 GK (430 keV) and this opposes and delays the contraction. However, since no additional heat energy can be generated via new fusion reactions, the final unopposed contraction rapidly accelerates into a collapse lasting only a few seconds. The central portion of the star is now crushed into a neutron core with the temperature soaring further to 100 GK (8.6 MeV) that quickly cools down into a neutron star if the mass of the star is below . Between and , fallback of the material will make the neutron core collapse further into a black hole. The outer layers of the star are blown off in an explosion known as a Type II supernova that lasts days to months. The supernova explosion releases a large burst of neutrons, which may synthesize in about one second roughly half of the supply of elements in the universe that are heavier than iron, via a rapid neutron-capture sequence known as the &quot;r&quot;-process (where the &quot;r&quot; stands for &quot;rapid&quot; neutron capture).

==Binding energy==
This graph shows the binding energy per nucleon of various nuclides. The binding energy is the difference between the energy of free protons and neutrons and the energy of the nuclide. If the product or products of a reaction have higher binding energy per nucleon than the reactant or reactants, then the reaction is exothermic (releases energy) and can go forward, though this is valid only for reactions that do not change the number of protons or neutrons (no weak force reactions). As can be seen, light nuclides such as deuterium or helium release large amounts of energy (a big increase in binding energy) when combined to form heavier elements—the process of fusion. Conversely, heavy elements such as uranium release energy when broken into lighter elements—the process of nuclear fission. In stars, rapid nucleosynthesis proceeds by adding helium nuclei (alpha particles) to heavier nuclei. As mentioned above, this process ends around atomic mass 56. Decay of nickel-56 explains the large amount of iron-56 seen in metallic meteorites and the cores of rocky planets.

<text>Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club ( ), commonly referred to as Wolves, is a professional football club based in Wolverhampton, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club has played at Molineux Stadium since moving from Dudley Road in 1889. The club&#x27;s traditional kit consists of old gold shirts and socks with black shorts. Since 1979, the kit has also featured the club&#x27;s &quot;wolf&#x27;s head&quot; logo. Long-standing rivalries exist with other clubs from the West Midlands, including Aston Villa, and Birmingham City but the main one being the Black Country derby contested with West Bromwich Albion. Since 2016, the club has been owned by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun International.

Formed as &quot;St. Luke&#x27;s F.C.&quot; in 1877, the club changed name to Wolverhampton Wanderers two years later and became one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1893, and again as a Second Division team in 1908 following the club&#x27;s relegation two years previously. They fell to the third tier in 1923, but went on to win the Third Division North in 1923–24 and the Second Division in 1931–32. The team was crowned English League champions three times – in 1953–54, 1957–58 and 1958–59 – all under the management of Stan Cullis. Wolves also won another two FA Cup finals, in 1949 and 1960. Relegated in 1965, after 26 consecutive seasons in the top flight, they secured promotion back to the First Division in 1966–67. Wolves won the League Cup in 1974 and 1980, and again won the Second Division title in 1976–77.

Wolves suffered a financial crisis during the early-1980s recession that led to the club coming close to liquidation in 1982. In the five seasons between 1981–82 and 1985–86 Wolves were relegated four times (although there was also one promotion in 1982–83), meaning the club ended up in what was then the Football League Fourth Division (now EFL League Two) for the first (and so far only) time in the club&#x27;s history. However, the club immediately started a swift turn-around, and having been beaten in the inaugural Football League play-off final in 1987, Wolves won the Fourth Division and Football League Trophy titles in 1987–88, followed by the Third Division title in 1988–89.

After fourteen seasons in the second tier between 1989 and 2003, Wolves reached the Premier League, founded in 1992, for the first time with victory in the 2003 play-offs, though they were relegated after a single season in the top division on this occasion. Wolves won the Championship in 2008–09 to return to the Premier League, but endured relegation in 2011–12, followed by relegation again (to EFL League One) in 2012–13. The club then returned to the Premier League after first winning the League One title in 2013–14, followed by another Championship title in 2017–18.

After becoming one of the first British clubs to install floodlights at its home ground in 1953, Wolves arranged televised &quot;floodlit friendlies&quot; against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956, which were instrumental in the launch of the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League) in 1955. Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the competition in 1959–60 as well as the semi-finals of the 1960–61 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the inaugural UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Following a 39-year absence from UEFA competitions, they reached the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals in 2020.

==History==

===Formation and the Football League (1879–1893)===
In the 2000 edition of &quot;The Rough Guide to English Football&quot;, the history section on the Wolves page begins: &quot;The very name Wolves thunders from the pages of English football history&quot;. As with several other clubs, Everton for example, Wolves had humble beginnings shaped by the twin influences of cricket and the church. The club was founded in 1877 as St. Luke&#x27;s F.C. by John Baynton and John Brodie, two pupils of St Luke&#x27;s Church School in Blakenhall, who had been presented with a football by their headmaster Harry Barcroft. The team played its first game on 13 January 1877 against a reserve side from Stafford Road, later merging with the football section of a local cricket club called Blakenhall Wanderers to form Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 1879. Having initially played on two strips of land in the town, they relocated to a more substantial venue on Dudley Road in 1881, before lifting their first trophy in 1884 when they won the Wrekin Cup, during a season in which they played their first FA Cup tie. Having become professional, the club were nominated to become one of the twelve founder members of the Football League in 1888, in which they played in the first round of Football League fixtures ever staged, against Aston Villa on 8 September 1888. They ended the inaugural season in third place, as well as reaching their first FA Cup Final, losing 0–3 to the first &quot;Double&quot; winners, Preston North End. At the conclusion of the campaign the club relocated for a final time when they moved to Molineux, then a pleasure park known as the Molineux Grounds.

===FA Cup success and world war years (1893–1950)===
Wolves lifted the FA Cup for the first time in 1893 when they beat Everton 1–0, and made a third FA Cup Final appearance in 1896. The club added a second FA Cup Final triumph (a 3–1 win against Newcastle United) to their 1893 success in 1908, two years after having dropped into the Second Division for the first time. After struggling during the years either side of the First World War to regain their place in the top division (a period that was punctuated by another FA Cup Final appearance in 1921), the club suffered a further relegation in 1923, entering the Third Division (North), which they won at the first attempt. Eight years after returning to the Second Division, Wolves regained their top-flight status as Second Division Champions under Major Frank Buckley after twenty-six years away. With Buckley at the helm the team became established as one of the leading club sides in England in the years leading up to the Second World War, as they finished runners-up in the league twice in succession (1937–38 &amp; 1938–39), as well as reaching the last pre-war FA Cup Final, in which they suffered a shock defeat to Portsmouth. In 1937–38 Wolves came within a whisker of winning the club&#x27;s first English league title: a win in the side&#x27;s last game away to Sunderland would have clinched things, but in the event Wolves lost 0–1 and thus ended the campaign one point behind the eventual champions, Arsenal. One of the things Major Buckley and his Wolves side attracted a lot of attention for in the last two full seasons prior to the suspension of league football during the Second World War was Buckley&#x27;s insistence that his players be injected with monkey gland extract to enhance their stamina and performance, a practice that the Football League disapproved of but did not prohibit.

When league football resumed after the Second World War, Wolves suffered yet another final day failure in the First Division. Just as in 1938, victory in their last match would have won the title but a 2–1 loss to title rivals Liverpool meant that Liverpool were crowned champions instead. This game had been the last in a Wolves shirt for Stan Cullis, and a year later he became manager of the club. In Cullis&#x27;s first season in charge, he led Wolves to a first major honour in 41 years as they beat Leicester City to lift the FA Cup, and a year later, only goal average prevented Wolves winning the league title.

===The Stan Cullis era (1950–1960)===
The 1950s were by far the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history. Captained by Billy Wright, Wolves finally claimed the league championship for the first time in 1953–54, overhauling local rivals West Bromwich Albion late in the season. Two further titles were soon won in successive years (1957–58 and 1958–59), as Wolves vied with Manchester United to be acknowledged the premier team in English football at that juncture. Wolves were renowned both for the club&#x27;s domestic success and for the staging of high-profile &quot;floodlit friendlies&quot; against other top club sides from around the world. Wolves had become one of the first club sides in Britain to invest in floodlighting in 1953 at a cost of £10,000 (£281,308.64 at 2019 prices). Perhaps the most famed of these friendlies saw Wolves defeat a Honvéd side including many members of the Hungarian national team that had recently humbled England twice, leading the national media to proclaim Wolves &quot;Champions of the World&quot;. This became the final spur for Gabriel Hanot, the editor of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, to propose the creation of the European Cup (later rebranded as the UEFA Champions League). Wolves were one of the first British clubs to participate. In the 1957–58 season, Wolves defeated Real Madrid 5–4 (3–2 in Wolverhampton and 2–2 in Madrid) in home and away friendlies.

===Cup success in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s (1960–1980)===
The 1960s began with a fourth FA Cup victory and Wolves almost achieved the first League and FA Cup &#x27;double&#x27; of the 20th century in English football. They were pipped to the league title by a point on the final day of the season by Burnley. Despite that bright start to the decade, the 1960s saw Wolves begin to decline. After finishing as league runners-up in 1959–60 and a creditable third-place league finish in Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s &#x27;double&#x27;-winning season, the team faded and Cullis himself was dismissed after sixteen years in post in September 1964 after a disastrous start to the 1964–65 season. Cullis&#x27;s dismissal did not prevent the season ending with relegation (the first time Wolves had known relegation since 1922–23) and the club&#x27;s first spell outside the top division since 1932. Exile from the top flight lasted only two seasons however, as Wolves were promoted in 1967 as Second Division runners-up.

During the close season in 1967, Wolves played a mini-season in North America as part of the fledgling United Soccer Association league which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Playing as the &quot;Los Angeles Wolves&quot;, they won the Western Division and ultimately the championship by defeating the Eastern Division champions Washington Whips (import of Aberdeen) in a final decider.

The club&#x27;s return to the English top flight in 1967 heralded another period of relative success under Bill McGarry, with a fourth place league finish in 1971 qualifying Wolves for the newly created UEFA Cup. En route to the UEFA Cup final, they defeated Juventus and Ferencváros before losing to Tottenham Hotspur 3–2 on aggregate; a 2–1 home defeat in the first leg proving decisive. Wolves lifted silverware two years later when they won the League Cup for the first time by beating Manchester City 2–1 in the final. Despite relegation again in 1976, Wolves bounced back at the first attempt as Second Division champions under manager Sammy Chung, and then under manager John Barnwell, the turn of the decade saw them finish in the top six in the league and win the 1980 League Cup, when then-record signing Andy Gray scored the only goal of the final to defeat the reigning European champions and League Cup holders Nottingham Forest.

===Financial crisis, decline and recovery (1980–1990)===
The multi-million pound rebuilding of the Molineux Street Stand in 1979 was to be the catalyst for the club&#x27;s near-financial ruin during the next decade. Plunging match attendances in the early-1980s, at least partly due to recession in both the national and local economies, and consequent difficulties in repaying the loans taken out to fund the new John Ireland Stand, led the club to receivership and relegation in 1982. The club was saved from liquidation at the last minute when it was purchased by a consortium fronted by former player Derek Dougan. Initially this takeover, financed by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties, brought immediate promotion back to the First Division under manager Graham Hawkins, but the Bhattis&#x27; failure to invest sufficiently in the club soon saw things unravel as the team suffered three consecutive relegations through the football divisions under different managers, as well as the almost-constant threat of the club being wound-up.

In 1986, with the club again in receivership, a deal saw Wolverhampton City Council purchase the stadium and surrounding land, while a local developer paid off the club&#x27;s outstanding debts in return for planning permission to develop the land adjacent to the stadium. The 1986–87 season saw Wolves&#x27; first campaign in the Fourth Division, where, with the guidance of new manager Graham Turner and the goals of Steve Bull, who would ultimately score a club record 306 goals, the team reached the final of the inaugural play-offs but were denied promotion by Aldershot. Building on that, the team achieved both the Fourth and Third Division championships in the next two seasons and won the 1988 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley.

===The Hayward years (1990–2007)===
Lifelong fan Jack Hayward purchased the club in 1990 and immediately funded the extensive redevelopment of a by then dilapidated Molineux into a modern all-seater stadium. With work completed in 1993, Hayward redirected his investment onto the playing side in an attempt to win promotion to the newly formed Premier League. Despite substantial spending, neither Graham Taylor nor Mark McGhee could fulfil this, both managers leading the team to play-off defeats at the semi-final stages in 1995 and 1997 respectively. It was not until 2003 that Wolves were promoted, when they defeated Sheffield United 3–0 in the play-off final under Dave Jones to end a 19-year absence from the top level. Their stay proved short-lived however as they were immediately relegated back to the newly retitled EFL Championship.

===Promotion, relegations and turbulent times (2007–2016)===
After former England manager Glenn Hoddle failed to bring a swift return to the Premier League, the rebuilding of the squad by Mick McCarthy rejuvenated the club with an unexpected play-off finish. The club was bought from Sir Jack Hayward by Steve Morgan in 2007 and two years later the team returned to the Premier League as 2008–09 Football League Championship title winners. Wolves successfully battled relegation for two seasons before McCarthy&#x27;s dismissal in the 2011–12 season, which precipitated relegation under his former assistant Terry Connor, who was promoted to replace McCarthy.

Following relegation, Norwegian Ståle Solbakken became the club&#x27;s first overseas manager but his tenure lasted only six months before a poor run of results saw him replaced by Dean Saunders in January 2013. Saunders failed to bring any upturn, culminating in both the club&#x27;s relegation to EFL League One, a level the club had not played at since 1989, and Saunders&#x27;s own dismissal. Following this, Kenny Jackett was appointed in May 2013 in the retitled position of head coach, and led the team back to the EFL Championship in his first season, setting a new club record points total of 103 which is also an all-time record for the most points accumulated by any team during a Tier 3 season.

===Fosun era: Return to the Premier League and continental football (2016–present)===
On 21 July 2016, Chinese investment group Fosun International bought the club&#x27;s parent company, W.W. (1990) Ltd, from Steve Morgan and his own company Bridgemere Group for a reported £45 million, with Jez Moxey stepping down from his role as a CEO and replaced by managing director Laurie Dalrymple. The new owners dismissed Kenny Jackett and brought in former Italian international Walter Zenga as head coach. Zenga was dismissed after just 14 league games and Paul Lambert appointed as his successor in November. At the end of the season, Lambert too was dismissed, with former FC Porto boss Nuno Espírito Santo replacing him. Under Nuno, Wolves won the 2017–18 EFL Championship title and returned to the Premier League after a six-year absence.

Wolverhampton Wanderers finished 7th on their return to the Premier League, their highest position in the top division since finishing 6th in 1979–80, earning a spot in the qualification rounds of the UEFA Europa League, thus invoking their first continental campaign since 1980–81. They lost to that season&#x27;s eventual winners Sevilla 0–1 in a modified single-leg quarter-final played in a neutral venue in Germany due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Wolves replicated their previous season&#x27;s 7th-place finish in the Premier League in 2019–20 but with two more points and only missed out on a return to continental competition, both on goal difference and Arsenal winning that season&#x27;s FA Cup.

In the 2020–21 season, Wolves lost striker Raúl Jiménez to a season-ending injury (a fractured skull) in November, and subsequently struggled for goals for the remainder of the campaign, finishing 13th. Espírito Santo left &quot;by mutual consent&quot;, and was replaced by former Benfica head coach Bruno Lage. In 2021–22, the club finished 10th. Wolves dismissed Lage on 2 October 2022 after eight games of the 2022–23 season with only one win and just three goals scored. Former Real Madrid, Spain and Sevilla manager Julen Lopetegui replaced him. Despite being in 20th place in the league before his first Premier League game, Lopetegui guided Wolves to a 13th-place finish. He left prior to the 2023–24 season due to a dispute over the transfer budget, and was replaced by Gary O&#x27;Neil. O&#x27;Neil was sacked in December 2024 with the club in 19th position and was replaced by Vítor Pereira on a contract lasting until June 2026. 

==Colours and badge==

The club&#x27;s traditional colours of gold and black allude to the city council&#x27;s motto &quot;out of darkness cometh light&quot; with the two colours representing light and darkness respectively. Although the team&#x27;s original colours upon formation were red and white, adopted from the school colours of St Lukes, for much of their history their home colours have been their distinctive old gold shirts with black shorts.

In the early decades of the club a variety of shirt designs using these colours were created, including stripes and diagonal halves, until the continual usage of a plain shirt design since the 1930s. Before the 1960s a darker shade of gold was used, known as &quot;old gold&quot;, which is still often cited in the media as the club&#x27;s colour.

Like most English teams, their earliest shirts usually only featured a badge on special occasions such as cup finals. The first such badge to be worn on Wolves shirts was the coat of arms of Wolverhampton City Council. In the late 1960s, Wolves introduced their own club badge that appeared on their shirts consisting of a single leaping wolf, which later became three leaping wolves in the mid-1970s. Since 1979 the badge has consisted of a single &quot;wolf head&quot; design; the current badge was last redesigned in 2002.

In May 2019, the club won a legal challenge by Peter Davies, a 71 year old retired building industry manager, who claimed he drew the wolf head motif as a schoolboy in the 1960s and entered it in an art competition. Mr Davies said he came up with the angular design after a teacher asked him to demonstrate an understanding of Blaise Pascal&#x27;s Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem, and entered it in an art competition advertised in the Express and Star newspaper. Mr Davies had made a copyright claim and wanted compensation. Mr Davies lost his copyright infringement claim and now faces legal fees and costs estimated to be about £450,000.

Wolves&#x27; traditional away colours have been all-white, but recent decades have seen a variety of colours used, including black, blue, teal, purple and maroon.

==Stadium==

===Former grounds===
When first founded the club used a field on Goldthorn Hill in the Blakenhall area as its home, which could accommodate some 2,000 spectators. In 1879 they relocated to John Harper&#x27;s Field on Lower Villiers Street where they remained for two years before a short move to Dudley Road, with the new ground situated opposite the Fighting Cocks Inn. It was here that they played their first FA Cup tie in 1883 and their first Football League fixture in September 1888. Although the site could only hold 2,500 spectators at first it was eventually developed to be capable of 10,000.

===Molineux===

In the summer of 1889 the club moved to its permanent home ever since, Molineux, in the Whitmore Reans area of the city. The stadium name originates from the Molineux House built in the area by Benjamin Molineux, a local merchant, in the 18th century and whose grounds were later developed to include numerous public leisure facilities. When the Northampton Brewery Company purchased these grounds in 1889, they rented their use to the city&#x27;s football club, who were seeking to find a home more befitting a Football League member. After renovating the site, the first ever official game was staged on 7 September 1889 before a crowd of 4,000. The ground was capable of hosting 20,000 spectators, although English football crowds rarely reached that number in the 19th century.

Wolves bought the freehold in 1923 and soon began a series of ground improvements under the auspices of Archibald Leitch, beginning with the construction of a major grandstand on the Waterloo Road side. In 1932, the club also built a new stand on the Molineux Street side and followed this by adding a roof to the South Bank two years later; this South Bank was historically the second largest of all Kop ends in the country and regularly held crowds in excess of 30,000. The stadium finally now had four complete stands that would form its basis for the next half-century.

In the days before seating regulations, the ground could hold more than 60,000 spectators, with the record attendance being 61,315 for a First Division match against Liverpool on 11 February 1939. The 1940s and 1950s saw average attendances for seasons regularly exceed 40,000, coinciding with the club&#x27;s peak on the field. During this time Molineux became one of the first British grounds to install floodlights, enabling it to host a series of midweek friendlies against teams from around the globe. In the days prior to the formation of the European Cup and international club competitions, these games were highly prestigious and gained huge crowds and interest with the BBC often televising such events.

When the Molineux Street Stand failed to meet new safety legislation, the club began building a new replacement stand behind the existing one on land where housing had been demolished. This new all-seater stand – named the John Ireland Stand after the then-club president – was completed in 1979 and was the first stage of a plan to rebuild the entire stadium. The cost of the Ireland Stand escalated to over £2 million and plunged the club into a financial crisis. As a result, it was forced to enter receivership in 1982. By the time the team dropped into the Fourth Division in 1986, only the John Ireland Stand and the South Bank terrace remained in use. New safety laws were implemented following the Bradford City stadium fire and these forced the closure of both the now-dilapidated North Bank and Waterloo Road Stand. The club did not have the funds necessary to rebuild them.

Following the takeover of the club by Sir Jack Hayward in 1990, £8.5 million of funding was made available to redevelop Molineux comprehensively. Between August 1991 and December 1993 three sides of the stadium were completely rebuilt to form a 28,525 capacity all-seater stadium that complied with the Taylor Report: the Waterloo Road Stand was replaced by the Billy Wright Stand, the North Bank terrace by the Stan Cullis Stand, and the South Bank terrace by the Sir Jack Hayward Stand (named the Jack Harris Stand until 2015). Aside from the addition of a temporary seating area in the southwest corner used during Wolves&#x27; seasons in the Premier League; this redevelopment formed the stadium for almost twenty years.

In 2010, plans were unveiled for an extensive redevelopment programme to enlarge the capacity and develop the facilities. The first stage of this saw a new two-tier Stan Cullis Stand become fully operational for the 2012–13 season, raising the current official capacity to 31,700. The proposed second stage concerned the rebuilding of the oldest stand at the stadium (built in 1979 as the John Ireland Stand and renamed the Steve Bull Stand in 2003) to increase capacity to around 36,000, but this and any further work was shelved when it became likely that the club would be relegated from the Premier League in 2012.

Ground redevelopments were once again placed on the agenda following the club&#x27;s acquisition by Fosun in 2016. In contrast to previously mooted plans, it was publicly revealed in February 2019 that future plans consisting of the demolition and full rebuild of the Steve Bull Stand, followed by the redevelopment of the Sir Jack Hayward Stand, to raise the stadium capacity to 45–46,000, were under active consideration. However, in 2020 the club announced more modest plans for making gradual improvements to the stadium as the club seeks to retain its unique character, and enable prioritisation of investment in the playing side of the club.

===Development squad and Academy===
Wolverhampton Wanderers Under-23s are competing in Division 2 of the Premier League 2 during the current season, following relegation from the highest level after the previous season was curtailed and decided on a point-per-game basis. The team qualifies as an entrant in Premier League 2 by virtue of Wolves&#x27;s academy holding Category 1 status. Although the league is designed for players aged 23 and below, three overage players may also feature. Home games are primarily staged at Kidderminster Harriers&#x27; Aggborough home.

===Wolves Women===

Originally founded in 1975, Wolves Women became the club&#x27;s official women&#x27;s team in 2008. They currently play at the third level of English women&#x27;s football in the FA Women&#x27;s National League North. Their home games are played at the New Bucks Head Ground in Telford.

The club has been represented by numerous high-profile players over the years, most notably Billy Wright, who captained England a record 90 times and was the first player to win a century of international caps, as well as earning the Footballer of the Year Award (in 1952), an accolade also won by Wolves half-back Bill Slater in 1960. In total, 36 players have won full England caps during their time with Wolves, including the club&#x27;s former captain Conor Coady as well as the club&#x27;s record goalscorer Steve Bull, who was the last of the club&#x27;s England internationals to play in a major tournament.

Andy Gray, Emlyn Hughes, Paul Ince and Denis Irwin are all previous League Championship medal winners who have also represented Wolves. Joleon Lescott went on to play for England 26 times scoring once. Robbie Keane went on to become Ireland&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer with 68 goals in 146 appearances.

===Managerial history===

Wolves have had 32 different (permanently appointed) managers during the club&#x27;s existence. The first manager, George Worrall, was identified by the title of &quot;club secretary&quot;, a post that continued until the appointment of a full-time manager in the modern sense was made in 1922.

The club&#x27;s most successful manager is Stan Cullis, whose 16-year tenure brought all three of Wolves&#x27; league championships as well as two FA Cup triumphs. Two other managers have been inducted into the Club Hall of Fame: Major Frank Buckley and Graham Turner. Turner oversaw two successive divisional championship wins in the late-1980s, winning the Fourth Division title in 1987-88 and the Third Division title the following season. Bill McGarry and John Barnwell both won the League Cup for Wolves in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the 21st century, Dave Jones, Mick McCarthy and Nuno Espírito Santo have led the club into the Premier League. Kenny Jackett took Wolves to a record EFL League One (Tier 3) points haul of 103 as they won this division in 2013–14.

Ståle Solbakken became Wolves’ first foreign manager under Steve Morgan’s ownership, followed later by Walter Zenga, two Portuguese managers Nuno Espírito Santo and Bruno Lage, and Julen Lopetegui who is Spanish, under current owners Fosun.

Wolves have also been managed by two former England national team managers in Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle.

==Support==
As well as having numerous supporters&#x27; clubs across the United Kingdom, Wolverhampton Wanderers also have an international support base, with supporters&#x27; clubs in Australia, United States, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Malta, Iceland and Norway amongst others. They have a particularly sizeable Scandinavian fanbase, due to the area&#x27;s television coverage of Midlands football in the 1970s when the club were a regular top-flight team; the first English match shown live in both Sweden and Norway involved Wolves (Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 Sunderland in the Football League First Division on Saturday, 29 November 1969).

===Rivalries===

Wolves&#x27; longest-established and strongest rivalry is with West Bromwich Albion, against whom the club contest the Black Country derby. The two clubs, separated by eleven miles, have faced each other 163 times; their first competitive clash being an FA Cup tie in 1886. A national survey by the football pools found the rivalry to be the strongest in English football. Both clubs are founder members of the Football League and the two once contested the league title in 1953–54, with Wolves finishing as champions.

Wolves also share rivalries with the two Birmingham clubs, Aston Villa and Birmingham City, against whom there have been numerous matches dating back to the 19th century. Wolves&#x27; closest geographic rival is actually Walsall but, as they have rarely competed at the same level, it is of less significance. As Wolverhampton historically sat within the boundaries of Staffordshire, a Staffordshire derby between Wolves and Stoke City is also recognised.

The 2018–19 Premier League season was the first and only time ever that Wolves were the sole representatives of the West Midlands in the top flight of English football. The 2020–21 Premier League season saw Wolves play against both Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion. Since Albion&#x27;s relegation at the end of that season, Aston Villa has been Wolves&#x27; only West Midlands rival in the Premier League.

===Fan culture===
During the club&#x27;s peak in the 1950s, the home crowd&#x27;s signature song was &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;, which was a chart hit in the U.K. in 1954 when Wolves first won the league title. In more recent times, &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot; – a 1967 rock song by Jeff Beck with its chorus modified to &quot;Hi Ho Wolverhampton!&quot; – has become a staple feature of home games. &quot;The Liquidator&quot; instrumental by the Harry J. Allstars was also popularly used in the stadium until a request from the West Midlands Police to cease due to concerns that the obscene lyrics used by some fans during the chorus could incite trouble.

The club attracted a number of hooligans in the 1960s. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a hooligan firm named &quot;The Subway Army&quot; would often ambush fans in the subway adjacent to the ground. The group was gradually broken up and virtually ceased to exist due to a large number of arrests – many as part of the police&#x27;s nationwide &quot;Operation GROWTH&quot; (or &quot;Get Rid of Wolverhampton&#x27;s Troublesome Hooligans&quot;) in the late 1980s.

The club invites interaction with its supporters and has a Fans&#x27; Parliament, at which independently selected candidates meet with club officials discuss issues relating to the club. An independent fanzine named &quot;A Load of Bull&quot; (ALOB), in part a reference to leading goalscorer Steve Bull, published supporters&#x27; views between 1989 and 2012.

==Ownership and finances==
The club is owned by the Chinese conglomerate group Fosun International, which purchased the parent company of the club, W.W. (1990) Ltd., on 21 July 2016 for a reported £45 million from previous owner Steve Morgan and his company Bridgemere Group. In the last published accounts of Wolves&#x27; group parent company (covering the 2018–19 Premier League season), a pre-tax profit of just under £20 million was recorded, with turnover for the year equalling £172.5m. £92.1 million was spent on staff wages and costs.

Like most football clubs, significant commercial income is generated from shirt sponsorship deals. Past shirt sponsorship deals were as follows: Tatung (1982–86), Benjamin Perry (1986), Staw Distribution (1986–88), Manders Paint &amp; Ink (1988–90), Goodyear (1990–2002), Doritos (2002–04), Chaucer Consulting (2004–09), Sportingbet (2009–13), What House? (2013–15), Silverbug (2015–16), The Money Shop (2016–18), W88 (2018–19). ManBetX (2019–2022) and AstroPay (2022-).

Fosun bought Wolves from Steve Morgan, who had taken ownership in August 2007 for a nominal sum of £10 with the proviso that £30 million was injected into the club, ending an almost four-year search for a new buyer. Morgan oversaw nine full seasons, but placed the club on the market for new owners in September 2015. Morgan had bought the club from Sir Jack Hayward, a lifelong fan of the club, who had himself purchased it in 1990 for £2.1 million. During his tenure Sir Jack invested an estimated £50 million of his personal wealth to rebuild the club&#x27;s stadium and fund new players, but the team only achieved one season in the top flight during his 17 years at the helm despite this increased spending power.

Hayward&#x27;s takeover greatly improved the club&#x27;s financial health, after a turbulent 1980s in which the club twice was declared bankrupt. In 1982 the club was &quot;saved&quot; from liquidation when it was purchased by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti, as part of their company Allied Properties. However, their failure to sufficiently invest in the club saw it face several winding-up orders as well as successive relegations through the football divisions. In 1986 the official receiver was again called in and a deal eventually brokered for Wolverhampton City Council to purchase the club&#x27;s stadium for £1.12 million, along with the surrounding land, while a local developer, Gallagher Estates, in conjunction with the Asda supermarket chain, agreed to pay off the club&#x27;s outstanding debts in return for the building of an Asda superstore on land adjacent to the stadium.

==Honours==
In the all-time table since the league&#x27;s inception in 1888, Wolves sit fourth in terms of points gathered in all divisions (as of the conclusion of the 2018–19 season), with only Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal having accumulated more points in total. Wolves were the first side to win all four divisions of the English professional game and have won every competition currently contested in English domestic football.

==League history==

Wolverhampton Wanderers was a founder member of the Football League in 1888. The 2023–24 season is Wolves&#x27; 125th in the Football League system. Wolves have spent 118 of their 124 completed seasons to date within the top two tiers of English football. Wolves played in the third tier on four occasions, each occasion lasting just one season; three of these seasons ended with promotion back to the second tier as Champions, and one ended in relegation to the fourth tier. The club has played two seasons in England&#x27;s fourth tier (in the 1980s).

<text>Erythropoietin (; EPO), also known as erythropoetin, haematopoietin, or haemopoietin, is a glycoprotein cytokine secreted mainly by the kidneys in response to cellular hypoxia; it stimulates red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in the bone marrow. Low levels of EPO (around 10 mU/mL) are constantly secreted in sufficient quantities to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover. Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO (up to 10 000 mU/mL) include any anemia, and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease and mouth disease.

Erythropoietin is largely synthesized by fibroblast-like type-1 interstitial cells, located primarily in the deep renal cortex in close association with the peritubular capillaries and proximal convoluted tubule; it is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver. Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period; renal production predominates in adulthood. It is homologous with thrombopoietin.

Exogenous erythropoietin, recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO), is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA): two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta. ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease, anemia in myelodysplasia, and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy. Risks of therapy include death, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and tumor recurrence. Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL: this is to be avoided.

rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug. It can often be detected in blood, due to slight differences from the endogenous protein; for example, in features of posttranslational modification.

==Pharmacology==
EPO is highly glycosylated (40% of total molecular weight), with half-life in blood around 5 h. EPO&#x27;s half-life may vary between endogenous and various recombinant versions. Additional glycosylation or other alterations of EPO via recombinant technology have led to the increase of EPO&#x27;s stability in blood (thus requiring less frequent injections).

== Function ==

=== Red blood cell production ===
Erythropoietin is an essential hormone for red blood cell production. Without it, definitive erythropoiesis does not take place. Under hypoxic conditions, the kidney will produce and secrete erythropoietin to increase the production of red blood cells by targeting CFU-E, proerythroblast and basophilic erythroblast subsets in the differentiation. Erythropoietin has its primary effect on red blood cell progenitors and precursors (which are found in the bone marrow in humans) by promoting their survival through protecting these cells from apoptosis, or cell death.

Erythropoietin is the primary erythropoietic factor that cooperates with various other growth factors (e.g., IL-3, IL-6, glucocorticoids, and SCF) involved in the development of erythroid lineage from multipotent progenitors. The burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells start erythropoietin receptor expression and are sensitive to erythropoietin. Subsequent stage, the colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E), expresses maximal erythropoietin receptor density and is completely dependent on erythropoietin for further differentiation. Precursors of red cells, the proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts also express erythropoietin receptor and are therefore affected by it.

=== Nonhematopoietic roles ===
Erythropoietin was reported to have a range of actions beyond stimulation of erythropoiesis including vasoconstriction-dependent hypertension, stimulating angiogenesis, and promoting cell survival via activation of EPO receptors resulting in anti-apoptotic effects on ischemic tissues. However this proposal is controversial with numerous studies showing no effect. It is also inconsistent with the low levels of EPO receptors on those cells. Clinical trials in humans with ischemic heart, neural and renal tissues have not demonstrated the same benefits seen in animals. In addition some research studies have shown its neuroprotective effect on diabetic neuropathy, however these data were not confirmed in clinical trials that have been conducted on the deep peroneal, superficial peroneal, tibial and sural nerves.

== Mechanism of action ==
Erythropoietin has been shown to exert its effects by binding to the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). EPO binds to the erythropoietin receptor on the red cell progenitor surface and activates a JAK2 signalling cascade. This initiates the STAT5, PIK3 and Ras MAPK pathways. This results in differentiation, survival and proliferation of the erythroid cell. SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS are also expressed which act as negative regulators of the cytokine signal.

High level erythropoietin receptor expression is localized to erythroid progenitor cells. While there are reports that EPO receptors are found in a number of other tissues, such as heart, muscle, kidney and peripheral/central nervous tissue, those results are confounded by nonspecificity of reagents such as anti-EpoR antibodies. In controlled experiments, a functional EPO receptor is not detected in those tissues. In the bloodstream, red cells themselves do not express erythropoietin receptor, so cannot respond to EPO. However, indirect dependence of red cell longevity in the blood on plasma erythropoietin levels has been reported, a process termed neocytolysis. In addition, there is conclusive evidence that EPO receptor expression is upregulated in brain injury.

== Synthesis and regulation ==
Erythropoietin levels in blood are quite low in the absence of anemia, at around 10 mU/mL. However, in hypoxic stress, EPO production may increase up to 1000-fold, reaching 10 000 mU/mL of blood. In adults, EPO is mainly synthesized by peritubular fibroblast-like type-1 interstitial cells in the deep renal cortex, with additional amounts being produced in the liver, and the pericytes in the brain. Regulation is believed to rely on a feedback mechanism measuring blood oxygenation and iron availability. Constitutively synthesized transcription factors for EPO, known as hypoxia-inducible factors, are hydroxylated and proteosomally digested in the presence of oxygen and iron. During normoxia GATA2 inhibits the promoter region for EPO. GATA2 levels decrease during hypoxia and allow the promotion of EPO production.

Erythropoietin production can be induced by HIF-2α as well as by PGC-1α. Erythropoietin also activates these factors, resulting in a positive feedback loop.
== Medical use ==

Erythropoietins available for use as therapeutic agents are produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture, and include Epogen/Procrit (epoetin alfa) and Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa); they are used in treating anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy induced anemia in patients with cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis) and myelodysplasia from the treatment of cancer (chemotherapy and radiation). The package inserts include boxed warnings of increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and tumor recurrence, particularly when used to increase the hemoglobin levels to more than 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL.

== History ==
In 1905, Paul Carnot proposed the idea that a hormone regulates the production of red blood cells. After conducting experiments on rabbits subject to bloodletting, Carnot and his graduate student Clotilde-Camille Deflandre attributed an increase in red blood cells in rabbit subjects to a hemotropic factor called hemopoietin. Eva Bonsdorff and Eeva Jalavisto called the hemopoietic substance &#x27;erythropoietin&#x27;. K.R. Reissman and Allan J. Erslev demonstrated that a certain substance, circulated in the blood, is able to stimulate red blood cell production and increase hematocrit. This substance was purified and confirmed as erythropoietin.

In 1977, Goldwasser and Kung purified EPO. Pure EPO allowed the amino acid sequence to be partially identified and the gene to be isolated. Synthetic EPO was first successfully used to correct anemia in 1987. In 1985, Lin &quot;et al&quot; isolated the human erythropoietin gene from a genomic phage library and used it to produce EPO. In 1989, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the hormone Epogen for use in certain anemias.

Gregg L. Semenza and Peter J. Ratcliffe studied the EPO gene and its oxygen-dependent regulation. Along with William Kaelin Jr., they were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which regulates the EPO gene, as well as other genes, in response to hypoxia.

===Biosimilars===
In December 2007, Retacrit and Silapo (both epoetin zeta) were approved for use in the European Union.

==Usage as doping product==
As a performance-enhancing drug, EPO has been banned since the early 1990s, but a first test was not available until the 2000 Summer Olympics. Before this test was available, some athletes were sanctioned after confessing to having used EPO, for example in the Festina affair, when a car with doping products for the Festina cycling team was found.

The first doping test in cycling was used in the 2001 La Flèche Wallonne. The first rider to test positive in that race was Bo Hamburger, although he was later acquitted because his B-sample was not conclusive.

The U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team, under the leadership of Lance Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel, ran a sophisticated doping program that lasted for many years during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Erythropoietin was a common substance used by the cyclists.

A 2007 study showed that EPO has a A 2017 study showed at &quot;submaximal&quot; exertion the effects of EPO were not distinguishable from a placebo. Stating &quot;[At] Submaximal [exertion]...[mean power] did not differ between groups.&quot; Nevertheless, at &quot;maximal [exertion power output was] higher in the rHuEPO group compared with the placebo group.&quot; So, even though there was no difference at lower levels of exertion at &quot;maximal&quot; exertion the EPO group &quot;still&quot; performed better than the placebo group.

In March 2019, American mixed martial artist and former UFC Bantamweight Champion T.J. Dillashaw tested positive for EPO in a drug test administered by USADA, and was stripped of the UFC bantamweight title and suspended for 2 years. In September 2023 two-time tennis major champion Simona Halep received a 4-year suspension by the International Tennis Integrity Agency for two separate violations, one concerning the level of EPO in a blood sample collected in August 2022; Halep maintained her innocence, and indicated she would appeal the ban. Halep was later cleared to return following a successful appeal, due to findings that a contaminated supplement most likely contributed to the positive tests.

<text>In Christian denominations that practice infant baptism, confirmation is seen as the sealing of the covenant created in baptism. Those being confirmed are known as confirmands. For adults, it is an of belief. The ceremony typically involves laying on of hands.

Catholicism views Baptism as a sacrament. The sacrament is called chrismation in Eastern Christianity. In the East it takes place immediately after baptism; in the West, when a child reaches the age of reason or early adolescence, or in the case of adult baptism immediately afterwards in the same ceremony. Among those Christians who practise confirmation during their teenage years, the practice may be perceived, secondarily, as a coming of age rite.

In many Protestant denominations, such as the Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Reformed traditions, confirmation is a rite that often includes a profession of faith by an already baptized person. Confirmation is required by Lutherans, Anglicans and other traditional Protestant denominations for full membership in the respective church; the covenant theology of Reformed churches considers baptized infants members of the church, while confirmation or &quot;profession of faith&quot; is required for admittance to the Lord&#x27;s Table. In Catholic theology, it is the sacrament of baptism that confers membership, while &quot;reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace&quot;. The Catholic and Methodist denominations teach that in confirmation, the Holy Spirit strengthens a baptized individual for their faith journey.

Confirmation is not practised in Baptist, Anabaptist and other groups that teach believer&#x27;s baptism. Thus, the sacrament or rite of confirmation is administered to those being received from those aforementioned groups, in addition to those converts from non-Christian religions.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) does not practise infant baptism, but individuals can be baptized after they reach 8 years old (the age of accountability). Confirmation in the LDS Church occurs shortly following baptism, which is not considered complete or fully efficacious until confirmation is received.

There is an analogous ceremony also called confirmation in Reform Judaism. Various secular organizations also offer secular coming-of-age ceremonies as an alternative to Christian confirmation, while Unitarian Universalists have a similar Coming of Age ceremony.

==Scriptural foundation==

The roots of confirmation are found in the Church of the New Testament. In the Gospel of John chapter 14, Christ speaks of the coming of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles (John 14:15–26). Later, after his Resurrection, Jesus breathed upon them and they received the Holy Spirit (John 20:22), a process completed on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4). In Christianity, this Pentecostal outpouring of the Spirit was held as the sign of the messianic age foretold by the prophets (cf. Ezekiel 36:25–27; Joel 3:1–2). Its arrival was proclaimed by the Apostle Peter. Filled with the Holy Spirit, the apostles began to proclaim &quot;the mighty works of God&quot; (Acts 2:11; Cf. 2:17–18). After this point, the New Testament records the apostles bestowing the Holy Spirit upon others through the laying on of hands.

Three texts make it certain that a laying on of hands for the imparting of the Spirit – performed after the water-bath and as a complement to this bath – existed already in the earliest apostolic times. These texts are Acts 8:4–20 and 19:1–7, and Hebrews 6:1–6.

In the Acts of the Apostles 8:14–17, different ministers are named for the two actions. It is not deacon Philip, the baptiser, but only the apostles who were able to impart the pneuma through the laying on of hands:

Further on in the text, connection between the gift of the Holy Spirit and the gesture of laying on of hands appears even more clearly. Acts 8:18–19 introduces the request of Simon the Magician in the following way: &quot;When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles&#x27; hands&quot;. In Acts 19, baptism of the disciples is mentioned in quite general terms, without the minister being identified. Referring to 1 Corinthians 1:17, it can be presumed that Paul left the action of baptising to others. However, Acts 19:6 then expressly states that it was Apostle Paul who laid his hands upon the newly baptised. Hebrews 6:1–6 distinguishes &quot;the teaching about baptisms&quot; from the teaching about &quot;the laying on of hands&quot;. The difference may be understood in the light of the two passages in Acts 8 and 19.

==Christian denominational views==
===Catholic Church===
In the teaching of the Catholic Church, confirmation, known also as chrismation, is one of the seven sacraments instituted by Christ for the conferral of sanctifying grace and the strengthening of the union between the individual and God.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; in paragraphs 1302–1303, states:

In the Catholic Church, the sacrament is customarily conferred only on persons old enough to understand it, and the ordinary minister of confirmation is a bishop. &quot;If necessity so requires&quot;, the diocesan bishop may grant specified priests the faculty to administer the sacrament, although normally he is to administer it himself or ensure that it is conferred by another bishop. In addition, the law itself confers the same faculty on the following:

&quot;According to the ancient practice maintained in the Roman liturgy, an adult is not to be baptized unless he receives Confirmation immediately afterward, provided no serious obstacles exist.&quot; Administration of the two sacraments, one immediately after the other, to adults is normally done by the bishop of the diocese (generally at the Easter Vigil) since &quot;the baptism of adults, at least of those who have completed their fourteenth year, is to be referred to the Bishop, so that he himself may confer it if he judges this appropriate&quot; However, if the bishop does not confer the baptism, then it devolves on the priest whose office it then is to confer both sacraments, since, &quot;in addition to the bishop, the law gives the faculty to confirm to the following... priests who, in virtue of an office which they lawfully hold, baptize an adult or a child old enough for catechesis or receive a validly baptized adult into full communion with the Church.&quot;

In Eastern Catholic Churches, the usual minister of this sacrament is the parish priest, using olive oil consecrated by a bishop (i.e. chrism) and administering the sacrament immediately after baptism. This corresponds exactly to the practice of the early Church, when at first those receiving baptism were mainly adults, and of the non-Latin Catholic Eastern Churches.

====Rite of confirmation in the West====
The main reason why the West separated the sacrament of confirmation from that of baptism was to re-establish direct contact between the person being initiated with the bishops. In the Early Church, the bishop administered all three sacraments of initiation (baptism, confirmation and Eucharist), assisted by the priests and deacons and, where they existed, by deaconesses for women&#x27;s baptism. The post-baptismal chrismation in particular was reserved to the bishop. When adults no longer formed the majority of those being baptized, this chrismation was delayed until the bishop could confer it. Until the 12th century, priests often continued to confer confirmation before giving Communion to very young children.

After the Fourth Lateran Council, Communion, which continued to be given only after confirmation, was to be administered only on reaching the age of reason. Some time after the 13th century, the age of confirmation and Communion began to be delayed further, from seven, to twelve and to fifteen. In the 18th century, in France the sequence of sacraments of initiation was changed. Bishops started to impart confirmation only after the first Eucharistic communion. The reason was no longer the busy calendar of the bishop, but the bishop&#x27;s will to give adequate instruction to the youth. The practice lasted until Pope Leo XIII in 1897 asked to restore the primary order and to celebrate confirmation back at the age of reason, a change that lasted less than two decades. In 1910, his successor, Pope Pius X, showing concern for the easy access to the Eucharist for children, in his Letter lowered the age of first communion to seven. That was the origin of the widespread custom in parishes to organise the First Communion for children at .

The 1917 Code of Canon Law, while recommending that confirmation be delayed until about seven years of age, allowed it be given at an earlier age. Only on 30 June 1932 was official permission given to change the traditional order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation: the Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments then allowed, where necessary, that confirmation be administered first Holy Communion. This novelty, originally seen as exceptional, became more and more the accepted practice. Thus, in the mid-20th century, confirmation began to be seen as an occasion for professing personal commitment to the faith on the part of someone approaching adulthood.

However, the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1308) warns: &quot;Although Confirmation is sometimes called the &#x27;sacrament of Christian maturity,&#x27; we must not confuse adult faith with the adult age of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace is a grace of free, unmerited election and does not need &#x27;ratification&#x27; to become effective.&quot;

On the canonical age for confirmation in the Latin Church Catholic Church, the present 1983 Code of Canon Law, which maintains unaltered the rule in the 1917 Code, lays down that the sacrament is to be conferred on the faithful at about the age of discretion (generally taken to be about 7), unless the episcopal conference has decided on a different age, or there is a danger of death or, in the judgement of the minister, a grave reason suggests otherwise (canon 891 of the Code of Canon Law). The Code prescribes the age of discretion also for the sacraments of Reconciliation and first Holy Communion.

In some places the setting of a later age, e.g. mid-teens in the United States, 11 or 12 in Ireland and early teens in Britain, has been abandoned in recent decades in favor of restoring the traditional order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation. Even where a later age has been set, a bishop may not refuse to confer the sacrament on younger children who request it, provided they are baptized, have the use of reason, are suitably instructed and are properly disposed and able to renew the baptismal promises.

====Effects of confirmation====
The Catholic Church Anglo-Catholics teach that, like baptism, confirmation marks the recipient permanently, making it impossible to receive the sacrament twice. It accepts as valid a confirmation conferred within churches, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, whose Holy Orders it sees as valid through the apostolic succession of their bishops. But it considers it necessary to administer the sacrament of confirmation, in its view for the only time, to Protestants who are admitted to full communion with the Catholic Church.

One of the effects of the sacrament is that &quot;it gives us a special strength of the Holy Spirit to spread and defend the faith by word and action as true witnesses of Christ, to confess the name of Christ boldly, and never to be ashamed of the Cross&quot;. This effect was described by the Council of Trent as making the confirmed person &quot;a soldier of Christ&quot;.

The same passage of the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; also mentions, as an effect of confirmation, that &quot;it renders our bond with the Church more perfect&quot;. This mention stresses the importance of participation in the Christian community.

The &quot;soldier of Christ&quot; imagery was used, as far back as 350, by St Cyril of Jerusalem. In this connection, the touch on the cheek that the bishop gave while saying &quot; () to the person he had just confirmed was interpreted in the Roman Pontifical as a slap, a reminder to be brave in spreading and defending the faith: &quot; (). When, in application of the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, the confirmation rite was revised in 1971, mention of this gesture was omitted. However, the French and Italian translations, indicating that the bishop should accompany the words &quot;Peace be with you&quot; with &quot;a friendly gesture&quot; (French text) or &quot;the sign of peace&quot; (Italian text), explicitly allow a gesture such as the touch on the cheek, to which they restore its original meaning. This is in accord with the Introduction to the rite of confirmation, 17, which indicates that the episcopal conference may decide &quot;to introduce a different manner for the minister to give the sign of peace after the anointing, either to each individual or to all the newly confirmed together&quot;.

====Tradition====
In some regions it is customary for the person being confirmed to choose the name of a saint, which they adopt as their confirmation name. The saint whose name is taken is henceforth considered to be a patron saint.
===Eastern Churches===
The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches refer to this sacrament (or, more properly, Sacred Mystery) as chrismation, a term which western rite Catholics also use; for instance, in Italian the term is . Eastern Christians link chrismation closely with the sacred mystery of baptism, conferring it immediately after baptism, which is normally on infants.

The sacred tradition of the Orthodox Church teaches that the Apostles themselves established the practice of anointing with chrism (consecrated oil) in place of the laying on of hands when bestowing the sacrament. As the numbers of converts grew, it became physically impossible for the apostles to lay hands upon each of the newly baptized. So the Apostles laid hands upon a vessel of oil, bestowing the Holy Spirit upon it, which was then distributed to all of the presbyters (priests) for their use when they baptized. The same chrism is in use to this day, never being completely depleted but newly consecrated chrism only being added to it as needed (this consecration traditionally is performed only by the primates of certain autocephalous churches on Great Thursday) and it is believed that chrism in use today contains some small amount of the original chrism made by the apostles.

When Catholics and traditional Protestants, such as Lutherans, Anglicans and Methodists, convert to Orthodoxy, they are often admitted by chrismation, without baptism; but, since this is a matter of local episcopal discretion, a bishop may require all converts to be admitted by baptism if he deems it necessary. Depending upon the form of the original baptism, some Protestants must be baptized upon conversion to Orthodoxy. A common practice is that those persons who have been previously baptized by triple immersion in the name of the Trinity do not need to be baptized. However, requirements will differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and some traditional Orthodox jurisdictions prefer to baptize all converts. When a person is received into the church, whether by baptism or chrismation, they will often take the name of a saint, who will become their patron saint. Thenceforward, the feast day of that saint will be celebrated as the convert&#x27;s name day, which in traditional Orthodox cultures is celebrated in lieu of one&#x27;s birthday.

The Orthodox rite of chrismation takes place immediately after baptism and clothing the &quot;newly illumined&quot; (i.e., newly baptized) in their baptismal robe. The priest makes the sign of the cross with the chrism (also referred to as myrrh) on the brow, eyes, nostrils, lips, both ears, breast, hands and feet of the newly illumined, saying with each anointing: &quot;The seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit. Amen.&quot; Then the priest will place his epitrachelion (stole) over the newly illumined and leads them and their sponsors in a procession, circling three times around the Gospel Book, while the choir chants each time: &quot;As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Alleluia&quot; (Galatians 3:27).

The reason the Eastern Churches perform chrismation immediately after baptism is so that the newly baptized may receive Holy Communion, which is commonly given to infants as well as adults.

An individual may be baptized &quot;in extremis&quot; (in a life-threatening emergency) by any baptized member of the church; however, only a priest or bishop may perform the mystery of chrismation. If someone who has been baptized &quot;in extremis&quot; survives, the priest then performs the chrismation.

The Catholic Church does not confirm converts to Catholicism who have been chrismated in a non-Catholic Eastern church, considering that the sacrament has been validly conferred and may not be repeated.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church the sacrament may be conferred more than once and it is customary to receive returning or repentant apostates by repeating chrismation.

===Lutheran Churches===
Lutheran confirmation is a public profession of faith prepared for by long and careful instruction. In English, it is called &quot;affirmation of baptism&quot;, and is a mature and public profession of the faith which &quot;marks the completion of the congregation&#x27;s program of confirmation ministry&quot;. The German language also uses for Lutheran confirmation a different word () from the word used for the sacramental rite of the Catholic Church ().

Lutheran churches do not treat confirmation as a dominical sacrament of the Gospel, considering that only Baptism, Eucharist and Confession and Absolution can be regarded as such. Some popular Sundays for this to occur are Palm Sunday, Pentecost and Reformation Sunday (last Sunday in October).

===Anglican Communion===
Article 25 of the 16th-century Thirty-nine Articles lists confirmation among those rites &quot;commonly called Sacraments&quot; which are &quot;not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel&quot; (a term referring to the dominical sacraments, i.e. baptism and the Holy Eucharist), because they were not directly instituted by Christ with a specific matter and form, and they are not generally necessary to salvation. The language of the Articles has led some to deny that confirmation and the other rites are sacraments at all. Others maintain that &quot;commonly called Sacraments&quot; does not mean &quot;wrongly called Sacraments&quot;.

Many Anglicans, especially Anglo-Catholics, count the rite as one of seven sacraments. While most provinces of the Anglican Communion do not make provision for ministers other than bishops to administer confirmation, presbyters can be authorized to do so in certain South Asian provinces, which are united churches. Similarly, the American Episcopal Church recognizes that &quot;those who have previously made a mature public commitment in another Church may be received by the laying on of hands by a Bishop of this Church, rather than confirmed.&quot; Furthermore, at its General Convention in 2015 a resolution advancing presbyteral confirmation was referred to committee for further review.

&quot;[T]he renewal of the baptismal vows, which is part of the Anglican Confirmation service, is in no way necessary to Confirmation and can be done more than once... When Confirmation is given early, candidates may be asked to make a fresh renewal of vows when they approach adult life at about eighteen.&quot; The 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England employs the phrase &quot;ratify and confirm&quot; with respect to these vows which has led to the common conception of confirmation as the renewal of baptismal vows. While such a view closely aligns to the doctrine of confirmation held by Lutherans, the dominant Anglican position is perhaps better evidenced in the attempt to replace &quot;ratify and confirm&quot; with &quot;ratify and confess&quot; in the proposed 1928 prayer book, which was defeated in the House of Commons 14 June of that year.

===Methodist Churches===
In the Methodist Church confirmation is defined by the Articles of Religion as one those &quot;Commonly called Sacraments but not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel&quot;, also known as the &quot;five lesser sacraments&quot;. The &quot;Methodist Worship Book&quot; declares that:

&quot;By Water and Spirit&quot;, an official United Methodist publication, states that &quot;it should be emphasized that Confirmation is what the Holy Spirit does. Confirmation is a divine action, the work of the Spirit empowering a person &#x27;born through water and the Spirit&#x27; to &#x27;live as a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ&#x27;.&quot; The Methodist theologian John William Fletcher saw confirmation as a means of grace. Furthermore, confirmation is the individual&#x27;s first public affirmation of the grace of God in baptism and the acknowledgment of the acceptance of that grace by faith. For those baptized as infants, it often occurs when youth enter their 6th through 8th grade years, but it may occur earlier or later. For youth and adults who are joining the Church, &quot;those who are baptized are also confirmed, remembering that our ritual reflects the ancient unity of baptism, confirmation (laying on of hands with prayer), and Eucharist.&quot; Candidates to be confirmed, known as confirmands, take a class which covers Christian doctrine, theology, Methodist Church history, stewardship, basic Bible study and other topics.

While the Holy Spirit strengthens the believer in confirmation, in Methodist theology, it is though entire sanctification that a believer is baptized (filled) with the Holy Spirit, thus being made perfect in love and wholly devoted to God, cleansed of original sin (the carnal nature), and empowered to accomplish all to which they are called. John Fletcher saw the attainment of entire sanctification as being the goal of the vows made at the ordinance of confirmation. John Wesley laid emphasis &quot;upon a personal, non-ceremonial experience of sanctifying grace&quot; and this second work of grace—entire sanctification—distinguishes Methodism.

===Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Continental Reformed Churches===
The Presbyterian Church in America process of confirmation is not necessarily public, and depends on the congregation as to the nature of confirmation. In practice, many churches require and offer classes for Confirmation.

The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) confirmation process is a profession of faith that &quot;seeks to provide youth with a foundational understanding of our faith, tradition and Presbyterian practices&quot;.

===Irvingian Churches===
In the New Apostolic Church, the largest of the Irvingian denominations, Confirmation is a rite that &quot;strengthens the confirmands in their endeavour to keep their vow to profess Jesus Christ in word and deed&quot;. Confirmation is celebrated within the Divine Service and in it, confirmands take the following vow:
Following the recitation of the vow, &quot;young Christians receive the confirmation blessing, which is dispensed upon them through laying on of hands&quot;.

===United Protestant Churches===
In United Protestant Churches, such as the United Church of Canada, Church of North India, Church of Pakistan, Church of South India, Uniting Church in Australia and United Church of Christ in Japan, confirmation is a rite that is &quot;understood as a Christian person assuming the responsibilities of the promises made at baptism.&quot;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
When discussing confirmation, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) uses the term &quot;ordinance&quot; owing to their origins in a Protestant environment, but the actual doctrine describing their ordinances and their effects is sacramental. Church ordinances are understood as administering grace and must be conducted by properly ordained clergy members through apostolic succession reaching back through Peter to Christ, although the line of authority differs from Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. Baptism by water is understood as representing the death of the old person and their resurrection from that death into a new life in Christ. Through baptism by water, sin, and guilt are washed away as the old sinner dies and the new child of Christ emerges. Confirmation is understood as being the baptism by fire wherein the Holy Spirit enters into the individual, purges them of the effects of the sin from their previous life (the guilt and culpability of which were already washed away), and introduces them into the church as a new person in Christ. Through confirmation, the individual receives the Gift of the Holy Ghost, granting the individual the permanent companionship of the Holy Ghost as long as the person does not wilfully drive him away through sin.

The ceremony is significantly simpler than in Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches and is performed by an ordained clergyman as follows:

# Lays his hands upon the individual&#x27;s head and states the person&#x27;s full name.
# States that the ordinance is performed by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
# Confirms the person a member of the LDS Church.
# Bestows the gift of the Holy Ghost by saying, &quot;Receive the Holy Ghost.&quot;
# Gives a priesthood blessing as the Spirit directs.
# Closes in the name of Jesus Christ.

Other actions typically associated with confirmation in Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy, such as the reception of a Christian name, anointing of body parts with chrism, and the clothing of the confirmant in a white garment or chiton are conducted separately as part of a ceremony called the Initiatory.

==Confirmation name==
In many countries, it is customary for a person being confirmed in some dioceses of Catholic Church and in parts of Lutheranism and Anglicanism to adopt a new name, generally the name of a biblical character or saint, thus securing an additional patron saint as protector and guide. This practice is not mentioned in the official liturgical book of the rite of confirmation and is not in use in Spanish and French-speaking lands, nor in Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands or the Philippines. Although some insist on the custom, it is discouraged by others and in any case is only a secondary aspect of confirmation.

As indicated by the different senses of the word &quot;christening&quot;, baptism and the giving of a personal name have traditionally been linked. At confirmation, in which the intervention of a godparent strengthens a resemblance with baptism, it became customary to take a new name, as was also the custom on other occasions, in particular that of religious profession. King Henry III of France (1551–1589) was christened Edouard Alexandre in 1551, but at confirmation received the name Henri, by which he afterwards reigned. Today usually no great use is made of the confirmation name, although some treat it as an additional middle name. For example, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; author George R. R. Martin was born George Raymond Martin, but added his confirmation name Richard as a second middle name. However, even after the English Reformation, the legal system of that country admitted the lawfulness of using one&#x27;s confirmation name in, for instance, purchasing land.

==Repetition of the sacrament or rite==
The Catholic Church sees confirmation as one of the three sacraments that no one can receive more than once (see sacramental character). It recognizes as already confirmed those who enter the Catholic Church after receiving the sacrament, even as babies, in the churches of Eastern Christianity, but it confers the sacrament (in its view, for the first and only time) on those who enter the Catholic Church after being confirmed in Protestant churches, seeing these churches as lacking properly ordained ministers.

In the Lutheran Churches, those individuals who received the sacrament of baptism according to the Trinitarian formula in a non-Lutheran church are confirmed as Lutherans, ordinarily during the Easter Vigil—the first liturgy of Eastertide. The rite of confirmation is preceded by a period of catechetical instruction.

In the Anglican Communion, a person who was previously confirmed in another denomination by a bishop or priest recognized as validly ordained is &quot;received&quot; rather than confirmed again. Some dioceses of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America recognize non-episcopal Confirmations as well and these individuals are received into the Anglican Communion rather than re-confirmed. In other dioceses, confirmations of those Christian denominations are recognized if they have a valid apostolic succession in the eyes of the Anglican Communion (e.g. Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Catholic Church, etc.).

Eastern Orthodox churches occasionally practise what is seen by other Christians as &quot;re-Chrismation&quot;, in that they usually chrismate/confirm – and sometimes rebaptize – a convert, even one previously confirmed in other churches. The justification is that the new Chrismation (or baptism) is the only valid one, the earlier one being administered outside of the Church and hence being little more than a symbol. The Eastern Orthodox will also chrismate an apostate from the Orthodox Church who repents and re-enters communion. According to some interpretations, the Eastern churches therefore view confirmation/Chrismation as a repeatable sacrament. According to others, the rite is understood as &quot;part of a process of reconciliation, rather than as a reiteration of post-baptismal chrismation&quot;.

==Analogous ceremonies in non-Christian practice==
===Judaism===

In the 1800s Reform Judaism developed a separate ceremony, called confirmation, loosely modeled on Christian confirmation ceremonies. This occurred because, at the time, Reform Jews believed that it was inappropriate for bar/bat mitzvah-age children to be considered mature enough to understand what it means to be religious. It was held that children of this age were not responsible enough to understand what it means to observe religious practices. Israel Jacobson developed the confirmation ceremony to replace bar/bat mitzvah. Originally this ceremony was for 13-year-old boys. In later decades, the Reform movement modified this view, and now much of Reform Judaism in the United States encourages children to celebrate becoming bar/bat mitzvah at the traditional age, and then has the confirmation at the later age as a sign of a more advanced completion of their Jewish studies.

Today, many Reform Jewish congregations hold confirmation ceremonies as a way of marking the biblical festival of Shavuot and the decision of young adults to embrace Jewish study in their lives and reaffirm their commitment to the Covenant. The confirmands represent &quot;the first fruits of each year&#x27;s harvest. They represent the hope and promise of tomorrow.&quot; Confirmation is typically held in tenth grade after a year of study, but some synagogues celebrate it in other years of high school.

Confirmation, in the context of Reform Judaism, was mentioned officially for the first time in an ordinance issued by the Jewish consistory of the kingdom of Westphalia at Cassel in 1810. There it was made the duty of the rabbi &quot;to prepare the young for confirmation, and personally to conduct the ceremony.&quot; At first only boys were confirmed, on the Sabbath (&quot;Shabbat&quot;) that they celebrated becoming Bar Mitzvah; the ceremony was performed at the home or in the schoolroom. In Berlin, Jewish girls were confirmed for the first time in 1817, in Hamburg in 1818.

Confirmation was at first excluded from the synagogue, because, like every innovation, it met with stern opposition from more traditional rabbis. Gradually, however, it found more favor; Hebrew school classes were confirmed together, and confirmation gradually became a solemn celebration at the synagogue. In 1822 the first class of boys and girls was confirmed at the Hamburg Temple, and in 1831 Rabbi Samuel Egers, a prominent traditional rabbi of his time, began to confirm boys and girls at the synagogue of Brunswick. While in the beginning some Shabbat, frequently during Chanukah or Passover, was selected for confirmation, it became increasingly customary, following the example of Egers, to perform the ceremony during the biblical festival of Shavuot (&quot;Feast of Weeks&quot;). It was felt that Shavuot was well suited for the rite, as it celebrated the occasion when the Israelites on Mount Sinai declared their intention to accept the yoke of God&#x27;s Law, so those of every new generation should follow the ancient example and declare their willingness to be faithful to the Sinaitic covenant transmitted by their ancestors.

Confirmation was introduced in Denmark as early as 1817, in Hamburg in 1818, and in Hessen and Saxony in 1835. The Prussian government, which showed itself hostile to the Reform movement, prohibited it as late as 1836, as did Bavaria as late as 1838. It soon made its way, however, into all progressive congregations of Germany. In 1841 it was introduced in France, first in Bordeaux and Marseilles, then in Strasburg and Paris, under the name . The first Israelitish synod in 1869 at Leipsic adopted a report on religious education, the 13th section of which contains an elaborate opinion on confirmation, recommending the same to all Jewish congregations. In America, the annual confirmation of boys and girls was first resolved upon by the congregation of Temple Emanu-El of New York in 1847. The ceremony soon gained so firm a foothold in America that soon there was no progressive Jewish congregation in which it did not occur during Shavuot.

=== Secular confirmations ===

Several secular, mainly Humanist, organizations direct civil confirmations for older children, as a statement of their life stance that is an alternative to traditional religious ceremonies for children of that age.

Some atheist regimes have as a matter of policy fostered the replacement of Christian rituals such as confirmation with non-religious ones. In the historically Protestant German Democratic Republic (East Germany), for example, &quot;the (youth dedication) gradually supplanted the Christian practice of Confirmation.&quot; A concept that first appeared in 1852, the is described as &quot;a solemn initiation marking the transition from youth to adulthood that was developed in opposition to Protestant and Catholic Churches&#x27; Confirmation.&quot;

<text>Correspondence chess is chess played by various forms of long-distance correspondence, traditionally through the postal system. Today it is usually played through a correspondence chess server, a public internet chess forum, or email. Less common methods that have been employed include fax, homing pigeon and phone. It is in contrast to over-the-board (OTB) chess, where the players sit at a physical chessboard at the same time; and most online chess, where the players play each other in real time over the internet. However, correspondence chess can also be played online.

Correspondence chess allows people or clubs who are geographically distant to play one another without meeting in person. The length of a game played by correspondence can vary depending on the method used to transmit moves: a game played via a server or by email might last no more than a few days, weeks, or months; a game played by post between players in different countries might last several years.

== Structure ==
Correspondence chess differs from over-the-board (OTB) play in several respects. While players in OTB chess generally play one game at a time (an exception being a simultaneous exhibition), correspondence players often have several games going at once. Tournament games are played concurrently, and some players may have more than one hundred games continuing at the same time. 

Time limit in correspondence game is not rigidly defined, but it is generally accepted that, on average, it is never less than one day per move (not counting transmission time in postal chess). This time allows for far deeper calculation, meaning that blunders can be less frequent. Certain forms of assistance, including books, chess databases and sometimes chess programs, are often allowed. Books and opening databases are almost universally acceptable, but organizations vary as to whether chess engine use is permitted.

== Computer assistance ==

Computer assistance has altered correspondence chess. As players with poor chess knowledge can use the strongest computer programs to analyse their games, the gap between the beginner and master player has narrowed. The decline in the popularity of traditional postal correspondence chess occurred at the end of the 20th century. This is also when chess programs became widely accessible, and their playing strength soon reached the level of grandmasters. In OTB chess competitions, all chess organizations strictly prohibit the use of any electronic devices. In correspondence chess, there is no unequivocal stance either prohibiting or allowing the use of chess programs during games.

Chess.com&#x27;s Daily Chess strictly prohibits the use of chess engines and all winners&#x27; games are subject to computer analysis for fair play. A similar stance is taken by the United States Chess Federation, which in its regulations also explicitly prohibits the use of &quot;chess playing algorithms&quot; for evaluating games. The International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF) allows for collaboration between humans and computers, even during the World Correspondence Chess Championship. The ICCF calls this a &quot;hybrid competition that involves the strategy and planning of humans guided by the accuracy of machines&quot;.

Variant games are often played on public chess servers or chess forums. Since the games are a modified form, chess engines may be less helpful, or based on the variant, completely useless. For example, chess games played on an unbounded chessboard, or infinite chess, are virtually untouched by chess-playing software.

== Regulatory bodies ==

Correspondence chess tournaments are usually played under the auspices of an official regulatory body, most importantly the International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF), which is affiliated with FIDE, the international chess organization. However, the ICCF, which organizes postal and email events, is not the only organization involved in correspondence chess. There are numerous national and regional bodies for postal chess, as well as a number of organisations devoted to organizing email play for free such as the International Email Chess Group (IECG), Lechenicher SchachServer (LSS), and the Free Internet Correspondence Games Server (FICGS), that also run a world championship cycle, and International E-mail Chess Club (IECC). However, groups other than the ICCF are not sanctioned by FIDE.

The ICCF awards the titles International Master, Senior International Master and International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster—these are equivalent to similar titles awarded by FIDE for over-the-board chess. The ICCF also runs the World Correspondence Chess Championships. Because these events can last a long time, they may overlap: for instance, in February 2005 Joop van Oosterom was declared winner of the eighteenth Championship (which began in June 2003), though the winner of the seventeenth Championship (which began in March 2002) had not yet been determined.

Up until 2004, ICCF correspondence chess was played only via email and postal mail. For playing by these two forms of transmission, the ICCF sanctioned the use of ICCF numeric notation, sometimes known as Koch notation. However, if players agreed to use a mutually agreeable notation system, this was accepted.

In recent years, the use of increasingly powerful chess programs has brought forth new challenges for organizations like the ICCF and the U.S. Chess Federation, necessitating sometimes controversial decisions on the admissibility of such programs in official correspondence play.

Moreover, the emergence of the Internet has brought new opportunities for correspondence chess, not all of which are organized by official bodies. Casual correspondence chess includes correspondence play initiated through correspondence chess servers and games played between individuals who meet and play on their own. Casual correspondence play does not lead to official ratings, though some chess servers will calculate ratings for the players based on results on that server.

== Types ==
Correspondence chess has evolved into various forms, with server-based correspondence chess emerging as the most widespread in the contemporary world. Notably, major correspondence servers have grown in size and popularity, reaching the same prominence as online blitz chess servers.
The landscape of chess has further expanded with the surge in popularity of daily chess, particularly in the second decade of the 21st century. This growth is evident in the annual influx of thousands of new players. The heightened interest in daily chess is underscored by the participation in the Daily Chess Championships organized since 2018. While the first edition had just over 7,000 players, in 2023, due to the significant interest in the event, the organizer had to limit the number of participants to 35,000. 

=== Daily chess ===
Daily chess represents the adaptation of traditional correspondence chess to the digital realm of the Internet. The term &quot;daily chess&quot; has become commonplace, thanks to the multitude of tournaments hosted by chess.com platform. It is often characterized as a fusion of online chess and correspondence chess. The dynamic nature of daily chess borrows key elements from both online and correspondence chess. The immediacy and real-time interaction reminiscent of online chess are combined with the more contemplative pace and turn-based structure found in traditional correspondence chess. This amalgamation allows players to engage in matches with opponents from around the world without the pressure of immediate time constraints, a hallmark of traditional over-the-board (OTB) chess. In its fundamental form, daily chess requires players to complete each move within a strict 24-hour timeframe, as implied by its name. 

=== Server-based ===

Correspondence chess servers are usually database-driven and carry with them a web-based interface for submitting moves to the database. But they do create the possibility of facilitating any method of transmission, as long as the transmitted moves are audited within the server&#x27;s database.

Server fees vary. Most casual servers use a yearly charging model, whereby players can play as many tournaments or games as they want all year round. Some servers offer basic membership for free, with more services available for a fee. Also more casual servers allow the use of nicknames, and have a real-time rating system which often adjusts a player&#x27;s rating after each rated game. Casual servers also tend to have a wide range of facilities, such as online games databases, social and chess improvement forums, teams, and player homepages. More traditional correspondence chess servers often charge per tournament and force the use of real names. For example, competitors in the Correspondence Chess League of America use their real names rather than aliases.

The vast majority of chess platforms that enable playing chess also provide access to server-based correspondence / daily chess. However, not all of them allow switching to the analysis mode or offer a built-in library of openings or entire games.

=== Mobile ===
With the advent of smartphones such as Apple&#x27;s iPhone, Blackberry, and Android-based devices, correspondence chess has seen a recent rise in popularity as applications on these devices. Usually the devices use wireless internet or SMS technology to submit their moves to a central server.

=== Email-based ===
There are organizations devoted to organizing play by email, such as the International E-mail Chess Club (IECC).

Email play has gradually declined in popularity due to issues such as email viruses, opponents&#x27; claims of not receiving moves, and similar impediments to the point email play has arguably been superseded by server-based correspondence chess, where usually the interface to a chess server is a web-based interface.

=== Postal (traditional mail) ===
There are national and regional organizations for postal chess which use traditional &quot;snail mail&quot; for transmitting moves between players. The ICCF and affiliated local and national federations often organize postal events. Other examples of groups offering postal play include the Correspondence Chess League of America (CCLA) and the United States Chess Federation (USCF). However, groups other than the ICCF and affiliates are not sanctioned by FIDE.

Traditional postal chess organizations such as the International Correspondence Chess Federation, the Correspondence Chess League of America (CCLA), and the United States Chess Federation (USCF) have added email and/or server-based options to their correspondence play.

One of the older documented postal correspondence chess games is a game played in 1804 by lieutenant-colonel F.W. von Mauvillon of the Dutch army in The Hague with one of his officers in Breda. Actor Humphrey Bogart, a strong player (Class A to Expert) also played games of correspondence chess against American G.I.s through mail, at one point having his mail intercepted by the FBI due to fears the algebraic notation used in chess games was actually an encrypted message.

Postal correspondence chess has mostly been superseded by email and server-based correspondence chess. Furthermore, use of computers for chess analysis is becoming widespread.

== Time control ==
In the past, games exchanged through mailed envelopes with stamps could take months or even years. The normal time limit for International Correspondence Chess Federation games is 30 to 60 days for every 10 moves (not counting shipping time for postal chess).

In server-based correspondence chess most games are played at a pace of one move per day or several days. The most popular variants include:

* &quot;One move per day&quot;. The most common form of daily chess. This means that when a move is made by the first player, the clock for their opponent starts. They then have exactly 24 hours to respond. Being late means losing. In practice, this often means having to make a minimum of 2 moves per day. For example, if one decides to make moves only in the evening, the opponent might respond immediately. Then, trying to make the next move at a similar time the next day may result in being late and losing on time. Therefore, a common practice is to make moves in all ongoing games in the morning and then in the evening.
* &quot;One move every 3 days&quot;. The second most popular option. This is the optimal time for people with limited time resources. It is enough to make all moves once a day at any time to be sure not to lose on time. Additionally, games can also be played every two days.
* &quot;One move every 7 days&quot;. It is not very popular due to the very long duration of the games.
* &quot;One move every 14 days&quot;. It is the longest daily time control offered by most sites.
* Variants with a time reserve are also encountered. This means that a player has a few extra days, and in case of exceeding the basic time, they can still use these additional days. Another formula is, for example, several dozen days for a specified number of moves.
As an additional aid, chess portals allow setting notifications in the form of emails or app notifications (for smartphones). In such cases, players are informed that in a certain number of hours, they will exceed the time limit in a given game.

== Legacy ==
Chess is a game with great traditions dating back to the late sixth century. Therefore, efforts have been made to transfer as many features of correspondence chess to daily chess as possible:

* Allowing the use of opening books in paper form. Larger platforms also allow the use of electronic opening libraries and even offer built-in opening trees available during the analysis of a played game. In general, reviewing games played only by people is allowed. Libraries with games played by chess engines are prohibited.
* Introducing the possibility of providing entire variations. In the 20th century, to save the number of sent letters, players sometimes, in addition to their own move, sent conditional variations. They provided their next move in case of a specific response from the opponent. Current applications for daily chess allow entering entire variations. They are invisible to the opponent. However, if they make a move from the entered conditional variation, the application automatically sends the next move.
* Prohibiting the use of chess engines.

== Over-the-board players who also play correspondence chess ==
Although nowadays the strongest correspondence players are specialists, a number of notable players in over-the-board (OTB) chess have in the past played postal games during their chess career.

Paul Keres, an Estonian sometimes regarded as the strongest player to never become world champion, played many games of correspondence chess. OTB world champions Alexander Alekhine and Max Euwe also played. Ulf Andersson also achieved very high ratings in both ICCF and FIDE, remaining in the FIDE top 100 until June 2002 and consistently ranked second on ICCF. Andrei Sokolov is another OTB GM who has recently taken up email chess. World Correspondence Champion Hans Berliner was also an OTB International Master.

In 1999, Garry Kasparov played a chess game &quot;Kasparov versus the World&quot; over the Internet, hosted by the MSN Gaming Zone. The &quot;World Team&quot; included participation of over 50,000 people from more than 75 countries, deciding their moves by plurality vote. The game lasted four months, with Kasparov playing &quot;g7&quot; on his 62nd move and announcing a forced checkmate in 28 moves. The World Team voters resigned on October 22. After the game Kasparov said &quot;It is the greatest game in the history of chess. The sheer number of ideas, the complexity, and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played.&quot;

<text>In computer science, in the field of databases, write–read conflict (also known as reading uncommitted data and dirty read), is a computational anomaly associated with interleaved execution of transactions. Specifically, a write–read conflict occurs when &quot;a transaction requests to write an entity, for which an unclosed transaction has already made a read request.&quot;

Given a schedule S

:formula_1

T2 could read a database object A, modified by T1 which hasn&#x27;t committed. This is a &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;inconsistent&quot; read.

T1 may write some value into A which makes the database inconsistent. It is possible that interleaved execution can expose this inconsistency and lead to an inconsistent final database state, violating ACID rules.

Strict 2PL overcomes this inconsistency by locking T2 out from performing a Read/Write on A. Note however that Strict 2PL can have a number of drawbacks, such as the possibility of deadlocks.

<text>Dame Edith Mary Evans (8 February 1888 – 14 October 1976) was an English actress. She was best known for her work on the West End stage, but also appeared in films at the beginning and towards the end of her career. Between 1964 and 1968, she was nominated for three Academy Awards.

Evans&#x27;s stage career spanned sixty years, during which she played more than 100 roles, in classics by Shakespeare, Congreve, Goldsmith, Sheridan and Wilde, and plays by contemporary writers including Bernard Shaw, Enid Bagnold, Christopher Fry and Noël Coward. She created roles in two of Shaw&#x27;s plays: Orinthia in &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; (1929), and Epifania in &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1940) and was in the British premières of two others: &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (1921) and &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot; (1923).

Evans became widely known for portraying haughty aristocratic women, as in two of her most famous roles as Lady Bracknell in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, and Miss Western in the 1963 film of &quot;Tom Jones.&quot; During her performance as Lady Bracknell, her elongated delivery of the line &#x27;A handbag&#x27; has become synonymous with the Oscar Wilde play. By contrast, she played a downtrodden maid in &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot; (1933), an eccentric, impoverished old woman in &quot;The Whisperers&quot; (1967) and – one of her most celebrated roles – Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, which she played in four productions between 1926 and 1961.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Evans was born in Pimlico, London, the daughter of Edward Evans, a junior civil servant in the General Post Office, and his wife, Caroline Ellen &quot;née&quot; Foster. She had one sibling, a brother who died at the age of four. She was educated at St Michael&#x27;s Church of England School, Pimlico, before being apprenticed at the age of 15 in 1903 as a milliner. She commented in later years that she loved the rich and beautiful materials of the craft, but could not manage to make two hats alike. While working in a milliner&#x27;s shop in the City she began attending drama classes in Victoria; the classes developed into an amateur performing group, the Streatham Shakespeare Players, with whom she made her first stage appearance in October 1910, as Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. In 1912, playing Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, she was spotted by the producer William Poel and made her first professional appearance for him in Cambridge in August of that year; she played Gautami in a 6th-century Hindu classic, &quot;Sakuntalá&quot;, in a cast including the young Nigel Playfair. Poel then cast her as Cressida in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; in London and subsequently at Stratford-upon-Avon. The critic of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; found her diction inadequate, but otherwise approved: &quot;Miss Edith Evans, who, without quite the invincible charm for Cressida, gave an interesting performance&quot;.
Evans&#x27;s West End debut was in George Moore&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth Cooper&quot; in 1913. The play received poor notices, but Evans was praised: &quot;In the very small part of a maid Miss Edith Evans made the success of the afternoon. She put more into her few minutes than most of our approved &#x27;stars&#x27; can suggest in leading parts.&quot; In January 1914 she made her professional Shakespearian debut as Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

In 1914, at Moore&#x27;s instigation, Evans was given a year&#x27;s contract by the Royalty Theatre in Soho. She played character roles in comedies, as a junior member of casts that included Gladys Cooper and Lynn Fontanne. Over the next ten years she polished her craft in a wide range of parts. She played in a silent film called &quot;A Welsh Singer&quot;, directed by and featuring Henry Edwards in 1915, and also had a minor role in another 1915 film, &quot;A Honeymoon for Three&quot;, starring Charles Hawtrey. She then appeared in &quot;East is East&quot; in 1917, but thereafter made no more films for over thirty years. She toured in Shakespeare with Ellen Terry&#x27;s company in 1918, appeared in light comedy alongside the young Noël Coward (&quot;Polly With a Past&quot;, 1921) and played five new Shavian roles, Lady Utterword in &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (1921) and the Serpent, the Oracle, the She-Ancient and the ghost of the Serpent in &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot; (1923). In 1922 she made what J. T. Grein in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; called &quot;a personal triumph&quot; in Alfred Sutro&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Laughing Lady&quot;.

===Stardom===

By this time Evans was well known to the critics, and frequently received excellent notices; with her performance as Millamant in &quot;The Way of the World&quot; in 1924 she achieved wide public fame for the first time. Nigel Playfair cast her as the strong-willed and witty heroine in his revival of Congreve&#x27;s Restoration comedy at the Lyric Hammersmith, in 1924. The critics resorted to superlatives:

James Agate wrote, &quot;Let me not mince matters. Miss Edith Evans is the most accomplished of living and practising English actresses.&quot; Arnold Bennett noted in his journals that this Millamant was the finest comedy performance he had ever seen. Her colleagues too were struck by the performance. John Gielgud recalled: 
In the 1925–26 season, Evans joined the company of the Old Vic, playing Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Cleopatra in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Katherina in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Mistress Page in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado&quot; and Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; – one of her most celebrated roles. The schedule of rehearsals and performances was hectic. She recalled, &quot;It was altogether a momentous season for me. I lost 17lb in weight and on the only free day from rehearsal ran off and got married.&quot; Her husband was George (Guy) Booth (1882 or 1883–1935), an engineer whom she had known for more than twenty years; there were no children. Marriage to someone unconnected with the theatre suited Evans, who did not share the taste of many of her colleagues for what Gielgud called &quot;publicity, gossip and backstage intrigue&quot;.

Looking back in 1976 at Evans&#x27;s career &quot;The Times&quot; observed that the two decades after her success as Millamant showed the range of her talent. The paper counted among her &quot;performances of absolute assurance&quot; in this period those in &quot;Tiger Cats&quot; (1924), &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot; (1927), &quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; (1929) in which she played Orinthia, the king&#x27;s mistress, a role written for her by Shaw. During the 1930s she played in several Broadway seasons, some productions transferred from London and others new. While she was in New York playing the Nurse opposite Katharine Cornell as Juliet, Evans&#x27;s husband died suddenly in London. She returned, devastated, and encouraged by colleagues found solace by throwing herself into her work.

Evans&#x27;s notable roles of the 1930s included Irela in &quot;Evensong&quot; (1932), Gwenny in &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot; (1933), four Shakespeare parts, and in 1939 Lady Bracknell in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. She played the last of these on and off for seven years, on tour and in London, and by 1947, when a Broadway run was offered, she declined to act in the piece again. She played Lady Bracknell on film (1952) and television (1960) but never again on the stage.

During the Second World War Evans joined an ENSA company travelling to Gibraltar to entertain Allied troops. The following year she played in a West End revival of &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, this time playing Hesione Hushabye. She toured for ENSA in Britain, Europe and India in 1944 and 1945. Returning to London, at the end of the war she played Mrs Malaprop in &quot;The Rivals&quot;. The production was not liked by the critics, and Evans&#x27;s performance drew respectful rather than ecstatic reviews.

===Postwar===
Evans played Shakespeare&#x27;s Cleopatra for the last time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her performance divided the critics: opinions varied from &quot;an agonising disaster&quot; to &quot;a joy to watch&quot;. Kenneth Tynan said, &quot;Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal&quot;. Evans had never been classically good looking, but she was a great enough actress to &quot;convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful&quot;. What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, &quot;I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality&quot;, which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character&#x27;s &quot;explicit admission of evil&quot;. Evans once remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth&quot;, a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, but &quot;isn&#x27;t she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her.&quot; This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, &quot;I know those sort of women. They ring the bell and tell you to put a lump of coal on the fire.&quot;
In 1948 Evans returned to the film studios after an absence of more than thirty years. At the instigation of Emlyn Williams she appeared in &quot;The Last Days of Dolwyn&quot;. The cast included Williams, Richard Burton, in his first film, and Allan Aynesworth, who had created the role of Algernon in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; in 1895. This was Aynesworth&#x27;s last film; Evans went on to make eighteen more over the next three decades. She played an elderly Welsh woman, and was well received by reviewers, although one wondered if she was yet quite at home before the camera: &quot;there are indeed moments when she looks as disproportionate as a life-size Rembrandt in a one-room flatlet. But it is not, of course, the flatlet which stays in the memory&quot;. In the same year she played Countess Ranevskaya in Thorold Dickinson&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;.

In the theatre, Evans returned to &quot;The Way of the World&quot; in 1948, exchanging the role of Millamant for that of the formidable old Lady Wishfort. The production received mixed notices, and Evans&#x27;s Wishfort – &quot;like a preposterous caricature of Queen Elizabeth&quot; – though much admired, overshadowed the rest of the cast. In November of the same year she made one of her rare appearances in Chekhov, as Ranevskaya in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. Her performance divided opinion: in &quot;The Observer&quot; Ivor Brown wrote of &quot;the glorious impact of an authentic genius at the highest level of world-theatre&quot;, but the anonymous reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; thought that she &quot;remains, a little mysteriously, outside of the character&quot;.

Over the next ten years Evans played in only six stage productions because she appeared in long-running West End plays. From March 1949 to November 1950 she appeared as Lady Pitts in &quot;Daphne Laureola&quot; in London and then New York. At the Haymarket she played Helen Lancaster in &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot;, which ran for more than two years. In April 1954 she played Countess Rosmarin Ostenburg in &quot;The Dark Is Light Enough&quot;, and at the Haymarket she was Mrs St Maugham in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; from April 1956 to November 1957. In May 1958 she returned to the Old Vic company, playing Queen Katharine in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; in London and then at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. At the same theatre in the 1959 season she played the Countess of Rousillon in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, and, despite her earlier words to Shaw, Volumnia in &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. In the 1950s she made three films, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952) - in which she famously gave an exaggerated delivery of the line &quot;A handbag?&quot; - &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959).

===1960s and 1970s===

In 1960 Evans played Judith Bliss in a television production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;. In the 1961 Stratford season Evans played Queen Margaret in &quot;Richard III&quot; and appeared for the last time as the Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. At the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in November 1963, she played Violet in &quot;Gentle Jack&quot; by Robert Bolt. In 1964 in a production for the National Theatre, she returned to the role of Judith Bliss in &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, heading a cast that in Coward&#x27;s words &quot;could play the Albanian telephone directory&quot;. Her films from the first half of the 1960s were &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; and &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (both made in 1964).
Her biggest film part of the 1960s was the central character, Mrs Ross, in &quot;The Whisperers&quot; (1967) for which she received an Oscar nomination and five major awards. After that her screen appearances were in supporting roles in ten more films. When she was 87 she played the Dowager Queen in &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; (1976), in which she sang and danced.

Evans&#x27;s last stage roles were Mrs Forrest in &quot;The Chinese Prime Minister&quot; at the Globe (1965), the Narrator in &quot;The Black Girl in Search of God&quot; at the Mermaid (1968), and Carlotta in &quot;Dear Antoine&quot;, Chichester Festival (1971). After she found learning new roles too much, she presented an anthology of prose, poetry and music under the title &quot;Edith Evans and Friends&quot;, both in the West End and elsewhere. In this show she made her final performance on the West End stage, on 5 October 1974. Her last public appearance was a BBC radio programme &quot;With Great Pleasure&quot;, a selection of her favourite works, given before an invited audience in August 1976. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Nicholas de Jongh wrote of her evident frailty, &quot;Yet she can still give the single words and phrases an imperious or serene grandeur, as in her final speaking of Richard Church&#x27;s poem where she welcomed &#x27;that summoning touch of death our neighbour&#x27;. What a glorious star is going out.&quot;

Bryan Forbes, who had directed Edith Evans in &quot;The Whisperers&quot; and &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;, wrote her biography &quot;Ned&#x27;s Girl&quot;, first published in 1977.

Evans died at her home in Cranbrook, Kent, on 14 October 1976, aged 88.

==Honours==
Evans was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) by King George VI in 1946.

Evans received honorary degrees from the universities of London (1950), Cambridge (1951), Oxford (1954) and Hull (1968).

Evans was painted by Walter Sickert as Katharina in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. For many years a sculpted head of Evans was on display at the Royal Court Theatre. In 1977 a portrait by Henry Glintenkamp was sold as part of her estate.

==Last resting place and memorial==
Evans&#x27;s ashes are interred at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, London. A blue plaque was unveiled outside her house at 109 Ebury Street, London, in 1997.

==Awards and nominations==

==Other film acting awards==

Edith Evans was cited as Best Supporting Actress by the National Board of Review (NBR) for &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; in 1959. The NBR also cited her as Best Supporting Actress for &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; in 1964 and as Best Actress for &quot;The Whisperers&quot; in 1967. Her role in &quot;The Whisperers&quot; also won her awards from the British Film Academy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and the New York Film Critics Circle.

<text>In computer science, in the field of databases, write–write conflict, also known as overwriting [[commit (data management)|uncommitted]] data is a computational anomaly associated with interleaved execution of transactions. Specifically, a write–write conflict occurs when &quot;transaction requests to write an entity for which an unclosed transaction has already made a write request.&quot;

Given a schedule S

formula_1

note that there is no read in this schedule. The writes are called blind writes.

We have a lost update. Any attempts to make this schedule serial would give off two different results (either T1&#x27;s version of A and B is shown, or T2&#x27;s version of A and B is shown), and would not be the same as the above schedule. This schedule would not be serializable.

Strict 2PL overcomes this inconsistency by locking T1 out from B. Unfortunately, deadlocks are something Strict 2PL does not overcome all the time.

<text>Yves Klein (; 28 April 1928 – 6 June 1962) was a French artist and an important figure in post-war European art. He was a leading member of the French artistic movement of Nouveau réalisme founded in 1960 by art critic Pierre Restany. Klein was a pioneer in the development of performance art, and is seen as an inspiration to and as a forerunner of minimal art, as well as pop art. He developed and used International Klein Blue.

==Biography==
Klein was born in Nice, in the Alpes-Maritimes department of France. His parents, Fred Klein and Marie Raymond, were both painters. His father painted in a loose post-impressionist style, while his mother was a leading figure in Art informel, and held regular soirées with other leading practitioners of this Parisian abstract movement. Klein received no formal training in art, but his parents exposed him to different styles. His father was a figurative style painter, while his mother had an interest in abstract expressionism.

From 1942 to 1946, Klein studied at the École Nationale de la Marine Marchande and the École Nationale des Langues Orientales. At this time, he became friends with Arman (Armand Fernandez) and Claude Pascal and started to paint. At the age of nineteen, Klein and his friends lay on a beach in the south of France, and divided the world between themselves; Arman chose the earth, Pascal, words, while Klein chose the ethereal space surrounding the planet, which he then proceeded to sign:

In early 1948, Klein was exposed to Max Heindel&#x27;s 1909 text &quot;The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception&quot; and pursued a membership with an American society dedicated to Rosicrucianism.

==Judo==
While attending the École Nationale des Langues Orientales Klein began practicing judo. During the years 1948 to 1952, he travelled to Italy, Great Britain, Spain, and Japan. He travelled to Japan in 1953 where he became, at the age of 25, a master at judo receiving the rank of &quot;yodan&quot; (4th &quot;dan&quot;/degree black-belt) from the Kodokan, becoming the first European to rise to that rank. Later that year, he became the technical director of the Spanish judo team. In 1954 Klein wrote a book on judo called &quot;Les Fondements du judo&quot;. The same year, he settled permanently in Paris and began in earnest to establish himself in the art world.

==Music==
Between 1947 and 1948, Klein conceived his &quot;Monotone Symphony&quot; (1949, formally &quot;Monotone Silence Symphony&quot;) that consisted of a single 20-minute sustained D major chord followed by a 20-minute silence – a precedent to Klein&#x27;s later monochrome paintings and to the work of minimal musicians, particularly La Monte Young&#x27;s drone music and John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4′33″&quot;.

The Symphony is rarely performed. Composer and performer Roland Dahinden said that &quot;You can’t really do a full rehearsal of something like this&quot; because &quot;It’s too hard. Everyone would just die.&quot; The first performance was in a Paris art gallery in 1960, with only ten performing musicians. Singer Sahra Motalebi described it as &quot;The reality is that it’s like a kind of bizarre primordial universe chorus. It’s not like a note you’ve ever heard.&quot; Klein himself compared the sound of his symphony to screams. For the first performance in Paris, Klein invited three naked women, whom he called &quot;living brushes&quot;, who &quot;covered themselves in his signature deep blue paint and pressed their bodies on paper during the sound half of the symphony, freezing during the silence&quot;.

==Artwork==
===Monochrome works: The Blue Epoch===

Although Klein had painted monochromes as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950, his first public showing was the publication of the artist&#x27;s book &quot;Yves Peintures&quot; in November 1954. Parodying a traditional catalogue raisonné, the book featured a series of intense monochromes linked to various cities he had lived in during the previous years. &quot;Yves Peintures&quot; anticipated his first two shows of oil paintings, at the Club des Solitaires, Paris, October 1955 and &quot;Yves: Proposition monochromes&quot; at Gallery Colette Allendy, February 1956. Public responses to these shows, which displayed orange, yellow, red, pink and blue monochromes, deeply disappointed Klein, as people went from painting to painting, linking them together as a sort of mosaic.

The next exhibition, &#x27;Proposte Monocrome, Epoca Blu&#x27; (Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch) at the Gallery Apollinaire, Milan, (January 1957), featured 11 identical blue canvases, using ultramarine pigment suspended in a synthetic resin &#x27;Rhodopas&#x27;, described by Klein as &quot;The Medium&quot;. Discovered with the help of Edouard Adam, a Parisian paint dealer, the optical effect retained the brilliance of the pigment which, when suspended in linseed oil, tended to become dull. Klein later deposited a Soleau envelope for this recipe to maintain the &quot;authenticity of the pure idea.&quot; This colour, reminiscent of the lapis lazuli used to paint the Madonna&#x27;s robes in medieval paintings, was to become known as International Klein Blue (IKB). The paintings were attached to poles placed away from the walls to increase their spatial ambiguities. All 11 of the canvases were priced differently. The buyers would go through the gallery, observing each canvas and purchase the one that was deemed best in their own eyes specifically. Klein&#x27;s idea was that each buyer would see something unique in the canvas that they bought that other buyers may not have seen. So while each painting visually looked the same, the impact each had on the buyer was completely unique.

The show was a critical and commercial success, traveling to Paris, Düsseldorf and London. The Parisian exhibition, at the Iris Clert Gallery in May 1957, became a seminal happening. To mark the opening, 1,001 blue balloons were released and blue postcards were sent out using IKB stamps that Klein had bribed the postal service to accept as legitimate. Concurrently, an exhibition of tubs of blue pigment and fire paintings was held at Galerie Collette Allendy.

===&quot;The Void&quot;===

For his next exhibition at the Iris Clert Gallery (April 1958), Klein chose to show nothing whatsoever, called (&quot;The Specialization of Sensibility in the Raw Material State into Stabilized Pictorial Sensibility, The Void&quot;): he removed everything in the gallery space except a large cabinet, painted every surface white, and then staged an elaborate entrance procedure for the opening night: the gallery&#x27;s window was painted blue, and a blue curtain was hung in the entrance lobby, accompanied by republican guards and blue cocktails. Thanks to an enormous publicity drive, 3,000 people queued up, waiting to be let into an empty room.

The art historian Olivier Berggruen situates Klein &quot;as one who strove for total liberation,&quot; forming connections between perverse ritual and a disdain of convention. Klein had studied judo in Japan between 1952 and 1954, and also displayed an interest in Zen Buddhism. According to Berggruen, he used ritual as a means not to attain belief, but rather as a forum through which to reach abstraction—transcending worldly vestiges temporarily, and returning to earth as a new being.


Later in the year, he was invited to decorate the Gelsenkirchen Opera House, Germany, with a series of vast blue murals, the largest of which were 20 metres by 7 metres. The Opera House was inaugurated in December 1959. Klein celebrated the commission by travelling to Cascia, Italy, to place an ex-voto offering at the Saint Rita Monastery. &quot;May all that emerges from me be beautiful,&quot; he prayed. The offering took the form of a small transparent plastic box containing three compartments; one filled with IKB pigment, one filled with pink pigment, and one with gold leaf inside. The container was only rediscovered in 1980.

Klein&#x27;s last two exhibitions at Iris Clert&#x27;s were &quot;Vitesse Pure et Stabilité Monochrome&quot; (&quot;Sheer Speed and Monochrome Stability&quot;), November 1958, a collaboration with Jean Tinguely, of kinetic sculptures, and (&quot;Bas-Reliefs in a Sponge Forest&quot;), June 1959, a collection of sponges that Klein had used to paint IKB canvases, mounted on steel rods and set in rocks that he&#x27;d found in his parents&#x27; garden.

===Anthropométries===
Despite the IKB paintings being uniformly coloured, Klein experimented with various methods of applying the paint; firstly different rollers and then later sponges, created a series of varied surfaces. This experimentalism would lead to a number of works Klein made using naked female models covered in blue paint and dragged across or laid upon canvases to make the image, using the models as &quot;living brushes&quot;. This type of work he called &quot;Anthropometry&quot;. Other paintings in this method of production include &quot;recordings&quot; of rain that Klein made by driving around in the rain at 70 miles per hour with a canvas tied to the roof of his car, and canvases with patterns of soot created by scorching the canvas with gas burners.

Klein and Arman were continually involved with each other creatively, both as Nouveaux Réalistes and as friends. Both from Nice, the two worked together for many years and Arman even named his son, Yves Arman, after Yves Klein, who was his godfather.

Sometimes the creation of these paintings was turned into a kind of performance art—an event in 1960, for example, had an audience dressed in formal evening wear watching the models go about their task while an instrumental ensemble played Klein&#x27;s 1949 &quot;The Monotone Symphony&quot;.

In the performance piece, &quot;Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle&quot; (&quot;Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility&quot;) 1959–1962, he offered empty spaces in the city in exchange for gold. He wanted his buyers to experience The Void by selling them empty space. In his view this experience could only be paid for in the purest material: gold. In exchange, he gave a certificate of ownership to the buyer. As the second part of the piece, performed on the Seine with an art critic in attendance, if the buyer agreed to set fire to the certificate, Klein would throw half the gold into the river, in order to restore the &quot;natural order&quot; that he had unbalanced by selling the empty space (that was now not &quot;empty&quot; anymore). He used the other half of the gold to create a series of gold-leafed works, which, along with a series of pink monochromes, began to augment his blue monochromes toward the end of his life.

===Leap into the Void===
Klein created a composite photograph, &quot;Saut dans le vide&quot; (&quot;Leap into the Void&quot;), originally published in his 1960 artist&#x27;s book &quot;Dimanche&quot;, which apparently shows him jumping off a wall, arms outstretched, towards the pavement. Klein used the photograph as evidence of his ability to undertake unaided lunar travel. In fact, &quot;Saut dans le vide&quot;, published as part of a broadside on the part of Klein (the &quot;artist of space&quot;) denouncing NASA&#x27;s own lunar expeditions as hubris and folly, was a photomontage in which the large tarpaulin, held by artist friends, Klein leaped onto was removed from the final image.

Klein&#x27;s work revolved around a Zen-influenced concept he came to describe as &quot;le Vide&quot; (the Void). Klein&#x27;s Void is a nirvana-like state that is void of worldly influences; a neutral zone where one is inspired to pay attention to one&#x27;s own sensibilities, and to &quot;reality&quot; as opposed to &quot;representation&quot;. Klein presented his work in forms that were recognized as art—paintings, a book, a musical composition—but then would take away the expected content of that form (paintings without pictures, a book without words, a musical composition without in fact composition) leaving only a shell, as it were. In this way he tried to create for the audience his &quot;Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility&quot;.
Instead of representing objects in a subjective, artistic way, Klein wanted his subjects to be represented by their imprint: the image of their absence.
He tried to make his audience experience a state where an idea could simultaneously be &quot;felt&quot; as well as &quot;understood&quot;.

===Multiples===
As well as painting flat canvases, Klein produced a series of works throughout his career that blurred the edges between painting and sculpture. He appropriated plaster casts of famous sculptures, such as the &quot;Winged Victory of Samothrace&quot; and the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, by painting them International Klein Blue; he painted a globe, 3D reliefs of areas of France and dowels which he hung from the ceiling as rain. He also stuck sponges to canvases and painted dinner plates. Many of these works were later manufactured as editioned multiples after his death.

In &quot;Blue Obelisk&quot;, a project that he had failed to realise in 1958, but that finally happened in 1983, he appropriated the Place de la Concorde by shining blue spotlights onto the central obelisk.

===Last years===
The art critic Pierre Restany, who spoke of how his first meeting with Klein had been fundamental to them both, went on to found the Nouveau Réalisme group with Klein in Klein&#x27;s studio/apartment on 27 October 1960. Founding members were Arman, Francois Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, Martial Raysse, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely, and Jacques Villeglé, with Niki de Saint Phalle, Christo and Gérard Deschamps joining later. Normally seen as a French version of Pop Art, the aim of the group was stated as &#x27;Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real&#x27; [&quot;Nouveau Réalisme nouvelles approches perceptives du réel&quot;].

A large retrospective was held at Krefeld, Germany, January 1961, followed by an unsuccessful opening at Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, in which Klein failed to sell a single painting. He stayed with Rotraut at the Chelsea Hotel for the duration of the exhibition; and, while there, he wrote the &quot;Chelsea Hotel Manifesto&quot;, a proclamation of the &quot;multiplicity of new possibilities.&quot; In part, the manifesto declared:

He moved on to exhibit at the Dwan Gallery, Los Angeles, and traveled extensively in the Western U.S., visiting Death Valley in the Mojave Desert. In 1962, Klein married Rotraut Uecker who gave birth to their son shortly after his death.

===Death===
Klein suffered a heart attack while watching the film &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; (in which he is featured) at the Cannes Film Festival on 11 May 1962. Two more heart attacks followed, the second of which killed him on 6 June 1962.

==Legacy==
Thomas McEvilley, in an essay submitted to &quot;Artforum&quot; in 1982, classified Klein as an early, though enigmatic, postmodernist artist.

A sort of parody of Klein&#x27;s &quot;Anthropometry&quot; performance is featured in the 1961 film &quot;Wise Guys&quot; (original title: &quot;Les Godelureaux&quot;) directed by Claude Chabrol.

The Yves Klein archive is housed in Phoenix, Arizona, where his widow Rotraut Klein-Moquay has a home.

On 8 December 2017, Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers released the lead single from their thirteenth studio album Resistance is Futile, International Blue. The song was inspired by Klein, particularly the titular International Klein Blue. The Manics&#x27; bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire told the Quietus &quot;&quot;There was a joy to &#x27;International Blue&#x27; that we weren&#x27;t sure we could convey any more, the feeling of being in love with something like Yves Klein, to pass on the joy of that colour and that vividness – we weren&#x27;t sure if we still had it in us. It sounds quite young.&quot;

In 2017, the MoMA- and WNYC-produced contemporary art podcast &quot;A Piece of Work&quot; hosted by Abbi Jacobson had an episode focused on Klein&#x27;s blue monochromes. In 2018, the podcast &quot;This is Love&quot; released an episode, &quot;Blue,&quot; about Klein and his work.

A 2021 short novel, &quot;Blue Postcards&quot; by Douglas Bruton, is built around the life and art of Yves Klein.

==Art market==
Alongside works by Andy Warhol and Willem de Kooning, Klein&#x27;s painting &quot;RE 46&quot; (1960) was among the top-five sellers at Christie&#x27;s Post-War and Contemporary Art sale in May 2006. His monochromatic blue sponge painting sold for $4,720,000. Previously, his painting &quot;RE I&quot; (1958) had sold for $6,716,000 at Christie&#x27;s New York in November 2000. In 2008, &quot;MG 9&quot; (1962), a monochromatic gold painting, sold for $21 million at Christie&#x27;s. &quot;FC1 (Fire Color 1)&quot; (1962), a nearly -long panel created with a blowtorch, water and two models, sold for $36,482,500 at Christie&#x27;s on 8 May 2012. The record for the most expensive of his paintings was reached by &quot;Le Rose du Bleu (RE 22)&quot;, who sold by $36,753,200 at Christie&#x27;s London, on 27 June 2012.

In 2013, Klein&#x27;s &quot;Sculpture Éponge Bleue Sans Titre, SE 168&quot;, a 1959 sculpture made with natural sea sponges drenched in blue pigment, fetched $22 million, the highest price paid for a sculpture by the artist, at Sotheby&#x27;s New York.

<text>The Whisperers is a 1967 British drama film directed by Bryan Forbes and starring Edith Evans. It is based on the 1961 novel by Robert Nicolson. 

== Plot ==
Mrs Margaret Ross, an impoverished, elderly, eccentric woman, is living in a ground floor flat, and hears voices of whom she asks &quot;are you there&quot; - the whisperers of the title, in an unnamed town in northern England. Aged 76, she is dependent on National Assistance from the British government. She is visited by her criminal son, who hides a package containing a large sum of money in her unused spare room. The son confesses to the police of his robbery, then is sent to jail. Meanwhile, Mrs Ross finds the money. Thinking the money is a windfall intended for her, Mrs Ross makes elaborate plans. She casually confides to a stranger, who befriends her in order to ply her with spirits, kidnap her, then rob her of the stolen money. Rendered drunk and abandoned to the elements by her captors, Mrs Ross contracts pneumonia. She is found by neighbours, then after almost dying, recovers in a hospital. It is the first time anyone has cared for her in years. Doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, and social workers all focus on her case. An agent at the National Assistance bureau traces down her husband, Archie (who deserted her decades ago). Motivated by the agent, who threatens him with legal pressure, informing him of his legal responsibility to her, the husband is strongly encouraged to move back in with her, which he does. Soon, he becomes involved with gamblers, then steals their money at a chance opportunity, which forces him to flee, so he deserts her again. Having been on the verge of a return to functional living, Mrs Ross resumes her life living by herself. Her voices went away during the middle of the film, but when she returns she asks the whisperers again, if they are there. This movie depicts these events as occurring during the year 1966, the year that British National Assistance was replaced by Supplementary Benefit.

<doc id="217752" wikidata="Q5437028" url="?curid=217752" title="Fast Day">
<text>Fast Day was a holiday observed in some parts of the United States between 1670 and 1991.

&quot;A day of public fasting and prayer,&quot; it was traditionally observed in the New England states. It had its origin in days of prayer and repentance proclaimed in the early days of the British American colonies by Royal Governors, to avoid such calamities as plagues, natural disasters or crop failures; it was common to hold a Fast Day before the spring planting (cf. rogation days). It was observed by church attendance, fasting, and abstinence from secular activities.

A Fast Day could be added for any particular reason in a particular year, rather than being instituted as an ongoing annual holiday. The earliest known Fast Day was proclaimed in colonial Boston, held on September 8, 1670. The colonial Province of New Hampshire proclaimed a Fast Day for February 26, 1680, seeking &quot;God&#x27;s blessing&quot; on an upcoming General Assembly and for good weather during spring planting. The following year, when illness struck John Cutt, the president of the Province of New Hampshire, and a comet was seen in the sky, the province designated March 17, 1681 a Fast Day in response to these signs of &quot;divine displeasure&quot;. The image at right shows that Jonathan Belcher, colonial governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, declared a Fast Day in 1735 because of &quot;the holy Anger of Almighty God, evidently manifested in the various judgments inflicted on us&quot;, specifically highlighting a &quot;mortal sickness&quot; that had been divinely inflicted on the colonists.

Fast Day had lost its significance as a religious holiday by the late 19th century. It was abolished by Massachusetts in 1894, when that state replaced their Fast Day, celebrated on the third Monday in April, with Patriots&#x27; Day, commemorating the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the Battle of Menotomy on the first day (April 19, 1775) of the American Revolutionary War. Maine, which also celebrated Fast Day on the third Monday in April, changed it to Patriot&#x27;s Day in 1907. Fast Day continued in New Hampshire until 1991, with the late April holiday signifying only the opening of the summer tourist season; the state dropped Fast Day in 1991, replacing it with the January Civil Rights Day, which they renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Day (the last U.S. state to do so) in 1999.

<doc id="217754" wikidata="Q59776" url="?curid=217754" title="Church of Cyprus">
<text>The Church of [[Cyprus]] () is one of the autocephalous Greek Orthodox churches that together with other Eastern Orthodox churches form the communion of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is one of the oldest Eastern Orthodox autocephalous churches; it claims to have always been independent, although it may have been subject to the Church of Antioch before its autocephaly was recognized in 431 at the Council of Ephesus. The bishop of the ancient capital, Salamis (renamed &quot;Constantia&quot; by Emperor Constantius II) was constituted metropolitan by Emperor Zeno, with the title &quot;archbishop&quot;.

==History==
===Roman era===
According to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul of Tarsus converted the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus, (), making him the first Christian ruler, and thus Cyprus became the first country ruled by a Christian leader.

A few of the bishops who helped spread Christianity on the island were Lazarus, the Bishop of Kition, Herakleidios the Bishop of Tamasos, Avxivios the Bishop of Soloi, and Theodotos the Bishop of Kyrenia.

Towards the end of the fourth century, Christianity had spread throughout the island. During this time St. Epiphanius was Archbishop. His seat was in Salamis, which was renamed Constantia.

===Byzantine era===
This independent (autocephalous) position by ancient custom was recognized against the claims of the Patriarch of Antioch, at the Council of Ephesus (431); it is unclear if the Church of Cyprus has always been independent or if it was once part of the Church of Antioch. When the Patriarch of Antioch claimed the Church of Cyprus was under its jurisdiction, the Cypriot clergy denounced this before the Council of Ephesus. The Council ratified the autocephaly of the Church of Cyprus by a resolution which conditionally states: &quot;If, as it is asserted in memorials and orally by the religious men who have come before the Council - it has not been a continuous ancient custom for the bishop of Antioch to hold ordinations in Cyprus, - the prelates of Cyprus shall enjoy, free from molestation and violence, their right to perform by themselves the ordination of bishops [for their island]&quot;. After the Council of Ephesus, the Church of Antioch never claimed that Cyprus was under its jurisdiction. This independence was also recognized by an edict of Emperor Zeno.

In 478, Archbishop Anthemios of Cyprus claimed that following a vision he had found the grave of Barnabas and his relics. On the saint&#x27;s chest rested a copy of the Gospel of Matthew. The church was thus able to send a cogent argument on its own behalf to the Emperor: the discovery of the relics of its reputed founder, Barnabas. Zeno confirmed the status of the Church of Cyprus and granted its Archbishop the &quot;three privileges&quot;: namely to sign his name in an ink made vermilion by the addition of cinnabar; to wear tyrian purple instead of black robes under his vestments; and to hold an imperial sceptre (i.e. a gilt staff of silver, topped by a gold globus cruciger) instead of the regular episcopal crosier.

Cyprus suffered greatly from Arab invasions in the following centuries, and during the reign of Justinian II the cities of Constantia, Kourion and Paphos were sacked. At the advice of the Emperor, the Archbishop fled to the Dardanelles along with the survivors, and established the city of Nova Justiniana (, &quot;Néa Iustinianē&quot;), named after the Emperor, at Erdek near the city of Cyzicus. In 692 the Quinisext Council reconfirmed the status and privileges of the exiled Archbishop and in 698, when the Arabs were driven out of Cyprus, the Archbishop returned but retained the title of &quot;Archbishop of Nova Justiniana and All Cyprus&quot;: a custom that, along with the &quot;three privileges&quot;, continues to this day.

===Crusader era===
After the establishment of the Kingdom of Cyprus, the Catholic kings gradually reduced the number of Orthodox bishops from 14 to 4 and forced those away from their towns. The archbishop was moved from Nicosia to the region of Solia, near Morphou, the bishop of Larnaca was moved to the village of Lefkara etc. Each Orthodox bishop was under the Catholic bishop of the area. The Catholic Church tried on occasion to coax the Orthodox bishops to make concessions on the differences in doctrine and practices between the two churches, sometimes with threats and sometimes using violence and torture, as in the case of the 13 monks at Kantara monastery. Moreover, the properties of many monasteries were confiscated. The persecutions, especially during the Frankish period, did not succeed in uprooting the faith of the Greek Cypriots.

Despite initial frictions, the two churches gradually managed to coexist side by side peacefully. The local Orthodox Christians shared some of the benefits of the economic development of Cyprus and especially Famagusta at the time. The Orthodox cathedral of St George (known as &quot;Saint George of the Greeks&quot; – today in ruins) is almost as high and monumental as the nearby Catholic cathedral of St Nicholas (a mosque since 1571), and is also an example of an interesting fusion of gothic and Byzantine architecture.

The Franks were succeeded by the Venetians in 1489 without any significant change to the status of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

===Cypriot independence===
In 1950, Makarios III was elected Archbishop. While still Bishop of Kition he had demonstrated strong intellectual and national activity. In 1949 he founded the Apostle Varnavas Seminary, and in 1950 he organised the referendum on the Union (&quot;Enosis&quot;) between Cyprus and Greece. While archbishop he was the political leader of the EOKA liberation struggle in the years 1955–1959. The British exiled him to the Seychelles because of his activities.

In 1960, Archbishop Makarios III was elected President of the newly established republic of Cyprus. Disagreements of the other three bishops with Makarios led to the 1972–73 Cypriot ecclesiastical coup attempt. Following the dethronement of the Bishops of Paphos, Kitium and Kyrenia for conspiring against Makarios, two new Bishoprics were created: the Bishopric of Limassol which was detached from the Bishopric of Kition, and the Bishopric of Morfou which was detached from the Bishopric of Kyrenia. The coup d&#x27;état of 15 July 1974 forced Archbishop Makarios III to leave the island. He returned in December 1974.

===Turkish invasion===
The coup d&#x27;état was followed by the Turkish invasion of 20 July 1974 which significantly affected the church and its flock: as 35% of Cyprus&#x27; territory came under Turkish occupation, hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Christians were displaced and those that could not or did not want to leave (20,000 initially) faced oppression. As of May 2001 figures only 421 Greek Orthodox Cypriots and 155 Maronites remain in North Cyprus.

The destruction of Christian monuments was another important consequence. Churches containing Byzantine icons, frescoes and mosaics have been pillaged by antiquities dealers and sold on the black market. One of the most prominent cases of pillage was of the mosaics of Panagia of Kanakaria of the 6th century AD, which were finally returned to the Church of Cyprus, following rulings by federal courts in Indianapolis and Chicago. In Northern Cyprus, there are 514 churches, chapels and monasteries, many of which were converted to mosques, museums or abandoned.

===Recent events===
On 3 August 1977, Makarios III died and was succeeded by Archbishop Chrysostomos I. In 1979, the new Statutory Charter of the Church of Cyprus was drawn up and approved replacing the old one of 1914.

In old age, Archbishop Chrysostomos suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and was unable to carry out his duties for a number of years. In May 2006, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I chaired a broader meeting of church elders which called for Chrysostomos&#x27; &quot;honorary removal&quot;.

Metropolitan Chrysostomos of Paphos, 65, was elected the new archbishop on 5 November 2006, after a long-running election campaign, becoming Archbishop Chrysostomos II, Archbishop of Nea Justiniana and All Cyprus.

After the death of Chrysostomos II, the 2022 Cypriot archiepiscopal election was called to choose his successor.

==Administration and Holy Synod==

The Holy Synod of the Church of Cyprus is the highest church authority in Cyprus. Its task is to examine and provide solutions on all issues concerning the Church of Cyprus. Head of the Holy Synod and of the Church of Cyprus is Georgios III Papachrysostomou, Archbishop of New Justiniana and All Cyprus.

==Religious sites in Cyprus==
*Nine Byzantine churches in the Troödos mountains are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites, pictured here.
*Kykkos Monastery, guardians of the holy Kykkotissa Icon, an unusual representation of the infant Jesus kicking with joy on his mother&#x27;s lap.
*Icons smuggled from the Bishopric of the Holy Metropolis of Kyrenia and Church of Panaghia Asinou in the northern Turkish-occupied part of the island were repatriated by a collector in the United States of America in 2007.
*Icons from Kalopanayiotis village stolen even earlier, before the division of the island, have also been returned to the Church&#x27;s custody.
*Some estimate that since 1974 looters have stripped an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 icons; several dozen major frescoes and mosaics dating from the sixth to the fifteenth century; and thousands of chalices, wooden carvings, crucifixes, and Bibles. Efforts by the Autocephalous Church of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus to return some of these objects are described in a 1998 issue of Archeology magazine but the majority remain lost.
*Churches in capital Nicosia such as Chrysaliniotissa &quot;Our Lady of the Golden Flax&quot;, Panayia Chrysospiliotissa &quot;Our Lady of the Gold Cave&quot; and the Archangel Michael Trypiotis Church, along with the Byzantine Museum of the Archbishop Makarios III Foundation, listed for interested visitors

<text>Wait Until Dark is a play by Frederick Knott, first performed on Broadway in 1966 and often revived since then. A film version was released in 1967, and the play was published in the same year.

==Synopsis==
Susy Hendrix is a blind Greenwich Village housewife who becomes the target of three con-men searching for the heroin hidden in a doll, which her husband Sam unwittingly transported from Canada as a favor to a woman who has since been murdered. &quot;Roat&quot; leads his companions into thinking that they are going to be rich and will get the heroin soon enough, but in the end he murders all of his partners after they outlive their usefulness.

The trio tries to convince Susy that her husband will be suspected of murdering the woman, and the only way to protect him is to give them the doll, which connects him to her. Little do the men know that Gloria, a little girl in the upstairs apartment, has stolen the doll after finding out it was not a gift for her.

One of the men poses as Sergeant Carlino, a strange police detective, while another poses as Mike, an old friend of her husband dropping by for a visit. Susy relies on &quot;Mike&quot;, and he eventually begins to feel sympathy for her.

&quot;Roat&quot; poses as both the elderly Mr. Roat and his &quot;son&quot;, Roat Junior. Roat Senior ransacks Susy&#x27;s room and steals a wedding photo from the bedroom. He threatens Susy&#x27;s and her husband&#x27;s well-being, so she calls the police. Her call is intercepted by &quot;Mike&quot;, and Susy is visited by &quot;Sergeant Carlino&quot;.

Gloria returns and admits her theft of the doll, and Susy hides it. Susy contacts &quot;Mike&quot; to ask for help now that the doll is found. Gloria has been watching the nearby phone booth used by the con-men, and she alerts Susy that all three of the men she has been dealing with are tricking her. Susy sends Gloria to meet her husband on his way home from work, and begins planning to handle the intruders.

Roat kills both of his partners after the men discover Susy has the doll in the apartment. He spills gas around the apartment to destroy any evidence.

Susy turns off all the lights so that &quot;Roat&quot; cannot see her. &quot;Roat&quot; uses matches to see until Susy douses him with the gasoline. He uses the refrigerator light to see, threatens Susy, and tries to kill her. She ultimately defeats &quot;Roat&quot;.

Sam bursts in with the police and finds that Susy has already dealt with Roat. He sees that Mike is also dead. Gloria yells at the police when they appear too patronizing to Susy and defends Susy&#x27;s ability to take care of herself. After the police leave, Susy and Sam embrace.

==Productions==
===Original===
Produced by Fred Coe and directed by Arthur Penn, the Broadway premiere of &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; opened on February 2, 1966, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Within the next 11 months, it transferred to the Shubert, the George Abbott and the Music Box Theatre, running for 373 performances.

* Lee Remick as Susy Hendrix
* Robert Duvall as Harry Roat Jr.
* Mitchell Ryan as Mike Talman
* Val Bisoglio as Sgt. Carlino
* James Congdon as Sam Hendrix
* Julie Herrod as Gloria

Remick was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

The West End production, with Honor Blackman and Peter Sallis, at the Strand Theatre, was also successful, running for nearly two years, during which time Barbara Murray and Lana Morris took over from Blackman in the lead.

===Revivals===
The play was produced by the Brunton Theatre Company, Musselburgh, under the direction of Sandy Neilson during its first season in 1979.

After 11 previews, a Broadway revival directed by Leonard Foglia opened on April 5, 1998, at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, where it ran for 97 performances. The cast included Marisa Tomei, Quentin Tarantino and Stephen Lang.

A 2003 London revival, followed by a UK tour, featured Susie Amy, Derren Nesbitt and Michael Melia. The setting was changed to Notting Hill.

A production of the play took place at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2010. It was performed at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh by students of Oxford University.

On October 16, 2013, a revised version by Jeffrey Hatcher opened at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, featuring Allison Pill, Adam Stein, and Mather Zickel. The story was backdated to 1944, and Sam and Mike are supposedly Marine buddies who served together in Italy.

==Adaptations==
Warner Bros.-Seven Arts purchased the film rights in 1966 soon after the play&#x27;s Broadway premiere. The film, directed by Terence Young with a screenplay by Robert Carrington and Jane Howard-Carrington and a score by Henry Mancini, premiered on October 26, 1967. It starred Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Jack Weston, and Julie Herrod, and it was produced by Hepburn&#x27;s then-husband Mel Ferrer.

In an effort to duplicate the suspense on screen, movie theaters dimmed their lights to their legal limits, then turned off one by one until each light on-screen was shattered, resulting in the theater being plunged into complete darkness.

Hepburn was nominated for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress, and Zimbalist was nominated for a Golden Globe in the supporting category.

The film ranked tenth on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; for its climactic scene, and it was ranked 55th on the list of American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

A 1982 TV movie starred Katharine Ross and Stacy Keach.

The movie was adapted into a 1986 Kannada-language movie &quot;27 Mavalli Circle&quot;.

<doc id="217756" wikidata="Q2418422" url="?curid=217756" title="Panic of 1893">
<text>The Panic of 1893 was an economic depression in the United States. It began in February 1893 and officially ended eight months later, but the effects from it continued to be felt until 1897. It was the most serious economic depression in history until the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Panic of 1893 deeply affected every sector of the economy and produced political upheaval that led to the political realignment and the presidency of William McKinley.

== Causes ==

The Panic of 1893 has been traced to many causes, one of them pointing to Argentina; investment was encouraged by the Argentine agent bank, Baring Brothers. However, the 1890 wheat crop failure and a failed coup in Buenos Aires ended further investments. In addition, speculations in South African and Australian properties also collapsed. Because European investors were concerned that these problems might spread, they started a run on gold in the U.S. Treasury. Specie was considered more valuable than paper money; when people were uncertain about the future, they hoarded specie and rejected paper notes.

During the Gilded Age of the 1870s and 1880s, the United States had experienced economic growth and expansion, but much of this expansion depended on high international commodity prices. Exacerbating the problems with international investments, wheat prices crashed in 1893. In particular, the opening of numerous mines in the western United States led to an oversupply of silver, leading to significant debate as to how much of the silver should be coined into money (see below). During the 1880s, American railroads experienced what might today be called a &quot;bubble&quot;: investors flocked to railroads, and they were greatly over-built.

One of the first clear signs of trouble came on 20 February 1893, twelve days before the inauguration of U.S. President Grover Cleveland, with the appointment of receivers for the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which had greatly overextended itself. Upon taking office, Cleveland dealt directly with the Treasury crisis and convinced Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he felt was mainly responsible for the economic crisis.

As concern for the state of the economy deepened, people rushed to withdraw their money from banks, and caused bank runs. The credit crunch rippled through the economy. A financial panic in London combined with a drop in continental European trade caused foreign investors to sell American stocks to obtain American funds backed by gold.

The economic policies of President Benjamin Harrison have been characterized as a contributing factor to the depression.

== Populists ==

The People&#x27;s Party, also known as the &#x27;Populists&#x27;, was an agrarian-populist political party in the United States. From 1892 to 1896, it played a major role as a left-wing force in American politics. It drew support from angry farmers in the West and South. It was highly critical of capitalism, especially banks and railroads, and allied itself with the labor movement.

Established in 1891 as a result of the Populist movement, the People&#x27;s Party reached its height in the 1892 presidential election, when its ticket, consisting of James B. Weaver and James G. Field, won 8.5% of the popular vote and carried five states (Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, and North Dakota), and the 1894 House of Representatives elections when it won nine seats. Built on a coalition of poor, white cotton farmers in the South (especially North Carolina, Alabama and Texas) and hard-pressed wheat farmers in the Plains States (especially Kansas and Nebraska), the Populists represented a radical form of agrarianism and hostility to elites, cities, banks, railroads, and gold.

==Silver==

The Free Silver movement arose from a synergy of farming and mining interests. Farmers sought to invigorate the economy and thereby end deflation, which was forcing them to repay loans with increasingly expensive dollars. Mining interests sought the right to turn silver directly into money without a central minting institution. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, while falling short of the Free Silver movement&#x27;s goals, required the U.S. government to buy millions of ounces of silver above what was required by the 1878 Bland–Allison Act (driving up the price of silver and pleasing silver miners). People attempted to redeem silver notes for gold. Ultimately, the statutory limit for the minimum amount of gold in federal reserves was reached and U.S. notes could no longer be redeemed for gold. Investments during the time of the panic were heavily financed through bond issues with high-interest payments. Rumors regarding financial distress at the National Cordage Company (NCC), then the most actively traded stock, caused its lenders to call in their loans immediately, and the company went into bankruptcy receivership as a result. The company, a rope manufacturer, had tried to corner the market for imported hemp. As demand for silver and silver notes fell, the price and value of silver dropped. Holders worried about a loss of face value of bonds, and many became worthless.

A series of bank failures followed, and the Northern Pacific Railway, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad failed. This was followed by the bankruptcy of many other companies; in total over 15,000 companies and 500 banks, many of them in the West, failed. According to high estimates, about of the workforce was unemployed at the panic&#x27;s peak. The huge spike in unemployment, combined with the loss of life savings kept in failed banks, meant that a once-secure middle-class could not meet their mortgage obligations. Many walked away from recently built homes as a result.

==Effects==
As a result of the panic, stock prices declined. Five hundred banks closed, 15,000 businesses failed, and numerous farms ceased operation. The unemployment rate hit 25% in Pennsylvania, 35% in New York, and 43% in Michigan. Soup kitchens were opened to help feed the destitute. Facing starvation, people chopped wood, broke rocks, and sewed by hand with needle and thread in exchange for food. In some cases, women resorted to prostitution to feed their families. To help the people of Detroit, Mayor Hazen S. Pingree launched his &quot;Potato Patch Plan&quot;, which were community gardens for farming.

President Grover Cleveland was blamed for the depression. Gold reserves stored in the U.S. Treasury fell to a dangerously low level. This forced President Cleveland to borrow $65 million in gold from Wall Street banker J.P. Morgan and the Rothschild banking family of England, through what was known as the Morgan-Belmont Syndicate His party suffered enormous losses in the 1894 elections, largely being blamed for the downward spiral in the economy and the brutal crushing of the Pullman Strike. After their defeat in 1896, the Democrats did not regain control of any branch of the Federal Government until 1910.

A rarely talked-about effect is the Love Canal disaster. People who were earlier keen to invest in the Love Canal stopped doing so, which led to the abandonment of its construction. Ultimately the canal ended up being a large toxic waste repository, with severe negative environmental effects. Love Canal remains synonymous with environmental pollution and degradation.

===Shipping===

The Panic of 1893 affected many aspects of the shipping industry, both by rail and maritime. It arrested the acquisition of ships and rolling stock and depressed shipping rates.

====Fluctuations in railroad investment after the Panic of 1893====
The bad omen of investors switching from equity based stocks to constant return bonds in 1894 was mirrored in the corporate finance actions of railroads which reduced their acquisition of rolling stock. Railroad expansion including capital expenditures rose again in 1895, but slowed in 1897 during another economic trough.

====Receivership====
In 1893, the total railroad mileage in the U.S. was 176,803.6 miles. In 1894 and 1895, railroads only expanded 4,196.4 miles, although 100,000 miles of rail was added from 1878 to 1896. In 1893, the year following the panic, one fourth of all rail mileage went into receivership. The U.S. Census placed this value at close to $1.8 billion (not adjusted for inflation), the largest amount recorded between 1876 and 1910. This was over $1 billion (also not adjusted for inflation) more than the next largest amount, in 1884.

====Pullman Strike====
In 1894, the U.S. Army intervened during a strike in Chicago to prevent property damage. The Pullman Strike began at the Pullman Company in Chicago after Pullman refused to either lower rent in the company town or raise wages for its workers due to increased economic pressure from the Panic of 1893. Since the Pullman Company was a railroad car company, this only increased the difficulty of acquiring rolling stock.

====American merchant tonnage====
The maritime industry of the United States did not escape the effects of the Panic of 1893. The total gross registered merchant marine tonnage employed in &quot;foreign and coastwise trade and in the fisheries&quot;, as measured by the U.S. Census between 1888 and 1893, grew at a rate of about 2.74%. In 1894, U.S. gross tonnage decreased by 2.9%, and again in 1895 by 1.03%.

====Rates====
In 1894, the rate for a bushel of wheat by rail dropped from 14.70¢ in 1893 to 12.88¢. This rate continued to decrease, reaching a terminal rate in 1901 of 9.92¢ and never reached 12 cents between 1898 and 1910.

Between 1893 and 1894, average shipping rates by lake or canal per wheat bushel decreased by almost 2 cents, from 6.33¢ to 4.44¢. Rates on the transatlantic crossing from New York City to Liverpool also decreased, from 2 and 3/8 pence to 1 and 15/16 pence, but this reflected a continuing trend downward from a high of 3 and 1/8 pence in 1891.

== The Morgan-Belmont Syndicate ==
In February 1895, the U.S. Government turned to private financial institutions to underwrite the sale of Treasury bonds, stabilize exchange rates, and return the Treasury to its gold reserve requirement. The result was a contract drawn with what was called &quot;The Morgan-Belmont Syndicate&quot;.

The persistent balance of payments deficit in the 1890s which drained the Treasury gold reserves, caused concern from both domestic and foreign investors that the U.S. would abandon the gold standard. This prompted further gold withdrawals and bond liquidations which exacerbated the deficit. By February 2, 1895, the Treasury&#x27;s gold reserves fell to approximately $42 million, well below the $100 million level required by the Resumption Act of 1875. After a series of failed attempts to restore reserves by issuing bonds and depreciating specie issued for legal tender, the Treasury negotiated a contract with the Morgan-Belmont Syndicate to restore confidence in the government&#x27;s ability to maintain the convertibility of legal tender into gold.

The full list of syndicate members was not made public, however the contract named Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., A. Belmont &amp; Co., J. S. Morgan &amp; Co., and N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons. The syndicate achieved its goals through a combination of purchasing gold from smelters, convincing its members to purchase Treasury bonds with gold, inspiring confidence in bond and railroad securities investors, and unofficial capital controls by convincing members and gold-exporting houses to &quot;ship no gold&quot; overseas.

<text>The Subject Was Roses is a Pulitzer Prize-winning 1964 play written by Frank D. Gilroy, who also adapted the work in 1968 for a film with the same title.

==Synopsis==
Timmy Cleary returns home from his service during World War II. While he seems to vindicate himself in his father&#x27;s eyes for surviving the war, his drinking and cursing disturb his mother. Though his parents, John and Nettie, seem to be happy, the peace proves to be a facade. Soon old emotional wounds and unresolved marital problems resurface. Caught in the middle, Timmy feels responsible for their squabbling, but can see no way to resolve their problems.

==Production==
The play premiered on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on May 25, 1964, starring Jack Albertson, Irene Dailey, and Martin Sheen, and directed by Ulu Grosbard. A major critical and commercial success, the play ran 832 performances and was nominated for five Tony Awards, winning two: Best Play and Best Featured Actor (Albertson). For his work in the play, Gilroy won the year&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Columbia Records recorded the complete play in a recording studio with the original cast members and released it as a double-LP set.

In the published script, Gilroy included a day-by-day journal he titled, &quot;About Those Roses or How &#x27;Not&#x27; To Do a Play and Succeed&quot;. According to the journal, &quot;&quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; opened on Broadway with a producer who had never produced a Broadway play; a director who had never directed one; a scenic artist who had never designed one; a general manager who had never managed one; and three actors who were virtually unknown.&quot; Additionally, the play opened &quot;after&quot; all of the award deadlines, so it was not eligible until the following year, triumphing over Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, Murray Schisgal&#x27;s &quot;Luv&quot; and Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Tiny Alice&quot; for the Tony Award, the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. During the play&#x27;s two-year run, &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; played five different Broadway theaters and Dustin Hoffman became a replacement stage manager and understudied the role of Timmy.

In 1991, the Roundabout Theatre Company revived the play in New York City with John Mahoney, Dana Ivey and Patrick Dempsey. A 2006 revival of the play was produced by Jeffrey Finn at the Kennedy Center starring Bill Pullman, Judith Ivey, and Steve Kazee. All three performers were nominated for 2007 Helen Hayes Awards. In a 2009 revival in Los Angeles, Martin Sheen again appeared, this time in the role of the father.

<text>Mary Antoinette &quot;Tony&quot; Perry (June 27, 1888June 28, 1946) was an American actress, producer, director and administrator, known for her work in theatre, she was co-founder and secretary of the American Theatre Wing and is the namesake of the Tony Awards, presented by that organization for excellence in Broadway theatre.

==Early life==
Born in Denver, Colorado, she spent her childhood aspiring to replicate the thespian artistry of her aunt and uncle, Mildred Hall and George Wessels, who were both well-respected touring actors. She performed at the Elitch Theater near Denver when she was only 11 years old. In her biography, Mary Elitch recalled, &quot;Her first public appearance was at the age of eleven in a small part on my stage. Today, with a brilliant career as an actress behind her, having played leading women with such great actors as David Warfield, Antoinette is a successful producer in New York City – having her own theatre.&quot;

Perry&#x27;s father, William Perry, was opposed to his daughter becoming an actress, but he was not against her pursuing a career in music, so sent her to Miss Ely&#x27;s School in New York to study voice and piano.

Perry made her actual stage debut at Elitch Theatre &quot;on June 12, 1904 in Olympe as the &#x27;Fifth Actress&#x27;.&quot; In June 1905 she made her Chicago debut in &quot;Mrs. Temple&#x27;s Telegram&quot; and one year later she appeared in the same play in her New York debut.

In 1906 David Warfield discovered her, and she remained with his company as leading lady until 1909. Perry was able to return to her hometown theatre in Denver during the 1908 Elitch Theatre season with David Warfield, Marie Bates, William Elliot and others in the preseason special productions of The Music Master and David Belasco&#x27;s The Grand Army Man.

She appeared opposite David Warfield in &quot;Music Master&quot; in 1906 when she was only 18.

Her career was on the rise, yet she left the stage a star in 1909, to marry Denver businessman and president of the Denver Gas and Electric Company, Frank W. Frueauff.

==Career==
Following Frank Frueauff&#x27;s death in 1922 of a heart attack, Perry returned to the stage. In 1924 she appeared in Zona Gale&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Pitt&quot;. She appeared notably in George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Minick&quot; that same year. She took up directing in 1928. In partnership with Brock Pemberton she produced several successful plays, including: &quot;Divorce Me Dear&quot;, &quot;Ceiling Zero&quot;, &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot;, &quot;Personal Appearance&quot; (Lawrence Riley&#x27;s breakthrough hit), &quot;Kiss the Boys Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Janie.&quot; Their most famous production was probably the Pulitzer Prize-winning Mary Chase classic &quot;Harvey&quot;, which Perry directed and which enjoyed enormous success on Broadway and as a film starring James Stewart.
According to Ellis Nassour:
:Perry became a stage director at a time when women working offstage in the theater were often relegated to positions as costumers or dressers. She established herself as a director with Preston Sturges in &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot; in 1929, in which her daughter Margaret debuted. “Tony was a gifted and versatile actress, and one of the best directors the American theater has produced,” noted Helen Hayes.

==Legacy==
Perry helped found, and was chairwoman and secretary of, the American Theatre Wing (ATW), which operated the Stage Door Canteens during World War II, providing entertainment to servicemen in several American cities. After her death, her friends and colleagues took action to memorialize her contribution to the high standards of American theatre. Brock Pemberton suggested that the ATW create a series of awards to be given in her honor. Since 1947, the Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Broadway Theatre have been given annually for distinguished achievement in theatre, and are one of the theatre world&#x27;s most coveted honors. They are universally known by their nickname, the Tony Awards. Fellow ATW co-founder and Perry&#x27;s close friend Louise Heims Beck was responsible for overseeing the organization of the 1st Tony Awards.

In 2011 Perry was featured as an historical figure when The Neo-Futurists devised a show about the longest-running failure in Broadway history, J. Frank Davis&#x27; &quot;The Ladder&quot;. The Neo-Futurist show was called &quot;Chalk &amp; Saltwater: The Ladder Project&quot;. &quot;Chalk &amp; Saltwater&quot; explored the individuals involved in the failed show this included Edgar B. Davis, the play&#x27;s backer and &quot;angel&quot;, Brock and Murdock Pemberton, and J. Frank Davis and their lives before and after &quot;The Ladder&quot;″s 789-performance run. Perry was a member of the original cast of &quot;The Ladder&quot;, but left the production prior to its close. 

Perry was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2004.

== Personal life ==
Perry had three daughters.

== Death ==
Perry was a devout Christian Scientist. Despite signs of heart disease, she refused to see a doctor. The day after her 58th birthday, on June 28, 1946, she died of a heart attack. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

<text>Isadora (also known as The Loves of Isadora) is a 1968 biographical drama film directed by Karel Reisz from a screenplay written by Melvyn Bragg, Margaret Drabble, and Clive Exton adapted from the books &quot;My Life&quot; by Isadora Duncan and &quot;Isadora, an Intimate Portrait&quot; by Sewell Stokes. The film follows the life of American pioneering modern contemporary dance artist and choreographer Isadora Duncan, who performed to great acclaim throughout the US and Europe during the 19th century. A co-production between the United Kingdom and France, it stars Vanessa Redgrave as Duncan and also features James Fox, Jason Robards, and John Fraser in supporting roles.

&quot;Isadora&quot; was in the main competition at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival where Redgrave won the Best Actress Prize. The film&#x27;s initial limited theatrical release on 18 December 1968 by Universal Pictures in Los Angeles was for the Academy Award qualification. Its general release in Spring 1969 received generally positive reviews with major acclaim for Redgrave&#x27;s performance. However the film underperformed at the box office grossing mere $1.25 million on a $1.7 million budget. For her performance, Redgrave won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, and received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

== Plot ==
In 1927, Isadora Duncan has become a legend as the innovator of modern dance, a temperamental bohemian, and an outspoken advocate of free love. Now past 40, she lives in poverty in a small hotel on the French Riviera with her companion Mary Estelle Dempsey/Mary Desti (named only as Mary in the film) and her secretary Roger, to whom she is dictating her memoirs. As a young girl in California, Isadora first demonstrates her disdain for accepted social standards by burning her parents&#x27; marriage certificate and pledging her dedication to the pursuit of art and beauty. In 1896, she performs under the name of Peppy Dora in a rowdy music hall in Chicago and publicly embarrasses the theatre manager into paying her $300 so that she can take her family to England. Modelling her free-form style of dance and costume after Greek classicism, she rapidly acquires international acclaim.

In Berlin, she meets her first love, Gordon Craig, a young stage designer who promises her that together they will create a new world of theatre. After bearing the already-married Craig a daughter, Isadora moves to Paris and meets Paris Singer, a millionaire who lavishes gifts upon her and later buys her an enormous estate for her to open a School for Life, where only beauty and simplicity are taught.

Following the birth of a son, Isadora returns to England with Singer but becomes bored with her quiet life and enters into an affair with her pianist, Armand. A short time later, both of her children are drowned when their chauffeur-driven car plunges off a bridge into the Seine. Broken by the tragedy, Isadora leaves Singer and wanders about Europe until in 1921 she receives an offer to open a dancing school in the Soviet Union.

Unaffected by the country&#x27;s poverty, she develops a strong rapport with the peasantry and has a passionate affair with Sergei Essenin, a volatile poet whom she marries so that he can obtain a visa to accompany her to the United States. Essenin&#x27;s outrageous behaviour turns a press conference into a shambles, however, and US anti-Bolshevist sentiment turns to open hostility when Isadora bares her breasts during a dance recital in Boston. Following the disintegration of her marriage, she returns to Nice to write her memoirs. Impulsively selling her possessions to open a new school in Paris, Isadora goes to a local café to celebrate and spots Bugatti, a handsome Italian whom she has been admiring for several days. She goes for a drive with him in his sports car, and as they roar along a road by the sea, Isadora&#x27;s long chiffon scarf catches in the spokes of a wheel and strangles her.

== Cast ==
== Releases ==
The original 177-minute version premiered at Loew&#x27;s Hollywood in Los Angeles on 18 December 1968. While praising Redgrave&#x27;s performance, critics took issue with the film&#x27;s length and pacing and 20 minutes were soon cut. Despite the reduced running time, the film still performed disappointingly and the film closed at Loew&#x27;s Hollywood on 6 February 1969.

The 140-minute cut opened in Europe in spring 1969, while the 131-minute Northern American version, retitled &quot;The Loves of Isadora&quot;, premiered in April of that year.

NBC-TV broadcast a partially restored version of the original cut on 30 June – 1 July 1972, running 168 minutes. It was repeated in April 1973, then made available for syndication.

Reisz&#x27; director&#x27;s cut debuted on California cable station Z Channel in 1986, then was released on VHS in July 1988 by MCA Home Video.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an aggregate score of 80% based on 8 positive and 2 negative critic reviews.

== Soundtrack ==
Kapp Records issued a soundtrack stereo LP, &quot;The Loves of Isadora&quot;, in October 1969 (catalogue number KRS-5511). It includes Jarre&#x27;s theme music, Anthony Bowles&#x27; incidental music, orchestral music by Bach, Beethoven, Bizet, Borodin and Tchaikovsky used on the soundtrack, and the song &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by Jarre. The cover of the North American pressings of the soundtrack feature a photo of Redgrave by Victor Skrebneski, taken during the production of the movie &quot;Camelot&quot;.

<text>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is a novel by Muriel Spark, the best known of her works. It was first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine and was published as a book by Macmillan in 1961. The character of Miss Jean Brodie brought Spark international fame and brought her into the first rank of contemporary Scottish literature. In 2005, the novel was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to present. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; No. 76 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Plot summary==
In 1930s Edinburgh, six 10-year-old girls, Sandy, Rose, Mary, Jenny, Monica, and Eunice, are assigned Miss Jean Brodie, who describes herself as being &quot;in [her] prime,&quot; as their teacher. Miss Brodie, determined that they shall receive an education in the original sense of the Latin verb &quot;educere&quot;, &quot;to lead out&quot;, gives her students lessons about her personal love life and travels, promoting art history, classical studies, and fascism. Under her mentorship, these six girls whom Brodie singles out as the elite group among her students—known as the &quot;Brodie set&quot;—begin to stand out from the rest of the school. However, in one of the novel&#x27;s typical flash-forwards we learn that one of them later will betray Brodie, ruining her teaching career, but that she never will learn which one.

In the Junior School, they meet the singing teacher, the short Mr. Gordon Lowther, and the art master, the handsome, one-armed war veteran Mr. Teddy Lloyd, a married Catholic with six children. These two teachers form a love triangle with Miss Brodie, each loving her, but she loves only Mr. Lloyd. However, Miss Brodie never overtly acts on her love for Mr. Lloyd except once to exchange a kiss with him, witnessed by Monica. During a two-week absence from school, Miss Brodie embarks on an affair with Mr. Lowther on the grounds that a bachelor makes a more respectable paramour: She has renounced Mr. Lloyd as he is married. At one point during these two years in the Junior School, Jenny is &quot;accosted by a man joyfully exposing himself beside the Water of Leith.&quot; The police investigation of the exposure leads Sandy to imagine herself as part of a fictional police force seeking incriminating evidence in respect of Brodie and Mr. Lowther.

Once the girls are promoted to the Senior School (around age 12) but now dispersed, they hold on to their identity as the Brodie set. Miss Brodie keeps in touch with them after school hours by inviting them to her home as she did when they were her pupils. All the while, the headmistress Miss Mackay tries to break them up and compile information gleaned from them into sufficient cause for Brodie&#x27;s dismissal. Miss Mackay has more than once suggested to Miss Brodie that she should seek employment at a &#x27;progressive&#x27; school; Miss Brodie declines to move to what she describes as a &#x27;crank&#x27; school. When two other teachers at the school, the Kerr sisters, take part-time employment as Mr. Lowther&#x27;s housekeepers, Miss Brodie tries to take over their duties. She sets about fattening him with extravagant cooking. The girls, now aged 13, visit Miss Brodie in pairs at Mr. Lowther&#x27;s house, where Miss Brodie frequently asks about Mr. Lloyd in Mr. Lowther&#x27;s presence. At this point, Mr. Lloyd asks Rose and occasionally the other girls to pose for him as portrait subjects. Each face he paints ultimately resembles Miss Brodie, as her girls report to her in detail, and she is thrilled. One day when Sandy is visiting Mr. Lloyd, he kisses her.

Before the Brodie set turns 16, Miss Brodie tests her girls to discover which of them she can trust, ultimately settling on Sandy as her confidante. Miss Brodie is obsessed with the notion that Rose, as the most beautiful of the Brodie set, should have an affair with Mr. Lloyd in her place. She begins to neglect Mr. Lowther, who then marries Miss Lockhart, the science teacher. Another student, Joyce Emily, steps briefly into the picture, trying unsuccessfully to join the Brodie set. Miss Brodie takes her under her wing separately, encouraging her to run away to fight in the Spanish Civil War on the Nationalist side, which she does, only to be killed in an accident when the train she is travelling in is attacked.

The original Brodie set, now aged 17 and in their final year of school, begin to go their separate ways. Mary and Jenny leave before taking their exams, Mary to become a typist and Jenny to pursue a career in acting. Eunice becomes a nurse and Monica a scientist. Rose lands a handsome husband. Sandy, with a keen interest in psychology, is fascinated by Mr. Lloyd&#x27;s stubborn love, his painter&#x27;s mind, and his religion. Sandy and Rose model for Mr. Lloyd&#x27;s paintings, Sandy knowing that Miss Brodie expects Rose to become sexually involved with Lloyd. Rose, however, is oblivious to the plan crafted for her, and so it is Sandy, now 18 and alone with Mr. Lloyd in his house while his wife and children are on holiday, who has exactly such an affair with him for five weeks during the summer. Over time, Sandy&#x27;s interest in the man wanes while her interest in the mind that still loves Jean Brodie grows. In the end, Sandy leaves him, adopts his Catholic religion, and becomes a nun. Beforehand, however, she meets with Miss Mackay and blatantly confesses to wanting to bring a stop to Miss Brodie. She suggests that the headmistress could accuse Brodie of encouraging fascism, and this tactic succeeds. Not until her dying moment a year after the end of World War II is Miss Brodie able to imagine that it was Sandy who betrayed her. After her death, Sandy, now called Sister Helena of the Transfiguration and author of &quot;The Transfiguration of the Commonplace,&quot; maintains that &quot;it&#x27;s only possible to betray where loyalty is due.&quot; One day, an enquiring young man visits Sandy at the convent because of her strange book on psychology. He enquires about the main influences of her school years, asking her: &quot;Were they literary or political or personal? Was it Calvinism?&quot; Sandy answers him by saying: &quot;There was a Miss Jean Brodie in her prime.&quot;

==Characters==

===Main characters===

;Jean Brodie:
&quot;She thinks she is Providence, thought Sandy, she thinks she is the God of Calvin.&quot; In some ways she is: in her prime she draws her chosen few to herself, much as Calvinists understand God to draw the elect to their salvation. With regard to religion, Miss Brodie &quot;was not in any doubt, she let everyone know she was in no doubt, that God was on her side whatever her course, and so she experienced no difficulty or sense of hypocrisy in worship while at the same time she went to bed with the singing master.&quot; Feeling herself fated one way or another, Brodie acts as if she transcends morality.

;Sandy Stranger:
Of the set, &quot;Miss Brodie fixed on Sandy,&quot; taking her as her special confidante. She is characterised as having &quot;small, almost nonexistent, eyes&quot; and a peering gaze. Miss Brodie repeatedly reminds Sandy that she has insight but no instinct. Sandy rejects Calvinism, reacting against its rigid predestination in favour of Catholicism.

;Rose Stanley:
In contrast to Sandy, Rose is an attractive blonde with (according to Miss Brodie) instinct but no insight. Although somewhat undeservedly, Rose is &quot;famous for sex&quot;, and the art teacher Mr. Lloyd asks her to model for his paintings: It becomes clear that he has no sexual interest in her and uses her simply because she is a good model. In every painting, Rose has the likeness of Brodie, whom Mr. Lloyd stubbornly loves. Rose and Sandy are the two girls in whom Miss Brodie places the most hope of becoming the crème de la crème. Again unlike Sandy, Rose &quot;shook off Miss Brodie&#x27;s influence as a dog shakes pond-water from its coat.&quot;

;Mary Macgregor:
Dim-witted and slow, Mary is Brodie&#x27;s scapegoat. Mary meekly bears the blame for everything that goes wrong. At the age of 23, she dies in a hotel fire, killed running back and forth through the hotel, unable to escape. 

===Supporting characters===

*Monica Douglas – one of the set; famous for mathematics and her anger
*Jenny Gray – one of the set; famous for her beauty
*Eunice Gardiner – one of the set; famous for her gymnastics and glorious swimming
*Teddy Lloyd – the art master
*Gordon Lowther – the singing master
*Miss Mackay – the headmistress
*Miss Alison Kerr – the sewing mistress of Marcia Blaine with her sister Ellen
*Miss Ellen Kerr – Miss Alison&#x27;s elder sister
*Miss Gaunt – a school mistress and a sister to the minister of Cramond
*Miss Lockhart – a chemistry teacher, the nicest teacher in Marcia Blaine
*Joyce Emily Hammond – a girl who was sent to Marcia Blaine, who later dies in the Spanish Civil War

==Structure==

Spark creates deep characterisations that are realistic in their human imperfections. Hal Hager, in his commentary on the novel, writes of Sandy and Miss Brodie: &quot;The complexity of these two characters, especially Jean Brodie, mirrors the complexity of human life. Jean Brodie is genuinely intent on opening up her girls&#x27; lives, on heightening their awareness of themselves and their world, and on breaking free of restrictive, conventional ways of thinking, feeling, and being&quot;. Critic James Wood noted that by &quot;reducing Miss Brodie to no more than a collection of maxims, Spark forces us to become Brodie&#x27;s pupils. In the course of the novel we never leave the school to go home, alone, with Miss Brodie. We surmise that there is something unfulfilled and even desperate about her, but the novelist refuses us access to her interior. Brodie talks a great deal about her prime, but we don&#x27;t witness it, and the nasty suspicion falls that perhaps to talk so much about one&#x27;s prime is by definition no longer to be in it.&quot;

==Autobiographical basis of the story==
The character of Miss Jean Brodie was based in part on Christina Kay, a teacher of Spark&#x27;s for two years at James Gillespie&#x27;s School for Girls. Spark later wrote of her: &quot;What filled our minds with wonder and made Christina Kay so memorable was the personal drama and poetry within which everything in her classroom happened.&quot; Miss Kay was the basis for the good parts of Brodie&#x27;s character, but also some of the more bizarre; for example, Miss Kay did hang posters of Renaissance paintings on the wall, but also of Benito Mussolini and Italian fascists marching. Spark grew up in heavily Presbyterian Edinburgh, and Franco&#x27;s supporters were almost unanimously Catholic. Christina Kay looked after her widowed mother, not the music teacher who was in love with her. She encouraged the young Muriel Spark to become a writer. Spark, like Sandy, converted to Catholicism.

==Adaptations==

The novel has been adapted for stage, film and television.

The original 1966 London stage version starred Vanessa Redgrave and Olivia Hussey. Redgrave turned down the Broadway production in 1968, which starred Zoe Caldwell who later won the Tony Award. Redgrave also turned down the film role. In 1969, the film &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; was released. It starred Maggie Smith, and she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. In 1978, Scottish Television produced the seven part serial &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;. It starred Geraldine McEwan. The author preferred the latter&#x27;s performance.

Jay Presson Allen&#x27;s adaptation of the novel was staged at the Brunton Theatre, Musselburgh, under the direction of Charles Nowosielski, in October 1987, with Beth Robens in the title role.

==Critical reception==
On 5 November 2019, &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; appeared on the BBC News list of the 100 most influential novels.

<text>The Rosette Nebula (also known as Caldwell 49) is an H II region located near one end of a giant molecular cloud in the Monoceros region of the Milky Way Galaxy. The open cluster NGC 2244 (Caldwell 50) is closely associated with the nebulosity, the stars of the cluster having been formed from the nebula&#x27;s matter. 

The nebula has been noted to be having a shape reminiscent of a human skull, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Skull Nebula&quot;. It is not to be confused with NGC 246, which is also nicknamed the &quot;Skull Nebula&quot;. 

==Description==

The complex has the following New General Catalogue (NGC) designations:
*NGC 2237 – Part of the nebulous region (Also used to denote whole nebula)
*NGC 2238 – Part of the nebulous region
*NGC 2239 – Part of the nebulous region (Discovered by John Herschel)
*NGC 2244 – The open cluster within the nebula (Discovered by John Flamsteed in 1690)
*NGC 2246 – Part of the nebulous region

The cluster and nebula lie at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth and measure roughly 130 light years in diameter. The radiation from the young stars excites the atoms in the nebula, causing them to emit radiation themselves producing the emission nebula we see. The mass of the nebula is estimated to be around 10,000 solar masses.

A survey of the nebula with the Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed the presence of numerous new-born stars inside optical Rosette Nebula and studded within a dense molecular cloud. Altogether, approximately 2500 young stars lie in this star-forming complex, including the massive O-type stars HD 46223 and HD 46150, which are primarily responsible for blowing the ionized bubble.
Most of the ongoing star-formation activity is occurring in the dense molecular cloud to the south east of the bubble.

A diffuse X-ray glow is also seen between the stars in the bubble, which has been attributed to a super-hot plasma with temperatures ranging from 1 to 10 million K.
This is significantly hotter than the 10,000 K plasmas seen in HII regions, and is likely attributed to the shock-heated winds from the massive O-type stars.

On April 16, 2019, the Oklahoma Legislature passed HB1292 making the Rosette Nebula as the official state astronomical object. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed it into law April 22, 2019.

<doc id="217773" wikidata="Q386300" url="?curid=217773" title="Septic tank">
<text>A septic tank is an underground chamber made of concrete, fiberglass, or plastic through which domestic wastewater (sewage) flows for basic sewage treatment. Settling and anaerobic digestion processes reduce solids and organics, but the treatment efficiency is only moderate (referred to as &quot;primary treatment&quot;). Septic tank systems are a type of simple onsite sewage facility. They can be used in areas that are not connected to a sewerage system, such as rural areas. The treated liquid effluent is commonly disposed in a septic drain field, which provides further treatment. Nonetheless, groundwater pollution may occur and is a problem.

The term &quot;septic&quot; refers to the anaerobic bacterial environment that develops in the tank that decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other onsite wastewater treatment units such as biofilters or aerobic systems involving artificially forced aeration.

The rate of accumulation of sludge—also called septage or fecal sludge—is faster than the rate of decomposition. Therefore, the accumulated fecal sludge must be periodically removed, which is commonly done with a vacuum truck.
==Description==

A septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4,500 and 7,500 litres (1,000 and 2,000 gallons); one end is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe and the other to a septic drain field. Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today, the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers, each equipped with an access opening and cover, and separated by a dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.

Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested, reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber, where further settlement takes place. One option for the effluent is the draining into the septic drain field, also referred to as a leach field, drain field or seepage field, depending upon locality. A percolation test is required prior to installation to ensure the porosity of the soil is adequate to serve as a drain field.

Septic tank effluent can also be conveyed to a secondary treatment, typically constructed wetlands. Constructed wetlands benefit from the good performance of septic tanks at removing solids, which avoids them getting clogged quickly. 

Septic tank effluent can also be conveyed to a centralized treatment facility. 

The remaining impurities are trapped and eliminated in the soil, with the excess water eliminated through percolation into the soil, through evaporation, and by uptake through the root system of plants and eventual transpiration or entering groundwater or surface water. A piping network, often laid in a stone-filled trench (see weeping tile), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the drain field is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone or, where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift pump. 

Certain septic tank designs include siphons or other devices to increase the volume and velocity of outflow to the drainage field. These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the drainage field life by preventing premature clogging or bioclogging.

An Imhoff tank is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the effluent from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.

A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour-free. Besides periodic inspection and emptying, a septic tank should last for decades with minimal maintenance, with concrete, fibreglass, or plastic tanks lasting about 50 years.

==Emptying (desludging) ==
Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion must eventually be removed from the septic tank. Otherwise the septic tank fills up and wastewater containing undecomposed material discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this detrimental for the environment but, if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or decrease the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.

When a septic tank is emptied, the accumulated sludge (septage, also known as fecal sludge) is pumped out of the tank by a vacuum truck. How often the septic tank must be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids, and the ambient temperature (because anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures), as well as usage, system characteristics and the requirements of the relevant authority.

Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the decision of an inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10–20 years between pumpings. An older system with an undersize tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly restarted when the tank is refilled.

An empty tank may be damaged by hydrostatic pressure causing the tank to partially &quot;float&quot; out of the ground, especially in flood situations or very wet ground conditions.

Another option is &quot;scheduled desludging&quot; of septic tanks which has been initiated in several Asian countries including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. In this process, every property is covered along a defined route and the property occupiers are informed in advance about desludging that will take place.

==Maintenance==

The maintenance of a septic system is often the responsibility of the resident or property owner. Some forms of abuse or neglect include the following:

=== User&#x27;s actions ===
* Excessive disposal of cooking oils and grease can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.
* Flushing non-biodegradable waste items down the toilet such as cigarette butts, cotton buds/swabs or menstrual hygiene products and condoms can cause a septic tank to clog and fill rapidly, so these materials should not be disposed of in that manner. The same applies when the toilet is connected to a sewer rather than a septic tank. 
* Using the toilet for disposal of food waste can cause a rapid overload of the system with solids and contribute to failure.
* Certain chemicals may damage the components of a septic tank or kill the bacteria needed in the septic tank for the system to operate properly, such as pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye), or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.
* Using water softeners – the brine discharge from water softeners may harm the bacteria responsible for breaking down the wastewater. Usually, however, the brine is sufficiently diluted with other wastewater that it does not adversely affect the septic system.

=== Other factors ===
* Roots from trees and shrubbery protruding above the tank or drainfield may clog and/or rupture them. Trees that are directly within the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, and the trees themselves tend to expand extremely vigorously due to the ready supply of nutrients from the septic system.
* Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impermeable surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.
* Excessive water entering the system may overload it and cause it to fail.
* Very high rainfall, rapid snowmelt, and flooding from rivers or the sea can all prevent a drain field from operating, and can cause flow to back up, interfering with the normal operation of the tank. High winter water tables can also result in groundwater flowing back into the septic tank.
* Over time, biofilms develop on the pipes of the drainage field, which can lead to blockage. Such a failure can be referred to as &quot;biomat failure&quot;.

=== Septic tank additives ===

Septic tank additives have been promoted by some manufacturers with the aim to improve the effluent quality from septic tanks, reduce sludge build-up and to reduce odors. These additives—which are commonly based on &quot;effective microorganisms&quot;—are usually costly in the longer term and fail to live up to expectations. It has been estimated that in the U.S. more than 1,200 septic system additives were available on the market in 2011. Very little peer-reviewed and replicated field research exists regarding the efficacy of these biological septic tank additives.

==Environmental concerns==
While a properly maintained and located septic tank poses no higher amount of environmental problems than centralized municipal sewage treatment, certain problems could arise with a septic tank in an unsuitable location, and septic tank failures are typically more expensive to fix or replace than municipal sewer. Since septic systems require large drainfields, they are unsuitable for densely built areas.

=== Odor, gas emissions and carbon footprint ===
Some constituents of wastewater, especially sulfates, under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to hydrogen sulfide, a pungent and toxic gas. Nitrates and organic nitrogen compounds can be reduced to ammonia. Because of the anaerobic conditions, fermentation and methanogenesis processes take place, which may generate carbon dioxide and/or methane. Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases, with methane having a global warming potential about 25 times larger than carbon dioxide. This makes septic tanks potential greenhouse gas emitters. The same methane can be burnt to produce energy for local usage.

=== Nutrients in the effluent ===
Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing nitrogen compounds that have potential to cause algal blooms in waterways into which affected water from a septic system finds its way. This can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology, such as hybrid constructed wetlands, or by simply ensuring that the leach field is properly sited to prevent direct entry of effluent into bodies of water.

The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anaerobic with a low redox potential, which keeps phosphates in a soluble and, thus, mobilized form. Phosphates discharged from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms, which can also include blooms of potentially toxic cyanobacteria.

The soil&#x27;s capacity to retain phosphorus is usually large enough to handle the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when septic drain fields are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjacent to a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphates. Phosphates will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of eutrophication to surface waters.

=== Pathogens ===

Diseases extremely dangerous to human contact such as E. coli and other coliform bacteria are often reported following failures of septic tanks.

A properly functioning septic system, on the other hand, provides significant reduction of pathogens compared to direct discharge due to settling (in the tank) and soil absorption (in the drain field). Log reductions of 4–8 for coliform bacteria, 0–2 for viruses are achieved in the effluent. Parasitic worm eggs are also removed. Additional filters may be added to improve removal performance although they will need to be replaced periodically.

=== Groundwater pollution ===
In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution beyond acceptable limits may occur. Some small towns experience the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, due to the high cost of extended collection systems. To reduce residential development that might increase the demand to construct an expensive centralized sewerage system, building moratoriums and limitations on the subdivision of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.

=== Surface water pollution ===
In areas adjacent to water bodies with fish or shellfish intended for human consumption, improperly maintained and failing septic systems contribute to pollution levels that can force harvest restrictions and/or commercial or recreational harvest closures.

== Use ==

In the United States, the 2008 American Housing Survey indicated that about 20 percent of all households rely on septic tanks, and that the overwhelming majority of systems are located in rural (50%) and suburban (47%) areas. Indianapolis is one example of a large city where many of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods still rely on separate septic systems. In Europe, septic systems are generally limited to rural areas.

==Regulations==
=== European Union ===
In the European Union the EN 12566 standard provides the general requirements for packaged and site assembled treatment plants used for domestic wastewater treatment.

Part 1 (EN 12566-1) is for septic tanks that are prefabricated or factory manufactured and made of polyethylene, glass reinforced polyester, polypropylene, PVC-U, steel or concrete. Part 4 (EN 12566-4) regulates septic tanks that are assembled on site from prefabricated kits, generally of concrete construction. Certified septic tanks of both types must pass a standardized hydraulic test to assess their ability to retain suspended solids within the system. Additionally, their structural adequacy in relevant ground conditions is assessed in terms of water-tightness, treatment efficiency, and structural behaviour.

==== France ====

In France, about 4 million households (or 20% of the population) are using on-site wastewater disposal systems (&quot;l’assainissement non collectif&quot;), including septic tanks (&quot;fosse septique&quot;). The legal framework for regulating the construction and maintenance of septic systems was introduced in 1992 and updated in 2009 and 2012 with the intent to establish the technical requirements applicable to individual sewerage systems. Septic tanks in France are subject to inspection by SPANC (&quot;Service Public d’Assainissement Non Collectif&quot;), a professional body appointed by the respective local authorities to enforce wastewater collection laws, at least once in four years. Following the introduction of EN 12566, the discharge of effluent directly into ditches or watercourses is prohibited, unless the effluent meets prescribed standards.

==== Ireland ====

According to the Census of Ireland 2011, 27.5% of Irish households (i.e. about 440,000 households), with the majority in rural areas, use an individual septic tank.

Following a European Court of Justice judgment made against Ireland in 2009 that deemed the country non-compliant with the Waste Framework Directive in relation to domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside, the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 was passed in order to regulate wastewater discharges from domestic sources that are not connected to the public sewer network and to provide arrangements for registration and inspection of existing individual domestic wastewater treatment systems.

Additionally, a code of practice has been developed by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the planning and construction of new septic tanks, secondary treatment systems, septic drain fields and filter systems. Direct discharge of septic tank effluent into groundwater is prohibited in Ireland, while the indirect discharge via unsaturated subsoil into groundwater, e.g. by means of a septic drain field, or the direct discharge into surface water is permissible in accordance with a Water Pollution Act license. Registered septic tanks must be desludged by an authorized contractor at least once a year; the removed fecal sludge is disposed of, either to a managed municipal wastewater treatment facility or to agriculture provided that nutrient management regulations are met.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since 2015, only certain property owners in England and Wales with septic tanks or small packaged sewage treatment systems need to register their systems, and either apply for a permit or qualify for an exemption with the Environment Agency. Permits need to be granted to systems that discharge more than a certain volume of effluent in a given time or that discharge effluent directly into sensitive areas (e.g., some groundwater protection zones). In general, permits are not granted for new septic tanks that discharge directly into surface waters. A septic tank discharging into a watercourse must be replaced or upgraded by 1 January 2020 to a Sewage Treatment Plant (also called an Onsite sewage facility), or sooner if the property is sold before this date, or if the Environment Agency (EA) finds that it is causing pollution.

In Northern Ireland, the Department of the Environment must give permission for all wastewater discharges where it is proposed that the discharge will go to a waterway or soil infiltration system. The discharge consent will outline conditions relating to the quality and quantity of the discharge in order to ensure the receiving waterway or the underground aquifer can absorb the discharge.

The Water Environment Regulations 2011 regulate the registration of septic tank systems in Scotland. Proof of registration is required when new properties are being developed or existing properties change ownership.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, septic tank design and installation requirements are regulated by State Governments, through Departments of Health and Environmental Protection Agencies. Regulation may include Codes of Practice and Legislation. Regulatory requirements for the design and installation of septic tanks commonly references Australian Standards (1547 and 1546). Capacity requirements for septic tanks may be outlined within Codes of Practice, and can vary between states.

Mainly because of water leaching from the effluent drains of a lot of closely spaced septic systems, many council districts (e.g. Sunshine Coast, Queensland) have banned septic systems, and require them to be replaced with much more expensive small-scale sewage treatment systems that actively pump air into the tank, producing an aerobic environment. Septic systems have to be replaced as part of any new building applications, regardless of how well the old system performed.

=== United States ===
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, in the United States it is the home owners&#x27; responsibility to maintain their septic systems. Anyone who ignores this requirement will eventually experience costly repairs when solids escape the tank and clog the clarified liquid effluent disposal system.

In Washington, for example, a &quot;shellfish protection district&quot; or &quot;clean water district&quot; is a geographic service area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources. The district provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control non-point sources of pollution, such as septic system maintenance. The district also serves as an educational resource, calling attention to the pollution sources that threaten shellfish growing waters.

== Slang usage ==
The term &quot;septic tank&quot;, or more usually &quot;septic&quot;, is used in some parts of Britain as a slang term to refer to Americans, from Cockney rhyming slang septic tank equalling yank. This is sometimes further shortened to &quot;seppo&quot; by Australians .

<text>They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They? is a 1969 American psychological drama film directed by Sydney Pollack, from a screenplay written by Robert E. Thompson and James Poe, based on Horace McCoy&#x27;s 1935 novel. It stars Jane Fonda, Michael Sarrazin, Susannah York, Gig Young, Bonnie Bedelia, and Red Buttons. It focuses on a disparate group of individuals desperate to win a Depression-era dance marathon and an opportunistic emcee who urges them on.

The film was released theatrically in the United States on December 10, 1969, and also premiered at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival. Reviewers praised its direction, screenplay, depiction of the Depression era, and performances (especially of Fonda, York, and Young). It received nine nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards including: Best Director, Best Actress (for Fonda), Best Supporting Actress (for York), Best Adapted Screenplay, with Young winning for Best Supporting Actor. , it holds the record for obtaining the most Oscar nominations without receiving one for Best Picture.

==Plot==
Robert Syverton, a homeless man, recalls the events leading to an unstated crime. As a boy, he witnessed a horse who had broken its leg shot and put out of its misery. Years later, during the Great Depression, he wanders into a dance marathon that is about to begin in a shabby ballroom on the Santa Monica Pier. Couples are competing for a $1,500 cash prize and hoping to be spotted by Hollywood celebrities and talent scouts in the audience. Robert is recruited by Rocky, the contest&#x27;s promoter and emcee, to be the partner of a world-weary, bitter young woman named Gloria Beatty after her previous partner is disqualified for bronchitis. Other contestants include retired sailor Harry Kline, emotionally fragile aspiring London actress Alice, her partner and aspiring actor Joel, impoverished farmer James, and James&#x27; pregnant wife Ruby.

Early in the marathon, the weaker pairs are eliminated quickly. Rocky observes the vulnerabilities of stronger contestants and exploits them for the audience&#x27;s amusement. The arena uses quack doctors to cover up the extreme physical and mental damage to participants. Frayed nerves are exacerbated by the theft of one of Alice&#x27;s dresses, which Rocky uses to create artificial drama and entertain the audience, and Gloria&#x27;s displeasure at the attention Alice receives from Robert. Robert ends up pairing off with Alice, and Gloria takes Joel as her partner, switching to Harry after Joel leaves for a job.

Weeks into the marathon, to spark the spectators&#x27; enthusiasm, Rocky stages a series of derbies in which the couples race in tandem around the dance floor, with the last three pairs eliminated. Harry dies of a heart attack mid-lap, and Gloria avoids elimination by dragging him across the finish line. Rocky &quot;disqualifies&quot; Harry, concealing his death from the audience, and the medics remove his body from the dance floor. When Alice suffers a nervous breakdown, a sympathetic Rocky comforts her and removes her from the competition to receive genuine medical care. Lacking partners, Gloria and Robert team up once again.

Rocky suggests Gloria and Robert get married during the marathon, a publicity stunt guaranteed to earn them cash and gifts from supporters such as Mrs. Laydon, a wealthy woman who sponsors them throughout the contest. When Gloria refuses, Rocky reveals the invoice sheet: expenses will be deducted from the prize money, meaning even if the pair manage to win, they will leave with nothing. Dejected, Gloria and Robert withdraw from the competition and leave the dance hall.

As the two walk out onto the pier, a despondent Gloria confesses to Robert how empty she feels and that she is tired of life. She takes a gun from her purse and points it at her head but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. Desperate, she begs Robert to shoot her, which he does. Police officers arrive to arrest Robert and remove Gloria&#x27;s body. Asked why he did it, Robert tells the police that she asked him to, adding, &quot;They shoot horses, don&#x27;t they?&quot;

The marathon continues with the few remaining couples, having already reached 1,491 hours.

==Production==

===Development===
In the early 1950s, Norman Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin were looking for a project on which to collaborate, with Lloyd as director and Chaplin as producer. Lloyd purchased the rights to Horace McCoy&#x27;s novel for $3,000 and planned to cast Chaplin&#x27;s son, Sydney, and newcomer Marilyn Monroe in the lead roles. Once arrangements were completed, in 1952 Chaplin took his family on what was intended to be a brief trip to the United Kingdom for the London premiere of &quot;Limelight&quot;. During this trip, in part because Chaplin was accused of being a Communist supporter during the McCarthy era, FBI head J. Edgar Hoover negotiated with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to revoke his re-entry permit and the film project was cancelled. When the rights to the book reverted to McCoy&#x27;s heirs sixteen years later (he had died in 1955), they refused to renew the deal with Lloyd, since nothing had come of his original plans.

A script was written by James Poe, who wanted to direct. The rights were bought by Palomar Pictures, whose president was then Edgar Scherick. Scherick offered the project to the producing team of Bob Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were enthusiastic, but felt the script needed a rewrite and that they would struggle to make the film for Scherick&#x27;s desired budget of $900,000. They also had concerns about Poe&#x27;s ability as a director and worried that he was too arrogant.

Mia Farrow was interested in starring, but Scherick felt her fee of $500,000 was too high. Eventually it was agreed to show the script to Jane Fonda, who was interested. Michael Sarrazin was borrowed from Universal to play the male lead. Scherick eventually agreed to raise the budget to $4 million. Martin Baum became head of ABC Pictures, and Winkler says Baum arranged for Scherick to be fired. Baum wanted the second female lead to be played by Susannah York, though Poe had promised the role to his then-girlfriend. Winkler says it was Baum who suggested Red Buttons and Gig Young, and pushed for Poe to be fired. The producers were reluctant especially as Jane Fonda liked Poe and had director approval. Winkler arranged for Poe to direct a screen test for Bonnie Bedelia with Fonda; the test did not go well and Fonda became less enthusiastic about Poe&#x27;s capabilities as a director. Poe was fired from the project.

The main candidates to replace Poe were William Friedkin, Sydney Pollack, and Jack Smight. According to Winkler, Smight wanted $250,000, Friedkin wanted $200,000, and Pollack was willing to do it for $150,000; thus, Pollack got the job.

Fonda said she was originally unimpressed by the script, but her husband Roger Vadim, who saw similarities between the book and works of the French existentialists, urged her to reconsider.

Meeting with Pollack to discuss the script, she was surprised when he asked for her opinion. She later said, &quot;It was the first time a director asked me for input on how I saw the character and the story.&quot; She read the script with a critical eye, made notes on the character, and later observed in her autobiography, &quot;It was a germinal moment [for me] ... This was the first time in my life as an actor that I was working on a film about larger societal issues, and instead of my professional work feeling peripheral to life, it felt relevant.&quot; Troubled about problems in her marriage at the time, she drew on her personal anguish to help her with her characterization.

Pollack had the script rewritten by Robert E. Thompson. Warren Beatty originally was considered for the role of Robert Syverton and Pollack&#x27;s first choice for Rocky was character actor Lionel Stander.

===Filming===
During filming, there was an issue with York, who wanted a guarantee she would be able to make &quot;Country Dance&quot;. When this was not forthcoming, it seemed she would have to be replaced and Pollack suggested Sally Kellerman. However, York relented and agreed to make the film.

The film uses the unusual technique of flashforward (glimpses of the future). It occurs throughout the film, as passages appear foreshadowing the fate of Robert, just before the tragic ending. Costar Young was noted for his deep characterization of Rocky: he patterned his character after the bandleader and radio personality Ben Bernie, and used Bernie&#x27;s famous catchphrase, &quot;Yowzah! Yowzah! Yowzah!&quot;, for the character in the film.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Fine Arts Theatre on December 10, 1969.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was a box office success, grossing $12.6 million in the United States and Canada on a $4.86 million budget, generating theatrical rentals of $5.98 million making it the 16th highest-grossing film of 1969. It grossed $28,000 in its opening week.

===Critical response===
The film was screened at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. In the United States, the film was applauded for portraying the Depression era.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and named it as one of the best American movies of the 1970s:
&quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; is a masterful re-creation of the [dance] marathon era for audiences that are mostly unfamiliar with it. In addition to everything else it does, &quot;Horses&quot; holds our attention because it tells us something we didn&#x27;t know about human nature and American society. It tells us a lot more than that, of course, but because it works on this fundamental level as well.

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby said,
The movie is far from being perfect, but it is so disturbing in such important ways that I won&#x27;t forget it very easily, which is more than can be said of much better, more consistent films ... The movie is by far the best thing that Pollack has ever directed (with the possible exception of &quot;The Scalphunters&quot;). While the cameras remain, as if they had been sentenced, within the ballroom, picking up the details of the increasing despair of the dancers, the movie becomes an epic of exhaustion and futility.

&quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;Puffy-eyed, unshaven, reeking of stale liquor, sweat and cigarettes, Young has never looked older or acted better. Fonda ... gives a dramatic performance that gives the film a personal focus and an emotionally gripping power.&quot;

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described the film as &quot;quite hollow&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; rated the film four out of a possible four stars and said,
Although it is at times heavy-handed, &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; is a tour de force of acting. Fonda here got her first chance to prove herself as a serious, dramatic actress ... Young is superb in his role, a sharp switch from his usual bon vivant parts ... Pollack does one of his best jobs of directing, even if his primary strength lies in his rapport with actors. The look of the film is just right and Pollack skillfully evokes the ratty atmosphere amid which explosive emotions come to a boil ... [It] remains a suitably glum yet cathartic film experience.

In 1996, Steve Simels of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; observed, &quot;Sydney Pollack&#x27;s dance-marathon movie has probably aged better than any American film of its time.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1999. It was later reissued on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on October 19, 2004. Kino Lorber released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on September 5, 2017.

==Legacy==
Turner Classic Movies observed, &quot;By popularizing the title of McCoy&#x27;s novel, [the film] gave American argot a catch-phrase that&#x27;s as recognizable today as when the movie first caught on.&quot; The 1977 Chic song &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)&quot; was inspired by the film.

<text>Educational entertainment, also referred to by the portmanteau edutainment, is media designed to educate through entertainment. The term was used as early as 1954 by Walt Disney. Most often it includes content intended to teach but has incidental entertainment value. It has been used by academia, corporations, governments, and other entities in various countries to disseminate information in classrooms and/or via television, radio, and other media to influence viewers&#x27; opinions and behaviors.

== History ==

=== Concept ===
Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the Renaissance and Enlightenment being movements in which this combination was presented to students. Komenský in particular is affiliated with the &quot;school as play&quot; concept, which proposes pedagogy with dramatic or delightful elements.

&quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with Benjamin Franklin combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to Walt Disney, with his first educational short film, &quot;Tommy Tucker&#x27;s Tooth&quot;, being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute. The entry of the U.S. into World War II also had a major impact on the popularity of educational entertainment, as a relationship between Disney and the U.S. government formed; Disney was able to experiment with educational and nonfiction films in a way that continued even after the war, with series such as &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; and &quot;Disneyland&quot;. In the transcript of an interview with Alexander P. de Seversky from The Walt Disney Archives, of which its date and interviewer is unknown, the following quotation is found:Since the 1970s, various groups in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Latin America have used edutainment to address health and social issues such as substance abuse, immunization, teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and cancer. Initiatives in major universities, such as Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, NGOs such as PCI-Media Impact, and government agencies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have produced edutainment content.

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by Walt Disney to describe the &quot;True Life Adventures&quot; series. The noun &quot;edutainment&quot; is a neologistic portmanteau used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the National Geographic Society. It was used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project. The terms &quot;edutainment&quot; (and &quot;busitainment&quot;) were used in 2001 to explain how the CRUMPET project, on context-aware and personalised Tourism, refers to people travelling for adventure yet who also travel for education and business and who do not perceive themselves as classical &quot;tourists&quot;. The offshoot word &quot;Edutainer&quot; has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
&quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;Wishbone&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; are examples of shows that use music and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as YouTube, with such channels as &quot;Vsauce&quot;, &quot;CGP Grey&quot;, &quot;MinutePhysics&quot;, &quot;Meet Arnold, Veritasium, &quot;and &quot;Crash Course&quot;&quot;.

Public Service Broadcasting is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the British Film Institute into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album &quot;Inform-Educate-Entertain&quot;, which covers topics such as the climbing of Mount Everest and highway safety, demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.

=== Film and television ===
Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as &quot;Private Snafu&quot;, and can still be seen in films such as &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;. After World War II, educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via telenovelas, &quot;soap operas for social change&quot;. The &quot;Sabido method&quot; has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China. In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country&#x27;s high birth rate.

The third season of the television show &quot;MTV Shuga&quot; was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about sexual health and HIV, and secondarily, gender-based violence. In the randomized control trials, those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were &quot;almost twice as likely&quot; to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show&#x27;s effects on gender-based violence.

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia, Millefeuille about psoriasis and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK&#x27;s National Health Service.

=== Games ===
Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including board, card, quizzes, and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants &quot;multiple streams of information&quot; (p. 1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of &quot;fun&quot;. This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with meta-cognitive strategies to provide an increase in students&#x27; cognitive performance.

=== Radio and podcasts ===

Radio can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the Tanzanian radio soap opera &quot;Twende na Wakati&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Go With the Times&quot;) was written primarily to promote family planning.

Likewise, podcasts have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also podcasts used as an educational tool. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with &quot;TeachersPayTeachers&quot; finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of &quot;Serial&quot;.

Other successful radio programs and/or podcasts that have fused entertainment and education include:
*DJ Nihal&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 radio show which centered around &#x27;edutainment&#x27;. He mentions this term each time the show is broadcast.
*&quot;The Lawsons/Blue Hills&quot; – a radio program that was designed to help Australian farmers adjust to new farming methods.
*&quot;Tinka Tinka Sukh&quot; – a Hindi-language radio program that results in environmental and health improvements in India.

=== Toys ===
Toys are perhaps the earliest &quot;edutainment&quot; objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their aesthetic appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature piano) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy&#x27;s proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of mimicry and roleplay to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to simulation in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an instinct or a character trait in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to &quot;express&quot; those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express motherhood as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don&#x27;t possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static figurine, for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a Native American may be a starting point for exploring American history; a Santa Claus may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy astronaut to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly &quot;edutaining&quot; object, such as a picture book. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even &quot;grown-ups&quot; can learn through toys about children: what are their talents or interests; if they are more extrovert or introvert; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children&#x27;s abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as Lego or Rubik&#x27;s Cube, as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term &quot;edutainment&quot; was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by KRS-One (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his Boogie Down Productions album by the same name.

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture&#x27;s innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see Paulo Freire&#x27;s use of praxis in &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;) and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing. Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through &quot;building&quot; or &quot;building sessions.&quot;

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational. As an example, PowerPoint presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, &quot;The Onion&quot;, poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects. A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying &quot;When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something.&quot;

=== Theme parks ===
Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. Epcot at Walt Disney World, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company, is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park&#x27;s dedication plaque, written by Marty Sklar and Erwin Okun, states the following: &quot;May EPCOT Center entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man&#x27;s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere.&quot;

The offerings and promotions at SeaWorld associated with the educational topics of marine biology, conservation, and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming Abu Dhabi theme park, which is likely due to activism for animal rights.

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, Holy Land Experience, Dinosaur World, Busch Gardens, and Puy du Fou.

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing paradigm within the science center and children&#x27;s museum community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the zoo or a botanical garden. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, field trip visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and mobile apps, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing. Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted. Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.
== Effects in the classroom ==

Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of flipped classrooms, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned video lessons and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of preservice mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote critical thinking, increased engagement, and growth mindsets.

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy preceptors; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with disabled students by Amal Dandashi, &quot;et al.&quot; (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other &quot;reading encounters.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades. The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which &quot;The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background&quot; was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of &quot;White Wilderness&quot; prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in May 1971, John Holt criticizes the promotion of &quot;Right Answers&quot; in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; by theorist Neil Postman demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been &quot;transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.&quot; Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on &quot;the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment.&quot;

<doc id="217778" wikidata="Q659587" url="?curid=217778" title="House of Representatives (Japan)">
<text>The is the lower house of the National Diet of Japan. The House of Councillors is the upper house.
The composition of the House is established by and of the Constitution of Japan. The House of Representatives has 465 members, elected for a four-year term. Of these, 176 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 289 are elected from single-member constituencies.

The overall voting system used to elect the House of Representatives is a parallel system, a form of semi-proportional representation. Under a parallel system, the allocation of list seats does not take into account the outcome in the single seat constituencies. Therefore, the overall allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is not proportional, to the advantage of larger parties. In contrast, in bodies such as the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; or the New Zealand Parliament the election of single-seat members and party list members is linked, so that the overall result respects proportional representation fully or to some degree.

The House of Representatives is the more powerful of the two houses, able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority.

The last election for the House of Representatives was held on October 27, 2024, in which the Liberal Democratic Party and their coalition partner Komeito failed to reach a majority of 233 seats, instead winning 215, 18 short of a majority.

== Right to vote and candidature ==
* Japanese nationals aged 18 years and older may vote (prior to 2016, the voting age was 20).
* Japanese nationals aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.

== Differences between the Upper and Lower Houses ==
The House of Representatives has several powers not given to the House of Councillors. If a bill is passed by the lower house (the House of Representatives) but is voted down by the upper house (the House of Councillors) the House of Representatives can override the decision of the House of Councillors by a two-thirds vote in the affirmative. However, in the case of treaties, the budget, and the selection of the prime minister, the House of Councillors can only delay passage, but not block the legislation. As a result, the House of Representatives is considered the more powerful house.

Members of the House of Representatives, who are elected to a maximum of four years, sit for a shorter term than members of the House of Councillors, who are elected to full six-year terms. The lower house can also be dissolved by the Prime Minister or the passage of a nonconfidence motion, while the House of Councillors cannot be dissolved. Thus the House of Representatives is considered to be more sensitive to public opinion, and is termed the &quot;lower house&quot;.

While the legislative term is nominally 4 years, early elections for the lower house are very common, and the median lifespan of postwar legislatures has in practice been around 3 years.

== Current composition ==
For a list of majoritarian members and proportional members from Hokkaidō, see the List of members of the Diet of Japan.

== Latest election result ==

== Historical composition ==
=== Before World War II (1890–1942) ===
=== After World War II (since 1946) ===


== Election results for major parties since 1958 ==
Shaded
* green: Ruling party/coalition before and after the lower house election
* red: Ruling party/coalition &quot;until&quot; the election = Change of government as a result of the lower house election
* blue: Ruling party/coalition &quot;after&quot; the election = Change of government as a result of the lower house election
* none: Opposition before and after the election
&quot;Note that the composition of the ruling coalition may change between lower house elections, e.g. after upper house elections. Parties who vote with the government in the Diet, but are not part of the cabinet (e.g. SDP &amp; NPH after the 1996 election) are not shaded.&quot;

== History ==
===Meiji period (1890–1912)===


The Japanese parliament, then known as the Imperial Diet, was established in 1890 as a result of the 1889 Meiji Constitution. It was modeled on the parliaments of several Western countries, particularly the German Empire and the United Kingdom, because of the Emperor Meiji&#x27;s westernizing reforms. The Imperial Diet consisted of two chambers, the elected House of Representatives which was the lower house, and the House of Peers which was the upper house. This format was similar to the House of Lords in the Westminster system, or the Herrenhaus in Prussia, where the upper house represented the aristocracy.

Both houses, and also the Emperor, had to agree on legislation, and even at the height of party-based constitutional government, the House of Peers could simply vote down bills deemed too liberal by the Meiji oligarchy, such as the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage, increases in local autonomy, or trade union rights. The prime minister and his government served at the Emperor&#x27;s pleasure, and could not be removed by the Imperial Diet. However, the right to vote on, and if necessary to block, legislation including the budget, gave the House of Representatives leverage to force the government into negotiations. After an early period of frequent confrontation and temporary alliances between the cabinet and political parties in the lower house, parts of the Meiji oligarchy more sympathetic to political parties around Itō Hirobumi and parts of the liberal parties eventually formed a more permanent alliance, in the form of the Rikken Seiyūkai in 1900. The confidence of the House of Representatives was never a formal requirement to govern, but between 1905 and 1918, only one cabinet took office that did not enjoy majority support in the House of Representatives.

=== Taisho and early Showa periods (1912–1937) ===
During the Taishō political crisis in 1913, a no-confidence vote against the third Katsura government, accompanied by major demonstrations outside the Diet, was followed shortly by resignation. Subsequently, in the period often referred to as Taishō democracy, it became increasingly customary to appoint many ministers, including several prime ministers, from the House of Representatives – Hara Takashi was the first commoner to become prime minister in 1918.

In the same year, the Rice Riots had confronted the government with an unprecedented scale of domestic unrest, and a German Revolution brought the Prusso-German monarchy to an end, the very system Meiji oligarchs had used as the main model for the Meiji constitution to consolidate and preserve Imperial power. Even Yamagata Aritomo and other oligarchs that had been fundamentally opposed to political parties, became more inclined to cooperate with the still mainly bourgeoisie parties, to prevent a rise of socialism or other movements that might threaten Imperial rule. Socialist parties would not be represented in significant numbers in the lower house until the 1930s.

The initially very high census suffrage requirement was reduced several times, until the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1925. The electoral system to the House of Representatives was also fundamentally changed several times: between systems of &quot;small&quot; mostly single- and few multi-member electoral districts (1890s, 1920, 1924), &quot;medium&quot; mostly multi-member districts (1928–1942) and &quot;large&quot; electoral districts (usually only one, rarely two city and one counties district per prefecture; 1900s and 1910s), using first-past-the-post in single-member districts, plurality-at-large voting (1890s) or single non-transferable vote in the multi-member districts.

Influence of the House of Representatives on the government increased, and the party cabinets of the 1920s brought Japan apparently closer to a parliamentary system of government, and there were several reforms to the upper house in 1925. However, the balance of powers between the two houses and the influential role of extra-constitutional actors such as the Genrō (who still selected the prime minister) or the military (that had brought down several cabinets) remained in essence untouched. Within a year of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in September 1931, a series of assassinations and coup attempts followed. Party governments were replaced by governments of &quot;national unity&quot; (&quot;kyokoku itchi&quot;) which were dominated by nobles, bureaucrats and increasingly the military.

=== World War II and aftermath (1937–1947) ===
After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the start of war in 1937, the influence of the Imperial Diet was further diminished, though never eliminated, by special laws such as the National Mobilization Law and expanded powers for cabinet agencies such as the Planning Board. The House of Representatives in the Empire had a four-year term and could be dissolved by the Emperor. In contrast, members of the House of Peers had either life tenure (subject to revocation by the Emperor) or a seven-year term in the case of members elected in mutual peerage elections among the three lower peerage ranks, top taxpayer and academic peerage elections. During the war, the term of the members of the House of Representatives elected in the last pre-war election of 1937 was extended by one year.

In the 1946 election to the House of Representatives, held under the U.S.-led Allied occupation of Japan, women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced, and a system of &quot;large&quot; electoral districts (one or two per prefecture) with limited voting was used. A change in the electoral law in April 1945 had for the first time allocated 30 seats to the established colonies of the Empire: Karafuto (Sakhalin), Taiwan, and Chōsen (Korea); but this change was never implemented. Similarly, Korea and Taiwan were granted several appointed members of the House of Peers in 1945.

In 1946, both houses of the Imperial Diet (together with the Emperor) passed the postwar constitutional amendment which took effect in 1947. The Imperial Diet was renamed the National Diet, the House of Peers was replaced by an elected upper house called the House of Councillors, and the House of Representatives would now be able to override the upper house in important matters. The constitution also gave the Diet exclusive legislative authority, without involvement of the Emperor, and explicitly made the cabinet responsible to the Diet and requires that the prime minister has the support of a majority in the House of Representatives.

=== Late Showa period (1947–1989) ===


The Diet first met under the new constitution on May 20, 1947. Four days later, Tetsu Katayama of the Democratic Socialist Party became Japan&#x27;s first socialist prime minister and the first since the introduction of parliamentarianism.

Since the end of US rule in 1952, it has been the norm that the prime minister dissolves the House of Representatives before its 4-year term expires. Only once, in 1976, did the House last a full 4 years. It has become tradition to give nicknames to each dissolution, usually referencing a major political issue or controversy. One infamous example was on March 14, 1953, when Shigeru Yoshida dissolved the House and called for new election, after he name called people during a meeting of the budget committee. This came to be known as the &quot;&quot;you idiot&quot; dissolution&quot;.

In 1955, prime minister Ichirō Hatoyama oversaw the creation of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which since his third government has dominated Japanese politics under the 1955 System. The LDP would govern without interruption for nearly 40 years until the 1993 election, alone save for a three-year coalition government with the New Liberal Club after the 1983 election.

Hatoyama planned to change the electoral system to first past the post, introducing a bill to that effect in March 1956. This was met with opposition from the Socialist Party, who criticized Hatoyama&#x27;s plan as a &quot;Hatomander&quot;. The bill passed the House of Representatives in May 1956, but was never voted on by the House of Councillors. Electoral reform came into vogue again in the 1970s, but Kakuei Tanaka&#x27;s plan met opposition internally in the LDP and never came to a vote in either chamber of the Diet.

===Heisei and Reiwa periods (since 1989)===
Japan entered a lengthy recession in the 1990s (see Lost Decades), which many people blamed on the LDP. In the 1993 election, the party lost power for the first time under the 1955 System, when an eight-party coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa of the Japan New Party were able to form a government. This government fell apart after nine months, and was succeeded by the Hata Cabinet, another short-lived non-LDP government. The LDP returned to power in 1994 with the Murayama Cabinet, this time in a coalition with their old rivals the Socialists, whose leader Tomiichi Murayama became prime minister.

As with party colleagues Ichirō Hatoyama and Kakuei Tanaka before him, prime minister Toshiki Kaifu of the LDP unsuccessfully tried to reform the electoral system in 1991. However, the Morihiro Hosokawa government got the 1994 Japanese electoral reform through the Diet, introducing a parallel voting system which went into effect at the next election in 1996. Under this system, which remains in effect as of 2022, 300 (since reduced to 289) members of the House of Representatives are elected using first past the post in single-member constituencies, while 200 (since reduced to 176) members are elected in regional blocs using party-list proportional representation.

Prime minister Junichiro Koizumi introduced a bill to the House of Representatives in 2006 on changing the Imperial Household Law to allow a woman to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne (see Japanese imperial succession debate), but he withdrew the bill after the birth of Prince Hisahito of Akishino the same year. The LDP once again lost power at the 2009 election, when the Democratic Party-led Hatoyama Cabinet took over, followed in rapid succession by the Kan Cabinet and Noda Cabinet. The LDP and Komeito, who had formed a two-party government between 2003 and 2009, came to power again after the 2012 election. Shinzo Abe, who had previously led the First Abe Cabinet, was prime minister for another stint lasting eight years, stepping down for health reasons in 2020.

When the Emperor Akihito expressed interest in abdicating, the Diet passed the Emperor Abdication Law in 2017, allowing for the 2019 Japanese imperial transition and the succession to the throne of Naruhito. In December 2022, in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and increased military cooperation between China and Russia, prime minister Fumio Kishida announced plans to significantly increase funding for the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

<text>The is the upper house of the National Diet of Japan. The House of Representatives is the lower house. The House of Councillors is the successor to the pre-war House of Peers. If the two houses disagree on matters of the budget, treaties, or the nomination of the prime minister, the House of Representatives can insist on its decision. In other decisions, the House of Representatives can override a vote of the House of Councillors only by a two-thirds majority of members present.

The House of Councillors has 248 members who each serve six-year terms, two years longer than those of the House of Representatives. Councillors must be at least 30 years old, compared with 25 years old in the House of Representatives. The House of Councillors cannot be dissolved, and terms are staggered so that only half of its membership is up for election every three years. Of the 121 members subject to election each time, 73 are elected from 45 districts by single non-transferable vote (SNTV) and 48 are elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation (PR) with open lists.

==Roles and responsibilities==

The power of House of Councillors is very similar to the Canadian Senate or the Irish Seanad. In central issues, there is a &quot;supremacy of the House of Representatives&quot; (:ja:衆議院の優越, &quot;Shūgiin no yūetsu&quot;). In the election of the prime minister, the ratification of international treaties, and on passing the budget, a decision by the House of Representatives always overrides dissent from the House of Councillors. Only the lower house can pass votes of no-confidence against the cabinet. All other legislation requires either the approval by majorities in both houses, an agreement in the conference committee of both houses or an additional override vote by two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. However, no single party has ever won a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives under the current constitution, although the LDP came close several times, as did the DPJ in 2009. In other words, controlling a majority in the House of Councillors and one third of the House of Representatives is enough for a united opposition to be able to block the passage of legislation. For certain important administrative nominations by the cabinet, the approval of both houses is required (although the laws containing this requirement could be changed by two-thirds lower house override as a &quot;nuclear option&quot;); and constitutional amendment proposals need two-thirds majorities in both the houses of the Diet to be submitted to the people in a national referendum.

One additional constitutional role of the House of Councillors is to serve as functioning fully elected emergency legislature on its own during lower house election campaigns: While the House of Representatives is dissolved, the National Diet can not be convened, and therefore no law can be passed in regular procedure; but in urgent cases requiring parliamentary action (e.g. election management, provisional budgets, disaster response), an emergency session (緊急集会, &quot;kinkyū shūkai&quot;) of the House of Councillors can still be invoked to take provisional decisions for the whole Diet. Such decisions will become invalid unless confirmed by the House of Representatives as soon as the whole Diet convenes again.

The basic stipulations on the role of the House of Councillors are subject of chapter IV of the constitution. Laws and rules containing more detailed provisions on parliamentary procedures and the relations between the two houses include the National Diet Law (国会法, &quot;Kokkai-hō&quot;), the conference committee regulations (両院協議会規程, &quot;ryōin-kyōgikai kitei&quot;), and the rules of each house (衆議院/参議院規則, &quot;Shūgiin/Sangiin kisoku&quot;).

=== Constitutional practice ===
In practice, governments often tried to ensure legislative majorities, either by forming coalition governments with safe legislative majorities in the first place or by negotiating with part of the opposition, or avoided to submit bills with no prospects of passage, so the House of Councillors rarely voted against the decisions reached by the lower house for much of postwar history: As the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), founded in 1955, often held majorities in both houses or was sufficiently close to control both houses together with independents and micro-parties for a long period, inter-chamber disagreement was rare during most of the 1955 System.

After the opposition victory in the 1989 election, the relative importance of the House of Councillors initially increased, as the LDP continued to govern alone and did not hold a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Crucial legislation had to be negotiated with parts of the opposition. The most prominent example was the so-called &quot;PKO Diet&quot; (:ja:PKO国会, &quot;PKO Kokkai&quot;) of 1992 when the LDP negotiated and passed the peace-keeping operations bill with centre-left/right-of-JSP opposition parties (DSP and Kōmeitō) against fierce opposition from JSP and JCP; the PKO law became the base for the Self-Defense Forces&#x27; first (ground) deployment abroad as part of the UN mission in Cambodia. After the 1993 House of Representatives election, with the exception of a brief minority government in 1994, coalition governments or the confidence and supply arrangement during the restored LDP single-party government ensured legislative government majorities until the opposition victory in the 1998 House of Councillors election which led to the formation of another coalition government by 1999.

The legislative two-thirds override power of the House of Representatives was never used between 1950s and 2008 when the LDP-Kōmeitō coalition government had lost the House of Councillors majority in the 2007 election, but did control a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives since 2005. After that, it has been used somewhat more frequently (see :ja:衆議院の再議決, &quot;Shūgin no saikaketsu&quot;, ~&quot;Override decisions by the House of Representatives&quot; for a list). If a government controls a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives and is willing to use it, the House of Councillors can only delay a bill, but not prevent passage.

Opposition control of the House of Councillors is often summarized by the term &quot;nejire Kokkai&quot; (:ja:ねじれ国会, &quot;twisted&quot; or &quot;skewed&quot; Diet). Setting aside the immediate postwar years, when many governments were in the minority in the upper house, but the strongest force, the centrist Ryokufūkai, was not in all-out opposition to either centre-left or centre-right governments and willing to cooperate, the Diet was &quot;twisted&quot; from 1989 to 1993, 1998–1999, 2007–2009, and most recently 2010–2013.

=== &quot;Gridlock&quot; and reform proposals ===
In recent years, many constitutional revision advocates call for reforming the role of the House of Councillors (&quot;carbon copy&quot; of the House of Representatives or &quot;recalcitrant naysayer&quot;) or abolishing it altogether to &quot;prevent political paralysis&quot;, after the recently more frequent twisted Diets have seen an increase in inter-chamber friction/&quot;political nightmare&quot;s. Examples of high-stakes, internationally noted conflicts in recent twisted Diets:
* In 2008, two nominees for BoJ governor by the Fukuda Cabinet (Toshirō Mutō, Kōji Tanami) were rejected by the DPJ-led opposition in the House of Councillors, and the SDF naval support mission for NATO/OEF in the Indian Ocean had to be interrupted for one month while the extension of the anti-terrorism law was delayed by the extended legislative proceedings necessary to override the House of Councillors rejection.
* In 2011, the Kan Cabinet struggled to pass a renewable energy bill and a bond ceiling increase (unlike the budget itself subject to the normal legislative procedure) against the LDP-led opposition majority in the House of Councillors until it negotiated a deal with the LDP in exchange for child allowance reform and the cabinet&#x27;s resignation which Kan had already announced, but conditioned on the passage of the bills.

==Membership and elections==

Article 102 of the Japanese Constitution provided that half of the councillors elected in the first House of Councillors election in 1947 would be up for re-election three years later in order to introduce staggered six-year terms.

The House initially had 250 seats. Two seats were added to the House in 1970 after the agreement on the repatriation of Okinawa, increasing the House to a total of 252. Legislation aimed at addressing malapportionment that favoured less populated prefectures was introduced in 2000; this resulted in ten seats being removed (five each at the 2001 and 2004 elections), bringing the total number of seats to 242. Further reforms to address malapportionment took effect in 2007 and 2016, but did not change the total number of members in the house.

From 1947 to 1983, the House had 100 seats allocated to a , of which fifty seats were allocated in each election. It was originally intended to give nationally prominent figures a route to the House without going through local electioneering processes. Some national political figures, such as feminists Shidzue Katō and Fusae Ichikawa and former Imperial Army general Kazushige Ugaki, were elected through the block, along with a number of celebrities such as comedian Yukio Aoshima (later Governor of Tokyo), journalist Hideo Den and actress Yūko Mochizuki. Shintaro Ishihara won a record 3 million votes in the national block in the 1968 election. The national block was last seen in the 1980 election and was replaced with a nationwide proportional representation block in the 1983 election. The national proportional representation block was reduced to 96 members in the 2000 reforms.

<doc id="217780" wikidata="Q7495073" url="?curid=217780" title="Sherlock Hemlock">
<text>Sherlock Hemlock (who calls himself &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest detective&quot;) is a Muppet character on the PBS series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. His catchphrase is &quot;Egad!&quot; which he exclaims whenever he makes a discovery. Sherlock Hemlock was performed by Jerry Nelson.

==Prevalence on the show==

While Sherlock Hemlock made frequent appearances on the show in the 1970s and 1980s, in recent years, he has been phased out in favor of newer characters. However, like Lefty the Salesman, Guy Smiley, and The Amazing Mumford, he is still a main character on &quot;Sesamstrasse&quot;, the German version of the show.

==Name and appearance==

Sherlock Hemlock is an obvious parody of Sherlock Holmes and the stereotypical detective. He wears a deerstalker hat and cloak, which Holmes is often depicted wearing, and often uses a magnifying glass like Holmes. However, his name is also a reference to hemlock, the poisonous plant used to kill the philosopher Socrates.

He appears to have been originally made from a green Anything Muppet.

==Famous skits==

Sherlock Hemlock is known for his humorous skits in which he tries to solve a mystery, only to discover that he is the culprit. A well-known example of this is the &quot;Chicken Salad Sandwich&quot; skit, originally aired in 1970, which was Sherlock&#x27;s first appearance. In this skit, Ernie opens his lunch box to find that half of his sandwich is missing, so he asks Sherlock Hemlock to help him figure out who took the missing half. After analyzing some clues like leftover bread crusts (&quot;many people think bread crust is yucky&quot; Sherlock says), they come to the conclusion that Sherlock ate half of the sandwich, and he asks for the other half as his reward. Another memorable sketch was the &quot;Twiddlebug Picnic Case&quot; when he deduced when the Twiddlebugs were having a picnic being interrupted by Herry Monster. One of his most famous segments is the song &quot;X Marks the Spot&quot; in which Sherlock sings about the letter &quot;X.&quot; The imagery of X-ray machines, a flashing railroad crossing, bottles of poison, and danger signs frightened many young viewers.

Sherlock Hemlock starred in all of the episodes of a former recurring &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segment, &quot;Mysterious Theater&quot; (hosted by Vincent Twice Vincent Twice), which is spoof of the TV series &quot;Mystery!&quot; (once hosted by Vincent Price). In these sketches, he is aided by a trusted companion, Watson (a dog performed by Kevin Clash), a spoof of Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s companion, Dr. Watson. Watson frequently solved the case long before Hemlock, but is unable to communicate this to his master, who wouldn&#x27;t find what Watson discovered until the end of each segment (very similar to &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;).

<text>Mr. Noodle and his siblings – (Mister Noodle, Ms. Noodle, and Miss Noodle in 1998–2009 and Mister Noodle, Mister Noodle and Miss Noodle in 2017–present) – are characters who appear in the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; segments during the educational children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Mr. Noodle was played by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had previously worked with Arlene Sherman, executive producer of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and co-creator of &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, in short films for the program. The first Mr. Noodle (played by Bill Irwin) is the oldest child of the Noodle siblings. 

When Irwin became unavailable due to him being busy with filming for &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, Sherman asked Michael Jeter, who was his friend, to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle&#x27;s brother Mister Noodle, which he accepted enthusiastically, calling it his favorite role in twenty years. Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, until his death in 2003. Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle&#x27;s sister Ms. Noodle, and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle&#x27;s other sister Miss Noodle. As of 2018, Daveed Diggs and Daniel Koren have played two more of Mr. Noodle&#x27;s brothers, as well as Ilana Glazer as Mr. Noodle&#x27;s other sister Miss Noodle.
Writer Louise A. Gikow calls the Noodles &quot;a dynasty of mimes...in the tradition of great silent film comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd&quot;. They made mistakes, but solved them with the help of &quot;enthusiastic kid voice overs&quot;, which empowered children and helped them feel smarter than the adults.

They were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. They would physically and humorously act out their replies to Elmo&#x27;s questions.

According to writer and &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; co-creator Judy Freudberg, &quot;Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he&#x27;s never seen one before. Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can&#x27;t&quot;. According to &quot;Sesame Street&quot; researcher Lewis Bernstein, the characters, whom he called &quot;bungling&quot;, gave young viewers &quot;the opportunity to figure it out&quot; before the adults did.

<text>The Sterile Cuckoo (released in the UK as Pookie) is a 1969 American comedy-drama film by producer-director Alan J. Pakula that tells the story of an eccentric young couple whose relationship deepens despite their differences and inadequacies. It stars Liza Minnelli, Wendell Burton, and Tim McIntire.

The film was adapted by Alvin Sargent from the 1965 novel by John Nichols, directed by Pakula in his directing debut, and was released by Paramount Pictures.

The film received two Oscar nominations for the 42nd Academy Awards: Liza Minnelli for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Fred Karlin and Dory Previn&#x27;s song &quot;Come Saturday Morning&quot; (performed by the Sandpipers) for Best Original Song.

==Plot==
Mary Ann (&quot;Pookie&quot;) Adams is a quirky oddball who meets quiet, reserved Jerry Payne while waiting for a bus heading to their colleges; both are first-year students and their colleges are near each other. Jerry notices that Pookie is different, unpredictable: she even lies to a nun on the bus so she can sit closer to him.

As Jerry settles into college life, the aggressive Pookie arrives unannounced one Saturday morning. The two spend time together over the weekend, and soon see each other regularly. Jerry falls for Pookie but their different personalities keep them apart. They agree to have sex. Later, Pookie tells Jerry she might be pregnant. When the pregnancy scare is over, Jerry decides to spend spring break alone to catch up on studies. But Pookie pleads with him to stay until he relents.

A week alone with the needy, somewhat unstable Pookie makes Jerry realize they need time apart. Later he discovers she has dropped out of school. In time, he finds her in the same boarding house she had rented the first time she visited him. He puts her on a bus for home and, for now, the young lovers part ways.

==Cast==
* Liza Minnelli as Mary Ann &quot;Pookie&quot; Adams

<doc id="217784" wikidata="Q735716" url="?curid=217784" title="The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland">
<text>The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (or simply Elmo in Grouchland) is a 1999 American musical adventure comedy film directed by Gary Halvorson (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay written by Mitchell Kriegman and Joey Mazzarino, based on a story conceived by Kriegman. This was the second of the two theatrical feature films to be based on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, after &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot; in 1985. It stars Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa Williams alongside Muppet performers Kevin Clash, Caroll Spinney, Steve Whitmire, and Frank Oz. It features songs written by a wide range of songwriters, including Siedah Garrett, Jeff Elmassian, Andy Rehfeldt, Martin Erskine, Seth Friedman, and Michael &amp; Patty Silversher, with a score composed and conducted by John Debney.

Produced by Jim Henson Pictures and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, the film was released by Columbia Pictures on October 1, 1999. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but was a box-office failure, grossing $12 million against a budget of more than $26 million.

The film was one of the few &quot;Sesame Street&quot; productions directly produced by The Jim Henson Company. This was the final Muppet feature film to involve Fran Brill and Oz, who retired from being full-time puppeteers the following years, and the last Muppet film to feature Spinney before his retirement in 2018 and his death in 2019.

==Plot==
One day, Elmo plays with his blanket in his bedroom in his apartment. He spills orange juice on his blanket and takes it to the laundromat. Afterward, he runs into his friend Zoe, who is feeling upset, so Elmo tries to cheer her up. Zoe wants to hold the blanket, but Elmo does not consent to sharing it, resulting in a tug of war that causes it to rip. Angry, Elmo declares to Zoe that she is not his friend anymore. Telly Monster, roller skating out of control, comes and accidentally swipes the blanket, leading to a chase around Sesame Street. The blanket ends up falling into the hands of Oscar the Grouch, who sneezes on it and drops it in his trash can. Unwilling to wait for Oscar to return, Elmo dives into the bottom of the trash can, where he finds his blanket snagged on a door.

Attempting to retrieve it, he and his blanket are then teleported through a colorful swirling tunnel to Grouchland, a city filled with Grouches, trash, and Huxley, a greedy man who loves to steal anything he comes across, including Elmo&#x27;s blanket. A kind Grouch girl named Grizzy tells Elmo that his blanket is in Huxley&#x27;s castle at the top of the faraway Mount Pickanose. A plant named Stuckweed encourages Elmo that he will make it if he just takes his first step, so Elmo sets out on a quest to retrieve his blanket.

With Oscar&#x27;s help, some of the Sesame Street residents (Zoe, Telly, Gordon, Maria, Cookie Monster, and Big Bird) go to Grouchland to find Elmo, but when they encounter a Grouch police officer and try to ask him for assistance, they end up getting arrested as they are informed that it is against the law to ask for help in Grouchland, and they get sent to jail.

Huxley has his bug sidekick, Bug, and his henchmen, the Pesties, trap Elmo in a cave. Elmo gets out with the help of fireflies who show him a way out. Huxley then has Bug and the Pesties misdirect Elmo into a garbage dump where he is brought before the Queen of Trash for trespassing. Her citizens think that he might be a spy for Huxley, so the Queen tests Elmo, requesting that he blows 100 raspberries for her in 30 seconds. Elmo succeeds with some help from the audience and the Queen allows him to pass through. Huxley sends in a giant chicken to stop Elmo, who tosses Elmo far away. Elmo decides to give up on retrieving his blanket for the night. Meanwhile, Grizzy sneaks into the jail where she informs Elmo&#x27;s friends that he has gone to Huxley&#x27;s castle. After admitting that Elmo is his friend, Oscar convinces all the Grouches to cooperate, since it is the only way they can stop Huxley from stealing any more of their trash. The police officer releases the Sesame Street residents so they and the Grouches can go to Huxley&#x27;s castle to fight for their trash and rescue Elmo.

The next morning, a caterpillar wakes Elmo up and convinces him that he has what it takes to be brave. Elmo arrives at Huxley&#x27;s castle and rescues his blanket as Huxley sends the Pesties to stop him. Elmo falls into a basket as Huxley decides to make him and his blanket both his property by using a claw to put them on his conveyor stamper. The Sesame Street and Grouchland citizens arrive and Huxley tries to escape with Elmo&#x27;s blanket, only to have the blanket sucked up with the vacuum cleaner nozzle on his helicopter. Elmo launches a basket over Huxley&#x27;s shoulders, incapacitating him. Bug, who has been sympathetic to Elmo, is revealed to be at the controls of the helicopter, and refuses Huxley&#x27;s demand for the blanket, instead returning it to Elmo.

Elmo returns to Sesame Street with his friends, where he apologizes to Zoe and allows her to hold his blanket. She accepts his apology, agreeing that they can resume their friendship. Elmo says goodbye to the audience, thanking them for helping.

==Production==
===Casting===

All the puppeteers who performed the primary &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters (such as Kevin Clash, Jerry Nelson, Caroll Spinney and Fran Brill) were called to Wilmington, North Carolina for the table read on May 19, 1998. The regular puppets were used for the normal Sesame Street characters, and puppets for assorted Grouches (including Grizzy) were designed and built by Mark Zezsotek. Paul Andrejco, Muppet designer for &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot;, also designed Humungous Chicken. Sonia Manzano reprised her role as Maria and Roscoe Orman reprised his role as Gordon. Vanessa Williams was cast as the Queen of Trash and the hairstylist colored her hair green for the role. Mandy Patinkin was a last-minute replacement for Harland Williams who was originally cast to play Huxley. For the role, the makeup artist designed false eyebrows for Patinkin to wear to make him seem like he had bushier eyebrows than normal.

===Filming===
The film was shot over a 30-day period (starting May 26, 1998) at the EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington. The set was raised so that puppeteers would be able to stand up instead of squatting below street level like usual. Filming wrapped and visual effects by D.Rez were added during the following month, and the Ernie and Bert scenes were later shot in New York in 1999, with Matt Vogel assisting Steve Whitmire in performing Ernie and Eric Jacobson assisting Frank Oz with Bert.

<text>Chicago Hope was an American medical drama television series created by David E. Kelley, that aired for six seasons on CBS from September 18, 1994, to May 4, 2000, with a total of 141 episodes. The series is set in a fictional private charitable hospital in Chicago, Illinois.

==Overview==
The show starred Mandy Patinkin as Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, a hot-shot surgeon with emotional issues stemming from the psychiatric condition of his wife (played by Kim Greist), who drowned their infant son. Adam Arkin plays Dr. Aaron Shutt, a world-renowned neurosurgeon and Geiger&#x27;s best friend. Thomas Gibson played Dr. Daniel Nyland, a promiscuous ER doctor and trauma surgeon who was later suspended due to his having an affair with a patient&#x27;s family member and later was injured in a car crash. Dr. Keith Wilkes played by Rocky Carroll, often clashed with Nyland and was known for his back-to-basics and rough demeanor. He was good friends with Peter Berg&#x27;s character, Dr. Billy Kronk. Kronk was known for his cowboyish demeanor and known to be very cocky, as showed in an episode where he cuts off a man&#x27;s injured leg with a chainsaw in a scene where Kronk helps out at an accident site. Peter MacNicol, Alan Rosenberg, and Héctor Elizondo feature as the hospital&#x27;s in-house attorneys and chief of staff, respectively. Christine Lahti joined in the second season as Dr. Kate Austin, a talented heart surgeon with a chip on her shoulder, vying with Geiger for the chief of surgery position. She was known fighting in a custody battle with her malicious ex-husband and businessman, Tommy Wilmette, played by Ron Silver. Mr. Wilmette did everything he could to get Austin to lose custody of their daughter. He purchased the hospital at the end of Season 2. Dr. Austin is suspended because she and her daughter go AWOL on a trip to New Zealand. Mr. Wilmette was upset because it took him three months to find his ex-wife and daughter. In Season 3, the doctors want Mr. Wilmette to sell the hospital and the doctors would run it. The doctors viewed that Wilmette didn&#x27;t know how to run a hospital and cut too many costs that involved patient care. Mr. Wilmette later met with Senator Kennedy at the White House to talk about Healthcare Reform. In Season 2, Geiger resigns from Chicago Hope after trying to save Alan Birch from a deadly gunshot wound to his heart.

Geiger adopted Birch&#x27;s baby daughter. Geiger later rejoins the doctors at the end of Season 5 when he becomes Chairman of the Board and fires half of the doctors. In Season 4, Dr. Shutt became a psychiatrist and temporarily loses his ability to operate after suffering from a brain aneurysm. In Season 6, Shutt returns to Neurosurgery and works alongside Carla Gugino&#x27;s character, Dr. Gina Simon.

==Episodes==

&quot;Chicago Hope&quot; ran six seasons, airing a total of 141 episodes.
===Crossovers===
Fyvush Finkel and Kathy Baker appeared as their &quot;Picket Fences&quot; characters in the first season. Likewise, Mandy Patinkin and Héctor Elizondo brought their &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; characters to &quot;Picket Fences&quot; that year. Both Adam Arkin and Lauren Holly had previously appeared on &quot;Picket Fences&quot; as a lawyer and as a deputy sheriff, respectively.

Mandy Patinkin appears in an uncredited role as Geiger in a 1995 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; producer John Tinker shot this footage as a favor to his &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; colleague Tom Fontana.

&quot;Chicago Hope&quot; characters crossed over to &quot;Early Edition&quot; early in that show&#x27;s run. Rocky Carroll, Jayne Brook, and Héctor Elizondo all guest-starred in scenes taking place in the hospital.

==Characters==

==Production==
With the exception of some infrequent on-location scenes, the vast majority of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; was filmed on sound stages at the studios of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, located in the Century City area of Los Angeles.
Three of the cast (Harmon, Carroll and Holly) would later go on to star together in &quot;NCIS&quot;.

===Firsts===
The series broke a network television taboo by showing a teenager&#x27;s breast after her character underwent reconstructive surgery. This was generally seen as relevant to the subject matter and went relatively uncriticized.

On November 18, 1998, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; became the first regular series episode to be broadcast in HDTV. The episode was entitled &quot;The Other Cheek&quot;.

Mark Harmon&#x27;s character uttered the word &quot;shit&quot; during a trauma. Little criticism was made, although it did inspire the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;It Hits the Fan&quot;.

==Broadcast==

===Domestic reruns===
Reruns of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; aired on Pop (then the TV Guide Network) from 2010 to 2012. OWN also aired reruns of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; on a semi-regular basis.

===International===
In the UK, seasons 1 and 2 originally aired on BBC One. More recently, all seasons of the show have been shown on ITV3. Starting on September 3, 2007, it began airing on Zone Romantica in the UK and Ireland. It was also shown on Sky One in the UK and Ireland in its prime-time slots. In Australia, the series originally aired on the Seven Network. In Germany the first seasons were shown in the 1990s. In Hungary, the series aired on Viasat3. In Indonesia, the series originally aired on RCTI, starting from October 1998 ended from July 2002. As of November 2013, it was airing on British channel True Entertainment. In New Zealand, the series originally aired on TV2, now TVNZ 2.

==Home media==
Revelation Films has released all 6 seasons of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; on DVD in Region 2 (UK) for the first time.

==Reception==
The pilot episode of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; aired the day before NBC&#x27;s &quot;ER&quot; in a special Sunday, 8p.m. time slot. After the first week, however, the two Chicago-based hospital dramas went &quot;head to head&quot; in their primetime 10p.m. Thursday night slot. &quot;ER&quot; was the victor: its first season proved a ratings winner. Despite receiving critical acclaim, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; was shifted to 9p.m. Thursdays, and ultimately to Monday nights in 1995 in a bid for higher ratings, while &quot;ER&quot; remained in its time slot.

&quot;Chicago Hope&quot; remained in the Monday slot and performed well, with ratings peaking at 11.9, with a 20 share. In the second season, however, Kelley and Patinkin decided to leave the show. The show was moved to Wednesdays at 10p.m. in 1997 to make room for the Steven Bochco drama,&quot; Brooklyn South&quot;, on Mondays. In 1999, both Kelley and Patinkin returned, with a revamped cast now including Barbara Hershey and Lauren Holly, but excluding Lahti, Peter Berg, Jayne Brook, Vondie Curtis-Hall, and Stacy Edwards. CBS also moved the show back to Thursday nights, against NBC&#x27;s &quot;Frasier&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. The show was canceled in May 2000.

In 2008, former co-stars Rocky Carroll (Dr. Keith Wilkes); Mark Harmon (Dr. Jack McNeil) and Lauren Holly (Dr. Jeremy Hanlon) worked together on the series &quot;NCIS&quot;. Holly left the show after three seasons, while Carroll remains with the cast today. Harmon would depart in 2021. In addition, Carroll has a recurring role as his &quot;NCIS&quot; character, Director Leon Vance, on that series&#x27;s spin off, &quot;&quot;. Jayne Brook (Dr. Diane Grad) and Stacy Edwards have also guest starred on &quot;NCIS&quot; as well.

Thomas Gibson would later star alongside Patinkin in the highly successful &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, as well as Shemar Moore who was a guest star on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; during Season 4. Patinkin later left the show early in its third season.

===Nielsen ratings===
Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
Over its six seasons, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; was nominated for many accolades and won several, including seven Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Awards.

<text>Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục () (6 October 1897 – 13 December 1984) was a Vietnamese Catholic prelate who served as the Archbishop of Huế in the Republic of Vietnam from 1960 until 1968. He later lived in exile in Europe due to unrest in his country and became a sedevacantist bishop who was excommunicated twice by the Holy See of the Roman Catholic Church but is believed to have reconciled with the Holy See before his death in 1984.

He was a member of the Ngô family who ruled South Vietnam in the years leading up to the Vietnam War and was the founder of Dalat University. While Thục was in Rome attending the second session of the Second Vatican Council, the 1963 South Vietnamese coup overthrew and assassinated his younger brothers, Ngô Đình Diệm (who was president of South Vietnam) and Ngô Đình Nhu. Thục was unable to return to Vietnam and lived the rest of his life exiled in Italy, France, and the United States. During his exile, he was involved with Traditionalist Catholic movements and consecrated a number of bishops without the Vatican&#x27;s approval for the Palmarian and Sedevacantist movements. Today, various Independent Catholic and sedevacantist groups claim to have derived their apostolic succession from Thục.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===

Ngô Đình Thục was born on 6 October 1897, in Huế, French Indochina, to an affluent Roman Catholic family as the second of the six surviving sons born to Ngô Đình Khả, a mandarin of the Nguyễn dynasty who served Emperor Thành Thái during the French occupation of Vietnam.

Thục&#x27;s elder brother, Khôi, served as a governor and mandarin of the French-controlled Emperor Bảo Đại&#x27;s administration. At the end of World War Two, both Khôi and Thục&#x27;s younger brother Diệm were arrested for having collaborated with the Japanese. Diệm was released, but Khôi was subsequently shot by the Việt Minh as part of the August Revolution of 1945 (and not buried alive as is sometimes stated). Thục&#x27;s brothers Diệm, Nhu and Cẩn, were politically active. Cardinal François Xavier Nguyễn Văn Thuận (1928–2002) was Thục&#x27;s nephew.

===Priesthood and early episcopacy===

At age twelve, Thục entered the minor seminary in An Ninh. He spent eight years there before going on to study philosophy at the major seminary in Huế. Following his ordination as a priest on 20 December 1925, he was selected to study theology in Rome, and is often said to have earned three doctorates from the Pontifical Gregorian University in philosophy, theology, and Canon law; this is not substantiated by the university&#x27;s archives however. He briefly lectured at the Sorbonne and gained teaching qualifications before returning to Vietnam in 1927.

On 8 January 1938, Pope Pius XI created the Apostolic Vicariate of Vĩnh Long in Vietnam, and personally chose Thục (then aged 41) to be it its first Vicar Apostolic. On 4 May of the same year, with his family in attendance, Thục was consecrated a bishop by Archbishop Antonin Drapier, Apostolic Delegate to Indochina, and co-consecrators Bishop Isidore-Marie-Joseph Dumortier, M.E.P., Vicar Apostolic of Saigon, and Bishop Dominique Maria Hồ Ngọc Cẩn, Vicar Apostolic of Bùi Chu.

In 1950 Diệm and Thục applied for permission to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican but went instead to Japan to lobby Prince Cường Để to enlist support to seize power. They met Wesley Fishel, an American academic consultant for the U.S. government. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed by Diệm. He helped the brothers organise contacts and meetings in the United States to enlist support.

With the outbreak of the Korean War and the onset of McCarthyism in the early 1950s, Vietnamese anti-communists were a sought-after commodity in the United States. Diệm and Thục were given a reception at the State Department with the Acting Secretary of State James Webb, where Thục did much of the talking. Diệm and Thục also forged links with Cardinal Francis Spellman, the most politically influential cleric of his time, and Spellman became one of Diệm&#x27;s most powerful advocates. Diệm then managed an audience with Pope Pius XII in Rome with his brother&#x27;s help, and then settled in the US as a guest of the Maryknoll Fathers. Spellman helped Diệm to garner support among right-wing and Catholic circles. Thục was widely seen as more genial, loquacious, and diplomatic than his brother, and it was acknowledged that Thục would be highly influential in the future regime. As French power in Vietnam declined, Diệm&#x27;s support in America, which Thục helped to nurture, made his stock rise. Emperor Bảo Đại made Diệm the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam because he thought Diệm&#x27;s connections would secure foreign financial aid.

===Diệm&#x27;s rule===

In October 1955, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum organised by Nhu and declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam, which then concentrated power in the Ngô family, who were dedicated Roman Catholics in a Buddhist majority country. Power was enforced through secret police and the imprisonment and torture of political and religious opponents. The Ngôs&#x27; policies and conduct inflamed religious tensions. The government was biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as the allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions. Thục, the most powerful religious leader in the country, was allowed to solicit &quot;voluntary contributions to the Church&quot; from Saigon businessmen, which was likened to &quot;tax notices&quot;. Thục also used his position to acquire farms, businesses, urban real estate, rental property and rubber plantations for the Catholic Church. He also used Army of the Republic of Vietnam personnel to work on his timber and construction projects.

On 24 November 1960, Thục was appointed Archbishop of Huế by Pope John XXIII.

===Buddhist unrest and downfall of Diệm===
In May 1963, in the central city of Huế, Buddhists were prohibited from displaying the Buddhist flag during Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha, when the government cited a regulation prohibiting the display of non-government flags at Thục&#x27;s request. A few days earlier, Catholics were encouraged to fly flags to celebrate Thục&#x27;s 25th anniversary as bishop, but were ordered by Diem&#x27;s government to fly Vietnamese flags as more important. Government funds were used to pay for Thục&#x27;s anniversary celebrations, and the residents of Huế—a Buddhist stronghold—were also forced to contribute. These perceived double standards led to a Buddhist protest against the government. Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang proclaimed a five-point &quot;manifesto of the monks&quot; that demanded freedom to fly the Buddhist flag, religious equality between Buddhists and Catholics, compensation for the victims&#x27; families, an end to arbitrary arrests, and punishment of the officials responsible. The protest was ended when nine civilians were killed because of a bomb, Diem government accused the Viet Cong being responsible . American journalists, who supported American intervention in Vietnam and opposed Diem for opposing it, blamed the military and even Archbishop Thuc for the deaths, Later, the Ngôs&#x27; forces entered the Buddhist pagodas across the country. The synchronized military operations, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Viet Cong infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.

Diệm was overthrown and assassinated together with Nhu on 2 November 1963. Ngô Đình Cẩn was sentenced to death and executed in 1964. Of the six brothers, only Thục and Luyện survived the political upheavals in Vietnam. Luyện, the youngest, was serving as ambassador in London, and Thục had been summoned to Rome for the Second Vatican Council. Because of the coup, Thục remained in Rome during the Council years (1962–65). He was among the bishops who were against the statements of the council.

===Beginning of exile===

After the closing of the Second Vatican Council, none of the relevant governments – American, Vietnamese or the Vatican – consented to Thục returning to Vietnam.

According to Thục, the Americans forced the South Vietnamese government to refuse him permission to return, and that Paul VI used this inability to return to force him to resign and appoint Bishop Philippe Nguyễn Kim Điền, one of Paul VI&#x27;s favorites, as his replacement.

He began his exile in Rome.

===Consecrations of bishops and declaration of sedevacantism===

A Swiss priest Thục formerly knew in Écône, Switzerland, Father Maurice Revaz, former Chancellor of the Swiss Diocese of Sion and professor of canon law in Ecône at the International Seminary of Saint Pius X of the traditionalist Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), came to Thục and invited him to go to Spain, saying that the Blessed Virgin Mary wanted him to render her a service. On 1 January 1976, in El Palmar de Troya, Spain, Thục ordained Clemente Domínguez y Gómez — who claimed to have repeatedly witnessed apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary — and others as priests for the Carmelites of the Holy Face (later the Palmarian Catholic Church), and on 11 January 1976, consecrated Dominguez and four others as bishops. When news of the illcit consecrations became public, Thục, Domínguez and all other consecrated Bishops were excommunicated by Pope Paul VI. Thục stated that he had gone to Palmar de Troya on the spur of the moment, though contemporary sources show him to have been a regular visitor since 1968.

After Domínguez proclaimed himself Pope with the name of &quot;Gregory XVII&quot;, Thục distanced himself from the Palmarian sect, apologized for his actions and reconciled with the Catholic Church.

On 7 May 1981, Thục consecrated the sedeprivationist priest Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers as a bishop. Des Lauriers was a Dominican theologian, an expert on the dogma of the Assumption, and an advisor to Pope Pius XII. On 17 October, Thục consecrated the two Mexican sedevacantist priests and former seminary professors Moisés Carmona and Adolfo Zamora as bishops. Carmona and Zamora were among the priests who formed the &quot;Unión Católica Trento&quot; (Tridentine Catholic Union).

On 21 March, &quot;Laetare&quot; Sunday, he publicly proclaimed this declaration during a Pontifical High Mass in &quot;Sankt Michael&quot; Church in Munich.

In response to his episcopal consecrations for the sedevacantists in Toulon in 1981 and to his declaration of sedevacantism, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith again declared him &quot;ipso facto&quot; excommunicated.

His newly consecrated bishops did not form a united structure and organization, but became a fragmented group, many limiting themselves essentially to sacramental ministry and only consecrated a few other bishops for various sedevacantist priests or groups.

In 1982, Thuc declared:

In 1983, Thục departed for the United States at the invitation of Bishop Louis Vezelis, an American Franciscan former missionary priest who later became a sedevacantist bishop. Vezelis was consecrated a bishop by the American sedevacantist Bishop George J. Musey (consecrated in 1982 by Carmona) and by co-consecrators Carmona and Zamora (the two Mexican sedevacantist bishops Thục consecrated on 17 October 1981). Thục collaborated with Vezelis in the operation of a seminary in Rochester, New York, United States.

===Reconciliation and death===

Thục began to be increasingly sought out by the expatriate and refugee Vietnamese community, including old friends and contacts from Huế and Saigon. They facilitated his extraction from sedevacantism and Thục returned to the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church definitively in 1984. He later came to stay with the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix in Carthage, Missouri and later celebrated a Mass during the Marian Days celebration there, which continually brings together thousands of the Vietnamese American community for worship and community.

Thục did reconciled with the Church on 11 July 1984 and died on 13 December of the same year, at the age of 87. He was buried in the Resurrection Cemetery in Springfield, Missouri.
