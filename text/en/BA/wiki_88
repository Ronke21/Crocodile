<text>The 5th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met at Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 4, 1797, to March 4, 1799, during the first two years of John Adams&#x27; presidency. In the context of the Quasi-War with France, the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed by Congress. The Acts were overwhelmingly supported by the Federalists and mostly opposed by the Democratic-Republicans. Some Democratic-Republicans, such as Timothy Bloodworth, said they would support formally going to war against France but they opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts which Bloodworth and others believed were unconstitutional.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1790 United States census. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.


==Major events==

*March 4, 1797 – John Adams became President of the United States 
*July 8, 1797 – The Senate expelled Tennessee Senator William Blount for conspiring with the British
*July 11, 1798 – The United States Marine Corps was established
*XYZ Affair in the U.S., followed by naval skirmishes but no war is declared. The XYZ affair led to several Democratic-Republicans breaking ranks with Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson took pains to avoid blaming France for the incident, as a result John Hunter, Josiah Tattnall, Timothy Bloodworth, Alexander Martin, Lemuel Benton, Thomas Sumter, William Smith, John Milledge, Abraham Baldwin, Joseph McDowell, Matthew Locke, Robert Williams, Richard Stanford, Nathaniel Macon, James Gillespie, Dempsey Burges, Thomas Blount, Nathan Bryan, John Brown, Thomas T. Davis, John Fowler and Joseph Anderson all publicly broke ranks with Jefferson, despite the fact he was the de facto leader of their party, and sided with Alexander Hamilton. The aforementioned congressmen and senators were referred to by Jefferson as a &quot;reign of witches&quot; and were described as the &quot;Pro-British republicans&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;pro-French republicans&quot; led by Jefferson).

==Major legislation==

* April 7, 1798: Mississippi Organic Act (&quot;An Act for an amicable settlement of limits with the state of Georgia, and authorizing the establishment of a government in the Mississippi territory&quot;), Sess. 2, ch. 28, 
* April 30, 1798: The U.S. Department of the Navy was established, Sess. 2, ch. 35, 
* June 18, 1798: Alien and Sedition Acts: (&quot;An Act to establish a uniform rule of naturalization&quot;) (Naturalization Act of 1798), Sess. 2, ch. 54, 
* June 25, 1798: Alien and Sedition Acts: (&quot;An Act concerning Aliens&quot;), Sess. 2, ch. 58, 
* July 6, 1798: Alien and Sedition Acts: (&quot;An Act respecting Alien Enemies&quot;), Sess. 2, ch. 66, 
* July 9, 1798: Act Further to Protect the Commerce of the United States, Sess. 2, ch. 68, 
* July 11, 1798: The United States Marine Corps was established, Sess. 2, ch. 72, 
* July 14, 1798: Alien and Sedition Acts: (&quot;An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States&quot;) (Sedition Act), Sess. 2, ch. 74, 
* July 16, 1798: Marine Hospital Service Act (&quot;An Act for the relief of sick and disabled Seamen&quot;), Sess. 2, ch. 77, 

== Treaties ratified ==

* June 7, 1797: Treaty of Tripoli between the United States and Tripoli.
* July 7, 1797: Existing treaties with France were rescinded, Sess. 2, ch. 67,

<text>The 6th United States Congress was the 6th meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It initially met at Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and then was the first congress to meet in the new Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.. Its term was from March 4, 1799, to March 4, 1801, during the last two years of John Adams&#x27;s presidency. It was the last Congress of the 18th century and the first to convene in the 19th. The apportionment of seats in House of Representatives was based on the 1790 United States census. Both chambers had a Federalist majority. This was the last Congress in which the Federalist Party controlled the presidency or either chamber of Congress.
==Major events==

* December 14, 1799: Former President George Washington died
* February 24, 1800: Library of Congress founded
* November 17, 1800: Congress held its first session in Washington, D.C.
* January 20, 1801: John Marshall was appointed Chief Justice of the United States
* February 17, 1801: 1800 United States presidential election: Thomas Jefferson became the first President of the United States elected by the House of Representatives as no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes cast in the 1800 presidential election. The House was required to choose between Jefferson and Aaron Burr, with each of the 16 states having a single vote. Jefferson was elected on the 36th ballot by 10 to 4 (with 2 abstentions).

==Major legislation==

* April 4, 1800: Bankruptcy Act of 1800, Sess. 1, ch. 19, 
* May 7, 1800: Indiana Organic Act, Sess. 1, ch. 41, ; effective July 4, 1800
* May 10, 1800: Slave Trade Act of 1800, Sess. 2, ch. 51, 
* February 13, 1801: Judiciary Act of 1801, Sess. 2, ch. 4,

<text>The 7th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1801, to March 4, 1803, during the first two years of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 1790 United States census. Both chambers had a Democratic-Republican majority, except when the Senate held a two-day Special Senate session in order to provide advice to the new President Thomas Jefferson, when there was still a Federalist majority in the Senate.
==Major events==

* March 4, 1801: Thomas Jefferson became President of the United States.
* May 10, 1801: The pascha of Tripoli declared war on United States by having the flagpole on the consulate chopped down
* March 16, 1802: West Point established
* February 24, 1803: First time an Act of Congress was declared unconstitutional: U.S. Supreme Court case, &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;

==Major legislation==

* April 29, 1802: Judiciary Act of 1802, ch. 31, 
* April 30, 1802: Enabling Act of 1802, ch. 40, 

==States admitted==

* Ohio was admitted as a state, having previously been a portion of the Northwest Territory. The exact date is unclear and in dispute, but it is undisputed that it was during this Congress. The official date when Ohio became a state was not set until 1953, when the 83rd U.S. Congress passed legislation retrospectively designating the date of the first meeting of the Ohio state legislature, March 1, 1803, as that date. However, on April 30, 1802, the 7th U.S. Congress had passed an act &quot;authorizing the inhabitants of Ohio to form a Constitution and state government, and admission of Ohio into the Union.&quot; (Sess. 1, ch. 40, ) On February 19, 1803, the same Congress passed an act &quot;providing for the execution of the laws of the United States in the State of Ohio.&quot; (Sess. 2, ch. 7, ) The Biographical Directory of the United States Congress states that Ohio was admitted to the Union on November 29, 1802, and counts its seats as vacant from that date.

==Party summary==
The count below identifies party affiliations at the beginning of the first session of this Congress, and includes members from vacancies and newly admitted states, when they were first seated. Changes resulting from subsequent replacements are shown below in the &quot;Changes in membership&quot; section.

=== Senate ===
The Federalists still controlled the Senate when they held a two-day special Senate session in March 1801, which was called by outgoing President John Adams so that the Senate could provide advice to the new President Thomas Jefferson, but by the time Congress began its first regular session in December 1801 to start official business, the Democratic-Republicans had gained Senate control.

=== House of Representatives ===

==Leadership==

===Senate===

<text>A law society is an association of lawyers with a regulatory role that includes the right to supervise the training, qualifications, and conduct of lawyers. Where there is a distinction between barristers and solicitors, solicitors are regulated by the law societies and barristers by a separate bar council.

== History ==
Much has changed for law societies in recent years, with governments in Australia, New Zealand, England, Wales, and Scotland creating government sponsored regulators for lawyers (both barristers and solicitors), leaving to law societies the role of advocacy on behalf of their members.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, each province and territory has a law society () with statutory responsibility for regulation of the legal profession in the public interest. These law societies are members of the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, which seeks to increase coordination between its members and encourage the standardization of members&#x27; rules and procedures.

In Canada&#x27;s common law jurisdictions, lawyers are both barristers and solicitors. Consequently, there is one law society per province or territory to regulate and represent the interests of legal professionals.

In Quebec, Canada&#x27;s only civil law jurisdiction, the legal profession is split between legal advocates, governed by the Bar of Quebec, and civil law notaries, governed by the Chamber of Notaries of Quebec.

=== United Kingdom ===
The 1739/40 Society of Gentleman Practisers in the Courts of Law and Equity has been described as the first law society in the United Kingdom. However its relationship to the modern Law Society of England and Wales (founded 1825) is unclear.

=== United States ===
In the United States, unified bar associations are somewhat similar to law societies; however, there are differences between law societies and the general American phenomenon of bar associations. Usually a bar association is an association of lawyers; lawyers may or may not join as they wish. Regulation of American lawyers usually takes places through the courts, which decide who gets admitted as a lawyer, and also decide discipline cases. Law societies are often created by legislation and play (or played) significant direct roles in the training, licensing and disciplining of lawyers. The conflict or roles between being a regulator and a trade association is seen by many as giving rise to the recent move to government sponsored regulators.

Law societies also play a role as part of the justice system, and concern themselves with access to justice. As a result, they may offer paid and unpaid legal assistance to the public or specific target audiences, and have historically been involved in the development of legal aid plans.

=== Australia ===
Law Societies in Australia represent the interests of solicitors and are organised in each State and mainland territory. Australia has a split profession, and barristers&#x27; interests are represented by separately-organised Bar Councils in each State and territory. The Law Council of Australia is a peak body representing the interests of all legal practitioners at federal level.

<text>Oghene, is the supreme god of the Urhobo and Isoko people in southern Nigeria. He is believed to have created the world and all peoples. Oghene is beyond human comprehension and is only known by his actions. Because the god is so distant and unknown, he has no temples or priests and no prayers or sacrifices are offered directly to him.

Oghene has a courier named Oyise, who is referred to as &quot;uko Oghene&quot; or &quot;messenger of Oghene&quot;. Through Oyise, Oghene can be invoked in case of calamity or need.
The Etsako speaking people of Northern Edo state, Nigeria also call God or the supreme entity Oghena, which is very similar to Oghene, this is not unrelated to the shared ancestry or cultural interrelatedness of various indigenous groups to the ancient Benin empire which was dominant in that current space of Southern Nigeria.</text><links>

<text>Eleanor of England (; – 31 October 1214), was Queen of Castile and Toledo as the wife of Alfonso VIII of Castile. She was the sixth child and second daughter of Henry II, King of England, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. She served as Regent of Castile during the minority of her son Henry I for 26 days between the death of her spouse and her own death in 1214. Her great-granddaughter and namesake, Eleanor of Castile, married the future Edward I of England in 1254.

==Early life and family==
Eleanor was born in the castle at Domfront, Normandy c. 1161, as the second daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, who she was named after. She was baptised by Henry of Marcy and her godparents at her baptism were Achard, bishop of Avranches, and the abbot of Le Mont Saint Michel, Robert of Torigni.

Her full siblings were Henry the Young King, Duchess Matilda of Saxony, King Richard I, Duke Geoffrey II of Brittany, Queen Joan of Sicily and King John. Her half-siblings were Countess Marie of Champagne and Countess Alix of Blois. Eleanor had an older brother, William (17 August 1153April 1156), the first son of Henry II, and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who died of a seizure at Wallingford Castle, and was buried in Reading Abbey at the feet of his great-grandfather Henry I.

In 1165 her marriage was arranged to Frederick V, Duke of Swabia, the oldest son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy, but he died before the marriage was able to take place.

==Queenship==

In 1170 Eleanor married King Alfonso VIII of Castile in Burgos at the age of 9. Her parents&#x27; purpose in arranging the marriage was to secure Aquitaine&#x27;s Pyrenean border, while Alfonso sought an ally in his struggles with Sancho VI of Navarre. In 1177, this led to Henry overseeing arbitration of the border dispute.

Around 1200, Alfonso began to claim that the duchy of Gascony was part of Eleanor&#x27;s dowry, but there is no documented foundation for that claim. It is highly unlikely that Henry II would have parted with so significant a portion of his domains. At most, Gascony may have been pledged as security for the full payment of his daughter&#x27;s dowry. Her husband went so far on this claim as to invade Gascony in her name in 1205. In 1206, her brother John granted her safe passage to visit him, perhaps to try opening peace negotiations. In 1208, Alfonso yielded on the claim. Decades later, their great-grandson Alfonso X of Castile would claim the duchy on the grounds that her dowry had never been fully paid.

Of all Eleanor of Aquitaine&#x27;s daughters, her namesake was the only one who was enabled, by political circumstances, to wield the kind of influence her mother had exercised. In her marriage treaty, and in the first marriage treaty for her daughter Berengaria, Eleanor was given direct control of many lands, towns, and castles throughout the kingdom, including major towns like Aguilar de Campóo, Logroño, and Calahorra. She was almost as powerful as Alfonso, who specified in his will in 1204 that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death, including taking responsibility for paying his debts and executing his will. It was she who persuaded him to marry their daughter Berengaria to Alfonso IX of León.

Troubadours and sages were regularly present in Alfonso VIII&#x27;s court due to Eleanor&#x27;s patronage. The Catalan poet, Ramon Vidal de Besalu, wrote about Eleanor and described her as wrapped in a red silk mantle with Angevin lions, and Guillem de Bergued addressed a poem to her.

Eleanor took a particular interest in supporting religious institutions. In 1179, she took responsibility to support and maintain the shrine to St. Thomas Becket in the cathedral of Toledo, which had been founded by Count Nuño Peréz de Lara and his wife Teresa Fernández in 1177. She made gifts to the abbeys of Grandmont and Fontevraud. She also created and supported the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, outside the city of Burgos, and its affiliated hospital for pilgrims, the Hospital del Rey. It served as a refuge and tomb for her family for generations, and her daughter Constance took the veil there and became known as the Lady of Las Huelgas.

==Regent==
When Alfonso died, Eleanor was reportedly so devastated with grief that she was unable to preside over the burial. Their eldest daughter Berengaria instead performed these honours. In accordance with the will of her late spouse, Eleanor became regent of Castile during the minority of her son, in which her daughter acted as her advisor. Her reign was not to be long, however; she was reportedly not in good enough health and left most of the affairs of state to her daughter, which created fear and opposition among the nobles that she was planning to leave the regency to her daughter.

Eleanor later became sick and died only twenty-six days after her husband, and was buried at Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas.

==Children==
==Later depictions==
Eleanor was praised for her beauty and regal nature by the poet Ramón Vidal de Besalú after her death. Her great-grandson Alfonso X referred to her as &quot;noble and much loved&quot;.

Eleanor was played by actress Ida Norden in the silent film &quot;The Jewess of Toledo&quot;.

<doc id="224866" wikidata="Q561670" url="?curid=224866" title="Arthur Young (agriculturist)">
<text>Arthur Young FRS (11 September 1741 – 12 April 1820) was an English agriculturist. Not himself successful as a farmer, he built on connections and activities as a publicist a substantial reputation as an expert on agricultural improvement. After the French Revolution of 1789, his views on its politics carried weight as an informed observer, and he became an important opponent of British reformers. 

Young is considered a major English writer on agriculture and an early contributor to agricultural economics, although he is best known as a social and political observer. Also read widely were his &quot;Tour in Ireland&quot; (1780) and &quot;Travels in France&quot; (1792).

==Early life==
Young was born in 1741 at Whitehall, London, the second son of Anna Lucretia Coussmaker, and her husband Arthur Young, who was rector of Bradfield Combust in Suffolk and chaplain to Arthur Onslow. After attending school at Lavenham from 1748, he was in 1758 placed at Messrs Robertson, a mercantile house in King&#x27;s Lynn. His sister Elizabeth Mary, who married John Thomlinson in 1758, died the next year, which disrupted the plan for Young to work at Messrs Thomlinson in London, under his sisters in-law.

Young&#x27;s father also died in 1759. In 1761 Young went to London and the following year started a magazine entitled &quot;The Universal Museum&quot;. It ran to five numbers, edited by Young, who recruited William Kenrick, just out of King&#x27;s Bench Prison. It was then sold to a consortium of booksellers, according to initial advice from Samuel Johnson, who wanted no part of it. Young suffered from lung disease from 1761 to 1763, and turned down the offer of a post as a cavalry officer from Sir Charles Howard. Young&#x27;s mother then put him in charge of the family estate at Bradfield Hall, a small property encumbered with debt. Between 1763 and 1766 he concentrated on farming there.

In 1764–1765 Young met and became a friend of Walter Harte, who published his &quot;Essays on Husbandry&quot; in 1764. Harte advised him to give up writing for periodicals. He then collected works by Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, Samuel Hartlib and Jethro Tull, as well as reading Harte. He contributed eleven articles to the &quot;Museum Rusticum&quot; from 1764 to 1765.

==Farmer and writer==
In 1767 Young took over a farm in Essex, at Sampford Hall, one reason being to move away from his mother, who was on bad terms with his wife. For financial reasons he had to move on in 1768 to Bradmore Farm, North Mymms, in Hertfordshire. There he engaged in experiments described in &quot;A Course of Experimental Agriculture&quot; (1770). Though these were generally unsuccessful, they gave him a working knowledge of agriculture. He acted as parliamentary reporter for the London &quot;Morning Post&quot; from 1773.
Young was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1774; but the Society refused a number of his papers on agricultural topics, which always had critics, such as James Anderson of Hermiston. In 1784 Young began the publication of the &quot;Annals of Agriculture&quot;, which ran for 45 volumes: contributors included King George III, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Ralph Robinson&quot;, and Robert Andrews, whom Young took as a model farmer. Young&#x27;s figures for the total area of England and Wales, and total cultivated area, were serious overestimates. In a work from 1799, during wartime and fiscal strain on the national budget, Henry Beeke gave more reliable figures, showing Young had erred.

Young was appointed secretary of the Board of Agriculture in 1793, just after it was formed under the presidency of Sir John Sinclair. In that capacity he worked on collecting and preparing the General View of Agriculture county surveys. The &quot;Annals of Agriculture&quot; began to wind down in 1803, when John Rackham of Bury St Edmunds, who printed it, found copy was lacking and pressed Young, who padded out the pages with old notes. Richard Phillips took it on for volume 41, and saw the publication out, the final volume 45 appearing in 1808.

Economic historians Robert C. Allen and Cormac Ó Gráda have challenged some of Young&#x27;s conclusions.

==Travel writer==
Young began a series of journeys through England and Wales, which he described in books that appeared from 1768 to 1770: &quot;A Six Weeks&#x27; Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales&quot;; &quot;A Six Months&#x27; Tour through the North of England&quot; and the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Tour through the East of England&quot;. He claimed that these contained the only first-hand information on the rentals, produce and stock of England. They were favourably received and widely translated.

He toured the Kingdom of Ireland in 1776–1777, publishing his &quot;Tour in Ireland&quot; in 1780. The book was republished in 1897 and 1925, but with much of Young&#x27;s social detail removed. The full text was republished in 1892 as &quot;Arthur Young&#x27;s Tour in Ireland (1776–1779)&quot; by Arthur Hutton.
Young&#x27;s first visit to France was in 1787. Travelling all over the country annually from 1787 to 1789 (around the start of the French Revolution) he described the condition of the people and the conduct of public affairs at a critical juncture. His &quot;Travels in France&quot; appeared in one large quarto volume in 1792, reprinted in two octavo volumes (Dublin, 1793) and in an enlarged second edition in two quarto volumes (London, 1794).

==On the French Revolution==
An eye-witness to the French Revolution as one who was welcomed into the company of the highest levels of the French nobility (including the King and Queen) at the time of the fall of the Bastille in 1789, Young by 1792 had become an opponent of its violence and modified his reforming views on English politics. Seeing the burned châteaux at Besançon, he was shocked by the provincial disorders, as he had been by the chaotic debates of the National Assembly (for which he recommended John Hatsell&#x27;s book on procedure). He and William Windham aligned themselves with Edmund Burke&#x27;s views expressed in &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), in Young&#x27;s &quot;Plain and Earnest Address to Britons&quot; of November 1792. This was endorsed by the loyalist Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers. In 1793 he opposed Charles Grey&#x27;s reform motion in Parliament and wrote &quot;Example of France a Warning to Britain&quot;.

Still in 1793, Young played a role in recruiting the Suffolk Yeomanry, by pulling together local groups of cavalry volunteers. The formation actually took place in 1794, although a cap-badge date of 1793 was later adopted. He joined with the radical Capel Lofft of Troston Hall in a proposal for a Suffolk ship-of-war to be supported by subscription.

Young returned to the subject of reform in 1798 with &quot;An Enquiry into the State of Mind Amongst the Lowest Classes&quot;. He had attained a formidable position as commentator and used it to call attention to urban unrest and the influence of Tom Paine.

==Associations==
Young&#x27;s closest friend was John Symonds, a Cambridge academic, who became involved in his writing as editor. Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol in 1782 held weekly Thursday dinners at Ickworth for Symonds, Young and others.

In the late 1780s the export of wool became contentious, but Young combined forces with Sir Joseph Banks in opposing restrictions on this. James Oakes of Bury St Edmunds, a yarn dealer, was a friend of both Symonds and Young. In the wool controversy, Oakes was on the other side from Young, who argued that restricting the export of wool was against the interests of landowners, while Oakes wished to see the price of wool to spinners fall.

A tour by Young was typically preceded by newspaper publicity and consisted of social meetings with prominent farmers and agricultural improvers. One in south-west England in 1796 led to an acquaintance with Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet, a judge and improver at Princetown on Dartmoor. Buller corresponded with Young on agricultural matters. The relationship later became awkward, however, when Young&#x27;s son, the Rev. Arthur Young, was suspected of jury tampering in the trial the United Irishman Arthur O&#x27;Connor, on the basis of a letter to Gamaliel Lloyd of Bury St Edmunds, a radical. Buller and the attorney-general took a belligerent attitude to the allegations, when the letter was read out in court.

==Final years==

From 1801, Young followed the evangelical teaching of Thomas Scott at the London Lock Chapel, and was influenced by Charles Simeon. In 1809 he became a correspondent, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. In 1811 he became firm friends with Marianne Francis (1790–1832) a niece of Frances Burney, who shared his commitment to evangelical Christianity. His sight, however, was failing, and in that year he had an operation for a cataract, which proved unsuccessful, leaving him blind.

Young continued to publish pamphlets. He died in Sackville Street, London on 12 April 1820, aged 78, after a painful illness caused by bladder calculus, and was buried at Bradfield Combust church, where his tomb, in sarcophagus form, is inscribed, &quot;Let every real patriot shed a tear, For genius, talent, worth, lie buried here.&quot; The tomb is a designated Grade II listed structure. He left an autobiography in manuscript, which was edited (1898) by Matilda Betham-Edwards.

==Legacy==

Young influenced contemporary observers of economic and social life, such as Frederick Morton Eden and Sir John Sinclair. He was influential too on the American improver John Beale Bordley.

More recently Young has been studied for his methods of investigation. Richard Stone (1997) presents him as a pioneer national income statistician, continuing the work of Gregory King, who had lived a century before. Young produced three estimates of the national income of England: in his &quot;Tour through the North of England&quot;, &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Tour through the East of England&quot; and &quot;Political Arithmetic&quot;. Brunt (2001) emphasises how Young collected his information, and presents him as a pioneer of sample surveys.

==Works==

Young built a reputation on the views he expressed as an agricultural improver, a political economist and a social observer. At the age of 17, he published a pamphlet &quot;On the War in North America&quot;. He also wrote four early novels, and &quot;Reflections on the Present State of Affairs at Home and Abroad&quot; in 1759. In 1768 he published the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Letters to the People of England&quot;, in 1771 the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Calendar&quot;, which went through many editions, and in 1774 his &quot;Political Arithmetic&quot;, which was widely translated.

Young produced around 25 books and pamphlets on agriculture and 15 books on political economy, as well as many articles. These include:

*&quot;A Six Weeks Tour Through the Southern Counties of England and Wales&quot;
*&quot;The Farmer’s Letters to the People of England&quot;, 1768.
*&quot;The farmer&#x27;s guide in hiring and stocking farms.&quot; London, 1770.
* 
*&quot;The Farmer’s Calendar&quot;, 1771; 1862 edition
*&quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Tour Through the East of England: Being the Register of a Journey Through Various ...&quot; 1771
*&quot;Political Arithmetic: Containing Observations on the Present State of Great Britain and the Principles of Her Policy in the Encouragement of Agriculture&quot;, 1774. 
*&quot;A Tour in Ireland&quot;, 1780. Repr. Blackstaff Press, 1983.
*&quot;Annals of Agriculture and other useful Arts.&quot; Vol 1 to 45, 1785-1809; Vol. 1, 1785; Vol. 8, 1787; Vol. 10, 1799; Vol. 17, 1792, Vol. 22, 1794; Vol. 32, 1799; Vol. 45, 1808; 
*&quot;Travels during the years 1787, 1788, &amp; 1789 : undertaken more particularly with a view of ascertaining the cultivation, wealth, resources, and national prosperity of the Kingdom of France&quot;, 1792.
*&quot;View of the agriculture of Oxfordshire. By the secretary of the Board of agriculture and ...&quot; 1809
*&quot;The Autobiography of Arthur Young.&quot; London, 1898.

The &quot;Travels in France&quot; were translated into French in 1793–1794 by François Soules; a new version by Henri Lesage with an introduction by Léonce Guilhaud de Lavergne appeared in 1856. The Directory in 1801 ordered Young&#x27;s writings to be translated in 20 volumes under the title &quot;Le Cultivateur anglais&quot;.

==Family==
In 1765 Young married Martha Allen (died 1815), sister-in-law of Charles Burney. Their acute marital strife and Young&#x27;s devotion to his children were witnessed by Frances Burney and her half-sister Sarah during a visit in 1792. He grieved deeply when his daughter Martha Ann died of consumption on 14 July 1797 at the age of 14, and her loss is said to have turned his mind to religion.

<doc id="224867" wikidata="Q988818" url="?curid=224867" title="Eleanor">
<text>Eleanor () is a feminine given name, originally from an Old French adaptation of the Old Provençal name &quot;Aliénor&quot;. It was the name of a number of women of royalty and nobility in western Europe during the High Middle Ages. The name was introduced to England by Eleanor of Aquitaine, who came to marry King Henry II. It was also borne by Eleanor of Provence, who became queen consort of England as the wife of King Henry III, and Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I.

The name was popular in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s, peaking at rank 25 in 1920. It declined below 600 by the 1970s but has again risen in popularity. It ranked 32nd in the 2010s. It ranked 16th on the popularity chart for names given to newborn girls in the United States in 2022. Eleanor Roosevelt, the longest-serving first lady of the U.S., was probably the most famous bearer of the name in contemporary history. A common variant is Eleonora/Eleanora. In 2022, it was the 43rd most popular name given to girls in Canada.

Common hypocorisms include Elle, Ella, Ellie, Elly, Leonor, Leonora, Leonore, Nella, Nellie, Nelly, and Nora.

==Origin==
The name derives from the Provençal name Aliénor, which became Eléonore in &quot;Langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;, i.e., French, and from there Eleanor in English.

The origin of the name is somewhat unclear; one of the earliest bearers appears to have been Eleanor of Aquitaine (1120s–1204). She was the daughter of Aénor de Châtellerault, and it has been suggested that having been baptized &quot;Aenor&quot; after her mother, she was called &quot;alia Aenor&quot;, i.e. &quot;the other Aenor&quot; or Aliénor in childhood and would have kept that name in adult life. Some sources say that the name Aénor itself may be a Latinization of an unknown Germanic name.

Eleanor of Aquitaine, the most powerful woman in 12th century Europe, was certainly the reason for the name&#x27;s later popularity. However, the name&#x27;s origin with her, and the explanation of &quot;alia Aenor&quot; is uncertain; there are records of possible bearers of the name Alienor earlier in the 12th, or even in the 11th or 10th centuries, but the records of these women post-date Eleanor of Aquitaine, at a time when Alienor had come to be seen as an equivalent variant of the name Aenor (so that presumably, these women during their own lifetime used the given name Aenor):

# Alienor, wife (b. 899) (married 935) of Aimery II, Viscount of Thouars, and mother of Herbert I (born 960).
# Aleanor de Thouars (1050–1088/93), grandmother of Aénor of Châtellerault, and thus Eleanor of Aquitaine&#x27;s great-grandmother. Born c. 1060 as a daughter of Aimery IV of Thouars and Aurengarde de Mauleon. Her name is also cited in some documents as Adenor, Aenors and Aleanor/Alienor, and may have been corrupted to Alienor in genealogies only after the 12th century.
# Eleanor of Normandy, aunt of William the Conqueror, was so named by the 17th-century genealogist Pierre de Guibours, but de Guibours&#x27; sources for this remain unknown.
# Eleanor of Champagne (1102–1147), in 1125 became the first wife of Ralph I, Count of Vermandois, who was displaced by Eleanor of Aquitaine&#x27;s sister Petronilla of Aquitaine, leading to war (1142–44) in Champagne.

<doc id="224872" wikidata="Q790997" url="?curid=224872" title="String Quartet No. 1 (Bartók)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 1 in A minor by Hungarian composer Béla Bartók was completed in 1909. The score is dated January 27 of that year. It is one of six string quartets by Bartok.

The work is in three movements, played without breaks between each:

The work was at least in part inspired by Bartók&#x27;s unrequited love for the violinist Stefi Geyer - in a letter to her, he called the first movement a &quot;funeral dirge&quot; and its opening notes trace a motif which first appeared in his Violin Concerto No. 1, a work dedicated to Geyer and suppressed by Bartók for many years. The intense contrapuntal writing of this movement is often compared to Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet No. 14, Op. 131, the opening movement of which is a slow fugue.

The following two movements are progressively faster, and the mood of the work lightens considerably, ending quite happily. The third movement is generally considered to be the most typical of Bartók&#x27;s mature style, including early evidence of his interest in Hungarian folk music.

The piece was premiered on 19 March 1910 in Budapest by the Waldbauer-Kerpely Quartet, two days after Bartók played the piano with them in a concert dedicated to the music of Zoltán Kodály. It was first published in 1911 in Hungary.

<doc id="224878" wikidata="Q5360904" url="?curid=224878" title="Elijah Craig">
<text>Elijah Craig (November 15, 1738 – May 18, 1808) was an American Baptist preacher, who became an educator and capitalist entrepreneur in the area of Virginia that later became the state of Kentucky. He has sometimes, although rather dubiously, been credited with the invention of bourbon whiskey.

==Early life and education==
Craig was born in Orange County, Virginia in 1738, the 5th child of Polly Hawkins and Taliaferro or Toliver Craig, Sr. Converted by Baptist David Thomas in 1764, Elijah Craig soon began holding meetings in his tobacco barn. In 1766, he convinced David Read to travel from North Carolina to baptize members of the new congregation, including himself. His older brother Lewis and younger brother Joseph Craig also became Baptist preachers. In 1768 Lewis was imprisoned with John Waller, James Childs, James Reed and William Marsh in the Fredericksburg jail for several weeks, for preaching without licenses from the established Anglican Church. In 1771 Elijah Craig was ordained and became the pastor of Blue Run church, halfway between Barboursville and Liberty Mills, Virginia. He was also jailed in Orange and Culpeper counties at least twice for preaching without the required Virginia license from the Anglican Church. Such preachers were considered a challenge to the entire social order of the colony, as the established state church received funding from the colony. In 1774, the convention of independent Baptists designated Elijah Craig and John Waller as apostles (missionaries) to evangelize north of the James River.

Although Virginia had adopted the principle of freedom of religion in its Declaration of Rights in 1776 and again in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786, Baptists still faced persecution during the early statehood period, particularly when they preached to mixed congregations of freemen and slaves, white and black. In these years, Baptists encouraged planters to free their slaves; and numerous slaves were freed in the Upper South during the first two decades after the Revolution. As more Baptists began to accept the institution of slavery, many of those who opposed slavery began to move west, often to the area that would later become Kentucky.

Craig became politically active as the legislative liaison of the general convention and general association to Virginia&#x27;s legislature as well as the ratification convention of 1788. As such, he worked with Patrick Henry and James Madison to protect religious freedom federally and in Virginia after the Revolutionary War. Ultimately, religious freedom became protected in Virginia by statute (and the Anglican Church was disestablished, i.e. lost government financial support), as well as in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Baptist membership grew, particularly among common planters with smaller holdings of land and slaves.

==Migration and settling in Kentucky area of Virginia==
Seeking religious freedom and economic opportunity, in 1781 Elijah&#x27;s brother Rev. Lewis Craig led an exodus of up to 600 people known as &quot;The Travelling Church&quot; (composed of his parents, younger siblings, and most of his congregation from Spotsylvania County) to the area of Virginia known as Kentucky County (they were the largest single group to so migrate). Elijah Craig did not go with this group but followed a few years later.

In 1782 (just after the Revolutionary War), Elijah Craig led the immigration of his congregation from Orange Co., VA, and purchased in what was then Fayette County of Kentucky, where he planned and laid out a town originally called Lebanon, which was incorporated in 1784. (In 1790 the town was renamed Georgetown in honor of Gen. George Washington.) Craig preached at several churches with John Waller.

In 1786 Craig became pastor of the Great Crossing Church, which they had founded the previous year. Joseph Redding succeeded Craig in 1793 after a controversy concerning some of Craig&#x27;s economic activities, and the expulsion of Craig and his party. In 1795 Craig was among the 35 founding members of McConnell&#x27;s Church, near McConnells Run (that later moved and became known as Stamping Ground Baptist Church). Both churches were part of the Elkhorn Association of Baptist churches.

Elijah Craig was active in education, establishing the first classical school in Kentucky in 1787. His advertisement in &quot;The Kentucky Gazette&quot; read:
Education. Notice is hereby given that on Monday, 28 January next, a school will be opened by Messrs. Jones and Worley, at the Royal Spring in Lebanon Town, Fayette County, where a commodious house, sufficient to contain fifty or sixty scholars, will be prepared. They will teach the Latin and Greek languages, together with such branches of the sciences as are usually taught in public seminaries, at twenty five shillings a quarter for each scholar. One half to be paid in cash, the other half in produce at cash prices. There will be a vacation of a month in the spring, and another in the fall, at the close of each of which it is expected that such payments as are due in cash will be made. For diet, washing and house room for a year, each scholar pays £3 in cash, or 500 weight of pork on entrance, and £3 cash on the beginning of the third quarter. It is desired that, as many as can, would furnish themselves with beds; such as cannot may be provided for here, to the number of eight or ten boys, at 35s a year for each bed. ELIJAH CRAIG. LEBANON, December 27, 1787.

The school was later linked to the Rittenhouse Academy, which Craig founded in 1798. Elijah Craig also donated land for Georgetown College, the first Baptist college founded west of the Allegheny Mountains. The college continues today.

Craig became a businessman and local magnate. He built Kentucky&#x27;s first fulling mill (for cloth manufacturing), its first paper mill, its first ropewalk (for manufacturing rope from hemp), and the first lumber and gristmill at Georgetown. Craig played a major role in forming the Georgetown Fire Department and also served as Fire Chief.

==Distillery==
In approximately 1789, Craig founded a distillery. This last enterprise led to his subsequent dubious reputation as the inventor of bourbon whiskey. Craig has sometimes been claimed to have been the first to age the distillation in charred oak casks, &quot;a process that gives the bourbon its brownish color and unique taste&quot;.

Craig built his distillery in what was then Fayette County. The location later became part of Woodford County in 1789, and then Scott County in 1792. It was never in Bourbon County, as some have claimed. As it happened, both Fayette County and Bourbon County were named in honor of the noted Revolutionary War Gen. Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat of the royal House of Bourbon.

American whiskey authority Charles Kendrick Cowdery believes Craig was making exactly the same kind of whiskey as most of his contemporaries, and historian Henry Crowgey calls his reputed invention of bourbon simply a &quot;charming legend&quot;. By 1785, when Bourbon County was formed, dozens (if not hundreds) of small farmer-distillers west of the Alleghenies made corn-based whiskies, which they called &#x27;bourbon&#x27;, to distinguish them from the rye-based whiskies commonly distilled in the East. No historical evidence indicates that Craig&#x27;s whiskey was unique in its time, nor that he practiced charring of the aging barrels. The first known publication potentially alluding to Craig as bourbon&#x27;s inventor was in 1874 (this includes a brief entry in a densely packed list without mentioning Craig himself or providing any documentation of the claim, and without any elaboration as to what distinguished the product as the first bourbon).

==Death==
Craig continued to prosper, eventually owning more than and enough slaves to cultivate it, and operating a retail store in Frankfort. He died in Georgetown in 1808. John Taylor wrote of him in &quot;A History of Ten Baptist Churches&quot;, &quot;His preaching was of the most solemn style; his appearance as of a man who had just come from the dead; of a delicate habit, a thin visage, large eyes and mouth; the sweet melody of his voice, both in preaching and singing, bore all down before it.&quot;

The &quot;Kentucky Gazette&quot; eulogized Craig as follows, &quot;He possessed a mind extremely active and, as his whole property was expended in attempts to carry his plans to execution, he consequently died poor. If virtue consists in being useful to our fellow citizens, perhaps there were few more virtuous men than Mr. Craig.&quot;

==Legacy==

Craig may be most widely known by the bourbon brand Elijah Craig produced by Heaven Hill Distilleries.

Elijah Craig bourbon whiskey was made in both 12-year-old &quot;Small Batch&quot; and 18-year-old &quot;Single Barrel&quot; bottlings. The former 12-year-old expression has lost the age statement. The 18-Year-Old Single Barrel Bourbon is touted by its producer as &quot;The oldest Single Barrel Bourbon in the world at 18 years ...&quot; made in oak barrels that are &quot;hand selected by Parker and Craig Beam&quot;, losing nearly of the barrels&#x27; contents in Angel&#x27;s share.

<doc id="224880" wikidata="Q5456254" url="?curid=224880" title="Five pounds (gold coin)">
<text>The five pound British gold coin, also known as a quintuple sovereign, has a nominal value of five pounds sterling. It has been struck intermittently since 1820, though as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse, Benedetto Pistrucci&#x27;s portrayal of St George and the Dragon, which has traditionally been used on the sovereign, or one-pound gold coin.

The five-pound piece was one of the original denominations of gold coins authorised as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816. It was not struck until 1820, and then only as a pattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction of Una and the Lion by William Wyon. Although the Una coin was for sale for almost half a century at the Royal Mint, only about 400 are believed to have been struck.

In 1887, it was struck for the first time for circulation, and this also took place in 1893 and 1902, though few actually circulated; examples struck in 1911 were only available as part of a proof set. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in very small numbers at the Sydney Mint, with examples bearing its mint mark S. The examples struck in preparation for the coinage of Edward VIII are highly prized; one sold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.

Since 1980, the five-pound gold piece has been struck in most years by the Royal Mint for sale to collectors and holders of bullion. Although generally featuring Pistrucci&#x27;s design, commemorative versions have been issued, such as in 2022, as a memorial following the death of Elizabeth II, featuring the bust of her son and successor, Charles III.

== Origins ==
The five guinea gold coin started out in 1668 as a coin worth one hundred shillings (five pounds), and was sometimes called a five-pound coin. This was before the fluctuating value of the guinea settled at twenty-one shillings in 1717. According to Richard Lobel, in his &quot;Coincraft&#x27;s Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins&quot;, there is some argument that the five-pound piece issued after the Great Recoinage of 1816 was merely a continuation of the earlier coin, which had last been struck in 1753. However, Lobel separates the two series in his catalogue.

After the Napoleonic Wars, Parliament, by the Coinage Act 1816, placed Britain officially on the gold standard, with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea. One reason for the introduction of gold coinage based on the sovereign was that its value, equal to one pound sterling, was more convenient than the guinea, equal to twenty-one shillings. Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.

A committee of the Privy Council recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, two pounds and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by George, Prince Regent on 3August 1816. The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of the old name possibly promoted by antiquarians with numismatic interests. The sovereign and half sovereign were both first issued in 1817, but there was initially no striking of the two larger coins. Since 1754, there had been no issuance of coins more valuable than a guinea intended for general circulation; the need for higher value tender had been met by bank notes. The St George and the dragon design was suggested as an appropriate motif for the sovereign by its creator, Benedetto Pistrucci, based on a cameo he had carved.

== Early issues ==

The first striking of the five-pound denomination after the coinage reform was in 1820 as a pattern coin, depicting George III (). The obverse shows the right-facing bust of the king with the legend (George III by the grace of God king of the Britains, defender of the faith) and the date, while the reverse shows Pistrucci&#x27;s George and dragon design with no legend or date. This design had first appeared on the sovereign in 1817, surrounded by a Garter. The design has Pistrucci&#x27;s surname at the lower left, with the initials of the master of the Mint, William Wellesley-Pole, near the broken spear.

Lobel, in describing the 1820 five-pound piece, noted that on a copy of G. F. Crowther&#x27;s 1887 book, &quot;A Guide to English Pattern Coins&quot; presented to an unknown person with the publisher&#x27;s compliments, there is a pencil notation that work on the 1820 piece was completed a few days before George III&#x27;s death, and after Pistrucci, walking home on the day the king died, heard church bells announcing the demise. He then returned to the Royal Mint and instructed that some five-pound coins be struck the next morning. Lobel described this as a &quot;fascinating episode of numismatic history&quot;. The numismatist Edward Hawkins, writing in 1850, also wrote dramatically, describing what he deemed heroic efforts to ensure that the pattern double sovereigns and five-pound coins were actually struck before the king died, but William John Hocking and others have since studied the matter, concluding the coinage dies were not completed until after the king&#x27;s death on 29 January. The approximately 25 specimens were distributed among Royal Mint officials, prominent numismatists and other important people of the day, as well as given to the Royal Mint and British Museum. One sold in October 2021 for about £635,000.
The next appearance of the denomination was in the reign of George IV (), in 1826, included in the proof set of that year. One piece is known dated 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend (George IV by the grace of God ...) while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend (King of the Britains, defender of the faith). The 1826 coin has the edge inscription (An ornament and a safeguard; seventh year of the reign), while the 1829 coin has a plain edge. No five-pound coins were issued during the reign of William IV ().

==Victoria five-pound coins==

The next coin of this value did not appear until early in the reign of Queen Victoria (), when what Lobel deems one of the most famous and attractive of all British coins was produced. This piece, known as the &quot;Una and the Lion&quot; coin, is described by him as having &quot;cult status&quot;. Una and the Lion appear in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s 16th century epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. The obverse shows the young head of the queen, facing left with the legend (Victoria by the grace of God queen of the Britains, defender of the faith), while the reverse shows her as Una leading the lion to the left, with the legend (May the Lord direct my steps), though some coins say , thus &quot;The Lord directs my steps&quot; – with the date MDCCCXXXIX (1839) in the exergue under the lion. The edge may either have the inscription (an ornament and a safeguard; in the third year of the reign) or be plain. These coins were struck on demand and were sold by the Royal Mint until 1886; there are a number of varieties and a total mintage of perhaps 400. A specimen in exceptional condition sold in 2021 for US$1.44 million (£1.04 million).

Pistrucci&#x27;s George and dragon depiction returned to the five-pound coin in 1887, as part of the Jubilee coinage, with an obverse by Joseph Boehm. The new coin bears the wording (Victoria by the grace of God queen of the Britains, defender of the faith). The abbreviated form of is rendered as rather than with a single &quot;T&quot;: Gladstone, a classical scholar as well as a politician, had pointed out that the abbreviation of a Latin plural noun should end with a doubled consonant.
The 1887 five-pound coin marked the first time that the denomination was available to the public at its face value; previous issues had been pattern or proof coins. In addition to those available for purchase at face value, proof coins were struck as part of the 1887 proof set. The five-pound and two-pound pieces did not circulate to any great extent, and were kept primarily as souvenirs. Nevertheless, the 1887 issue made the five-pound piece the highest-denomination circulating coin in Britain. A few of the 1887 five-pound coins were struck at the Sydney Mint and bear its mint mark S on the reverse. This is an extreme rarity, with only two being known in private hands—one sold in 2021 for US$660,000 (£480,000).

The Pistrucci reverse was used again in 1893, when the obverse used the &quot;Old Head&quot; or &quot;Veiled Head&quot; of the queen, with the legend (Victoria, by the grace of God queen of the Britains, defender of the faith, empress of India), and the edge, like that of the Jubilee issue, is milled. Victoria had been lobbying since 1888 for her title as empress of India, granted by the Royal Titles Act 1876, to be included on the coinage, and on 12 February 1892, the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, wrote to her, &quot;Your Majesty&#x27;s Servants are of opinion that the title of Empress of India, indicating, as it does, Your Majesty&#x27;s relation to far the larger portion of Your subjects, ought to appear on the coin, in the shape of the letters &#x27;Ind Imp&#x27; or &#x27;I.I.&#x27; or some such abbreviation.&quot; , short for or &quot;empress of India&quot;, thus appears on the 1893 issue, which was available both at face value and as part of a proof set.

==Early 20th-century five-pound coins==
Following the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901, preparations began for the coinage of her son and successor, Edward VII (), and a five-pound coin, with an obverse by George William de Saulles, was made current by proclamation dated 1 January 1902. The Royal Mint had decided to make as few changes as possible for King Edward&#x27;s coinage, and the Pistrucci reverse continued for the gold coins. Five-pound coins were issued both at face value and in the proof sets issued to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII. The legend on the obverse reads (Edward VII, by the grace of God king of all the Britains, defender of the faith, emperor of India). The word (short for , meaning &quot;of all&quot;), was added after &quot;&quot; in recognition of the empire&#x27;s assistance during the Boer War, these words last appeared on British coinage in 1953. During Edward&#x27;s reign, five-pound coins were only struck in 1902. A small number of coins, with the mint mark &quot;S&quot;, were struck in 1902 at Sydney, and are extremely rare.

Five-pound coins dated 1911 were struck as part of the coronation proof sets that year for George V (), but for uncertain reasons, no ordinary, non-proof specimens were coined. This was the only issuance of five-pound coins during that reign. These coins featured a bust of King George by Bertram Mackennal, Pistrucci&#x27;s reverse and a legend that was unaltered except to substitute the name of the king, rendered as .
Following the death of King George in 1936, preparations began for the coinage of his son and successor, Edward VIII (). The new king wanted his profile to face left on the new coinage, the same way as his father, which would break a tradition to reverse the direction on the commencement of a new reign which dated back to 1660. Following extensive correspondence between the king and the chancellor of the exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, Edward got his way, and pattern coins bearing a left-facing bust of the king by Thomas Humphrey Paget were struck. The Pistrucci reverse was used, but the king&#x27;s abdication in December 1936 ended the preparations. Edward later requested a set of the pattern coins prepared for him, but was refused by his brother and successor, George VI (). Edward&#x27;s five-pound coin is extremely rare, with only two known to be in private hands, of which one sold in 2021 for US$2,280,000 (£1,654,000), a record for a British coin. The legend on Edward&#x27;s five-pound piece was identical to that of the previous reign but for the name and date; only a similar change was made for George VI, whose five-pound coin features a left-facing bust by Paget and the Pistrucci reverse. This was only struck in 1937, with a plain edge, as part of the coronation proof sets. None were issued for general circulation; but gold had vanished from circulation in Britain twenty years previously.

==Elizabeth II and Charles III==
The reign of Queen Elizabeth II () saw a departure from the normal practice in issuing gold coinage, in which the four denominations of gold coins (the half sovereign, sovereign, double sovereign and five-pound piece) were available to the public in the coronation year. A small number of gold £5 pieces were struck in 1953, the year of Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation, in order to provide continuity of the series, and again in 1957, with an obverse depicting Elizabeth by Mary Gillick and the Pistrucci reverse, but neither of these strikings were released to the public. The 1953 strikings bore an obverse legend of (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all the Britains, defender of the faith) but this was changed for 1957, removing (of all the Britains). This change was made to acknowledge the evolving British Commonwealth, which by then contained some republics. The resulting wording continued to be used on Elizabeth&#x27;s coinage, with variations in the abbreviations. 

No further £5 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation. The Royal Mint realised there was a market for sovereign coins, and began to sell them to collectors at well over face or bullion value. Beginning in 1980, five-pound gold coins were sold every year, except 1983, sometimes in a four-piece proof set with the half sovereign, sovereign and double sovereign, and sometimes sold individually. The pieces sold individually were in uncirculated, rather than proof, condition, and display an encircled U to the left of the date. Pieces up to 1984 used an obverse portrait of Elizabeth by Arnold Machin, and later ones up to 1997 by Raphael Maklouf, excepting the 1989 issue, which featured special designs by Bernard Sindall in honour of the 500th anniversary of the sovereign coin.

From 1998, a new obverse portrait of Elizabeth by Ian Rank-Broadley was used on the five-pound piece. This was used up to 2015. The Pistrucci design continued on the reverse, except in 2002, 2005 and 2012, when commemorative designs were used instead. The special designs for the reverse which were substituted for Pistrucci&#x27;s were for Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002 (by Timothy Noad, depicting a crowned shield within a wreath), in 2005 (a more modern interpretation of the George and dragon, also by Noad) and in 2012 for Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee (another modern interpretation of the George and dragon, by Paul Day). Beginning in 2009, the Pistrucci reverse for the five-pound coin was revised to closely resemble the denomination&#x27;s original 1820 pattern coin, with the designer&#x27;s last name in full to the left of the date, and a broader rim to the coin.

Beginning with some 2015 issues, an obverse portrait of Elizabeth by Jody Clark was used, though in 2016, some coins bore a different portrait of the queen by James Butler. In 2017, a version with the original, 1817 sovereign design was struck. This was for the 200th anniversary of the modern sovereign.
In 2022, the Royal Mint struck five-pound coins with a reverse design by Noad showing an interpretation of the Royal Arms. This design, used for the sovereign and its multiples and fractions, was to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Later in the year, following the death of Elizabeth II, the Royal Mint issued memorial coins in the sovereign range, including the five-pound coin, featuring an interpretation of the Royal Arms by Clark as the reverse, and for the obverse, the first coinage portrait of Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, Charles III (), by Martin Jennings. In addition to a left-facing bust of Charles, the obverse carried the wording (Charles III by the grace of God king, defender of the faith). In 2023, a five-pound piece commemorating the coronation of Charles III was struck, with the obverse a crowned portrait of the king by Jennings and the reverse the Pistrucci George and dragon. For 2024, Jennings&#x27; uncrowned portrait of Charles was paired with Pistrucci&#x27;s reverse on each of the five sovereign denominations struck in proof, from the quarter sovereign to the five-pound piece. For 2025, the five-sovereign piece featured Jean Baptiste Merlen&#x27;s Royal Arms reverse, first used on the sovereign in 1825, for its 200th anniversary.

<doc id="224888" wikidata="Q791001" url="?curid=224888" title="String Quartet No. 3 (Bartók)">
<text>String Quartet No. 3 by Béla Bartók was written in September 1927 in Budapest. It is one of six string quartets by Bartók.

The work is in one continuous stretch with no breaks, but is divided in the score into four parts:

Despite Bartók calling the third section a &quot;recapitulation&quot; it is not a straight repetition of the music from the &quot;prima parte&quot;, being somewhat varied and simplified. Although not marked as such, the coda is in fact a telescoped recapitulation of the &quot;seconda parte&quot;.

The mood of the first part is quite bleak, contrasting with the second part which is livelier and provides evidence of the inspiration Bartók drew from Hungarian folk music, with dance-like melodies to the fore.

The work is even more harmonically adventurous and contrapuntally complex than Bartók&#x27;s previous two string quartets and explores a number of extended instrumental techniques, including &quot;sul ponticello&quot; (playing with the bow as close as possible to the bridge), &quot;col legno&quot; (playing with the wood rather than the hair of the bow), and &quot;glissandi&quot; (sliding from one note to another).

It has often been suggested that Bartók was inspired to write the piece after hearing a performance of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; (1926) in 1927. The piece is the most tightly constructed of Bartók&#x27;s six string quartets, the whole deriving from a relatively small amount of thematic material integrated into a single continuous structure. It is also Bartók&#x27;s shortest quartet, with a typical performance lasting around fifteen minutes.

The work is dedicated to the Musical Society Fund of Philadelphia and was entered into an international competition for chamber music run by the organization. It won the US$6,000 first prize jointly with a work by Alfredo Casella. The piece was premiered on 19 February 1929 by the Waldbauer-Kerpely Quartet in London&#x27;s Wigmore Hall.

The piece was first published in 1929 by Universal Edition.

<doc id="224891" wikidata="Q333426" url="?curid=224891" title="Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax">
<text>Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax (16 April 1881 – 23 December 1959), known as the Lord Irwin from 1925 until 1934 and the Viscount Halifax from 1934 until 1944, was a senior British Conservative politician of the 1930s. He held several senior ministerial posts during this time, most notably those of Viceroy of India from 1926 to 1931 and of Foreign Secretary between 1938 and 1940. He was one of the architects of the policy of appeasement of Adolf Hitler in 1936–1938, working closely with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. After &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; on 9–10 November 1938 and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, he was one of those who pushed for a new policy of attempting to deter further German aggression by promising to go to war to defend Poland.

On Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation early in May 1940, Halifax effectively declined the position of prime minister as he felt that Winston Churchill would be a more suitable war leader (Halifax&#x27;s membership in the House of Lords was given as the official reason). A few weeks later, with the Allies nearing catastrophic defeat and British forces falling back to Dunkirk, Halifax favoured approaching Italy to see if acceptable peace terms could be negotiated. He was overruled by Churchill after a series of stormy meetings of the War cabinet. From 1941 to 1946, he served as British Ambassador to the United States.

== Early life and education ==
Wood was born on 16 April 1881 at Powderham Castle in Devon at the home of his maternal grandfather, William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon. He was born into a Yorkshire family, the sixth child and fourth son of Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax (1839–1934), and Lady Agnes Elizabeth Courtenay (1838–1919). His father was President of the English Church Union, which pushed for ecumenical reunion, in 1868, 1919, and 1927–1934. His great-grandfather was Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, of tea fame, also the prime minister who introduced the Reform Act 1832.

Between 1886 and 1890, Wood&#x27;s three older brothers died young, leaving him, at the age of nine, heir to his father&#x27;s fortune and seat in the House of Lords. He was brought up in a world of religion and hunting. His religiosity as a devout Anglo-Catholic like his father earned him the nickname, possibly coined by Churchill, of the &quot;Holy Fox&quot;. He was born with an atrophied left arm and no left hand, which did not stop him from enjoying riding, hunting and shooting. He had an artificial left hand with a spring-operated thumb, with which he could hold reins or open gates.

Wood&#x27;s childhood was divided mainly between two houses in Yorkshire: Hickleton Hall, near Doncaster, and Garrowby. He attended St David&#x27;s Prep School from September 1892 and Eton College from September 1894. He was not happy at school as he was not talented either at sport or classics. He went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in October 1899. He took no part in student politics but blossomed academically, graduating with a first class degree in Modern History. Whilst at Oxford he was a member of the private all-male dining society the Bullingdon Club, known for its wealthy members, grand banquets, and bad behaviour.

From November 1903 until 1910, he was a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. After a year at All Souls, he went on a Grand Tour of South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand with Ludovic Heathcoat-Amory. In 1905, he returned to England for two years of study at All Souls. He visited Canada in 1907. He wrote a short biography of the Victorian cleric John Keble (1909).

== Early political career and war service ==
Wood had not stood in the 1906 UK general election, at which the Liberals won a landslide victory, choosing to devote his energies to his All Souls Fellowship. By 1909, the political tides had turned enough for Wood to put himself forward for the Conservative candidacy at Ripon in Yorkshire, and he was easily selected through local influence. Ripon had gone Liberal in 1906; Wood won it with a 1,000 vote majority in January 1910 and held it with a reduced majority in December 1910. He remained Member of Parliament for Ripon until his elevation to the Lords in 1925. He was a Ditcher (i.e. opposed to the bitter end and ready to &quot;die in the last ditch&quot; to defend the House of Lords&#x27; right to veto legislation) in the disputes over the Parliament Act 1911 but really made little impact on politics before 1914. He was vigorously opposed to Welsh Disestablishment.

Before the First World War, Wood was already a captain in the Queen&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Dragoons, a West Riding yeomanry regiment. He made a rare intervention in debate, urging that conscription be introduced immediately. He was sent to the front line in 1916. In January 1917 he was mentioned in despatches (&quot;Heaven Knows What For&quot; he wrote). He rose to the rank of major. He was then deputy director of Labour Supply at the Ministry of National Service from November 1917 to the end of 1918. He was initially sympathetic to Lord Lansdowne&#x27;s proposal for a compromise peace, but ultimately demanded all-out victory and a punitive peace.

Wood was unopposed in the UK general elections of 1918, 1922, 1923, and 1924. He was a signatory to the April 1919 Lowther Petition calling for harsher peace terms against Germany in the Treaty of Versailles then being negotiated. In the 1918–1922 Parliament, Wood was an ally of Samuel Hoare, Philip Lloyd-Greame and Walter Elliot, all ambitious younger MPs in favour of progressive reform.

In 1918, Wood and George Lloyd (later Lord Lloyd) wrote &quot;The Great Opportunity&quot;, a tract aiming to set an agenda for a revived Conservative and Unionist Party following the end of the Lloyd George coalition. They urged the Conservative Party to concentrate on the welfare of the community rather than the good of the individual. With the Irish War of Independence then in progress Wood urged a federal solution. At this time he concentrated on housing and agriculture and Ireland.

== Early ministerial career ==
In May 1920, Wood accepted the Governor-Generalship of South Africa; the offer was withdrawn after the South African government announced that it wanted a cabinet minister or a member of the royal family. In April 1921, he was appointed Under-Secretary for the Colonies, under Churchill who was initially reluctant to meet him (on one occasion he stormed into Churchill&#x27;s office and told him that he &quot;expected to be treated like a gentleman&quot;). In the winter of 1921–1922, Wood visited the British West Indies and wrote a report for Churchill.

On 16 October 1922, Wood attended the meeting of the junior ministers who expressed disquiet at the Lloyd George Coalition. On 19 October 1922, he voted at the Carlton Club meeting for the Conservatives to fight the next election as an independent force. The Coalition ended and Bonar Law formed a purely Conservative government. Wood was promoted to the Cabinet on 24 October 1922 as President of the Board of Education. Some saw this as an improvement in the moral character of the government. Austerity policies left no room for constructive policies. Wood, who spent two days hunting each week, was neither interested nor particularly effective in the job but saw it as a stepping stone to greater things. He was not happy about Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s adoption of tariffs in December 1923, which saw the Conservatives lose their majority and give way to a minority Labour government.

When the Conservatives were returned to power on 6 November 1924, Wood was appointed Minister for Agriculture, a more onerous job than Education had been. He took an Agriculture and Tithes Bill through the Commons.

== Viceroy of India ==
In October 1925, Lord Birkenhead, Secretary of State for India, offered Wood the job of Viceroy of India at the suggestion of King George V. His paternal grandfather Sir Charles Wood had been Secretary of State for India in 1859–1865. He almost declined, as he had two sons of school age and his aged father seemed unlikely to live until 1931 when his term was due to end. He accepted on the advice of his father (who lived to see him return). He was created Baron Irwin, of Kirby Underdale in the County of York, in December 1925. He left for India on 17 March 1926, and arrived in Bombay on 1 April 1926. Irwin was honoured with the GCSI and GCIE in 1926.

Irwin relished the pomp of the viceroyalty. He was an able horseman, and stood 6&#x27; 5&quot;. He had a &quot;Cecilian stoop and sympathetic kindly eyes&quot; and gave an impression of a Prince of the Church (R. Bernays &quot;Naked Fakir&quot; 1931). Several attempts were made to assassinate him. He was more sympathetic to Indians than his predecessors had been, although he had no compunctions about signing death warrants when he thought them justified. He wanted Indians to be more united and friendly to the UK; his first major speech as viceroy, and several more throughout his term of office, urged an end to communal violence between Hindus and Muslims.

=== Simon Commission ===
The Government of India Act 1919 had incorporated the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms (&quot;Diarchy&quot; – shared rule between British and Indians at the local level) and had promised that after ten years there would be a commission to inquire about a new constitution and to advise on whether further reforms were needed. Irwin accepted that greater self-government was necessary, as Indian national aspirations had grown since 1919. Birkenhead brought forward the date of the commission, and put it under Sir John Simon. Irwin recommended an all-British inquiry, as he thought that the Indian factions would not agree among themselves but would fall into line behind the results of the inquiry. David Dutton believes that this was &quot;the most fateful mistake of his viceroyalty, and one he came bitterly to regret&quot;.

In November 1927, the composition of the Simon Commission was announced. All the leading Indian parties, including the Indian National Congress, boycotted it. Irwin assured Birkenhead that Simon could win over moderate Indian opinion. Simon arrived in Bombay on 3 February 1928. He achieved some limited successes, but Irwin became convinced that a new gesture would be necessary. Indian responses to Simon&#x27;s arrival included the All-Parties Conference, a committee of which produced the Nehru Report (May 1928), advocating dominion status for India. However, there was also violence, including the death of Lala Lajpat Rai in November 1928 and the revenge attack of Bhagat Singh in December 1928. Other responses included the Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s 14 points (March 1929).

=== Irwin Declaration ===
In June 1929, a new Labour government took office in the UK, with Ramsay MacDonald Prime Minister for the second time and William Wedgwood Benn as Secretary of State for India. On 13 July 1929, Irwin arrived in England on leave, having chosen Lord Goschen to be his acting viceroy in India. Indeed, on his return to London, Irwin brought with him a &quot;suggested&quot; draft exchange of letters between MacDonald and Simon. His plan was for Simon to write proposing a Round Table Conference to discuss the findings of the commission, and that MacDonald would then reply pointing out that the 1917 Montagu Declaration implied a commitment to Dominion status (i.e. that India should become completely self-governing, like Canada or Australia). Simon saw the drafts and had serious misgivings about the planned Round Table Conference. The exchange of letters did not mention Dominion status as the other commissioners did not favour it, although Simon did not report the depth of their feeling, which he came to share, that such a declaration would undermine the findings of the Commission and that Dominion status would now become a minimum demand for the Indian leaders rather than an ultimate goal. The author David Dutton finds it &quot;curious&quot; that Irwin, who had believed that Simon would not object to Dominion status, did not understand this.

The Irwin Declaration of October 1929 committed Britain to eventual Dominion status for India. Despite such a policy having been implicit for a decade, the Declaration was denounced by many on the Tory Right. Lord Reading (Irwin&#x27;s predecessor as Viceroy) denounced it, and Simon made his displeasure known. There was brief hope of a breakthrough in Anglo-Indian relations, but the New Delhi Conference of December 1929 between Irwin and the Indian leaders failed to reach agreement. Gandhi now began a campaign of civil disobedience with a view to achieving complete independence. He walked for 24 days to the sea, where he proceeded to make salt, in breach of the government&#x27;s historic monopoly. Irwin had all the Congress leaders put behind bars, including Gandhi eventually.

Some criticism of Irwin may have been unfair but he had made an error and the consequences were serious and unrest grew. Irwin&#x27;s position was seen as excessively lenient by London but as half-hearted in India. With little room for manoeuvre, Irwin resorted to repression using his emergency powers to ban public gatherings and crush rebellious opposition. Gandhi&#x27;s detention, however, only made matters worse.

=== Agreement with Mahatma Gandhi ===

In November 1930, King George V opened the First Round Table Conference in London; no Congress delegates took part because Gandhi was in jail. In January 1931, Gandhi was released and at Irwin&#x27;s invitation they had eight meetings together. Irwin wrote to his aged father that &quot;it was rather like talking to someone who had stepped off another planet onto this for a short visit of a fortnight and whose mental outlook was quite other to that which was regulating most of the affairs on the planet to which he had descended&quot;. But they had mutual respect based on their respective religious faiths.

The fortnight-long discussions resulted in the Gandhi–Irwin Pact of 5 March 1931, after which the Civil Disobedience Movement and the boycott of British goods were suspended in exchange for a Second Round Table Conference that represented all interests. The salient points were:
* The Congress would discontinue the Civil Disobedience Movement.
* The Congress would participate in the Round Table Conference.
* The Government would withdraw all ordinances issued to curb the Congress.
* The Government would withdraw all prosecutions relating to offences not involving violence.
* The Government would release all persons serving sentences of imprisonment for their activities in the civil disobedience movement.

It was further agreed that Gandhi would join the Second Round Table Conference as the sole representative of the Congress. On 20 March 1931, Irwin paid tribute to Gandhi&#x27;s honesty, sincerity and patriotism at a dinner given by ruling princes. On the evening of 23 March 1931, after a trial now widely viewed to have been unlawful and unfair, the Indian revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar were hanged, in an execution brought forward by 12 hours. The exact extent of political interference is yet to be brought to light.

== British politics 1931–1935 ==
Irwin returned to the UK on 3 May 1931. He was honoured with the Order of the Garter (he became chancellor of the order in 1943). In 1931 he declined the Foreign Office in the new National Government, not least because the Tory Right would not have liked it. Officially, he declared that he wanted to spend time at home. He went to Canada, at the invitation of Vincent Massey, to speak at the University of Toronto. He was still a firm protégé of Stanley Baldwin. In June 1932, on the sudden death of Sir Donald Maclean, he returned to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Education, for the second time, having been apparently genuinely reluctant to accept. His views were somewhat old-fashioned: he declared: &quot;We want a school to train them up to be servants and butlers.&quot;

Irwin became Master of the Middleton Hunt in 1932 and was elected as Chancellor of Oxford University in 1933. In 1934 he inherited the title Viscount Halifax on the death of his 94-year-old father. He helped Samuel Hoare draft what became the Government of India Act 1935, the largest single piece of legislation of the 1931–1935 government. In June 1935, Baldwin became prime minister for the third time, and Halifax was appointed Secretary of State for War. He was pleased to give up the Education job. He felt the country was unprepared for war, but he resisted the Chiefs of Staffs&#x27; demands for rearmament. In November 1935, after the general election, Halifax became Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords.

== Foreign policy ==

===Colleague of Eden===

By this time, Halifax was becoming increasingly influential in foreign affairs. Cabinet met on the morning of 18 December 1935 to discuss the public outcry over the Hoare–Laval Pact. Halifax, who was due to make a statement in the Lords that afternoon, insisted that the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare must resign to save the government&#x27;s position, causing J. H. Thomas, William Ormsby-Gore and Walter Elliott also to come out for his resignation. Anthony Eden was appointed Foreign Secretary in Hoare&#x27;s place. The following year, Halifax said the provisions of the Pact &quot;were not so frightfully different from those put forward by the Committee of Five [of the League]. But the latter were of respectable parentage: and the Paris ones were too much like the off-the-stage arrangements of nineteenth-century diplomacy&quot;. Effectively, although not formally, Halifax was deputy Foreign Secretary to Eden. Halifax was one of the signatories to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. In general they got on well.

Halifax and Eden were in agreement about the direction of foreign policy (and in line with prevailing opinion throughout Britain) that Nazi Germany&#x27;s remilitarization of the Rhineland, its &quot;own backyard&quot;, would be difficult to oppose and should be welcomed insofar as it continued Germany&#x27;s seeming progress towards normality after the tribulations of the post-First World War settlement. In 1936, Neville Chamberlain recorded that Halifax was always saying he wanted to retire from public life. In May 1937, when Neville Chamberlain succeeded Baldwin as prime minister, Halifax became Lord President of the Council, as well as remaining Leader of the House of Lords. Chamberlain began increasingly to intervene directly in foreign policy, activity for which his background had not prepared him, and which caused increasing tension with Eden.

In November 1937, Halifax visited Germany in a semi-official capacity, and met Adolf Hitler. The visit came about after Hermann Göring invited Halifax, in his private capacity as Master of the Middleton Hunt, to attend a hunting exhibition in Berlin, and to hunt foxes with Göring in Pomerania. Halifax later stated that he had initially been unenthusiastic about the circumstances of the visit, although Eden had pressed him to accept the invitation, and Halifax&#x27;s trip to Germany had not been an attempt by Chamberlain to bypass the Foreign Office. In Germany, Göring gave Halifax the nickname &quot;Halalifax&quot; – after a German hunting call, &quot;Halali!&quot;. At Berchtesgaden, there was a long and tense meeting with Hitler, to whom he initially attempted to hand his coat, mistaking him for a footman. In these discussions, Halifax spoke of &quot;possible alterations to the European order which might be destined to come about with the passage of time&quot;. Ignoring Eden&#x27;s reservations, he did not object in principle to Hitler&#x27;s designs on Austria, and parts of Czechoslovakia and Poland, although he stressed that only peaceful processes of change would be acceptable. Halifax was generally regarded publicly at the time as acting on behalf of the British government, and attempting to renew dialogue with the German government.
Writing to Baldwin on the subject of the conversation between Carl Jacob Burckhardt (the League of Nations&#x27; Commissioner of Danzig) and Hitler, Halifax said: &quot;Nationalism and Racialism is a powerful force but I can&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s either unnatural or immoral! I cannot myself doubt that these fellows are genuine haters of Communism, etc.! And I daresay if we were in their position we might feel the same!&quot;

In December 1937, Halifax told the Cabinet that &quot;we ought to get on good terms with Germany&quot;, as despite the best efforts of Eden and Chamberlain, Britain was still faced with the prospect of war with Germany, Italy and Japan. By February 1938, Halifax warned Chamberlain of strains in the Cabinet, and tried to broker a deal between Chamberlain and Eden. Eden resigned as Foreign Secretary on 20 February, in protest at Chamberlain&#x27;s wish to make further concessions to Benito Mussolini, whom Eden regarded as an untrustworthy gangster, without gestures of good faith on his part. Halifax was appointed Foreign Secretary on 21 February 1938, despite some criticism from Labour and elsewhere that so important a job was being given to a peer. Halifax commented &quot;I have had enough for one lifetime&quot; (i.e. as viceroy of India) before accepting appointment as Foreign Secretary. Chamberlain preferred him to the excitable Eden: &quot;I thank God for a steady unruffled Foreign Secretary.&quot;

===Foreign Secretary===

====Analysis====
Halifax&#x27;s political line as Foreign Secretary must be seen in the context of existing British foreign policy, which was predicated on a broad consensus that in none of the democracies was there popular support for war, military pressure, or even rearmament. There was debate about the extent to which the dictatorships&#x27; very separate interests could be teased apart. It was clear that an alignment of Germany and Italy would divide Britain&#x27;s forces in any general war and that, without at least a neutral Italy, Britain would be unable to move large naval forces east to confront Japan, given strong isolationist sentiment in America. For many, especially in the Foreign Office, appeasement was a necessary compromise to buy time for rearmament, a process to which Britain was already heavily committed. Others, especially Churchill, hoped that a strong military alliance with France would permit a more robust foreign policy towards the dictators. Many shared Churchill&#x27;s confidence in the large French Army, although fewer shared his belief that France would be a resilient ally.

Chamberlain embraced the policy of appeasement as a moral force for good, as did many others who were deeply opposed to war and defence spending. By comparison, Halifax&#x27;s policy appears more pragmatic, like that of Samuel Hoare, coupled to a firm commitment to rearmament, albeit unenthusiastically. All parties recognised the hostility of public opinion to war or military preparations, and the difficulty of acting without a readiness on the part of America or the Soviet Union to play their part (the Labour Party opposed rearmament until well after the Munich Agreement). Nonetheless, Halifax was criticised as an appeaser, along with Chamberlain, Hoare, and twelve others, in the anonymous 1940 book &quot;Guilty Men&quot;.

====Munich====

Hitler&#x27;s annexation of Austria in March 1938 made Halifax keener on British rearmament. Czechoslovakia was clearly next on the agenda, but neither Britain nor France believed they had the military capacity to support her, and in the summer of 1938, Halifax still wanted to urge the Czechoslovaks in private to make concessions to Germany, which was making demands regarding the status of the Sudeten Germans. Halifax remained in London and did not accompany Chamberlain on his dramatic flights to Germany in the autumn of 1938. This was once seen as a sign of Chamberlain&#x27;s dominance of his Cabinet.

It appears that a frank conversation with his pugnacious Permanent Secretary, Sir Alexander Cadogan, brought Halifax to the sharp realisation that the road to appeasement had taken Britain into a series of concessions that were unwise and that were unlikely to secure the necessary pacification of Germany. On 25 September 1938, Halifax spoke out in Cabinet against the inflated demands presented by Hitler in the Godesberg Memorandum after his second summit meeting with Chamberlain. It is now known that Halifax, under Cadogan&#x27;s influence, persuaded the Cabinet to reject the Godesberg terms. Britain and Germany came close to war until Chamberlain flew to Munich. Chamberlain could hardly afford to lose a second Foreign Secretary, and his dominance of his Cabinet was never so overwhelming again.

The eventual Munich Agreement, signed after Chamberlain&#x27;s third summit meeting with Hitler, was apparently popular around the world and humiliating to many in the British government, but it was short of Hitler&#x27;s desires (and of Chamberlain&#x27;s proposed concessions) and increased Hitler&#x27;s determination to return to destroy Czechoslovakia in the spring. On 3 October 1938, Halifax defended the Munich Agreement in the House of Lords, in much more measured terms than the Prime Minister had done, not as a triumph but as the lesser of two evils.

The Munich crisis had seen Halifax begin to take a stronger line than Chamberlain against further concessions to Germany. Andrew Roberts argues that from this point on, Halifax set his face firmly towards a policy of deterrence. He hoped that increased rearmament—including strengthening of alliances with and economic support to the countries of Eastern Europe, and the reintroduction of conscription—coupled with a firmer line towards Germany, Italy, and Japan would reduce the risks of those three hostile powers acting in combination. It is of note that, when war began, neither Japan nor Italy was prepared to join in until the pendulum had swung much further in Germany&#x27;s favour.

====After Munich====

After Munich, Halifax (successfully) advised Chamberlain against capitalising on his popularity by calling a snap general election; instead, he urged (in vain) for Chamberlain to widen the National Coalition by offering jobs not just to Churchill and Eden but also to Labour and Liberal figures. Halifax was also disgusted by the anti-Jewish pogrom of Kristallnacht (10 November). He advocated British financial aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to discourage them from coming under Germany&#x27;s influence. With Hitler&#x27;s lack of commitment regarding the Munich Agreement becoming clearer, Halifax worked steadily to assemble a stronger British position by pushing Chamberlain to take economic steps to underpin British interests in Eastern Europe and prevent additional military supplies from reaching Germany, such as tungsten. In January 1939, Halifax accompanied Chamberlain to Rome for talks with Mussolini. That month Halifax pushed for staff talks with France, in view of the danger of war with both Germany and Italy simultaneously. After Hitler broke the Munich agreement and occupied the rump of &quot;Czecho-slovakia&quot; (the hyphen had been added after Munich), Chamberlain gave a speech in Birmingham on 17 March 1939, pledging that Britain would go to war to defend Poland. Halifax had been one of the drivers in this change of policy. By March 1939, Eden, then out of office, observed that thanks to Halifax the government are &quot;now doing what we would wish&quot;.

Halifax granted a guarantee to Poland on 31 March 1939, triggered by alarming intelligence of German preparations, in hopes of sending clear signals to Germany that, in Halifax&#x27;s words, there would be &quot;no more Munichs&quot;. The Foreign Office received intelligence in early April 1939 that Italy was about to invade Albania. At a Cabinet meeting on 5 April 1939, Halifax rejected these reports. Two days later, Italy invaded Albania; Halifax met Sir Alexander Cadogan and &quot;decided we can&#x27;t &quot;do&quot; anything to stop it&quot;. Although he disliked the Soviet regime, not least because of its atheism, Halifax was quicker than Chamberlain to realise that Britain should attempt to ally with the Soviets. He told the Foreign Affairs committee: &quot;Soviet Russia is something between that of the unconquerable steamroller and looking on her as entirely useless militarily. We cannot ignore a country with a population of 180,000,000 people.&quot;

The negotiations (in summer 1939) failed, and the Soviets signed an agreement with the Germans instead on 23 August. It has been suggested that Halifax should have led the negotiations himself, but that would not have suited Halifax&#x27;s purpose because his government had not carried out the negotiations in good faith. The Foreign Office confirmed to the US chargé d&#x27;affaires on 8 August 1939 that &quot;the military mission, which had now left Moscow, had been told to make every effort to prolong discussions until 1 October 1939&quot;. Halifax disclosed to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 10 July 1939: &quot;Although the French were in favour of the military conversations commencing, the French Government thought that the military conversations would be spun out over a long time and as long as they were taking place we should be preventing Soviet Russia from entering the German camp.&quot;

While Henry Roberts has spoken of Halifax&#x27;s fellow Foreign Minister (of the Soviet Union), Maxim Litvinov, as having acute perceptive skills and an ability &quot;to detect major trends in the 1930s and to anticipate the course of events indicates his tremendous understanding of the decade&quot;, Halifax had completely misunderstood Hitler. Halifax said: &quot;Hitler had a very low opinion of the Soviet Union, and our action [in aligning with the Soviets] would confirm to him the idea that we were a weak and feeble folk&quot;. On the contrary, what made Hitler worried was the thought of a joint pact between France, Britain and the Soviet Union to prevent a pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. Halifax did not know that in April 1939, Hitler told Ernst von Weizsäcker that he was contemplating a reconciliation with the Soviet Union. On 2 August 1939, Hitler asked Konstantin von Neurath, a former Foreign Minister and career diplomat during the Weimar Republic, whether the German people would accept such an ideological shift from anti-communism to signing a pact with the Soviet Union. Neurath assured Hitler that he &quot;could do what he liked with the [National Socialist] Party&quot;.

With Poland now looking likely to be carved up between Germany and the Soviets (as indeed soon took place), the diarist &quot;Chips&quot; Channon, Parliamentary Private Secretary to Halifax&#x27;s junior minister Rab Butler, who opposed the guarantee, recorded (25 August 1939) that &quot;the barometer of war kept shifting&quot; and that &quot;the Polish guarantee was [Halifax]&#x27;s pet scheme and favourite god-child&quot;. When Germany invaded Poland, Halifax refused any negotiations while German troops remained on Polish soil. However, he stood solid with Chamberlain, who delayed in giving a commitment to go to war until the French had also committed. Both of them were the objects of a Cabinet revolt, which insisted on Britain honouring the guarantee to Poland. Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939.

===Phoney War===
After the outbreak of war, Halifax&#x27;s diplomacy aimed to dissuade the Soviets from formally joining the Axis powers. He opposed the bombing of Germany, lest the Germans retaliate. Swedish intermediary Birger Dahlerus had approached Britain for peace talks in August 1939, just before the outbreak of war. On 1 November 1939, Halifax replied to an approach through Swedish channels that no peace was possible with Hitler in power. Even that aroused the wrath of Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, who sent a private note to Halifax rebuking him that such talk was dangerous. Halifax remained opposed to any hint of a compromise peace during the Phoney War.

===Churchill as Prime Minister===
On 8 May 1940, Chamberlain&#x27;s government survived a motion of no confidence brought about by the deteriorating military situation in Norway. The government had a nominal majority of 213 in the House: at the end of the &quot;Norway Debate&quot;, they won the vote with a majority of only 81; 33 Conservatives and 8 of their allies voted with the opposition parties, and 60 abstained. Churchill had only grudgingly been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Nevertheless, he mounted a strong and passionate defence of Chamberlain and his government in the debate preceding the vote. Under ordinary circumstances, such a weak vote would not have been politically disastrous, but it was decisive at a time when the Prime Minister was being strongly criticised by both sides of the House and there was a strong desire for national unity. Talking to Churchill after the vote, Chamberlain admitted his dismay and said that he would try for a coalition government with the Labour and Liberal parties, but Churchill opposed that.

At 10.15am the next morning (9 May), Chamberlain met with Halifax and Churchill in the Cabinet Room. Churchill&#x27;s own account of these events, published eight years later in &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;, the first volume of his &quot;The Second World War&quot;, does not tally exactly with contemporary accounts such as Halifax&#x27;s own diary and Alexander Cadogan&#x27;s record of his conversations with Halifax, or accounts given by Chamberlain or by the Chief Whip David Margesson (whose presence at the meeting Churchill does not mention). Churchill described a battle of wills in which Chamberlain opened the meeting by arguing that Churchill could not command the support of the Labour Party after he had had to defend the government at the Norway Debate, only to be met with a lengthy silence before Halifax, with some hesitation, expressed his own unfitness for the job. Other accounts describe Halifax demurring much more rapidly, and Churchill actively agreeing with him. Churchill also misdates the events of 9 May to the following day, and although his writing assistant William Deakin accepted responsibility for this error he later confirmed, in an interview in 1989, that Churchill&#x27;s account was embellished after numerous retellings and was not meant to be taken seriously. The description of Chamberlain attempting to persuade Churchill to agree tacitly to Halifax&#x27;s appointment as prime minister is also hard to reconcile with Halifax&#x27;s having expressed his reluctance to do so to Chamberlain at a meeting between the two men on the morning of the 9th.

At 4.30pm that afternoon Chamberlain held another meeting, attended by Halifax, Churchill, and the leader and the deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party (Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood respectively). He asked the Labour leaders if they would agree to serve in a coalition government. They replied that it might be possible but only with a different prime minister and that before they could give an official answer, they would need the approval of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee, then in Bournemouth preparing for the annual conference which was to start on the Monday. They were asked to telephone with the result of the consultation by the following afternoon. In his diary entry for 9 May, written up the following morning, Halifax later wrote:
The Labour leaders telephoned at 5pm on the 10th to report that the party would take part in a coalition government, although it had to be under the leadership of someone other than Chamberlain. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation, recommending that George VI ask Churchill to form a government. On doing so, one of Churchill&#x27;s first actions was to form a new, smaller War cabinet by replacing six of the Conservative politicians with Greenwood and Attlee, retaining only Halifax and Chamberlain.

Churchill&#x27;s political position was weak, although he was popular with the Labour and Liberal parties for his stance against appeasement in the 1930s. He was unpopular in the Conservative Party, however, and he might not have been the choice of the King. Halifax had the support of most of the Conservative Party and of the King and was acceptable to the Labour Party. His position as a peer was a merely technical barrier given the scale of the crisis, and Churchill reportedly was willing to serve under Halifax. As Lord Beaverbrook said, &quot;Chamberlain wanted Halifax. Labour wanted Halifax. Sinclair wanted Halifax. The Lords wanted Halifax. The King wanted Halifax. And Halifax wanted Halifax.&quot; Only the last sentence was incorrect, however; Halifax did not want to become prime minister. He believed that Churchill&#x27;s energy and leadership skills were superior to his own.

Unlike Simon, Hoare and Chamberlain, Halifax was not the object of Labour hatred in May 1940. Dutton argues that he &quot;drew back&quot; because of &quot;inner self-doubt&quot;. &quot;Political ambition had never been the most compelling motivation&quot;. He had a stomach ache, possibly psychosomatic, at the thought of becoming prime minister, and also probably thought that he could wield more influence as Churchill&#x27;s deputy. Like Chamberlain, he served in Churchill&#x27;s cabinet but was frequently exasperated by Churchill&#x27;s style of doing business. Like many others, Halifax had serious doubts about Churchill&#x27;s judgement.

===May 1940 war cabinet crisis===

Germany invaded Belgium, the Netherlands, and France on 10 May 1940, the day that Churchill became prime minister. On 22–23 May, the German army reached the English Channel, isolating the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk. Churchill soon had a confrontation with Halifax who believed that the United Kingdom should try to negotiate a peace settlement with Hitler, using Mussolini as an intermediary. Halifax believed it better to try to get terms &quot;safeguarding the independence of our Empire, and if possible that of France&quot;, in the belief that peace talks would make it easier to get the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) home. He did not believe that there was any realistic chance of defeating Germany. Churchill disagreed, believing that &quot;nations which went down fighting rose again, but those which surrendered tamely were finished&quot; and that Hitler was unlikely to honour any agreement. Moreover, he believed that this was the view of the British people.

On 24 May, Hitler ordered his armies to halt before they reached Dunkirk, and two days later, the British and French navies began to evacuate the Allied forces. Between 25 and 28 May, Churchill and Halifax each fought to bring the War Cabinet around to their own respective points of view; by 28 May, it seemed as if Halifax had the upper hand and that Churchill might be forced from office. Halifax came close to resignation, which might have brought down Churchill&#x27;s government. Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax by calling a meeting of his 25-member Outer Cabinet, to whom he delivered a passionate speech, saying, &quot;If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground&quot;, convincing all who were present that Britain must fight on against Hitler whatever the cost. Churchill also obtained the backing of Neville Chamberlain, who was still Conservative Party leader.

Churchill told the War Cabinet that there would be no negotiated peace. Halifax had lost. A few weeks later, in July 1940, Halifax rejected German peace offers presented through the Papal Nuncio in Berne and the Portuguese and Finnish prime ministers. Halifax wrote in his memoirs of an occasion during a short holiday in Yorkshire:

== Ambassador to the United States ==
When Chamberlain retired from the Cabinet due to ill health, Churchill tried to ease Halifax out of the Foreign Office by offering him a job as &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister, living at 11 Downing Street. Halifax refused, although he agreed to become Leader of the Lords once again. In December 1940, the Marquess of Lothian, British Ambassador to the United States, died suddenly. Halifax was told to take the job by Churchill, with the proviso that he could still attend meetings of the War Cabinet when he was home on leave in London. Churchill&#x27;s secretary Jock Colville recorded on 20 December that Churchill thought the Washington job was a great opportunity for Halifax to help bring the United States into the war. Colville recorded Churchill&#x27;s view that Halifax &quot;would never live down the reputation for appeasement which he and the F.O. had won themselves here. He had no future in this country.&quot; Colville thought Churchill had been influenced by the monthly censorship reports, which showed that Halifax had inherited some of Chamberlain&#x27;s unpopularity. Halifax was the last man linked with appeasement to leave the Cabinet, as Chamberlain had by then died, and both Hoare and Simon had already moved to other jobs. Halifax and his wife desperately tried to persuade Eden to take the Washington job instead, but to no avail. Eden was restored to the Foreign Office in Halifax&#x27;s place.

Halifax set sail for the still neutral United States in January 1941. President Franklin D. Roosevelt welcomed him in person when he arrived. Casting aside diplomatic protocols, Roosevelt took the presidential yacht the &quot;Potomac&quot; to greet Halifax as his ship made harbour in the Chesapeake Bay. Initially Halifax damaged himself by a series of public relations disasters. Two weeks after his arrival in the United States, Halifax went to Capitol Hill, meeting with House and Senate leaders. Upon leaving, Halifax told reporters that he had inquired about the timetable for passage of the Lend-Lease Act. Isolationists seized upon the meetings to decry British meddling in American political affairs. He likened Washington politics to &quot;a disorderly day&#x27;s rabbit shooting&quot;.

Halifax was initially a cautious and elusive public figure, not an effective public diplomat like his predecessor. His relations with Roosevelt were satisfactory, but Halifax kept a low profile. Churchill&#x27;s close engagement with the United States and his investment in personal communication with the President meant a more constrained role for the British Ambassador. Communications technology meant that Churchill could communicate directly with Roosevelt from London; the Prime Minister was also a regular visitor to Washington, enabled by more advanced transportation technology (including both faster ships and aeroplanes). Halifax&#x27;s cousin Angus McDonnell helped him find his feet, and he soon led a very effective propaganda effort. Even an incident that autumn where he was pelted with rotten eggs and tomatoes by isolationists helped his reputation in the long run. He maintained good relations with Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins, and toured the country, meeting many more ordinary Americans than his predecessor had done. He became especially popular after Pearl Harbor.

Relations also increasingly turned on military issues channelled through the Joint Chiefs of Staff secretariat in Washington. Halifax wearied of Washington, especially after the death in action of his middle son Peter in November 1942, and the serious wounding of his younger son Richard in January 1943. In March 1943 he vainly asked Anthony Eden to be relieved of his post, but had to stay. In May 1944, Wood was created Earl of Halifax, the fourth creation of the title. Halifax took part in a plethora of international conferences over the UN and the Soviet Union. With Labour in power under Clement Attlee from July 1945, Halifax agreed to Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin&#x27;s request to stay on until May 1946. In February 1946, he was present at Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech at Fulton, Missouri, of which he did not entirely approve. He believed that Churchill&#x27;s view of the Soviet threat was exaggerated and urged him to be more conciliatory. He also helped John Maynard Keynes negotiate the Anglo-American loan, which was finalised in July 1946.

The final year of his Ambassadorship also witnessed the transition to President Harry S. Truman. Those years contained fraught moments and challenges for the relationship, as American power eclipsed that of Britain, and Britain&#x27;s interests and rights were ignored on occasion, in particular, the cessation of nuclear co-operation after construction of the atom bomb. However, the partnership in World War II was immensely successful and as close as any other such partnership. It was a demanding post by any standards, but Halifax could reasonably claim to have played his part, and he enjoyed a notably longer term than his less successful successor Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel.

== Later life ==
Back in the United Kingdom, Halifax refused to rejoin the Conservative front bench, arguing that it would be inappropriate as he had been working for the Labour Government then still in office. The Labour Government were proposing that India become fully independent by May 1948 (later brought forward to August 1947) with no plans in place to protect minorities. Viscount Templewood (as Samuel Hoare was now known) opposed the plan, but Halifax spoke in the government&#x27;s favour, arguing that it was not appropriate to oppose the plan if no alternative was suggested. He persuaded many wavering peers to support the government.

In retirement, Halifax returned to largely honorary pursuits. He was Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. He was an active governor of Eton and Chancellor of Oxford University. He was an honorary Fellow of All Souls from 1934. He was Chancellor of the University of Sheffield and High Steward of Westminster Abbey. He was Master of the Middleton Hunt. He was President of the Pilgrims Society, a society dedicated to better Anglo-American relations. From 1947 he was chairman of the General Advisory Council of the BBC. From 1957 he was Grand Master of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

By the mid-1950s, his health was failing. One of his last major speeches in the House of Lords was in November 1956, when he criticised the government&#x27;s Suez policy and the damage it was doing to Anglo-American relations. He did little to challenge the critical view of appeasement which was then fashionable. His 1957 autobiography &quot;Fulness of Days&quot; was described in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; as &quot;gently evasive&quot;. David Dutton describes it as &quot;an extremely reticent book which added little to the historical record&quot;. He gave the impression that he had been Chamberlain&#x27;s faithful subordinate, omitting to mention his role in changing policy in spring 1939.

He died of a heart attack at his estate at Garrowby on 23 December 1959, aged 78. His widow survived him until 1976.

Halifax had sold Temple Newsam to the City of Leeds for less than market value in 1925, although a similar offer for its contents was declined by the council. In 1948 he donated 164 of his paintings to a museum being opened there by Leeds City Council. His will was valued for probate at £338,800 10s 8d (not including settled land – land tied up in family trusts so that no individual has full control over it), equivalent to around £7m at 2016 prices. Despite his great wealth, Halifax was notoriously mean with money. Rab Butler recounted a tale of how he had once been having a meeting with Halifax, his boss at the time. An official brought in two cups of tea and four biscuits for them; Halifax passed two of the biscuits back, instructing the official not to charge him for them.

== Assessments ==
Halifax could not pronounce his &quot;r&quot;s. He had professional charm and the natural authority of an aristocrat, the latter aided by his immense height. He stood . Harold Begbie described Halifax as &quot;the highest kind of Englishman now in politics&quot; whose &quot;life and doctrine were in complete harmony with a very lofty moral principle, but who has no harsh judgement for men who err and go astray.&quot; Harold Macmillan said that Halifax possessed a &quot;sweet and Christian nature.&quot; Rab Butler called him &quot;this strange and imposing figure—half unworldly saint, half cunning politician.&quot;

In 1968, the official records were released of Halifax&#x27;s years as Foreign Secretary (the &quot;fifty-year rule&quot; was replaced by the &quot;thirty-year rule&quot;). Conservative historian Maurice Cowling argued that Halifax&#x27;s stance of increasing resistance to Hitler, especially the Polish guarantee in the spring of 1939, was motivated not so much by considerations of strategy but by a need to keep ahead of a sea-change in British domestic opinion. He wrote in 1975: &quot;To history, until yesterday, Halifax was the arch-appeaser. This, it is now recognised, was a mistake. His role, however, was complicated. In these pages he is not the man who stopped the rot, but the embodiment of Conservative wisdom who decided that Hitler must be obstructed because Labour could not otherwise be resisted.&quot;

David Dutton argues that Halifax, like Chamberlain, was slow to appreciate the sheer evil of Hitler and was overly confident that negotiation could yield results. His period as Foreign Secretary was &quot;the pivot of his career and it remains the period upon which his historical reputation ultimately depends&quot;; just as Eden saved his reputation by resigning in time, so Halifax damaged his by being Foreign Secretary in 1938–40. &quot;He deserves some credit for abandoning, or at least for decisively modifying, the policy of appeasement&quot;. His refusal to seize the premiership in May 1940 was &quot;the most significant act of his long career&quot;. He argues that later that month, far from being a potential Quisling, Halifax based his policies on rational considerations, and that &quot;on rational grounds, there had been much to be said for the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s line that Britain should at least have investigated what peace terms were on offer.&quot; However, his &quot;most important role in public life&quot; was, in Dutton&#x27;s view, as Ambassador to the United States, where he helped to smooth a relationship which was &quot;often more fraught than early interpretations ... tended to suggest&quot;.

Halifax College at the University of York is named after him. Lady Irwin College, a women&#x27;s college in Delhi, was established under the patronage of Dorothy, Lady Irwin, in 1931.

<text>Major League Baseball (MLB) does not have a hard salary cap, instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season. Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries.

Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $856,850 ($ inflation-adjusted from 1934 dollars) over his entire playing career. When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($ inflation-adjusted), while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, &quot;What the hell has Hoover got to do with it? Besides, I had a better year than he did.&quot;

Pitcher Nolan Ryan was the first player to earn an annual salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the Houston Astros in 1979. Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989. In 1990, Jose Canseco signed for 5 years and $23.5 million, making him the first player to earn an average of $4 million a year. It wasn&#x27;t until 2010 when the MLB average salary rose above that same mark.

Alex Rodriguez signed two record-breaking contracts over the course of his career. First, he signed a $252 million, 10-year contract with the Texas Rangers in December 2000 ($ inflation-adjusted from 2000 dollars). Sandy Alderson called the deal &quot;stupefying&quot;, while &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted that Rodriguez&#x27;s early salaries under the contract ($21 million) would be greater than the annual payroll of the entire Minnesota Twins team that year ($15.8 million). The deal was the largest sports contract in history, doubling the total value of Kevin Garnett&#x27;s $126 million National Basketball Association contract (the previous record holder) and more than doubling Mike Hampton&#x27;s $121 million contract, the previous MLB record which had been signed just days before. The Rangers later traded Rodriguez to the Yankees in exchange for Alfonso Soriano before the 2004 season, though they agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million outstanding on the contract. Despite this, he opted out of the remainder of his deal after the 2007 season and renegotiated a new $275 million, 10-year agreement with the Yankees, breaking his own record for the largest sports contract. Under this deal, Rodriguez also received $6 million when he tied the career home run total of Willie Mays (660), and would have received $6 million more had he tied Babe Ruth (714), Hank Aaron (755), and Barry Bonds (762), along with another $6 million for breaking Bonds&#x27; mark.

Five of the twenty highest-paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB. From 2003 to 2020, the Yankees&#x27; payroll exceeded the luxury tax threshold every year except 2018.

==Footnotes==
* &quot;Earnings&quot; as discussed here refers to salaries paid to players under MLB contracts and does not include advertising or other sources of income. All values are listed in nominal dollars.
* &quot;Average annual value&quot; is calculated as the total value of a contract (less bonuses) divided by the number of years. A $20 million/2-year contract would have an average annual value of $10 million, even if the player actually received $9 million one season and $11 million in the other. This also does not include contracts for less than a season prorated in value for a full season such as Roger Clemens&#x27; 2006 and 2007 contracts. All values are listed in nominal dollars.
* Dave Winfield initially negotiated a 10-year deal in 1980 worth a projected $25 million ($2.5 million per year). However, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner reportedly had not fully understood a cost of living adjustment provision in it and the 10-year contract was renegotiated a few months later. The final precise value is unclear, although it fell between $20 and $25 million in total value ($2–2.5 million a year).
* Hershiser and Frank Viola both won the 1988 Cy Young Award and Viola signed an identically sized $7.9 million, 3-year contract two months after Hershiser.
* Rickey Henderson signed a $12 million, 4-year contract with the Oakland Athletics on November 28, 1989, 6 days after Puckett signed his $9 million, 3-year contract.
* Roger Clemens signed a contract extension during the 2000 season covering 2001 and 2002 along with a player option for 2003. Clemens was paid $10.3 million each year for 2001 and 2002, with the same $10.3 million available if he elected to play in 2003 under his option. However, Clemens also received $10.3 million if he rejected the option. As a result, he could effectively collect the full $30.9 million of contract value for only two years of play ($15.45 million annually). However, the Yankees valued this deal as a $10.3 million annually, three-year deal. He became a free agent after the 2002 season and ultimately re-signed with the Yankees for a new, one-year contract in which they bought out the previous option.
* Shohei Ohtani signed a $700 million 10-year contract with the Dodgers. Ohtani will receive $2 million a year for ten years and then $68 million a year for the following ten years. Because of this, the present value AAV is lower than the $70 million he&#x27;d otherwise earn if there were no deferrals.

<text>A skyrocket, also known as a rocket, is a type of firework that uses a solid-fuel rocket to rise quickly into the sky; a bottle rocket is a small skyrocket. At the apex of its ascent, it is usual for a variety of effects (stars, bangs, crackles, etc.) to be emitted. Skyrockets use various stabilisation techniques to ensure the flight follows a predictable course, often a long stick attached to the side of the motor, but also including spin-stabilisation or fins.

These rockets have been made at least since the early decades of the 20th century, and in many countries, including Japan and China. The older type of bottle rocket was typically a black powder skyrocket with an engine about 2 inches (5 cm) long and up to 0.375-inch (9-mm) diameter, mounted on a thin bamboo splint and often having a small report charge. Modern bottle rockets are small and very cheap. They are often sold by the box (but more commonly by the pack, or by the gross, a packet of 144 rockets) for less than US$0.20 each.

==Construction==
A bottle rocket consists of three major parts including:
*The rocket engine will typically use a black powder-type fuel, possibly with additives that produce a decorative spark trail as the rocket ascends, but other chemical reactions have also been used for thrust. The fuel is pressed to form a solid grain inside a cardboard tube, which is sealed at the top but open at the bottom with an air gap. When the fuel is ignited from the bottom, hot gases expand in the air gap and are expelled downward to propel the rocket upward. Other fuels are possible; a common alternative is whistle mix, to produce a whistling rocket.
*The nose cone, in addition to serving an aerodynamic role, typically contains the rocket&#x27;s payload. This may include exploding fireworks, colored stars, a parachute, confetti, or other decorative items.
*The guide stick, in a bottle rocket lacking fins or other stabilizers, provides stability in flight. The stick&#x27;s length and weight are sized to achieve this.

==Professional displays==
A common misconception about professional fireworks displays is that skyrockets are used to propel the pyrotechnic effects into the air. In reality, skyrockets are more widely used as a consumer item. Professional fireworks displays utilize mortars to fire aerial shells into the air, not rockets.

==Sale and regulation==
Bottle rockets are specifically illegal in many jurisdictions, even those where most other consumer fireworks are legal. They are sometimes considered to present a unique hazard, due to their ability to fly in many directions other than vertically.

===Canada===
Bottle rockets are banned under the &quot;Explosives Act&quot;, thus making importation, possession, transportation, storage or manufacturing illegal in Canada.

===India===
In India, bottle rockets are set off during the Hindu festival of Diwali, and are sold in the millions.

===Norway===

Skyrockets were officially banned in Norway starting from the new years eve of 2008/09. Skyrockets are strictly forbidden, and carry heavy fines for anyone who are caught launching them.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Republic Act 7183 was enacted to regulate and to control the sale, distribution, manufacture and use of fireworks and firecrackers for public safety. According to the said law, skyrockets (known in the Philippines as &quot;kwitis&quot;) are legal and are designed to propel from before exploding. Despite being legal, it poses danger to those using it. In 2012, it was recorded that skyrockets were the second most harmful firecracker after piccolo.

===Thailand===
In Thailand&#x27;s Isan region, many are made by hand and sold in conjunction with Rocket Festivals. The largest bottle rockets used at the festivals are &quot;Bang Fai&quot; rockets which can be up to 20 metres long and charged with up to 500 kg of black powder.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom firework rockets are sold by weight, e.g.: , , 1 lb. This is not the weight of the rocket itself, but rather of a lead sphere whose diameter matches that of the rocket motor. Rocket weight in the UK is officially defined as &quot;the weight of a lead sphere that is &quot;just&quot; supported by a tube that the rocket motor will &quot;just&quot; fit into.&quot;

<doc id="224900" wikidata="Q314524" url="?curid=224900" title="Ange-Félix Patassé">
<text>Ange-Félix Patassé (25 January 1937 – 5 April 2011) was a Central African politician who was president of the Central African Republic from 1993 until 2003, when he was deposed by the rebel leader François Bozizé in the 2003 coup d&#x27;état. Patassé was the first president in the CAR&#x27;s history (since 1960) to be chosen in what was generally regarded as a fairly democratic election (1993) in that it was brought about by donor pressure on President André Kolingba and assisted by the United Nations Electoral Assistance Unit. 

He was chosen a second time in a fair election (1999) as well. However, during his first term in office (1993–1999), three military mutinies in 1996–1997 led to increasing conflict between so-called &quot;northerners&quot; (like Patassé) and &quot;southerners&quot; (like his predecessor President André Kolingba). Expatriate mediators and peacekeeping troops were brought in to negotiate peace accords between Patassé and the mutineers and to maintain law and order. During his second term as president, Patassé increasingly lost the support of many of his long-time allies as well as the French, who had intervened to support him during his first term in office. Patassé was ousted in March 2003 and went into exile in Togo.

==Background==

Patassé was born in Paoua, the capital of the northwestern province of Ouham Pendé in the colony of Ubangi-Shari in French Equatorial Africa, and he belonged to the Sara-Kaba ethnic group which predominates in the region around Paoua. Patassé&#x27;s father, Paul Ngakoutou, who had served in the Free French military forces during the Second World War and afterwards worked for the colonial administration in the Province of Ouham-Pendé, was a member of the Sara-kaba people and was raised in a small village to the northeast of Boguila. Patassé&#x27;s mother, Véronique Goumba, belonged to the Kare ethnic group of northwestern Ubangi-Shari. As Patassé spent much of his youth in Paoua he was associated with the Ouham-Pendé province and many of his most loyal political supporters were ethnic Kaba. After attending school in Ubangi-Shari, Patassé studied in an agricultural institute in Puy-de-Dôme, France, where he received a Technical Baccalaureate which allowed him to enroll in the Superior Academy of Tropical Agriculture in Nogent-sur-Marne, and then in the National Agronomical Institute in Paris. Specializing in zootechnology, he received a diploma from the Center for the Artificial Insemination of Domestic Animals in Rambouillet, France. He finished his studies in Paris in 1959, a year before the independence of the Central African Republic.

==Political career==
===1960s–1970s: Rise to power===
Patassé joined the Central African civil service in 1959, shortly before independence. He became an agricultural engineer and agricultural inspector in the Ministry of Agriculture in July 1963, under President David Dacko. In December 1965, Dacko appointed him Director of Agriculture and Minister of Development. In 1966, Jean-Bédel Bokassa took power in a coup d&#x27;état. Patassé was the &quot;cousin&quot; of President Bokassa&#x27;s principal wife, Catherine Denguiadé, and gained the confidence of the new president, serving in almost all the governments formed by Bokassa. After Bokassa&#x27;s creation of the Council for the Central African Revolution (in imitation of the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council), Patassé was named a member of the Council of the Revolution with the rank of Prime Minister in charge of Posts and Communications, Tourism, Water, Forests, Hunting and Fishing, as well as Custodian of the Seats of State (4 September 1976 – 14 December 1976). During this period Patassé followed Bokassa in becoming a convert to Islam for a few months, and changed his name to Mustafa Patassé. After Bokassa became Emperor Bokassa I, Patassé was named Prime Minister and Head of the first Imperial Government. He remained in this position for 2 1/2 years, when a public announcement was made that Patassé had stepped down from office due to health problems. Patassé then left for France, where he remained in exile until the overthrow of Bokassa in September 1979. Shortly before Bokassa&#x27;s overthrow, Patassé announced his opposition to the Emperor and founded the Front de Libération du Peuple Centrafricain (FLPC; Front for the Liberation of the Central African People).

Emperor Bokassa was overthrown and President David Dacko restored to power by the French in 1979. Dacko ordered Patassé to be put under house arrest. Patassé attempted to escape to the Republic of Chad, but failed and was arrested again. He was later released due to alleged health problems.

*Minister of State for Tourism, Water, Forests, Hunting and Fishing (24 May 1976 – 4 September 1976)

===1980s: Return to politics and further exile===

Patassé returned to the CAR to present himself as a candidate for the presidential election of 15 March 1981, after which it was announced that Patassé gained 38% of the votes and thus came in second, after President Dacko. Patassé denounced the election results as rigged. Several months later, on 1 September 1981, General André Kolingba overthrew Dacko in a bloodless coup and took power, after which he forbade political activity in the country. Patassé felt obliged to leave the Central African Republic to live in exile once again, but on 27 February 1982, Patassé returned to the Central African Republic and participated in an unsuccessful coup d&#x27;état attempt against General Kolingba with the help of a few military officers such as General François Bozizé. Four days later, having failed to gain the support of the military forces, Patassé went in disguise to the French Embassy to seek refuge. After heated negotiations between President Kolingba and the French, Patassé was allowed to leave for exile in Togo. After remaining abroad for almost a decade, of which several years were spent in France, Patassé returned to the Central African Republic in 1992 to participate in presidential elections as head of the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (MLPC). The donor community, with the fall of the Soviet Union, saw no need to prop up the Kolingba regime and so had pressed for change helping to organize elections with some help from the UN Electoral Assistance Unit and with logistical support from the French army.

===First presidential term (1993-1999)===
After the Kolingba regime sabotaged a first set of elections in 1992, a second set of elections was held. On the second round on 19 September 1993, Patassé came in first with 37 percent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest competitors, Kolingba, David Dacko and Abel Goumba. He defeated Goumba in the runoff. Largely thanks to the foreign pressure notably from the USA and technical support from the UN, for the first time the elections were fair and democratic. Patassé thus became the first president in the nation&#x27;s history to gain power by such means. When he took office on 22 October 1993; it marked the first (and to date, only) time in the country&#x27;s history that a sitting government peacefully surrendered power to the opposition. During Patassé&#x27;s first six-year term in office (22 October 1993 – 1999), the economy appeared to improve a little as the flow of donor money started up again following the elections and the apparent legitimacy they brought.

Patassé had the support of most of his own Sara-Kaba people, the largest ethno-linguistic group in the Central African Republic, as well as the Souma people of his &quot;hometown&quot; of Paoua and the Kare people of his mother. Most of his supporters lived in the most populous northwestern savanna regions of the CAR, and thus came to be called &quot;northerners&quot;, whereas all previous presidents were from either the forest or Ubangi River regions in the south, and so their supporters came to be called &quot;southerners&quot;. As a populist, Patassé promoted himself as a candidate who represented a majority of the population against the privileges of southerners who held a disproportionate number of lucrative jobs in the public and parastatal sectors of the economy. Most notably, the Yakoma people had already obtained access to European education in the colonial era and were systematically favored under the presidency of Kolingba. As President, Patassé lowered the pay of the Yakoma-dominated army corps (which he distrusted), and conversely created a well-paid presidential guard and other militias mainly composed of &quot;northerners&quot;.

This reversal of a long-standing ethnic inequality heightened tensions in the country and quickly pitted officers and soldiers against Patassé. This led to three consecutive mutinies by badly-paid soldiers in 1996–1997. Destruction of buildings and property during these rebellions had an adverse impact on the economy. The first mutiny began in May 1996. Patassé&#x27;s government successfully regained control with the help of François Bozizé and the French, but his obvious dependency on the French, against whom he had regularly railed, reduced his standing further. His subsequent use of Libyan troops as a body guard did nothing to help his reputation, either locally or with the donor community and the USA even closed their embassy temporarily. The last and most serious mutiny continued until early 1997, when a semblance of order was restored after the signing of the Bangui Agreements, and with the help of troops from Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Mali, Senegal, and Togo. The Security Council of the United Nations approved a mission for peace, MINURCA, in 1998. MINURCA was made up of 1,350 African soldiers. These mutinies greatly increased the tension between &quot;northerners&quot; and &quot;southerners&quot; in the CAR and thus polarized society to a greater extent than before.

===Second presidential term (1999-2003) and coup attempts===

In the presidential election of September 1999, Patassé won easily, defeating former presidents Kolingba and Dacko. He won in the first round with about 51.6% of the vote. Opposition leaders accused the elections of being rigged. During his second term, Patassé became increasingly unpopular. In 2000, his former prime minister Jean-Luc Mandaba and his son Hervé both died within a short span of time, which led to accusations from Mandaba&#x27;s family and the youth movement &quot;Flambeau centrafricain&quot; (FLAC) that Patassé had them poisoned because he suspected them of planning a coup. In May 2001, a failed coup attempt against Patassé took place, in which Kolingba and possibly Bozizé were involved. Both of these officers left the country to evade trial: Kolingba for Uganda, Bozizé for Chad along with military forces that were loyal to him.

In the aftermath of the 2001 coup attempt, the Yakoma were targeted by the Patassé government in reprisal attacks. Hundreds were extrajudicially executed and about 80.000 displaced. Several of these killings took place in broad daylight on the streets of Bangui. Over the course of the following two years, foreign fighters from Libya as well as Congolese rebels from the MLC (led by Jean-Pierre Bemba) were deployed in combat against Bozizé loyalists. The MLC was later found guilty by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of committing war crimes during this intervention, including murder, rape, pillaging and torture.

In October 2002, another coup attempt took place, this time carried out by Bozizé who had returned from Chad with his militias. After a week of fighting, the Patassé government, aided by the Libyans and MLC fighters, emerged victorious. The government was again criticized for widespread human rights abuses by its troops including sexual violence and the killing of dozens to a hundred Chadian nationals in Bangui; additionally, Patassé cracked down on the press.

===2003–2008: Ouster and criminal charges===

Patassé left the country for a conference in Niger in 2003, and in his absence Bozizé seized Bangui on March 15. Although this takeover was internationally condemned, no attempt was made to depose the new leader. Patassé then went into exile in Togo.

Although nominated as the MLPC&#x27;s presidential candidate in November 2004, on 30 December 2004 Patassé was barred from running in the 2005 presidential election due to what the Constitutional Court considered problems with his birth certificate and land title. He was one of seven candidates barred, while five, including Bozizé, were permitted to stand. After an agreement signed in Libreville, Gabon on 22 January 2005, all barred presidential candidates were permitted to stand in the March 13 election except for Patassé, on the grounds that he was the subject of judicial proceedings. The MLPC instead backed his last prime minister, Martin Ziguélé, for president.

Patassé was accused of stealing 70 billion Central African francs from the country&#x27;s treasury. He denied this and in an interview with Agence France-Presse on 21 December 2004, he stated that he had no idea where he could have found so much money to steal in a country with a budget of only 90–100 billion francs. He was also accused of war crimes in connection with the violence that followed a failed 2002 coup attempt, in which rebels from the northern Democratic Republic of the Congo came to Patassé&#x27;s assistance, but were accused of committing many atrocities in the process. Patassé, the Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and three others were charged in September 2004. However, the government of the Central African Republic was unable to arrest them, so the courts referred the matter in April 2006 to the International Criminal Court.

===2008–2011: Return to Bangui, last presidential campaign, and death===
On 7 December 2008, Patassé returned to the Central African Republic for the first time since his ouster in order to participate in a national dialogue, with the government&#x27;s permission. Arriving at the airport in Bangui, he kissed the ground and said that he had &quot;not come to judge but to find grounds for entente and to tackle the problems of the Central African Republic&quot;. At the dialogue, Patassé said that the political situation should be resolved not through removing Bozizé from office, but through &quot;democratic, transparent and fair elections in 2010&quot;.

Patassé said in June 2009 that he would be leaving his Togolese exile and returning to Bangui in preparation for the 2010 presidential election, in which he planned to stand as a candidate. Although Ziguélé had taken over the MPLC, Patassé declared that he would convene a party congress upon his return. He eventually returned to Bangui on 30 October 2009, amidst a &quot;discreet atmosphere&quot;. He subsequently met with Bozizé on November 9. Following the meeting, Patassé thanked Bozizé in a statement and said that they had discussed the Central African Republic&#x27;s problems &quot;in a brotherly atmosphere&quot;. He also reiterated his intention to stand as a presidential candidate in 2010.

Patassé placed second in the January 2011 presidential election, far behind Bozizé, although ill-health had impeded his campaigning. He suffered from diabetes and was prevented from leaving the country for treatment in Equatorial Guinea in March 2011. He was eventually allowed to travel, but was hospitalised at Douala in Cameroon en route to Malabo, and died there on 5 April 2011. There were calls for a state funeral.

==Personal life==
Patassé&#x27;s first wife was Lucienne Patassé, with whom he had seven children - four girls and three boys. Patassé separated from and divorced Lucienne during his first exile in Togo from 1982 to 1992. Lucienne Patassé, who was elected to the National Assembly in 1993, died on 29 July 2000, at the age of 56.

He then married a Togolese woman, Angèle Patassé, who became first lady during his presidency. The couple had three children. Ange-Félix and Angèle Patassé lived in exile in at a villa in Lomé, Togo, beginning in 2003. Angèle Patassé died in Lomé on 3 December 2007 at the age of 52.

<text>Lake Bonneville was the largest Late Pleistocene paleolake in the Great Basin of western North America. It was a pluvial lake that formed in response to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in evaporation as a result of cooler temperatures. The lake covered much of what is now western Utah and at its highest level extended into present-day Idaho and Nevada. Many other hydrographically closed basins in the Great Basin contained expanded lakes during the Late Pleistocene, including Lake Lahontan in northwestern Nevada.

==Geologic description==

Shorelines of Lake Bonneville are visible above Salt Lake City along the western front of the Wasatch Mountains and on other mountains throughout the Bonneville basin. These shorelines appear as shelves or benches that protrude from the mountainside above the valley floor, are visible on the ground from long distances and on satellite images, and have both depositional and erosional segments along their lengths. Three shorelines of Lake Bonneville that can be traced throughout the basin have been given names: Stansbury, Bonneville, and Provo. The Stansbury and Bonneville shorelines formed during the transgressive phase of Lake Bonneville; the Provo shoreline formed during the overflowing phase. Numerous other unnamed shorelines, which cannot be mapped everywhere in the basin, some of which formed during the transgressive phase and some during the regressive phase, are also present on piedmont slopes and alluvial fans. At its maximum, when Lake Bonneville was more than deep and almost in surface area, it covered almost as much area as modern Lake Michigan, although its shoreline was more complex with many islands and peninsulas. Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, and Sevier Lake are the largest post-Bonneville lakes in the Bonneville basin.

== Causes of lake expansion and contraction ==
Lake Bonneville was not a proglacial lake although it formed between about 30,000 and 13,000 years ago, when glaciers at many places on Earth were expanded relative to today during the last major glaciation. For most of its existence (that is, during the transgressive plus regressive phases) Lake Bonneville had no river outlet and occupied a hydrographically closed basin. Changes in lake level were the result of changes in water balance caused by climate change (a simplified version of the water-balance equation is inputs equal outputs plus-or-minus storage changes). Storage changes are equal to volume changes, and changes in volume are correlated with changes in lake level. When inputs (e.g., precipitation; runoff in rivers) were greater than outputs (e.g., evaporation from the lake surface; evapotranspiration in the basin), lake level rose, and when outputs were greater than inputs, lake level fell. Changes in global atmospheric circulation led to changes in the water budget of Lake Bonneville and other lakes in the Great Basin of western North America. Mountain glaciers in the Bonneville drainage basin stored less than 5% of the water that Lake Bonneville held at its maximum and so even if all of the mountain glaciers in the basin melted at once and the water flowed into the lake (that did not happen since it took thousands of years for the mountain glaciers to melt, and Lake Bonneville was falling by that time), it would have had little effect on lake level. Lake Bonneville had no river connection with the huge North American ice sheets. While Lake Bonneville existed the patterns of wave- and current-forming winds were not significantly affected by the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets in northern North America.

== The name &quot;Bonneville&quot; and its discovery ==
Lake Bonneville was named by the geologist G.K. Gilbert after Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville (1796–1878), a French-born officer in the United States Army who was also a fur trapper and explorer in the American West. Bonneville&#x27;s adventures were popularized by Washington Irving in the 1800s, but Captain Bonneville probably never saw Great Salt Lake or the Great Basin. G.K. Gilbert was one of the greatest geologists of the 19th Century, and his monumental work on Lake Bonneville, published in 1890, set the stage for scientific research on the paleolake that continues today. Gilbert was the first person to describe the major features of Lake Bonneville, however, many other early European and American explorers in the region recognized the shorelines of the ancient lake, such as Captain John C. Frémont in 1843 and even earlier by Father Silvestre Velez de Escalante in 1776. Escalante, in a journal entry after visiting what would be named Utah Lake wrote, &quot;This place, which we named Llano Salado, because we found some thin white shells there, seems to have once had a much larger lake than the present one.&quot; Although a general description and understanding of Lake Bonneville has been established by the work of many people, details of the paleolake, including its history and connections to global environmental systems, will be pursued for many years to come.

== Geologic history ==
Lake Bonneville began to rise from elevations similar to those of modern Great Salt Lake about 30,000 years ago. During its early transgressive phase the lake fluctuated within a few 10s of meters of the level of modern Great Salt Lake, but after about 24,000 years ago it began a rapid rise to higher elevations, reaching its highest elevation (the Bonneville shoreline) about 17,500 years ago. During its transgressive phase in the closed basin (an endorheic basin), lake level oscillated because of changes in climate. At its highest level the lake had risen to the lowest point on its basin rim and had begun to overflow into the Snake River drainage basin near Red Rock Pass in what is now southeastern Idaho. The overflow, which would have begun as a trickle across the dam formed by the Marsh Creek alluvial fan, quickly evolved into a tremendous flood, the Bonneville flood, which charged down the Marsh Creek valley to the Portneuf River, into the Snake River and then into the Columbia River and Pacific Ocean. Groundwater sapping on the north slope of the Marsh Creek alluvial fan, which began long before the lake had reached its highest level, added to the instability and ultimate collapse of the fan-dam.

The Bonneville flood probably lasted less than a year, during which time almost of water flowed out of the lake basin with a maximum discharge of about . Downcutting during the flood through the Marsh Creek alluvial-fan deposits and into the underlying Neogene sand, mud, and landslide debris, caused lake level to drop about . River flow from the lake across the Red Rock Pass threshold and out of the lake basin continued non-catastrophically for at least 1000 years after the flood ended; the Provo shoreline formed during this overflowing phase. The Provo shoreline is distinguished from other shorelines of Lake Bonneville by its topographic position, strong development, and thick accumulations of microbialite (tufa). At the end of the overflowing phase, possibly as early as about 16,500 years ago, climate change and a shift to a negative water balance (more water evaporated from the surface of the lake than entered the lake by rivers, direct precipitation, or groundwater) caused the lake to return to its closed-basin status as it declined to lower levels during the regressive phase. By 13,000 years ago the lake had fallen to an elevation similar to the average elevation of modern Great Salt Lake. During the regressive phase lake level declined approximately 660 ft (200 m) in about 3500 years because of a change to warmer and drier climate; this was a lake-level decline of roughly 2/3 of the maximum depth of Lake Bonneville. Although Lake Bonneville and the Great Salt Lake are collectively one lake system, the name &quot;Lake Bonneville&quot; is applied to the lake during the period from 30,000 to 13,000 years ago, and the name &quot;Great Salt Lake&quot; since 13,000 years ago.

Lake Bonneville was anomalous in the long-term history of the basin. As the largest of four deep lakes in the basin during the past 800,000 years, Lake Bonneville plus the other three deep Pleistocene lakes, persisted for less than 10% of the period. The conditions experienced in the basin today are typical of over 90% of the past 800,000 years: a dry desert basin with a few scattered low-elevation lakes, the largest of which (Great Salt Lake) was hypersaline. For most of the time between the end of the youngest of the deep pre-Bonneville lakes (the Little Valley lake cycle, about 150,000 years ago) and the initial rise of Lake Bonneville about 30,000 years ago, the lake would have resembled modern Great Salt Lake in surface area and depth. A short episode of slightly higher lake levels during the Cutler Dam lake cycle occurred about 60,000 years ago; at this time a moderate-sized lake rose above the level of Great Salt Lake, but not as high as Lake Bonneville.
In his monograph on Lake Bonneville, G.K. Gilbert called the offshore deposits of Lake Bonneville the &quot;White Marl&quot;. Although the name &quot;White Marl&quot; has not been used by the geologic community in a formal sense, the informal term &quot;white marl&quot; (or &quot;Bonneville marl&quot;) is frequently employed. The Bonneville marl at locations far from sources of clastic sediment (gravel, sand, and silt), such as river deltas or active wave zones, is dominated by clay-sized particles of calcium carbonate that precipitated chemically from the lake water. Most of this calcium carbonate is in the form of the mineral calcite, but aragonite is common in Bonneville marl in the Sevier basin and in the lower part of the Bonneville marl stratigraphic section in the main body. Aragonite is the dominant carbonate mineral in sediments of post-Bonneville Great Salt Lake. Dropstones, probably mostly derived from shore ice, but possibly also from floating root balls, are common in the marl, and consist of granule- to boulder-sized clasts.

The Bonneville flood had catastrophic effects along the Snake River in what is now Idaho, but the influence of the flood can also be detected within the lake basin where a distinctive layer of sediment was deposited. The Bonneville flood bed can be identified in many surface exposures below the Provo shoreline and in sediment cores. The flood bed is characterized by an abrupt contact at its base between massive marl, which was deposited in the deepest water of Lake Bonneville, and finely laminated or ripple-laminated sandy marl, which was deposited by bottom currents during the flood. In places the Bonneville flood bed is composed of reworked ostracode shells. The contact at the top of the flood bed is transitional to massive marl that was deposited on the lake floor during Provo time. The flood bed is best developed and most obvious in straits between partially submerged mountain ranges or in places where bottom currents were strong as lake water flowed toward its outlet at Red Rock Pass. Because the Bonneville flood bed was deposited in less than a year, it is useful as a well-dated (~17,500 years ago) stratigraphic marker within the Bonneville deposits.

In previous publications the &quot;Gilbert shoreline&quot; was regarded as one of the prominent shorelines in the Bonneville basin, but this interpretation has been revised. The Gilbert episode (now referred to as the Currey cycle of Great Salt Lake) was a rise of Great Salt Lake about 50 ft (15 m) higher than modern average levels. Sediments deposited near the highest level of the Currey cycle are well dated at about 12,700 years BP. A mappable shoreline at the maximum level of the Currey cycle has not been recognized.

== Isostasy ==
The shorelines of Lake Bonneville have been warped by isostatic processes, as was recognized by Gilbert and extensively studied since Gilbert&#x27;s day. Earth&#x27;s crust subsided beneath the weight of the water while the lake existed, but when the lake evaporated and the water load was considerably reduced, the crust beneath the lake basin rebounded. As a result, the elevation of the Bonneville shoreline is higher in the Lakeside Mountains, elevation , west of the Great Salt Lake near the center of the Lake Bonneville water load, than at Red Rock Pass, , where the lake was very shallow. As an example of isostatic deformation of the shorelines, the elevation of the Bonneville shoreline near Salt Lake City is , but on Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake, the elevation of the same shoreline is .

== Fossils, volcanic ashes, etc. ==
In addition to the abundant geological features produced by Lake Bonneville, such as shorelines and sediments, fossilized fish bones and scales reveal information about the physical and chemical characteristics of the paleolake. Pollen from plants that lived in the Bonneville basin is abundant in Bonneville marl. Invertebrate fossils in Lake Bonneville deposits include mollusks and ostracodes, and bones of extinct mammals are found in Pleistocene deposits in the Bonneville basin. Volcanic ashes in sediments of Lake Bonneville help with correlations and aid in deciphering lake history. Lake Bonneville shorelines, and those of other paleolakes on Earth, are good analogs for shorelines on other planets, such as Mars.

<text>The String Quartet No. 5, Sz. 102, BB 110 by Béla Bartók was written between 6 August and 6 September 1934. It is one of six string quartets by Bartok.

The work is in five movements:

Like the String Quartet No. 4 and several other works by Bartók, the piece is in an arch form.

Additionally, the first movement, which is in a sort of sonata form, is itself arch-like, in that each section of exposition is given in reverse order during the recapitulation – the melodies of each section are also inverted (played upside-down). Bartók himself pointed out that the keys used in the movement ascend in the steps of the whole tone scale: the exposition is in B, C and D; the development is in E; and the recapitulation is in F, A and B.

The three middle movements are all in ternary form, of which the third is in the unevenly-divided &quot;aksak&quot; time signatures typical of Bulgarian folk music: for the main scherzo, and in the trio. The last movement is again arch-like: Bartók described it as being in the form ABCB′A′ with a coda to round things off.

The two slow movements, the second &quot;Adagio molto&quot; and the fourth &quot;Andante&quot; are great examples of Bartók&#x27;s night music style: eerie dissonances, imitations of natural sounds, and lonely melodies.

The work was commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge and is dedicated to her. It was premiered by the Kolisch Quartet in Washington, D.C., on 8 April 1935 and first published in 1936 by Universal Edition.

<doc id="224904" wikidata="Q3308319" url="?curid=224904" title="Rule against perpetuities">
<text>The rule against perpetuities is a legal rule in common law that prevents people from using legal instruments (usually a deed or a will) to exert control over the ownership of private property for a time long beyond the lives of people living at the time the instrument was written. Specifically, the rule forbids a person from creating future interests (traditionally contingent remainders and executory interests) in property that would vest beyond 21 years after the lifetimes of those living at the time of creation of the interest, often expressed as a &quot;life in being plus twenty-one years&quot;. In essence, the rule prevents a person from putting qualifications and criteria in a deed or a will that would continue to affect the ownership of property long after he or she has died, a concept often referred to as control by the &quot;dead hand&quot; or &quot;mortmain&quot;.

The basic elements of the rule against perpetuities originated in England in the 17th century and were &quot;crystallized&quot; into a single rule in the 19th century. The rule&#x27;s classic formulation was given in 1886 by the American legal scholar John Chipman Gray:
The rule against perpetuities serves a number of purposes. First, English courts have long recognized that allowing owners to attach long-lasting contingencies to their property harms the ability of future generations to freely buy and sell the property, since few people would be willing to buy property that had unresolved issues regarding its ownership hanging over it. Second, judges often had concerns about the dead being able to impose excessive limitations on the ownership and use of property by those still living. For this reason, the rule allows testators to put contingencies on ownership only provided that no interest created vest later than 21 years after the death of some specified person alive at the creation of the interest. Lastly, the rule against perpetuities was sometimes used to prevent very large, possibly aristocratic, estates from being kept in one family for more than one or two generations at a time.

The rule also applies to options to acquire property. Often, one of the objectives of delaying the time of vesting is to avoid or reduce taxation of some sort. For example, a bequest in a will may be to one&#x27;s grandchildren, often with a life interest to one&#x27;s surviving spouse and then to the children, to avoid the payment of multiple death duties or inheritance taxes on the testator&#x27;s estate. The rule against perpetuities was one of the devices developed to at least limit this tax avoidance strategy.

==Historical background==
The rule has its origin in the &quot;Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s Case&quot; of 1682. That case concerned Henry, 22nd Earl of Arundel, who had tried to create a shifting executory limitation so that some of his property would pass to his eldest son (who was mentally deficient) and then to his second son, and other property would pass to his second son, but then to his fourth son. The estate plan also included provisions for shifting property many generations later if certain conditions should occur.

When his second son, Henry, succeeded to his elder brother&#x27;s property, he did not want to pass the other property to his younger brother, Charles. Charles sued to enforce his interest, and the court (in this instance, the House of Lords) held that such a shifting condition could not exist indefinitely. The judges believed that tying up property too long beyond the lives of people living at the time was wrong, although the exact period was not determined until another case, &quot;Cadell v. Palmer&quot;, 150 years later.

The rule against perpetuities is closely related to another doctrine in the common law of property, the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation. Both stem from an underlying principle or reference in the common law disapproving of restraints on property rights. However, while a violation of the rule against perpetuities is also a violation of the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation, the reciprocal is not true. As one has stated, &quot;The rule against perpetuities is an ancient, but still vital, rule of property law intended to enhance marketability of property interests by limiting remoteness of vesting.&quot; For this reason, another court has declared that the provisions of the rule are predicated upon &quot;public policy&quot; and thus &quot;constitute non-waivable, legal prohibitions.&quot;

==Common law==
&quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines the rule against perpetuities as &quot;[t]he common-law rule prohibiting a grant of an estate unless the interest must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years (plus a period of gestation to cover a posthumous birth) after the death of some person alive when the interest was created.&quot;

At common law, the length of time was fixed at 21 years after the death of an identifiable person alive at the time the interest was created. This is often expressed as &quot;lives in being plus twenty-one years&quot;. Under the common law rule, one does not look to whether an interest actually will vest more than 21 years after the lives in being. Instead, if there exists any possibility at the time of the grant, however unlikely or remote, that an interest will vest outside the perpetuities period, the interest is void and is stricken from the grant.

The rule does not apply to interests in the grantor himself. For example, the grant &quot;For A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises, then to B&quot; would violate the rule as to B. The conveyance to B would be stricken, leaving &quot;To A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises.&quot; This would create a &quot;fee simple determinable&quot; in A, with a possibility of &quot;reverter&quot; in the grantor (or the grantor&#x27;s heirs). The grant to B would be void as it is possible alcohol would be sold on the premises more than 21 years after the deaths of A, B, and the grantor. However, as the rule does not apply to grantors, the possibility of reverter in the grantor (or his heirs) would be valid.

==Statutory modification==
Many jurisdictions have statutes that either cancel out the rule entirely or clarify it as to the period of time and persons affected:

* In England and Wales, dispositions of property subject to the rule before 14 July 1964 remain subject to the rule. The Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 provides for the effect of the rule of interests created thereafter. The Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009 codified the &quot;wait and see&quot; doctrine developed by courts and made the perpetuity period 125 years.
* In Scotland there are similar provisions under the Trusts (Scotland) Act 1921.
* In the Republic of Ireland, the rule was abolished as of 1 December 2009.
* The states of the United States have differing approaches.
** Some states follow the &quot;wait-and-see approach&quot;, or &quot;second look doctrine&quot; or apply the &quot;doctrine&quot;. Under the wait-and-see approach, the validity of a suspect future interest is determined on the basis of facts as they now exist at the end of the measuring life, and not at the time the interest was created. Under the cy-près doctrine, if the interest does violate the rule against perpetuities, the court may reform the grant in a way that does not violate the rule and reduce any offensive age contingency to 21 years.
** 29 states or territories have adopted the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (or some variant of it), which extends the waiting period typically to 90 years after creation of the interest.
** At least six states have repealed the rule in its entirety, and many have extended the vesting period of the wait-and-see approach for an extremely long period of time (in Florida, for example, up to 360 years for trusts).
* In Australia, each of the states has followed the English approach to perpetuities, with statutory modification. In New South Wales, for example, the &quot;Perpetuities Act 1984&quot; limits perpetuities to 80 years, but also adopts the &quot;wait and see&quot; approach. However, South Australia has abolished the rule.

=== Application in the United States ===
The rule against perpetuities is one of the most difficult topics encountered by law school students. It is notoriously difficult to apply properly: in 1961, the Supreme Court of California ruled that it was not legal malpractice for an attorney to draft a will that inadvertently violated the rule. In the United States, the common law rule has been abolished by statute in Alaska, Idaho, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Rhode Island, and South Dakota.

A new US Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities was published in 1986 that adopts the wait-and-see approach with a flat waiting period of 90 years in place of the rule of life in being plus 21 years. , 31 jurisdictions have adopted the new rule: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia, and the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2015, the New York State Legislature considered whether or not to adopt the new rule.

Other jurisdictions apply the &quot;cy-près&quot; doctrine, which validates contingent remainders and executory interests. Under certain circumstances, the traditional rule would have considered these remainders and interests to be void.

==Applications==
In 1919, Michigan lumber baron Wellington R. Burt died, leaving a will that specified that apart from small allowances, his estate was not to be distributed until 21 years after the death of the last of his grandchildren to be born in his lifetime. This condition was met in 2010, 21 years after his granddaughter Marion Landsill died in November 1989. After the heirs reached an agreement, the estate, which had reached an estimated value of $100–110 million, was finally distributed in May 2011, 92 years after his death.

Real estate developer Henry G. Freeman established the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, which was intended to provide an annuity of $12,000 per year to the First Lady of the United States. Freeman died in 1917, but no presidential spouse received any payments from the fund until after Freeman&#x27;s then-living descendants died out in 1989. Although Freeman&#x27;s will stated that the payments were intended &quot;to continue in force as long as this glorious government lasts&quot;, the trustees of the fund determined that maintaining the trust for more than 21 years after 1989 would violate the rule against perpetuities, and terminated the trust by agreement with then-First Lady Michelle Obama in 2010 to give the fund to charity instead. Hence, only four First Ladies ever received payments from the fund.

In 2023, the Walt Disney Company and the Reedy Creek Improvement District signed a development agreement that enacted restrictive covenants to limit the district&#x27;s governing power over Disney properties in Florida, which include Walt Disney World, just prior to a state takeover of the district&#x27;s board. The agreement referenced the rule against perpetuities, stating that if a perpetual term is deemed invalid, then the agreement &quot;shall continue until twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, king of England, living as of the date of this agreement.&quot;

==Charity-to-charity exception==
The rule never applies to conditions placed on a conveyance to a charity that, if violated, would convey the property to another charity. For example, a conveyance &quot;to the Red Cross, so long as it operates an office on the property, but if it does not, then to the World Wildlife Fund&quot; would be valid under the rule, because both parties are charities. Even though the interest of the fund might not vest for hundreds of years, the conveyance would nonetheless be held valid. The exception, however, does not apply if the conveyance, upon violation of the condition, is not from one charity to another charity. Thus, a devise &quot;to John Smith, so long as no one operates a liquor store on the premises, but if someone does operate a liquor store on the premises, then to the Roman Catholic Church&quot; would violate the rule. The exception would not apply to the transfer from John Smith to the Roman Catholic Church because John Smith is not a charity. Also, if the original conveyance was &quot;to John Smith and his heirs for as long as John Smith or his heirs do not use the premises to sell liquor, but if he does, then to the Red Cross&quot; this would violate the rule because it could be more than 21 years before the interest in Red Cross would vest, and therefore, their interest is void. Thus leaving John with a fee simple determinable and the grantor a possibility of reverter.

A famous actual example of this exception applies to Harvard&#x27;s Widener Library. Eleanor Elkins Widener, the library&#x27;s benefactor, stipulated that no &quot;additions or alterations&quot; could be made to the façade of the building. If the university ever changes the façade, it loses the building to the Boston Public Library. Because both Harvard and the Boston Public Library are charities, the restriction can apply indefinitely.

Conversely, Harvard would benefit if Boston&#x27;s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum violated conditions established in the will of its namesake and founder. Her will stipulates that if the museum is significantly altered, if artwork she placed is moved elsewhere in the museum or off the walls, if any of the works in her collection are sold or otherwise conveyed to others, the entire collection and the museum building become Harvard&#x27;s property.

==Saving clause==
In order to satisfy the rule against perpetuities, the class of people must be limited and determinable. Thus, one cannot say in a deed &quot;until the last of the people in the world now living dies, plus 21 years&quot;. To avoid problems caused by incorrectly drafted legal instruments, practitioners in some jurisdictions include a &quot;saving clause&quot; almost universally as a form of . This standard clause is commonly called the &quot;Kennedy clause&quot; or the &quot;Rockefeller clause&quot; because the determinable &quot;lives in being&quot; are designated as the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy (the father of John F. Kennedy), or John D. Rockefeller. Both designate well-known families with many descendants, and are consequently suitable for named, identifiable lives in being. For a time, it was popular to use a royal lives clause, and make the term of a deed run until the last of the descendants of (for example) Queen Victoria now living dies plus 21 years.

==Related rules==
Jurisdictions may limit usufruct periods. For example, if a corporation builds a ski slope, and gives rights of use (usufruct) as gifts to corporate partners, these cannot last in perpetuity, but must terminate after a period that must be specified, e.g. 10 years. A perpetual usufruct is thus forbidden and &quot;perpetual&quot; might mean a long, but finite period, such as 99 years. Here usufruct is distinct from a share, which may be held in perpetuity.

==Illustrations==
The fertile octogenarian and the unborn widow are two legal fictions from the law of real property (and trusts) that can be used either to invoke the rule against perpetuities to make an interest in property void or, alternatively and much more frequently, to demonstrate the seemingly bizarre results that can occur as a result of the rule. The rule itself, simply stated, makes a future interest in property void if it can be logically proven that there is some possibility of the interest not vesting or failing within 21 years after the end of a life in being at the time the interest is created.

===The fertile octogenarian===
The fertile octogenarian is a hypothetical character that comes up when applying the rule against perpetuities. The rule presumes that anyone, even an octogenarian (i.e., someone between 80 and 89 years of age) can bear a child, regardless of sex or health. For instance, suppose that a will devises a piece of land known as Blackacre &quot;to A for her life, and then to the first of A&#x27;s children to reach 25 years of age&quot;. A is, at the time the will is probated, an 85-year-old woman. In applying the rule against perpetuities, an imaginative lawyer will argue (and a court must accept under the common law rule itself) that A could have a child in her 86th year and then in her 87th year all of A&#x27;s other children could die, then in her 88th year A herself could die. Because the interest will not vest until her new child reaches 25 years of age, which cannot happen until more than 21 years after A and her other children (together who form the &quot;lives in being&quot; to which the rule refers) have all died, the rule against perpetuities makes the entire gift &quot;to the first of A&#x27;s children to reach 25 years of age&quot; void. A will hold Blackacre for life, and then the property will revert to the person whose will transferred it to A in the first place. (Actually, it will go to that person&#x27;s estate, since the will was probated only after their death.)

While it is true that there is often no statutory maximum age limit to perform an adoption, and adopted children are often treated the same as natural children, so an 86-year-old woman who adopts a newborn child is legally in the same position as an 86-year-old woman who gives birth, the fertile octogenarian rule predates the laws allowing legal adoption.

The legal fiction of the fertile octogenarian assumes that a living person, regardless of sex, age, or physical condition, will always be capable of having more children, thus allowing an interest to vest 21 years after all the lives in being at the time of the grant are dead. Couples have been known to marry in their late eighties.

In certain places this assumption will be limited to a fixed age set by statute. Furthermore, many jurisdictions have discarded old common-law fictions such as the &quot;fertile octogenarian&quot;.

A related legal fiction, which assumes that a living person is fertile at birth, is known as the precocious toddler.

===The unborn widow===
The problem of the unborn widow is a frequently used illustration of the odd outcomes of the traditional rule against perpetuities. The unborn widow rule prohibits an unidentified widow from being treated as a validating life. If, for example, a grantor&#x27;s will devised land &quot;to my son, for life; then to his wife [or widow], for life; then to his children living at the time of her death&quot;, the children&#x27;s contingent remainder (contingent on their status as &quot;living&quot; at the time of the widow&#x27;s death) would be invalid, even if the grantor&#x27;s son was an elderly and already-married man. Regardless of the age of the grantor&#x27;s son, he could leave or lose by death his current wife and subsequently marry another woman who was not yet born at the time of conveyance; thus the widow that survived him would not be, with certainty, a life in being at the time of conveyance.

===Other examples===
Other hypothetically relevant possibilities which almost never actually occur but have been invoked by lawyers or courts to invalidate transfers under the rule against perpetuities include the slothful executor (a situation where the executor of the estate does not probate the will for many years after the testator&#x27;s death), the magic gravel pit (a transfer to be made as soon as a gravel pit is out of gravel may not vest for hundreds of years), the war that never ends (a transfer to be made at the end of a war might never happen), and other similar situations.

===Criticism and humor===
Because these hypothetical scenarios show how a reasonable gift can be voided based on so unlikely an outcome, they have generated much criticism among legal scholars, resulting in the abrogation of the rule against perpetuities by statute in many jurisdictions. Many U.S. states have adopted laws modifying the application of the rule by requiring courts to &quot;wait and see&quot; for a period of years, sometimes as long as 360 years (which effectively negates the possibility of litigation ensuing during the life of any person alive at the same time of the author of the will).

Some jurisdictions have ameliorated specific problems of the rule by creating statutory presumptions to counter those problems. Under such statutes, for example, a woman is presumed to no longer be fertile after a particular age (typically 55), and a gift to a person&#x27;s widow or widower is presumed to vest in whoever was that person&#x27;s spouse at the time of the gift.

These rules have also long been a target of legal humorists.

==Cultural references==
The rule against perpetuities is the basis of a prominent plot point in the 1981 film &quot;Body Heat&quot;. The rule is also the basis of a secondary plot line in the 2011 film &quot;The Descendants&quot;—though its actual content is not discussed in the film, making it a MacGuffin.

<text>Justincase was an American alternative-pop band from Charlotte, North Carolina, best known for their 2002 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Us&quot;, which was co-written by Michelle Branch, who was one of the band&#x27;s early champions. Consisting of teen siblings Hannah, Justin, and Nick Tosco, the band was signed to Maverick Records. Justin was lead vocalist and guitarist as well as principal songwriter. Nick played drums, and Hannah was on bass.

== History ==
Band members Justin (the oldest, born 1983), Nick, and Hannah (the youngest) Tosco grew up in a musical household. Their father, John, worked in the Charlotte music scene and also taught guitar, while their mother, Holly Tosco, worked as a piano teacher. Justin was five years old when he wrote his first song, which was about baseball. The trio began playing gigs together before all were in junior high school. Their first concert was at their middle school&#x27;s talent show in 1998.

The Toscos met Michelle Branch before her debut on Maverick Records and became friends over the Internet before meeting in Las Vegas for a music convention in 2000. Justincase was signed to Maverick Records in late 2001 with the help of Branch.

The band released its self-titled debut album on October 29, 2002. The album included several collaborations with Michelle Branch, including the lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Us&quot;. Michelle Branch promoted the album on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live. Other media appearances included the radio show &quot;Open House Party&quot; and Nickelodeon&#x27;s TV show &quot;All That&quot;. After their first music video was shown on MTV, Wal-Mart agreed to sponsor a short tour to further promote the album. The band played several solo shows, and also opened for Nick Carter on his &quot;Backstreet Boy&quot; tour. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer David Menconi called Justincase an &quot;act to watch,&quot; describing the group as &quot;three clean-cut teenage siblings&quot; whose music is &quot;steeped in classic-rock verities.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; critic Kevin Amorim called the band&#x27;s music &quot;rootsy feel-good Hooters-esque rock (hey, at least it wasn&#x27;t emo).&quot; Guitar-maker Ibanez published a series of ads featuring the band.

Despite heavy promotion, the album lagged commercially. Lackluster sales numbers caused Maverick to drop the band in 2003, and they have been unable to secure another recording contract. The band was indicated that they were on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; while its members attended college and played the occasional local show. Lead singer Justin Tosco was also performing with Policy, another local band.

<text>The Great Basin () is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds, those with no outlets to the ocean, in North America. It spans nearly all of Nevada, much of Utah, and portions of California, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and Baja California. It is noted for both its arid climate and the basin and range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin in Death Valley to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than away at the summit of Mount Whitney. The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes, ecoregions, and deserts.

==Definition==
The term &quot;Great Basin&quot; is applied to hydrographic, biological, floristic, physiographic, topographic, and ethnographic geographic areas. The name was originally coined by John C. Frémont, who, based on information gleaned from Joseph R. Walker as well as his own travels, recognized the hydrographic nature of the landform as &quot;having no connection to the ocean&quot;. The hydrographic definition is the most commonly used, and is the only one with a definitive border. The other definitions yield not only different geographical boundaries of &quot;Great Basin&quot; regions but regional borders that vary from source to source.

The &quot;Great Basin Desert&quot; is defined by plant and animal communities, and, according to the National Park Service, its boundaries approximate the hydrographic Great Basin but exclude the southern &quot;panhandle&quot;.

The &quot;Great Basin Province&quot; was defined by botanist Armen Takhtajan to extend well beyond the boundaries of the hydrographically defined Great Basin: it includes the Snake River Plain, the Colorado Plateau, the Uinta Basin, and parts of Arizona north of the Mogollon Rim.

The &quot;Great Basin physiographic section&quot; is a geographic division of the Basin and Range Province defined by Nevin Fenneman in 1931. The United States Geological Survey adapted Fenneman&#x27;s scheme in their Physiographic division of the United States. The &quot;section&quot; is somewhat larger than the hydrographic definition.

The &quot;Great Basin culture area&quot;, or indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, is a cultural classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas and a cultural region located between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. The culture area covers approximately , or just less than twice the area of the hydrographic Great Basin.

==Hydrology==

The hydrographic Great Basin is a area that once drained internally. All precipitation in the region evaporated, sank underground or flowed into lakes (mostly saline). As observed by Fremont, creeks, streams, or rivers find no outlet to either the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Ocean. The region is bounded by the Wasatch Mountains to the east, the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges to the west, and the Snake River Basin to the north. The south rim is less distinct. The Great Basin includes most of Nevada, half of Utah, substantial portions of Oregon and California, and small areas of Idaho, Wyoming, and Baja California, Mexico. The term &quot;Great Basin&quot; is slightly misleading; the region comprises many small basins. The Great Salt Lake, Pyramid Lake, and the Humboldt Sink are a few of the &quot;drains&quot; in the Great Basin. The Salton Sink is another closed basin within the Great Basin.

The Great Basin Divide separates the Great Basin from the watersheds draining to the Pacific Ocean. The southernmost portion of the Great Basin is the watershed area of the Laguna Salada. The Great Basin&#x27;s longest and largest river is the Bear River of , and the largest single watershed is the Humboldt River drainage of roughly . Most Great Basin precipitation is snow, and the precipitation that neither evaporates nor is extracted for human use will sink into groundwater aquifers, while evaporation of collected water occurs from geographic sinks. Lake Tahoe, North America&#x27;s largest alpine lake, is part of the Great Basin&#x27;s central Lahontan subregion.

==Ecology==


The hydrographic Great Basin contains multiple deserts and ecoregions, each with its own distinctive set of flora and fauna. The ecological boundaries and divisions in the Great Basin are unclear.

The Great Basin overlaps four different deserts: portions of the hot Mojave and Colorado (a region within the Sonoran Desert) Deserts to the south, and the cold Great Basin and Oregon High Deserts in the north. The deserts can be distinguished by their plants: the Joshua tree and creosote bush occur in the hot deserts, while the cold deserts have neither. The cold deserts are generally higher than the hot and have more even spread of precipitation throughout the year.

The climate and flora of the Great Basin are strongly dependent on elevation; as the elevation increases, the temperature decreases and precipitation increases. Because of this, forests can occur at higher elevations. Utah juniper/single-leaf pinyon (southern regions) and mountain mahogany (northern regions) form open pinyon-juniper woodland on the slopes of most ranges. Stands of limber pine and Great Basin bristlecone pine (&quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;) can be found in some of the higher ranges. In riparian areas with dependable water cottonwoods (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;) and quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) groves exist.

Because the forest ecosystem is distinct from a typical desert, some authorities, such as the World Wildlife Fund, separate the mountains of the Great Basin desert into their own ecoregion: the Great Basin montane forests. Many rare and endemic species occur in this ecoregion, because the individual mountain ranges are isolated from each other. During the Last Glacial Period, the Great Basin was wetter. As it dried during the Holocene epoch, some species retreated to the higher isolated mountains and have high genetic diversity.

Other authorities divide the Great Basin into different ecoregions, depending on their own criteria. Armen Takhtajan defined the &quot;Great Basin floristic province&quot;. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency divides the Great Basin into three ecoregions roughly according to latitude: the Northern Basin and Range ecoregion, the Central Basin and Range ecoregion, and the Mojave Basin and Range ecoregion.

===Fauna===
Great Basin wildlife includes pronghorn, mule deer, mountain lion, and lagomorphs such as black-tailed jackrabbit and desert cottontail and the coyotes that prey on them. Packrats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents are also common, and are predominantly nocturnal. Elk and bighorn sheep are present but uncommon. Small lizards such as the Great Basin fence lizard, longnose leopard lizard and horned lizard are common, especially in lower elevations. Rattlesnakes and gopher snakes are also present. The Inyo Mountains salamander is endangered. Shorebirds such as phalaropes and curlews can be found in wet areas. American white pelicans are common at Pyramid Lake. Golden eagles are also very common in the Great Basin. Mourning dove, western meadowlark, black-billed magpie, and common raven are other common bird species.

Two endangered species of fish are found in Pyramid Lake: the Cui-ui sucker fish (endangered 1967) and the Lahontan cutthroat trout (threatened 1970).

Large invertebrates include tarantulas (genus &quot;Aphonopelma&quot;) and Mormon crickets. Exotic species, including chukar, grey partridge, and Himalayan snowcock, have been successfully introduced to the Great Basin, although the latter has only thrived in the Ruby Mountains. Cheatgrass, an invasive species which was unintentionally introduced, forms a critical portion of their diets. Feral horses (mustangs) and feral burros are highly reproductive, and ecosystem-controversial, alien species. Most of the Great Basin is open range and domestic cattle and sheep are widespread.

==Geology==

The Great Basin includes valleys, basins, lakes and mountain ranges of the Basin and Range Province. 

The basin and range topography is the result of extension and thinning of the lithosphere, which is composed of crust and upper mantle. Extensional environments like the Basin and Range are characterized by listric normal faulting, or faults that level out with depth. Opposing normal faults link at depth producing a horst and graben geometry, where horst refers to the upthrown fault block and graben to the down dropped fault block.

Sediment build-up over thousands of years filled the down-faulted basins between ranges and created relatively flat lacustrine plains from Pleistocene lake beds of the Great Basin. For example, after forming about 32,000 years ago, Lake Bonneville overflowed about 14,500 years ago in the Bonneville Flood through Red Rock Pass and lowered to the &quot;Provo Lake&quot; level (the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, Rush Lake, and Little Salt Lake remain). Lake Lahontan, Lake Manly, and Lake Mojave were similar Pleistocene lakes.

==Geography==
===Great Basin physiographic section===
The Great Basin physiographic section of the Basin and Range Province contains the Great Basin, but extends into eastern Oregon, southern Idaho, and the Colorado River watershed and the northwest corner of Arizona). The Basin and Range region is the product of geological forces stretching the Earth&#x27;s crust, creating many north–south trending mountain ranges. These ranges are separated by flat valleys or basins. These hundreds of ranges make Nevada the most mountainous state in the country.

===Settlements and roads===
The Great Basin&#x27;s two most populous metropolitan areas are the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area to the west and the Wasatch Front to the east (with the latter being significantly more populous than the former). The region between these two areas is sparsely populated, but includes the smaller cities of Elko, Ely, Wendover, West Wendover, and Winnemucca. To the north are; in California Susanville, in Oregon Burns and Hines, in Idaho Malad and in Wyoming Evanston. To the south are Cedar City, Tonopah, and Bishop and the very southern area of the basin has the communities of Pahrump, Palmdale, Victorville, and Palm Springs. Interstate Highways traversing the Great Basin are Interstate 80 (I-80) and I-15, and I-70 and I-84 have their respective endpoints within its boundaries. Other major roadways are U.S. Route 6 (US 6), US 50, US 93, US 95 and US 395. The section of US 50 between Delta, Utah, and Fallon, Nevada, is nicknamed &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot;, and Nevada State Route 375 is designated the &quot;Extraterrestrial Highway&quot;. The Great Basin is traversed by several rail lines including the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad) through Reno and Ogden, Feather River Route, Central Corridor and Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad.

==History==
=== Indigenous populations ===
There has been a succession of indigenous peoples of the Great Basin. Paleo-Indian habitation by the Great Basin tribes began as early as 10,000 B.C. . Archaeological evidence of habitation sites along the shore of Lake Lahontan date from the end of the ice age when its shoreline was approximately higher along the sides of the surrounding mountains. The Paleo-Indians were mainly hunters and hunted bison, the extinct mammoth, and extinct ground sloth. For housing, since they followed the animals they were hunting, they had no permanent villages.

The next group to live in the area was the Great Basin Desert Archaic, from approximately 9,000 to 1,500 years ago. They hunted animals like mule deer and antelope and gathered onions, wild rye, and pinyon pine nuts. Then, from 1,500 to 700 years ago, the Fremont lived in the area. Unlike the Paleo-Indians, who moved around to follow bison herds, the Fremont built small villages and grew crops like corn and squash. 

Seven hundred years ago, the Shoshone inhabited the area after the Fremont. They were hunter-gathers and lived in temporary homes to be able to follow animal herds and collect plants. Now, Shoshone descendants live in nearby areas. Other tribes in the area included the Ute, Mono, and Northern Paiute. All of the tribes speak a language in the Numic language group.

To close a 1951 Indian Claims Commission case, the Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act of 2004 established the United States payment of $117 million to the Great Basin tribe for the acquisition of .

===Europeans===
European exploration of the Great Basin occurred during the 18th century Spanish colonization of the Americas. The first immigrant American to cross the Great Basin from the Sierra Nevada was Jedediah Strong Smith in 1827. Peter Skene Ogden of the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company explored the Great Salt Lake and Humboldt River regions in the late 1820s, following the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada to the Gulf of California. Benjamin Bonneville explored the northeast portion during an 1832 expedition. The United States had acquired claims to the territory north of the 42nd parallel via the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain and 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain. The US gained claims to most of the rest of the Great Basin via the 1848 Mexican Cession. The first non-indigenous settlement was in 1847 in the Great Salt Lake Valley, leading to the first American religious settlement effort of the Mormon provisional State of Deseret in 1849 in present-day Utah and northern Nevada. Later settlements were connected with the eastern regions of the 1848 California Gold Rush, with its immigrants crossing the Great Basin on the California Trail along Nevada&#x27;s Humboldt River to Carson Pass in the Sierras. The Oregon Territory was established in 1848 and the Utah Territory in 1850.

In 1869 the First transcontinental railroad was completed at Promontory Summit in the Great Basin. Around 1902, the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad was constructed in the lower basin and Mojave Desert for California-Nevada rail service to Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Climate==

The climate varies throughout the Great Basin by elevation, latitude, and other factors. Higher elevations tend to be cooler and receive more precipitation. The western areas of the basin tend to be drier than the eastern areas because of the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada. Most of the basin experiences a semi-arid or arid climate with warm summers and cold winters. However, some of the mountainous areas in the basin are high enough in elevation to experience an alpine climate.

<doc id="224928" wikidata="Q2983619" url="?curid=224928" title="Burns, Baby Burns">
<text>&quot;Burns, Baby Burns&quot; is the fourth episode of the eighth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 17, 1996. In the episode, Mr. Burns reunites with his long-lost son Larry. At first, they get along well, but Mr. Burns soon realizes that his son is an oaf. The episode was directed by Jim Reardon and is the first one written by Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode guest starred Rodney Dangerfield as Larry Burns.

==Plot==
After attending the annual Harvard–Yale football game, Mr. Burns and Waylon Smithers take a train back to Springfield. When the train makes an unexpected stop, a man named Larry approaches them selling souvenirs. Seeing Burns, he compares his face with an old photo and notes the resemblance. Suddenly, the train pulls away, leaving Larry behind. While on their way home from visiting a cider mill, the Simpsons see Larry hitchhiking and give him a ride. They take him to Burns&#x27; mansion where Larry reveals that he is the old man&#x27;s son.

After finding the birthmark that confirms that Larry is his son, Burns admits that Larry was the result of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame named Lily Bancroft at a college reunion. At first, he is overjoyed to have a son and treats him as his protégé. He takes him to fancy parties and tries to enroll him at Yale, but Larry&#x27;s oafish behavior embarrasses him. Larry starts working alongside Homer in Sector 7G at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and they become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner at the mansion. No longer able to contain his displeasure at Larry&#x27;s boorishness, Burns says that he wishes he had no son.

After Homer convinces Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns will admit that he loves his son, he moves into the Simpsons&#x27; basement. Homer tells Burns that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. Marge discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon it, but they are spotted by Kent Brockman&#x27;s news helicopter as they leave the house.

Homer and Larry run around town avoiding the police, being unsuccessful in looking for a place to hide. After managing to hide in the Aztec Theater, they unwittingly attract the attention of the police and media after Hans Moleman calls the police on them for harassing him. Homer and Larry climb atop the movie theater and have a brief standoff with the police.

Homer gives a heartfelt speech to justify Larry&#x27;s actions and Burns forgives them for the hoax, but explains he cannot be the family whom Larry needs. Larry understands and reveals he has a wife and children back home who are probably worried about him. After Burns and Larry say their goodbyes, a party spontaneously breaks out in front of the cinema at Larry&#x27;s incitement as the song &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; by Journey plays in the background.

==Production==

Ian Maxtone-Graham wrote the episode, and it was his first writing credit for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, although he had served as a consultant on the show for several months. Maxtone-Graham had previously worked with showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein on a game show and the two had wanted to hire him as a writer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The episode started out as a story about Mr. Burns and Grampa both being stationed in Paris during World War II and falling in love with the same woman, who had a love child. Maxtone-Graham had wanted this episode to be about Burns having a child, which is where it went. The other episode idea became &quot;Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &#x27;The Curse of the Flying Hellfish&#x27;, which aired in the previous season. The episode opens with the family visiting Mt. Swartzwelder Historic Cider Mill (a reference to fellow writer John Swartzwelder) because the writers had wanted to do something involving autumn and a cider mill seemed like a good setting for that.

Rodney Dangerfield guest stars in this episode and was a huge favorite of many of the show&#x27;s writers. Many of the jokes in the episode were specifically written to be &quot;Dangerfield jokes&quot;, which were much tougher to write than the staff had originally thought. Dangerfield made a few key changes to his script during the recording of his part; Weinstein kept the annotated script and pen and considers them among his three most prized &quot;The Simpsons&quot; possessions. Designing Larry Burns was a challenge because the director had wanted him to look like Dangerfield but still have Burns&#x27; characteristics such as the pointed nose.

==Cultural references==

The title of the episode references a line in the Trammps song &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; (&quot;Burn, baby, burn.&quot;) After discovering that Larry Burns is also working in Sector 7G, Homer frantically cleans up and puts away an almost entirely assembled jigsaw puzzle which has an image of Snoopy the dog lying on his doghouse. The puzzle is missing several pieces over where Snoopy&#x27;s nose should be, which was intentionally drawn that way to avoid infringing copyright laws.

The character from Yale that Mr. Burns briefly talks to is based on the fictional character Dink Stover from the book &quot;Dink Stover at Yale&quot; by Owen Johnson. The episode contains several references to the film &quot;Caddyshack&quot; in which Dangerfield stars, such as the scene where Larry tries to fit in with Mr. Burns&#x27; associates. The final street party, which features the song &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; by Journey (also featured in &quot;Caddyshack&quot;), also parodies the way that several films, including &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, end. The episode ends at a movie theater, which is a reference to several famous criminals who were involved with theatres, such as John Dillinger, Lee Harvey Oswald, and John Wilkes Booth.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Burns, Baby Burns&quot; finished 64th in ratings for the week of November 11–17, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 7.7, equivalent to approximately 7.5 million viewing households. It was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it &quot;[a] fun episode, with Rodney Dangerfield putting a lot of pathos into Larry – and Homer&#x27;s impassioned speech atop the cinema at the climax is one of his funniest moments.&quot;

<text>The String Quartet No. 6 in D minor, Sz. 114, BB 119, was the final string quartet that Béla Bartók wrote before his death in 1945.

The composition of the piece came at a very tumultuous time in the composer&#x27;s life. With the outbreak of World War II and his mother&#x27;s illness, Bartók returned to Budapest, where the quartet was finished in November. After his mother&#x27;s death, Bartók decided to leave with his family for the United States. Additionally, he began experiencing pain in his right shoulder, which have been speculated as being early signs of the blood disorder that would eventually take his life. Due to the war, communication between Bartók and Székely was difficult, and the quartet was not premiered until 20 January 1941, when the Kolisch Quartet, to whom the work is dedicated, gave its premiere at the Town Hall in New York City. The quartet represents a departure from his previous two quartets, with a four movement scheme rather than the five movements of the previous two. Each movement of the piece begins with a slow introduction, which contributes to the nostalgic tone of the piece.


== Background ==
The string quartet was begun in August 1939 in Saanen, Switzerland, where Bartók was a guest of his patron, the conductor Paul Sacher. Shortly after he completed the Divertimento for String Orchestra on the 17th, he started on a commission for his friend, the violinist Zoltán Székely. Székely was acting as intermediary for the New Hungarian Quartet, who had given the Budapest premiere of the String Quartet No. 5.

During the composition of the piece, the Second World War began. After Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria in 1938, it became difficult for Bartók to get his works published, and, by extension, to receive royalties from them. This led to the composer seeking a publishing contract with Boosey &amp; Hawkes. In addition to the state of the world being tumultuous so too was the composer&#x27;s life. In December 1939, after the completion of the quartet, Bartók learned of his mother&#x27;s death. Bartók then decided to leave with his family for the United States. Additionally, his own health began to fail. The early signs of a blood disorder began showing for which Bartók would undergo hydrotherapy. It can be seen from Bartók&#x27;s sketches that he had intended the last movement to have a quick, Romanian folk dance-like character with an &quot;aksak&quot; rhythmic character, but he abandoned this plan, whether motivated by pure compositional logic or despair at the impending death of his mother and the unfolding catastrophe of the war.

== Movements ==
The work is in four movements:

The String Quartet No. 6 does not feature the five movement arch form used in Bartók&#x27;s fourth and fifth string quartets. Each movement opens with a slow melody marked &quot;mesto&quot; (mournful). This material is employed for only a relatively short introduction in the first movement, but is longer in the second and longer again in the third. The introduction of the first movement is stated by the viola. It begins each movement of the quartet, but with variations in texture and harmony. Musicologists have suggested that the overall form of the piece resembles that of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. In the fourth movement, the &quot;mesto&quot; material, with reminiscences of the first movement material, consumes the entire movement.

=== Movement 1: Più mosso, pesante ===
This movement begins with a slow introduction by the viola alone marked &quot;Mesto.&quot; The movement derives its material from this slow introduction to make a sort of sonata allegro form in D minor. This structure may reflect the influence of Gustav Mahler, for it resembles the beginning of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Tenth Symphony with an introduction with a viola solo that is highly chromatic.

=== Movement 2: Marcia ===
This movement begins with a slow &quot;Mesto&quot; introduction as well. However, rather than the theme being presented by a single instrument (in the first movement&#x27;s case the viola), the theme is presented by all four members of the quartet. For this movement the theme is presented almost in a canonic form. This form permeates throughout the entirety of the movement, with instruments pairing off and playing similar gestures in the beginning of the movement. M. 35 of the movement is an example of this variation of texture and pairing, wherein Bartók pairs both violins together and the viola and cello together. The two violins play an ascending gesture, while the viola and cello play the same gesture inverted. Bartók would later go on to explore instrumental pairing on a much larger scale in his &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; which was premiered in 1944.

=== Movement 3: Burletta ===
The movement again begins with the &quot;Mesto&quot; theme, this time in a slightly thinner texture than in the previous movement with three of the members of the quartet. This version of the slow introduction also features canonic elements, like in m. 7. The viola enters in m. 10, providing a harmony of stacked thirds. It seems that Bartók uses similar devices in this movement as the previous. After the slow introduction, Bartók pairs different instruments off again, as seen in m. 26. The movement also features different pizzicato effects as well as quarter-tone slides in mm. 26-29, giving the movement a humorous slant.

In poor health and financially insecure, Bartók composed relatively little in the United States before his death in 1945, but, in the last year or so of his life, he made some sketches hypothesized to be the slow movement of a never completed seventh quartet.

=== Movement 4: Mesto ===
This movement is in contrast to the previous three movements in that the mesto theme that had previously been relegated to a slow introduction now permeates the entire movement. Thematic material form the first movement also returns. However, that material is stretched and extended in length. Bartók originally intended to have a fast fourth movement which was supposed to recall his piece &quot;Contrasts&quot; from the previous year.

== Reception/Aftermath ==
The quartet was published in 1941 by Boosey &amp; Hawkes. The quartet was premiered on January 20, 1941 in New York City. In the year before the premier, Bartók had permanently moved to the United States with his wife. After the composition of the quartet, a period of low productivity ensued for Bartók. Financially unstable and with the couple&#x27;s piano duet concerts receiving unfavorable reviews, Bartók began work in ethnomusicology in addition to concert tours in the United States. In the last year or so of his life, he made some sketches hypothesized to be the slow movement of a never completed seventh quartet.

<text>The String Quartet No. 4 in C major by Béla Bartók was written from July to September 1928 in Budapest. It is one of six string quartets by Bartok.

The work is dedicated to the Pro Arte Quartet but its first public performance was given by the Waldbauer-Kerpely Quartet in Budapest on 20 March 1929. It was first published in the same year by Universal Edition.

== Overview ==
The work is in five movements:

A study of the manuscript sources, as published by László Somfai finds that Bartók originally intended the quartet to have four movements, not five.

This work, like Bartók String Quartet No. 5, and several other pieces by Bartók, exhibits an arch form — the first movement is thematically related to the last, and the second to the fourth, with the third movement standing alone. Also, the outer four movements feature rhythmic sforzandos that cyclically tie them together in terms of climactic areas.

The quartet shares a similar harmonic language to that of the String Quartet No. 3, and as with that work, it has been suggested that Bartók was influenced in his writing by Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; (1926) which he had heard in 1927.

The quartet employs a number of extended instrumental techniques. For the whole of the second movement, all four instruments play with mutes, while the entire fourth movement features pizzicato. In the third movement, Bartók sometimes indicates held notes to be played without vibrato, and in various places he asks for glissandi (sliding from one note to another) and so-called &quot;Bartók&quot; or &quot;snap&quot; pizzicati, (a pizzicato where the string rebounds against the instrument&#x27;s fingerboard).

== Analysis ==

Bartók’s musical vocabulary, as demonstrated in his string quartets particularly, departs from traditional use of major and minor keys, focusing more on the chromatic scale and attempting to utilize each note equally. Regardless, Bartók doesn’t follow any form of serialism, instead dividing the chromatic scale into symmetrical units, with tonal centers being based on “axes of symmetry”. He also incorporates whole-tone, pentatonic, and octatonic scales — as well as diatonic and heptatonia seconda scales — as subsets of the chromatic scale.

His use of these subset scales allowed him to incorporate a wide range of folk music in an expanded harmonic system. Indeed, his original studies and settings of many examples gleaned from his extensive explorations of the Hungarian countryside and Eastern and Central Europe served as a major influence upon his expanded musical vocabulary.

Bartók held a long fascination with mathematics and how it pertained to music. He experimented with incorporating the golden section and the Fibonacci sequence into his writing. Though these fascinations aren’t obviously present in his Fourth String Quartet, Derek Locke has proposed that the quartet is structured using both the golden section and numbers from the Fibonacci series. He maintains that their use was &quot;not so much a matter of &#x27;aesthetic&#x27; proportions as a method for avoiding arbitrariness&#x27;.

Movements I and V share similar motifs; the second theme in the first movement is prominent in the fifth. Movements II and IV share similar ideas as well, but the ideas present within these two movements can be considered variations on themes presented earlier, expanding and building on ideas presented in the first and fifth movements. Movement III differs from the other four movements in that it is textured and quiet.

The symmetry of the movements isn’t limited only to the themes; the lengths of the movements show symmetry as well. The first, third and fifth movements are approximately six minutes long, whereas the second and fourth are shorter, at about three minutes each.

=== I. Allegro ===

Movement I utilizes whole-tone elements. Though not traditionally tonal, it is centered on ‘C’. The movement gradually progresses from cluster-like elements to full chords. This, in part, helps with building tension through the movement’s six minutes.

=== II. Prestissimo, con sordino ===

The second movement moves quicker than the first, giving off a hurried feeling. The chromatic scale is widely utilized, starting off in the lower registers and being answered in higher registers. Fast scales, trills, and vibrato are all used to add color and texture. The pentatonic scale is present and apparent throughout. Additionally, the strings are used to produce horn-like and percussive effects.

=== III. Non troppo lento ===

The third movement includes a great example of Bartók&#x27;s night music style. It completely departs from the first two movements in that it is more consonant, widely using diatonic and many folk-like elements. Usage of the pentatonic scale is more apparent.

=== IV. Allegretto pizzicato ===

The fourth movement is similar to the second and is faster than the previous, instilling the same hurry as in the first two movements. The musicians play pizzicato throughout. Bartók also utilizes Bartók pizzicato throughout the movement. Staying symmetrical, the music references and builds on ideas in movement II.

=== V. Allegro molto ===

The final movement mirrors the first, the second theme of the first movement seeing extensive use. The randomly accentuated quarter notes sound percussive and horn-like. Inversions and retrogrades of the theme are heard throughout the movement, utilized in different octaves. Overall, the fifth movement is more liberal in using variations of themes present in the first movement.

<text>The String Quartet No. 2 in A minor by Béla Bartók was written between 1915 and October 1917 in Rákoskeresztúr in Hungary. It is one of six string quartets by Bartok.
The work is in three movements:
In a letter to André Gertier, Bartók described the first movement as being in sonata form, the second as &quot;a kind of rondo&quot; and the third as &quot;difficult to define&quot; but possibly a sort of ternary form. Zoltán Kodály, who thought of the three movements of this quartet as &quot;life episodes,&quot; heard &quot;peaceful life&quot; in the first movement, and for all its roiling emotions, the movement does indeed leave an impression of tranquility at the end.

The brooding, intense last movement (Kodály heard it as &quot;suffering&quot;) is particularly funereal because it is as immobile as the second movement is animated. Long stretches are rhythmically static, and the parts that do move are often interrupted by silence.

The work was dedicated to the , who gave the piece its premiere on 3 March 1918 in Budapest. The work was first published in 1920 by Universal Edition.

<text>James Felix Bridger (March 17, 1804 – July 17, 1881) was an American mountain man, trapper, Army scout, and wilderness guide who explored and trapped in the Western United States in the first half of the 19th century. He was known as Old Gabe in his later years. He was from the Bridger family of Virginia, English settlers who had arrived in North America in the early colonial period.

Bridger was of the second generation of American mountain men and pathfinders who followed the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806. He participated in early expeditions into the west and mediated between Native American tribes and westward-migrating European-American settlers. By the end of his life, he had become the foremost explorer and frontiersmen in the American Old West. He had conversational knowledge of French, Spanish, and several indigenous languages; his photographic memory allowed him to map most of the Rocky Mountains from memory. 

He was described as &quot;at least six feet tall, straight as an Indian, muscular and quick in movement, but not nervous or excitable; in weight probably 160 pounds; with an eye piercing as the eye of an eagle that seemed to flash fire when narrating an experience.&quot; His strong constitution allowed him to survive the extreme conditions in the Rocky Mountains from Canadian border to what would become southern Colorado.

==Early life ==
James Felix Bridger was born on March 17, 1804, in Richmond, Virginia. His parents were James Bridger, an innkeeper in Richmond, and his wife, Chloe. About 1812, the family moved near St. Louis. At age 13, Bridger was orphaned; he had no formal education, was unable to read or write, and was apprenticed to a blacksmith. Despite eventually speaking at least seven languages, he remained illiterate. On March 20, 1822, at age 18, he left his apprenticeship, responding to an advertisement in St. Louis newspaper the &quot;Missouri Republican&quot;, and joined General William Henry Ashley&#x27;s fur trapping expedition to the upper Missouri River. The party included Jedediah Smith and many others who later became known as mountain men. 

== Career ==
In 1830, Bridger and several associates purchased a fur company from Smith and others, which they named the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. After dissolving that partnership, Bridger explored the continental interior between the Canada–U.S. border and the southern boundary of Colorado, and from the Missouri River westward to Idaho and Utah, either as a guide or a partner in the fur trade.

===Hugh Glass ordeal===

The bear attack and subsequent desertion of Hugh Glass occurred while Bridger was employed by Ashley at the time near the forks of the Grand River in present-day Perkins County, South Dakota. John Fitzgerald and a man known as &#x27;Bridges&#x27; stayed, waiting for him to die, as the rest of the party moved on. They began digging Glass&#x27;s grave. Claiming they were interrupted by an Arikara attack, the pair grabbed Glass&#x27;s rifle, knife, and other equipment and took flight. Bridges and Fitzgerald later caught up with the party and incorrectly reported to Ashley that Glass had died. No direct witness ties Bridger to the incident, and when asked by a historian later in his life, he denied involvement. 

===Yellowstone and the Great Salt Lake===
Bridger was among the first non-indigenous people to explore the Yellowstone region. In the fall of 1824, Bridger was the first person of European descent to explore the Great Salt Lake region, reaching it by bull boat. He was the first recorded non-indigenous person to explore Yellowstone&#x27;s springs and geysers. He shared that a creek south of Yellowstone Lake formed a Parting of the Waters, with one side going to the Pacific Ocean and the other side to the Atlantic Ocean. Bridger took a raft on the rapids at the Big Horn River; he was the only man known to have done this and lived.

=== Guide and adviser ===
In 1843, Bridger and Louis Vasquez established Fort Bridger on the Blacks Fork of the Green River along the Oregon Trail, in what is now Wyoming.

Bridger had explored, trapped, hunted, and blazed new trails in the West since 1822 and later worked as a wilderness guide. He could reportedly assess any wagon train or group, their interests in travel, and give them expert advice on heading West. 

In 1846, the Donner Party came to Fort Bridger and were assured by Bridger and Vasquez that Lansford Hastings&#x27; proposed shortcut ahead was &quot;a fine, level road, with plenty of water and grass, with the exception before stated (a forty-mile waterless stretch)&quot;. The 40-mile stretch was in fact 80 miles, and the &quot;fine level road&quot; slowed the Donner Party, who became trapped and died in the Sierra Nevada.

From 16 July 1857 until July 1858, Bridger was employed as a guide during the Utah War. In 1859, Bridger was the chief guide on the Yellowstone-bound Raynolds Expedition, led by Captain William F. Raynolds. Though deep snow prevented them from reaching Yellowstone, the expedition explored Jackson Hole and Pierre&#x27;s Hole. In 1861, Bridger was a guide for Edward L. Berthoud. From October 1863 until April 1864, Bridger was employed as a guide at Fort Laramie.

Bridger served as a scout under Colonel Henry B. Carrington during Red Cloud&#x27;s War. Bridger was stationed at Fort Phil Kearny during the Fetterman Fight, and the Wagon Box Fight. Bridger was discharged on 21 July 1868.

Suffering from goiter and rheumatism, Bridger returned to Missouri in 1868. He was unsuccessful in collecting back rent from the government for the lease on Fort Bridger. By 1875, he was blind.

==== Bridger Pass and the Bridger Trail ====

In 1850, while guiding the Stansbury Expedition on its return from Utah, Bridger discovered what became known as Bridger Pass, an alternate overland route that bypassed South Pass and shortened the Oregon Trail by 61 miles. Bridger Pass, in what became south-central Wyoming, later became the chosen route across the Continental Divide, for the Overland Stage, Pony Express, the Union Pacific Railroad Overland Route, and Interstate 80.

In 1864, Bridger blazed the Bridger Trail, an alternative route from Wyoming to the gold fields of Montana that avoided the dangerous Bozeman Trail. In 1865, he served as Chief of Scouts during the Powder River Expedition.

==Family and death==
In 1835, Bridger married a woman from the Flathead tribe, whom he named &quot;Emma&quot;, with whom he had three children. After she died in 1846 from fever, he married the daughter of a Shoshone chief, who died in childbirth three years later. In 1850, he married Shoshone Chief Washakie&#x27;s daughter Mary Washakie Bridger with whom he raised two children. Some of his children went back east to be educated. His firstborn Mary Ann was captured by a band of Cayuse during the Whitman Massacre and died soon after she was released. His son Felix, who fought with the Missouri Artillery, died of sickness on Bridger&#x27;s farm. His daughter Josephine, who married Jim Baker, also died, leaving his daughter Virginia as his only surviving child. In 1867, while in his early sixties, his eyesight began failing to the point where &quot;he could not shoot very good&quot;. By the early 1870s, he was living under Virginia&#x27;s care and could no longer recognize people unless they spoke. Jim Bridger was blind by 1875.

Bridger died on his farm near Kansas City, Missouri, on July 17, 1881, at age 77.

==Legacy==

Bridger is remembered as one of the most colorful and widely traveled mountain men. In addition to his explorations and his service as a guide and adviser, he was known for his storytelling. His stories about the geysers at Yellowstone, for example, proved to be accurate. Others were exaggerated and clearly intended to amuse: one of Bridger&#x27;s stories involved a petrified forest in which there were &quot;petrified birds&quot; singing &quot;petrified songs&quot; (though he may have seen the petrified trees in the Tower Junction area of what is now Yellowstone National Park). Over the years, Bridger became so associated with tall tales that many stories invented by others were attributed to him. Supposedly one of Bridger&#x27;s favorite yarns to weave to told of his pursuit by one hundred Cheyenne warriors. After he was chased for several miles, Bridger found himself at the end of a box canyon, with the Indians bearing down on him. At this point, Bridger fell silent, prompting his listener to ask, &quot;What happened then, Mr. Bridger?&quot; Bridger would then reply, &quot;They killed me.&quot;

<text>Anna Maria Jarvis (May 1, 1864 – November 24, 1948) was the founder of Mother&#x27;s Day in the United States. Her mother had frequently expressed a desire to establish such a holiday, and after her mother&#x27;s death, Jarvis led the movement for the commemoration. However, as the years passed, Jarvis grew disenchanted with the growing commercialization of the observation and even attempted to have Mother&#x27;s Day rescinded. By the early 1940s, she had become infirm, and was placed in a sanatorium by friends and associates where she died on November 24, 1948. A legend exists that a portion of her medical bills were paid for by florists.

==Family and early life==
Anna Maria Jarvis was born to Granville E. and Ann Maria (née Reeves) Jarvis on May 1, 1864, in Webster, Taylor County, West Virginia, the ninth of eleven children. Seven of her siblings died in infancy or early childhood. Her birthplace, today known as the Anna Jarvis House, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. The family moved to Grafton, West Virginia, also in Taylor County, later in her childhood.

Ann Reeves Jarvis was a social activist and founder of Mothers&#x27; Day Work Clubs. As a woman defined by her faith, she was very active within the Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church community. It was during one of her Sunday school lessons in 1876 that her daughter, Anna Jarvis, allegedly found her inspiration for Mother&#x27;s Day, as Ann closed her lesson with a prayer, stating:

With the encouragement of her mother, Anna Jarvis attended college. She was awarded a diploma for the completion of two years of coursework at the Augusta Female Seminary in Staunton, Virginia, today known as Mary Baldwin University. Jarvis returned to Grafton to work in the public school system, additionally joining her mother as an active church member, maintaining a close link to her mother.

After her uncle, Dr. James Edmund Reeves, persuaded her to move to Chattanooga, Tennessee, Jarvis worked there as a bank teller for a year. The following year, Jarvis again moved, this time to live with her brother in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, despite her mother&#x27;s urging to return to Grafton. Jarvis was successful in Philadelphia, taking a position at Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company, where she became the agency&#x27;s first female literary and advertising editor. Another accomplishment was becoming a shareholder in the Quaker City Cab Company, her brother&#x27;s business.

While away from Grafton, Anna Jarvis maintained close correspondence with her mother. Ann Reeves Jarvis was proud of her daughter&#x27;s achievements, and the letters kept mother and daughter closely linked. After the death of Jarvis&#x27; father, Granville, in 1902, she urged her mother to move to Philadelphia to stay with her and her brother. Both brother and sister worried about their mother&#x27;s health, and Ann Reeves Jarvis ultimately agreed to move to Philadelphia in 1904 when her heart problems necessitated it. Jarvis spent most of her time caring for her mother as Ann Reeves Jarvis&#x27; health declined. She died on May 9, 1905.

==Movement towards Mother&#x27;s Day==
On May 10, 1908, three years after her mother&#x27;s death, Jarvis held a memorial ceremony to honor her mother and all mothers at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church, today the International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine, in Grafton, West Virginia, marking the first official observance of Mother&#x27;s Day. The International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine has been a designated National Historic Landmark since October 5, 1992.

Although Jarvis did not attend this service, she sent a telegram describing the significance of the day and five hundred white carnations for all who attended the service. As she spoke in Philadelphia at the Wanamaker&#x27;s Store Auditorium, she moved her audience with the power of her speech.

==Commercialization, conflict, and later life==
Although the national proclamation represented a public validation of her efforts, Jarvis always believed herself to be the leader of the commemorative day. She, therefore, maintained her established belief in the sentimental significance of the day to honor all mothers and motherhood. Jarvis valued the symbolism of such tangible items as the white carnation emblem, which she described as: 

Jarvis frequently referred to her mother&#x27;s memory during her efforts to maintain the sentimental heart of the day while also maintaining her role as the founder of the holiday. In addition to her efforts to maintain her position and recognition as the holiday&#x27;s founder, Jarvis struggled against forces of commercialization that overwhelmed her original message. Among some of these forces were the confection, floral, and greeting card industries. The symbols she valued for their sentimentality, such as the white carnation, easily became commodified and commercialized.

By the 1920s, as the floral industry continued increasing prices of white carnations and then introduced red carnations to meet the demand for the flower, Anna Jarvis&#x27; original symbols began to become re-appropriated, such as the red carnation representing living mothers and the white carnation honoring deceased mothers. She attempted to counter these commercial forces, creating a badge with a Mother&#x27;s Day emblem as a less ephemeral alternative to the white carnation. 

However, her efforts to hold on to the day&#x27;s original meaning led to her own economic hardship. While others profited from the day, Jarvis did not, and she spent the later years of her life with her sister Lillie. In 1943, she began organizing a petition to rescind Mother&#x27;s Day. However, these efforts were halted when she was placed in the Marshall Square Sanitarium in West Chester, Pennsylvania. People connected with the floral and greeting card industries paid the bills to keep her in the sanitarium.

Jarvis died on November 24, 1948, and was buried next to her mother, sister, and brother at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Although the Anna M. Jarvis Committee supported her and helped to continue her movement during her declining health, it ultimately disbanded with the assurance that the Jarvis family gravesite would remain under the care of her grandniece who was the only heir to the estate, her second oldest brother&#x27;s granddaughter, as she never married or had any children.

<doc id="224962" wikidata="Q3748473" url="?curid=224962" title="Fort Bridger">
<text>Fort Bridger was originally a 19th-century fur trading outpost established in 1842, on Blacks Fork of the Green River, in what is now Uinta County, Wyoming, United States. It became a vital resupply point for wagon trains on the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails. The US Army established a military post here in 1858 during the Utah War, until it was finally closed in 1890. A small town, Fort Bridger, Wyoming, remains near the fort and takes its name from it.

==Bridger&#x27;s trading post==
The post was established by the mountain man Jim Bridger, after whom it is named, and Louis Vasquez. In December 1843, Bridger wrote to Pierre Chouteau Jr., &quot;I have established a small fort, with a blacksmith shop and a supply of iron in the road of emigrants on Black Fork of Green River, which promises fairly.&quot; According to Stanley Vestal, &quot;His fort consisted simply of an eight-foot stockade, with a corral adjoining on the north. Within that stockade stood four log cabins with flat dirt roofs. One of these housed Bridger&#x27;s forge and carpenter&#x27;s bench, another his store, the third his family and possibles, while the fourth was the home of his partner.&quot; On October 19, 1852, Mrs. Benjamin G. Ferris visited with her husband, and described the fort as &quot;- a long, low, strongly-constructed log building, surrounded by a high wall of logs, stuck endwise in the ground.&quot; On March 9, 1854, Bridger filed a claim with the United States General Land Office, for the around the fort.

Richard Francis Burton visited the fort in August 1860, and later wrote, &quot;Colonel Bridger, when an Indian trader, placed this post upon a kind of neutral ground between the Snakes and the Crows (Hapsaroke) on the north, the Oglalas and other Sioux to the east, the Arapahoes and Cheyennes on the south, and various tribes of Yutas (Utahs) on the southwest.&quot; Bridger, perhaps the most picturesque figure in early Wyoming, was often called the &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; of the Rockies. Bridger Pass was also named for him.

In 1845, Lansford Hastings published a guide entitled &quot;The Emigrant&#x27;s Guide to Oregon and California&quot;, which advised California emigrants to leave the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger, pass through the Wasatch Range across the Great Salt Lake Desert (an 80-mile waterless drive), loop around the Ruby Mountains, and rejoin the California Trail about seven miles west of modern Elko, Nevada (now Emigrant Pass). The ill-fated Donner-Reed Party followed that route, along which they were met by a rider sent by Hastings to deliver letters to traveling emigrants. On July 12, the Donners and Reeds were given one of these letters, in which among other messages, Hastings claimed to have &quot;worked out a new and better road to California&quot;, and said he would be waiting at Fort Bridger to guide the emigrants along the new cutoff.

==Mormons and Fort Supply==
On July 7, 1847, Orson Pratt was amongst the first party of Mormons to arrive at the fort. He described the fort as, &quot;Bridger&#x27;s post consists of two adjoining log houses, dirt roofs, and a small picket yard of logs set in the ground, and about eight feet high.&quot; Nine native lodges were located nearby.

With the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in 1847, disputes arose between Bridger and the new settlers. By 1853, a militia of Mormons was sent to arrest him for selling alcohol and firearms to the Native Americans, a violation of Federal Law. He escaped capture and temporarily returned to the East. Near the existing fort, the Mormons established their own Fort Supply the same year. In 1855, Mormons took over Fort Bridger, reportedly having bought it for $8,000 in gold coins. The Mormons claimed, over Bridger&#x27;s denials, they had purchased the fort from Vasquez. There was a deed dated August 3, 1855, recorded October 21, 1858, in Salt Lake City in Records Book B. p. 128, that ostensibly sold Fort Bridger to the LDS Church. Bridger and Vasquez&#x27;s names were signed by H. F. Morrell in the presence of Alinerin Grow and William Adams Hickman, purportedly pursuant to a power of attorney. Bridger was absent from the area in 1855, acting as guide for Sir St George Gore.

Andrew Jenson noted, &quot;From 1853 to 1857, Fort Bridger was quite an important &#x27;Mormon&#x27; outpost.&quot; Orson Hyde arrived at the fort on November 13, 1853, with 39 Mormon settlers. They established Fort Supply on Willow Creek, about southwest of Fort Bridger. Jenson goes on to state, &quot;Fort Bridger and Fort Supply were deserted by the &#x27;Mormons&#x27; in September, 1857, on the approach of Col. Johnston&#x27;s army.&quot;

==Military post==
On November 18, 1857, Bridger leased his surveyed land to the United States, though payment was withheld until Bridger could establish title. Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston was to use the land for his army during the Utah War. Relations had deteriorated between Mormon leaders in Utah Territory and federal authorities in Washington, D.C. President James Buchanan ordered the United States Army to install a new governor, Alfred Cumming to replace Brigham Young. As the army of 2,500 advanced in November 1857, the Mormons set fire to the Fort Bridger buildings. Johnston kept his supplies, with a garrison, within the stone walls which remained, while the army wintered at Camp Scott nearby. In June 1858, as the majority of Johnston&#x27;s Army set off for Salt Lake City, two companies of troops remained behind. The other troops continued on and eventually established Camp Floyd south of Salt Lake City.

Major William Hoffman commanded the army depot of Fort Bridger from 7 June 1858, until 17 August, when he was relieved by Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Edward Canby. Elements of the Sixth and Tenth Infantry, and First Cavalry, erected storehouses and troop quarters. On July 14, 1859, orders established a military reservation at Fort Bridger amounting to . Major Richard C. Gatlin took over command on 7 March 1860. Captain Alfred Cumming took command on 4 June 1860, followed by Captain Franklin Gardner on 7 August 1860. Captain Jesse Gove commanded from 29 May 1861 until 9 August, when the number of troops was reduced due to demands of the American Civil War. Captain M. G. Lewis took over command in December 1862, followed by Major Noyes Baldwin in 1865. Captain Anson Mills assumed command from November 1866 until August 1867.

In 1858, William A. Carter was appointed as post sutler at Fort Bridger. Perhaps more than any other individual, the history of the post revolves around this civilian merchant who remained at the center of the post&#x27;s activities for his lifetime. When William A. Carter died in November 1881, his wife, Mary Elizabeth Hamilton Carter, became sutler, then renamed as the post trader until 1890. Judge Carter was a probate judge who had served in the army during the Seminole Wars. He managed both his sutler&#x27;s store, and the post office, under one roof.

Chief Washakie signed the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868 at the fort on 3 July, which ceded the Shoshone and Bannock lands in southwestern Wyoming, and created the Wind River Indian Reservation.

Lieutenant Colonel Henry Morrow was in command from 9 November 1867 until 17 April 1869. During this time, Fort Bridger troops helped guard construction of the Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad) and the Overland Stage and Mail route. In the summer of 1870, Yale College Professor Othniel Charles Marsh used the fort as a base camp during a geological expedition. The fort was also host to the geological survey conducted by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden from 12 September to 1 October 1870. Ultimately, the expansion of the railroads in the west made this and other forts obsolete. Fort Bridger was first abandoned in 1878 but then was re-established two years later. The Army closed the post in 1890 when Wyoming became a state.

==Preservation==
The historical Fort Bridger has several interesting old buildings still standing: the old Pony Express barn and the Mormon protective wall.

On June 27, 1928, the site of the fort, and remaining buildings, were sold to the Historical Landmark Commission of Wyoming. Dedication ceremonies were held on June 25, 1933 establishing Fort Bridger as a Wyoming Historical Landmark and Museum. The Annual Fort Bridger Muzzle Loading Rendezvous is held every Labor Day weekend.

<text>Webster is an unincorporated community in Taylor County, West Virginia. It lies four miles south of Grafton. Its elevation is 1,019 feet above sea level.

== History ==
Webster became a junction on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1854. Webster was the location of a Union encampment during the American Civil War. It was the birthplace of Anna Marie Jarvis, the founder of Mother&#x27;s Day as a national holiday in the United States. Her birthplace, known as the Anna Jarvis House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

The village of Webster should not be confused with Webster County, West Virginia or its county seat, Webster Springs.

<doc id="224973" wikidata="Q921045" url="?curid=224973" title="John Wanamaker">
<text>John Wanamaker (July 11, 1838December 12, 1922) was an American merchant and religious, civic and political figure, considered by some to be a proponent of advertising and a &quot;pioneer in marketing&quot;. He served as United States Postmaster General in the Benjamin Harrison administration from 1889 to 1893.

==Early life and education==
Wanamaker was born in the Grays Ferry section of South Philadelphia on July 11, 1838. to John Nelson Wanamaker, a brickmaker and native of Kingwood, New Jersey, and Elizabeth Deshong Kochersperger, daughter of a farmer and innkeeper in Gray&#x27;s Ferry.

His mother&#x27;s ancestors came from Rittershoffen in Alsace, France, and from Canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==Career==
At the age of 19, Wanamaker was hired by the Philadelphia YMCA, and served as the first corresponding secretary in the YMCA national organization.

===Department store business===


In 1861, Wanamaker opened his first store in partnership with his brother in-law Nathan Brown. The store, called &quot;Oak Hall&quot;, was located at 6th and Market Streets in Philadelphia, adjacent to the site of the residence and offices of George Washington during his presidency.

Oak Hall grew substantially based on Wanamaker&#x27;s then-revolutionary principle: &quot;One price and goods returnable&quot;.

In 1869, he opened his second store at 818 Chestnut Street, and, capitalizing on his own name due to the untimely death of his brother-in-law and growing reputation, renamed the company John Wanamaker &amp; Co. In 1875, he purchased an abandoned railroad depot and converted it into a large store, called John Wanamaker &amp; Co. &quot;The Grand Depot&quot;. &quot;Wanamaker&#x27;s&quot; is considered the first department store in Philadelphia.

====Wanamaker Building====
The Wanamaker Building is a large, 12-story granite store in Philadelphia, designed by Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham and completed in 1910. It was dedicated by U.S. President William Howard Taft on December 30, 1911. The store stands on the site of &quot;The Grand Depot&quot;, encompassing an entire block at the corner of 13th and Market Streets across from Philadelphia City Hall. The new store, The Wanamaker Building, which still stands today, became a Philadelphia institution. The entire building was initially devoted to the department store and company offices.

The building has remained an integral part of Philadelphia culture. In 2018, the upper office tower was marketed as the Wanamaker Office Building.

==== Grand Court ====
The Wanamaker Building&#x27;s most notable feature is its seven-story, marble-clad central atrium, known as the &quot;Grand Court&quot;. The Grand Court quickly became a Philadelphia favorite, highlighted by the Wanamaker Eagle and the Wanamaker Grand Court Organ.

The Grand Court has been featured in several movies, including &quot;Nasty Habits&quot; in 1977, &quot;Mannequin&quot; in 1987, &quot;Blow Out&quot; in 1981, and &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; in 1995.

==== Wanamaker Organ ====
The Wanamaker Grand Court Organ was designed by George Ashdown Audsley and built by the Los Angeles Art Organ Company for the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. The instrument had 10,059 pipes, and cost $105,000 to construct, equal to $ today. Wanamaker bought the organ in 1909 and had it transported from St. Louis aboard 13 freight cars. The organ&#x27;s installation in Philadelphia took two years. It was played for the first time on June 22, 1911, to coincide with England&#x27;s King George V&#x27;s coronation.

More than 8,000 pipes were added to the organ between 1911 and 1917. By 1930, an additional 10,000 pipes were installed, bringing the total number of pipes today to 28,750. The instrument is of the American Symphonic school of design, intended to combine traditional organ resources with the tone colors and beauty of the symphony orchestra. Once a year, usually in June, &quot;Wanamaker Organ Day&quot; is held. This free festival lasts most of the day.

==== Wanamaker Eagle ====
John Wanamaker purchased a bronze bird sculpture by August Gaul, following the sculpture&#x27;s exhibition in America in 1904 at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The sculpture is a focal point of the store&#x27;s Grand Court. The sculpture is placed above a steel beam because of its weight. Known as the &quot;Wanamaker Eagle&quot;, it became a famous meeting place and &quot;Meet me at the Eagle&quot; became a popular Philadelphia catchphrase.

==== Christmas Light Show ====
In November 1955, the store tapped lighting designer, Frederick Yost, to create seasonal displays. Yost designed the &quot;Holiday Light Show&quot; for the Grand Court, creating a more-contemporary display than previous years. Since then, the light show has become an annual tradition for generations of Philadelphians. In the 21st century, the light show has been modernized, but has retained the look and feel of the original. Since 2006, the &quot;Macy&#x27;s Dickens Village&quot; has been located on the store&#x27;s third floor, continuing a Christmas tradition that had begun at Strawbridge&#x27;s in 1985.

====Expansion====
Wanamaker expanded to New York City in 1896, continuing a mercantile business originally started by Alexander Turney Stewart. He expanded internationally with the Wanamaker European import houses in London and Paris.

Wanamaker was an innovator, creative in his work, a merchandising genius, and proponent of the power of advertising, though modest and with an enduring reputation for honesty. Although he did not invent the fixed price system, he is credited for the creation of the price tag; he popularized it as the industry standard. He also started the &quot;money-back guarantee&quot; that is now standard business practice.

He provided his employees with free medical care, education, recreational facilities, pensions and profit-sharing plans before such benefits were considered standard. Labor activists, however, knew him as a fierce opponent of unionization. During an 1887 organizing drive by the Knights of Labor, he fired the first twelve union members who were discovered by his detectives.

Wanamaker was the first retailer to place a half-page newspaper ad (1874) and the first full-page ad (1879). He initially wrote his own ad copy, but later hired the world&#x27;s first full-time copywriter John Emory Powers. During Powers&#x27;s tenure, Wanamaker&#x27;s revenues doubled from $4 million to $8 million. Wanamaker supposedly said &quot;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don&#x27;t know which half.&quot;

==Postmaster General==
In 1889, Wanamaker began the First Penny Savings Bank in order to encourage thrift. The same year, he was appointed United States Postmaster General by President Benjamin Harrison; he was accused by the newspapers of the day of buying the post. Wanamaker was credited by his friends with introducing the first commemorative stamp and many efficiencies to the Postal Service. He was the first to make plans for free rural postal service in the United States, although the plan was not implemented until 1896.

In 1890, Wanamaker persuaded Congress to pass an act prohibiting the sale of lottery tickets through the mail, and then he aggressively pursued violators. Those actions effectively ended all state lotteries in the US until they reappeared in 1964, partly as an effort to undermine organized crime.

Wanamaker&#x27;s tenure at the Post Office was riddled with controversy. He fired some 30,000 postal workers under the then common &quot;spoils system&quot; during his four-year term, as it was customary for a change in political administrations to lead to new appointments for their own supporters. The changeover of so many employees caused severe confusion, inefficiency, and a run-in with civil-service crusader Theodore Roosevelt, a fellow Republican.

In 1890, Wanamaker commissioned a series of stamps that were derided in the national media as the poorest quality stamps ever issued, both for printing quality and materials. When his department store ordered advance copies of the newly translated novel &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; by Leo Tolstoy, the deadline was missed, and only the regular discount was offered by the publisher. He retaliated by banning the book from the US Mail on grounds of obscenity.

He was ridiculed for this action by many major U.S. newspapers. In 1891, he ordered changes in the uniforms of letter carriers, and was accused of arranging for all the uniforms to be ordered from a single firm in Baltimore, to which he was believed to have financial ties. In 1893 he made a public prediction at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair that U.S. mail would still rely on stagecoach and horseback delivery for a century to come, failing to anticipate the effects of trains, the automobile, and related truck vehicles.

During World War I, Wanamaker publicly proposed that the United States buy Belgium from Germany for the sum of one-hundred billion dollars, as an alternative to the continuing carnage of the war.

Wanamaker was a presidential elector in the 1888 and 1920 presidential elections.

Wanamaker was the last surviving member of President Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s cabinet.

== Philanthropy ==
Wanamaker was known for his philanthropy to programs to aid the poor in Philadelphia. He co-founded Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter and soup kitchen, in 1878. The Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission has since expanded to provide more services and still supports the homeless population of Philadelphia.

He was an avid collector of art and antiquities. He made several donations to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

Among the donations was a collection of bronze reproductions of artifacts uncovered from the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, known as the Wanamaker Bronzes, which Wanamaker had commissioned by the Chiurazzi Foundry in Naples for the museum.

==Personal life==
In 1860, Wanamaker married Mary Erringer Brown.

They had six children, two of whom died in childhood:
* Thomas Brown Wanamaker (1862–1908), who married Mary Lowber Welch (1864–1929)
* Lewis Rodman Wanamaker (1863–1928), who married Fernanda de Henry and Violet Cruger
* Horace Wanamaker (born 1864), died in infancy during the American Civil War
* Harriett E. &quot;Nettie&quot; Wanamaker (1865–1870)
* Mary Brown &quot;Minnie&quot; Wanamaker (1869–1954), who married Barclay Harding Warburton
* Elizabeth &quot;Lillie&quot; Wanamaker (1876–1927), who married Norman McLeod

In 1899, Wanamaker&#x27;s son, Thomas, who specialized in store financial matters, purchased &quot;The North American&quot;, a Philadelphia-based newspaper. He irritated his father by publishing regular columns to radical intellectuals, including Henry George, Jr., socialist Henry John Nelson, who later became Emma Goldman&#x27;s lawyer, and socialist Caroline H. Pemberton. The younger Wanamaker also began publishing a Sunday edition, which offended his father&#x27;s sense of keeping the Sabbath holy.

His younger son Rodman, a Princeton University graduate, lived in France early in his career. He is credited with creating a demand for French luxury goods in Philadelphia and the United States that persists to this day. Rodman was credited with the artistic quality that gave the Wanamaker stores their cachet. He was also a patron of fine music, organizing spectacular organ and orchestra concerts in the Wanamaker Philadelphia and New York City stores under music director Alexander Russell.

==Death==

Wanamaker died on December 12, 1922. His funeral was on December 14, 1922, with a service at the Bethany Presbyterian Church. He was interred in the Wanamaker family tomb in the churchyard of the Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.

At his death, his estate was estimated to be US$100 million ($ today), divided equally among his three living children and granddaughters, Mary &quot;Minnie&quot; Wanamaker Warburton (Mrs. Barclay Warburton), Patricia &quot;Paddy&quot; W. Estelle, and Elizabeth Wanamaker McLeod, who all received substantial stock, real estate and cash instruments. Second son Rodman was made sole inheritor of the store businesses.

Rodman Wanamaker died in 1928, leaving the businesses with a documented worth of $36.7 million ($ today) in a trust. Rodman is credited with founding the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America and the Millrose Games.

The senior Wanamaker&#x27;s first son, Thomas B. Wanamaker, died in Paris in 1908.

==Legacy==

His country estate, Lindenhurst mansion in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, was located on York Road below Washington Lane at (). The original mansion was designed by architect E. A. Sargent of New York City; President Harrison visited Wanamaker at the Lindenhurst mansion.

A neoclassic mansion was constructed when the original Victorian Lindenhurst burned in 1907, destroying much of Wanamaker&#x27;s art collection. A railroad station, Chelten Hills located below Jenkintown, and no longer in existence, was constructed on the property in addition to his vast mansion. Part of the former estate became the campus of Salus University.

A family trust owned the Wanamaker&#x27;s store chain, run by a trustee system set up by Rodman Wanamaker&#x27;s will. In 1978, the business was sold to Carter Hawley Hale, Inc. The 15-store chain was sold to Woodward &amp; Lothrop in 1986, and the downtown store was renamed as Lord &amp; Taylor. Woodies declared bankruptcy in 1994, and with it went the Wanamaker stores, which were sold to May Department Stores Company on June 21, 1995. In August 2006 the flagship Philadelphia store was converted from a Lord &amp; Taylor to a Macy&#x27;s.

* Bronze busts honoring Wanamaker and other industry magnates stand between the Chicago River and the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago, Illinois.
* A popular saying illustrating how difficult it was to quantify the response to advertising is attributed to Wanamaker: &quot;Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don&#x27;t know which half.&quot;
* Beginning in 1908, Wanamaker financed Anna Jarvis&#x27;s campaign to have a national Mother&#x27;s Day holiday officially recognized. On May 8, 1914, the U.S. Congress passed a law designating the second Sunday in May as Mother&#x27;s Day, which also later became an international holiday. A dedicated Pennsylvania historic marker honoring Jarvis and Wanamaker is located at Philadelphia City Hall, across the street from Wanamaker&#x27;s store, where the earliest Mother&#x27;s Day ceremonies were held.
* Wanamaker&#x27;s fame was considerable around the world in his heyday. In the original play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1912) by George Bernard Shaw, Alfred Doolittle is left a legacy by an American philanthropist millionaire named &quot;Ezra Wanafeller&quot;, combining Wanamaker&#x27;s name with John D. Rockefeller, Sr.
* Wanamaker owned homes in Philadelphia, Cape May Point and Bay Head in New Jersey, New York City, Florida, London, Paris, and Biarritz. He had a townhouse at 2032 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, which was designed similar to an English manor house and held a Welte Philharmonic Organ. He died in this residence. The facade of this building is still extant. During the 1980 construction of the new Wanamaker House high rise on the adjacent property on Walnut Street, the facade of the original Wanamaker house was closely monitored to ensure its preservation. This monitoring was performed by the Engineering firm, Boucher and James, Inc. Dale Leonard, professional land surveyor. Thomas Edison, a close friend, was an honorary pallbearer at his funeral (there were 150 of them).
* Wanamaker was instrumental in the foundation of the Williamson College of the Trades (originally, &#x27;Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades&#x27;) in Elwyn, PA. It was named for his friend and mentor, Isaiah Vansant Williamson. Williamson died in 1889, shortly after he founded the school. Wanamaker was the chairman of the school&#x27;s first board of trustees, who realized Williamson&#x27;s vision and planning for the school. The board held a competition for the design of the original campus buildings and selected famed Philadelphia architect, Frank Furness (&quot;Furness, Evans &amp; Company&quot;). Wanamaker has been memorialized in many ways at the school, most conspicuously in The John Wanamaker Free School of Artisans, which encompasses the instructional trade workshops and is considered the heart of the college. A dormitory, foundations, and groups are also named in his honor. Wanamaker privately wrote a biography of Williamson titled, &quot;Life of Isaiah V. Williamson,&quot; which was published posthumously in 1928.
* Wanamaker was a Pennsylvania Mason. &quot;The John Wanamaker Masonic Humanitarian Medal&quot; was created by resolution of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania at the December Quarterly Communication of 1993. The medal, also called &quot;The Wanamaker Medal&quot; is to be awarded to a person (male or female) who, being a non-Mason, supports the ideals and philosophy of the Masonic Fraternity. At the discretion of the R. W. Grand Master, the medal is awarded to &quot;one who personifies the high ideals of John Wanamaker–a public spirited citizen, a lover of all people, and devoted to doing good&quot;. The medal has been presented sparingly to maintain the great prestige associated with an award created by resolution of the Pennsylvania Grand Lodge.
* Wanamaker was instrumental in the vision and planning of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia.

<text>The term built environment refers to human-made conditions and is often used in architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, public health, sociology, and anthropology, among others. These curated spaces provide the setting for human activity and were created to fulfill human desires and needs. The term can refer to a plethora of components including the traditionally associated buildings, cities, public infrastructure, transportation, open space, as well as more conceptual components like farmlands, dammed rivers, wildlife management, and even domesticated animals. 
The built environment is made up of physical features. However, when studied, the built environment often highlights the connection between physical space and social consequences. It impacts the environment and how society physically maneuvers and functions, as well as less tangible aspects of society such as socioeconomic inequity and health. Various aspects of the built environment contribute to scholarship on housing and segregation, physical activity, food access, climate change, and environmental racism.

== Features ==
There are multiple different components that make up the built environment. Below are some prominent examples of what makes up the urban fabric:

=== Buildings ===
Buildings are used for a multitude of purposes: residential, commercial, community, institutional, and governmental. Building interiors are often designed to mediate external factors and provide space to conduct activities, whether that is to sleep, eat, work, etc. The structure of the building helps define the space around it, giving form to how individuals move through the space around the building.

=== Public infrastructure ===
Public infrastructure covers a variety of things like roads, highways, pedestrian circulation, public transportation, and parks.

Roads and highways are an important feature of the built environment that enable vehicles to access a wide range of urban and non urban spaces. They are often compared to the arteries and veins of a cardiovascular system insofar as they circulate people and materials throughout a city similar to how arteries and veins circulate molecules like oxygen, glucose, and hormones between the heart and the cells, which is required for cell survival and optimal functioning. . Pedestrian circulation is vital for the walkability of a city and general access on a human scale. The quality of sidewalks and walkways have an impact on safety and accessibility for those using these spaces. Public transportation is essential in urban areas, particularly in cities and areas that have a diverse population and income range.

=== Agriculture ===
Agricultural production accounts for roughly 52% of U.S. land use. Not only does population growth cause an expansion of cities, it also necessitates more agriculture to accommodate the demand for food for an expanding population.

==History==

&quot;Built environment&quot; as a term was coined in the 1980s, becoming widespread in the 1990s and places the concept in direct contrast to the supposedly &quot;unbuilt&quot; environment. The term describes a wide range of fields that form an interdisciplinary concept that has been accepted as an idea since classical antiquity and potentially before. Through the study of anthropology, the progression of the built environment into what it is today has been able to be examined. When people are able to travel outside of urban centers and areas where the built environment is already prominent, it pushes the boundaries of said built environment into new areas. While there are other factors that influence the built environment, like advancements in architecture or agriculture, transportation allowed for the spread and expansion of the built environment.

=== Pre–industrial Revolution ===
Agriculture, the cultivation of soil to grow crops and animals to provide food as well as products, was first developed about 12,000 years ago. This switch, also called the Neolithic Revolution, was the beginning of favoring permanent settlements and altering the land to grow crops and farm animals. This can be thought of as the start of the built environment, the first attempt to make permanent changes to the surrounding environment for human needs. The first appearance of cities was around 7500 BCE, dotted along where land was fertile and good for agricultural use. In these early communities, a priority was to ensure basic needs were being met. The built environment, while not as extensive as it is today, was beginning to be cultivated with the implementation of buildings, paths, farm land, domestication of animals and plants, etc. Over the next several thousand years, these smaller cities and villages grew into larger ones where trade, culture, education, and economics were driving factors. As cities began to grow, they needed to accommodate more people, as well as shifted from focusing on meeting survival needs to prioritizing comfort and desires – there are still many individuals today who do not have their basic needs met and this idea of a shift is within the framework of the evolution of society. This shift caused the built aspect of these cities to grow and expand to meet the growing population needs.

=== Industrial Revolution ===

The pinnacle of city growth was during the Industrial Revolution due to the demand for jobs created by the rise in factories. Cities rapidly grew from the 1880s to the early 1900s within the United States. This demand led individuals to move from farms to cities which resulted in the need to expand city infrastructure and created a boom in population size. This rapid growth in population in cities led to issues of noise, sanitation, health problems, traffic jams, pollution, compact living quarters, etc. In response to these issues, mass transit, trolleys, cable cars, and subways, were built and prioritized in an effort to improve the quality of the built environment. An example of this during the industrial revolution was the City Beautiful movement. The City Beautiful movement emerged in the 1890s as a result of the disorder and unhealthy living conditions within industrial cities. The movement promoted improved circulation, civic centers, better sanitation, and public spaces. With these improvements, the goal was to improve the quality of life for those living in them, as well as make them more profitable. The City Beautiful movement, while declined in popularity over the years, provided a range of urban reforms. The movement highlighted city planning, civic education, public transportation, and municipal housekeeping.

=== Post Industrial Revolution to present ===
The invention of cars, as well as train usage, became more accessible to the general masses due to the advancements in the steel, chemicals, and fuel generated production. In the 1920s, cars became more accessible to the general public due to Henry Ford&#x27;s advances in the assembly line production. With this new burst of personal transportation, new infrastructure was built to accommodate. Freeways were first built in 1956 to attempt to eliminate unsafe roads, traffic jams, and insufficient routes. The creation of freeways and interstate transportation systems opened up the possibility and ease of transportation outside a person&#x27;s city. This allowed ease of travel not previously found and changed the fabric of the built environment. New streets were being built within cities to accommodate cars as they became increasingly popular, railway lines were being built to connect areas not previously connected, for both public transportation as well as goods transportation. With these changes, the scope of a city began to expand outside its borders. The widespread use of cars and public transportation allowed for the implementation of suburbs; the working individual was able to commute long distances to work everyday. Suburbs blurred the line of city &quot;borders&quot;, the day-to-day life that may have originally been relegated to a pedestrian radius now encompassed a wide range of distances due to the use of cars and public transportation. This increased accessibility allowed for the continued expansion of the built environment.

Currently, the built environment is typically used to describe the interdisciplinary field that encompasses the design, construction, management, and use of human-made physical influence as an interrelated whole. The concept also includes the relationship of these elements of the built environment with human activities over time—rather than a particular element in isolation or at a single moment in time, these aspects act together via the multiplier effect. The field today draws upon areas such as economics, law, public policy, sociology, anthropology, public health, management, geography, design, engineering, technology, and environmental sustainability to create a large umbrella that is the built environment.

There are some in modern academia who look at the built environment as all-encompassing, that there is no natural environment left. This argument comes from the idea that the built environment not only refers to that which is built, arranged, or curated, but also to what is managed, controlled, or allowed to continue. What is referred to as &quot;nature&quot; today can be seen as only a commodity that is placed into an environment that is constructed to fulfill the human will and desire. This commodity allows humans to enjoy the view and experience of nature without it inconveniencing their day-to-day life. It can be argued that the forests and wild-life parks that are held on a pedestal and are seemingly natural are in reality curated and allowed to exist for the enjoyment of the human experience. The planet has been irrevocably changed by human interaction. Wildlife has been hunted, harvested, brought to the brink of extinction, modified to fit human needs, the list goes on. This argument juxtaposes the argument that the built environment is only what is built, that the forests, oceans, wildlife, and other aspects of nature are their own entity.

== Impact ==
The term built environment encompasses a broad range of categories, all of which have potential impacts. When looking at these potential impacts, the environment, as well as people, are heavily affected.

=== Health ===
The built environment can heavily impact the public&#x27;s health. Historically, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding within cities and urban environments have led to infectious diseases and other health threats. Dating back to Georges-Eugene Haussmann&#x27;s comprehensive plans for urban Paris in the 1850s, concern for lack of air-flow and sanitary living conditions has inspired many strong city planning efforts. During the 19th century in particular, the connection between the built environment and public health became more apparent as life expectancy decreased and diseases, as well as epidemics, increased. Today, the built environment can expose individuals to pollutants or toxins that cause chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes, and coronary vascular disease, along with many others. There is evidence to suggest that chronic disease can be reduced through healthy behaviors like a proper active lifestyle, good nutrition, and reduced exposure to toxins and pollutants. Yet, the built environment is not always designed to facilitate those healthy behaviors. Many urban environments, in particular suburbs, are automobile reliant, making it difficult or unreasonable to walk or bike to places. This condition not only adds to pollution, but can also make it hard to maintain a proper active lifestyle. Public health research has expanded the list of concerns associated with the built environment to include healthy food access, community gardens, mental health, physical health, walkability, and cycling mobility. Designing areas of cities with good public health is linked to creating opportunities for physical activity, community involvement, and equal opportunity within the built environment. Urban forms that encourage physical activity and provide adequate public resources for involvement and upward mobility are proven to have far healthier populations than those that discourage such uses of the built environment.

=== Social ===

==== Housing and segregation ====
Features in the built environment present physical barriers which constitute the boundaries between neighborhoods. Roads and railways, for instance, play a large role in how people can feasibly navigate their environment. This can result in the isolation of certain communities from various resources and from each other. The placement of roads, highways, and sidewalks also determines what access people have to jobs and childcare close to home, especially in areas where most people do not own vehicles. Walkability directly influences community, so the way a neighborhood is built affects the outcomes and opportunities of the community that lives there. Even less physically imposing features, such as architectural design, can distinguish the boundaries between communities and decrease movement across neighborhood lines.

The segregation of communities is significant because the qualities of any given space directly impact the wellbeing of the people who live and work there. George Galster and Patrick Sharkey refer to this variation in geographic context as &quot;spatial opportunity structure&quot;, and claim that the built environment influences socioeconomic outcomes and general welfare. For instance, the history of redlining and housing segregation means that there is less green space in many Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Access to parks and green space has been proven to be good for mental health which puts these communities at a disadvantage. The historical segregation has contributed to environmental injustice, as these neighborhoods suffer from hotter summers since urban asphalt absorbs more heat than trees and grass. The effects of spatial segregation initiatives in the built environment, such as redlining in the 1930s and 1940s, are long lasting. The inability to feasibly move from forcibly economically depressed areas into more prosperous ones creates fiscal disadvantages that are passed down generationally. With proper public education access tied to the economic prosperity of a neighborhood, many formerly redlined areas continue to lack educational opportunities for residents and, thus, job and higher-income opportunities are limited.

The built environment has a multitude of impacts on the planet, some of the most prominent effects are greenhouse gas emissions and Urban Heat Island Effect.

The built environment expands along with factors like population and consumption which directly impact the output of greenhouse gases. As cities and urban areas grow, the need for transportation and structures grows as well. In 2006, transportation accounted for 28% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Building&#x27;s design, location, orientation, and construction process heavily influence greenhouse gas emissions. Commercial, industrial, and residential buildings account for roughly 43% of U.S. emissions in energy usage. In 2005, agricultural land use accounted for 10–12% of total human-caused greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

Urban heat islands are pockets of higher temperature areas, typically within cities, that effect the environment, as well as quality of life. Urban Heat Islands are caused by reduction of natural landscape in favor of urban materials like asphalt, concrete, brick, etc. This change from natural landscape to urban materials is the epitome of the built environment and its expansion.

<text>Peter &quot;Possum&quot; Raymond George Bourne (13 April 1956 – 30 April 2003) was a champion New Zealand rally car driver. He died under non-competitive circumstances while driving on a public road that was to be the track for an upcoming race.

== Awards ==

He was a three-time winner of the Asia-Pacific Rally Championship and the Australian Rally Championship seven times consecutively, amongst many other titles. In 1993 he became the first New Zealand resident to have a works contract in a FISA rally championship, when he drove a Subaru Legacy for Prodrive.

== Family ==
Bourne lived in Pukekohe, Auckland, near his workshop. He lived with his wife, Peggy Bourne, and three children, Taylor, Spencer, and Jazlin. Bourne earned his nickname, &quot;Possum&quot;, on the night he crashed his mother&#x27;s Humber 80 while trying to avoid a possum in the middle of the road.

His autobiography, &quot;Bourne to Rally&quot;, was completed just days before his death. A bronze memorial statue of Bourne, unveiled a year after his death, stood overlooking the place of his death. The statue was moved to Pukekohe town square in April 2013, unveiled alongside the 2013 ITM 400 V8 Championship parade. In 2005, Peggy Bourne entered Race to the Sky, despite having had no formal rally driving experience, as a tribute to her late husband. In 2013, his oldest son Taylor Bourne competed in the 2013 Possum Bourne Memorial Rally with his stepfather and MP Mark Mitchell as co-driver. When Taylor completed the event, he went on to say &quot;It&#x27;s easy to understand why he loved it so much&quot;.

== Car of choice ==
Bourne was best known for his exploits behind the wheel of Subaru cars, initially the RX (the turbocharged version of the Leone), then the Legacy (rebadged as the Liberty for the Australian market because of a perceived clash with charity organisation Legacy Australia).

But it would be the Impreza WRX that he would become most associated with, driving for the Subaru World Rally Team in Rally New Zealand, Australia and also in Indonesia, partnered by Richard Burns in the mid 1990s, before going on to win multiple Australian titles with Subaru Rally Team Australia.

Subaru Japan gave him a black, limited edition Subaru Impreza WRX STi for personal use.

== Death of Rodger Freeth ==

Bourne&#x27;s best friend and co-driver, Dr. Rodger &quot;Roj&quot; Freeth, died in a horrible accident during 1993 Rally Australia, and the crash almost ended Bourne&#x27;s career. After encouragement from the Freeth family, he returned to the driver&#x27;s seat. After Freeth&#x27;s death, Bourne displayed a &quot;ROJ&quot; license plate on the front of his rally cars.

== Death ==

Bourne received serious head injuries in a non-competitive car crash on 18 April 2003, and died in Dunedin Hospital on 30 April 2003 after life support was withdrawn. He was driving the Race to the Sky track, on the Waiorau Snow Farm Road which is normally a public road, for the event held in Cardrona, near Wānaka, New Zealand. Driving his Subaru Forester, he collided head on with a Jeep Cherokee driven by rally driver Mike Barltrop who claimed that Bourne was speeding. This treacherous road has over 100 corners and at least 15 hairpins, hence its appeal for rally driving. Barltrop was later arrested on a dangerous driving charge. After pleading guilty to aggravated careless use causing death, Barltrop was sentenced in the Invercargill District Court to 300 hours&#x27; community work, disqualified from driving for 18 months, and ordered to pay $10,000 reparations, divided between the intensive care unit of Dunedin Public Hospital and the Possum Bourne Education Trust.

At the time of his death, Bourne had just re-entered the world stage, driving a production-class Subaru Impreza in the PWRC.

<text>Cyrus Reed Teed (October 18, 1839 – December 22, 1908) was a U.S. eclectic physician and alchemist turned pseudoscientific religious leader and self-proclaimed messiah. In 1869, claiming divine inspiration, Teed took on the name [[Cyrus|Koresh]] and proposed a new set of scientific and religious ideas which he called Koreshanity, including the belief in the existence of a concave, or &quot;cellular&quot;, Hollow Earth cosmology positing that the sky, humanity, and the surface of the Earth exist on the inside of a universe-encompassing sphere.

In New York in the 1870s, he founded the Koreshan Unity, a commune whose rule of conduct was based on his teachings. Other similar communities were established in Chicago and San Francisco. After 1894, the group concentrated itself in the small Florida town of Estero, seeking to build a &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; in that locale, peaking at 250 residents during the first decade of the 20th century. Following Teed&#x27;s death late in 1908 the group went into decline, finally disappearing in 1961, leaving the Koreshan State Historic Site behind.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Teed was born October 18, 1839, in Trout Creek, New York, to Sarah and Jesse Teed. Cyrus grew up in Utica, New York, and, after leaving school at age 11, went to work on the Erie Canal as a driver of the animals that pulled the boats along. Cyrus was a distant relative of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.

Teed studied medicine before opening a medical practice in Utica, New York.

===Koreshanity===

As a young eclectic physician, Teed was always interested in unconventional experiments, such as alchemy, often involving dangerously high levels of electricity. In the autumn of 1869, during an experiment he was badly shocked, and passed out. During his period of unconsciousness, Teed believed he was visited by a divine spirit who told him that he was the messiah. Inspired, once he awoke Teed vowed to apply his scientific knowledge to &quot;redeem humanity.&quot; He promptly changed his first name to &quot;Koresh,&quot; the Hebrew version of &quot;Cyrus&quot;.

Teed denounced the idea that the Earth revolved around the Sun and instead pioneered his own theory of the Universe, known as the Cellular Cosmogony. According to this theory, human beings live on the inside of the planet, not the outside; also, the sun is a giant battery-operated contraption, and the stars mere refractions of its light.

Teed&#x27;s ideas, called Koreshanity, caught on with others. Koreshanity preached cellular cosmogony, alchemy, reincarnation, immortality, celibacy, communism, and a number of other radical ideas. Teed started preaching Koreshanity in the 1870s in New York, forming the Koreshan Unity, later moving to Chicago.

===Communal leader===

One of Teed&#x27;s fundamental principles involved the gathering of his most devoted followers into communal living groups. A first commune was formed in Chicago in 1888. By 1902 a second Koreshan community was established in that city. Other followers of the so-called Koreshan Unity formed a short-lived community in San Francisco, which lasted from 1891 to 1892. Small church groups existed in other towns.

In 1894 Teed&#x27;s followers began to congregate in a small Florida town called Estero, where Teed planned to form a &quot;New Jerusalem.&quot; The two Chicago societies, including the group&#x27;s printing plant, were subsequently shut down and moved to Florida. The colony was extensively landscaped and bedecked with numerous exotic tropical plants. The Koreshans built extensively, establishing a bakery, general store, concrete works, power plant, and &quot;World College of Life&quot; in the community. They also published their newspaper from the site, called &quot;The Flaming Sword.&quot;

The &quot;golden age&quot; of the Koreshan Unity in Estero was 1903 to 1908, when they had over 250 residents and incorporated the town, its territory embracing some 110 square miles — the fifth largest area of any city in the United States at the time.

They tried to run several candidates for county government against the local Democratic Party, but were never successful.

===Death and legacy===

On October 13, 1906, while meeting the 1:30 pm Atlantic Coast Line train from Baltimore, a group of Koreshans got into a fight in front of R. W. Gillams&#x27; grocery store in Ft. Myers, Teed tried to break it up and he was severely beaten by a Marshal Sanchez, suffering injuries from which he never recovered. He died on December 22, 1908.

Teed&#x27;s followers initially expected his resurrection, after which he and his faithful would be taken up to heaven as he had predicted in his book &quot;The Immortal Manhood.&quot; They kept a constant vigil over his body for two days, after which time it began to show signs of decay. Following Christmas the county health officer stepped in to order his burial. After his death the group went into decline.

The last remaining follower, Hedwig Michel, deeded what remained of the colony, some 350 acres of land, to the State of Florida in 1961. Following Michel&#x27;s death in 1982, the site became known as the Koreshan State Historic Site.

Cyrus Teed&#x27;s son, Douglas Arthur Teed, was an American Impressionist painter, but not a follower of his father&#x27;s teachings.

<doc id="225017" wikidata="Q1618825" url="?curid=225017" title="Hillside Strangler">
<text>The Hillside Strangler (later the Hillside Stranglers) is the media epithet for an American serial killer—later discovered to be a duo, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono—who terrorized the women of Los Angeles between October 1977 and February 1978, during a time when Southern California was plagued by several active serial killers. The nickname originates from the pattern of many of the victims&#x27; bodies being discovered in the hills surrounding the city, typically victims of strangulation.

An unusual twist in the investigation was the arrival in California of a psychic from Berlin; Detective Bob Grogan was politely unenthusiastic when the medium wrote, in German, that the police should be looking for two male Italians who were (possibly) brothers, aged about 35. This assessment proved to be—at least partially—correct, when the Hillside Stranglers were eventually found to be New York state natives Angelo Buono, Jr. (b. 1934; aged 43 in 1977), and his adoptive nephew Kenneth Bianchi (b. 1951; aged 26 in 1977), with the former being of Italian American ancestry. 

Initially, it was believed that only one person was responsible for the killings, as investigators had no reason to believe otherwise. However, judging from the positions of some of the victims&#x27; bodies, it was deduced that two criminals were working together, though police withheld that information from the press. After an elderly neighbor of one of the victims witnessed and reported her kidnapping (having heard the words &quot;You won&#x27;t get away with this&quot;), police had their confirmation that two individuals were involved. The uncle-nephew duo were eventually apprehended and convicted of kidnapping, raping, torturing and murdering 10 females together, plus two by Bianchi alone, ranging in age from 12 to 28.

The Hillside Strangler murders began with the deaths of two prostitutes, who were found strangled and dumped naked on hillsides northeast of Los Angeles in October and early November 1977. It was not until the deaths of five more young women—who were not sex workers—, from middle-class neighborhoods, that the media attention and subsequent &quot;Hillside Strangler&quot; moniker came to prominence.

There were two more deaths in December and February before the murders abruptly stopped. An extensive investigation proved fruitless, until the arrest of Bianchi in January 1979 for the murder of two young women in Washington state, and the subsequent linking of his past to the Strangler case. Ironically, Bianchi had tried, and failed, several times to become a police officer himself, but was denied each time. Nevertheless, he remained cordial and even developed a brief &quot;friendship&quot; with some of the officers at the Los Angeles Police Department, being invited to several social gatherings and going on patrols with some of them. It was reported that during these patrol drives, Bianchi, allegedly, would discuss and inquire about the killings, likely to see what the LAPD knew. It was this history of applying to the LAPD, and his California state ID, that clued-in law enforcement to Bianchi, who had been attempting to hide-out in Washington.

The most expensive trial in the history of the California legal system at that time followed, with Bianchi and Buono eventually being found guilty of those crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Background==

In January 1976, Kenneth Bianchi left Rochester, New York, and moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his adoptive cousin Angelo Buono Jr. Buono provided a seemingly strong role model for the docile Bianchi, who was impressed by the older man&#x27;s ability to &quot;sweet-talk&quot; the women he met. When Bianchi was short on money, Buono came up with the idea of getting some girls to work for them as prostitutes. Two teenage runaways, Sabra Hannan and Becky Spears, met Bianchi and Buono, and, once under their control, were forced to prostitute themselves. When the girls were not with clients, they were sexually and physically assaulted and mentally manipulated by Bianchi and Buono themselves. One day, Spears went to go see a client at his home, who happened to be a prominent LA lawyer, David Wood. She eventually would tell him all the details of their harrowing situation, leaving the man appalled and arranging for her to escape to a safe house.

Encouraged by Spears&#x27; escape, Hannan ran away from Bianchi and Buono a short time later, but was soon brought back and assaulted again, being forced to &quot;pay&quot; twice as intensely for her own &quot;wrongdoings&quot;, and for Spears&#x27; disappearance. Eventually, however, Hannah escaped. With their pimping income gone, the duo decided to find more teenage girls. Impersonating police officers, using fake police badges, they eventually found another young woman and installed her in the previous girl&#x27;s bedroom. Additionally, they purchased a supposed &quot;trick-list&quot; from a prostitute named Deborah Noble containing the names and contacts of men who frequently sought prostitutes. Figuring that these men could be potential new clients, Noble and a friend, Yolanda Washington, delivered the list to Buono in October 1977.

==Murders==

===Yolanda Washington===
Yolanda Washington was a 19 year old prostitute. She always worked on a certain stretch of Sunset Boulevard; her naked body was found on October 18, 1977, on a hillside near the Ventura Freeway. Detectives determined that the corpse was cleaned before being dumped, while faint marks were also visible around the neck, wrists and ankles, signs of a rope being used. The victim had been assaulted, raped and strangled.

===Judith Miller===
On November 1, 1977, police were called to Alta Terrace Drive in La Crescenta, a neighborhood 12 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, where the body of a teenage girl was found naked, face up on a parkway in a middle-class residential area. The homeowner had covered her with a tarp in the early morning hours to prevent the neighborhood children from viewing her on their way to school. Ligature marks were on her neck, wrists and ankles, indicating to police she was bound and strangled. The body had been dumped, indicating she was killed elsewhere.

Detective Salerno also found a small piece of light-colored fluff on her eyelid and saved it for the forensic experts. A coroner&#x27;s report further detailed that she had been raped and sodomized. The girl, who was described as being &quot;small and thin, weighing about 90 pounds and appearing to be about 16 years old&quot;, was eventually identified as 15-year-old Judith Lynn Miller, a former student of Hollywood High School. After dropping out, Miller was a runaway and small-time sex worker.

Miller was last seen alive on Halloween, October 31, 1977, talking to a man driving a large, two-toned sedan on Sunset Boulevard next to Carney&#x27;s. The stranglers had told her they were ‘undercover’ police officers, handcuffed her, and took her to Buono&#x27;s Auto Upholstery Shop at 703 E. Colorado St. in Glendale, where she was murdered.

===Lissa Kastin===
Five days later, on November 6, 1977, the nude body of another woman was discovered near the Chevy Chase Country Club in Glendale. Like Miller before, her body bore five-point (neck, wrists, and ankles) ligature marks and showed signs of having been strangled and brutally raped—but not sodomized, allegedly due to her having hair present on her legs. The woman was then identified as 21-year-old waitress Elissa Teresa &quot;Lissa&quot; Kastin, who was last seen leaving the restaurant where she worked the night before her body was discovered.

In addition to working full-time, Kastin was also a professional dancer in an all-female dance and cabaret troupe, The L.A. Knockers. Unlike the previous two victims, Kastin was not a sex worker, drug-user or runaway. The stranglers followed Kastin after she was seen driving home from work, pulled her over on the street she lived on, presented a &quot;police badge&quot;, and told her that they were &quot;detectives&quot;. They then handcuffed her and told her they needed to take her in for &quot;questioning&quot;.

===Aborted abduction of Catharine Lorre Baker===
At some point in early November 1977, the two men approached 24-year-old Catharine Lorre Baker, the daughter of actor Peter Lorre—famous for his role as a serial killer in Fritz Lang&#x27;s film &quot;M&quot;—with the intent of abducting and killing her. However, when Lorre produced not only her driver&#x27;s license when requested, but also a picture of her sitting on her father&#x27;s lap as a child, the two let her go without incident, fearing the murder of a celebrity&#x27;s child would attract an unusually high amount of police and press attention.

Lorre did not realize who the men were until they were arrested, at which point she recalled that two men flashing L.A. police badges had approached her in the past.
===Dolores Cepeda and Sonja Johnson===
On Sunday, November 13, 1977, two girls, 12-year-old Dolores Ann &quot;Dolly&quot; Cepeda and 14-year-old Sonja Marie Johnson, boarded an RTD bus in front of the Eagle Rock Plaza on Colorado Boulevard and headed home. The last time they were seen was getting off the bus on York Boulevard and North Avenue 46, and approaching a two-tone sedan that reportedly had two men inside. Their two corpses were discovered by a 9-year-old boy who was treasure-hunting in a trash heap on a hillside near Dodger Stadium on November 20, 1977. Both of the girls&#x27; bodies had already begun to decompose. It was determined that they had been strangled and raped.

===Kristina Weckler===
Earlier that same day, November 20, 1977, hikers found the naked body of 20-year-old Kristina Weckler, a quiet, unassuming honors student at the Art Center College of Design, described by Detective Bob Grogan of the Los Angeles Police Department as a &quot;…loving and serious young woman who should have had a bright future ahead of her&quot;. Weckler was discovered on a hillside between Glendale and Eagle Rock. When found by Detective Grogan, the typical ligature marks were on her wrists, ankles, and neck, and when he turned her over, bruises were observed on her breasts and blood oozed from her rectum. Unlike the first three victims, there were two puncture marks on her arm, but no signs of the needle tracks that indicated a drug addict; it was later determined that Weckler had been injected with Windex, a common ammonia-based window, glass and hard-surface cleaner.

===Evelyn Jane King===
On November 23, 1977, the badly decomposed body of 28-year-old Evelyn Jane King, an aspiring actress who had gone missing on November 9, was discovered in bushes near the Los Feliz Boulevard off-ramp of the Golden State Freeway. The severity of decomposition prevented determination as to whether she had been raped or tortured, but she had been strangled like the others. In response authorities created a task force—initially composed of 30 officers from the LAPD, the Sheriff&#x27;s Department and the Glendale Police Department—to catch the predatornow dubbed the &quot;Hillside Strangler&quot;.
===Lauren Wagner===
On November 29, 1977, police found the body of 18-year-old Lauren Rae Wagner, a business student who lived with her parents in the San Fernando Valley, in the hills around Los Angeles&#x27;s Mount Washington. She had ligature marks on her neck, ankles, and wrists. There were also burn marks on her hands indicating she was tortured. Lauren&#x27;s parents had expected her to come home before midnight, and the next morning, when they found her car parked across the street with the door ajar, her father questioned the neighbors.

He found that the woman who lived in the house where Lauren&#x27;s car had been parked saw her abduction. This woman stated that she saw two men: one was tall and young, the other one was older and shorter with bushy hair. She also stated that she heard Wagner cry out &quot;You won&#x27;t get away with this!&quot; during her abduction.

===Kimberly Martin===
On December 14, 1977, the naked body of 17-year-old prostitute Kimberly Diane Martin, which also showed signs of torture, was found on a deserted lot near Los Angeles City Hall. Martin had previously joined a call girl agency because she feared exposing herself on the streets with the Strangler on the loose. The killers happened to place a call to her agency from a Hollywood Public Library pay phone, and she was the call girl who was dispatched. When the police investigated the apartment she had been dispatched to, they found it vacant and broken into.

===Cindy Hudspeth===
The body of the final Hillside Strangler victim was discovered in Los Angeles on February 17, 1978, when a helicopter pilot spotted an orange Datsun abandoned midway down a cliff on the Angeles Crest Highway. Police responded to the scene and discovered the nude body of the car&#x27;s owner, 20-year-old Cindy Lee Hudspeth—a student and part-time waitress—in the trunk. Her corpse again showed ligature marks, and she had been raped and tortured. She had been strangled and her body placed in the trunk of her car, which was then pushed off the cliff.

Hudspeth&#x27;s murder had initially been unplanned. Bianchi had arrived at Buono&#x27;s upholstery shop at closing time on February 16 to discover Hudspeth in the company of Buono, discussing upholstery work she wished him to perform on her car. The two men had a private discussion, opting to make her their next victim.

==Investigation and trial==
In January 1979, after an intense investigation, police charged Bianchi and Buono with the crimes. Bianchi had fled to Bellingham, Washington, where he was soon arrested by the Bellingham Police Department for raping and murdering two women he had lured to a home for a house-sitting job. Bianchi attempted to set up an insanity defense, claiming that he had dissociative identity disorder and that a personality separate from himself committed the murders. Court psychologists, notably Dr. Martin Orne, observed Bianchi and found that he was faking. Ultimately, Bianchi agreed to plead guilty and testify against Buono in exchange for leniency.

At the conclusion of Buono&#x27;s trial in 1983, Presiding Judge Ronald M. George, who later became Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, stated during sentencing, &quot;I would not have the slightest reluctance to impose the death penalty in this case were it within my power to do so. Ironically, although these two defendants utilized almost every form of legalized execution against their victims, the defendants have escaped any form of capital punishment.&quot; Bianchi is serving a life sentence at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Buono died of a heart attack on September 21, 2002, at Calipatria State Prison in California, where he was serving a life sentence.

==Veronica Compton==

In 1980, Bianchi began a relationship with Veronica Compton. During his trial, she testified for the defense. While incarcerated, Bianchi had smuggled a semen filled condom to her in the spine of a book, so she could use it to stage a rape/murder committed by the Hillside Strangler. She was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to strangle a woman she had lured to a motel in an attempt to have authorities believe that the Hillside Strangler was still on the loose and the wrong man was imprisoned. She was released in 2003.

<text>Eightball is a comic book by Daniel Clowes and published by Fantagraphics Books. It ran from 1989 to 2004. The first issue appeared soon after the end of Clowes&#x27;s previous comic book, &quot;Lloyd Llewellyn&quot;. &quot;Eightball&quot; has been among the best-selling series in alternative comics.

Early issues of &quot;Eightball&quot; feature a mixture of very short, often crudely humorous comics (&quot;Zubrick and Pogeybait&quot;, &quot;The Sensual Santa&quot;), topical rants and satires (&quot;Art School Confidential&quot;, &quot;On Sports&quot;), longer, more reflective self-contained stories (&quot;Caricature&quot;, &quot;Immortal Invisible&quot;), and serialized works. The first extended story serialized in &quot;Eightball&quot; was &quot;Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron&quot;, which ran in issues #1–10. &quot;Glove&quot; was followed by &quot;Ghost World&quot; (issues #11–18). Beginning with #19 each issue of &quot;Eightball&quot; has been devoted to a single storyline, as opposed to the more eclectic format of the earlier issues. Issues #19–21 serialized the graphic novel &quot;David Boring&quot;, while issues #22 and 23 each consisted of a collection of short, fragmentary stories in diverse styles and formats that meshed into a unified narrative (&quot;Ice Haven&quot; and &quot;The Death Ray&quot;). The issues of &quot;Eightball&quot; beginning with #19 have been published in full color in a larger magazine-sized format. &quot;Eightball&quot; #18 included a bound-in copy of Clowes&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Modern Cartoonist&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
&quot;Ghost World&quot; was adapted by Clowes and director Terry Zwigoff into a 2001 feature film of the same name, for which Clowes and Zwigoff were nominated for an Academy Award for screenplay writing. Additionally, the 2006 Clowes/Zwigoff film &quot;Art School Confidential&quot; was loosely based on a short story of the same name which appeared in &quot;Eightball&quot; #7. 

==Controversy==
The comic generated controversy when a high school teacher in Guilford, Connecticut gave &quot;Eightball&quot; #22 (&quot;Ice Haven&quot;) to a student as a make-up summer reading assignment. The parents of the student had concerns about the book&#x27;s appropriateness. The superintendent of Guilford High School said the book was inappropriate for 13-year-olds and placed the teacher on leave. The teacher resigned before the matter was fully investigated. The Guilford school district and principal were criticized for getting police involved and trying the issue in a &quot;kangaroo court&quot;.

<doc id="225024" wikidata="Q787020" url="?curid=225024" title="Speech from the throne">
<text>A speech from the throne, or throne speech, is an event in certain monarchies in which the reigning sovereign, or their representative, reads a prepared speech to members of the nation&#x27;s legislature when a session is opened. The address sets forth the government&#x27;s priorities for its legislative agenda, for which the cooperation of the legislature is sought. The speech is often accompanied by formal ceremony. It is often held annually, although in some places it may occur more or less frequently, whenever a new session of the legislature is opened.

Historically, when monarchs exercised personal influence and overall decision-making in government, a speech from the throne would outline the policies and objectives of the monarch; the speech was usually prepared by the monarch&#x27;s advisers, but the monarch supervised the drafting of the speech at least to some extent and exercised final discretion as to its content. In modern constitutional monarchies, whether by law or by convention, the head of state or their representative reads the speech from the throne, but it is prepared by the ministers in cabinet.

Of contemporary European monarchies today, this traditional event is held in the United Kingdom, where it is also known as the King&#x27;s Speech (or Queen&#x27;s Speech if the reigning monarch is female); the Netherlands, on Prince&#x27;s Day; and Norway. In other countries the monarch may or may not attend the opening of the country&#x27;s legislature; they may also give a speech, but these speeches, in contrast, do not outline any government agenda.

Many republics have adopted a similar practice in which the head of state, often a president, addresses the legislature; in the United States, the president makes an annual State of the Union address, in the Philippines the president makes an annual State of the Nation Address. In parliamentary republics where the president is merely a ceremonial figurehead, these speeches are often similar in tone to the throne speech of a constitutional monarchy, whereas in presidential systems such as the U.S. the speeches are somewhat different in that the president exercises personal discretion over the content but the principle of separation of powers means the legislature is not obligated to follow whatever agenda (if any) may be contained in such a speech.

==Commonwealth realms==
===Terminology===
In the United Kingdom, the speech is known as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Most Gracious Speech&quot;, the &quot;Gracious Address&quot;, or, less formally, the &quot;King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (or &quot;Queen&#x27;s Speech&quot;, when the reigning monarch is female). In Canada, it is known as the &quot;Speech from the Throne&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Throne Speech&quot;) (in French: &quot;Discours du Trône&quot;). Since 1973, the lieutenant governor of Quebec has delivered a short inaugural address termed the &quot;Allocution&quot;, after which the premier reads his or her &quot;Discours d&#x27;ouverture&quot; (Opening Speech), called the &quot;Message inaugural&quot; from 1974 to 1984.

In Hong Kong, the governor&#x27;s address was termed the &quot;Policy Address&quot; during Chris Patten&#x27;s governorship. In the Irish Free State, the governor-general delivered the &quot;Governor-General&#x27;s Address to Dáil Éireann&quot;; only two were ever given, in 1922 and 1923.

===History===
In the Commonwealth realms, the speech from the throne is an oration that forms part of a ceremony marking the opening of parliament. Some records indicate the ceremony has taken place since the Middle Ages, while others place its origins in the 16th century, when England was still an absolute monarchy. The speech explained to parliament the reasons it was summoned and sometimes set out the sovereign&#x27;s policies and objectives. The monarch would sometimes speak to parliament in person; Edward III (in 1365), Richard II, and Edward IV did so to both houses of parliament on multiple separate occasions.

However, various other figures gave the oration on the sovereign&#x27;s behalf: between 1347 and 1363, it was read by the chief justice; in 1401 by the chief justice of the Common Pleas; in 1344, 1368, 1377 (speaking for a presiding Edward III), 1399, and 1422, by the archbishop of Canterbury; and in 1343, 1363, and, usually after 1368, by the lord chancellor who was then the prolocutor, or chairman of the House of Lords. It was given on his behalf by the bishop of Winchester in 1410; in 1453 and 1467, the bishop of Lincoln; the bishop of Rochester in 1472; and the keeper of the Privy Seal in 1431. It may have been written by or with the input of the king&#x27;s or queen&#x27;s advisers, but, the monarch, as supreme governor, was the principal author.

===Modern times===
Today, within the tenets of constitutional monarchy, the speech is written by the sitting cabinet, with or without the reader&#x27;s participation, and outlines the legislative programme for the new parliamentary session. Due to the parliamentary tradition of the sovereign being barred from the lower chamber, in those realms possessing a bicameral parliament, the ceremony takes place in the legislature&#x27;s upper chamber, with members of both houses in attendance. In unicameral parliaments, the speech is read in the one legislative chamber. Unusually, in the Irish Free State, the speech was delivered in the lower house of its bicameral parliament.

In the United Kingdom, the speech is typically read by the reigning sovereign at the State Opening of Parliament. Traditions surrounding the opening and the speech go back to the 16th century. The present ceremony dates from 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was rebuilt after the 1834 fire. The ceremony now usually occurs annually, usually in November or December, or soon after a general election. The monarch may, however, appoint a delegate to perform the task in his or her place. Elizabeth II did this during her pregnancies in 1959 and 1963, when it was delivered instead by the Lord Chancellor; and again due to ill health in 2022, when it was delivered by Prince Charles (now Charles III); he and Prince William were acting as Counsellors of State.

In those countries that share with the UK the same person as their respective sovereign, the speech from the throne will usually be read on the monarch&#x27;s behalf by his or her viceroy, the governor-general, although the monarch may deliver the address in person: Queen Elizabeth II read the Throne Speech in the Parliament of New Zealand in 1954, 1963, 1970, 1974, 1977, 1986, and 1990, the Parliament of Australia in 1954 and 1974, and the Parliament of Canada in 1957 and 1977. Another member of the royal family may also perform this duty, such as when, on 1 September 1919, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) read the Speech From the Throne in the Canadian parliament. On two occasions, the administrator of the Government delivered the address to the Parliament of Canada: 16 May 1963 and 30 September 1974.

In the Australian states, the relevant governor reads the speech, though the Australian monarch may also perform the task: Queen Elizabeth II opened the parliaments of some of the Australian states in 1954 and of New South Wales in 1992. In almost all the Canadian provinces, the relevant lieutenant governor delivers the speech; it is uncertain whether the Canadian monarch can do the same in any legislature of a Canadian province. In Quebec, however, the speech is referred to as the &quot;Opening Address&quot; (). In each of the Canadian territories, the commissioner reads the Throne Speech or Opening Address to the legislature.

In British overseas territories that have instituted this practice, the relevant governor delivers the speech. A throne speech is not typical in the devolved legislatures within the United Kingdom; the nearest equivalent is a statement of the legislative agenda of the executive branch, usually given by a first minister. However, the British monarch often undertakes visits and speaks to the devolved bodies in a less official capacity. During her reign Queen Elizabeth II was present and gave an address at all openings of the Scottish parliament, usually speaking reflectively upon its accomplishments and wishing the institution well for its coming term rather than considering the plans of the executive.

It is considered improper for the audience, including members of parliament, to show support or disapproval for any content of the speech while it is being read: that is reserved to the debate and vote that follows in legislative chambers or chamber. In 1998 in the UK, when the Queen read out the proposed House of Lords Act 1999, Labour Party MPs briefly interrupted it by vocalising support while Conservative peers responded with &quot;shame!&quot;. Protest, though, has been expressed during a throne speech, such as when, in 2011, Brigette DePape, a page in the Canadian Senate, interrupted Governor General David Johnston&#x27;s reading of the Speech From the Throne by standing and holding a sign calling for the then Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, to be stopped.

===Address in reply===
Formally, the motion that follows the speech merely calls on parliament to thank the monarch or viceroy via an Address in Reply. The debate is, however, often wide-ranging, exploring many aspects of the government&#x27;s proposed policies, and spread over several days. When the Address in Reply is eventually voted on, the poll is held to constitute a motion of confidence in the government, which, if lost, would result in the end of that government&#x27;s mandate. In some legislatures, this discussion and vote is preceded by a symbolic raising of other matters, designed to highlight the independence of parliament from the Crown; a practice that originated after King Charles I was tried and executed by parliament. In the British House of Commons, the other business raised is by tradition the Outlawries Bill, while the House of Lords reads the Select Vestries Bill; neither proceeds past the first reading. In the House of Commons of Canada, the bill considered is Bill C-1, an Act Respecting the Administration of Oaths of Office, while in the Senate, it is Bill S-1, an Act Relating to Railways. The texts of these two bills have nothing to do with either oaths of office or railways; instead, they contain near-identical wordings that explain their &quot;pro forma&quot; function. In Australia and New Zealand, by contrast, no &quot;pro forma&quot; bills are introduced; there, the respective houses of representatives instead consider some brief and non-controversial business items before debating the Address in Reply.

==Other equivalents==

=== Japan ===

In Japan, the emperor makes only a short speech of greeting during the National Diet opening ceremony; he does not refer to any government policies, instead allowing the Prime Minister to address political matters, as in the contemporary cases in Sweden and Denmark.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysia also has the same practice, with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong making such an address to the Parliament of Malaysia in joint session during its state opening yearly every March.

=== Morocco ===
The king addresses parliament at the beginning of its yearly session on the second Friday of October. The speech may only be legally binding if it is read before both houses of parliament.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, the speech from the throne is held annually on the third Tuesday in September, which is called &quot;Prinsjesdag&quot; (Prince&#x27;s Day). Article 65 of the constitution states that &quot;A statement of the policy to be pursued by the Government is given by or on behalf of the King before a joint session of the two Houses of the States General that is held every year on the third Tuesday in September or on such earlier date as may be prescribed by Act of Parliament.&quot;

The monarch travels from Noordeinde Palace by coach to the Ridderzaal (Hall of Knights) in the Binnenhof of The Hague to read the speech before a joint session of the States General. Following the speech, the president of the joint session calls out &#x27;Long live the King!’ after which the monarch is greeted with three cheers. The monarch and his retinue leave and the joint session is declared to be closed. The monarch returns to the palace in the coach and, along with other members of the royal house, appears on the palace balcony. Following the 1983 revision of the constitution, a parliamentary session changed from lasting a year to lasting for four years. As a result, the speech no longer marks the opening of a session of parliament but the start of a new parliamentary year.

=== Norway ===

In Norway, the monarch is required by article 74 of the constitution to preside over the opening of a session of the Storting (which happens every October) after it has been declared to be legally constituted by the president of the Storting. The monarch delivers the speech before parliamentarians in the chamber of the Storting. The heir to the throne also regularly accompanies the monarch.

Upon the monarch&#x27;s arrival in the chamber, the members of the Storting stand and the first verse of the royal anthem, &quot;Kongesangen&quot;, is sung. The monarch is handed the speech by the prime minister and proceeds to deliver the speech while all remain standing. Afterwards, the monarch and members take their seats and the Report on the State of the Realm, an account of the government achievement of the past year, is read (traditionally in Nynorsk), customarily by the youngest member of the government present.

The members and monarch rise and the monarch is presented with the report by the prime minister and the monarch returns the speech and report to the president. The president gives some remarks and closes with &quot;May God preserve our King and country&quot;, joined by other members of the Storting and the first verse of the national anthem is then sung. After the monarch and his retinue have left, the meeting is adjourned and the speech and report are first debated at the subsequent sitting.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, speeches from the throne used to be practiced before the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. With the restoration of the Spanish monarchy in 1975, the monarch still opens parliament but no longer gives a &quot;speech from the throne&quot;. The monarch gives a speech but it does not focus on or direct government policy.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, the practice of having a speech from the throne given by the monarch was held until 1974, coinciding with the rewrite of the constitution of Sweden which removed formal involvement of the monarch in the legislative process. The old opening of the legislature was called &quot;The Solemn Opening of the Riksdag&quot; () and was full of symbolism. The speech was given before the Riksdag in the Hall of State at the Royal Palace. The King would be seated on the Silver Throne as he gave his speech.

Prior to 1907, the monarch and the princes of the royal blood would also wear their royal and princely robes and their crowns and coronets. After Oscar II&#x27;s death, his successor, Gustav V was not crowned, and thus did not wear the crown when opening the Riksdag. Instead, the crown and sceptre would be placed on cushions beside the throne and the robe would be draped on the throne.

After the abolition of the opening ceremony at the palace, last held in 1974 and only once during the reign of Carl XVI Gustaf, the opening is now held at the Riksdag chamber in the presence of the monarch and his family. It is still the monarch who officially opens the annual session but he no longer gives a &quot;speech from the throne&quot;; the monarch is invited by the Speaker and delivers an introductory speech and then declares the session open. After the speech, the Prime Minister delivers a statement of the upcoming government agenda () for the forthcoming legislative year is made.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, the monarch makes a speech at a joint session in the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, advising the National Assembly in their work.

=== Republics ===
Many republics also hold a yearly event in which the president gives a speech to a joint session of the legislature, such as the State of the Union address given by the president of the United States and in most U.S. states, where the governor gives a similar State of the State address. Similarly, the president of the Philippines gives the State of the Nation Address. In Hispanophone American countries, this practice is known as (message to the nation). Often such are on or near the first day of the legislature&#x27;s new session. However, in theory, rather than just outline the priorities for the coming year, the head of state is supposed to provide a report to the legislature on what the country&#x27;s condition is, hence the term &quot;State of the Nation&quot;.

=== European Union ===
The European Union equivalent is known as the State of the Union, in which the President of the European Commission addresses a plenary session of the European Parliament every September. It is regulated by the 2010 Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission.

<doc id="225027" wikidata="Q7090876" url="?curid=225027" title="On (Gary Glitter album)">
<text>On is the seventh and final studio album by English singer Gary Glitter, released in 2001.

==Background==
The album contains new recordings of songs that were only ever performed live during Glitter&#x27;s last concerts in 1996 and 1997. The album was released in 2001, two years after Glitter&#x27;s UK conviction for possession of child pornography. It was available only for a short time through Glitter&#x27;s website, and sold 5,000 copies worldwide. After his conviction, most major retailers had refused to stock and sell his music.

Nine of the twelve titles on the album, including the ballad &quot;Never Want The Rain&quot;, were co-written by Glitter with Martin Jenkins. The other three tracks were new recordings of earlier Glitter titles; &quot;Hooked On Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Hello, Hello, I&#x27;m Back Again&quot; were co-written by Glitter with Mike Leander, and first recorded in the 1970s. &quot;Ready To Rock&quot; was originally recorded by Glitter for his 1991 album &quot;Leader 2&quot;. Though Glitter has not issued a new studio album since &quot;On&quot;, he has continued to release singles.

As children are a major audience of pop music, controversy arose around the release of the album &quot;On&quot;, due to assertions that Glitter was exploiting children. MP Tom Watson considered writing to the Home Secretary, David Blunkett to block the album&#x27;s release, saying Glitter should be at the very least &quot;handled with care&quot;. In response to the complaints, the British Phonographic Industry issued a statement saying that Glitter was now a free man and there were no legal reasons the album could not be released.
