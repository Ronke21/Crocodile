<text>Bath Iron Works (BIW) is a major United States shipyard located on the Kennebec River in Bath, Maine, founded in 1884 as Bath Iron Works, Limited. Since 1995, Bath Iron Works has been a subsidiary of General Dynamics, one of the world&#x27;s largest defense companies. BIW has built private, commercial, and military vessels, most of which have been ordered by the United States Navy.

== History ==
Bath Iron Works was incorporated in 1884 by General Thomas W. Hyde, a native of Bath who served in the American Civil War. After the war, he bought a shop that made windlasses and other iron hardware for the wooden ships built in Bath&#x27;s many shipyards. He expanded the business by improving its practices, entering new markets, and acquiring other local businesses. By 1882, Hyde Windlass was eyeing the new and growing business of iron shipbuilding, and it incorporated as Bath Iron Works in 1884.

On February 28, 1890, BIW won its first contract for complete vessels: two iron gunboats for the Navy. One of these ships was the , the first ship launched by the company. In 1892, the yard won its first commercial contract for the 2,500-ton steel passenger steamer . In the 1890s, the company built several yachts for wealthy sailors.

In 1899, Hyde was suffering from Bright&#x27;s Disease and resigned from management of the shipyard, leaving his sons Edward and John in charge. The shipyard began construction of that same year, the only battleship ever built in Bath. It dominated the yard for five years until its launching in 1904, and was at times the only ship under construction. The yard faced numerous challenges because of the weight of armor and weapons. In sea trials, &quot;Georgia&quot; averaged for four hours, making her the fastest ship in her class and the fastest battleship in the United States Navy at the time.

The company continued to rely on Navy contracts, which provided 86-percent of the value of new contracts between 1905 and 1917. The yard also produced fishing trawlers, freighters, and yachts throughout the first half of the century. These included &quot;Vanda&quot;, &quot;Hi-Esmaro&quot;, &quot;Aras I&quot; and &quot;Aras II&quot;, &quot;Caroline&quot;, and &quot;Corsair IV&quot;, which later served as a cruise ship before sinking off Acapulco, Mexico in 1949.

The shipyard was at peak production during World War II (1943–1944), launching a destroyer every 17 days. Bath Iron Works ranked 50th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. In 1981, Falcon Transport ordered two tankers, the last commercial vessels built by BIW.

 was commissioned at Bath in 1986. It survived a mine explosion which tore a hole in its engine room and flooded two compartments. Over the next two years, BIW repaired the ship in unique fashion. The guided missile frigate was towed to the company&#x27;s dry dock in Portland, Maine, and put up on blocks, where the damaged engine room was cut out of the ship. Meanwhile, workers in Bath built a 315-ton replacement, and the module was floated south to Portland, placed on the dry dock, slid into place under the frigate, jacked up, and welded into place.

In 1995, Bath Iron Works was bought by General Dynamics. In 2001, the company wrapped up a four-year effort to build the Land Level Transfer Facility, an enormous concrete platform for final assembly of its ships, instead of building them on a sloping way so that they could slide into the Kennebec at launch. Hulls are now moved by rail from the platform horizontally onto a moveable dry dock, which greatly reduced the work involved in building and launching the ships. The , 28,000-ton dry dock was built by China&#x27;s Jiangdu Yuchai Shipbuilding Company for $27 million and shipped all the way from China to Bath.

In 2015, Bath Iron Works signed contracts with US Navy to build new &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers, as well as to conduct maintenance sustainment support of &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral combat ships built by competitor Austal USA. The shipyard delivered and and is working on and . The DDG block buy for Bath also includes , , and . On March 27, Bath received a $610.4 million contract modification to build &quot;John Basilone&quot;. This ship was funded in the 2015 defense appropriations act.

In 2016, Dirk Lesko became president of Bath Iron Works.

In 2020, 4,300 workers, all members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, voted to go on strike after the company and the union failed to agree to new labor contracts. The shipbuilders eventually agreed to a 3-year pact and returned to work after 63 days of strike.

Lesko resigned unexpectedly on April 7, 2022, the same day the union local announced that it had come to an agreement with the shipyard. On May 5, 2022, Charles F. Krugh was appointed president.

== Offsite facilities ==
Bath Iron Works operates several offsite facilities in the surrounding mid-coast Maine region, their purposes range from administration to structural fabrication. 

=== West Bath ===
• &quot;West Bath Warehouse&quot; • The facility closest to the main yard, located on 76 New Meadows Road, West Bath. Its primary responsibilities are storage and distribution of materials to other BIW facilities, primarily the main yard. 

=== Brunswick ===
The neighboring city of Brunswick, Maine, Contains the most Bath Iron Works offsite facilities of any single municipality. 

• &quot;Structural Fabrication&quot; • Built in 1940 under the name &quot;Harding&#x27;s Plant&quot;, the Structural Fabrication facility is among the largest outside of the main yard.

• &quot;Outfit Fabrication&quot; • Previously known as &quot;East Brunswick Manufacturing Facility (EBMF)&quot;, the Outfit Fabrication facility is responsible for the production of non-structural parts and assemblies more efficient to build on the shop floor, and later ship into the main yard.

• &quot;Tech Center&quot; • The Tech Center is where many Planners, Designers, and Engineers work.

<text>Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld (; 5 December 1868 – 26 April 1951) was a German theoretical physicist who pioneered developments in atomic and quantum physics, and also educated and mentored many students for the new era of theoretical physics. He served as doctoral supervisor and postdoc supervisor to seven Nobel Prize winners and supervised at least 30 other famous physicists and chemists. Only J. J. Thomson&#x27;s record of mentorship offers a comparable list of high-achieving students.

He introduced the second quantum number, azimuthal quantum number, and the third quantum number, magnetic quantum number. He also introduced the fine-structure constant and pioneered X-ray wave theory.

==Early life and education==
Sommerfeld was born in 1868 to a family with deep ancestral roots in Prussia. His mother Cäcilie Matthias (1839–1902) was the daughter of a Potsdam builder. His father Franz Sommerfeld (1820–1906) was a physician from a leading family in Königsberg, where Arnold&#x27;s grandfather had resettled from the hinterland in 1822 for a career as Court Postal Secretary in the service of the Kingdom of Prussia. Sommerfeld was baptized a Christian in his family&#x27;s Prussian Evangelical Protestant Church, and although not religious, he would never renounce his Christian faith.

Sommerfeld studied mathematics and physical sciences at the Albertina University of his native city, Königsberg, East Prussia. His dissertation advisor was the mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann, and he also benefited from classes with mathematicians Adolf Hurwitz and David Hilbert and physicist Emil Wiechert. His participation in the student fraternity Deutsche Burschenschaft resulted in a dueling scar on his face. He received his Ph.D. on 24 October 1891 (age 22).

After receiving his doctorate, Sommerfeld remained at Königsberg to work on his teaching diploma. He passed the national exam in 1892 and then began a year of military service, which was done with the reserve regiment in Königsberg. He completed his obligatory military service in September 1893, and for the next eight years continued voluntary eight-week military service. With his turned up moustache, his physical build, his Prussian bearing, and the fencing scar on his face, he gave the impression of being a colonel in the hussars.

==Career==

===Göttingen===
In October 1893, Sommerfeld went to the University of Göttingen, which was the center of mathematics in Germany. There, he became assistant to Theodor Liebisch, at the Mineralogical Institute, through a fortunate personal contact – Liebisch had been a professor at the University of Königsberg and a friend of the Sommerfeld family.

In September 1894, Sommerfeld became Felix Klein&#x27;s assistant, which included taking comprehensive notes during Klein&#x27;s lectures and writing them up for the Mathematics Reading Room, as well as managing the reading room. Sommerfeld&#x27;s Habilitationsschrift was completed under Klein, in 1895, which allowed Sommerfeld to become a Privatdozent at Göttingen. As a Privatdozent, Sommerfeld lectured on a wide range of mathematical and mathematical physics topics. His lectures on partial differential equations were first offered at Göttingen, and they evolved over his teaching career to become Volume VI of his textbook series &quot;Lectures on Theoretical Physics&quot;, under the title &quot;Partial Differential Equations in Physics&quot;.
Lectures by Klein in 1895 and 1896 on rotating bodies led Klein and Sommerfeld to write a four-volume text &quot;Die Theorie des Kreisels&quot; – a 13-year collaboration, 1897–1910. The first two volumes were on theory, and the latter two were on applications in geophysics, astronomy, and technology. The association Sommerfeld had with Klein influenced Sommerfeld&#x27;s turn of mind to be applied mathematics and in the art of lecturing.

While at Göttingen, Sommerfeld met Johanna Höpfner, daughter of Ernst Höpfner, curator at Göttingen. In October 1897 Sommerfeld began the appointment to the Chair of Mathematics at the Bergakademie in Clausthal-Zellerfeld; he was successor to Wilhelm Wien. This appointment provided enough income to eventually marry Johanna.

At Klein&#x27;s request, Sommerfeld took on the position of editor of Volume V of &quot;Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften&quot;; it was a major undertaking which lasted from 1898 to 1926.

===Aachen===
In 1900, Sommerfeld started his appointment to the Chair of Applied Mechanics at the &quot;Königliche Technische Hochschule Aachen&quot; (later RWTH Aachen University) as extraordinarius professor, which was arranged through Klein&#x27;s efforts. At Aachen, he developed the theory of hydrodynamics, which would retain his interest for a long time. Later, at the University of Munich, Sommerfeld&#x27;s students Ludwig Hopf and Werner Heisenberg would write their Ph.D. theses on this topic. For his contributions to the understanding of journal bearing lubrication during his time at Aachen, he was named as one of the 23 &quot;Men of Tribology&quot; by Duncan Dowson.

===Munich===
From 1906, Sommerfeld established himself as ordinarius professor of physics and director of the new Theoretical Physics Institute at the University of Munich. He was selected for these positions by Wilhelm Röntgen, Director of the Physics Institute at Munich, which was looked upon by Sommerfeld as being called to a &quot;privileged sphere of action&quot;.

Until the late 19th century and early 20th century, experimental physics in Germany was considered as having a higher status within the community. In the early 20th century, theorists, such as Sommerfeld at Munich and Max Born at the University of Göttingen, with their early training in mathematics, turned this around so that mathematical physics, i.e., theoretical physics, became the prime mover, and experimental physics was used to verify or advance theory. After getting their doctorates with Sommerfeld, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg, and Walter Heitler became Born&#x27;s assistants and made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, which was then in very rapid development.

During his 32 years of teaching at Munich, Sommerfeld taught general and specialized courses, as well as holding seminars and colloquia. The general courses were on mechanics, mechanics of deformable bodies, electrodynamics, optics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and partial differential equations in physics. They were held four hours per week, 13 weeks in the winter and 11 weeks in the summer, and were for students who had taken experimental physics courses from Röntgen and later by Wilhelm Wien. There was also a two-hour weekly presentation for the discussion of problems. The specialized courses were of topical interest and based on Sommerfeld&#x27;s research interests; material from these courses appeared later in the scientific literature publications of Sommerfeld. The objective of these special lectures was to grapple with current issues in theoretical physics and for Sommerfeld and the students to garner a systematic comprehension of the issue, independent of whether or not they were successful in solving the problem posed by the current issue. For the seminar and colloquium periods, students were assigned papers from the current literature and they then prepared an oral presentation. From 1942 to 1951, Sommerfeld worked on putting his lecture notes in order for publication. They were published as the six-volume &quot;Lectures on Theoretical Physics&quot;.

For a list of students, please see the list organized by type. Four of Sommerfeld&#x27;s doctoral students, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Peter Debye, and Hans Bethe went on to win Nobel Prizes, while others, most notably, Walter Heitler, Rudolf Peierls, Karl Bechert, Hermann Brück, Paul Peter Ewald, Eugene Feenberg, Herbert Fröhlich, Erwin Fues, Ernst Guillemin, Helmut Hönl, Ludwig Hopf, Adolf Kratzer, Otto Laporte, Wilhelm Lenz, Karl Meissner, Rudolf Seeliger, Ernst C. Stückelberg, Heinrich Welker, Gregor Wentzel, Alfred Landé, and Léon Brillouin became famous in their own right. Three of Sommerfeld&#x27;s postdoctoral supervisees, Linus Pauling, Isidor I. Rabi and Max von Laue, won Nobel Prizes, and ten others, William Allis, Edward Condon, Carl Eckart, Edwin C. Kemble, William V. Houston, Karl Herzfeld, Walther Kossel, Philip M. Morse, Howard Robertson, and Wojciech Rubinowicz went on to become famous in their own right. Walter Rogowski, an undergraduate student of Sommerfeld at RWTH Aachen, also went on to become famous in his own right. Max Born believed Sommerfeld&#x27;s abilities included the &quot;discovery and development of talents&quot;. Albert Einstein told Sommerfeld: &quot;What I especially admire about you is that you have, as it were, pounded out of the soil such a large number of young talents.&quot; Sommerfeld&#x27;s style as a professor and institute director did not put distance between him and his colleagues and students. He invited collaboration from them, and their ideas often influenced his own views in physics. He entertained them in his home and met with them in cafes before and after seminars and colloquia. Sommerfeld owned an alpine ski hut to which students were often invited for discussions of physics as demanding as the sport.

While at Munich, Sommerfeld came in contact with the special theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which was not yet widely accepted. His mathematical contributions to the theory helped its acceptance by the skeptics. In 1914 he worked with Léon Brillouin on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in dispersive media. He became one of the founders of quantum mechanics; some of his contributions included co-discovery of the Sommerfeld–Wilson quantization rules (1915), a generalization of Bohr&#x27;s atomic model, introduction of the Sommerfeld fine-structure constant (1916), co-discovery with Walther Kossel of the Sommerfeld–Kossel displacement law (1919), and publishing &quot;Atombau und Spektrallinien&quot; (1919), which became the &quot;bible&quot; of atomic theory for the new generation of physicists who developed atomic and quantum physics. The book underwent 4 editions from 1919 to 1924, to incorporate the latest advances in quantum mechanics, before splitting into two volumes.

In 1918, Sommerfeld succeeded Einstein as chair of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG). One of his accomplishments was the founding of a new journal. The scientific papers published in DPG journals became so voluminous, that in 1919 a committee of the DPG recommended the establishment of &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot; for publication of original research articles, which commenced in 1920. Since any reputable scientist could have their article published without refereeing, time between submission and publication was very rapid – as fast as two weeks. This greatly stimulated the scientific theoretical developments, especially that of quantum mechanics in Germany at that time, as this journal was the preferred publication vehicle for the new generation of quantum theorists with avant-garde views.

In the winter semester of 1922/1923, Sommerfeld gave the Carl Schurz Memorial Professor of Physics lectures at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In 1927 Sommerfeld applied Fermi–Dirac statistics to the Drude model of electrons in metals – a model put forth by Paul Drude. The new theory solved many of the problems predicting thermal properties the original model had and became known as the Drude–Sommerfeld model.

In 1928/1929, Sommerfeld traveled globally, with major stops in India, China, Japan, and the United States.

Sommerfeld was a great theoretician. Besides his invaluable contributions to quantum theory, he worked in other fields of physics, such as the classical theory of electromagnetism. For example, he proposed a solution to the problem of a radiating hertzian dipole over a conducting earth, which over the years led to many applications. His Sommerfeld identity and Sommerfeld integrals are to the present day the most common way to solve this kind of problem. Also, as a mark of the prowess of Sommerfeld&#x27;s school of theoretical physics and the rise of theoretical physics in the early 1900s, as of 1928, nearly one-third of the ordinarius professors of theoretical physics in the German-speaking world were students of Sommerfeld.
On 1 April 1935 Sommerfeld achieved emeritus status. He remained as his own temporary replacement during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty&#x27;s selection and that of both the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM; Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of , which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially including quantum mechanics. The appointment of Wilhelm Müller – who was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft – as a replacement for Sommerfeld, was considered such a travesty and detrimental to educating a new generation of physicists that both Ludwig Prandtl, director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut für Strömungsforschung (Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research), and Carl Ramsauer, director of the research division of the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (General Electric Company) and president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, made reference to this in their correspondence to officials in the Reich. In an attachment to Prandtl&#x27;s 28 April 1941 letter to Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, Prandtl referred to the appointment as &quot;sabotage&quot; of necessary theoretical physics instruction. In an attachment to Ramsauer&#x27;s 20 January 1942 letter to Reich Minister Bernhard Rust, Ramsauer concluded that the appointment amounted to the &quot;destruction of the Munich theoretical physics tradition&quot;.

As for Sommerfeld&#x27;s once patriotic views, he wrote to Einstein shortly after Hitler took power: &quot;I can assure you that the misuse of the word ‘national’ by our rulers has thoroughly broken me of the habit of national feelings that was so pronounced in my case. I would now be willing to see Germany disappear as a power and merge into a pacified Europe.&quot;

Sommerfeld was awarded many honors in his lifetime, such as the Lorentz Medal, the Max-Planck Medal, the Oersted Medal, election to the Royal Society of London, the United States National Academy of Sciences, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Indian Academy of Sciences, and other academies including those in Berlin, Munich, Göttingen, and Vienna, as well as having conferred on him numerous honorary degrees from universities including Rostock, Aachen, Calcutta, and Athens. He was elected an Honorary member of the Optical Society in 1950. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize 84 times, more than any other physicist (including Otto Stern, who got nominated 82 times), but he never received the award.

Sommerfeld died on April 26, 1951, in Munich from injuries after a traffic accident while walking with his grandchildren. The accident occurred at the corner of Dietlindenstrasse and Biedersteiner Strasse near his house which was located at Dunantstrasse 6. He is buried at the Nordfriedhof close to where he lived at the time.

In 2004, the center for theoretical physics at the University of Munich was named after him.

<doc id="213641" wikidata="Q1417088" url="?curid=213641" title="Iñupiat">
<text>The Inupiat (singular: Iñupiaq) are a group of Alaska Natives whose traditional territory roughly spans northeast from Norton Sound on the Bering Sea to the northernmost part of the Canada–United States border. Their current communities include 34 villages across &quot;Iñupiat Nunaat&quot; (Iñupiaq lands), including seven Alaskan villages in the North Slope Borough, affiliated with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation; eleven villages in Northwest Arctic Borough; and sixteen villages affiliated with the Bering Straits Regional Corporation. They often claim to be the first people of the Kauwerak.

==Name==
Inupiat () is the plural form of the name for the people (e.g., the Inupiat live in several communities.). The singular form is Iñupiaq () (e.g., She is an Iñupiaq), which also sometimes refers to the language (e.g., She speaks Iñupiaq). In English, both Inupiat and Iñupiaq are used as modifiers (e.g., An Inupiat/Iñupiaq librarian, Inupiat/Iñupiaq songs). The language is called Inupiatun in Inupiatun and frequently in English as well. Iñupiak () is the dual form.

The roots are &quot;&quot; &quot;person&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;real&quot;, i.e., an endonym meaning &quot;real people&quot;.

The Inupiat are made up of the following communities

* Bering Strait Inupiat (Sivunmiut)
* South Seward Peninsula Inupiat (Qawiaraq Inupiat)
* Nunamiut
* Northwest Arctic Inupiat (Malimiut)
* North Alaska Coast Iñupiat (Taġiuġmiut, people of the sea, or Siḷaliñiġmiut)
==Regional corporations==
In 1971, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act established thirteen Alaskan Native Regional Corporations. The purpose of the regional corporations were to create institutions in which Native Alaskans would generate venues to provide services for its members, who were incorporated as &quot;shareholders&quot;. Three regional corporations are located in the lands of the Inupiat. These are the following.
* Arctic Slope Regional Corporation
* Bering Straits Native Corporation
* NANA Regional Corporation.

== Tribal Governments ==

Prior to colonization, the Inupiat exercised sovereignty based on complex social structures and order. Despite the transfer of land from Russia to the U.S. and eventual annexation of Alaska, Inupiat sovereignty continues to be articulated in various ways. A limited form of this sovereignty has been recognized by Federal Indian Law, which outlines the relationship between the federal government and American Indians. The Federal Indian Law recognized Tribal governments as having limited self-determination. In 1993, the federal government extended federal recognition to Alaskan Natives tribes. Tribal governments created avenues for tribes to contract with the federal government to manage programs that directly benefit Native peoples. Throughout Inupiat lands, there are various regional and village tribal governments. The tribal governments vary in structure and services provided, but often are related to the social well-being of the communities. Services included but are not limited to education, housing, tribal services, and supporting healthy families and cultural connection to place and community.

The following Alaska Native tribal entities for the Inupiat are recognized by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs:

==Languages==
Inuit, the language and the people, extend borders and dialects across the Circumpolar North. Inuit are the Native inhabitants of Northern Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Inuit languages have differing names depending on the region it is spoken in. In Northern Alaskan, the Inuit language is called Iñupiatun. Within Iñupiatun, there are four major dialects: North Slope, Malimiut, Bering Straits, and Qawiaraq. Before European contact, the Iñupiaq dialects flourished. Due to harsh assimilation efforts in Native American boarding schools, Natives were punished for speaking their language. Now only 2,000 of the approximately 24,500 Inupiat can speak their Native tongue.

Revitalization efforts have focused on Alaskan Native languages and ways of life. Located in Kotzebue, Alaska, an Iñupiaq language immersion school called Nikaitchuat Iḷisaġviat was established in 1998. The immersion school&#x27;s mission is to &quot;instill the knowledge of Iñupiaq identity, dignity, respect and to cultivate a love of lifelong learning&quot;. June Nelson Elementary school is another school in Kotzebue that is working to include more content into their curriculum about Iñupiaq language and culture. Nome Elementary School in Nome, Alaska has also put in place plans to incorporate an Iñupiaq language immersion program. There are many courses being offered at the various campuses a part of the University of Alaska system. University of Alaska Fairbanks offers several course in the Iñupiaq language. University of Alaska Anchorage offers multiple levels of Elementary Iñupiaq Language and Alaskan Native language apprenticeship and fluency intensive courses.

Since 2017, a grassroots group of Iñupiaq language learners have organized Iḷisaqativut, a two-week Iñupiaq language intensive that is held throughout communities in the Inupiaq region. The first gathering was held in Utqiaġvik in 2017, Siqnasuaq (Nome) in 2018, and Qikiqtaġruk (Kotzebue) in 2019.

Kawerak, a nonprofit organization from the Bering Strait region, has created a language glossary that features terms from Iñupiaq, as well as terms from English, Yup&#x27;ik, and St. Lawrence Island Yupik.

Several Inupiat developed pictographic writing systems in the early twentieth century. It is known as Alaskan Picture Writing.

==History==
Along with other Inuit groups, the Iñupiaq originate from the Thule culture. Circa 300 B.C., the Thule migrated from islands in the Bering Sea to what now is Alaska.

Iñupiaq groups, in common with Inuit-speaking groups, often have a name ending in &quot;miut,&quot; which means &#x27;a people of&#x27;. One example is the &quot;Nunamiut,&quot; a generic term for inland Iñupiaq caribou hunters. During a period of starvation and an influenza epidemic introduced by American and European whaling crews, most of these people moved to the coast or other parts of Alaska between 1890 and 1910. A number of Nunamiut returned to the mountains in the 1930s.

By 1950, most Nunamiut groups, such as the Killikmiut, had coalesced in Anaktuvuk Pass, a village in north-central Alaska. Some of the Nunamiut remained nomadic until the 1950s.

The Iditarod Trail&#x27;s antecedents were the native trails of the Dena&#x27;ina and Deg Hit&#x27;an Athabaskan American Indians and the Inupiat.

==Subsistence==
Inupiat are hunter-gatherers, as are most Arctic peoples. Inupiat continue to rely heavily on subsistence hunting and fishing. Depending on their location, they harvest walrus, seal, whale, polar bears, caribou, and fish. Both the inland (Nunamiut) and coastal (Tikiġaġmiut) Inupiat depend greatly on fish. Throughout the seasons, when they are available, food staples also include 
ducks, geese, rabbits, berries, roots, and shoots.

The inland Inupiat also hunt caribou, Dall sheep, grizzly bear, and moose. The coastal Inupiat hunt walrus, seals, beluga whales, and bowhead whales. Cautiously, polar bear also is hunted.

The capture of a whale benefits each member of an Inupiat community, as the animal is butchered and its meat and blubber are allocated according to a traditional formula. Even city-dwelling relatives, thousands of miles away, are entitled to a share of each whale killed by the hunters of their ancestral village. Maktak, which is the skin and blubber of bowhead and other whales, is rich in vitamins A and C. The vitamin C content of meats is destroyed by cooking, so consumption of raw meats and these vitamin-rich foods contributes to good health in a population with limited access to fruits and vegetables.

A major value within subsistence hunting is the utilization of the whole catch or animal. This is demonstrated in the utilization of the hides to turn into clothing, as seen with seal skin, moose and caribou hides, polar bear hides. Fur from rabbits, beaver, marten, otter, and squirrels are also utilized to adorn clothing for warmth. These hides and furs are used to make parkas, mukluks, hats, gloves, and slippers. Qiviut is also gathered as Muskox shed their underlayer of fur and it is spun into wool to make scarves, hats, and gloves. The use of the animal&#x27;s hides and fur have kept Inupiat warm throughout the harsh conditions of their homelands, as many of the materials provide natural waterproof or windproof qualities. Other animal parts that have been utilized are the walrus intestines that are made into dance drums and &quot;qayaq&quot; or &quot;umiaq&quot;, traditional skin boats.

The walrus tusks of ivory and the baleen of bowhead whales are also utilized as Native expressions of art or tools. The use of these sensitive materials are inline with the practice of utilizing the gifts from the animals that are subsisted. There are protective policies on the harvesting of walrus and whales. The harvest of walrus solely for the use of ivory is highly looked down upon as well as prohibited by federal law with lengthy and costly punishments.

Since the 1970s, oil and other resources have been an important revenue source for the Inupiat. The Alaska Pipeline connects the Prudhoe Bay wells with the port of Valdez in south-central Alaska. Because of the oil drilling in Alaska&#x27;s arid north, however, the traditional way of whaling is coming into conflict with one of the modern world&#x27;s most pressing demands: finding more oil.

The Inupiat eat a variety of berries and when mixed with tallow, make a traditional dessert. They also mix the berries with rosehips and highbush cranberries and boil them into a syrup.

==Culture==

Historically, some Inupiat lived in sedentary communities, while others were nomadic. Some villages in the area have been occupied by Indigenous groups for more than 10,000 years.

The Nalukataq is a spring whaling festival among Inupiat. The festival celebrates traditional whale hunting and honors the whale&#x27;s spirit as it gave its physical body to feed entire villages. The whale&#x27;s spirit is honored by dance groups from across the North performing songs and dances.

The Iñupiat Ilitqusiat is a list of values that define Inupiat. It was created by elders in Kotzebue, Alaska, yet the values resonate with and have been articulated similarly by other Iñupiat communities. These values include: respect for elders, hard work, hunter&#x27;s success, family roles, humor, respect for nature, knowledge of family tree, respect for others, sharing, love for children, cooperation, avoid conflict, responsibility to tribe, humility, and spirituality.

These values serve as guideposts of how Inupiat are to live their lives. They inform and can be derived from Iñupiaq subsistence practices.

There is one Iñupiaq culture-oriented institute of higher education, Iḷisaġvik College, located in Utqiaġvik.

== Current issues ==
Inupiat have grown more concerned in recent years that climate change is threatening their traditional lifestyle. The warming trend in the Arctic affects their lifestyle in numerous ways, for example: thinning sea ice makes it more difficult to harvest bowhead whales, seals, walrus, and other traditional foods as it changes the migration patterns of marine mammals that rely on iceflows and the thinning sea ice can result in people falling through the ice; warmer winters make travel more dangerous and less predictable as more storms form; later-forming sea ice contributes to increased flooding and erosion along the coast as there is an increase in fall storms, directly imperiling many coastal villages. The Inuit Circumpolar Council, a group representing indigenous peoples of the Arctic, has made the case that climate change represents a threat to their human rights.

As of the 2000 U.S. Census, the Inupiat population in the United States numbered more than 19,000. Most of them live in Alaska.

<text>The following is a chronology of the top ten leaders in lifetime home runs in Major League Baseball. This includes any home runs hit by a player during official regular season games (i.e., excluding playoffs or exhibition games) in the National Association (1871–1875), National League (since 1876), the American Association (1882–1891), the Union Association (1884), the Players&#x27; League (1890), the American League (since 1901), and the Federal League (1914–1915).

The list helps contextualize the evolution of one of the most prized achievements in United States sports. In the early 1930s, Babe Ruth had almost 400 more home runs than the next player, his longtime teammate Lou Gehrig; when Joe DiMaggio retired in 1951, he was fifth on the all-time list.

==Career home run leaders by year==


:Statistics updated through season.

==Leadership dates==
Starting with Harry Stovey passing Charley Jones in August 1885, there have been seven changes of the career home run leader. Stovey held the title twice, having lost it to Dan Brouthers in June 1887 and then regaining it from Brouthers in August 1889. In the modern era—since the formation of the American League in 1901—there have only been four players who have held the title.

<doc id="213650" wikidata="Q1321469" url="?curid=213650" title="Order topology">
<text>In mathematics, an order topology is a specific topology that can be defined on any totally ordered set. It is a natural generalization of the topology of the real numbers to arbitrary totally ordered sets. 

If &quot;X&quot; is a totally ordered set, the order topology on &quot;X&quot; is generated by the subbase of &quot;open rays&quot;
:formula_1
:formula_2
for all &quot;a, b&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Provided &quot;X&quot; has at least two elements, this is equivalent to saying that the open intervals
:formula_3
together with the above rays form a base for the order topology. The open sets in &quot;X&quot; are the sets that are a union of (possibly infinitely many) such open intervals and rays.

A topological space &quot;X&quot; is called orderable or linearly orderable if there exists a total order on its elements such that the order topology induced by that order and the given topology on &quot;X&quot; coincide. The order topology makes &quot;X&quot; into a completely normal Hausdorff space.

The standard topologies on R, Q, Z, and N are the order topologies.

== Induced order topology ==
If &quot;Y&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;X&quot; a totally ordered set, then &quot;Y&quot; inherits a total order from &quot;X&quot;. The set &quot;Y&quot; therefore has an order topology, the induced order topology. As a subset of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; also has a subspace topology. The subspace topology is always at least as fine as the induced order topology, but they are not in general the same.

For example, consider the subset &quot;Y&quot; = {−1} ∪ {1/&quot;n&quot;&amp;hairsp;}&quot;n&quot;∈N of the rationals. Under the subspace topology, the singleton set {−1} is open in &quot;Y&quot;, but under the induced order topology, any open set containing −1 must contain all but finitely many members of the space.

== Example of a subspace of a linearly ordered space whose topology is not an order topology ==
Though the subspace topology of &quot;Y&quot; = {−1} ∪ {1/&quot;n&quot;&amp;hairsp;}&quot;n&quot;∈N in the section above is shown not to be generated by the induced order on &quot;Y&quot;, it is nonetheless an order topology on &quot;Y&quot;; indeed, in the subspace topology every point is isolated (i.e., singleton {&quot;y&quot;} is open in &quot;Y&quot; for every &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot;), so the subspace topology is the discrete topology on &quot;Y&quot; (the topology in which every subset of &quot;Y&quot; is open), and the discrete topology on any set is an order topology. To define a total order on &quot;Y&quot; that generates the discrete topology on &quot;Y&quot;, simply modify the induced order on &quot;Y&quot; by defining −1 to be the greatest element of &quot;Y&quot; and otherwise keeping the same order for the other points, so that in this new order (call it say &lt;1) we have 1/&quot;n&quot; &lt;1 −1 for all &quot;n&quot; ∈ N. Then, in the order topology on &quot;Y&quot; generated by &lt;1, every point of &quot;Y&quot; is isolated in &quot;Y&quot;.

We wish to define here a subset &quot;Z&quot; of a linearly ordered topological space &quot;X&quot; such that no total order on &quot;Z&quot; generates the subspace topology on &quot;Z&quot;, so that the subspace topology will not be an order topology even though it is the subspace topology of a space whose topology is an order topology.

Let formula_4 in the real line. The same argument as before shows that the subspace topology on &quot;Z&quot; is not equal to the induced order topology on &quot;Z&quot;, but one can show that the subspace topology on &quot;Z&quot; cannot be equal to any order topology on &quot;Z&quot;.

An argument follows. Suppose by way of contradiction that there is some strict total order &lt; on &quot;Z&quot; such that the order topology generated by &lt; is equal to the subspace topology on &quot;Z&quot; (note that we are not assuming that &lt; is the induced order on &quot;Z&quot;, but rather an arbitrarily given total order on &quot;Z&quot; that generates the subspace topology).

Let &quot;M&quot; = &quot;Z&quot; \ {−1} = (0,1), then &quot;M&quot; is connected, so &quot;M&quot; is dense on itself and has no gaps, in regards to &lt;. If −1 is not the smallest or the largest element of &quot;Z&quot;, then formula_5 and formula_6 separate &quot;M&quot;, a contradiction. Assume without loss of generality that −1 is the smallest element of &quot;Z&quot;. Since {−1} is open in &quot;Z&quot;, there is some point &quot;p&quot; in &quot;M&quot; such that the interval (−1,&quot;p&quot;) is empty, so &quot;p&quot; is the minimum of &quot;M&quot;. Then &quot;M&quot; \ {&quot;p&quot;} = (0,&quot;p&quot;) ∪ (&quot;p&quot;,1) is not connected with respect to the subspace topology inherited from . On the other hand, the subspace topology of &quot;M&quot; \ {&quot;p&quot;} inherited from the order topology of &quot;Z&quot; coincides with the order topology of &quot;M&quot; \ {&quot;p&quot;} induced by &lt;, which is connected since there are no gaps in &quot;M&quot; \ {&quot;p&quot;} and it is dense. This is a contradiction.

==Left and right order topologies==
Several variants of the order topology can be given:

* The right order topology on &quot;X&quot; is the topology having as a base all intervals of the form formula_7, together with the set &quot;X&quot;.
* The left order topology on &quot;X&quot; is the topology having as a base all intervals of the form formula_8, together with the set &quot;X&quot;.

These topologies naturally arise when working with semicontinuous functions, in that a real-valued function on a topological space is lower semicontinuous if and only if it is continuous when the reals are equipped with the left order . The (natural) compact open topology on the resulting set of continuous functions is sometimes referred to as the &quot;semicontinuous topology&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Additionally, these topologies can be used to give counterexamples in general topology. For example, the left or right order topology on a bounded set provides an example of a compact space that is not Hausdorff.

The left order topology is the standard topology used for many set-theoretic purposes on a Boolean algebra.

==Ordinal space==

For any ordinal number &quot;λ&quot; one can consider the spaces of ordinal numbers
:formula_9
:formula_10
together with the natural order topology. These spaces are called ordinal spaces. (Note that in the usual set-theoretic construction of ordinal numbers we have &quot;λ&quot; = [0, &quot;λ&quot;) and &quot;λ&quot; + 1 = [0, &quot;λ&quot;]). Obviously, these spaces are mostly of interest when &quot;λ&quot; is an infinite ordinal; for finite ordinals, the order topology is simply the discrete topology.

When &quot;λ&quot; = ω (the first infinite ordinal), the space [0,ω) is just N with the usual (still discrete) topology, while [0,ω] is the one-point compactification of N.

Of particular interest is the case when &quot;λ&quot; = ω1, the set of all countable ordinals, and the first uncountable ordinal. The element ω1 is a limit point of the subset [0,ω1) even though no sequence of elements in [0,ω1) has the element ω1 as its limit. In particular, [0,ω1] is not first-countable. The subspace [0,ω1) is first-countable however, since the only point in [0,ω1] without a countable local base is ω1. Some further properties include
*neither [0,ω1) or [0,ω1] is separable or second-countable
*[0,ω1] is compact, while [0,ω1) is sequentially compact and countably compact, but not compact or paracompact

== Topology and ordinals ==

=== Ordinals as topological spaces ===
Any ordinal number can be viewed as a topological space by endowing it with the order topology (indeed, ordinals are well-ordered, so in particular totally ordered). Unless otherwise specified, this is the usual topology given to ordinals. Moreover, if we are willing to accept a proper class as a topological space, then we may similarly view the class of all ordinals as a topological space with the order topology.

The set of limit points of an ordinal &quot;α&quot; is precisely the set of limit ordinals less than &quot;α&quot;. Successor ordinals (and zero) less than &quot;α&quot; are isolated points in &quot;α&quot;. In particular, the finite ordinals and ω are discrete topological spaces, and no ordinal beyond that is discrete. The ordinal &quot;α&quot; is compact as a topological space if and only if &quot;α&quot; is either a successor ordinal or zero.

The closed sets of a limit ordinal &quot;α&quot; are just the closed sets in the sense that we have already defined, namely, those that contain a limit ordinal whenever they contain all sufficiently large ordinals below it.

Any ordinal is, of course, an open subset of any larger ordinal. We can also define the topology on the ordinals in the following inductive way: 0 is the empty topological space, &quot;α&quot;+1 is obtained by taking the one-point compactification of &quot;α&quot;, and for &quot;δ&quot; a limit ordinal, &quot;δ&quot; is equipped with the inductive limit topology. Note that if &quot;α&quot; is a successor ordinal, then &quot;α&quot; is compact, in which case its one-point compactification &quot;α&quot;+1 is the disjoint union of &quot;α&quot; and a point.

As topological spaces, all the ordinals are Hausdorff and even normal. They are also totally disconnected (connected components are points), scattered (every non-empty subspace has an isolated point; in this case, just take the smallest element), zero-dimensional (the topology has a clopen basis: here, write an open interval (&quot;β&quot;,&quot;γ&quot;) as the union of the clopen intervals (&quot;β&quot;,&quot;γ&quot;&#x27;+1) = [&quot;β&quot;+1,&quot;γ&quot;&#x27;] for &quot;γ&quot;&#x27;&lt;&quot;γ&quot;). However, they are not extremally disconnected in general (there are open sets, for example the even numbers from ω, whose closure is not open).

The topological spaces ω1 and its successor ω1+1 are frequently used as textbook examples of uncountable topological spaces. For example, in the topological space ω1+1, the element ω1 is in the closure of the subset ω1 even though no sequence of elements in ω1 has the element ω1 as its limit: an element in ω1 is a countable set; for any sequence of such sets, the union of these sets is the union of countably many countable sets, so still countable; this union is an upper bound of the elements of the sequence, and therefore of the limit of the sequence, if it has one.

The space ω1 is first-countable but not second-countable, and ω1+1 has neither of these two properties, despite being compact. It is also worthy of note that any continuous function from ω1 to R (the real line) is eventually constant: so the Stone–Čech compactification of ω1 is ω1+1, just as its one-point compactification (in sharp contrast to ω, whose Stone–Čech compactification is much &quot;larger&quot; than ω).

=== Ordinal-indexed sequences ===
If &quot;α&quot; is a limit ordinal and &quot;X&quot; is a set, an &quot;α&quot;-indexed sequence of elements of &quot;X&quot; merely means a function from &quot;α&quot; to &quot;X&quot;. This concept, a transfinite sequence or ordinal-indexed sequence, is a generalization of the concept of a sequence. An ordinary sequence corresponds to the case &quot;α&quot; = ω.

If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, we say that an &quot;α&quot;-indexed sequence of elements of &quot;X&quot; &quot;converges&quot; to a limit &quot;x&quot; when it converges as a net, in other words, when given any neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; there is an ordinal &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;&quot;ι&quot; is in &quot;U&quot; for all &quot;ι&quot; ≥ &quot;β&quot;.

Ordinal-indexed sequences are more powerful than ordinary (ω-indexed) sequences to determine limits in topology: for example, ω1 is a limit point of ω1+1 (because it is a limit ordinal), and, indeed, it is the limit of the ω1-indexed sequence which maps any ordinal less than ω1 to itself: however, it is not the limit of any ordinary (ω-indexed) sequence in ω1, since any such limit is less than or equal to the union of its elements, which is a countable union of countable sets, hence itself countable.

However, ordinal-indexed sequences are not powerful enough to replace nets (or filters) in general: for example, on the Tychonoff plank (the product space formula_11), the corner point formula_12 is a limit point (it is in the closure) of the open subset formula_13, but it is not the limit of an ordinal-indexed sequence.

<text>A shipyard, also called a dockyard or boatyard, is a place where ships are built and repaired. These can be yachts, military vessels, cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships. Compared to shipyards, which are sometimes more involved with original construction, dockyards are sometimes more linked with maintenance and basing activities. The terms are routinely used interchangeably, in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles.

Countries with large shipbuilding industries include Australia, Brazil, China, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. The shipbuilding industry is more fragmented in Europe than in Asia where countries tend to have fewer, larger companies. Many naval vessels are built or maintained in shipyards owned or operated by the national government or navy.

Shipyards are constructed near the sea or tidal rivers to allow easy access for their ships. The United Kingdom, for example, has shipyards on many of its rivers.

The site of a large shipyard will contain many specialised cranes, dry docks, slipways, dust-free warehouses, painting facilities and extremely large areas for fabrication of the ships. After a ship&#x27;s useful life is over, it makes its final voyage to a ship-breaking yard, often on a beach in South Asia. Historically ship-breaking was carried out in drydock in developed countries, but high wages and environmental regulations have resulted in movement of the industry to third-world regions.

==History==
The oldest structure sometimes identified as a dockyard was built by the Indus Valley civilisation in the Harappan port city of Lothal (in present-day Gujarat, India).
Lothal&#x27;s dockyards connected to an ancient course of the Sabarmati river on the trade route between Harappan cities in Sindh and the peninsula of Saurashtra when the present-day surrounding Kutch desert formed a part of the Arabian Sea.

Lothal engineers accorded high priority to the creation of a dockyard and a warehouse to serve the purposes of maritime trade. The dock was built on the eastern flank of the town, and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order. It was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting, but provided access to ships at high tide as well.

The name of the ancient Greek city on the Gulf of Corinth, Naupactus, means &quot;shipyard&quot; (combination of the Greek words ναύς &quot;naus&quot;: &quot;ship, boat&quot;; and πήγνυμι &quot;pêgnumi&quot;, &quot;pegnymi&quot;: &quot;builder, fixer&quot;). Naupactus&#x27; reputation in this field extended back into legendary times – the site is traditionally identified by Greek authors such as Ephorus and Strabo as the place where a fleet was said to have been built by the legendary Heraclidae
to invade the Peloponnesus.

In the Spanish city of Barcelona, the Drassanes shipyards were active from at least the mid-13th century until the 18th century, although at times they served as a barracks for troops as well as an arsenal. During their time of operation the Drassanes were continuously changed, rebuilt and modified, but two original towers and part of the original eight construction-naves remain today. The site is currently a maritime museum.

From the 14th century, several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution, ships were the first items to be manufactured in a factory – in the Venice Arsenal of the Venetian Republic in present-day Italy. The Arsenal apparently mass-produced nearly one ship every day using pre-manufactured parts and assembly lines. At its height in the 16th century the enterprise employed 16,000 people.

Spain built component ships of the Great Armada of 1588 at ports such as Algeciras or Málaga.

<text>James Short FRS (10 June O.S. (21 June N.S.) 1710 – 14 June 1768) was a Scottish mathematician and manufacturer of optical instruments, principally telescopes. During his 35-year career as a telescope-maker he produced approximately 1,360 scientific instruments.

== Early life and education ==
Short was born in Edinburgh in 1710 to Margaret Grierson and William Short, a carpenter. When he was orphaned at about the age of 10, he was accepted into the Heriot&#x27;s Hospital, an orphanage, and at 12 transferred to the Royal High School where he excelled in the study of the classics. In 1726 he entered the University of Edinburgh to study divinity, however after being inspired by lectures given by professor of mathematics Colin Maclaurin, he transferred to astronomy and mathematics.

== Telescope manufacture ==
In 1732 Maclaurin gave Short access to use his rooms in the university to work on for experiments in the construction of telescopes. Such was the quality of Short&#x27;s instruments that in recognition of his skill he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society on 24 March 1737. In Short&#x27;s first telescopes the specula were made of glass, as suggested by James Gregory, however later he used metallic specula only, and thus succeeded in giving them true parabolic and elliptic shapes.

Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession, which he practised first in Edinburgh up until 1738, after which he transferred to London.

Almost all of Short&#x27;s telescopes were of the Gregorian form, and some of them even today retain their original high polish and sharp definition.

In 1736 Queen Caroline requested him to instruct her second son, William, in mathematics.

In March 1737 Short was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1758 became a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was a founder member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 1754.

Short died in Newington Butts, London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune from his profession.

<text>In chemistry and thermodynamics, the enthalpy of neutralization () is the change in enthalpy that occurs when one equivalent of an acid and a base undergo a neutralization reaction to form water and a salt. It is a special case of the enthalpy of reaction. It is defined as the energy released with the formation of 1 mole of water.
When a reaction is carried out under standard conditions at the temperature of 298 K (25 degrees Celsius) and 1 atm of pressure and one mole of water is formed, the heat released by the reaction is called the &quot;standard enthalpy of neutralization&quot; ().

The heat () released during a reaction is
:formula_1

where is the mass of the solution, is the specific heat capacity of the solution, and is the temperature change observed during the reaction. From this, the standard enthalpy change () is obtained by division with the amount of substance (in moles) involved.

:formula_2
When a strong acid, HA, reacts with a strong base, BOH, the reaction that occurs is
:&lt;chem&gt;H+ + OH^- -&gt; H2O&lt;/chem&gt; 
as the acid and the base are fully dissociated and neither the cation nor the anion are involved in the neutralization reaction. The enthalpy change for this reaction is -57.62 kJ/mol at 25 °C.

For weak acids or bases, the heat of neutralization is pH-dependent. In the absence of any added mineral acid or alkali, some heat is required for complete dissociation. The total heat evolved during neutralization will be smaller.

:e.g. formula_3 at 25°C

The heat of ionization for this reaction is equal to (–12 + 57.3) = 45.3 kJ/mol at 25 °C.

<text>Nord-du-Québec (; ) is the largest, but the least populous, of the seventeen administrative regions of Quebec, Canada.

Spread over nearly 14 degrees of latitude, north of the 49th parallel, the region covers on the Labrador Peninsula, making it larger than Alberta, and slightly smaller than British Columbia or Pakistan. It is just over half of the province&#x27;s total land area.

==History==
Nord-du-Québec possesses 3,644 archaeological sites known and listed by the Ministère de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition féminine (MCCCF), along La Grande Rivière basin, the Otish Mountains sector and in the coastal areas of Quaqtaq, near Ungava Bay. These sites are mostly of First Nations origin and bear witness to several thousands of years of occupation of the territory of the Cree and Inuit ancestors of the region.

Before 1912, the northernmost part of this region was part of the Ungava District of the Northwest Territories, and until 1987 it was referred to as Nouveau-Québec, or &quot;New Quebec&quot;.

== Geography ==
Nord-du-Québec lies entirely upon the Canadian Shield. It extends from 49°N latitude to beyond 62°N and is 98.4 percent public land. The region is bordered by Hudson Bay and James Bay in the west, Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay in the north, Labrador in the northeast, and the administrative regions of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Mauricie, Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, and Côte-Nord in the south and southeast.

Nord-du-Québec is part of the territory covered by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975; other regions covered (in part) by this Agreement include Côte-Nord, Mauricie and Abitibi-Témiscamingue administrative regions.

===Subdivisions===
Nord-du-Québec is divided for statistical and other purposes into three territories equivalent to a regional county municipality (TEs):
# Kativik (or Nunavik) north of the 55th parallel, predominantly Inuit
# Eeyou Istchee non-contiguously enclaved within Jamésie (with one community in Kativik), predominantly Cree
# Jamésie south of the 55th parallel

When the Grand Council of the Crees speaks of &quot;Eeyou Istchee&quot;, they refer to a much larger and contiguous traditional territory and homeland that covers much of Jamésie.

Jamésie, extending from the eastern shore of James Bay to the Otish Mountains of the Laurentian Plateau, is mainly boreal forest. Eeyou Istchee is largely enclaved within Jamésie, although one of its communities is slightly to the north of the 55th parallel and geographically enclaved within Kativik. Kativik has some boreal forest in its southern portion but is mainly tundra which covers the entire Ungava Peninsula.

From the Canada 2011 Census, Eeyou Istchee has a land area of and a population of 16,350; Jamésie has a land area of and a population of 14,139; Kativik has a land area of and a population of 12,090. The most populous community overall is the town of Chibougamau in Jamésie. The most populous community in Eeyou Istchee is Chisasibi, while the most populous community in Kativik is Kuujjuaq.

====Local government====
The administrative structure of Nord-du-Québec is divided between three equivalent territories to a regional municipality: Kativik, Eeyou Istchee, and Jamésie. At the local level exists five municipalities: The towns of Chibougamau (the largest town in this region), Chapais, Lebel-sur-Quévillon, and Matagami, and the special municipality of Eeyou Istchee James Bay, which was formerly the local municipality of Baie-James before a 2012 restructure of the government.

Kativik offers regional services to its 14 northern villages and associated Inuit reserved lands as well as the Naskapi village municipality of Kawawachikamach. Eeyou Istchee offers regional services to its 9 Cree village municipalities and their associated Cree reserved lands. The four towns of Jamésie are not covered by a regional government, and supply their own services. The special local municipality of Eeyou Istchee James Bay is governed jointly by the Eeyou Istchee James Bay Regional Government, which consists of 11 representatives from Eeyou Istche and 11 representatives from Jamésie.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Nord-du-Québec region had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of +2.6% from its 2016 population of 44,561. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. If the region were its own province, it would be larger than all other Canadian provinces except for Ontario and British Columbia.

The median age is 29.8, as opposed to 41.6 for all of Canada. It is the youngest region of Québec. 

Most residents (58.7%) spoke Indigenous languages as their mother tongue. The Cree-Innu languages were the mother tongue of 31.7%, followed by Inuktitut at 26.9%. From Canada&#x27;s official languages, French was the mother tongue of 29.9% of residents in 2021, while English was for 6.6%. 3.0% reported both English and a non-official language as their mother tongue, 0.4% reported both English and French as their first language, and 0.3% reported both French and a non-official language as their mother tongue.

As of 2021, Indigenous peoples comprised 68.5% of the population, and visible minorities contributed 1.9%. The largest visible minority groups in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean are Black (0.9%), Arab (0.3%), and Filipino (0.3%). 

In 2021, 72.2% of the population identified as Christian. 36.3% were Anglican, 24.1% were Catholic, and 6.2% were Pentecostal. 24.9% said they had no religious affiliation. Traditional North American Indigenous spirituality practitioners were the largest non-Christian religious minority, making up 1.9% of the population.

Counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnocultural ancestries were:


== Transportation and access ==
There is a limited network of roads in the Jamésie region which reaches most of the few, small communities. Most were constructed as part of the James Bay Project. The &quot;main road&quot; of the region is the long James Bay Road, a paved (albeit remote) extension of Route 109 from Matagami to Radisson. The long gravel Route du Nord connects the James Bay Road to Route 167 near Chibougamau. The gravel Trans-Taiga Road branches off the James Bay Road to Caniapiscau, the northernmost connecting road in eastern North America.

The few provincial routes are concentrated in the far south of the region, including Route 109 to Matagami, Route 113, which ends near Chibougamau, and Route 167 to Mistissini.

There are no roads to Nunavik from the south. There are isolated roads in and around villages, as well as an isolated road running from Raglan Mine to Deception Bay, connecting to Salluit. Access is limited to air travel, sea travel to coastal areas, or hiking great distances. All villages have their own airport, with the Kuujjuaq Airport functioning as a regional hub.

== Geographic hierarchy of census division ==

In the rightmost column, the total area adds up to 747161.23 rather than the correct 747161.22 due to rounding error.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

Frederick William II (; 25 September 1744 – 16 November 1797) was King of Prussia from 1786 until his death in 1797. He was also the prince-elector of Brandenburg and (through the Orange-Nassau inheritance of his grandfather) sovereign prince of the Canton of Neuchâtel. As a defensive reaction to the French Revolution, Frederick William II ended the German Dualism between Prussia and Austria. Domestically, he turned away from the enlightened style of government of his predecessor and introduced a tightened system of censorship and religious control. The king was an important patron of the arts especially in the field of music. As a skilled cellist he enjoyed the dedication of various cellocentric compositions by composers Mozart, Haydn, Boccherini, and Beethoven. He was also responsible for some of the most notable architecture in Prussia, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Marble Palace, and Orangery in the New Garden, Potsdam.

==Early life==
Frederick William was born in Berlin on 25 September 1744, the eldest son of the Prussian Prince Augustus William of Prussia (1722–1758) and Duchess Luise of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Initially, Frederick William was second in line to the Prussian throne after his father. Due to his childlessness, King Frederick II had designated his next younger brother Augustus William, Frederick William&#x27;s father, as Prince of Prussia in 1744.

Frederick William was born into a time of war, for Prussia had again been at war (1744–1745) with Austria since 10 August 1744. Since 1740, or the death of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Habsburg, Vienna had been without a male heir to the throne. Although Charles VI had appointed his daughter Maria Theresa as heir with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, this document contradicted the previously valid Salic law, which only provided for male heirs to the throne. Frederick II of Prussia took advantage of the Austrian succession crisis to annex Habsburg Silesia. He thus began the first of a total of three Silesian Wars which, with brief interruptions, were to last until 1763.

On 11 October 1744, Frederick William was baptised in the predecessor of today&#x27;s Berlin Cathedral. In addition to members of the Prussian royal family, Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor, Tsarina Elisabeth of Russia, Louis XV of France and the Swedish heir to the throne Adolf Frederick were chosen as godparents in keeping with his status. The choice of godparents also demonstrated the king&#x27;s attempt to isolate Austria in terms of alliance policy. These foreign rulers were not personally present at the baptism, but had themselves represented.

== Education ==
In 1747, King Frederick II removed his three-year-old nephew from the care of his family, who lived in the Berlin Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace and Oranienburg Palace. He had Frederick William brought to the Berlin Palace and decided on an education in the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment, selecting a tutor for his four-year-old nephew.

Nicolas de Béguelin was selected by the king to fulfill this role. Béguelin had studied law and mathematics, then worked at the Imperial Chamber Court in Wetzlar and had been in Prussian service since 1743. He had already come into personal contact with Frederick II and enjoyed his esteem. Béguelin strictly regulated the daily routine of the four- and five-year-old prince: in the morning, the prince learned German and French, the language of the European courts. At noon, he had to invite cavaliers of the court to be introduced to diplomatic manners. After lunch, the language lessons continued in written form, since he could already read and write at the age of five. Only then did he have time to play. But even at this time of day, he had to act out what he had learned with the help of puppets.

Frederick II constantly intervened in education. At the reception of the cavaliers at noon, for example, he demanded that Frederick William not be brought up to be modest and reserved. As a possible successor to the kingship, he was to gain respect among the country&#x27;s nobility through &quot;Dreistigkeit&quot; (audacity), in accordance with Frederick II&#x27;s will. The rather shy Frederick William could not meet these demands of his uncle. The high expectations that were placed on the child&#x27;s behaviour and willingness to perform on a daily basis left little room for carefree hours and child-friendly activities. If the prince did not feel like performing certain tasks or showed defiance, Béguelin would take away his favourite toy or even threaten to beat him.

Frederick William was taught mathematics, law, philosophy and history. Members of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, which under Frederick II brought together important, predominantly French scholars, repeatedly acted as educational mentors. The future king had a solid knowledge of Greek, Roman, Assyrian and Jewish history in particular. Occasionally Béguelin relaxed the lessons by taking the prince on excursions to Berlin manufactories, workshops and art studios. Dancing, fencing and riding were also on the programme. However, he did not receive an education that would have prepared Frederick William for the affairs of state of a reigning monarch.

In 1751, the king chose the well-read and highly educated Major Heinrich Adrian von Borcke for Frederick William&#x27;s military training. The 36-year-old count showed little pedagogical sensitivity. Reports that Borcke had to write regularly to Frederick II to report on the child&#x27;s progress show that Frederick William often behaved rebelliously and was punished for it with beatings. When this did not help either, Borcke forbade the prince to have contact with his younger brother Henry. Frederick II approved of this educational practice. On 19 August 1754, he demanded that Frederick William move from Berlin to Potsdam, to his court. The king stated that the aim was to transform Frederick William&#x27;s sensitive and reserved nature:

&quot;As he (Frederick William) is somewhat shy, I have told all who come to me to tease him in order to make him speak. I am convinced that he will not be embarrassed in front of anyone in the near future.&quot;

- Letter from King Frederick II to his younger brother Augustus William of Prussia

== Prince of Prussia ==

Frederick William&#x27;s youth was overshadowed by the experiences of the Third Silesian War and Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763).

The war exacerbated tensions between King Frederick II and Frederick William&#x27;s father, Augustus William, who had been presumptive heir to the throne as Prince of Prussia since 1744. In the autumn of 1757, Frederick II dishonourably dismissed his brother from the Prussian Army over accusations of multiple failures. Some historians suggest that Frederick deliberately used his brother as a scapegoat to distract attention from his own failures as a general, and later transferred his contempt for the younger brother to Frederick William. In fact, Frederick II had treated his nephew no more viciously than those around him before Augustus William&#x27;s death.

After the death of Frederick William&#x27;s father, it was not until December 1758 that both Frederick William and his brother Henry were able to visit King Frederick II in his winter camp in Torgau. On this occasion Frederick II confirmed his nephew&#x27;s position as heir to the throne and on 13 December 1758 bestowed on him the title and name Prince of Prussia. In this way Frederick II signalled to the outside world that Prussia&#x27;s existence was secure through the heir. In fact, however, Prussia faced complete dissolution several times during this war. The Prussian court was often on the run or had to entrench itself in the fortress of Magdeburg.

In the final stages of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Frederick II viewed the popularity of the heir to the throne with the soldiers with concern, as it threatened to overshadow his own military fame. In 1762, the Prince of Prussia took part in the Siege of Schweidnitz and the Battle of Burkersdorf. Although Frederick II praised him for his bravery and appointed him commander of a Potsdam infantry regiment, over time the relationship between the monarch and his heir to the throne cooled noticeably.

The Seven Years&#x27; War finally ended with the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763. Prussia had been able to assert itself as a great power and defend Silesia, but had accepted immense economic and cultural damage in return. Plagues, hunger and disease caused the loss of over 300,000 civilians in Prussia alone.

=== Conflict with Frederick II ===

Frederick II aimed at publicly humiliating his heir to the throne. He expressed his regret that his other nephew, Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, could not succeed him on the throne. The art historian Alfred Hagemann interprets this behaviour as meaning that Frederick wanted to enhance his own image in history by deliberately dismantling his own successor.

At the latest, the two forced marriages to Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and then Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, arranged by Frederick II led to the tense relationship between king and crown prince. Frederick William began to distance himself more and more from Frederick II in terms of character: While King Frederick II lived in a purely male world, the crown prince built up an emotional and bourgeois love life with his mistress Wilhelmine Encke from the 1760s onwards. While Frederick II was critical of religious practice, Frederick William II was a devout Protestant. While Frederick II was only a patron of French culture, Frederick William II as king supported German music and theatre. While Frederick II withdrew into small elite circles, Frederick William II as king sought representative appearances. Frederick William was a man of his time, interested in spiritualism, clairvoyance and astrology, which would have repelled his predecessor.

Frederick II&#x27;s contempt for his successor is also evidenced by the Potsdam apartment assigned to the &quot;Prince of Prussia&quot; on the corner of Neuer Markt. Given his high position, he lived there very cramped amidst the burghers. The building on Neuer Markt, known today as the &quot;Kabinettshaus&quot;, had originally been erected in 1753 for the country preacher Krumbholz and had to be makeshiftly converted into the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace in 1764. In the rented neighbouring house at Schwertfegerstrasse 8, the future Prussian King Frederick William III was born on 3 August 1770. In the house, the crown prince invited Potsdam&#x27;s distinguished society to concerts and balls, which, however, were soon moved to the old orangery at the Lustgarten due to lack of space.

Frederick&#x27;s lifestyle and conception of the state differed fundamentally from those of his nephew. Frederick lived according to the principle that the ruler should be the &quot;first servant&quot; of the state. To this end, he devoted himself in depth to politics, government work and state philosophy, sometimes attending to the smallest details. He often changed his advisors and officials and was reluctant to delegate tasks and power to others. He ruled as an autocrat until the end.

Although Frederick II gave his nephew an educational upbringing, the king failed - likely through malice - to introduce the heir to the throne to political processes and contexts. He was only allowed to attend the sessions of the Berlin Court of Appeal. Frederick II, however, forbade his ministers to grant Frederick William insights into day-to-day political business. Due to his upbringing, he possessed solid knowledge only in constitutional law, military matters and the arts.

=== Contemporary account of Frederick William by John Moore ===

== Reign ==
=== Domestic politics ===
Frederick William&#x27;s accession to the throne (17 August 1786) was followed by a series of measures for lightening the burdens of the people, reforming the oppressive French system of tax-collecting introduced by Frederick, and encouraging trade by the diminution of customs dues and the making of roads and canals. This gave the new king much popularity with the masses; the educated classes were pleased by Frederick William&#x27;s reversal of his uncle&#x27;s preference for the French language and the promotion of the German language, with the admission of German writers to the Prussian Academy of Arts, and by the active encouragement given to schools and universities. Frederick William also terminated his predecessor&#x27;s state monopolies for coffee and tobacco and the sugar monopoly. Under his reign the codification known as &quot;Allgemeines Preußisches Landrecht&quot;, initiated by Frederick II, continued and was completed in 1794.

===Foreign policies ===
In the 18th century, the field of foreign policy was considered the highest statecraft and the &quot;main business&quot; of an absolutist prince. Accordingly, Frederick William II was best prepared in this political area. Officially, he alone decided on war and peace. In terms of alliance politics, Prussia was in a difficult situation when Frederick II died: the Austro-Russian Alliance (1781), the unreliability of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Franco-Austrian Alliance in 1756 led to Prussia&#x27;s foreign policy isolation. Frederick William II&#x27;s goal of consolidating the kingdom&#x27;s position as a major power, which it had achieved under Frederick II, was therefore seriously endangered from the start. Above all, Frederick William&#x27;s Minister of War Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg demanded that the king not wait for a change in the European alliance system, but rather actively bring it about.

The transatlantic and European revolutions formed the background of Frederick Wilhelm&#x27;s foreign policy. In his world, which was essentially the world of the Ancien Régime, they initially only appeared to Prussia as distant rumblings of thunder. However, the consequences of the upheavals associated with the French Revolution in particular could not have been predicted at the time.

===Personal life ===

Frederick II selected Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick as Frederick William&#x27;s new wife, and had them married in 1765. This unhappy marriage ended after only four years during which both spouses had been unfaithful. Frederick II, granted a divorce reluctantly. Frederick William was then married to Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1769 which lasted until his death in 1797. From 1769 to 1782 Wilhelmine Enke was his mistress. Following this relationship she became his closest confidant and advisor. In 1794–1797 he had a palace built for her on the Pfaueninsel. Frederick William was involved with two more mistresses during his life, both conducted through morganatic marriage, which were also bigamous, since his wife queen Frederica Louisa was still alive. The first was with Elisabeth Amalie, Gräfin von Voß, Gräfin von Ingenheim in 1787, and the second with Sophie Juliane Gräfin von Dönhoff. His favourite son —with Wilhelmine Enke— was Graf Alexander von der Mark. His daughter from Sophie Juliane was Countess Julie of Brandenburg (4 January 1793, Neuchâtel – 29 January 1848, Vienna), who later married Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Anhalt-Köthen.

=== Patron of the Arts ===

Frederick William was a passionate supporter of the arts. Upon ascending to the throne Frederick William turned the cultural focus of the country away from the French culture that Frederick II had established. For instance, the French Theatre was transformed into the National Theater on Gendarmenmarkt where performances of German opera and plays were performed. During its opening, Frederick William declared, &quot;We are Germans, and we intend to remain so.&quot; The Royal Opera played works by Johann Frederick Reichardt and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Berlin developed into a cultural center of the Classical era, competing with Paris, Dresden, and Vienna. The king himself was a passionate cellist. When government affairs allowed, he spent about 2 hours daily with the instrument. With 70 permanently employed musicians, the king&#x27;s court orchestra was considered one of the largest in Europe.

Buildings constructed under his reign were the Marmorpalais in Potsdam and the world-famous Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

===Mysticism ===
It is worth mentioning another distinctly characteristic inclination of Frederick William II, namely, occultism. At the end of the 18th century, the circles of the bourgeoisie and the nobility, unsettled by the Enlightenment, were in search of mystical Christian experiences. Since the official church could not alleviate this uncertainty, they turned to various religious orders, including the Rosicrucians. During this time, the Rosicrucians believed they were chosen by God to free people&#x27;s souls from sin, lust, and pride.

Deeply religious Crown Prince Frederick William was enthused by these ideals and joined the Order in 1781. Two of the leading representatives of the order, Johann Christoph von Wöllner and Johann Rudolf von Bischoffwerder, managed to convince the crown prince of their teachings. By highlighting the supposed godlessness of his previous lifestyle, which had been unconcerned with matters of sexuality, they saw the opportunity to displace his most significant competitor, Frederick William&#x27;s Mistress, Wilhelmine Enke. In reality, Frederick William gave up his sexual relationship with the future countess but remained closely connected to her in a friendly manner.

== Death and legacy ==
In early October 1797, Frederick William II withdrew from the Berlin court life. He never left the Marmorpalais in Potsdam again. Only a few confidants, such as Countess Lichtenau, as well as French nobles who had fled before the French Revolution, gathered around the dying king. On 9 November 1797 Frederick William handed over the government affairs to his son because he was no longer physically capable of doing so due to shortness of breath and immobility. During a seizure, Frederick William II died on 16 November 1797 at 8:58 a.m., at the age of 53, in the &quot;paneled writing cabinet&quot; of the Marmorpalais.

The burial of the deceased king took place on 11 December 1797, with a simple procession. Eight major generals carried the coffin. After the sermon, the service concluded with a cannon salute. The court society mourned for six weeks, during which time amusements such as theater and music events were forbidden both at the court and in the country. Additional religious services were held.

Frederick William&#x27;s eulogy was published in the &quot;Berlinische Zeitung&quot; on 14 December 1797:

&quot;Frederick William completed the great legislative work begun by Frederick . And if this were the only deed that glorified his regal life: how surely must he achieve immortality through it alone! - He will forever live in the annals of our history as the happy enlarger of his country. The grandchildren of our new brothers in Franconia and on the Vistula will always celebrate the day when they became Prussians, and humanity itself can celebrate him because these acquisitions were not the result of terrible wars [...]. His contemporaries called him &#x27;The Kind One,&#x27; and centuries later, people will still joyfully appreciate his benevolent deeds. He built, benefiting and enhancing, for posterity. Thanks to him, several of our provinces received paved and sturdy roads, which our country had been lacking until then (Chausseen in Westphalia, in Silesia, in Magdeburg, in Brandenburg). Elsewhere, he elevated the convenience of transportation and the advantage of residents through canals (in the Ruppin area, after the rebuilding of the burned-down city). Many places and regions, especially the capital of the empire, were equipped by him with substantial residential buildings and palaces, with beneficial institutions of all kinds (just to name a few: the expansion of the Charité, the veterinary school, the construction of the Marienkirchthurm, the construction of several gates and city walls, an iron and other bridges, the construction of new city prisons, etc.), as well as admirable monuments. As long as there is still a sense of nature and a taste for art among the inhabitants of Berlin, that is, as long as Berlin exists, the name of the king cannot fade, who, at the end of the most beautiful street and at the entrance to the most beautiful pleasure forest, had the magnificent gate erected, which so boldly opposes the Greek architectural works.&quot;

Frederick William was interred in a vault of the old Berlin Cathedral. Countess Lichtenau, who had cared for the dying king, was no longer allowed to see the deceased and was placed under house arrest. Frederick William III had the father&#x27;s despised lover sent into exile in Glogau and most of her wealth confiscated.

Dieter Brozat reported in &quot;Der Berliner Dom und die Hohenzollerngruft&quot; (1985) that the sarcophagus of Frederick William II in the Hohenzollern vault was heavily damaged during World War II. This is attributed to Soviet looting, and incendiary bomb damage. During the reconstruction of the cathedral, parts of a skeleton were found, suggesting embalming of the body. Brozat believes these remains to be those of Frederick William II.

<doc id="213670" wikidata="Q1102161" url="?curid=213670" title="Jungle music">
<text>Jungle is a genre of electronic music that developed out of the UK rave scene and Jamaican sound system culture in the 1990s. Emerging from breakbeat hardcore, the style is characterised by rapid breakbeats, heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples, and synthesised effects, combined with the deep basslines, melodies, and vocal samples found in dub, reggae and dancehall, as well as hip hop and funk. Many producers frequently sampled the &quot;Amen break&quot; or other breakbeats from funk and jazz recordings. Jungle was a direct precursor to the drum and bass genre which emerged in the mid-1990s.

==Origins==
The breakbeat hardcore scene of the early 1990s was beginning to fragment by 1992 and 1993, with different influences becoming less common together in tracks. The piano and uplifting vocal style that was prevalent in breakbeat hardcore started to lay down the foundations of 4-beat/happy hardcore, whilst tracks with dark-themed samples and industrial-style stabs had emerged from late 1992 and named darkcore. Reggae samples and reggae-influenced tracks had been a feature of many breakbeat hardcore tracks since 1990, particularly from producers such as Shut Up and Dance, however Ibiza Records, and the Rebel MC were arguably the first to bring the sound system influence solidly into releases. The track &quot;We Are I.E.&quot; by Lennie De Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the foundations for jungle with its ragga bassline.

The infiltration of hardcore B-boys into the rave scene was catalyst for &quot;the messy birth-pangs of Britain&#x27;s very own equivalent to US hip hop: jungle.&quot; The UK B-boy&#x27;s removal from American racial tensions made hip-hop&#x27;s sample and beat-making more attractive than the &quot;protest side of rap,&quot; and spurred on their interest in the rave scene. Alongside their &#x27;sampladelic&#x27; taste, raving B-boys&#x27; use of MDMA fueled the more hyper sound that was passed down to jungle, even after the drug was left for marijuana.

During 1992 and 1993, the phrases &quot;jungle techno&quot; and &quot;hardcore jungle&quot; proliferated to describe that shift of the music from breakbeat hardcore to jungle. The sound was championed at clubs such as AWOL, Roast, and Telepathy, by DJs such as DJ Ron, DJ Hype, DJ Randall, Mickey Finn, DJ Rap, and Kenny Ken, record labels Moving Shadow, V Recordings, Suburban Base, and Renk, and on pirate radio stations such as Kool FM (regarded as being the most instrumental station in the development of jungle) but also Don FM, Rush, and Rude FM.

Tracks would span breakbeat styles, particularly with darkcore, with notable releases including &quot;Darkage&quot; by DJ Solo, &quot;Valley of the Shadows&quot; by Origin Unknown, &quot;Set Me Free&quot; by Potential Bad Boy, &quot;28 Gun Bad Boy&quot; by A Guy Called Gerald, &quot;Crackman&quot; by DJ Ron, &quot;A London Sumtin&quot; by Code 071, &quot;Learning from My Brother&quot; by Family of Intelligence, &quot;Lion of Judah&quot; by X Project, and &quot;Be Free&quot; by Noise Factory.

Techniques and styles could be traced to such a vast group of influencers, each adding their own little elements. According to Simon Reynolds, jungle was &quot;Britain&#x27;s very own equivalent to US hip-hop. That said, you could equally make the case that jungle is a raved-up, digitised offshoot of Jamaican reggae. Musically, jungle&#x27;s spatialised production, bass quake pressure and battery of extreme sonic effects, make it a sort of postmodern dub music on steroids.&quot; This is an example of the effects of the sonic diaspora and the wide influence musical genres have; Jungle is where these different Black Atlantic genres converge. Reynolds noted the audience of the genre evolved alongside the music itself; going from a &quot;sweaty, shirtless white teenager, grinning and gurning&quot; to a &quot;head nodding, stylishly dressed black twenty something with hooded-eyes, holding a spliff in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other&quot;. Jungle also served as &quot;a site for a battle between contesting notions of blackness&quot;.

==Rise and popularity==

Jungle reached the peak of its popularity between 1994 and 1995. At this stage, the genre was achieving a number of UK top 40 hits, including &quot;Incredible&quot; by M-Beat featuring General Levy, and spawned a series of CD compilations such as &quot;Jungle Mania&quot; and &quot;Jungle Hits&quot;. Controversy raged over the success of &quot;Incredible&quot; when Levy reportedly made comments in the media that he was &quot;running jungle at the moment&quot;. Although Levy always argued that his comments were misinterpreted, this did not fail to stop a boycott of the single amongst a group of DJs that were dubbed as the &quot;Jungle Committee&quot;. Labels such as Ibiza, 3rd Party and Kemet were prolific in their releases.

Having previously been confined to pirate radio, legal stations woke up to jungle from 1994. London&#x27;s Kiss 100 launched its &quot;Givin&#x27; It Up&quot; show in early 1994 and featured DJs on rotation including Kenny Ken Jumpin Jack Frost, DJ Randall, DJ Rap, and Mickey Finn. A year later, the UK&#x27;s nationwide broadcaster BBC Radio 1 finally gave jungle a platform on its &quot;One in the Jungle&quot; weekly show.

Major labels such as Sony and BMG were signing deals with artists including A Guy Called Gerald, Kemet, and DJ Ron. Of these, Roni Size and 4hero would achieve wider commercial success as drum and bass artists, but continued to release more underground jungle tracks — the latter adopting the alias Tom &amp; Jerry to continue to release rare groove sampling dancefloor-oriented jungle. The underground classic &quot;Burial&quot; by Leviticus would see a major release on FFRR Records.

Jungle music, as a scene, was unable to decide whether it wanted to be recognised in the mainstream or if it wanted to avoid misrepresentation. This manifested in the cooperation of jungle artists and small record labels. Small record labels worked to provide more autonomy to the music artists in return for their business and jungle music was proliferated by pirate stations in underground networks and clubs. Whilst the media would in part feed off jungle music success, it also perpetuated negative stereotypes about the scene as being violent. The seminal 1994 documentary &quot;A London Some &#x27;Ting Dis&quot;, chronicled the growing jungle scene and interviewed producers, DJs, and ravers to counter this perception.

1996 and 1997 saw a less reggae-influenced sound and a darker, grittier, and more sinister soundscape. Hip-hop and jazz-influenced tracks dominated the clubs in this period. Dillinja, Roni Size, Die, Hype, Zinc, Alex Reece and Krust were instrumental in the transition of the jungle sound to drum and bass. By the end of 1998, the genre&#x27;s sound had changed forms significantly from the sound heard earlier in the decade.

===Popular subgenres===
====Ragga jungle====
Ragga jungle is a fusion genre that combines jungle with a heavy reggae influence. It would become a major subgenre during 1994 and 1995, with popular tracks such as &quot;Incredible&quot; by M-Beat featuring General Levy, &quot;Original Nuttah&quot; by UK Apachi and Shy FX, &quot;Sound Murderer / RIP&quot; by Remarc, &quot;Limb by Limb&quot; by Hitman featuring Cutty Ranks, and &quot;Code Red / Champion DJ&quot; by Conquering Lion.

====Jump-up====
In 1995, jump-up would also become a popular subgenre that came out of hardstep, with influences of various kinds of sound experiments, most importantly the bass line. Popular tracks of this subgenre include &quot;Dred Bass&quot; by Dead Dred, &quot;Super Sharp Shooter&quot; by DJ Zinc, &quot;This Style&quot; by Shy FX, &quot;R.I.P&quot; (DJ Hype Remix) by Remarc and DJ Zinc&#x27;s remix of the Fugees&#x27; &quot;Ready or Not&quot;. The genre would later regain popularity in the early 2000s with new productions by artists such as Shimon &amp; Andy C, Bad Company, DJ Hazard and Pendulum.

==Sociocultural context==
The post-Thatcherite United Kingdom of the early 1990s had left many young people, particularly London&#x27;s lower-class urban youth, disenfranchised and disillusioned with a seemingly crumbling societal structure. Jungle reflected these feelings, as it was a notably more dark, less euphoric style of music than many of the other styles popular at raves. The music was much more popular with black British youths than other rave styles, such as techno, even though it was heavily influenced by these other rave styles, including those from the United States. 

Jungle music was also seen as &quot;England&#x27;s answer to hip-hop&quot;, aimed at breaking down racial boundaries and promoting unification through its multiculturalism by drawing from different cultures and attracting mixed crowds at raves. Jungle&#x27;s rhythm-as-melody style overturned the dominance of melody-over-rhythm in the hierarchy of Western music, adding to its radical nature.

Moreover, the greater accessibility to sampling technology allowed young people to create music in their homes by incorporating their own sampling and experiences, rather than needing a grand recording studio.

Characterised by the breakbeats and multi-tiered rhythms, Jungle drew support not only from British b-boys who got swept up into the rave scene, but also from reggae, dancehall, electro and rap fans alike. Simon Reynolds described it as causing fear and &quot;for many ravers, too funky to dance&quot; yet the club scene enjoyed every second.

== Etymology==
The origin of the word jungle is one of discussion. Rebel MC is often noted for having popularised the term, and in Simon Reynolds&#x27; book &quot;Energy Flash&quot;, MC Navigator is quoted as attributing the word to him. Others such as MC Five-O attribute it to MC Moose, whilst Rob Playford (of Moving Shadow) attributes it to MC Mad P (of Top Buzz). Some thought of this term as empowering, an assertion of the blackness of the music and its subculture, inverting the racist history of the term &quot;jungle music&quot;.

==Notable releases==
Notable releases include: &quot;Burial&quot; by Leviticus, &quot;Dangerous&quot; by DJ Ron, &quot;Lover to Lover / Maximum Style&quot; by Tom &amp; Jerry, &quot;Original Nuttah&quot; by Shy FX, &quot;All the Crew Big Up&quot; by Roni Size &amp; DJ Die, &quot;Incredible / Sweet Love&quot; by M-Beat, &quot;The Helicopter Tune&quot; by Deep Blue, &quot;Super Sharp Shooter&quot; by DJ Zinc, &quot;Sovereign Melody / Lion Heart&quot; by Dillinja, &quot;Everyman&quot; by Kenny Ken, &quot;The Victory / Lovable&quot; by DJ Dextrous, &quot;Bad Ass&quot; by Aphrodite, &quot;The Lighter&quot; by DJ SS, and &quot;Tiger Style&quot; by DJ Hype.

==Crossover with drum and bass==

The term &quot;jungle&quot; is often used as a synonym for drum and bass, particularly in the United States. More commonly, jungle is viewed as the originating point for drum and bass, with the progressive changes brought by artists in the late 1990s serving as the point of diversion (some examples being Trace &amp; Ed Rush, LTJ Bukem, Photek, Total Science, Goldie and Optical).
During this time, a false dichotomy was established between drum and bass and jungle, with the former for white ravers and the latter for black ravers. The sub-genre of drum and bass developed to be quicker, more industrial, less danceable yet was seen as more &#x27;accessible and commercial&#x27; than jungle, as cited in an article by &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1996. 

In &quot;Black Music in Britain in the 21st Century&quot;, written by Julia Toppin in 2023, she explains, &quot;the process of modifying jungle&#x27;s name can be viewed as an &#x27;act of resignifying the otherness&#x27; to disassociate it from black people and the racist media narratives containing race, drugs, and violence with jungle music and the scene.&quot; The jungle scene had always been portrayed in a negative light due to its affiliation with the rave scene and especially because of the black people associated with the music. 

The security and drug incidents at jungle events typically seemed to attract more police attention than other EDM genres, though the same trouble would happen in any other raves attended by predominately white audiences. With the emergence of drum and bass, the previous biases against jungle intensified while drum and bass&#x27;s popularity grew rapidly in mainstream media. In her article, Toppin highlights the sonic marginalization that occurred during the late 1990s, with black jungle ravers declined entry at night clubs and DJs being shadow-banned from playing jungle at venues. This would lead to jungle&#x27;s return to the underground at the end of the decade.

==Re-emergent jungle scene==

A thriving underground movement producing and developing tracks in the style of the 1990s and some original (though mostly mainstream drum and bass) jungle producers have noticed this new enthusiasm for the original sound. Shy FX, for example, launched the Digital Soundboy label in 2005 to put out more jungle. The UK is still home to a thriving jungle scene. Frequent jungle nights at the Corsica Studios has been pivotal to the continued success of the genre. The scene has grown with new producers such as Forest Drive West, Tim Reaper, Dead Man&#x27;s Chest and Sully.

The early to mid-2000s saw a jungle revival in the emerging drum-funk subgenre, with labels such as Scientific Wax, Bassbin Records and Paradox Music pushing for a more breaks orientated sound. Technicality and Bassbin events in London were spearheading this return to more traditional elements of jungle music.

One of the scene&#x27;s originators, Congo Natty, continued to release jungle music throughout the 2000s, culminating in the 2013 album &quot;Jungle Revolution&quot;.

In 2018, Chase &amp; Status produced an album exploring jungle sounds, &quot;RTRN II JUNGLE&quot;.

<text>In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods ( ) are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the Euler method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of simultaneous nonlinear equations. These methods were developed around 1900 by the German mathematicians Carl Runge and Wilhelm Kutta.

==The Runge–Kutta method==
The most widely known member of the Runge–Kutta family is generally referred to as &quot;RK4&quot;, the &quot;classic Runge–Kutta method&quot; or simply as &quot;the Runge–Kutta method&quot;.

Let an initial value problem be specified as follows:

:formula_1

Here formula_2 is an unknown function (scalar or vector) of time formula_3, which we would like to approximate; we are told that formula_4, the rate at which formula_2 changes, is a function of formula_3 and of formula_2 itself. At the initial time formula_8 the corresponding formula_2 value is formula_10. The function formula_11 and the initial conditions formula_8, formula_10 are given.

Now we pick a step-size &quot;h&quot; &gt; 0 and define:

:formula_14

for &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., using
:formula_15
(&quot;Note: the above equations have different but equivalent definitions in different texts.&quot;)

Here formula_16 is the RK4 approximation of formula_17, and the next value (formula_16) is determined by the present value (formula_19) plus the weighted average of four increments, where each increment is the product of the size of the interval, &quot;h&quot;, and an estimated slope specified by function &quot;f&quot; on the right-hand side of the differential equation.
* formula_20 is the slope at the beginning of the interval, using formula_21 (Euler&#x27;s method);
* formula_22 is the slope at the midpoint of the interval, using formula_21 and formula_24;
* formula_25 is again the slope at the midpoint, but now using formula_21 and formula_27;
* formula_28 is the slope at the end of the interval, using formula_21 and formula_30.

In averaging the four slopes, greater weight is given to the slopes at the midpoint. If formula_11 is independent of formula_2, so that the differential equation is equivalent to a simple integral, then RK4 is Simpson&#x27;s rule.

The RK4 method is a fourth-order method, meaning that the local truncation error is on the order of formula_33, while the total accumulated error is on the order of formula_34.

In many practical applications the function formula_11 is independent of formula_3 (so called autonomous system, or time-invariant system, especially in physics), and their increments are not computed at all and not passed to function formula_11, with only the final formula for formula_38 used.

==Explicit Runge–Kutta methods==
The family of explicit Runge–Kutta methods is a generalization of the RK4 method mentioned above. It is given by
:formula_39
where
:formula_40
:(&quot;Note: the above equations may have different but equivalent definitions in some texts.&quot;)

To specify a particular method, one needs to provide the integer &quot;s&quot; (the number of stages), and the coefficients &quot;aij&quot; (for 1 ≤ &quot;j&quot; &lt; &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;), &quot;bi&quot; (for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;s&quot;) and &quot;ci&quot; (for &quot;i&quot; = 2, 3, ..., &quot;s&quot;). The matrix [&quot;aij&quot;] is called the &quot;Runge–Kutta matrix&quot;, while the &quot;bi&quot; and &quot;ci&quot; are known as the &quot;weights&quot; and the &quot;nodes&quot;. These data are usually arranged in a mnemonic device, known as a &quot;Butcher tableau&quot; (after John C. Butcher):

A Taylor series expansion shows that the Runge–Kutta method is consistent if and only if
:formula_41
There are also accompanying requirements if one requires the method to have a certain order &quot;p&quot;, meaning that the local truncation error is O(&quot;hp&quot;+1). These can be derived from the definition of the truncation error itself. For example, a two-stage method has order 2 if &quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;b&quot;2 = 1, &quot;b&quot;2&quot;c&quot;2 = 1/2, and &quot;b&quot;2&quot;a&quot;21 = 1/2. Note that a popular condition for determining coefficients is 
:formula_42
This condition alone, however, is neither sufficient, nor necessary for consistency.
In general, if an explicit formula_43-stage Runge–Kutta method has order formula_44, then it can be proven that the number of stages must satisfy formula_45 and if formula_46, then formula_47.
However, it is not known whether these bounds are &quot;sharp&quot; in all cases. In some cases, it is proven that the bound cannot be achieved. For instance, Butcher proved that for formula_48, there is no explicit method with formula_49 stages. Butcher also proved that for formula_50, there is no explicit Runge-Kutta method with formula_51 stages. In general, however, it remains an open problem what the precise minimum number of stages formula_43 is for an explicit Runge–Kutta method to have order formula_44. Some values which are known are:
:formula_54
The provable bound above then imply that we can not find methods of orders formula_55 that require fewer stages than the methods we already know for these orders. The work of Butcher also proves that 7th and 8th order methods have a minimum of 9 and 11 stages, respectively. An example of an explicit method of order 6 with 7 stages can be found in Ref. Explicit methods of order 7 with 9 stages and explicit methods of order 8 with 11 stages are also known. See Refs. for a summary.

===Examples===
The RK4 method falls in this framework. Its tableau is

A slight variation of &quot;the&quot; Runge–Kutta method is also due to Kutta in 1901 and is called the 3/8-rule. The primary advantage this method has is that almost all of the error coefficients are smaller than in the popular method, but it requires slightly more FLOPs (floating-point operations) per time step. Its Butcher tableau is

However, the simplest Runge–Kutta method is the (forward) Euler method, given by the formula formula_56. This is the only consistent explicit Runge–Kutta method with one stage. The corresponding tableau is

===Second-order methods with two stages===
An example of a second-order method with two stages is provided by the explicit midpoint method:
:formula_57
The corresponding tableau is

The midpoint method is not the only second-order Runge–Kutta method with two stages; there is a family of such methods, parameterized by α and given by the formula

:formula_58

Its Butcher tableau is

In this family, formula_59 gives the midpoint method, formula_60 is Heun&#x27;s method, and formula_61 is Ralston&#x27;s method.

==Use==
As an example, consider the two-stage second-order Runge–Kutta method with α = 2/3, also known as Ralston method. It is given by the tableau

with the corresponding equations

:formula_62

This method is used to solve the initial-value problem
:formula_63
with step size &quot;h&quot; = 0.025, so the method needs to take four steps.

The method proceeds as follows:

The numerical solutions correspond to the underlined values.

==Adaptive Runge–Kutta methods==
Adaptive methods are designed to produce an estimate of the local truncation error of a single Runge–Kutta step. This is done by having two methods, one with order formula_44 and one with order formula_65. These methods are interwoven, i.e., they have common intermediate steps. Thanks to this, estimating the error has little or negligible computational cost compared to a step with the higher-order method.

During the integration, the step size is adapted such that the estimated error stays below a user-defined threshold: If the error is too high, a step is repeated with a lower step size; if the error is much smaller, the step size is increased to save time. This results in an (almost), optimal step size, which saves computation time. Moreover, the user does not have to spend time on finding an appropriate step size.

The lower-order step is given by
:formula_66
where formula_67 are the same as for the higher-order method. Then the error is
:formula_68
which is formula_69. 
The Butcher tableau for this kind of method is extended to give the values of formula_70:

The Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method has two methods of orders 5 and 4. Its extended Butcher tableau is:

However, the simplest adaptive Runge–Kutta method involves combining Heun&#x27;s method, which is order 2, with the Euler method, which is order 1. Its extended Butcher tableau is:

Other adaptive Runge–Kutta methods are the Bogacki–Shampine method (orders 3 and 2), the Cash–Karp method and the Dormand–Prince method (both with orders 5 and 4).

==Nonconfluent Runge–Kutta methods==
A Runge–Kutta method is said to be &quot;nonconfluent&quot; if all the formula_71 are distinct.

==Runge–Kutta–Nyström methods==

Runge–Kutta–Nyström methods are specialized Runge–Kutta methods that are optimized for second-order differential equations. A general Runge–Kutta–Nyström method for a second-order ODE system

formula_72

with order formula_43 is with the form 

formula_74

which forms a Butcher table with the form

formula_75

Two fourth-order explicit RKN methods are given by the following Butcher tables:

formula_76
formula_77

These two schemes also have the symplectic-preserving properties when the original equation is derived from a conservative classical mechanical system, i.e. when 

formula_78

for some scalar function formula_79. 

==Implicit Runge–Kutta methods==
All Runge–Kutta methods mentioned up to now are explicit methods. Explicit Runge–Kutta methods are generally unsuitable for the solution of stiff equations because their region of absolute stability is small; in particular, it is bounded.
This issue is especially important in the solution of partial differential equations.

The instability of explicit Runge–Kutta methods motivates the development of implicit methods. An implicit Runge–Kutta method has the form

:formula_39
where
:formula_81 

The difference with an explicit method is that in an explicit method, the sum over &quot;j&quot; only goes up to &quot;i&quot; − 1. This also shows up in the Butcher tableau: the coefficient matrix formula_82 of an explicit method is lower triangular. In an implicit method, the sum over &quot;j&quot; goes up to &quot;s&quot; and the coefficient matrix is not triangular, yielding a Butcher tableau of the form

:formula_83
See Adaptive Runge-Kutta methods above for the explanation of the formula_84 row.

The consequence of this difference is that at every step, a system of algebraic equations has to be solved. This increases the computational cost considerably. If a method with &quot;s&quot; stages is used to solve a differential equation with &quot;m&quot; components, then the system of algebraic equations has &quot;ms&quot; components. This can be contrasted with implicit linear multistep methods (the other big family of methods for ODEs): an implicit &quot;s&quot;-step linear multistep method needs to solve a system of algebraic equations with only &quot;m&quot; components, so the size of the system does not increase as the number of steps increases.

===Examples===
The simplest example of an implicit Runge–Kutta method is the backward Euler method:

:formula_85

The Butcher tableau for this is simply:

:formula_86

This Butcher tableau corresponds to the formulae

:formula_87

which can be re-arranged to get the formula for the backward Euler method listed above.

Another example for an implicit Runge–Kutta method is the trapezoidal rule. Its Butcher tableau is:

:formula_88

The trapezoidal rule is a collocation method (as discussed in that article). All collocation methods are implicit Runge–Kutta methods, but not all implicit Runge–Kutta methods are collocation methods.

The Gauss–Legendre methods form a family of collocation methods based on Gauss quadrature. A Gauss–Legendre method with &quot;s&quot; stages has order 2&quot;s&quot; (thus, methods with arbitrarily high order can be constructed). The method with two stages (and thus order four) has Butcher tableau:

:formula_89 

===Stability===
The advantage of implicit Runge–Kutta methods over explicit ones is their greater stability, especially when applied to stiff equations. Consider the linear test equation formula_90. A Runge–Kutta method applied to this equation reduces to the iteration formula_91, with &quot;r&quot; given by

:formula_92 

where &quot;e&quot; stands for the vector of ones. The function &quot;r&quot; is called the &quot;stability function&quot;. It follows from the formula that &quot;r&quot; is the quotient of two polynomials of degree &quot;s&quot; if the method has &quot;s&quot; stages. Explicit methods have a strictly lower triangular matrix &quot;A&quot;, which implies that det(&quot;I&quot; − &quot;zA&quot;) = 1 and that the stability function is a polynomial.

The numerical solution to the linear test equation decays to zero if | &quot;r&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) | &lt; 1 with &quot;z&quot; = &quot;h&quot;λ. The set of such &quot;z&quot; is called the &quot;domain of absolute stability&quot;. In particular, the method is said to be absolute stable if all &quot;z&quot; with Re(&quot;z&quot;) &lt; 0 are in the domain of absolute stability. The stability function of an explicit Runge–Kutta method is a polynomial, so explicit Runge–Kutta methods can never be A-stable.

If the method has order &quot;p&quot;, then the stability function satisfies formula_93 as formula_94. Thus, it is of interest to study quotients of polynomials of given degrees that approximate the exponential function the best. These are known as Padé approximants. A Padé approximant with numerator of degree &quot;m&quot; and denominator of degree &quot;n&quot; is A-stable if and only if &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot; + 2.

The Gauss–Legendre method with &quot;s&quot; stages has order 2&quot;s&quot;, so its stability function is the Padé approximant with &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot; = &quot;s&quot;. It follows that the method is A-stable. This shows that A-stable Runge–Kutta can have arbitrarily high order. In contrast, the order of A-stable linear multistep methods cannot exceed two.

==B-stability==
The &quot;A-stability&quot; concept for the solution of differential equations is related to the linear autonomous equation formula_95. proposed the investigation of stability of numerical schemes when applied to nonlinear systems that satisfy a monotonicity condition. The corresponding concepts were defined as &quot;G-stability&quot; for multistep methods (and the related one-leg methods) and &quot;B-stability&quot; (Butcher, 1975) for Runge–Kutta methods. A Runge–Kutta method applied to the non-linear system formula_96, which verifies formula_97, is called &quot;B-stable&quot;, if this condition implies formula_98 for two numerical solutions.

Let formula_99, formula_100 and formula_101 be three formula_102 matrices defined by
formula_103
A Runge–Kutta method is said to be &quot;algebraically stable&quot; if the matrices formula_99 and formula_100 are both non-negative definite. A sufficient condition for &quot;B-stability&quot; is: formula_99 and formula_101 are non-negative definite.

==Derivation of the Runge–Kutta fourth-order method==
In general a Runge–Kutta method of order formula_43 can be written as:
:formula_109
where:
:formula_110
are increments obtained evaluating the derivatives of formula_111 at the formula_112-th order.

We develop the derivation for the Runge–Kutta fourth-order method using the general formula with formula_113 evaluated, as explained above, at the starting point, the midpoint and the end point of any interval formula_114; thus, we choose:

: formula_115

and formula_116 otherwise. We begin by defining the following quantities:
:formula_117
where formula_118 and formula_119
If we define:
:formula_120
and for the previous relations we can show that the following equalities hold up to formula_121:formula_122
where:formula_123
is the total derivative of formula_11 with respect to time.

If we now express the general formula using what we just derived we obtain:formula_125

and comparing this with the Taylor series of formula_126 around formula_3:formula_128

we obtain a system of constraints on the coefficients:

:formula_129
which when solved gives formula_130 as stated above.

<text>Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon is an American television writer, screenwriter and producer, working primarily in the science fiction genre. O&#x27;Bannon has created five original television series (&quot;Farscape&quot;, &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, &quot;Defiance&quot;, &quot;Cult&quot;, and &quot;Alien Nation&quot;).

O&#x27;Bannon made his writing debut selling spec material to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985) and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (1985), but first garnered critical attention for his film &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1988) and its subsequent spinoff television show. His next notable achievement was his original series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; (1993) which ran for three seasons. O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s most critically acclaimed success was the space epic &quot;Farscape&quot; on the Sci-Fi Channel (1999–2003) which ran for four seasons and spun off into a mini-series as well as a comic book series. Since &quot;Farscape&quot;, he has created the television show &quot;Defiance&quot; (2013) and The CW&#x27;s &quot;Cult&quot; (2013), the miniseries &quot;The Triangle&quot; (2005), as well as an uncredited rewrite on the pilot for &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; (2009). He has also served as Executive Producer and writer on &quot;Constantine&quot;, &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;Evil&quot; (on CBS) among others.

O&#x27;Bannon has been credited with creating original series &quot;that push the boundaries of speculative television in ways that put him in the rare company of writers like Rod Serling.&quot; He has won multiple Saturn Awards (including best series for &quot;Farscape&quot;) and been nominated for other awards such as a Hugo Award and a WGA Award.

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s career got its start with a couple of spec scripts he had written for submission to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Darkroom&quot;. However, the show was canceled before his material could be produced. He followed it up by submitting those scripts to both the CBS revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and NBC&#x27;s new anthology series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, receiving positive reaction from both shows. Based on his pitches for some additional stories, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; producers hired him as Story Editor. During his time on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, he wrote and rewrote several episodes, including more original episodes than anyone else. Among his original episodes was &quot;Wordplay&quot;, starring Robert Klein, his first, and &quot;The Storyteller&quot; which was nominated for that year&#x27;s Writer&#x27;s Guild Award.

After the cancellation of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, O&#x27;Bannon turned his efforts to a new project: &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1988), his first feature film. The film and subsequent television series developed a strong fan following which has resulted in a television series, five television films, comic books, and novels.

He made his directorial debut on the suspense thriller &quot;Fear&quot;, a Showtime original that premiered on July 15, 1990.

=== 1990s ===
O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s biggest success was his cult classic and fan favorite &quot;Farscape&quot;. Originally sold to the Sci-Fi Channel, the head of the network told O&#x27;Bannon &quot;Just make it as weird as you can, because I just don&#x27;t want a kids&#x27; show.&quot; In an interview with the Huffington Post, O&#x27;Bannon said: &quot;The greatest words I&#x27;ve ever heard were, &#x27;Just make it as weird as you can.&#x27; It took all the restraints off! And it was their decision to shoot in Australia that made Farscape a classic. Australians are just incredibly creative and they embraced the insanity of the show.&quot;

=== 2000s ===
O&#x27;Bannon began the new millennium continuing work on &quot;Farscape&quot;. After a four-season run, the show was caught in a business conflict when The Henson Company was sold to foreign investors, and ended without an already-ordered fifth season. Fans were wildly upset and began campaigning en masse to the Sci-Fi Channel. The Sci-Fi Channel then committed to making the three-hour mini-series &quot;&quot; to wrap up the show. Brian Henson directed the mini-series with O&#x27;Bannon and his friend David Kemper writing and executive producing. The cancellation of &quot;Farscape&quot; has been lamented and noted as a blunder for the Sci-Fi Channel.

O&#x27;Bannon almost immediately then sold &quot;The Triangle&quot; to the Sci-Fi Channel which he wrote and executive produced with Bryan Singer and Dean Devlin. &quot;The Triangle&quot; aired to stellar ratings and was a critical success. He then sold his pilot &quot;Cult&quot; to The WB, but the series didn&#x27;t proceed at that time when The WB was merged with UPN to become The CW. Around this time the Sci-Fi Channel asked O&#x27;Bannon to rewrite the pilot script for &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;, ending up with a series order.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, O&#x27;Bannon was asked to help out on ABC&#x27;s reboot of &quot;V&quot; which was struggling in its second season. Early in 2011, Syfy approached O&#x27;Bannon to create and serve as showrunner for their project &quot;Defiance&quot;. &quot;Defiance&quot;″s concept included combining a TV series with a massively multiplayer online game (or MMO) that was developed concurrently by Trion Worlds Online. With &quot;Defiance&quot; up and running, O&#x27;Bannon moved on to Warner Bros. Television when it was announced the CW had placed a pilot order to make &quot;Cult&quot; in January 2012 nearly seven years after the network&#x27;s predecessor had bought it. With both of his projects slated to go on the air, O&#x27;Bannon chose to follow his longtime passion project.

O&#x27;Bannon originally wrote &quot;Cult&quot; in the aftermath of &quot;Farscape&quot; and watching the legions of fans mobilize to save the show. &quot;I saw this phenomenon with fans rallying around the show. Okay, what if there wasn&#x27;t this wonderfully warm sci-fi adventure show, but it was something a little bit darker and edgier? What kind of fans would that bring in? That&#x27;s what started me down the path of creating Cult.&quot; When asked about leaving &quot;Defiance&quot; for &quot;Cult&quot;, Rockne responded: &quot;It was a difficult transition for me because I really did and do love &#x27;Defiance&#x27;, but &#x27;Cult&#x27; is really my baby.&quot;

&quot;Cult&quot; went into production shortly after in February 2012, and a season order was placed May 11, 2012. &quot;Cult&quot; was a unique viewer experience designed to break the fourth wall. Rockne explained the appeal of the show, &quot;The show, itself, is kind of invading your space, because it&#x27;s not letting you just passively watch it. I&#x27;m watching a show called Cult about people watching a show called Cult... Cult was really an attempt to break down the fourth wall, to break the glass between you and the TV show.&quot;

O&#x27;Bannon next began work as executive producer on the second season of &quot;Revolution&quot;. Despite praise for the revamped and grittier season, NBC declined to add a third season and canceled the show after 42 episodes. After &quot;Revolution&quot;, O&#x27;Bannon was asked by Warner Bros. Television and NBC to consult on their fledgling horror series &quot;Constantine&quot;.

As of 2019, O&#x27;Bannon is an executive producer for &quot;Evil&quot; on CBS.

<doc id="213676" wikidata="Q383227" url="?curid=213676" title="Ten (Pearl Jam album)">
<text>Ten is the debut studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released on August 27, 1991, through Epic Records. Following the dissolution of their previous band Mother Love Bone in 1990, bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard began rehearsing with new guitarist Mike McCready. The group recorded a five-song instrumental demo tape that included contributions from Matt Cameron on drums. Copies of the demo were eventually given to drummer Dave Krusen and vocalist Eddie Vedder, both of whom were invited to audition for the band in Seattle. Many of the songs on &quot;Ten&quot; were instrumental jams or reworked Mother Love Bone songs for which Vedder provided lyrics.

Despite its reputation as a quintessential grunge album, &quot;Ten&quot; is often noted for displaying a stronger classic rock influence than other contemporary grunge releases, drawing comparisons to the work of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. The album is also characterised as having an anthemic, rich sound. &quot;Ten&quot; was not an immediate commercial success, but by late 1992, it had reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album produced three hit singles: &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot;.

&quot;Jeremy&quot; became one of Pearl Jam&#x27;s best-known songs, and received nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock Performance at the 35th Grammy Awards. MTV put the video for &quot;Jeremy&quot; into heavy rotation; it received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video. In 2021, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Beyond its role in consolidating the mainstream success of grunge rock in the early 1990s, &quot;Ten&quot; is generally considered to have been instrumental in the rise and dominance of alternative rock throughout the decade. The album has since been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest albums of all time. By February 2013, it had sold 13 million copies in the US, becoming the 22nd record to do so in the Nielsen SoundScan era, and has been certified 13× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Ten&quot; remains Pearl Jam&#x27;s most commercially successful album.

==Background==
Guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament had played together in the pioneering grunge band Green River. Following Green River&#x27;s dissolution in 1987, Ament and Gossard played together in Mother Love Bone during the late 1980s. Mother Love Bone&#x27;s career was cut short when vocalist Andrew Wood died of a drug overdose in 1990, shortly before the release of the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Apple&quot;. Devastated, it took months before Gossard and Ament agreed to play together again. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band Shadow had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. The three then went into the studio for separate sessions with Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and former Shadow drummer Chris Friel to record some instrumental demos. Five of the songs recorded—&quot;Dollar Short&quot;, &quot;Agytian Crave&quot;, &quot;Footsteps&quot;, &quot;Richard&#x27;s E&quot;, and &quot;E Ballad&quot;—were compiled onto a tape called &quot;Stone Gossard Demos &#x27;91&quot; that was circulated in the hopes of finding a singer and drummer for the trio.

San Diego musician Eddie Vedder acquired a copy of the demo in September 1990, when it was given to him by former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons. Vedder listened to the demo, went surfing, and wrote lyrics the next day for &quot;Dollar Short&quot;, &quot;Agytian Crave&quot;, and &quot;Footsteps&quot;. &quot;Dollar Short&quot; and &quot;Agytian Crave&quot; were later retitled &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Once&quot;, respectively. Gossard and Ament heard the demo with Vedder&#x27;s vocals and lyrics, and were impressed enough to fly Vedder out to Seattle for an audition. Meanwhile, Vedder had written lyrics for &quot;E Ballad&quot;, retitled &quot;Black&quot;. Vedder arrived on October 13 and rehearsed with the band (now joined by drummer Dave Krusen) for a week, writing eleven songs in the process. Vedder was soon hired as the band&#x27;s singer, and the group signed to Epic Records shortly thereafter.

==Recording==
The band, then named Mookie Blaylock (after the basketball player of that name), entered London Bridge Studios in Seattle, Washington in March 1991 with producer Rick Parashar to record its debut album. After working with Parashar on &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot;, Stone and Ament asked him to co-produce and engineer &quot;Ten&quot;. Parashar also contributed piano, organ, percussion, co-wrote vocal harmonies and co-wrote the intro/outro of the album. A few tracks were previously recorded at London Bridge in January, but only &quot;Alive&quot; was carried over from that session. The album sessions were quick and lasted only a month, mainly due to the band having already written most of the material for the record. &quot;Porch&quot;, &quot;Deep&quot;, &quot;Why Go&quot;, and &quot;Garden&quot; were first recorded during the album sessions; everything else had been previously recorded during demo sessions at some point. McCready said that &quot;&quot;Ten&quot; was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time.&quot; Ament stated, &quot;We knew we were still a long way from being a real band at that point.&quot;

The recording sessions for &quot;Ten&quot; were completed in May 1991. Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehab. According to Krusen, he was suffering from personal problems at the time. Krusen said, &quot;It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special,&quot; and added, &quot;They had to let me go. I couldn&#x27;t stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave me many chances, but I couldn&#x27;t get it together.&quot; In June, the band joined Tim Palmer in England for mixing. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was &quot;about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get.&quot; Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the guitar solo on &quot;Alive&quot; and tweaking the intro to &quot;Black&quot;. Palmer overdubbed a pepper shaker and a fire extinguisher as percussion on &quot;Oceans&quot;.

In subsequent years, band members have expressed dissatisfaction with the way the album&#x27;s mixing turned out. In 2001, Ament said, &quot;I&#x27;d love to remix &quot;Ten&quot;. Ed, for sure, would agree with me. It wouldn&#x27;t be like changing performances; just pull some of the reverb off it.&quot; In 2002, Gossard said, &quot;It was &#x27;over-rocked&#x27;, we were novices in the studio and spent too long recording, doing different takes, and killing the vibe and overdubbing tons of guitar. There&#x27;s a lot of reverb on the record.&quot; In 2006, Vedder said, &quot;I can listen to the early records [except] the first record...it&#x27;s just the sound of the record. It was kind of mixed in a way that was...it was kind of produced.&quot;

According to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Mike McCready&#x27;s undisguised Stevie Ray Vaughan passion saw him bring Strats back into vogue. The guitarist described his playing on &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Even Flow&quot; as an SRV “rip off”. Both guitarists used Marshall JCM800s for dirty tones and Fenders for clean parts.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Ten&quot; has been described as a grunge, alternative rock, and hard rock album. Several of the songs on the album started as instrumental compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, &quot;All I really believe in is this fucking moment, like right now. And that, actually, is what the whole album talks about.&quot; Vedder&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Ten&quot; deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness (&quot;Even Flow&quot;) and the use of psychiatric hospitals (&quot;Why Go&quot;). The song &quot;Jeremy&quot; and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.

Many listeners interpreted &quot;Alive&quot; as an inspirational anthem due to its decidedly uplifting instrumentals and chorus. Vedder has since revealed that the song tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather (his real father having died long ago), while his mother&#x27;s grief turns her to sadly embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Once&quot; formed part of a song cycle in what Vedder later described as a &quot;mini-opera&quot; entitled &quot;Momma-Son&quot; (the third song, &quot;Footsteps&quot;, appeared as a B-side on the &quot;Jeremy&quot; single). Vedder explained that the lyrics told the story of a young man whose father dies (&quot;Alive&quot;), causing him to go on a killing spree (&quot;Once&quot;) which leads to his capture and execution (&quot;Footsteps&quot;). It was later revealed that Vedder&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by his long-held hurt in discovering at age 17 that the man he thought was his father was not, and that his real father had already died.

While &quot;Ten&quot; deals with dark subject matter, it has generally been seen as a high-water mark of the early 1990s alternative rock sound, with Vedder&#x27;s unusually deep and strong (and later much-imitated) voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained, guitar-heavy, hard rock sound that drew influence from Led Zeppelin and other rock bands of the 1970s. &quot;Ten&quot;&#x27;s musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an &quot;expansive harmonic vocabulary&quot; with an anthemic sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that the songs on the album fused &quot;the riff-heavy stadium rock of the 1970s with the grit and anger of &#x27;80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.&quot;

&quot;Ten&quot; features a two-part track entitled &quot;Master/Slave&quot; that both opens and closes the album. The first part begins the album, before &quot;Once&quot; starts, and the second part closes the album, after &quot;Release&quot;. It begins about ten seconds after the album&#x27;s closer &quot;Release&quot; as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line making up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine interview as &quot;my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn&quot;), along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, &quot;As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, and then I just started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that.&quot; In a 2021 interview with Kyle Meredith, Ament also revealed that he took inspiration from Cheap Trick&#x27;s bass sounds for songs &quot;Why Go&quot; and &quot;Jeremy&quot;.

===Outtakes===
The album&#x27;s singles featured two B-sides from the &quot;Ten&quot; recording sessions which were not included on the album, &quot;Wash&quot; and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;. The former was a B-side on the &quot;Alive&quot; single while the latter was featured on the &quot;Jeremy&quot; single and eventually became a radio hit in 1994. Both songs were included on the 2003 &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; collection of rarities, although the included version of &quot;Wash&quot; is an alternate take. The song &quot;Alone&quot; was also originally recorded for &quot;Ten&quot;; a 1992 re-recorded version of the song is on the &quot;Go&quot; single. Another version of &quot;Alone&quot;, with re-recorded vocals, appears on &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;. According to McCready, &quot;Alone&quot; was cut from &quot;Ten&quot; because the band already had enough mid-tempo songs for the album. The song &quot;Dirty Frank&quot;, which was released as a B-side on the &quot;Even Flow&quot; single and often thought to be a &quot;Ten&quot; outtake, was recorded after &quot;Ten&quot; was released. Thus, &quot;Dirty Frank&quot; is not from the &quot;Ten&quot; recording sessions.

The song &quot;Footsteps&quot; began as an instrumental demo and was compiled onto the &quot;Stone Gossard Demos &#x27;91&quot; tape. Vedder added vocals to this version after he received the demo tape. The music for &quot;Footsteps&quot; was also used for Temple of the Dog&#x27;s &quot;Times of Trouble&quot;. &quot;Footsteps&quot; was featured as a B-side on the &quot;Jeremy&quot; single, however this version is taken from a 1992 appearance on the radio show &quot;Rockline&quot;. This version of &quot;Footsteps&quot; is also featured on &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;, however a harmonica intro has been overdubbed on to the recording.

Other songs rejected from the album but later included on &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; are &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;Brother&quot;, the latter of which was turned into an instrumental for &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;. &quot;Brother&quot; was cut because Gossard was no longer interested in playing the song, a decision which Ament objected to and almost caused him to quit the band. The version of &quot;Brother&quot; with vocals appears on the 2009 &quot;Ten&quot; reissue and became a radio hit that same year. Both &quot;Breath&quot; and &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; were recorded with the intention of the two songs possibly appearing in the film &quot;Singles&quot;. The versions heard in the film and on its soundtrack were recorded a year later in 1992. The versions from the &quot;Ten&quot; sessions appear on the 2009 &quot;Ten&quot; reissue. Other songs rejected from the album but included on the 2009 &quot;Ten&quot; reissue are &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;2,000 Mile Blues&quot;, and &quot;Evil Little Goat&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
===Packaging===
The album&#x27;s cover art features the members of the band at the time of recording in a group pose and standing in front of a wood cut-out of the name &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, with their hands risen high and holding one another&#x27;s. The wood cut-out was constructed by Jeff Ament. Ament said, &quot;The original concept was about really being together as a group and entering into the world of music as a true band...a sort of all-for-one deal.&quot; Ament is credited for the album&#x27;s artwork and art direction, Lance Mercer receives credit for photography, and both Lisa Sparagano and Risa Zaitschek are credited for design. Ament stated, &quot;There was a bit of headbutting going on with the Sony art department at that time. The version that everybody got to know as the &quot;Ten&quot; album cover was pink and it was originally intended to be more of a burgundy color and the picture of the band was supposed to be black and white.&quot; Pearl Jam&#x27;s original name was taken from the professional basketball player Mookie Blaylock. It was changed after the band signed to Epic Records, as record executives were concerned about intellectual property and naming rights following Blaylock&#x27;s inking of an endorsement deal with Nike. In commemoration of the band&#x27;s original name, the band titled &quot;Ten&quot; after Blaylock&#x27;s jersey number.

In some versions (mainly CD and cassette releases), the cover is in gatefold form, folded in such a way that only the band members&#x27; hands are visible.

===Tour===

Ament stated that &quot;essentially &quot;Ten&quot; was just an excuse to tour&quot;, adding, &quot;We told the record company, &#x27;We know we can be a great band, so let&#x27;s just get the opportunity to get out and play.&#x27;&quot; Pearl Jam faced a relentless touring schedule for &quot;Ten&quot;. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band&#x27;s &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour&quot; in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of the Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the concert bill. Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that &quot;the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio.&quot;

In 1992, the band embarked on its first ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played &quot;Ten&quot; in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia&#x27;s Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band&#x27;s tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band&#x27;s audience expanded, saying that unlike before, &quot;everyone came.&quot; The band&#x27;s manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, &quot;Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. During their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say he wanted to talk to Brett, the sound guy, and they&#x27;d carry him out there on their hands. You hadn&#x27;t really seen that reaction from a crowd before...&quot; When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, &quot;We&#x27;d been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever.&quot; The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.

===2009 re-release===
On March 24, 2009, &quot;Ten&quot; was reissued in four editions (Legacy, Deluxe, Vinyl, and Super Deluxe). It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam&#x27;s entire catalogue that led up to the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2011. The extras on the four editions include a remastering and remix of the entire album by producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, re-designed packaging, six bonus tracks (&quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Breath and a Scream&quot;, &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot;, &quot;2,000 Mile Blues&quot;, and &quot;Evil Little Goat&quot;), a DVD of the band&#x27;s 1992 appearance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (including a bonus performance of &quot;Oceans&quot;, which along with &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; was originally excluded from the broadcast version), vinyl versions of the album, an LP of the band&#x27;s September 20, 1992 concert at Magnuson Park in Seattle (also known as &quot;Drop in the Park&quot;), a replica of the original &quot;Momma-Son&quot; demo cassette, and a replica of Vedder&#x27;s composition notebook containing personal notes and mementos.

Regarding his remix of the album, O&#x27;Brien stated, &quot;The band loved the original mix of &quot;Ten&quot;, but were also interested in what it would sound like if I were to deconstruct and remix it...The original &quot;Ten&quot; sound is what millions of people bought, dug and loved, so I was initially hesitant to mess around with that. After years of persistent nudging from the band, I was able to wrap my head around the idea of offering it as a companion piece to the original—giving a fresh take on it, a more direct sound.&quot;

The &quot;Ten&quot; reissue sold 60,000 copies in its first week, the second biggest selling week for the album since Christmas 1993. Since &quot;Billboard&quot; considers the &quot;Ten&quot; reissue a catalog item, &quot;Ten&quot; did not appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Top Modern Rock/Alternative, or Top Rock Albums, since those charts do not include catalog items. Had it been included on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the 60,000 copies sold of the &quot;Ten&quot; reissue would have placed it at number five. The reissue also re-entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 11, giving it a new peak chart position in Australia and its highest chart placing since June 14, 1992.

Tying in with the re-release of the album in March 2009, the entire album was made available as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series of video games. In addition, three &quot;Ten&quot;-era bonus tracks were made available for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; video game for those who purchased the &quot;Ten&quot; re-release through Best Buy: &quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, and &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot;, the latter two as live versions taken from the band&#x27;s September 20 concert.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, music critic David Fricke praised &quot;Ten&quot;, saying that Pearl Jam &quot;hurtles into the mystic at warp speed.&quot; He also added that Pearl Jam &quot;wring a lot of drama out of a few declarative power chords swimming in echo.&quot; Allan Jones of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; suggested in his review of &quot;Ten&quot; that it is Vedder who provides Pearl Jam &quot;with such a uniquely compelling focus&quot;. In &quot;Q&quot;, Dave Henderson called it &quot;raucous modern rock, spiked with infectious guitar motifs and powered with driving bass and drums,&quot; and said it &quot;may well be the face of the 90&#x27;s metal.&quot; &quot;Stereo Review&quot;″s Ron Givens said that the band &quot;sounds larger than life, producing a towering inferno of roaring guitars, monumental bass and drums, and from-the-gut vocals.&quot; Don Kaye of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; defined the album as &quot;introspective and charged with a quiet emotional force&quot;. Greg Kot wrote in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Occasionally overwrought and unrelentingly humorless, the music nonetheless exerts a hypnotic power at its best.&quot;

David Browne was less enthusiastic in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;; he found Pearl Jam to be derivative of &quot;fellow Northwestern rockers like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and the defunct Mother Love Bone&quot;, and felt that it &quot;goes to show that just about anything can be harnessed and packaged.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; accused Pearl Jam of &quot;trying to steal money from young alternative kids&#x27; pockets&quot;, with reviewer Angela Lewis deeming the band unworthy of comparisons to Nirvana and Soundgarden. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, gave the album a &quot;B−&quot; and viewed it as another in a &quot;slew of Seattle albums&quot; that &quot;modulate the same misguided ethos&quot;, which he said was &quot;hippie&quot; rather than &quot;punk&quot;. Christgau described it as &quot;San Francisco ballroom music&quot; whose &quot;distinguishing characteristics&quot; could only be discerned by listeners if they &quot;take the right drugs&quot;. He later gave &quot;Ten&quot; a &quot;two-star honorable mention&quot;, citing &quot;Once&quot; and &quot;Even Flow&quot; as highlights, and quipped, &quot;in life, abuse justifies melodrama; in music, riffs work better&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Ten&quot; in retrospect, AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey called it a &quot;flawlessly crafted hard rock masterpiece&quot; and felt that Vedder&#x27;s &quot;impressionistic lyrics&quot; are more effective through his passionate vocal delivery rather than their &quot;concrete meaning.&quot; Charles R. Cross wrote in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) that &quot;Ten&quot; sounded less original and more self-important than Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, but it also showcases the band&#x27;s intricate guitar style and Vedder&#x27;s distinctive singing.

===Legacy===
Defined by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s George Garner as &quot;arguably the greatest rock debut record of all time&quot;, &quot;Ten,&quot; in 2003, was ranked number 207 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 209 in a 2012 revised list. In 2020 it was raised to the 160th position on the list, which was carried over for the 2023 edition. Readers of &quot;Q&quot; voted &quot;Ten&quot; as the 42nd greatest album ever; however, three years later the album was listed lower at 59th. In 2003, VH1 placed it at number 83 on their list of the 100 greatest albums of rock and roll. In 2006, &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; organised a poll of which, 40,000 people worldwide voted for the 100 best albums ever and &quot;Ten&quot; was placed at number 66 on the list. It was also ranked number 15 in the October 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time. In 2007, the album was included at number 11 on the list of the &quot;Definitive 200&quot; albums of all time developed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In December 2020, the album was announced as one of many inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as part of the 2021 class.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Ten&quot; initially sold slowly upon its release, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, attaining an RIAA gold certification. Almost a year after its release, the album finally broke into the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart on May 30, 1992, reaching number eight. &quot;Ten&quot; would eventually peak at number two for four weeks. It was held off the top spot by the Billy Ray Cyrus album, &quot;Some Gave All&quot;. The album spent a total of 264 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, making it one of the top 15 charting albums ever.
By February 1993, American sales of &quot;Ten&quot; surpassed those of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the breakthrough album by fellow grunge band Nirvana. &quot;Ten&quot; continued to sell well two years after its release; in 1993 it was the eighth best-selling album in the United States, outselling Pearl Jam&#x27;s second album, &quot;Vs.&quot; As of February 2013, &quot;Ten&quot; has sold 13 million copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has been certified 13× platinum by the RIAA.

&quot;Ten&quot; produced three hit singles, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot;, all of which had accompanying music videos (The &quot;Oceans&quot; video was released only outside of the U.S.). The singles all placed on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts. The song &quot;Black&quot; reached number three on the Mainstream Rock chart, despite never being released as a single. The video for &quot;Alive&quot; was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video in 1992. &quot;Jeremy&quot; became one of Pearl Jam&#x27;s best-known songs, and received nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock Performance at the 1993 Grammy awards. The video for &quot;Jeremy&quot;, directed by Mark Pellington, was put into heavy rotation by MTV and became a huge hit, receiving five nominations at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, of which it won four, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video.

<doc id="213682" wikidata="Q3491292" url="?curid=213682" title="Thermal depolymerization">
<text>Thermal depolymerization (TDP) is the process of converting a polymer into a monomer or a mixture of monomers, by predominantly thermal means. It may be catalyzed or un-catalyzed and is distinct from other forms of depolymerization which may rely on the use of chemicals or biological action. This process is associated with an increase in entropy.

For most polymers, thermal depolymerization is chaotic process, giving a mixture of volatile compounds. Materials may be depolymerized in this way during waste management, with the volatile components produced being burnt as a form of synthetic fuel in a waste-to-energy process. For other polymers, thermal depolymerization is an ordered process giving a single product, or limited range of products; these transformations are usually more valuable and form the basis of some plastic recycling technologies.

==Disordered depolymerization==
For most polymeric materials, thermal depolymerization proceeds in a disordered manner, with random chain scission giving a mixture of volatile compounds. The result is broadly akin to pyrolysis, although at higher temperatures gasification takes place. These reactions can be seen during waste management, with the products being burnt as synthetic fuel in a waste-to-energy process. In comparison to simply incinerating the starting polymer, depolymerization gives a material with a higher heating value, which can be burnt more efficiently and may also be sold. Incineration can also produce harmful dioxins and dioxin-like compounds and requires specially designed reactors and emission control systems in order to be performed safely. As the depolymerization step requires heat, it is energy-consuming; thus, the ultimate balance of energy efficiency compared to straight incineration can be very tight and has been the subject of criticism.

===Biomass===
Many agricultural and animal wastes can be processed, but these are often already used as fertilizer, animal feed, and, in some cases, as feedstocks for paper mills or as low-quality boiler fuel. Thermal depolymerization can convert these into more economically valuable materials. Numerous biomass to liquid technologies have been developed. In general, biochemicals contain oxygen atoms, which are retained during pyrolysis, giving liquid products rich in phenols and furans. These can be viewed as partially oxidized and make for low-grade fuels. Hydrothermal liquefaction technologies dehydrate the biomass during thermal processing to produce a more energy-rich product stream. Similarly, gasification produces hydrogen, a very high-energy fuel.

===Plastics===
Plastic waste consists mostly of commodity plastics and may be actively sorted from municipal waste. Pyrolysis of mixed plastics can give a fairly broad mix of chemical products (between about 1 and 15 carbon atoms), including gases and aromatic liquids. Catalysts can give a better-defined product with a higher value. Likewise, hydrocracking can be employed to give LPG products. The presence of PVC can be problematic, as its thermal depolymerization generates large amounts of HCl, which can corrode equipment and cause undesirable chlorination of the products. It must be either excluded or compensated for by installing dechlorination technologies. Polyethylene and polypropylene account for just less than half of global plastic production and, being pure hydrocarbons, have a higher potential for conversion to fuel. Plastic-to-fuel technologies have historically struggled to be economically viable due to the costs of collecting and sorting the plastic and the relatively low value of the fuel produced. Large plants are seen as being more economical than smaller ones, but require more investment to build.

The method can, however, result in a mild net-decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, though other studies dispute this. For example, a 2020 study released by Renolds on their own Hefty EnergyBag program shows net greenhouse gas emissions. The study showed then when all cradle-to-grave energy costs are tallied, burning in a cement kiln was far superior. Cement kiln fuel scored a -61.1 kg equivalents compared to +905 kg eq. It also fared far worse in terms of landfill reduction vs. kiln fuel. Other studies have confirmed that plastics pyrolysis to fuel programs are also more energy intensive.

For tire waste management, tire pyrolysis is also an option. Oil derived from tire rubber pyrolysis contains high sulfur content, which gives it high potential as a pollutant and requires hydrodesulfurization before use. The area faces legislative, economic, and marketing obstacles. In most cases, tires are simply incinerated as tire-derived fuel.

===Municipal waste===
Thermal treatment of municipal waste can involve the depolymerization of a very wide range of compounds, including plastics and biomass. Technologies can include simple incineration as well as pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma gasification. All of these are able to accommodate mixed and contaminated feedstocks. The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste, particularly in densely populated areas lacking suitable sites for new landfills. In many countries, incineration with energy recovery remains the most common method, with more advanced technologies being hindered by technical and cost hurdles.

==Ordered depolymerization==
Some materials thermally decompose in an ordered manner to give a single or limited range of products. By virtue of being pure materials, they are usually more valuable than the mixtures produced by disordered thermal depolymerization. For plastics this is usually the starting monomer, and when this is recycled back into fresh polymer, it is called feedstock recycling. In practice, not all depolymerization reactions are completely efficient, and some competitive pyrolysis is often observed.

===Biomass===
Biorefineries convert low-value agricultural and animal waste into useful chemicals. The industrial production of furfural by the acid-catalyzed thermal treatment of hemicellulose has been in operation for over a century. Lignin has been the subject of significant research for the potential production of BTX and other aromatic compounds, although such processes have not yet been commercialized with any lasting success.

===Plastics===
Certain polymers like PTFE, Nylon 6, polystyrene, and PMMA undergo depolymerization to give their starting monomers. These can be converted back into new plastic, a process called chemical or feedstock recycling. In theory, this offers infinite recyclability, but it is also more expensive and has a higher carbon footprint than other forms of plastic recycling; however, in practice, this still yields an inferior product at higher energy costs than virgin polymer production in the real world because of contamination.

==Related processes==
Although rarely employed presently, coal gasification has historically been performed on a large scale. Thermal depolymerization is similar to other processes which use superheated water as a major phase to produce fuels, such as direct hydrothermal liquefaction. These are distinct from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as pyrolysis. The term &quot;thermochemical conversion&quot; (TCC) has also been used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via pyrolysis. A demonstration plant due to start up in the Netherlands is said to be capable of processing 64 tons of biomass (dry basis) per day into oil. Thermal depolymerization differs in that it contains a hydrous process followed by an anhydrous cracking / distillation process.

Condensation polymers bearing cleavable groups such as esters and amides can also be completely depolymerized by hydrolysis or solvolysis; this can be a purely chemical process but may also be promoted by enzymes. Such technologies are less well developed than those of thermal depolymerization but have the potential for lower energy costs. Thus far, polyethylene terephthalate has been the most heavily studied polymer. It has been suggested that waste plastic could be converted into other valuable chemicals (not necessarily monomers) by microbial action, but such technology is still in its infancy.

<doc id="213685" wikidata="Q1101819" url="?curid=213685" title="The Second Jungle Book">
<text>The Second Jungle Book is a sequel to &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling. First published in 1895, it features five stories about Mowgli and three unrelated stories, all but one set in India, most of which Kipling wrote while living in Vermont. 

All of the stories were previously published in magazines in 18945, often under different titles. The 1994 film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; used it as a source.

==Contents==
Each story is followed by a related poem:

# &quot;How Fear Came&quot;: This story takes place before Mowgli fights Shere Khan. During a drought, Mowgli and the animals gather at a shrunken Wainganga River for a &quot;Water Truce&quot; where the display of the blue-colored Peace Rock prevents anyone from hunting at its riverbanks. After Shere Khan was driven away by him for nearly defiling the Peace Rock, Hathi the elephant tells Mowgli the story of how the first tiger got his stripes when fear first came to the jungle. This story can be seen as a forerunner of the &quot;Just So Stories&quot;.
# &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot; (poem)
# &quot;The Miracle of Purun Bhagat&quot;: An influential Indian politician abandons his worldly goods to become an ascetic holy man. Later, he must save a village from a landslide with the help of the local animals whom he has befriended.
# &quot;A Song of Kabir&quot; (poem)
# &quot;Letting in the Jungle&quot;: Mowgli has been driven out of the human village for witchcraft, and the superstitious villagers are preparing to kill his adopted parents Messua and her unnamed husband. Mowgli rescues them and then prepares to take revenge.
# &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Song Against People&quot; (poem)
# &quot;The Undertakers&quot;: A mugger crocodile, a jackal and a greater adjutant stork, three of the most unpleasant characters on the river, spend an afternoon bickering with each other until some Englishmen arrive to settle some unfinished business with the crocodile.
# &quot;A Ripple Song&quot; (poem)
# &quot;The King&#x27;s Ankus&quot;: Mowgli discovers a jewelled object beneath the Cold Lairs, which he later discards carelessly, not realising that men will kill each other to possess it. Note: The first edition of &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot; inadvertently omits the final 500 words of this story, in which Mowgli returns the treasure to its hiding-place to prevent further killings. Although the error was corrected in later printings, it was picked up by some later editions.
# &quot;The Song of the Little Hunter&quot; (poem)
# &quot;Quiquern&quot;: A teenaged Inuit boy and girl set out across the arctic ice on a desperate hunt for food to save their tribe from starvation, guided by the mysterious animal-spirit Quiquern. However, Quiquern is not what he seems.
# &quot;Angutivaun Taina&quot; (poem)
# &quot;Red Dog&quot;: Mowgli&#x27;s wolfpack is threatened by a pack of rampaging dholes. Mowgli asks Kaa the python to help him formulate a plan to defeat them.
# &quot;Chil&#x27;s Song&quot; (poem)
# &quot;The Spring Running&quot;: Mowgli, now almost seventeen years old, is growing restless for reasons he cannot understand. On an aimless run through the jungle he stumbles across the village where his adopted mother Messua is now living with her two-year-old son, and is torn between staying with her and returning to the jungle.
# &quot;The Outsong&quot; (poem)

<doc id="213692" wikidata="Q177904" url="?curid=213692" title="Zemsky Sobor">
<text>The Zemsky Sobor () was a parliament of the Tsardom of Russia&#x27;s estates of the realm active during the 16th and 17th centuries.

The assembly represented Russia&#x27;s feudal classes in three categories: Nobility and the high bureaucracy, the &quot;Holy Sobor&quot; of the Orthodox clergy, and representatives of &quot;commoners&quot; including merchants and townspeople. Assemblies could be summoned either by the tsar, the patriarch, or the boyar duma, to decide current agenda, controversial issues or enact major pieces of legislation.

== Tsardom of Russia ==
In the 16th century, Tsar Ivan the Terrible held the first &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; in 1549, holding several assemblies primarily as a rubber stamp but also to address initiatives taken by the lower nobility and townspeople.

=== Times of Troubles ===
 The Time of Troubles saw the Zemsky Sobor elect Boris Godunov as Tsar in 1598 during the succession crisis after the end of the Rurik Dynasty. Assemblies were held annually after Mikhail Romanov was elected Tsar in Zemsky Sobor of 1613, but lost influence as the Romanov dynasty became more established, with the assembly to ratify the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654 the last for thirty years. The last Zemsky Sobors were held in the 1680s to abolish the &quot;mestnichestvo&quot; system and to ratify the &quot;Eternal Peace&quot; with Poland-Lithuania.

==1922 Zemsky Sobor==
The &quot;Zemsky Sobor of Amur region&quot; (Приамурский Земский Собор) of the Provisional Priamurye Government was convened in Vladivostok on July 23, 1922, by Mikhail Diterikhs during the Russian Civil War. Diterikhs was a general of the White Army in the Russian Far East and convened the assembly four years after the execution of the Romanov family to proclaim a new monarchy, naming Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as the Tsar of Russia, with Patriarch Tikhon as the honorary chairman of the Zemsky Sobor. Neither Nikolai or Tikhon were present at the assembly, and the plan was cancelled when the region fell to the Bolsheviks two months later.

<doc id="213693" wikidata="Q2181982" url="?curid=213693" title="Absalom, Absalom!">
<text>Absalom, Absalom! is a novel by the American author William Faulkner, first published in 1936. Taking place before, during, and after the American Civil War, it is a story about three families of the American South, with a focus on the life of Thomas Sutpen.

&quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, along with &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, helped Faulkner win the Nobel Prize in Literature for the year 1949. In 2009, a panel of judges called &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; the best Southern novel of all time.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; details the rise and fall of Thomas Sutpen, a white man born into poverty in western Virginia who moves to Mississippi with the dual aims of gaining wealth and becoming a powerful family patriarch. The story is told entirely in flashbacks narrated mostly by Quentin Compson to his roommate at Harvard College, Shreve, who frequently contributes his own suggestions and surmises. The narration of Rosa Coldfield, and Quentin&#x27;s father and grandfather, are also included and re-interpreted by Shreve and Quentin, with the total events of the story unfolding in nonchronological order and often with differing details. This results in a peeling-back-the-onion revelation of the true story of the Sutpens. Rosa initially narrates the story, with long digressions and a biased memory, to Quentin Compson, whose grandfather was a friend of Sutpen&#x27;s. Quentin&#x27;s father then fills in some of the details to Quentin. Finally, Quentin relates the story to his roommate Shreve, and in each retelling, the reader receives more details as the parties flesh out the story by adding layers. The final effect leaves the reader more certain about the attitudes and biases of the characters than about the facts of Sutpen&#x27;s story.

Thomas Sutpen arrives in Jefferson, Mississippi, with some slaves and a French architect who has been somehow forced into working for him. Sutpen obtains one hundred square miles of land from a local Native American tribe and immediately begins building a large plantation called Sutpen&#x27;s Hundred, including an ostentatious mansion. All he needs to complete his plan is a wife to bear him a few children (particularly a son to be his heir), so he ingratiates himself with a local merchant and marries the man&#x27;s daughter, Ellen Coldfield. Ellen bears Sutpen two children, a son named Henry and a daughter named Judith, both of whom are destined for tragedy.

Henry goes to the University of Mississippi and meets fellow student Charles Bon, who is ten years his senior. Henry brings Charles home for Christmas, and Charles and Judith begin a quiet romance that leads to a presumed engagement. However, Thomas Sutpen realizes that Charles Bon is his son from an earlier marriage and moves to stop the proposed union.

Sutpen had worked on a plantation in the French West Indies as overseer and, after subduing a slave uprising, was offered the hand of the plantation owner&#x27;s daughter, Eulalia Bon. They had a son, Charles. Sutpen did not know that Eulalia was of mixed race until after the marriage and birth of Charles, but when he discovered that he had been deceived, he renounced the marriage as void and left his wife and child (though leaving them his fortune as part of his own moral recompense). The reader also later learns of Sutpen&#x27;s childhood, when young Thomas learned that society could base human worth on material worth. It is this episode that sets into motion Thomas&#x27; plan to start a dynasty.

When Sutpen tells Henry that Charles is his half-brother and that Judith must not be allowed to marry him, Henry refuses to believe it, repudiates his birthright, and accompanies Charles to his home in New Orleans. They then return to Mississippi to enlist in their University company, joining the Confederate Army to fight in the Civil War. During the war, Henry wrestles with his conscience until he presumably resolves to allow the marriage of half-brother and sister; this resolution changes, however, when Sutpen reveals to Henry that Charles is part black. At the conclusion of the war, Henry enforces his father&#x27;s interdiction of marriage between Charles and Judith, killing Charles at the gates to the mansion and then fleeing into self-exile.

Thomas Sutpen returns from the war and begins to repair his dynasty and his home, whose hundred square miles have been reduced by carpetbaggers and punitive northern action to one square mile. He proposes to Rosa Coldfield, his dead wife&#x27;s younger sister, and she accepts. However, Sutpen insults Rosa by demanding that she bear him a son before the wedding takes place, prompting her to leave Sutpen&#x27;s Hundred. Sutpen then begins an affair with Milly, the 15-year-old granddaughter of Wash Jones, a squatter who lives on the Sutpen property. The affair continues until Milly becomes pregnant and gives birth to a daughter. Sutpen is terribly disappointed, because the last hope of repairing his Sutpen dynasty rested on Milly giving birth to a son. Sutpen casts Milly and the child aside, telling them that they are not worthy of sleeping in the stables with his horse, who had just sired a male. An enraged Wash Jones kills Thomas, Milly, Milly&#x27;s newborn daughter, and finally himself by resisting arrest.

The story of Thomas Sutpen&#x27;s legacy ends with Quentin taking Rosa back to the seemingly abandoned Sutpen&#x27;s Hundred plantation, where they find Henry Sutpen and Clytemnestra (Clytie), the daughter of Thomas Sutpen by a slave woman. Henry has returned to the estate to die. Three months later, when Rosa returns with medical help for Henry, Clytie mistakes them for law enforcement and starts a fire that consumes the plantation and kills Henry and herself. The only remaining Sutpen is Jim Bon, Charles Bon&#x27;s black grandson, a young man with severe mental handicaps, who remains on Sutpen&#x27;s Hundred.

==Analysis==
Like other Faulkner novels, &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; allegorizes Southern history. The title refers to the Biblical story of Absalom, a wayward son of King David, who was killed while fighting the empire his father built, causing grief to David. 

The history of Thomas Sutpen mirrors the rise and fall of Southern plantation culture. Sutpen&#x27;s failures necessarily reflect the weaknesses of an idealistic South. Rigidly committed to his &quot;design&quot;, Sutpen proves unwilling to honor his marriage to a part-black woman, setting in motion his own destruction. 

Discussing &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, Faulkner stated that the curse under which the South labors is slavery, and that Thomas Sutpen&#x27;s personal curse, or flaw, was his belief that he was too strong to need to be a part of the human family.

By using various narrators expressing their interpretations, the novel alludes to the historical cultural zeitgeist of Faulkner&#x27;s South, where the past is always present and constantly in states of revision by the people who tell and retell the story over time; it thus also explores the process of myth-making and the questioning of truth.

&quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; juxtaposes ostensible fact, informed guesswork, and outright speculation—with the implication that reconstructions of the past remain irretrievable and therefore imaginative. Faulkner stated that, although none of the narrators got the facts right since &quot;no one individual can look at truth&quot;, a truth exists and that the reader can ultimately know it.
Most critics have tried to reconstruct this truth behind the shifting narratives, or to show that such a reconstruction cannot be done with certainty or even to prove that there are factual and logical inconsistencies that cannot be overcome. But some critics have stated that, fictional truth being an oxymoron, it is best to take the story as a given, and regard it on the level of myth and archetype, a fable that allows us to glimpse the deepest levels of the unconscious and thus better understand the people who accept (and are ruled by) that myth—Southerners in general and Quentin Compson in particular.

The use of Quentin Compson as the primary perspective (if not exactly the focus) of the novel makes it something of a companion piece to Faulkner&#x27;s earlier work &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, which tells the story of the Compson Family, with Quentin as a main character. Although the action of that novel is never explicitly referenced, the Sutpen family&#x27;s struggle with dynasty, downfall, and potential incest parallel the familial events and obsessions that drive Quentin and Miss Rosa Coldfield to witness the burning of Sutpen&#x27;s Hundred.

==In popular culture ==

The 1983 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; says the &quot;Longest Sentence in Literature&quot; is a sentence from &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; containing 1,288 words (the record has since been broken). The sentence can be found in Chapter 6; it begins with the words &quot;Just exactly like Father&quot;, and ends with &quot;the eye could not see from any point&quot;. The passage is entirely italicized and incomplete.

The final lyric of &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot;, a single released by the Canadian rock band Rush, is the word &#x27;Absalom&#x27; repeated three times. Drummer Neil Peart, the band&#x27;s lyricist, said he &quot;loved the sound of&quot; the title of Faulkner&#x27;s novel and was inspired to look up the Biblical story of Absalom after reading the novel. &quot;Since one of the main themes of the song was compassion, it occurred to me that the Biblical story was applicable.&quot;

<text>A doula (; ; ) is a non-medical professional who provides guidance for the service of others and who supports another person (the doula&#x27;s client) through a significant health-related experience, such as childbirth, miscarriage, induced abortion or stillbirth, as well as non-reproductive experiences such as dying. A doula might also provide support to the client&#x27;s partner, family, and friends.

The doula&#x27;s goal and role is to help the client feel safe and comfortable, complementing the role of the healthcare professionals who provide the client&#x27;s medical care. Unlike a physician, midwife, or nurse, a doula cannot administer medication or other medical treatment or give medical advice. An individual might need to complete training to work as a doula, although training and certification processes vary throughout the world.

Some doulas work as volunteers; others are paid for their services by their client, medical institutions, or other private and public organizations. Doulas receive varying amounts of training, and their professionalism also varies.

The contributions of doulas during reproductive experiences and end-of-life care have been studied and have been shown to benefit their clients. For example, a birth doula providing support during childbirth might increase likelihood of vaginal birth (rather than Caesarean section), decrease the need for pain medication during labor, and improve the perception of the birthing experience.

The benefits of a doula providing other types of support have been less well studied, but might improve a client&#x27;s experience with medical care or help an individual cope with health transitions.

The concept of having a companion providing support to the birthing woman dates back to prehistoric times, evidenced by archeological findings of stone carvings and statues and anthropological studies. However, the contemporary role of &quot;doula&quot; first emerged from the grassroots natural birth movement in the United States in the 1960s when women began desiring unmedicated, low-intervention births and began to have friends and others with formal or practical knowledge about childbirth provide them with support during pregnancy.

The term &quot;doula&quot; was first used in a 1969 anthropological study conducted by Dana Raphael, a protégée of Margaret Mead, with whom she co-founded the Human Lactation Center in Westport, Connecticut, in the 1970s. Raphael suggested it was a widespread practice that a female of the same species be part of childbirth, and in human societies this was traditionally a role occupied by a family member or friend whose presence contributed to successful long-term breastfeeding. Raphael derived the term from modern Greek (, (), &quot;slave&quot;), as told to her by an elderly Greek woman, Eleni Rassias, and described it as coming from &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s time,&quot; an Ancient Greek word meaning &quot;female slave.&quot;

Two physician-researchers, Marshall Klaus and John Kennell, who conducted clinical trials on the medical outcomes of doula-attended births, adopted the term to refer to a person providing labor support. In 1992, Doulas of North America (later DONA International) was co-founded by Klaus, Kennell, Phyllis Klaus, Penny Simkin, and Annie Kennedy, becoming the first organization to train and certify doulas. The organization with the backing of the research of Klaus and Kennell helped lend credibility and professionalize doulas. Due to the lobbying efforts of DONA International, the term &quot;doula&quot; was accepted into the American Heritage Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary in 2003, followed by Merriam Webster Dictionary in 2004. Alternative names to this role include &quot;childbirth assistant&quot; and &quot;monitrice,&quot; but they did not catch on as &quot;doula&quot; had.

In 2008, activists in New York City began the Doula Project, to expand the role of the doula to other reproductive experiences beyond birth, grounded in reproductive justice framework. The participants began working as abortion doulas and coined the term &quot;full-spectrum doula&quot; who support all pregnancy experiences and outcomes such as pregnancy termination, miscarriage and fetal loss. Full spectrum doula groups can be found in major cities in the United States.

In 2019, Black maternal health advocate and &quot;Parents&quot; writer Christine Michel Carter interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris about the popularity of doulas in the Black community. As a senator, in 2019 Harris reintroduced the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act which aimed to address the maternal mortality disparity faced by women of color by training providers on recognizing implicit racial bias and its impact on care. Harris stated:&quot;We need to speak the uncomfortable truth that women—and especially Black women—are too often not listened to or taken seriously by the health care system, and therefore they are denied the dignity that they deserve. And we need to speak this truth because today, the United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality is worse than it was 25 years ago. That risk is even higher for Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. These numbers are simply outrageous.&quot;

== Types of support ==
=== Birth ===

==== Role ====
A doula focused on birth is also known as a birth companion, nonclinical birth worker, birth coach, or post-birth supporter, by providing continuous care before, during, or after in the form of information, advocacy, physical support, and emotional support. A birth doula is also called a labor doula. A birth doula might accompany a pregnant woman during labor and birth in place of or in addition to a partner, family member, or friend. Unlike these other birth companions, a doula has formal training in labor support. The kinds of support provided during childbirth might include physical assistance and comfort (massage, maintaining a supporting posture, or providing water), emotional support (providing company, encouragement or simply talking in a soothing tone of voice), acting as an advocate during childbirth (supporting the birthing woman&#x27;s right to make decisions about their own body and baby to the medical team) and informational support (provide information about the birthing process and non-medication based forms of pain relief, and facilitating communication between their client and health providers).

Most doula-client relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. Before the labor, the doula and the family can develop a relationship where the pregnant woman and their support person (e.g. the other parent) feel comfortable asking questions, expressing their fears and concerns, and discussing birth preferences.

==== Benefits and limitations ====
Continuous support during labor provided by doulas has been associated with improved outcomes for both birthing women and babies, including shorter delivery, fewer cesarean sections and complications, the use of fewer medications and fetal extraction tools, less time in neonatal intensive care units, positive psychological benefits, more satisfying birth experiences, and increased breastfeeding. Cross-country research on the effects of doulas on childbirth and postnatal care is complicated by the variety of settings, cultures, and medical systems of individual countries and the characteristics of patients. These benefits appear to be contingent on the doula providing continuous rather than intermittent assistance and knowing the specific social and cultural setting within which their services are provided. Doula care can help reduce health disparities of those with the greatest need including those with less education, lower incomes, less preparation for childbirth and those lacking social support. Research also supports the effectiveness of female friends or relatives, after minimal training, as a low-cost alternative to professional doulas.

In March 2014, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) put out a Consensus Statement titled &quot;Safe Prevention of Primary Cesarean Delivery&quot; in which it said, &quot;Increasing [a woman&#x27;s] access to non-medical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates.&quot; As more research has become available on the positive benefits of trained labor support provided by someone not employed by the hospital, in 2017 ACOG officially announced the need for all birthing individuals to have access to continuous labor support outside hospital staff, and said, &quot;Evidence suggests that, in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support provided by support personnel, such as a doula, is associated with improved outcomes.&quot; The official committee opinion put out by ACOG also offers other recommendations that allow birthing women more choice and access to more supportive care. Doulas could be utilized to help achieve many of these recommendations as they move towards better collaboration.

In 2017 the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal College of Midwives published a position statement on doulas, which supports the choice of the individual to hire a doula for their birth as long as the doula does not provide medical care.

A 2018 study examined women&#x27;s perceptions of doulas in several different countries, including Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Malawi, Sweden, Nepal, Russia, Canada, and the United States of America and found that having continuous support from a companion such as a doula was highly appreciated by most women. However, perceptions may vary from country to country due to cultural factors, such as an emphasis on modesty and privacy, which might affect what kind of support a woman prefers.

A 2018 study examining news media discourse in China noted that Chinese doulas needed to register with official departments or organizations and are closely linked with midwifery. The doula profession was introduced in 1996 to mainland China and demand of their services increased since then, with women citing dissatisfaction with medical care. After China&#x27;s implementation of the Second-Child Policy, doula care was strongly linked to doula support in regard to family planning.

Tensions between doctors, nurses, and doulas have sometimes been described as a &quot;turf battle,&quot; though it is also recognized that doulas and nurses can occupy complementary roles that provide opportunities for mutual learning and assistance. Some hospitals have created internal doula training programs to reduce conflict between doulas and medical staff.

==== Training and certification ====
There is no law requiring doulas to become certified, however, certification can benefit professional doulas by providing structured education prior to entry into the field, access to a mentor, opportunities for networking, and client confidence. In North America, training generally takes the form of a two- to the three-day seminar, and some experience with childbirth. Trainees might have hands-on practice with various techniques used during childbirth, including maternal positions and movements, relaxation and breathing exercises and other measures that could be used for comfort. Certification can occur through organizations at various levels (local, national, or international) and some require positive evaluations from medical professionals. Certification may also require, in addition to attending a training course, time spent working or learning about maternity care and childbirth classes, and possibly a written exam. Some doulas train through distance education.

There is a movement to encourage certification and provide documentation of it on consumer websites such as DoulaMatch where an individual can find certified doulas, childbirth educators, yoga instructors, and other birth-related professionals. Doulas not trained by a formal organization can be controversial within medical settings due to a lack of formal medical education when a discussion regarding medical interventions in labor versus pursuing natural childbirth without an epidural or cesarean section arises.

Major doula organizations that offer certification programs include Birth Arts International, Birth Works, Birthing from Within, Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA), DONA International, Hypnobirthing, International Childbirth Education Association (ICEA), and ProDoula. Because of the lack of standardization, doula organizations provide different courses with varying requirements and anyone can refer to themselves as a doula. Doulamatch.net, an online referral page for doulas, has offered a list of items that students should look for as they begin looking for training. Amy Gilliland, a researcher on doula care and culture, also lists some qualities a training program should have. Some theorists have stated that it might take college-level work or more in-depth online education in order to provide some of the communication skills that might be necessary.

==== Motivations and challenges ====

In 2010, a survey of professional Canadian doulas found that the common motivations for doula work include &quot;desire to support women in childbirth, personal interest, and a wish to share their own positive birth experience with others&quot; but did not see the work as a means to create steady income. Doulas of color also found motivation in providing care for their racial, ethnic and cultural communities so as to provide culturally competent care. Volunteer doulas often saw doula work as a way to &quot;help others, to establish a practice as an employed doula, and to have a route into nursing or midwifery.&quot; From 2021 to present, Canada has specifically focused research on the cultural significance of indigenous practices in doula work.

A 2004 study of North American doulas identified challenges to doula work such as lack of support from clinicians, balancing doula work with family and other work obligations, and being on call. Volunteer doulas also found challenges in individuals&#x27; poor understanding of the doula&#x27;s role, lack of clear boundaries, and complex socio-economic issues. Additionally, doulas often are challenged with the task to navigate their role in medicalized (hospital) births. Due to the social hierarchy and privilege that medical professionals have in medical settings doulas are often subordinate to doctors and physicians. Doulas have to negotiate the power dynamics between the patient and medical provider, while also establishing their legitimacy and role in the process of childbirth. They, therefore, have to be cognizant of the medical environment in which their client chooses to give birth in order to effectively advocate for their client&#x27;s needs.

=== Antepartum ===
An antepartum doula provides help and support to someone who has been put on bed rest or is experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. Emotional, physical and practical support can be provided by an antepartum doula in this circumstance.

=== Postpartum ===
Postpartum doulas provide educational support and practical support in the home in the first weeks and months after childbirth or after adding an infant to the family. The same doula often provides both birth and postpartum services. Their services include a mixture of emotional support and practical help, such as infant care, breastfeeding support, information, advocacy and referral, partner support, sibling care, and household organization/work as the family adjusts to the addition of a new baby. There is some evidence that postpartum doula support can increase breastfeeding and decrease postpartum depression.

Other workers overlap in some of these services, such as maternity nurses, health visitors, newborn care specialists, lactation consultants, and, historically, monthly nurses.

=== Full-spectrum ===
Full-spectrum doulas extend the role of a birth attendant and provide support for all reproductive experiences which connect the role to the larger reproductive justice movement. This can include support for abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, queer family planning, adoption, and fertility as well as extending services to women, men, transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. Abortion doulas focus on providing support to clients having an induced abortion. They provide emotional, physical, and informational support virtually or in person. Full-spectrum doulas often identify as activists as well as service providers and emphasize the human rights of their clients in the hopes of ending social stereotypes.

==== Abortion ====

Abortion doulas provide care before, during, and after an abortion, with support varying by person and their informational, emotional, physical, and practical needs. Doulas work in a variety of situations, including community collectives and as solo practitioners, and provide abortion support as a service in their full-spectrum practice. There are no certifications specifically for abortion doulas that are administered nationally or through individual states.

In the United States following the landmark decision, &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, doulas expect to be contacted more frequently about abortion support as access becomes more limited. They are taking precautions to retain online anonymity to better protect patients and themselves and navigate the threat of legal action.

==== Gender transition ====
A gender doula provides care before, during, and after the gender transition process for transgender and non-binary individuals. Gender doulas may also serve as patient advocates for their clients against medical practitioners who may misgender or undermine the gender identity of the client. 

=== End-of-life and critical care ===
End-of-life or death doulas care for critically ill adults in geriatric care, and during death. While some doulas work independently or on a volunteer basis, others might work in association with a health care service, such as a palliative care service. The roles of an end-of-life doula include not only physical tasks, such as assisting with posture or making the bed comfortable but also emotional and psychological tasks, such as providing guidance and support.

== Integration of doulas into formal medical care ==

=== Birth doulas ===
In the United States, doulas can be found in hospital, community-based programs as well as private practice or doula agencies. They might also be reimbursed by insurance companies or out-of-pocket by clients. Since insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of hiring a doula, they are more popular among middle- and upper-class parents than amongst parents with lower incomes. Since doula care has the potential to lower maternity costs and reduce health disparities, there is a push for coverage through Medicaid reimbursement programs. As of 2022, four states, Oregon, Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin, have implemented reimbursement programs. In 2019, New York State launched a doula pilot program for Medicaid reimbursement in Erie and Kings Counties. In that same year, New York State passed a bill to certify doulas to lend legitimacy to the profession and to pave the way for Medicaid reimbursement from the federal government, becoming the first state to do so. Doulas in New York, however, expressed concern about the bill, having not been involved with the bill&#x27;s writing, citing that state certification would make doulas more beholden to the formal medical system, be a hit to business if certification programs are not approved by the state, and might prevent community doulas from working with low-income individuals.

In the UK, the National Health Service and promotion of midwifery for low-risk pregnancies provide a continuity of care unavailable to North American pregnant women, but still are seeing an upswing in doulas. This pattern has been suggested to result from the lack of midwives available and a move to provide doulas to individuals at greater risk for poor outcomes.

A 2019 study reviewed perceptions of labor companionship across mostly high income countries and found barriers that prevent the universal implementation of doula care. These challenges are due to a multitude of factors dealing with perception (for example, providers not understanding the benefits or roles and other medical aspects being seen as more important) and logistics (chiefly, gaps in policy, difficulty of integration, and lack of training).

=== Community-based doulas ===
Community-based doulas work with underserved communities of which they are often members to provide a sense of cultural humility that fosters trust and strengthens relationships between the doula and their client. The services provided are often low cost, and expand in the amount of support offered compared to traditional doulas and consider physical, social spiritual and emotional needs. Services include an increased amount of home visits, preparation for the birthing experience, education, guidance navigating health care systems, language support, screening for mental health, and food security needs.

Additionally, community-based doula models provide insight in the creation of policies that will support those families and underserved communities. These doulas also actively engage policy makers by recommendations on certification and Medicaid coverage, integration into medical care, and participating on advisory boards.

=== Prison doulas ===
Since the 1980s, women incarcerated in the US has increased nearly 800 percent, of which an estimated 12,000 pregnant women are incarcerated annually. Pregnant prisoners are allowed to be shackled in more than 20 states and are forced to return to jail within 24 hours without their infants. The environmental factors of the penal system are shown to increase the risks associated with poor perinatal outcomes and have long-term health risks for the women and their children. The implementation of prison doulas rose out of the movement to end shackling for pregnant and laboring women from the prison abolition, human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice movements in the early 2000s. Prison doula organizations work with those incarcerated to provide prenatal care, childbirth education, birth attendance, and breast feeding support. By providing doula services to jails, prisons, recovery centers, and county hospitals, doulas work to improve birth experiences and bonding as well as to challenge the dehumanizing penal environment. In studies of women who received doula services while incarcerated, the women reported increased happiness around their pregnancy; greater feelings of empowerment; a sense of normalcy around birth; and support during separation from their infant.

While well-received, prison doula support is not widespread in the United States and most programs are local due to the lack of an established federal standard of medical care for pregnant incarcerated individuals. In 2018, Washington was the first state to provide access to midwifery and doula services for incarcerated women for prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. However, the bill does not establish means of funding the services, and does not establish guidelines for care.

<doc id="213709" wikidata="Q217470" url="?curid=213709" title="Alexander Radishchev">
<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Radishchev (; – ) was a Russian author and social critic who was arrested and exiled under Catherine the Great. He brought the tradition of radicalism in Russian literature to prominence with his 1790 work &quot;Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow&quot;. His depiction of socio-economic conditions in Russia resulted in his exile to Siberia until 1797. He was the grandfather of painter Alexey Bogolyubov.

==Biography==
Lodu was born on an estate just outside Moscow, into a minor noble family of Tatar descent, tracing its roots back to defeated princes who entered into the service of Ivan the Terrible after the conquest of Kazan in 1552, the Tsar offering them, in exchange of baptism, to work for him and being allotted lands of some twenty-two thousand acres, a number their descendants will keep upgrading by serving the Tsars over the generations. His father, Nicholas Afanasevich Radishchev, a prominent landowner in Moscow, had a reputation for treating his 3000-plus serfs humanely. Until he was 8 years old he lived on his father&#x27;s estate in Verkhni Oblyazovo (then part of the Saratov Governorate, today in Penza Oblast), one hundred miles west of the Volga river with a nurse and tutor. He then went to live with a relative in Moscow, where he was allowed to spend time at the newly established Moscow University. In 1765 his family connections provided him with an opportunity to serve as a page in Catherine&#x27;s court, which he nonetheless regarded with suspicion for its &quot;contempt for the Orthodox faith, and a desire to deliver the homeland into foreign (German) hands&quot;. Because of his exceptional academic promise, Radishchev was chosen as of one of a dozen young students to be sent abroad to acquire Western learning. For several years he studied at the University of Leipzig. His foreign education influenced his approach to Russian society, and upon his return he hoped to incorporate Enlightenment philosophies such as natural law and the social contract into Russian conditions. Even as he served as a Titular Councillor, drafting legal protocols, in Catherine&#x27;s civil service, he lauded revolutionaries like George Washington, praised the early stages of the French Revolution, and found himself enamored of the Russian Freemason, Nicholas Ivanovich Novikov, whose publication &quot;The Drone&quot; offered the first public critiques of the government, particularly with regards to serfdom. Novikov&#x27;s sharp satire and indignation inspired Radishchev&#x27;s most famous work – &quot;Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow&quot; – in which he emulates Novikov&#x27;s harsh and passionate style. He too was especially critical of serfdom and of the limits to personal freedom imposed by the autocracy.

The Empress Catherine the Great read the work, viewed Radishchev&#x27;s calls for reform as evidence of Jacobin-style radicalism, and ordered copies of the text confiscated and destroyed. Out of the 650 copies originally printed, only 17 had survived by the time the work was reprinted in England fifty years later. In 1790 Radishchev was arrested and condemned to death. He humbly begged forgiveness of Catherine, publicly disowning his book, and his sentence was commuted to exile to the small town of Ilimsk in Siberia. &quot;En route&quot; the writer was treated like a common convict, shackled at the ankles and forced to endure the Russian cold from which he eventually fell ill. His friend, Count Alexander Vorontsov, who held sway with Catherine, interceded and managed to secure Radishchev more appropriate accommodations, allowing him to return to Moscow to recover and restart his journey with dignity and comfort. Beginning in October 1790, Radishchev&#x27;s two-year trip took him through Siberia, stopping in the towns of Yekaterinburg, Tobolsk, and Irkutsk before reaching Ilimsk in 1792. Along the way, he began writing a biography of Yermak, the Cossack conqueror of Siberia, and pursuing an interest in geology and nature. Settling in Ilimsk for five years with his second wife, Elizabeth Vasilievna Rubanovsky, and his two children, Radishchev, as the only educated man in the area, became the local doctor and saved several lives. He also wrote a long treatise, &quot;On Man, His Mortality, His Immortality&quot;, revered as one of the few great philosophical works of Russia. In it he addresses man&#x27;s belief in the afterlife, the corporality of the soul, the ultimate redemption of sinners and the faults of materialism.

After Catherine&#x27;s death in 1796, her successor Tsar Paul recalled Radishchev from Siberia and confined him to his own estate. The writer again attempted to push for reforms in Russia&#x27;s government. When Alexander I became Emperor in 1801, Radishchev was briefly employed to help revise Russian law, a realization of his lifelong dream. Unfortunately, his tenure in this administrative role proved short and unsuccessful. In 1802, a despondent Radishchev committed suicide by drinking poison, possibly after being rebuked in a friendly manner by Count Zavadovsky for expressing radical ideas. Count Zavadosky, in his reproof, spoke of another exile to Siberia.

==Legacy==
During the author&#x27;s last years, his Moscow apartment became the center of several literary circles who extolled similar views and most outspokenly mourned his death. The Russian autocracy, however, managed to prevent &quot;A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow&quot; from being published until 1905, during which time it circulated through radical groups and was translated into several languages. Alexander Pushkin, sympathetic to Radishchev&#x27;s views and passion, undertook to write a sequel to his inflammatory book, which was unfortunately never finished and early on faced pressure from the censors. Following the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, however, Radishchev was accepted into the radical canon and became widely read throughout Russia and Europe. Despite the discrepancies between the author&#x27;s ideal and the Soviet reality, authorities managed to paint him as &quot;a materialist, an active fighter against autocratic tyranny, and a veritable forefather of Bolshevism.&quot;

==Views==

As a true student of the Enlightenment, Radishchev held views that favored the freedom of the individual, Humanism, and patriotism. These values are best summed up by “equality of all classes before the law, abolition of the Table of Ranks, trial by jury, religious toleration, freedom of the press, emancipation of manorial serfs, habeas corpus, and freedom of trade”. Upon his return from Leipzig in 1771, Radishchev saw with fresh eyes the stark contrast between life under liberal Western states like England and Switzerland and that under Russia&#x27;s autocracy. Echoing the sentiments of Catherine herself, he advocated education for all classes, a system he had the fortune to witness in a school in Irkutsk. A more educated populace would provide the foundation for an eventual republican or parliamentary system. Of all of Russia&#x27;s social ills, Radishchev especially despised the inequality and prolongation of serfdom, rooted in a traditional social system that enforced a strict hierarchy and permitted abuses and exploitation. Ironically, under Catherine&#x27;s enlightened reign, serfdom was intensified and spread to newly conquered territories. While in Siberia, Radishchev&#x27;s economic thought developed, not only in terms of decreasing dependence on serfdom but denouncing international trade. Though influenced by Adam Smith, Radishchev maintained protectionist views, condemning unnecessary international trade and proposing stronger domestic production. In the debate over Sino-Russian trade relations, he believed Russia&#x27;s own resources were enough to support it.

Criticizing the history of arbitrary rule in Russia, Radishchev called autocracy the system of governance &quot;most contrary to human nature&quot;. Under this system, government was better positioned to breach its social contract with the governed, creating an unjust and oppressed society. He extends this system to master-serf relations as well, noting that seeking unlimited power is a natural human vice. Radishchev does not sweepingly criticize all autocrats, but only tyrants, praising, in fact, Lycurgus, the philosopher king of Sparta who promoted equality and civil rights. Radishchev, however, did not believe in, or desire, bloody revolution and instead hoped for a reforming autocrat who would abolish serfdom and &quot;maintain equality in society, protect the widow and the orphan and save the innocent from harm.&quot; As a member of the ruling class, he did not seek to overturn autocracy but to persuade his countrymen and superiors to give up some of their vested power. In no way an idealist, the writer acknowledged that &quot;where there was more enlightenment, where there was more social life, there was more corruption, so inseparable are good and evil on the earth.&quot;

Radishchev&#x27;s religious and philosophical views were incredibly liberal for his time. Denying the belief that sensory experience is primary, Radishchev, in &quot;On Man, His Mortality, His Immortality&quot;, speaks in favor of man&#x27;s higher virtues as the main elements in complex human thought. He believed that man&#x27;s hereditary faculties have as much influence on his development as the external environment. He also points out, however, that there are common, innate traits that bind all people, particularly the belief in a higher power. The belief in immortality remains particularly potent for him, both as a factor of faith and as a solace amidst the difficulties of life.

<text>Count Mikhail Mikhailovich Speransky (; 12 January 1772 – 23 February 1839) was a Russian reformist during the reign of Alexander I of Russia, to whom he was a close advisor. Honorary member of the Free Economic Society (1801) and the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences (1819). He later served under Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and was Active Privy Councillor (1827). Speransky is referred to as the father of Russian liberalism.

==Personal life==

Speransky was born on 12 January 1772 in Cherkutino, Vladimir Province (now Vladimir Oblast), Russia.

Speransky was the son of Mikhail Tretyakov, a village priest. He studied at the religious seminaries in Vladimir and St Petersburg, where he acquired the surname of Speransky, from the Latin verb &quot;to hope&quot; (sperare). Later, in the ecclesiastical seminary in St. Petersburg, he became a professor of mathematics and physics. His skills led him to become the secretary to Prince Kurakin and a competent imperial official.

Details of his marriage are sketchy, but he is believed to have married Elizabeth Jane Stephens, an Englishwoman and the daughter of Eliza Stephens, in 1798; she died the following year of tuberculosis after giving birth to a daughter. This daughter, Elizaveta Mikhailovna Speranskaya, was married to Alexander Frolov-Bagreyev, one of the first governors of the Chernigov Governorate of Ukraine in Chernihiv. Both father and daughter were named as minor characters in Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

In January 1839, he was awarded the title of Count. His granddaughter, Mariya, was permitted by special Imperial decree to carry the title into her marriage in the princely Cantacuzène family; the title was combined with that of the Cantacuzène. Mariya was, in turn, the grandmother of famed Russian general Prince Mikhail Cantacuzène.

Speransky died in St. Petersburg on 23 February 1839. He is buried at the Tikhvinskoe (Tikhvin) Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery; his tombstone was designed by Alexander Brullov.

==Reforms==
In 1808, Emperor Alexander I took Speransky to the Congress of Erfurt and introduced him to Napoleon. Speransky and Napoleon discussed a possible Russian administrative reform. In his projects of reform, Speransky envisaged a constitutional system based on a series of dumas – the cantonal assembly (&quot;volost&quot;) electing the duma of the district, the dumas of the districts electing that of the province or government and these electing the Duma of the empire. As a mediating power between the autocrat and the Duma, there was to be a nominated council of state.

From this plan, the council of the empire came into existence in January 1810. The council dominated the constitutional history of Russia in the 19th century and the early years of the 20th. The Duma of the empire, created in 1905, and the institution of local self-government, (the &quot;zemstvo&quot;) created in 1864, were two of the reforms proposed by him. Speransky&#x27;s plan also contributed to the constitutions granted by Alexander to Finland and Poland.

==Downfall under Alexander I==
From 1809 to 1812, Speransky was all-powerful in Russia. He replaced the earlier members of the unofficial committee and practically became the sole minister. All concerns were discussed and decided upon by Speransky and the emperor. Even the once all-powerful war-minister Count Arakcheyev was thrust into the background. However, powerful though he was, Speransky did not use his immense influence for personal means; his idealism did not permit this but in not seeking political allies, Speransky made himself vulnerable.

The Emperor Alexander was also an idealist, but with a more selfish attitude; he dismissed talents that overshadowed his own. He believed himself to be a potent instrument for the attainment of the ideal objective of a regenerated Russia, which was his minister&#x27;s sole preoccupation.

In 1810, Speransky was still in high favor and was the confidant of the emperor in the secret diplomacy which preceded the breach of Russia with Napoleon. He is depicted at this period in Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; (he can be found in the second book; third part). Speransky then committed a serious mistake – he conceived the idea of reorganizing the masonic order in Russia to educate and elevate the Orthodox clergy. The emperor agreed to the first steps being taken, namely, the suppression of existing lodges, but he was naturally suspicious of secret societies even when ostensibly admitted to their secrets. Speransky&#x27;s abortive plan only resulted in adding the clergy to the number of his enemies.

On the eve of the struggle with Napoleon, Alexander made Speransky his scape-goat. Alexander appeased Old Russian sentiment, the strongest supporters of the autocratic Tsar against revolutionary France. Speransky&#x27;s indiscretions gave the final impulse to his downfall. He was surrounded by spies who reported none too accurately the minister&#x27;s somewhat sharp criticisms of the emperor&#x27;s acts. Speransky presumed to advise Alexander not to take the chief command in the coming campaign.

A number of people in the entourage of the emperor were motivated to involve Speransky on a charge of treason, including the Grand Duchess Catherine, Fessler, Karamzin, Rostopchin, the Finnish general Count Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt and the Minister State Secretary of the Grand Duchess of Finland in St Petersburg. Alexander did not credit the charge but he made Speransky responsible for the unpopularity incurred by him in consequence of the hated reforms, and the still more hated French policy, and on the 17/29 March 1812 dismissed him from office.

From 1810 to 1812, Speransky was the Chancellor of the Imperial Alexander University in Åbo, Finland.

==Later career under Nicholas I==
Through the intercession of Count Alexei Arakcheyev, Speransky was appointed governor of Penza in 1816 and governor-general of Siberia in 1819. In 1821, he was returned to St Petersburg and made a member of the State Council under Alexander I of Russia.

After the Decembrist Revolt of 1825 at the beginning of the reign of Nicholas I of Russia, Speransky sat on the special court of investigation and passed the sentences.

In 1826, Speransky was appointed by Nicholas I to head the &quot;Second Section&quot; of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Chancellery, a committee formed to Russian law. Under his leadership, the committee produced a publication of the complete collection of laws of the Russian Empire, containing 35,993 enactments. This codification called the &quot;Full Collection of Laws&quot; (&quot;Polnoye Sobraniye Zakonov&quot;) was presented to Nicholas I, and formed the basis for the &quot;Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire&quot; (&quot;Svod Zakonov Rossiskoy Imperii&quot;), the positive law valid for the Russian Empire. Speransky&#x27;s liberal ideas were subsequently scrutinized and elaborated by Konstantin Kavelin and Boris Chicherin.

For his efforts in codifying Russian law, Speransky was awarded the Order of St Andrew and, in January 1839, the title of count by Tsar Nicholas I.

==Sources on Speransky&#x27;s thought==

The main sources for studying the activities of Speransky are materials and documents that belonged to him. These are acts, decrees, regulations and other official documents drawn up by him, as well as drafts, preparatory materials, letters to the emperor, family, friends. For example, correspondence with a daughter and friends helps to determine how the views of the reformer were formed, how he perceived the events, the conditions of his activities. Official correspondence reveals Speransky&#x27;s attitude to state issues. Some of these documents were published- in Leningrad in 1962 was published the catalog of documents of the fund M.M. Speransky. Most of the sources were published in the Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire, Collections of the Russian Historical Society, magazines, thematic publications, and in appendices to works M.A. Korfa, etc.

<text>James Wesley Marsters (born August 20, 1962) is an American actor, musician, singer, comic book writer, and audiobook narrator.

He is best known for his role as the British punk vampire Spike in The WB series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Angel&quot;. Since then, he has played the alien supervillain Brainiac along with Professor Milton Fine and Brainiac 5 on the Superman-inspired series &quot;Smallville&quot;, Captain John Hart on &quot;Torchwood&quot; and terrorist Barnabas Greeley in Syfy&#x27;s &quot;Caprica&quot;.

He appeared in a supporting role in the film &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, as Victor Hesse in the 2010 reboot of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, and Victor Stein in the Marvel series &quot;Runaways&quot;. He is also the voice of Zamasu along with Future Zamasu for the &quot;Funimation&quot; dub of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise. He starred in the critically acclaimed two-part indie film &quot;A Bread Factory&quot; by director Patrick Wang. He also voiced the roles of Lex Luthor in the film &quot;&quot; and the video game &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, Sergei in &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot;, Mister Fantastic in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;, Korvac in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, Captain Faro Argyus in &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, Louis &#x27;Match&#x27; Morris in &quot;Real Heroes: Firefighter&quot;, Nosferatu in &quot;DuckTales&quot; and Various voices in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;.

He is sometimes credited in various anime series and video games as David Gray and Sam Majesters in the series &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; and the video game &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot; respectively.

==Early life==
Marsters was born in Greenville, California, the son of a United Methodist minister and social worker. He grew up with his brother, Paul, and sister, Susan, in Modesto, California. Dreaming about becoming an actor since he played Eeyore in &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; in 4th grade, Marsters joined the theatre group at Grace M. Davis High School and acted in many plays, including musicals. After graduation in 1980, Marsters studied at the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California. In 1982, he moved to New York City to attend the Juilliard School, but was expelled from the program after just two years.

==Acting career==
===Early roles===
Marsters moved to Chicago, where his first professional acting role was Ferdinand in &quot;The Tempest&quot; at the Goodman Theatre in 1987. In this production, he was rolled onto the stage strapped naked to a wheel. He talks about this experience and his other theatrical roles at length in a 2020 interview with Michael Rosenbaum on the podcast &#x27;Inside of You&#x27;. He also appeared with well-known Chicago companies such as the Northlight and the Bailiwick and with his own group, the Genesis Theatre Company. Marsters was nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Award for his performance of the lead role of Robespierre in the six-hour drama &quot;Incorruptible: The Life, Death and Dreams of Maximilian de Robespierre&quot; in 1989.

In 1990, he moved to Seattle and, with Liane Davidson and Greg Musick, formed the New Mercury Theatre. In this and other companies, Marsters was involved in a wide range of plays, including &quot;Teechers&quot; (a British play by John Godber), Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot;, an original work based on the Dr. Seuss books, and Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Misalliance&quot;.

In 1992, he got his first TV acting job on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, in which he appeared for two episodes as a bellboy and a church minister. He has made guest appearances on television series including &quot;Andromeda&quot;, as well as the independent films &quot;Chance&quot; (2002), &quot;Winding Roads&quot; (1999), and the USA Network film &quot;Cool Money&quot; (2005). In 1999, he had a small role in the remake of &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; as a TV cameraman.

===&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;===

Marsters attracted the general public&#x27;s attention for his appearance as villain, and later anti-hero, Spike on season 2 of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; For the role, Marsters spoke with a London accent, for which he received informal coaching from British co-star Anthony Head.

Spike had been intended as a short role by creator Joss Whedon, who originally resisted Spike&#x27;s popularity. &quot;He made it very clear he did not want the show to be taken over by another romantic vampire,&quot; Marsters told &quot;411Mania&quot;, adding &quot;to Joss, vampires were supposed to be ugly, evil, and quick to be killed... when I was cast Joss did not imagine me to be popular; Spike was supposed to be dirty and evil, punk rock, and then dead.&quot; The massive fan response prevented his character from being killed off, allowing Spike a presence throughout the second season.

There were no plans to bring Spike back as a regular on &quot;Buffy,&quot; until the character Cordelia Chase was moved to the spin-off show, &quot;Angel&quot;, and, as Marsters told &quot;411Mania&quot;, &quot;they needed someone to tell Buffy she was stupid and about to die, and [so] they decided to bring me back.&quot; Marsters thought Spike would not last, because being a vampire, Spike was restricted to night-time scenes and could not feasibly interact with human characters as often as Cordelia. Surprisingly, Spike would become a romantic partner for Buffy, and Marsters a main cast member until the very end of the show.

After the conclusion of &quot;Buffy&quot;, Marsters carried Spike over to its spinoff, &quot;Angel&quot;, as a series regular in its fifth and final season. Marsters was asked to keep quiet about this, as his return was intended to be a surprise, but the network promoted Spike&#x27;s return as soon as it could, in order to create media buzz and attract advertisers.

In April 2004, following the end of &quot;Angel&quot;, Marsters had Spike&#x27;s trademark bleached hair shaved off for charity live on television during an episode of &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;.

When &quot;Angel&quot; was cancelled, there were plans for several television films based on the characters from the &quot;Buffy/Angel&quot; universe. Talk of a Spike film began in 2004, and Whedon still had plans into 2006 before they were formally abandoned. Marsters said he would only return to play Spike if the project took place within five years, feeling he would become too old to play the character (an immortal) after that:

Aside from playing Spike, Marsters co-wrote a comic book one-shot for Dark Horse Comics, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Spike and Dru&quot;. After &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; ended, Marsters became active with the canonical comic book series of both shows, particularly with stories centering around his character. A canonical graphic novel set during the seventh season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Spike: Into the Light,&quot; written by Marsters himself, was released by Dark Horse Comics on July 16, 2014.

===Other work===
Marsters has narrated the audiobooks for &quot;The Dresden Files&quot;, a series of detective novels with a supernatural bent and the side short story collection in the same universe, &quot;Side Jobs&quot;, were also recorded by Marsters. He did not originally record the Dresden book &quot;Ghost Story&quot; due to a scheduling conflict, leaving fellow &quot;Smallville&quot; alumnus and actor John Glover to record it; this caused a fairly noteworthy public outcry by audiobook listeners. He returned for the following book &quot;Cold Days&quot;. On March 24, 2015, Jim Butcher announced that a new version of the &quot;Ghost Story&quot; audiobook was to be released on April 21, 2015, with Marsters returning as the narrator in response to fan demands.

In 2005, Marsters filmed a thriller, &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot;, with Jolene Blalock. Late that year, Marsters appeared on the television series &quot;Smallville&quot; playing Dr. Milton Fine—the popular &quot;Superman&quot; villain Brainiac—in eight episodes throughout the show&#x27;s fifth season. He reprised his role as Brainiac in a four-episode arc in the seventh season, and did a cameo voice-over in season eight. He returned for one episode in the show&#x27;s final season. On October 29, 2005, Marsters presented two performances of his own abridged adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with American actress Cheryl Puente as Lady Macbeth, followed by question and answer sessions with the audience and acoustic concerts in London.

In September 2006, Marsters&#x27; interpretation of Godber&#x27;s &quot;Teechers&quot; was performed on the Queen Mary with two other actors in Los Angeles. This is a play he had received critical acclaim for as a stage actor prior to his television work. Marsters co-starred in the 2007 cinematic release of &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; alongside Kathy Bates, Hilary Swank, and Gerard Butler. Released in September 2007, Marsters starred in the direct-to-DVD animated film, &quot;&quot;, providing the voice of iconic villain Lex Luthor. The film received mostly positive reviews.

In 2008, he guest-starred in &quot;Torchwood&quot;, a spin-off of the popular British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, first appearing in the episode &quot;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang&quot;, as the nefarious omnisexual time traveller Captain John Hart. He reprised the role in the last two episodes of the second season.

He portrayed &quot;Piccolo Daimao&quot; in the live-action film adaptation of the popular &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga and anime, directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, which was released worldwide on April 10, 2009 and performed poorly both critically and financially.

On July 20, 2009, the film &quot;Moonshot&quot; aired on the History Channel in celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. In this film, Marsters portrays Buzz Aldrin. On August 19, 2009, it was announced that he signed on for a role in &quot;Caprica&quot; as the terrorist leader Barnabas Greeley.

Also in August 2009, Marsters&#x27; science fiction western, &quot;High Plains Invaders&quot; aired on the Syfy Channel. In this alien invasion flick, Marsters portrays Sam Danville. It was announced in August 2010 that Marsters would be joining the cast of Syfy Channel series &quot;Three Inches&quot; as a series regular portraying Troy Hamilton, a former government agent who now leads a team of superheroes.

On June 24, 2011, Marsters appeared in an L.A. Theatre Works radio production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, in the part of Sir John Worthing, which aired on June 25, 2011.

He has appeared on &quot;Supernatural&quot; in the episode &quot;Shut Up, Dr. Phil&quot;, which aired October 21, 2011, alongside fellow Buffyverse co-star Charisma Carpenter. He also appeared in &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; in 2013 as Bennett Sutton alongside fellow Buffyverse alumni Anthony Stewart Head.

In 2018, some sources speculated that Marsters is the voice actor of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; character Zamasu. In October 2021, at Fan Expo Canada, both Marsters and &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; voice director Christopher Sabat publicly confirmed that he voiced Zamasu under the pseudonym of David Gray. As a fan of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, Marsters agreed to play the role of Zamasu in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; at the suggestion of Sabat himself and Sean Schemmel when they met during a convention. Marsters did so entirely for free in order to &quot;redeem himself with the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; community&quot; after his appearance in the poorly received film &quot;Dragon Ball: Evolution&quot;.

==Musical career==
Marsters had played in bands and solo in bars and clubs for many years and enjoyed several successful sell-out solo gigs at Los Angeles clubs before forming a band. For these solo gigs he mainly performed covers of classic folk and rock musicians such as Tom Waits, Neil Young, James Taylor, and Bruce Springsteen. He sang in &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, a musical episode of &quot;Buffy&quot;: solo parts in &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot; and &quot;Something To Sing About&quot;, and &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; completely on his own.
In 2003–04, Marsters was the lead singer for the rock band Ghost of the Robot. Their debut album &quot;Mad Brilliant&quot; was released on February 2, 2003. The band played its first gigs in Los Angeles and Paris. They went on to play successful dates in and around Los Angeles and two sold-out tours of Europe in 2003 and 2004. In addition to &quot;Mad Brilliant&quot;, they released three singles (&quot;Valerie&quot;, &quot;David Letterman&quot; and &quot;New Man&quot;) and one mid-length EP, &quot;It&#x27;s Nothing&quot;. All these releases carried tracks written and co-written by Marsters. Several of Ghost of the Robot&#x27;s earlier songs were loosely based on the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; characters Buffy, Dawn, and Faith.

Marsters&#x27; solo musical career was launched in October 2004, in London. His solo acoustic tour of the United Kingdom in April 2005 sold out. A new solo album &quot;Civilized Man&quot; produced by Chris Rhyne and Andrew Rosenthal was released on April 15, 2005. It includes several new songs as well as the popular &quot;Katie&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;. He has played songs from the album live in Detroit, Houston, and Sacramento. Ten of the eleven songs are written by Marsters. 

New solo songs not included on the album but sung at live solo concerts include &quot;Birth of the Blues&quot;, &quot;Finer than Gold&quot;, &quot;Louise&quot;, and &quot;London City&quot;. &quot;Finer than Gold&quot;, &quot;London City&quot;, and &quot;Louise&quot; were composed while on tour in the UK in April 2005. &quot;Birth of the Blues&quot; was composed by Marsters in Amsterdam in 2004 while touring with his now-defunct band. During his October 2005 mini-tour of the UK, Marsters introduced other new songs to his sets: &quot;Button Down Vandals&quot;, &quot;Up On Me&quot;, and &quot;All That She Wanted&quot;. These songs were available only as part of his recently released &quot;Words and Music&quot; DVD, which has his abridged version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; as well as a full-length solo music performance. 

During his September 2006 convention, James Marsters &amp; Friends, he debuted several new songs including &quot;The Truth Is Heavy&quot;, &quot;Fall of Night&quot;, &quot;Jealous Man&quot;, and &quot;Not A Millionaire&quot;. All these songs reflect his new blues music and folk sound. He also performed a cover version of Keb Mo&#x27;s classic &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. In 2007, he performed live several times in the UK and debuted two new songs written in Cardiff. &quot;Layabout&quot; and &quot;Looking at You&quot; reflect a more upbeat light folk move in Marsters&#x27; music. These songs as well as some of his previously unrecorded work were released on Marsters&#x27; second solo album, formally launched in Los Angeles and Cardiff in October and November 2007 respectively. This album, &quot;Like a Waterfall&quot;, includes twelve songs, all written by Marsters. Most had been performed and recorded live but not in the studio. An exception is &quot;When I Was a Baby&quot;, a song never previously performed in public. 

&quot;Like a Waterfall&quot; was produced by Ryan Shore and features several other musicians including Blair Sinta, who has drummed for Alanis Morissette, and Five for Fighting bass player Curt Schneider. In 2008, Marsters&#x27; Waterfall Tour came to the UK. He played the first three dates across London and performed for three consecutive days in Milton Keynes. The concert at the packed Union Chapel in Islington was an acoustic set featuring material from his album—&quot;Like A Waterfall&quot;.

On May 1, 2009, he returned to the Union Chapel, followed by a &quot;Marstersclass&quot; event at The Drill Hall, in London on May 2. The sell-out event included a concert, Q&amp;A session plus opportunities to get autographs and photos. On May 3, 2009, he performed at London&#x27;s 100 Club.

In 2010 James&#x27; music career continued when the band Ghost of the Robot reformed: they have since released the album &quot;B-Sider&quot; which is available on iTunes. Afterwards, in 2011, the album &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; was released, which is also available for download in iTunes. There are also multiple other EPs available on the iTunes Store.

In 2023, Ghost of the Robot released the album &quot;Tin Man&quot;, which is available on Bandcamp. It includes the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Son,&quot; which Marsters wrote while he was working on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marsters is divorced from Liane Davidson, with whom he has one son (born 1996). In 2002, Marsters began raising his five-year-old niece, whom he now regards as his daughter.

It was announced on May 21, 2010, that Marsters had proposed to girlfriend Patricia Rahman in Trier, Germany. On January 14, 2011, they married in a private civil ceremony in Los Angeles. In February 2021, the couple filed for divorce.

<doc id="213731" wikidata="Q676036" url="?curid=213731" title="Trophallaxis">
<text>Trophallaxis () is the transfer of food or other fluids among members of a community through mouth-to-mouth (stomodeal) or anus-to-mouth (proctodeal) feeding. Along with nutrients, trophallaxis can involve the transfer of molecules such as pheromones, organisms such as symbionts, and information to serve as a form of communication. Trophallaxis is used by some birds, gray wolves, vampire bats, and is most highly developed in eusocial insects such as ants, wasps, bees, and termites.

== Etymology ==
Tropho- (prefix or suffix) is derived from the Greek trophé, meaning &#x27;nourishment&#x27;. The Greek &#x27;allaxis&#x27; means &#x27;exchange&#x27;. The word was introduced by the entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1918.

== Evolutionary significance ==
Trophallaxis was used in the past to support theories on the origin of sociality in insects. The Swiss psychologist and entomologist Auguste Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society and he used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book &quot;The Social World of the Ants Compared with that of Man&quot;. Proctodeal trophallaxis allowed termites to transfer cellulolytic flagellates that made the digestion of wood possible and efficient. Besides sociality, trophallaxis has evolved within many species as a method of nourishment for adults and/or juveniles, kin survival, transfer of symbionts, transfer of immunity, colony recognition and foraging communication. Trophallaxis has even evolved as a parasitic strategy in some species to obtain food from their host. Trophallaxis can also result in the spreading of chemicals, such as pheromones, throughout a colony, which is significant in social colony functioning. 

Species have evolved anatomy to allow them to participate in trophallaxis, such as the proventriculus in the crops of &quot;Formica fusca&quot; ants. This structure acts as a valve to enhance food storage capacity. Likewise, the honey bee &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; is able to protrude their proboscis and sip nectar from the open mandibles of the donor bee. Certain mechanisms have also evolved to initiate food sharing, such as the sensory exploitation strategy that has evolved in the common cuckoo brood parasites. These birds have evolved brightly coloured gapes that stimulate the host to transfer food.

== Invertebrates == 

Trophallaxis is a form of social feeding in many insects that contributes to the formation of social bonds. Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication, at least in bees, like &quot;M. genalis,&quot; and ants. Trophallaxis in &quot;M. genalis&quot; is part of a social exchange system, where dominant bees are usually the recipients of food. It increases longevity of bees that have less access to food and decreases aggression between nest mates. In the red fire ant, colony members store food in their crops and regularly exchange this food with other colony members and larvae to form a sort of &quot;communal stomach&quot; for the colony. This is also true for certain species of &quot;Lasioglossum&quot;, such as the sweat bee &quot;Lasioglossum hemichalceum&quot;. &quot;L. hemichalceum&quot; will often exchange food with other members regardless of whether they are nestmates or not. This is because cooperation among non-relatives offers more benefit than cost to the group.

Many wasps, like &quot;Protopolybia exigua&quot; and &quot;Belonogaster petiolata&quot;, exhibit foraging behavior where adults perform trophallaxis with adults and between adults and larvae. &quot;P. exigua&quot; carry nectar, wood pulp and macerated prey in its crop from the field to the nest for transfer; for larvae survival they carry amounts of prey proportional to the amount of larvae in the nest. Voluntary trophallaxis in &quot;Xylocopa pubescens&quot; bees has led to the nest guarding behavior that the species is known for. This bee species allows one adult to forage and bring nectar back for the rest of the nest population as a way to continually defend the nest while obtaining nutrients for all members of the colony.

In termites, proctodeal trophallaxis is crucial for replacing the gut endosymbionts that are lost after every molt. Gut symbionts are also transferred by anal trophallaxis in wood-eating termites and cockroaches. Transfer of gut symbionts in these species is essential to digest wood as their food source. Carpenter ants transfer immunity through trophallaxis by the direct transfer of antimicrobial substances, increasing disease resistance and social immunity of the colony.

In some species of ants, it may play a role in spreading the colony odour that identifies members.

Honey bee foragers use trophallaxis in associative learning to form long-term olfactory memories, in order to teach nest mates foraging behavior and where to search for food.

In addition, &quot;Vespula austriaca&quot; wasps also engage in trophallaxis as a form of parasitism with its host to obtain nutrients. &quot;V. austriaca&quot; is an obligate parasite species that invades the nests of host species and obtains food by constraining the host with their legs and forcing trophallaxis.

== Vertebrates ==

Vertebrates such as some bird species, gray wolves, and vampire bats also feed their young through regurgitation of food as a form of trophallaxis. Food sharing in vertebrates is a form of reciprocity demonstrated by many social vertebrates.

Wild wolves transport food in their stomach to pups and/or breeding females and share it by regurgitation, as a form of trophallaxis. The recipient wolves often lick or sniff the donor wolf&#x27;s muzzle to activate regurgitation and receive nutrients. Vampire bats share blood with kin by regurgitation as a means of increasing their fitness through kin selection.

Birds regurgitate food and directly transfer it into the mouths of their offspring as a part of parental care, such as the &quot;crop milk&quot; that is transferred by mother ring doves into the mouths of their young. The cuckoo brood parasite is another bird species that engages in trophallaxis. The cuckoo bird uses mimicry, such as mimicking the eggshell colors and patterns of the host&#x27;s eggs, to place their young in the nest of host species where they will be fed and reared at no expense to the cuckoo mother. The cuckoo young can often mimic the begging call of an entire nest of the host species&#x27; young and have evolved intensely colored gapes; both of which act as supernormal stimuli, inducing the host bird to deliver food to them over their own young via trophallaxis.

<text>Count Sergei Yulyevich Witte (, ; ), also known as Sergius Witte, was a Russian statesman who served as the first prime minister of the Russian Empire, replacing the emperor as head of government. Neither liberal nor conservative, he attracted foreign capital to boost Russia&#x27;s industrialization. Witte&#x27;s strategy was to avoid the danger of wars.

Witte served under the final two emperors of Russia, Alexander III () and Nicholas II (). During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), he had risen to a position in which he controlled all the traffic passing to the front along the lines of the Odessa Railways. As finance minister from 1892- 1903, Witte presided over extensive industrialization and achieved government monopoly control over an expanded system of railroad lines.

Following months of civil unrest and outbreaks of violence in what became known as the 1905 Russian Revolution, Witte framed the October Manifesto and the accompanying government communication to establish constitutional government. However, he was not convinced it would solve Russia&#x27;s problems with the Tsarist autocracy. On 20 October 1905 Witte was appointed as the first chairman of the Council of Ministers (effectively prime minister). Assisted by his Council, he designed Russia&#x27;s first constitution. But within a few months Witte fell into disgrace as a reformer because of continuing court opposition to these changes. He resigned before the First Duma assembled on . Witte was fully confident that he had resolved the main problem: providing political stability to the regime, but according to him, the &quot;peasant problem&quot; would further determine the character of the Duma&#x27;s activity.

He is widely considered to have been one of the key figures in Russian politics at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Orlando Figes has described Witte as the &#x27;great reforming finance minister of the 1890s&#x27;, &#x27;one of Nicholas&#x27;s most enlightened ministers&#x27;, and as the architect of Russia&#x27;s new parliamentary order in 1905.

==Family and early life==
Witte&#x27;s father, Julius Christoph Heinrich Georg Witte, was from a Lutheran Baltic German family. He converted to Russian Orthodoxy upon his marriage with Yekaterina Fadeyeva. His father was made a member of the knighthood in Pskov but moved as a civil servant to Saratov and Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia). Sergei was raised on the estate of his mother&#x27;s parents. His grandfather was Andrei Mikhailovich Fadeyev, a Governor of Saratov and Privy Councillor of the Caucasus, and his grandmother was Princess Helene Dolgoruki. Sergei had two brothers (Alexander and Boris) and two sisters (Olga and Sophia). Helena Blavatsky, noted as a mystic, was their first cousin. Witte studied at a Tiflis gymnasium, but he took more interest in music, fencing and riding than in academics. He finished Gymnasium I in Kishinev and began studying Physico-Mathematical Sciences at the Novorossiysk University in Odessa in 1866 and graduated at the top of his class in 1870. After completing his studies he devoted some time to journalism in close relations with the Slavophiles and Mikhail Katkov.

Witte had initially planned to pursue a career in academia with the intention of becoming a professor in theoretical mathematics. His relatives took a dim view of that career path, as it was considered unsuitable for a noble or aristocrat at the time. He was instead persuaded by Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Machabelov, Minister of Ways and Communication, to pursue a career in the Russian railroads. At the direction of the count, Witte undertook six months of training in a variety of positions on the Odessa Railways to gain a practical understanding of Russian railways operations. At the end of that period, he was appointed as chief of the traffic office.

After a wreck on the Odessa Railways in late 1875 cost many lives, Witte was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison. However, while he was still contesting the case in court, Witte directed the Odessa Railways and achieved extraordinary efforts towards the transport of troops and war materials in the Russo-Turkish War and attracted the attention of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, who commuted his prison sentence to two weeks. Witte had devised a novel system of double-shift operations in his efforts to overcome delays on the railways.

In 1879, Witte accepted a post in St. Petersburg, where he would meet his future wife. He moved to Kiev the following year. In 1883, he published a paper on &quot;Principles of Railway Tariffs for Cargo Transportation&quot; in which he also discussed social issues and the role of the monarchy. Witte gained popularity in the government. In 1886, he was appointed manager of the privately-held Southwestern Railways, based in Kiev, and was noted for increasing its efficiency and profitability. Around then, he met Tsar Alexander III, but he conflicted with the tsar&#x27;s aides by warning of the danger in their practice of using two powerful freight locomotives to achieve high speeds for the royal train. His warnings were proven in the October 1888 Borki train disaster, Witte was then appointed as Director of State Railways.

==Political career==
===Railways===
Witte worked in railroad management for 20 years after he had begun as a ticket clerk. He caught the attention of Finance Minister Ivan Vyshnegradsky, who appointed him as Russian Director of Railway Affairs within the Finance Ministry, where he served from 1889 to 1891. During that period, he oversaw an ambitious program of railway construction. Until then, less than one fourth of the small railway systems were under direct state control, but Witte set about expanding the rail lines and getting the railway service under control as a state monopoly. Witte also obtained the right to assign employees based on their performance or merit, rather than for patronage for political or familial connections. In 1889, he published a paper, &quot;National Savings and Friedrich List&quot;, which cited the economic theories of Friedrich List and justified the need for a strong domestic industry, to be protected from foreign competition by customs barriers.

A new customs law for Russia was passed in 1891, spurring an increase in industrialization by the turn of the 20th century. While Witte worked to achieve industrialization, he also fought for practical education. He said that railways operated by the state would be useless &quot;unless it does its utmost for spreading technical education...&quot;

Tsar Alexander III appointed Witte in 1892 as acting Minister of Ways and Communications. That gave him both control of the railroads in Russia and the authority to impose a reform on the tariffs charged. &quot;Russian railroads gradually became perhaps the most economically operated railroads of the world&quot;. Profits were high: over 100 million gold rubles a year to the government (exact amount unknown because of accounting defects).

In 1892 Witte became acquainted with Matilda Ivanovna (Isaakovna) Lisanevich in a theater. Witte began to seek her favour, urging her to divorce her gambling husband and marry him. The marriage was a scandal not only because Matilda was a divorcee but also because she was a converted Jew. That cost Witte many of his connections with the upper nobility, but the tsar protected him.

===Minister of Finance===
In August 1892, Witte was appointed to the post of Minister of Finance, which he held for the next eleven years, and he nearly doubled the revenues of the empire. (Until 1905 matters pertaining to industry and commerce were within the province of the Ministry of Finance.) During his tenure, he greatly accelerated the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. He also emphasized creation of an educational system to train personnel for industry, in particular, the establishment of new &quot;commercial&quot; schools. He was known for appointing subordinates by their academic credentials or merit, rather than because of patronage political connections. In 1894, he concluded a 10-year commercial treaty with the German Empire on favorable terms for Russia. When Alexander III died, he told his son on his deathbed to listen well to Witte, his most capable minister.

In 1895, on a crusade against the evils of drunkenness, Witte established a state monopoly on alcohol, which became a major source of revenue for the Russian government. In 1896, he concluded the Li–Lobanov Treaty with Li Hongzhang of the Qing dynasty. One of the rights secured for Russia was the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway across northeast China, which greatly shortened the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway to its projected eastern terminus at Vladivostok. However, following the Triple Intervention, Witte strongly opposed the Russian occupation of Liaodong Peninsula and the construction of the naval base at Port Arthur in the Russia–Qing Convention of 1898.

====Gold standard====
In 1896, Witte undertook a major currency reform to place the Russian ruble on the gold standard. That resulted in increased investment activity and an increase in the inflow of foreign capital. Witte also enacted a law in 1897 limiting working hours in enterprises, and in 1898 reformed commercial and industrial taxes. In 1899 the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute was founded on his initiative.

In summer 1898, he addressed a memorandum to the Tsar calling for an agricultural conference on the reform of the peasant community. This resulted in three years of talks about laws to abolish collective responsibility and facilitate the resettlement of farmers onto lands on the outskirts of the empire. Many of his ideas were later adopted by Pyotr Stolypin. In 1902 Witte&#x27;s supporter, Dmitry Sipyagin, the Minister of Home Affairs, was assassinated. In an attempt to keep up the modernization of the Russian economy, Witte called and oversaw the Special Conference on the Needs of the Rural Industry. The conference was to provide recommendations for future reforms and compile the data to justify those reforms. By 1900 the growth in the manufacturing industry had been four times faster than in the preceding five-year period and six times faster than in the decade before that. External trade in industrial goods was equal to that of Belgium. In 1904, the Union of Liberation was formed, which demanded economic and political reform.

====Worsening relations with Japan in 1890s====
Witte controlled East Asian policy in the 1890s. His goal was peaceful expansion of trade with Japan and China. Japan, with its greatly expanded and modernized military, easily defeated the antiquated Chinese forces in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). Russia had to confront collaborating with Japan with which relations had been fairly good for some years or acting as protector of China against Japan. Witte chose the second policy, and in 1894, Russia, Germany and France forced Japan to soften the peace terms that it had imposed on China. Japan was forced to cede the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur back to China (both territories were located in south-western Manchuria, a Chinese province).

The new Russian role angered Tokyo, which decided Russia was the main enemy in its quest to control Manchuria, Korea and China. Witte underestimated Japan&#x27;s growing economic and military power and exaggerated Russia&#x27;s military prowess. Russia concluded an alliance with China (in 1896 by the Li–Lobanov Treaty), which led in 1898 to Russian occupation and administration (by its own personnel and police) of the entire Liaodong Peninsula. Russia also fortified the ice-free Port Arthur and completed the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway, which was to cross northern Manchuria from west to east and link Siberia with Vladivostok. In 1899, the Boxer Rebellion broke out, and the Chinese attacked all foreigners. A large coalition of the major Western powers and Japan sent armed forces to relieve their diplomatic missions in Peking. The Russian government used that as an opportunity to bring a substantial army into Manchuria. As a consequence, by 1900 Manchuria was a fully-incorporated outpost of the Russian Empire, and Japan prepared to fight Russia.

===Loss of power===
Witte, in a memorandum, tried to turn the reports of the zemstvo presidents into a condemnation of the Home Office. In a political conflict on land reform, Vyacheslav von Plehve accused him of being part of a Jewish-Masonic conspiracy. According to Vasily Gurko, Witte had dominated the irresolute tsar, and his opponents decided that was the moment to get rid of him.

Witte was appointed on 16 August 1903 (O.S.) as chairman of the Committee of Ministers, a position he held until October 1905. While officially a promotion, the post had no real power. Witte&#x27;s removal from the influential post of Minister of Finance was engineered under the pressure of the landed gentry and his political enemies within the government and at the court. But historians Nicholas V. Riasanovsky and Robert K. Massie say that Witte&#x27;s opposition to Russian designs on Korea resulted in his resigning from the government in 1903.

===Diplomatic career===
Witte was brought back into the governmental decision-making process to help deal with growing civil unrest. Confronted with increasing opposition and, after consulting with Witte and Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky, the tsar issued a reform &quot;ukase&quot; on December 25, 1904 with vague promises. After the Bloody Sunday riots of 1905, Witte supplied 500 rubles, the equivalent of 250 dollars, to Father Gapon in order for the leader of the demonstration to leave the country. Witte recommended that the government issue a manifesto related to the people&#x27;s demands. Schemes of reform would be elaborated by Ivan Goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstva and municipal councils under the presidency of Witte. On 3 March the tsar condemned the revolutionaries. The government issued a strongly worded prohibition of any further agitation in favor of a constitution. By spring a new political system was beginning to form in Russia. A petition campaign was conducted seeking a wide variety of proposed changes, such as ending the war with Japan, which lasted from February to July 1905. In June mutiny broke out on the Russian battleship Potemkin.

The tsar called upon Witte to negotiate an end to the Russo-Japanese War. He was sent to the United States for the talks, as the Russian emperor&#x27;s plenipotentiary titled &quot;his Secretary of State and President of the Committee of Ministers of the Emperor of Russia,&quot; along with Baron Roman Rosen, Master of the Imperial Court of Russia. The peace talks were held in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

Witte is credited with negotiating brilliantly on Russia&#x27;s behalf during the Treaty of Portsmouth discussions. Russia lost little in the final settlement. But the loss of the war with Japan is believed to have marked the beginning of the end of Imperial Russia. For his efforts, he was made a ().

After that diplomatic success, Witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home. He was dissatisfied with proposals by Alexander Bulygin, the successor of Sviatopolk-Mirsky. Even figures like Mikhail Osipovich Menshikov and Vladimir Meshchersky agreed. A 6 August (O.S.) manifesto created a Duma as a consultative body only. Elections of its representatives would not be direct but be held in four stages, and qualifications for class and property would exclude much of the intelligentsia and all of the working classes from suffrage. The proposal was greeted by numerous protests and strikes across the country, which became known as the Russian Revolution of 1905. 

===1905 Revolution and Chairman of the Council of Ministers===
Witte described the regime&#x27;s usual &quot;incompetence and obstinacy&quot; in response to the crisis of 1904–1905 as a &quot;mixture of cowardice, blindness and stupidity&quot;.

On 8 January 1905, Witte and Sviatopolk-Mirsky had been approached by a delegation of intellectuals led by Maxim Gorky, who begged them to negotiate with demonstrators. After the government&#x27;s postings of warnings of &#x27;resolute measures&#x27; against street gatherings led by Father Gapon, they worried about violent confrontation, which did take place. They were unsuccessful as the government had believed they could control Fr. Gapon. Leaving his visiting cards with Witte and Mirsky, Gorky was arrested, along with the other members of the deputations.

In later 1905 Witte was approached by the tsar&#x27;s advisers, in an effort to save the country from complete collapse, and on 9 October 1905, he went to the Winter Palace for a meeting. Here he told the tsar &#x27;with brutal frankness&#x27; that the country was on the verge of a catastrophic revolution, which he said &#x27;would sweep away a thousand years of history&#x27;. He presented the tsar with two choices: either appoint a military dictator, or agree to broad and major reforms. In a memorandum arguing for a manifesto, Witte outlined the reforms needed to appease the masses.

He argued for the following reforms: creation of a legislative parliament (Imperial Duma) elected via a democratic franchise; granting of civil liberties; establishing a cabinet government and a &#x27;constitutional order&#x27;. Those demands, which basically comprised the political programme of the Liberation Movement, were an attempt to isolate the political Left by pacifying the liberals. Witte emphasised that repression would be only a temporary solution to the problem and a risky one because he believed that the armed forces, whose loyalty was now in question, could collapse if they were to be used against the masses. Most of the military advisers to the tsar agreed with Witte, as did the Governor of Saint Petersburg, Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov, who wielded considerable influence at court. Only when Nicholas II&#x27;s cousin Grand Duke Nicholas threatened to shoot himself if he did not agree to Witte&#x27;s demands, following the tsar&#x27;s request for him to accept appointment as dictator, would the tsar agree. He was embarrassed to have been forced by a former &quot;railway clerk&quot;, a man who was a bureaucrat and &quot;businessman,&quot; to relinquish his autocratic rule. Witte later said that the tsar&#x27;s court were ready to use the Manifesto as a temporary concession, and later return to autocracy &quot;when the revolutionary tide subsided&quot;.

In October Witte was charged with the task of assembling the nation&#x27;s first cabinet government, and he offered the liberals several portfolios: Ministry of Agriculture to Ivan Shipov; Ministry of Trade and Industry to Alexander Guchkov; Ministry of Justice to Anatoly Koni and the Ministry of Education to Evgenii Troubetzkoy. Pavel Milyukov and Prince Georgy Lvov were also offered ministerial posts. None of those liberals agreed to join the government, though. Witte had to form his cabinet from &#x27;tsarist bureaucrats and appointees lacking public confidence&#x27;. The Kadets doubted that Witte could deliver on the promises made by the tsar in October, knowing the tsar&#x27;s staunch opposition to reform.

Witte argued that the Tsarist regime could be saved from a revolution only by the transformation of Russia to a &#x27;modern industrial society&#x27;, in which &#x27;personal and public initiatives&#x27; were encouraged by a rechtsstaat who guaranteed civil liberties.

In the two weeks following the October Manifesto, several pogroms took place against Jews, especially in St. Petersburg and Odessa. Witte ordered an official investigation, where it was revealed that the police in the former city had organised, armed and gave vodka to the anti-Semitic crowds, and even participated in the attacks. Witte demanded the prosecution of the chief of police in St. Petersburg, who was involved in the printing of anti-Semitic pamphlets, but the tsar intervened and protected him. Witte believed that anti-Semitism was &#x27;considered fashionable&#x27; among the elite. In the aftermath of the Kishinev pogrom in 1903, Witte had said that if Jews &#x27;comprise about fifty percent of the membership in the revolutionary parties&#x27;, it was &#x27;the fault of our government. The Jews are too oppressed&#x27;.

Milyukov once confronted Witte to ask why he would not commit himself to a constitution. Witte replied that he could not &#x27;because the Tsar does not wish it&#x27;. Witte was worried that the court was only using him, as had emerged in talks with members of the Kadet Party.

After his skillful diplomacy Witte was appointed as Chairman of the new Council of Ministers, the equivalent of Prime Minister, and formed Sergei Witte&#x27;s Cabinet, not belonging to any party, as there were none. No longer was the tsar the head of the government. &quot;Immediately upon my nomination as President of the Imperial Council I made it clear that the Procurator of the Most Holy Synod Konstantin Pobedonostsev, could not remain in office, for he definitely represented the past.&quot; He was replaced by Prince Alexey D. Obolensky. Trepov and Alexander Bulygin were dismissed and, after many discussions, Pyotr Nikolayevich Durnovo was appointed as Minister of Interior on 1 January 1906; his appointment is considered one of the greatest errors Witte made during his administration.

According to Harold Williams: &quot;That government was almost paralyzed from the beginning. Witte acted immediately by urging the release of political prisoners and the lifting of censorship laws.&quot; Alexander Guchkov and Dmitry Shipov refused to work with the reactionary Durnovo and to support the government. On 26 October (O.S.), the tsar appointed Trepov as Master of the Palace without consulting Witte, and had daily contact with the emperor; his influence at court was paramount. &quot;In addition mass violence broke out in the days following the issuance of the October Manifesto. The major source of the unrest was unrelated to the October Manifesto. It took the form of attacks by gangs in the cities on the Jews. In general, the authorities ignored the attacks.

On 8 November, the sailors in Kronstadt mutinied. The same month, the border provinces were clearly taking advantage of the weakening of Central Russia to show their teeth. Witte later wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; about the empire&#x27;s ethnic minorities: 
 On 10 November, Russian Poland was placed under martial law.

Witte&#x27;s position was not well established. The Liberals remained obdurate and refused to be cajoled. The All-Russian Peasant Union asked the Russian people to refuse to make redemption payments to the government and withdraw their deposits from banks that might be subject to government action. He promised an eight-hour working day and tried to secure vital loans from France to keep the government from bankruptcy.

Witte sent his envoy to the Rothschild bank; they responded that 
&quot;they would willingly render full assistance to the loan, but that they would not be in a position to do so until the Russian Government had enacted legal measures tending to improve the conditions of the Jews in Russia. As I deemed it beneath our dignity to connect the solution of our Jewish question with the loan, I decided to give up my intention of securing the participation of the Rothschilds.&quot;On 24 November by Imperial decree provisional regulations on the censorship of magazines and newspaper was released.

On 16 December Trotsky and the rest of the executive committee of the St. Petersburg Soviet were arrested. The Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Kutler resigned in February 1906; Witte refused to appoint Alexander Krivoshein. In the next few weeks, changes and additions to the Russian Constitution of 1906 were made, so that the emperor was confirmed as the dictator of foreign policies and the supreme commander of the army and navy. The ministers remained responsible solely to Nicholas II, not to the Duma. The &quot;peasant question&quot; or land reforms was a hot issue; the influence of the &quot;Duma of Public Anger&quot; had to be limited, according to Goremykin and Dmitri Trepov. The Bolsheviks boycotted the coming election. When Witte discovered that Nicholas never intended to honour those concessions, he resigned as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The position and influence of General Trepov, Grand Duke Nicholas, the Black Hundreds, and overwhelming victories by the Kadets in the 1906 Russian legislative election, forced Witte on 14th to resign, which was announced 22 April 1906 (O.S.).

Witte confessed to Alexander Polovtsov in April 1906 that the success of the repressions in the wake of the Moscow uprising in 1905 had resulted in his losing all influence over the tsar. Despite Witte&#x27;s protests, Durnovo was allowed to &#x27;carry out a brutal and excessive, and often totally unjustified, series of repressive measures.&#x27;

In 1906, Father Gapon returned to Russia from exile and supported Witte&#x27;s government. On 30 April 1905 Witte proposed the Law of Religious Toleration, followed by the edict of 30 October 1906 giving legal status to schismatics and sectarians of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), the established state church. Witte argued that ending discrimination against religious rivals of the Orthodox Church &#x27;would not harm the church, provided it embraced the reforms that would revive its religious life&#x27;. Although the Church&#x27;s &#x27;senior hierarchs&#x27; may for some time have played with the thought of self-government, Witte&#x27;s demand that it would come at the cost of religious toleration &#x27;guaranteed to drive them back into the arms of reaction&#x27;. Witte had made that demand (self-government in exchange for religious toleration) in the hope of &#x27;wooing&#x27; the important commercial groups of the ethnic minorities of Jewish and Old Believer communities.

===Member of the State Council===

According to Dmitry Filosofov, Witte was the only talented person in the government, but he brought many troubles to Russia. He destroyed the autocracy not from the outside like revolutionaries but from the inside. Witte failed to retain the confidence of the emperor but continued in Russian politics as a member of the State Council but he was never again appointed to an administrative role in the government. He was ostracized by the Russian establishment. In January 1907 a bomb was found planted in his home. The investigator Pavel Alexandrovich Alexandrov proved that the Okhrana, the tsarist secret police, had been involved. During the winter season, Witte lived in Biarritz and started writing his &quot;Memoirs,&quot; but he returned to St Petersburg in 1908.

During the July Crisis in 1914, Grigori Rasputin, and Witte desperately urged the Tsar to avoid the conflict and warned that Europe faced calamity if Russia became involved. The advice went unheeded. French Ambassador Maurice Paléologue complained to Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov.

===Death===

Witte died in February 1915 at his home in St. Petersburg; his quick death was attributed to meningitis or a brain tumor. His third-class funeral was held at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. On the black granite slab, in addition to the usual dates of birth and death, another date was carved: 17 October, 1905, the date he presented the Manifesto. Witte had no children, but he had adopted his wife&#x27;s by her first marriage. According to Edvard Radzinsky, Witte asked in vain for the title of Count to be given to his grandson, L. K. Naryshkin (1905-1963).

Witte&#x27;s reputation was burnished in the West after his secret memoirs were published in translation in 1921. They had been completed in 1912 and kept in a bank in Bayonne, France. He had left orders that they could not be published during the lifetimes of him and his contemporaries. The ambassador in France, Vasily Maklakov, received them from his widow. The original manuscript of his memoirs are now held in Columbia University Library&#x27;s Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European History and Culture.

<text>Nicholas Brendon Schultz (born April 12, 1971), known professionally as Nicholas Brendon, is an American actor and writer. He is best known for playing Xander Harris in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003) and Kevin Lynch in &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (2007–2014).

Brendon played Xander Harris for seven years and appeared in all but one of 144 episodes. For his role as Xander, Brendon was nominated for a Saturn Award in 1998 and 1999 for Best Genre TV Actor and in 2000 for Best Supporting Actor. He continues to regularly attend comic conventions and sci-fi conventions. He has been involved in development of Xander&#x27;s character in follow-up comic books, and has been credited as a writer for several issues.

Although Brendon has continued to work as an actor, with regular recurring parts in TV series and starring roles in limited release films such as &quot;Coherence&quot; and &quot;Big Gay Love&quot;, his struggles with substance misuse and depression have overshadowed his professional career. Brendon has attracted public attention for his multiple arrests and convictions on a variety of charges since 2010.

== Early life ==
Nicholas Brendon was born Nicholas Brendon Schultz on April 12, 1971, in Los Angeles, three minutes after his identical twin brother, Kelly Donovan. He was born the second of four boys, with two younger brothers.

As a child, he aspired to become a professional baseball player, but he &quot;lost the passion for it&quot; at 20. Instead, he decided to pursue acting to help manage his stutter, which had first become apparent at age seven or eight, and had made him so fearful of speaking or interacting with strangers that he did not begin dating until 21 or 22. Brendon comments, &quot;Every day I still have to remind myself to slow down and concentrate. Constant repetition of tongue-twisters was like lifting weights for me, but patience and persistence have paid off.&quot; Brendon has done work for the Stuttering Foundation of America, which approached him around 2001, and made him its honorary chairperson for its National Stuttering Awareness Week in May 2001.

He gave up acting after two years because he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand the politics in Hollywood&quot;. Brendon returned to school to study medicine, which didn&#x27;t work out; he also tried his hand at a variety of odd jobs, including plumber&#x27;s assistant, veterinary janitor, day care counselor, waiter, and production assistant for the television show &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot;.

== Career ==

===Breakout role as Xander Harris===

At the age of 25, Brendon had hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;: his girlfriend had left him, he was working as a waiter and could barely afford his rent, and had almost given up on getting good work. After buying the wrong kind of Pop Tarts for his co-workers, his boss fired him and told him &quot;You should be acting.&quot; Brendon was attracted to the pilot script for &quot;Buffy&quot; because of how much he had hated high school. Brendon recognised that Xander was based on Joss Whedon when he had attended high school, accounting for why Xander &quot;gets all the good lines&quot;. He signed with a manager and was cast as Xander Harris on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; three months later.

Brendon shared the screen with his twin, Kelly Donovan, when his character was split in two in the fifth-season episode &quot;The Replacement&quot;.

For his role as Xander, Brendon was nominated for Saturn Award in 1998 and 1999 for Best Genre TV Actor and in 2000 for the Supporting Actor.

In 2014, Brendon was part of a summit for writers of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; comics, which included Joss Whedon, Jane Espenson, Drew Greenberg, Andrew Chambliss and the then-incoming &quot;Buffy&quot; writer Christos Gage. He was involved with the show&#x27;s canonical comic book series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten,&quot; on stories centering on his character.

Brendon continues to be a regular fixture at comic conventions and sci-fi fan conventions, and has streamed videos of himself reading fanfiction starring his character Xander Harris on his Facebook page.

===After &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;===

After the series ended in 2003, Brendon joined the cast of the Fox television pilot &quot;The Pool at Maddy Breakers&quot;. The series was not picked up by the network. In 2004, he co-starred in his first ABC Family movie, &quot;Celeste in the City.&quot; The following year, he returned to Fox as part of the cast of &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, based on the book by chef Anthony Bourdain. Thirteen episodes were made, but the series was canceled on December 9 of the same year after the fourth episode aired, due to low ratings.

In 2006, he voiced Huntsboy #89 for season 2 of the animated series &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;. That same year, he reunited with his former &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; co-star Charisma Carpenter in the ABC Family TV movie &quot;Relative Chaos&quot;.

From July 26 through August 30, 2006, Brendon co-starred with Noah Wyle in the play &quot;Lobster Alice&quot; at the Blank Theatre Company in Los Angeles. He subsequently appeared in the Blank Theatre&#x27;s annual Young Playwrights Festival and its productions of &quot;The SantaLand Diaries&quot; (November 20 to December 20, 2009), and &quot;Why Torture Is Wrong, and the People Who Love Them&quot;.

In 2007, Brendon began appearing on the TV series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; in the recurring role of FBI technical analyst Kevin Lynch. He appeared in episodes in each subsequent season through the tenth season.

In late 2010, he premiered his web comic &quot;Very Bad Koalas&quot;, co-created with animation director/producer Steve Loter. The comic follows the journey of two sheltered and innocent koalas experiencing a variety of people and places while on the run from the law in a 1958 Cadillac El Dorado.

Also in 2010, Brendon began a four-episode arc on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Private Practice&quot; playing Lee McHenry, a mentally disturbed man who assaults Charlotte King.

Brendon had a recurring role in &quot;Untitled Web Series About a Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time&quot; along with Sylvester McCoy, Robert Picardo, Mayim Bialik, Chase Masterson, Rosearik Rikki Simons, Carrie Keranen.

== Personal life ==

Brendon was married to actress Tressa DiFiglia from 2001 to 2006.

He enjoys painting and photography and has sold his own original artwork. Brendon started to tour gallery shows of his artwork in 2019. He released a &quot;Fall Art Collection&quot; in 2020.

Brendon has struggled for many years with depression and alcoholism, leading to many run-ins with the law and multiple arrests and several convictions for destruction of property, vandalism, theft and domestic violence. At a &quot;Buffy&quot; fan convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2004, he announced that he had voluntarily entered rehab for alcoholism.

Brendon married Moonda Tee in Las Vegas in 2014, one week after proposing. Brendon announced their separation via social media five months later in February 2015. Tee claimed in a video posted to social media that this was because Brendon had cheated on her.

===Legal issues===

In March 2010, Brendon was tased and arrested by Los Angeles police, who confronted him in response to a call about an intoxicated individual. He allegedly swung his fists at the officers and attempted to run away, and was arrested for felony vandalism. Brendon was later charged with four misdemeanors, including one count of resisting arrest, two counts of battery against a police officer, and one count of vandalism. In May 2010, he again checked himself into rehab to address his addiction to alcohol and sleeping pills. Brendon pleaded no contest to all four charges in June 2010 and received a one-year suspended jail sentence, was placed on probation for 36 months, and was required to perform 10 days of community service.

While participating in the Tree City Comic Con, Brendon was arrested on October 17, 2014, in a Boise, Idaho, hotel lobby for misdemeanor charges of malicious injury to property and resisting or obstructing officers. Brendon subsequently made a public apology and stated that the incident was &quot;embarrassing&quot; and the result of drinking alcohol while taking pain medication for a knee problem.

Brendon was arrested on suspicion of grand theft by Fort Lauderdale police in February 2015 after he reportedly trashed his hotel room and refused to pay the bill. He had been in Fort Lauderdale for a local comic convention. His spokesman released a statement shortly after the incident: &quot;Nicholas is, unfortunately, battling a disease that many of us don&#x27;t understand. ... he&#x27;s sorry for his actions. ... we are aware that Nicholas&#x27; actions are of a much deeper origin—and we are working toward creating a healthy environment for him to thrive in. The past several months have been trying, and Nicholas&#x27; disease is damaging and consistently misunderstood. We are doing everything in our power at camp Nick to assure his recovery.&quot; Brendon was arrested again in March of 2015 for destroying another hotel room after demanding an upgrade. In an interview the next day, he blamed his behaviour on a recent change in medication and said he would see a doctor to have it reviewed. Due to his arrest, Brendon missed the first day of the ALT*Con conference, apologizing to fans.

Brendon appeared, in August 2015, on &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; to discuss his recent arrests and alcoholism. However, he walked off the show soon after the interview began. Brendon later explained on his Facebook page that he had been drinking before the interview and had felt unprepared to &quot;lay [out] the darkest parts of myself on national TV&quot;. Brendon returned to &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; in December that year to discuss his arrests and mental health struggles, including several suicide attempts.

Brendon was arrested in Saratoga Springs, New York, in October 2015 for strangling his girlfriend in a hotel room. He was charged with felony third-degree robbery, criminal mischief and obstruction of breathing. He pleaded guilty to criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. As part of his plea deal, Brendon avoided a custodial sentence if he completed drug and alcohol counselling and one year of probation. Brendon subsequently entered a rehab facility in California for a 90-day residential treatment program.

Brendon was arrested for assaulting another girlfriend at a hotel bar in Palm Springs, California, in October 2017. He was charged with felony corporal injury to a spouse in April 2019, and pled not guilty a month later. Brendon subsequently agreed to a plea deal to avoid a potential four-year prison sentence for felony domestic violence, and violation of active protective orders issued by two states. The orders allowed Brendon to be near the woman, but prohibited him from harassing, threatening, injuring or assaulting her. On February 28, 2020, he was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and 20 hours of community service, and required him to complete a 52-week domestic violence course.

Brendon was arrested in Terre Haute, Indiana in August 2021 for failure to identify and obtaining a prescription by fraud. He was pulled over while driving erratically and police found bags with crystal residue powder in them. A search by police dogs found secret compartments cut out of the floor of the car and more bags with residue powder. This arrest was a violation of his probation for domestic assault. A plea agreement was reached, but the details were not released.

===Health issues===

Brendon, who suffers from cauda equina syndrome, underwent spinal surgery after a fall in February 2021. Several days later, during a Facebook Live stream from his hospital room, Brendon addressed the allegation that his former co-star Charisma Carpenter made against Joss Whedon, stating that “I love and support [her] very much and I know that story, and it’s not a kind story,” further stating that although he “love[s] both Carpenter and Whedon,&quot; he acknowledged that his relationship with Whedon had not been entirely friendly, ultimately saying that it was &quot;kinda hard to give a statement&quot; given his relationship with the people involved.

Following his August 2021 arrest, Brendon suffered from paralysis in his genitals and legs. Two months later, he underwent another spinal surgery, during which his spinal cord was punctured, resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid leak. In 2022, Brendon suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect.

In 2010, Caulfield posted the original &quot;Bandwagon&quot; to YouTube along with a 12-part webseries sequel set several years later.

Caulfield is also the co-author of the webcomic &quot;Contropussy&quot;, which has been published by IDW Publishing.

Caulfield starred in the independent feature film &quot;TiMER&quot;, released May 2009. She starred as the lead role in the FunnyOrDie short film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic, It&#x27;s Organic&quot;. In 2012, she received critical acclaim for her guest appearance on the ABC fantasy series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, as the Blind Witch from the fairytale Hansel and Gretel. She guest starred in the second season of the Jane Espenson scripted romantic comedy web series, &quot;Husbands&quot;.

==Personal life==
Caulfield was married to Cornelius Grobbelaar from 2006 to 2010.

In 2016, Caulfield confirmed that she was expecting a child with Mark Leslie Ford. She gave birth to a daughter later that year. She and Ford married in November 2017.

<text>The second USS &quot;Charleston&quot; (C-2) was a United States Navy protected cruiser — the fourth US protected cruiser to be built. Lacking experience in building steel cruisers, the design was purchased from the British company Armstrong, Mitchell and Co. of Newcastle, the construction to be by an American shipyard. In design, she succeeded the &quot;ABC&quot; cruisers , , and with better protection, higher speed, and similar armament.

She was launched on 19 July 1888 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, sponsored by Mrs. A. S. Smith, and commissioned on 26 December 1889, Captain George C. Remey in command.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Charleston&quot; was built with plans purchased from Armstrong, a British manufacturer, which were similar to the Armstrong-built and launched in 1885. was also built to Armstrong plans. Building &quot;Charleston&quot;″s propulsion machinery proved troublesome; apparently it was a combination of components of several different plants. Union Iron Works had to make costly changes in order to build the ship.

&quot;Charleston&quot; was armed with two /35 caliber Mark 3 guns, one each in bow and stern barbettes, and six /30 caliber Mark 3 guns in sponsons along the sides. The 8-inch guns were initially unavailable, so from her commissioning in 1889 until a refit in 1891 they were replaced by four additional 6-inch guns. Secondary armament was four 6-pounder () guns, two 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, two 1-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and two .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns. Four torpedo tubes were included in the design but never mounted.

&quot;Charleston&quot; had gun shields, barbettes, and a conning tower. The complete armored deck was up to on its sloped sides and in the middle.

The engineering plant included six coal-fired cylindrical boilers producing steam for two horizontal compound engines totaling for a speed of on trials. &quot;Charleston&quot; was the last US Navy ship with the older compound engine design; later ships had more powerful and efficient triple expansion engines. Unlike some contemporary designs, no sails were fitted. &quot;Charleston&quot; carried 328 tons of coal for a range of at ; this could be increased to 682 tons for .

==Service history==

===Pacific, 1890–96===
&quot;Charleston&quot; cleared Mare Island Navy Yard on 10 April 1890 to join the Pacific Squadron as flagship, cruising in the eastern Pacific. She carried the remains of King David Kalakaua of Hawaii to Honolulu after his death in San Francisco, and between 8 May and 4 June 1891, took part in the search for the Chilean steamer &quot;Itata&quot; which had fled San Diego in violation of the American neutrality laws, enforced strictly during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Between 19 August and 31 December 1891, &quot;Charleston&quot; cruised in the Far East as flagship of the Asiatic Squadron, rejoining the Pacific Squadron in 1892 until 7 October, when she departed for the east coast, calling at a number of South American ports en route.

&quot;Charleston&quot; arrived in Hampton Roads on 23 February 1893. From here she sailed with other American and foreign ships to the International Naval Review conducted at New York City on 26 April 1893 as part of the Columbian Exposition. Taking the review was President Grover Cleveland in despatch vessel USS &quot;Dolphin&quot;. In the fall of 1893, &quot;Charleston&quot; turned south to join the strong force patrolling the east coast of South America to protect American interests and shipping from disturbance during the Brazilian Revolution. After a leisurely cruise from Montevideo, Uruguay, she arrived in San Francisco on 8 July 1894 to prepare for a return to the Asiatic Station. She cruised in the Far East until 6 June 1896, when she steamed from Yokohama for San Francisco where she was placed out of commission on 27 July 1896.

===Spanish–American War, 1898–99===
Upon the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, &quot;Charleston&quot; was quickly made ready for service, and was recommissioned on 5 May 1898, Captain Henry Glass, Commanding. Sixteen days later, she sailed for Honolulu, where she was joined by three chartered steamers transporting troops, including &quot;City of Peking&quot;.

&quot;Charleston&quot; was sent to raise the American flag over Guam, then a Spanish possession. At daybreak on 20 June, the little convoy arrived off the north end of Guam. &quot;Charleston&quot; investigated the harbor at Agana, then proceeded to Apra Harbor. Leaving the transports safely anchored outside, &quot;Charleston&quot; sailed boldly into the harbor, firing a challenge at Fort Santa Cruz. Almost at once, a boatload of Spanish authorities came out to apologize for having no gunpowder with which to return the presumed salute. They were astounded to learn that a state of war existed, and that the American ships had come to take the island. The next day the surrender was received by a landing party sent ashore from &quot;Charleston&quot;. With the Spanish governor and the island&#x27;s garrison of 69 as prisoners in one of the transports, &quot;Charleston&quot; then sailed to join Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s fleet in Manila Bay.

She arrived Manila on 30 June 1898 to reinforce the victors of the previous month&#x27;s great naval battle in their close blockade of the Bay. &quot;Charleston&quot; joined in the final bombardment of 13 August, which brought about the surrender of the city of Manila. She remained in the Philippines through 1898 and 1899, bombarding insurgent positions to aid Army forces advancing ashore, and taking part in the naval expedition that captured Subic Bay in September 1899.

===Loss by wrecking, November 1899===
&quot;Charleston&quot; grounded on Guinápac Rocks (), about 10 miles East by South of Camiguin Island north of Luzon at 5:30am on 2 November 1899. Wrecked beyond salvage, she was abandoned by all her crew, who made camp on a nearby island, later moving on to Camiguin while the ship&#x27;s sailing launch was sent for help. On 12 November, gunboat arrived to rescue the shipwrecked men. &quot;Charleston&quot; was the first steel-hulled ship lost by the US Navy.

<doc id="213739" wikidata="Q811177" url="?curid=213739" title="Dry dock">
<text>A dry dock (sometimes drydock or dry-dock) is a narrow basin or vessel that can be flooded to allow a load to be floated in, then drained to allow that load to come to rest on a dry platform. Dry docks are used for the construction, maintenance, and repair of ships, boats, and other watercraft.

==History==

===China===
The use of dry docks in China goes at least as far back as the 10th century A.D. In 1088, Song dynasty scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) wrote in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;:

===Europe===
====Greco-Roman world====
The Greek author Athenaeus of Naucratis (V 204c-d) reports something that may have been a dry dock in Ptolemaic Egypt in the reign of Ptolemy IV Philopator (221-204 BC) on the occasion of the launch of the enormous &quot;Tessarakonteres&quot; rowing ship. However a more recent survey by Goodchild and Forbes does not substantiate its existence.

It has been calculated that a dock for a vessel of such a size might have had a volume of 750,000 gallons of water.

====Renaissance Europe====
Before the 15th century, when the hull below the waterline needed attention, careening was practised: at high tide the vessel was floated over a beach of hard sand and allowed to rest on one side when the tide receded. An account of 1434 described how a site near Southampton with a bottom of soft mud was selected for the warship &quot;Grace Dieu&quot;, so that the hull would bed itself in and remain upright at low tide. A timber, brushwood and clay wall was then built up around the hull. The first early modern purpose-built European and oldest surviving dry dock still in use was commissioned by Henry VII of England at HMNB Portsmouth in 1495. This was a timber-lined excavation, with the seaward end closed off by a temporary revetted bank of rock and clay that had to be dug away by hand (an operation taking typically 29 days, working night and day to accord with the tides) to allow the passage of a ship. Emptying was by a pump, possibly in the form of a bucket-chain powered by horses. This dry dock currently holds First World War monitor HMS M33.

Possibly the earliest description of a floating dock comes from a small Italian book printed in Venice in 1560, called &quot;Descrittione dell&#x27;artifitiosa machina&quot;. In the booklet, an unknown author asks for the privilege of using a new method for the salvaging of a grounded ship and then proceeds to describe and illustrate his approach. The included woodcut shows a ship flanked by two large floating trestles, forming a roof above the vessel. The ship is pulled in an upright position by a number of ropes attached to the superstructure.

===Modern era===
The Saint-Nazaire&#x27;s Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique owns one of the biggest in the world: . The Alfredo da Silva Dry Dock in Almada, Portugal, was closed in 2000. The largest roofed dry dock is at the German Meyer Werft Shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, it is 504 m long, 125 m wide and stands 75 m tall.

Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is the site of a large dry dock . The massive cranes are named after the Biblical figures Samson and Goliath.

Dry Dock 12 at Newport News Shipbuilding at is the largest dry dock in the United States. The largest floating-dock in North America is named The Vigorous. It is operated by Vigor Industries in Portland, OR, in the Swan Island industrial area along the Willamette River.

==Types==
===Graving===
A is the traditional form of dry dock. It is a narrow basin, usually made of earthen berms and concrete, closed by gates or a caisson. A vessel is floated in with the gates open, then the gates are closed and the water is pumped out, leaving the craft supported on blocks.

The keel blocks as well as the bilge block are placed on the floor of the dock in accordance with the &quot;docking plan&quot; of the ship. Routine use of dry docks is for the &quot;graving&quot; i.e. the cleaning, removal of barnacles and rust, and re-painting of ships&#x27; hulls.

Some fine-tuning of the ship&#x27;s position can be done by divers while there is still some water left to manoeuvre the vessel. It is extremely important that supporting blocks conform to the structural members so that the ship is not damaged when its weight is supported by the blocks. Some anti-submarine warfare warships have sonar domes protruding beneath the hull, requiring the hull to be supported several metres above the bottom of the dry dock, or depressions built into the floor of the dock, to accommodate the protrusions.

Once the remainder of the water is pumped out, the ship can be freely inspected or serviced. When work on the ship is finished, the gates are opened to allow water in, and the ship is carefully refloated.
Modern graving docks are box-shaped, to accommodate newer, boxier ships, whereas old dry docks are often shaped like the ships expected to dock there. This shaping was advantageous because such a dock was easier to build, it was easier to side-support the ships, and less water had to be pumped away.

Dry docks used for building naval vessels may occasionally be built with a roof, to prevent spy satellites from taking pictures of the dry dock and any vessels that may be in it. During World War II, the German used fortified dry docks to protect its submarines from Allied air raids (see submarine pen).

An advantage of covered dry docks is that work can take place in any weather; this is frequently used by modern shipyards for construction especially of complex, high-value vessels like cruise ships, where delays would incur a high cost.

===Floating===
A floating dry dock is a type of pontoon for dry docking ships, possessing floodable buoyancy chambers and a U-shaped cross-section. The walls are used to give the dry dock stability when the floor or deck is below the surface of the water. When valves are opened, the chambers fill with water, causing the dry dock to float lower in the water. The deck becomes submerged and this allows a ship to be moved into position inside. When the water is pumped out of the chambers, the dry dock rises and the ship is lifted out of the water on the rising deck, allowing work to proceed on the ship&#x27;s hull.

A large floating dry dock involves multiple rectangular sections. These sections can be combined to handle ships of various lengths, and the sections themselves can come in different dimensions. Each section contains its own equipment for emptying the ballast and to provide the required services, and the addition of a bow section can facilitate the towing of the dry dock once assembled. For smaller boats, one-piece floating dry docks can be constructed or converted out of an existing obsolete barge, potentially coming with their own bow and steering mechanism.

Shipyards operate floating dry docks as one method for hauling or docking vessels. Floating drydocks are important in locations where porous ground prevents the use of conventional drydocks, such as at the Royal Naval Dockyard on the limestone archipelago of Bermuda. Another advantage of floating dry docks is that they can be moved to wherever they are needed and can also be sold second-hand. During World War II, the U.S. Navy used such auxiliary floating drydocks extensively to provide maintenance in remote locations. Two examples of these were the 1,000-foot AFDB-1 and the 850-foot AFDB-3. The latter, an Advance Base Sectional Dock which saw action in Guam, was mothballed near Norfolk, Virginia, and was eventually towed to Portland, Maine, to become part of Bath Iron Works&#x27; repair facilities.

A downside of floating dry docks is that unscheduled sinkings and off-design dives may take place, as with the Russian dock &quot;PD-50&quot; in 2018.

The &quot;Hughes Mining Barge&quot;, or HMB-1, is a covered, floating drydock that is also submersible to support the secret transfer of a mechanical lifting device underneath the &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot; ship, as well as the development of the &quot;Sea Shadow&quot; stealth ship.

The Great Balance Dock, built in New York City in 1854, was the largest floating drydock in the world when it was launched. It was long and could lift 8,000 tons, accommodating the largest ships of its day.

===Alternative dry dock systems===
Apart from graving docks and floating dry docks, ships can also be dry docked and launched by:
*Marine railway — For repair of larger ships up to about 3000 tons ship weight
*Shiplift — For repair as well as for new-building. From 800 to 25000 ton ship-weight
*Slipway, patent slip — For repair of smaller boats and the new-building launch of larger vessels

==Other uses==
Some dry docks are used during the construction of bridges, dams, and other large objects. For example, the dry dock on the artificial island of Neeltje-Jans was used for the construction of the Oosterscheldekering, a large dam in the Netherlands that consists of 65 concrete pillars weighing 18,000 tonnes each. The pillars were constructed in a drydock and towed to their final place on the seabed.

A dry dock may also be used for the prefabrication of the elements of an immersed tube tunnel, before they are floated into position, as was done with Boston&#x27;s Silver Line.

<doc id="213740" wikidata="Q1771651" url="?curid=213740" title="Dasht-i-Leili massacre">
<text>The Dasht-i-Leili massacre occurred in December 2001 during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan when 250 to 2,000 Taliban prisoners were shot and/or suffocated to death in metal shipping containers while being transferred by Junbish-i Milli soldiers under the supervision of forces loyal to General Rashid Dostum from Kunduz to Sheberghan prison in Afghanistan. The site of the graves is believed to be in the Dasht-e Leili desert just west of Sheberghan, in the Jowzjan Province.

Some of the prisoners were survivors of the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in Mazar-i-Sharif. In 2009, Dostum denied the accusations. According to all sources, many of the prisoners died from suffocation inside the containers, and some witnesses claimed that those who survived were shot. The dead were buried in a mass grave under the authority of Commander Kamal.

The allegations have been investigated since 2002 by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR). PHR conducted two forensic missions to the site under the auspices of the United Nations in 2002. In 2008, PHR reported that the grave had been tampered with.

==Controversy over responsibility and scale==
In late 2001, around 8,000 Taliban fighters, including Chechens, Uzbeks and Arabs as well as suspected members of al-Qaeda, surrendered to the Junbish-i Milli faction of Northern Alliance General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a U.S. ally in the war in Afghanistan, after the siege of Kunduz. Several hundred of the prisoners, among them American John Walker Lindh, came to be held in Qala-i-Jangi, a fort near Mazar-i-Sharif, where they staged a bloody uprising which took several days to quell. The remaining 7,500 were loaded onto containers for transport to Sheberghan prison, a journey that in some cases took several days. Human rights advocates say hundreds or thousands of them went missing.

In late 2001, Carlotta Gall, Jamie Doran and &quot;Newsweek&quot; began reporting rumors that Dostum&#x27;s forces, who were fighting the Taliban alongside the US Special Forces, intentionally suffocated as many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners in container trucks in an incident that has become known as the Dasht-i-Leili massacre.

The first allegations that dozens of prisoners had suffocated in the containers appeared in a December 2001 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A 2002 documentary named &quot;Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death&quot; by Jamie Doran produced testimony from eyewitnesses alleging hundreds or even thousands of prisoners had died, either during transport in the containers or being shot and dumped in the Dasht-i-Leili desert after arriving at the hopelessly overcrowded Sheberghan prison. Witnesses presented in the documentary also alleged that wounded and unconscious survivors of the container transports had been executed in the desert in the presence of U.S. soldiers. Doran&#x27;s documentary, which was viewed by the European and German parliaments, caused widespread concern in Europe and among human rights advocates. It was not reported on in the United States mass media.

Allegations of American involvement were disputed by Robert Young Pelton, who had been in the area reporting for National Geographic and CNN. Pelton also said the number of prisoners who suffocated in the containers was roughly 250, a far smaller number than alleged in Doran&#x27;s documentary. He claims he saw US medics treating some of the prisoners. He says some of the bodies may be victims of the Taliban or of Malik&#x27;s executions in the 1990s.

In 2016, Dostum spoke to Ronan Farrow, reluctantly admitting that local commanders had loaded prisoners from the uprising at Qala-i-Jangi into multiple containers and that American forces had been present. Dostum denied that either he or the Americans murdered the prisoners and would not directly say whether he had ordered the commanders to do this nor whether witnesses were later killed.

==Subsequent investigations==

In 2002, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) led an investigation of alleged mass gravesites at Mazar. A UN forensic team found fifteen recently deceased bodies in a six-yard trial trench dug at a grave site and performed an autopsy on three of them, concluding that they had been the victims of homicide, the cause of death being consistent with suffocation, as described by the eyewitness reports featured in Doran&#x27;s film. A major &quot;Newsweek&quot; article on the massacre appeared in August 2002, raising questions about America&#x27;s responsibility for the war crimes committed by its allies. It quoted Aziz ur Rahman Razekh, director of the Afghan Organization of Human Rights, asserting &quot;with confidence&quot; that &quot;more than a thousand people died in the containers.&quot;

The 2002 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article stated that &quot;death by container&quot; – locking prisoners in containers and leaving them to die in them – had been an established method of mass execution in Afghanistan for some years. As the containers were sealed, the prisoners began suffering from lack of air soon after being locked in them. According to witnesses in Doran&#x27;s documentary, air holes were shot into the sides of some containers, killing several of those inside. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that drivers were punished for giving water to the prisoners, or punching holes into the containers. Survivors of the container transports, interviewed by &quot;Newsweek&quot;, recalled that after 24 hours the bound prisoners were so thirsty that they resorted to licking the sweat of each other&#x27;s bodies. Some bit into the bodies of fellow prisoners. In the containers of these survivors, only 20 to 40 prisoners of an original 150 or more were still alive when the containers arrived at their destination.

Further investigation of the mass grave sites were impeded by Rashid Dostum&#x27;s continuing military control over the area and due to intimidation. Physicians for Human Rights have claimed that the Bush administration consistently refused to respond to PHR&#x27;s calls for investigation. In 2008, the United States Defense Department and State Department released documentation per a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Raymond that indicated that 1,500 to 2,000 people were killed at Dasht-i-Leili.

Ahmed Rashid wrote in 2008 that the prisoners were &quot;stuffed in like sardines, 250 or more per container, so that the prisoners&#x27; knees were against their chests&quot;. According to Rashid, only a handful survived in each of the thirty containers and UN officials reported that just six out of an original 220 survived in one of the containers. The dead were buried by bulldozers in pits in the desert. Rashid called the massacre &quot;the most outrageous and brutal human rights violation of the entire war&quot;, which had occurred &quot;despite the presence of US SOF in the region.&quot;

==American probe==
On 10 July 2009, an article on the massacre by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist James Risen appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Risen stated that human rights groups&#x27; estimates of the total number of victims &quot;ranged from several hundred to several thousand&quot; and that U.S. officials had &quot;repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the episode&quot;. Questioned about the article by Anderson Cooper of CNN during a trip to Africa, United States President Barack Obama was reported to have &quot;ordered national security officials to look into allegations that the Bush administration resisted efforts to investigate a CIA-backed Afghan warlord over the killings of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in 2001.&quot;

Excerpts from Doran&#x27;s documentary &quot;Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death&quot; were broadcast on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; on 13 July 2009, with images from the documentary shown on the programme&#x27;s website. The programme, which featured James Risen and Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, claimed that &quot;at least 2,000&quot; prisoners of war had perished in the massacre. Sirkin confirmed the claims made in &quot;Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death&quot; that eyewitnesses who had come forward with information on the incident had been tortured and killed, and stated that a FOIA document showed that the &quot;U.S. government and, apparently, intelligence agency – it&#x27;s a three-letter word that’s redacted of an intelligence branch of the U.S. government in the FOIA – they knew and reported that eyewitnesses to this massacre had been killed and tortured.&quot;

Risen commented in the programme that in writing his article he &quot;tried not to get caught up in something that I think in the past has slowed down some of the efforts by journalists to look into this. I think in the past one of the mistakes some journalists made was to try and prove a direct involvement by the U.S. personnel in the massacre itself. I frankly don&#x27;t believe that any U.S. military personnel were involved in the massacre. And, you know, U.S. Special Forces troops who were traveling with Dostum have long maintained that they knew nothing about this. And, you know, so I tried not to go down that road.&quot; He added that &quot;the investigation should focus rather on what happened afterwards in the Bush administration.&quot;

A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial on 14 July 2009 called the Bush administration&#x27;s refusal to investigate a &quot;sordid legacy&quot;. Noting that Dostum was &quot;on the C.I.A. payroll and his militia worked closely with United States Special Forces in the early days of the war&quot;, the editorial asked President Obama to &quot;order a full investigation into the massacre. The site must be guarded and witnesses protected.&quot; Edward S. Herman, writing in &quot;Z Magazine&quot;, commented that this renewed interest by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the massacre, after a 7-year silence on the matter, was rather late in coming and coincided with Dostum&#x27;s restoration to a position of power in Afghanistan prior to the August 2009 elections, in a move that the U.S. administration disapproved of. Herman said that &quot;The New York Times&quot; had essentially looked whichever way the current U.S. administration had wanted it to look for the best part of a decade, and that this was also &quot;part of the sordid legacy of the &quot;New York Times&quot;.&quot;

On 17 July 2009, in an article published by &quot;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&quot;, Dostum, recently reappointed to his government job by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, again described Doran&#x27;s film as a &quot;fake story&quot;, saying that the whole number of prisoners of war captured by his troops was less than the number Doran&#x27;s film claimed had been killed, and denying there could have been any abuse of prisoners. Dostum&#x27;s column was sharply criticised by human rights groups. In a rebuttal published by &quot;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&quot; in parallel to Dostum&#x27;s piece, Sam Zarifi, the Asia-Pacific director for Amnesty International and a human rights investigator in Afghanistan in 2002, stated that &quot;investigations carried out shortly after the alleged killings by highly experienced and respected forensic analysts from Physicians for Human Rights established the presence of recently deceased human remains at Dasht-e Leili and suggested that they were the victims of homicide.&quot;

In December 2009 Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) renewed its call for the Obama administration&#x27;s Department of Justice to investigate why the Bush administration impeded an FBI criminal probe in the wake of the 10 July 2009 front-page article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. On 26 December 2009, the Asian Tribune published the full transcript of a video interview given by the officials of Physicians for Human Rights, detailing nearly eight years of advocacy and investigation.

<text>Docudrama (or documentary drama) is a genre of television and film, which features dramatized re-enactments of actual events. It is described as a hybrid of documentary and drama and &quot;a fact-based representation of real event&quot;.

Docudramas typically strive to adhere to known historical facts, while allowing some degree of dramatic license in peripheral details, such as when there are gaps in the historical record. Dialogue may, or may not, include the actual words of real-life people, as recorded in historical documents. Docudrama producers sometimes choose to film their reconstructed events in the actual locations in which the historical events occurred.

A docudrama, in which historical fidelity is the keynote, is generally distinguished from a film merely &quot;based on true events&quot;, a term which implies a greater degree of dramatic license, and from the concepts of historical drama, a broader category which may also incorporate entirely fictionalized events intermixed with factual ones, and historical fiction, stories generally featuring fictional characters and plots taking place in historical settings or against the backdrop of historical events.

As a portmanteau, &quot;docudrama&quot; is sometimes confused with &quot;docufiction&quot;. However, unlike docufiction—which is essentially a documentary filmed in real time, incorporating some fictional elements—docudrama is filmed at a time subsequent to the events portrayed.

== Characteristics ==
The docudrama genre is a reenactment of actual historical events. However it makes no promise of being entirely accurate in its interpretation. It blends fact and fiction for its recreation and its quality depends on factors like budget and production time. The filmmaker Leslie Woodhead presents the docudrama dilemma in the following manner:

Docudramas producers use literary and narrative techniques to flesh out the bare facts of an event in history to tell a story. Some degree of license is often taken with minor historical facts for the sake of enhancing the drama. Docudramas are distinct from historical fiction, in which the historical setting is a mere backdrop for a plot involving fictional characters.

The scholar Steven N. Lipkin considers docudrama as a form of performance through recollection which in turn shapes our collective memory of past events. It is a mode of representation. Educator Benicia D&#x27;sa maintained that docudramas are heavily impacted by filmmakers&#x27; own perspectives and understanding of history.

== History ==
The impulse to incorporate historical material into literary texts has been an intermittent feature of literature in the west since its earliest days. Aristotle&#x27;s theory of art is based on the use of putatively historical events and characters. Especially after the development of modern mass-produced literature, there have been genres that relied on history or then-current events for material. English Renaissance drama, for example, developed subgenres specifically devoted to dramatizing recent murders and notorious cases of witchcraft.

However, docudrama as a separate category belongs to the second half of the twentieth century. Louis de Rochemont, creator of &quot;The March of Time&quot;, became a producer at 20th Century Fox in 1943. There he brought the newsreel aesthetic to films, producing a series of movies based upon real events using a realistic style that became known as semidocumentary. The films (&quot;The House on 92nd Street&quot;, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;13 Rue Madeleine&quot;) were imitated, and the style soon became used even for completely-fictional stories, such as &quot;The Naked City&quot;. Perhaps the most significant of the semidocumentary films was &quot;He Walked by Night&quot; (1948), based upon an actual case. Jack Webb had a supporting role in the movie and struck up a friendship with the LAPD consultant, Sergeant Marty Wynn. The film and his relationship with Wynn inspired Webb to create &quot;Dragnet&quot;, one of the most famous docudramas in history.

The particular portmanteau term &quot;docudrama&quot; was coined in 1957 by Philip C. Lewis (1904-1979), of Tenafly, New Jersey, a former vaudevillian and stage actor turned playwright and author, in connection with a production he wrote, in response to the defeat of a local school-funding referendum, for the Tenafly Citizens&#x27; Education Council addressing &quot;the development of education and its significance in American life.&quot; Lewis trademarked the term &quot;DocuDrama&quot; in 1967 (expired, 1992) for a production company of the same name.

The influence of New Journalism tended to create a license for authors to treat with literary techniques material that might in an earlier age have been approached in a purely journalistic way. Both Truman Capote and Norman Mailer were influenced by this movement, and Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is arguably the most famous example of the genre.

== American television ==
Some docudrama examples for American television include &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971), and &quot;Roots&quot; (1977). &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; is the biography of Brian Piccolo, a Chicago Bears football player who died at a young age after battling cancer. &quot;Roots&quot; depicts the life of a slave and his family.

<doc id="213745" wikidata="Q6122576" url="?curid=213745" title="1998 Mazar-i-Sharif massacre">
<text>The 1998 Mazar-i-Sharif massacre took place in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan in 1998. At least 2,000 victims were murdered by the Taliban, with Human Rights Watch estimating that the actual number of victims may be much higher.

The massacre occurred in August 1998, after the Final battle of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–1998), in which the Taliban captured the city from the Northern Alliance forces that the Taliban was fighting a civil war with. After capturing the city Taliban forces perpetrated a massacre of members of the Shia Hazara ethnic group.
==History==
When the Taliban entered Mazar-i-Sharif, they launched a campaign of violence and brutality against the population. The newly installed Taliban governor, Mulla Manon Niazi, delivered speeches at mosques throughout the city in which he threatened to use violence against the Hazara people.

Accusing the Hazaras of killing Taliban prisoners in 1997, Niazi threatened to punish them in retaliation if they did not leave Afghanistan. He warned that other residents of the city would also be punished if they protected Hazaras. In one of his speeches, Niazi ominously warned Hazara residents: &quot;wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up, we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.&quot;

Niazi claimed that the massacres were retaliation for the execution of over 10,000 Taliban militants in Mazar-i-Sharif the year before, by Abdul Malik Pahlawan and Uzbek militants. Although Niazi &quot;knew very well&quot; that it was the Uzbeks, he purposely targeted Hazaras.

It is estimated that thousands of people, including civilians, soldiers, and prisoners of war, were killed during the massacre. The Taliban also systematically targeted some ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks, who were seen as supporters of the Northern Alliance. Over 9,000 Afghan Turkmens fled to Turkmenistan in fears of being targeted in the massacre.

Reports from the time claimed that the Taliban engaged in a range of acts including mass executions, burying people alive, using tanks to crush people to death, slitting throats and shooting people in the testicles.

The Taliban also forcefully converted Shia Muslims to Sunni Islam.

The victims of the massacre included 400 civilians who had sought sanctuary at the Shrine of Hazrat Ali. Despite their efforts to find safety in the holy site, they were ultimately killed by the Taliban. The victims of the massacre included targeted women, children, and the elderly.

Additionally, the Taliban killed eight Iranian officials at the Iranian consulate in the city, as well as an Iranian journalist.

In addition to the killings, the Taliban&#x27;s campaign also included abductions of girls, kidnappings for ransom, torture, rape, arbitrary detention, and rampant looting.

The Hazara people were among those persecuted by the Taliban due to their adherence to the Shi&#x27;a sect of Islam. The Taliban, as followers of a strict conservative Sunni sect, considered Shi&#x27;a to be infidels and sought to impose their religious beliefs on the Hazara population. During their search operations in Mazar-i-Sharif, the Taliban ordered some residents to prove that they were not Shi&#x27;a by reciting Sunni prayers. This religious test was used to identify and target members of the Hazara community.

While the Taliban primarily targeted Hazaras, Human Rights Watch interviewed witnesses who saw or knew of detentions of Uzbeks and Tajiks as well. One interviewed Tajik witness, who had himself been detained, told Human Rights Watch: &quot;Some of the prisoners were beaten, mostly Hazaras. They were tied up and made to lie face down, and then the Taliban would beat them with cables. The Taliban were telling everyone to surrender their arms and tell them where they could find Hazaras. They said, &#x27;If you hand over a Hazara, we will let you go.&#x27;&quot;

The Taliban were meticulous in identifying members of various ethnic groups during their operations. Non-Hazaras were often released, provided someone vouched for them. Human Rights Watch has reported that ethnic Pashtuns were not generally targeted by the Taliban during this time. However, one Pashtun woman who had hidden eight Hazaras was fatally shot dead in her home, along with the individuals she had tried to protect.

The massacre&#x27;s brutality sent shockwaves throughout the international community. It occurred at a time when international tensions with the Taliban were increasing due to their discrimination of women and amid concerns that they were harboring the international terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. On August 20, 1998, the US government issued a warning for non-Muslims to leave Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Iran responded to the situation in neighboring Afghanistan by dispatching troops to its border.

In the weeks after the takeover the Taliban announced the execution of some soldiers who had been responsible for crimes.

The Mazar-i-Sharif massacre was one of the worst incidents in the Afghan Civil War, and it highlighted the need for an end to the conflict. Although the massacre did not receive much global attention or garner much official outrage at the time, human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch have since conducted investigations shedding light on the atrocities that occurred. In the aftermath of the incident, international tensions rapidly escalated with the Taliban regime, until it was ultimately ousted from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan.

Mass graves of Hazaras killed during the massacre were later found in nearby Jaghalkani-i-Takhta Pul.

<text>Białowieża Forest is a large forest complex on the border between Poland and Belarus. It is one of the last and the largest remaining part of the immense primeval forest that once stretched across the European Plain. The forest is home to more than 800 European bisons, Europe&#x27;s heaviest land animal. UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme designated the Polish Biosphere Reserve &#x27; in 1976 and the Belarusian [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park|Biosphere Reserve]]&#x27; in 1993.

In 2015, the Belarusian Biosphere Reserve spanned , subdivided into transition, buffer and core zones. The forest has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an EU Natura 2000 Special Area of Conservation. The World Heritage Committee, through its decision of June 2014, approved the extension of the UNESCO World Heritage site &quot;Belovezhskaya Pushcha / Białowieża Forest, Belarus, Poland&quot;, which became &quot;Białowieża Forest, Belarus, Poland&quot;. It straddles the border between Podlachia historical region in Poland and Brest and Grodno Oblasts in Belarus, and is southeast of Białystok, Poland and north of Brest, Belarus. The Białowieża Forest World Heritage site covers a total area of .
Since the border between the two countries runs through the forest, there is a border crossing available for hikers and cyclists.

== Name ==

The Białowieża Forest takes its name from the Polish village of Białowieża, which is located in the middle of the forest and was probably one of the first human settlements in the area. &quot;Białowieża&quot; means &quot;White Tower&quot; in Polish. The name stems from the white wooden hunting-manor established in the village by Władysław II Jagiełło, the Grand Duke of Lithuania and later King of Poland who enjoyed going on hunting trips in the forest, which was then part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The modern Belarusian name for the forest is &#x27; (), although both the Belarusian authorities and UNESCO use the official Russian name &#x27; () from before the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;list/33&quot;&gt;&quot;Belovezhskaya Pushcha/Białowieża Forest&quot; at the UNESCO official webpage.

== Nature protection ==
=== Białowieża National Park, Poland ===

On the Polish side, part of the Białowieża Forest is protected as the Białowieża National Park (), with an area of about . There is also the Białowieża Glade (), with a complex of buildings once owned by the tsars of Russia during the Partitions of Poland. At present, a hotel and restaurant with a car park is located there. Guided tours into the strictly protected areas of the park can be arranged on foot, bike or by horse-drawn carriage. Approximately 120,000–150,000 tourists visit the Polish part of the forest annually (about 10,000 of them are from other countries). Among the attractions are birdwatching with local ornithologists, the chance to observe rare birds, pygmy owl observations, watching bison in their natural environment, and sledge as well as carriage rides, with a bonfire. Expert nature guides can also be found in the nearby urban centres. Tours are possible all year round. The popular village of Białowieża lies within the forest. &quot;&quot; means &quot;the white tower&quot; in Old Polish.

=== Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park, Belarus ===
On the Belarusian side, the forest is protected as the Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park with an area of . The core, strictly protected, area covers 38%, the zone of regulated use 26,1%, and the touristic zone and economic zone combined 36%; the National Park and World Heritage Site comprises . The headquarters at Kamieniuki include laboratory facilities and a zoo where European bison (reintroduced into the park in 1929), konik (a semi-wild horse), wild boar, Eurasian elk and other indigenous animals may be viewed in enclosures of their natural habitat. A new attraction there is a New Year&#x27;s museum with &quot;Ded Moroz&quot; (the East Slavic counterpart of Father Christmas).

== History ==

The entire area of northeastern Europe was originally covered by ancient woodland similar to that of the Białowieża Forest. Until about the 14th century, travel through the woodland was limited to river routes; roads and bridges appeared much later. Limited hunting rights were granted throughout the forest in the 14th century. In the 15th century the forest became a property of Grand Duke Jogaila. A wooden manor in Białowieża became his refuge during a plague pandemic in 1426. The first recorded piece of legislation on the protection of the forest dates to 1538, when a document issued by Sigismund I instituted the death penalty for poaching a bison. The King also built a new wooden hunting manor in a village of Białowieża, which became the namesake for the whole complex. Since &#x27; means the &quot;white tower&quot;, the corresponding &#x27; translates as the &quot;forest of the white tower&quot;. The Tower of Kamyenyets on the Belarusian side, built of red brick, is also referred to as the White Tower (&#x27;) even though it was never white, perhaps taking the name from the &#x27;.

The forest was declared a hunting reserve in 1541 to protect bison. In 1557, the forest charter was issued, under which a special board was established to examine forest usage. In 1639, King Vladislaus IV issued the &quot;Białowieża royal forest decree&quot; (&#x27;). The document freed all serfs living in the forest in exchange for their service as &#x27;, or royal foresters. They were also freed of taxes in exchange for taking care of the forest. The forest was divided into 12 triangular areas (&quot;&quot;) with a centre in Białowieża.
Until the reign of King John II Casimir, the forest was mostly unpopulated. However, in the late 17th century, several small villages were established for development of local iron-ore deposits and tar production. The villages were populated with settlers from Masovia and Podlaskie and many of them still exist.

After the Partitions of Poland, Tsar Paul I turned all the foresters into serfs and handed them over to various Russian aristocrats and generals along with the parts of forest where they lived. Also, a large number of hunters were able to enter the forest, as all protection was abolished. Following this, the number of bison fell from more than 500 to fewer than 200 in 15 years. However, in 1801, Tsar Alexander I reintroduced the reserve and hired a small number of foresters to protect the animals, and by the 1830s there were 700 bison. However, most of the foresters (500 out of 502) took part in the November Uprising of 1830–31, and their posts were abolished, leading to a breakdown of protection.

Tsar Alexander II visited the forest in 1860 and decided to re-establish the protection of bison. Following his orders, locals killed all predators: wolves, bears and lynx. Between 1888 and 1917, the Russian tsars owned all of primaeval forest, which became the royal hunting reserve. The tsars sent bison as gifts to various European capitals, while at the same time populating the forest with deer, elk and other animals imported from around the empire. 

The last Russian royalty visit was by Czar Nicholas II in 1912.

=== 20th-century wartime damage and restoration ===


During World War I the forest suffered heavy losses. The German army seized the area in August 1915 and started to hunt the animals. During three years of German occupation, of railway tracks were laid in the forest to support the local industry. Three lumber mills were built, in Hajnówka, Białowieża and Gródek. Up to 25 September 1915, at least 200 bison were killed, and an order was issued forbidding hunting in the reserve. However, German soldiers, poachers and Soviet marauders continued the slaughter until February 1919 when the area was captured by the Polish army. The last bison had been killed just a month earlier. Thousands of deer and wild boar had also been shot.

After the Polish–Soviet War in 1921, the core of the forest was declared a National Reserve. In 1923, Professor Józef Paczoski, a pioneer of the science of phytosociology, became a scientific manager of the forest reserves in the Białowieża Forest. He carried out detailed studies of the structure of forest vegetation there.

In 1923 it was known that only 54 European bison survived in zoos all around the world, none of them in Poland. In 1929, a small herd of four was bought by the Polish state from various zoos and from the Western Caucasus (where the bison was to become extinct just a few years later). These animals were of the slightly different Caucasian subspecies (&quot;Bison bonasus caucasicus&quot;). To protect them, in 1932 most of the forest was declared a national park. The reintroduction proved successful, and by 1939 there were 16 bison in Białowieża National Park. Two of them, from the zoo in Pszczyna, were descendants of a pair from the forest given to the Duke of Pszczyna by Tsar Alexander II in 1865.

In 1939 the local inhabitants of Polish ethnicity were deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union and replaced by Soviet forest workers. In 1941 the forest was occupied by Germans and the Russian Soviet inhabitants were also expelled. Hermann Göring planned to create the largest hunting reserve in the world there. After July 1941 the forest became a refuge for both Polish and Soviet partisans and Nazi authorities organised mass executions. A few graves of people who were killed by the Gestapo can still be seen in the forest. (Hermann Göring directed anti-partisan operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the Białowieża Forest between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.) In July 1944 the area was overtaken by the Red Army. Withdrawing Wehrmacht troops demolished the historic Białowieża hunting manor.

After the war, the forest&#x27;s territory was divided between Poland and the Belarusian SSR of the Soviet Union. The chairman of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, Edward Ochab, wrote in his memoirs regarding the negotiations about the demarcation of the border in the area of Białowieża Forest. According to his view, the Soviet officials repeated many times that they were not interested in enlarging their vast state, but only in sorting out the issue of Belarusian and Ukrainian nationalities in the borderland area (Kresy). Ochab emphasized to his Soviet negotiators that the problem didn&#x27;t exist in Białowieża Forest and that the forest had a special historical place in the Polish national memory as a place where guerilla fights took place during the uprising against the tsarist regime. In addition, Poland had its forests decimated by the Germans during the occupation of Poland and finally, the forest was Poland&#x27;s raw material basin for the timber industry in Hajnówka. According to Ochab&#x27;s memories, when Stalin fiercely insisted on the need to &quot;close the case&quot;, Ochab requested a break for consultations in the nearby room. He told his associates from the PKWN that he would resign from his position as the chairman of that body, as he could not find enough spiritual strength and inner conviction to promote Polish–Soviet friendship. The conversation was interrupted and the delegation was escorted to the premises in the seat Union of Polish Patriots and waited for news from the Soviet government. After a half an hour or so, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov called and informed Ochab by phone that Stalin had agreed to transfer half of the forest to Poland including the village of Białowieża and congratulated him. According to Ochab, he was unhappy with the decision as he was counting on the entire Białowieża Forest. 

The Soviet part was put under public administration while Poland reopened the Białowieża National Park in 1947. &quot;&quot; was protected under Decision No. 657 of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Soviet Union, 9 October 1944; Order No. 2252-P of the USSR Council of Ministers, 9 August 1957; and Decree No. 352 of the Byelorussian SSR Council of Ministers, 16 September 1991.

In December 1991, the Belavezha Accords, the decision to dissolve the Soviet Union, were signed at a meeting in the Belarusian part of the reserve by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.

== Composition and ecology ==
Since the forest contains the last remnants of old-growth forests in the North European Plain, it has been the subject of intensive research into the history, succession stages, and community composition of individual tree species and assemblages.

=== Named oaks ===

The forest contains a number of large, ancient pedunculate oaks (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), some of which are individually named. Trunk circumferences are measured at breast height, above the ground.

* Great Mamamuszi. Circumference (2005), height . One of the thickest oaks in the forest, with a beautiful column-like trunk. The tree&#x27;s name comes from Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Bourgeois Gentleman&quot;, in which the main protagonist (Mr Jourdain) was appointed the Mamamouchi by a Turkish ambassador. Since 1989 the tree&#x27;s circumference grew by . Of all the oaks in Białowieża Forest with a circumference above , it is in the best condition.
* The King of Nieznanowo. Circumference , height . This tree has one of the most columnar trunks among the oaks in Białowieża Forest. The first branches arise at the height of 18 m. It has been gradually dying since 1998. , only two small branches still have leaves. Since the mid-1960s its trunk circumference has grown by about .
* Emperor of the South. Circumference , height . The tree shows no clear signs of dying.
* Emperor of the North. Circumference , height . The tree has a very regular trunk and shows no clear signs of dying.
* Southern Cross. Circumference , height . At the base of the trunk it has a considerable lesion in the bark on the eastern side. From the mid-1960s its circumference has grown by . The name comes from the shape of its crown, whose main branches evoke a cross.
* The Guardian of Zwierzyniec. Circumference , height . This is one of the thickest oaks in the forest. The tree is largely bent down westwards, which most probably has contributed to the large circumference of the trunk at its base. All the branches are live, indicating that the tree is in good condition.
* Barrel Oak. Circumference , height over . This tree is named for its barrel-shaped trunk, and is the oak which reaches the greatest trunk circumference among the Białowieża oaks. The tree is dead and largely devoid of bark, and is estimated to be around 450 years old.
* Dominator Oak. Circumference , height over . One of the thickest oaks of the Białowieża, the tree has been dead since 1992 and its trunk is now largely devoid of bark. For many years it dominated the Białowieża Forest as far as size is concerned. Its age is estimated at 450 years.
* The Jagiełło Oak. Circumference (when growing) , height . It blew down in 1974, but is probably the most famous of the trees in the forest. It is said that King Władysław II Jagiełło rested beneath it before the Battle of Grunwald (Bitwa Pod Grunwaldem) in 1410, although the tree is believed to have been only 450 years old when it blew down.
* Tsar Oak (Polish) () of Poland. Circumference , height . The tree&#x27;s volume has been estimated at . It died in 1984, and for over 20 years it has been standing dead on the edge of the valley of Leśna Prawa river. Today the trunk is totally devoid of bark and some of the branches have broken off and lie at the base of the trunk.
* Patriarch Oak (). One of the oldest oaks in the Belarusian National Park, standing tall, having a diameter in excess of , and being over 550 years of age. It stands from the estate of Ded Moroz.

== Logging ==

Some 84% of the of Polish forest is outside the national park; almost half of all the wood in the forest is dead – 10 times more than in managed forests – with half the 12,000 species depend on decaying logs, including the near-threatened beetle &quot;Cucujus cinnaberinus&quot;. Traditional forest management would remove the dead wood, as a fire risk. In 2011, Zdzisław Szkiruć, director of the Białowieża National Park, said that cutting and replanting allows for re-establishment of the forest in 50 years, rather than the 300–400 years that nature would require; environmentalist Janusz Korbel argued that the unique nature of the primeval forest demands a lighter style of management. Andrzej Kraszewski, Poland&#x27;s Environment Minister from February 2010 to November 2011, sought to increase protection over the whole forest, starting with a more modest expansion, against opposition from the local community and the Forestry Service.

Environmentalists say that logging is threatening the flora and fauna in the forest, including species of rare birds, such as the white-backed woodpecker, who lost 30% of their population in forestry-managed areas in the 1990s and 2000s. Poland&#x27;s state forestry board claims the logging is for protection and for ecological reasons, protecting against the European spruce bark beetle. In 2012, the amount of wood that can be extracted by foresters annually was briefly reduced from about to , approximately 20,000,000 board feet, most which is sold locally, mainly as firewood.

On 25 March 2016, Jan Szyszko, Poland&#x27;s Environment Minister, former forester and forestry academic, announced that he would approve a tripling of logging in the forest, from the 2012–21 limit of – almost exhausted at the time – to , offering the excuse of &quot;combatting an infestation of the bark beetle&quot;. Robert Cyglicki, head of Greenpeace Polska, argued that logging to fight the bark beetle would &quot;bring more damage than benefits&quot;, gathering more than 120,000 signatures to petition Prime Minister Beata Szydło to reverse Szyszko&#x27;s move. Greenpeace also said the logging could trigger the EU to launch punitive procedures against Poland for violating its Natura 2000 programme, though Szyszko claims that the logging plans would not apply to strictly protected areas, and claims that, rather than being 8,000 years old, as scientists claim, parts of the forest had been created by an &quot;enterprising hand of man&quot; on lands that centuries ago included fields of wheat and millet.

Large-scale logging started in 2017. 190,000 cubic metres of wood (160,000 to 180,000 trees) was felled, the largest volume of logging since 1988. The Polish government has ignored pleas from UNESCO to stop logging the old-growth parts of the forest, as well as a court order of the European Court of Justice to halt the logging activities. The final verdict fell on 17 April 2018, ruling that EU law has been infringed.

== In popular culture ==

* The forest is the subject of a Belarusian ballad &quot;&quot;, composed in 1975 by Aleksandra Pakhmutova, with lyrics by Nikolai Dobronravov, performed by Belarusian folk band Pesniary.
* Białowieża Forest is mentioned throughout Alan Weisman&#x27;s book &quot;The World Without Us&quot; (2007), which investigates places that have been abandoned or left alone and imagines what they would be like if Earth&#x27;s human population suddenly disappeared.
* British historian Simon Schama devotes several chapters of his book &quot;Landscape and Memory&quot; (1995) to the Białowieża Forest.
* In late 2017, Wojtek Voiteque Kowalik, a senior copy editor at the Polish advertising firm Ogilvy, decided to work with Greenpeace Poland to spread awareness of the Białowieża Forest and the logging threatening it. Kowalik decided to use the game &quot;Minecraft&quot;, as he wanted to capitalize on its playerbase of 87 million. Kowalik reasoned &quot;Minecraft&quot; was a form of social media, drawing parallels between the YouTube and Twitch communities dedicated to the game and the video arcades of his youth. Kowalik contacted Danish company GeoBoxers, who had previously recreated all of Denmark in &quot;Minecraft&quot; in 1:1 scale, and convinced them to do the same for Białowieża Forest. In return Ogilvy and Greenpeace provided reference material for Geoboxers in the form of a 3D topographical map of the forest made from hundreds of images and maps of Białowieża Forest that took six weeks to complete.
* The action of a role-playing video game &quot;&quot; developed by Different Tales and released on 13 October 2020 (for MS Windows, Linux and Mac OS) takes place in Białowieża Forest. The player takes the role of Maia Boroditch, an American woman of Polish descent, who has recurring nightmares about a forest and wolves, and travels to Białowieża in Poland to learn about her family history and discovers secrets of the primeval Białowieża Forest.
* The forest is mentioned in Upton Sinclair&#x27;s seminal novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906). It is the birthplace of protagonist Jurgis Rudkus.
* The forest is a key focus in the 2021 nonfiction book &quot;Into the Forest: A Holocaust Story of Survival, Triumph, and Love&quot; by Rebecca Frankel. The book describes the experience of a Jewish family that fled into the forest during the Nazi occupation in 1942.
* The forest is the setting of author-translator Jennifer Croft&#x27;s 2024 novel &quot;The Extinction of Irena Rey.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Bourbon&quot; was a frigate in the Continental Navy, named for the House of Bourbon.

During the American Revolutionary War, &quot;Bourbon&quot; was authorized as a 36-gun frigate by the Continental Congress 23 January 1777. Very little else is known about it, but it may have been built at Chatham, Connecticut. Due to the Congress&#x27;s financial difficulties, it was not launched until 31 July 1783. In September 1783, still uncompleted, it was offered for sale and presumably sold.

<doc id="213765" wikidata="Q484079" url="?curid=213765" title="Führer">
<text>( , spelled Fuehrer when the umlaut is unavailable) is a German word meaning &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;guide&quot;. As a political title, it is strongly associated with Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. Hitler officially styled himself der Führer und Reichskanzler (the Leader and Chancellor of the Reich) after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934 and the subsequent merging of the offices of &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; and &quot;Reichskanzler&quot;. 

Nazi Germany cultivated the (&quot;leader principle&quot;), and Hitler was generally known as simply (&quot;the Leader&quot;).

In compound words, the use of remains common in German and is used in words such as (travel guide), (museum docent), (mountain guide), or (leader of the opposition). However, because of its strong association with Hitler, the isolated word itself usually has negative connotations when used with the meaning of &quot;leader&quot;, especially in political contexts. 

The word has cognates in the Scandinavian languages, spelled &quot;&quot; in Danish and Norwegian. In Norwegian, the word has the same meaning as the German word. The Norwegian word for mayor is &quot;ordfører&quot;, literally meaning &quot;word leader&quot;. In Swedish &quot;Ordförande&quot; means Chairman and applies to a wide range of situations, for example in corporate boards or as the head of an official gathering of members. In Swedish and Danish, &quot;&quot; and &quot;fører&quot; normally means &quot;driver&quot; (of a vehicle), a meaning &quot;Führer&quot; can also have in German. However, in the compound word &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, that part does mean &quot;leader&quot;, and is a cognate of the German &quot;Heerführer&quot; (military leader).

==History==
===Background===
 has been used as a military title (compare Latin &quot;Dux&quot;) in Germany since at least the 18th century. The usage of the term &quot;Führer&quot; in the context of a company-sized military subunit in the German Army referred to a commander lacking the qualifications for permanent command. For example, the commanding officer of a company was titled &quot;&quot;Kompaniechef&quot;&quot; (), but if he did not have the requisite rank or experience, or was only temporarily assigned to command, he was officially titled &quot;Kompanieführer&quot;. Thus operational commands of various military echelons were typically referred to by their formation title followed by the title , in connection with mission-type tactics used by the German military forces. The term was also used at lower levels, regardless of experience.

===Origins of the political concept===
The first example of the political use of was with Austrian Georg Ritter von Schönerer (1842–1921), a major exponent of pan-Germanism and German nationalism in Austria, whose followers commonly referred to him as the , and who also used the Roman salute – where the right arm and hand are held rigidly outstretched – which they called the &quot;German greeting&quot;. According to historian Richard J. Evans, this use of &quot; by Schönerer&#x27;s Pan-German Association, probably introduced the term to the German far-right, but its specific adoption by the Nazis may also have been influenced by the use in Italy of &quot;, also meaning &quot;leader&quot;, as an informal title for Benito Mussolini, the Fascist Prime Minister, and later (from 1922) dictator, of that country.

=== of the Nazi Party===
Adolf Hitler took the title to denote his function as head of the Nazi Party; he received it in 1921 when, infuriated over party founder Anton Drexler&#x27;s plan to merge with another antisemitic far-right nationalist party, he resigned from the party. Drexler and the party&#x27;s Executive Committee then acquiesced to Hitler&#x27;s demand to be made the chairman of the party with &quot;dictatorial powers&quot; as the condition for his return.

=== and Chancellor===

In 1933, Hitler was appointed (Chancellor of the Reich) by President Paul von Hindenburg.

A month later, the decision to vote with the Nazi Party taken by the MPs of the Centre Party allowed the Nazi-dominated Reichstag to reach the qualified constitutional two-thirds majority required for passage of the Enabling Act allowing the cabinet to promulgate laws by decree, rendering in practice the system of checks and balances defunct. The Act became the official legal justification for such decrees later routinely issued by Hitler himself.

==== and Chancellor of the German Reich====
One day before Hindenburg&#x27;s death, Hitler and his cabinet decreed the &quot;Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich&quot;, which stipulated that upon Hindenburg&#x27;s death, the office of the president was to be merged with that of Chancellor. Thus, upon Hindenburg&#x27;s death, Hitler became – although eventually was quietly dropped from day-to-day usage and retained only in official documents. Hitler therefore assumed the President&#x27;s powers without assuming the office itself – ostensibly out of respect for Hindenburg&#x27;s achievements as a heroic figure in World War I. The Enabling Act had specifically prohibited legislation that would affect the position or powers of the Reich President, but the first one-party Reichstag elected in November 1933 had passed an act on the first anniversary of Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor, 30 January 1934, abolishing those restrictions. It was then approved by a referendum on 19 August.

==== and Chancellor of the Greater German Reich====
On 28 July 1942, the title was changed to &quot;&quot; (Leader and Chancellor of the Greater German Reich).

=== and Supreme Commander of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;===

According to the Weimar Constitution, the President was the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Unlike &quot;President&quot;, Hitler did take this title () for himself. When conscription was reintroduced in 1935, Hitler created the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, a post held by the Minister of War. He retained the title of Supreme Commander for himself. Soldiers had to swear allegiance to Hitler as &quot; (Leader of the German Reich and Nation). Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, then the Minister of War and one of those who created the Hitler oath, or the personal oath of loyalty of the military to Hitler, became the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces while Hitler remained Supreme Commander. Following the Blomberg–Fritsch affair in 1938, Hitler assumed the commander-in-chief&#x27;s post as well and took personal command of the armed forces. However, he continued using the older formally higher title of Supreme Commander, which was thus filled with a somewhat new meaning. Combining it with &quot;Führer&quot;, he used the style (Leader and Supreme Commander of the ), yet a simple &quot;Führer&quot; after May 1942.

=== of the German Reich and Nation===
Soldiers had to swear allegiance to Hitler as &quot; (Leader of the German Reich and Nation). In his political testament, Hitler also referred to himself as (Leader of the Nation).

===Germanic &quot;Führer&quot;===

An additional title was adopted by Hitler on 23 June 1941 when he declared himself the &quot;Germanic Führer&quot; (), in addition to his duties as &quot;Führer&quot; of the German state and people. This was done to emphasise Hitler&#x27;s professed leadership of what the Nazis described as the &quot;Nordic-Germanic master race&quot;, which was considered to include peoples such as the Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Dutch, and others in addition to the Germans, and the intent to annex these countries to the German Reich to form the Greater Germanic Reich (). &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; formations from these countries had to declare obedience to Hitler by addressing him in this fashion. On 12 December 1941, Dutch fascist Anton Mussert also addressed him as such when he proclaimed his allegiance to Hitler during a visit to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. He had wanted to address Hitler as (&quot;Führer of all Germanics&quot;), but Hitler personally decreed the former style. Historian Loe de Jong speculates on the difference between the two: implied a position separate from Hitler&#x27;s role as (&quot;Führer and Reich Chancellor of the Greater German Reich&quot;), while served more as an attribute of that main function. As late as 1944, however, occasional propaganda publications continued to refer to him by this unofficial title.

One of the Nazis&#x27; most-repeated political slogans was – &quot;One People, One Empire, One Leader&quot;. Historian says the slogan &quot;left an indelible mark on the minds of most Germans who lived through the Nazi years. It appeared on countless posters and in publications; it was heard constantly in radio broadcasts and speeches.&quot; The slogan emphasised the absolute control of the leader over practically every sector of German society and culture – with the churches being formally the most notable exception. The designation itself was initially used only in the context of the Nazi Party, though its meaning gradually sprawled to cover the German state, the German Armed Forces, the German nation, and ultimately all the Germanic peoples.

Hitler&#x27;s word became in practice absolute and ultimate, even when incompatible with the constitution, as he saw himself as the sole source of power in Germany, similar to the Roman emperors and German early medieval leaders. In spite of that, he took great care to maintain the pretence of legality of his dictatorship. He issued thousands of decrees that were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree. That decree itself was based on Article 48 of the constitution, which gave the president the power to take measures deemed necessary to protect public order. The Enabling Act was renewed in 1937 for four years and again in 1939 for four years by the Reichstag. In 1943, it was extended indefinitely by a decree from Hitler himself. Those extensions by the Reichstag were merely a formality with all other parties having been banned.

However, Hitler had a narrow range of interest – mostly involving diplomacy and the military – and so his subordinates interpreted his vaguely formulated orders and wishes in a manner beneficial to their own interests or those of their organisations. This led to vicious power wrangles that were immensely beneficial to Hitler in aiding him to ensure that no subordinate amassed enough power to challenge or jeopardise his absolute rule.

==Usage in lower ranks of Nazi Germany==
Regional Nazi Party leaders were called , &quot;&quot; also meaning &quot;leader&quot;. Almost every Nazi paramilitary organisation, in particular the SS and SA, had Nazi Party paramilitary ranks incorporating the title of . The SS including the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, like all paramilitary Nazi organisations, called all their members of any rank except the lowest one a of something; thus confusingly, was also an official rank title for a specific grade of general. The word was also a generic word referring to any commander or leader of troops and could be applied to NCOs or officers at many different levels of command.

==Modern German usage==
In Germany, the isolated word &quot; is usually avoided in political contexts, due to its intimate connection with Nazi institutions and with Hitler personally. However, the suffix is used in many compound words. Examples include (mountain guide), (human tourist guide), (manager), (travel guidebook), (team captain — also referred to as ), and (command duty officer/officer of the watch). 

When used in the context of vehicles and traffic, it is often interchangeable with the suffix (vehicle driver): (road vehicle driver), (train driver), (skipper); however, it is worth noticing the exception of the pair (car driver) and (road guidebook). It may also be used in this context as a prefix such as in (driver&#x27;s license), (train cabin), or (truck cabin). 

Since German is a language with grammatical gender, refers to a male leader; the feminine form is . 

The use of alternative terms like &quot; (a borrowing from the French, as is the English &quot;chief&quot;, e.g. ) or (often in compound words like , , or ) is usually not the result of replacing of the word &quot;Führer&quot;, but rather using terminology that existed before the Nazis. The use of to refer to a political party leader is rare today and (chairman) is the more common term. However, the word (&quot;leader of the [parliamentary] opposition&quot;) is more commonly used.

==In fiction==
In the manga series &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (2001–2010), by Hiromu Arakawa the character of King Bradley (King being his given name) has the title Fuhrer-President of Amestris being that the country is a military dictatorship.

<text>The little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), also known as dabchick, is a member of the grebe family of water birds. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;takhus&quot; &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;bapto&quot; &quot;to sink under&quot;. The specific &quot;ruficollis&quot; is from Latin &quot;rufus&quot; &quot;red&quot; and Modern Latin &quot;-collis&quot;, &quot;-necked&quot;, itself derived from Latin &quot;collum&quot; &quot;neck&quot;.

At in length it is the smallest European member of its family. It is commonly found in open bodies of water across most of its range.

==Taxonomy==
The little grebe was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name &quot;Colymbus ruficollis&quot;. The tricolored grebe was formerly considered conspecific, with some taxonomic authorities still considering it so. 

===Subspecies===
Seven subspecies are currently accepted, four widespread, and three with restricted ranges; they are separated principally by size, eye colour, which varies from dark to light from west to east, and extent of white on the secondary feathers of the wing, which varies from none in temperate northern regions, to extensive white in tropical regions.

==Description==
The little grebe is a small water bird with a pointed bill. The adult is unmistakable in summer, predominantly dark above with its rich, rufous colour neck, cheeks and flanks, and bright yellow gape. The rufous is replaced by a dirty brownish grey in non-breeding and juvenile birds.

Juvenile birds have a yellow bill with a small black tip, and black and white streaks on the cheeks and sides of the neck as seen below. This yellow bill darkens as the juveniles age, eventually turning black in adulthood.

In winter, its size, buff plumage, with a darker back and cap, and “powder puff” rear end enable easy identification of this species. The little grebe&#x27;s breeding call, given singly or in duet, is a trilled repeated &quot;weet-weet-weet&quot; or &quot;wee-wee-wee&quot; which sounds like a horse whinnying.

==Distribution==
This bird breeds in small colonies in heavily vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe, much of Asia down to New Guinea, and most of Africa. Most birds move to more open or coastal waters in winter, but it is only migratory in those parts of its range where the waters freeze. Outside of breeding season, it moves into more open water, occasionally even appearing on the coast in small bays.

==Behaviour==
The little grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver and pursues its fish and aquatic invertebrate prey underwater. It uses the vegetation skilfully as a hiding place.

Like all grebes, it nests at the water&#x27;s edge, since its legs are set very far back and it cannot walk well. Usually four to seven eggs are laid. When the adult bird leaves the nest it usually takes care to cover the eggs with weeds. This makes it less likely to be detected by predators. The young leave the nest and can swim soon after hatching, and chicks are often carried on the backs of the swimming adults. In India, the species breeds during the rainy season.

<text>The first USS &quot;Raritan&quot; was a wooden-hulled, three-masted sailing frigate of the United States Navy built at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, laid down in 1820, but not launched until 13 June 1843, sponsored by Commodore Frederick Engle. She was one of the last sailing frigates of the United States Navy.

On 20 February 1844 the frigate, commanded by Captain Francis H. Gregory, cleared New York Harbor and sailed for the South Atlantic where she served as Commodore Daniel Turner&#x27;s flagship until she returned to the United States in November 1845.

Based at Pensacola, Florida, &quot;Raritan&quot; then operated with the Home Squadron as it blockaded the east coast of Mexico and supported Army forces during the war with Mexico. As Commodore David Conner&#x27;s flagship, she joined USS &quot;Potomac&quot; in landing 500 men at Point Isabel to reinforce that military depot in May 1846. During 1847, she participated in the landings at Veracruz in March; at Tuxpan in April; and at Tabasco in June.

&quot;Raritan&quot; then retired to Norfolk where she was laid up in ordinary during 1848. Active again in 1849, she served as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, then as flagship for the Home Squadron, and in 1850 was transferred to the Pacific to cruise between Panama and Cape Horn and as far west as the International Date Line. &quot;Raritan&quot; arrived at Valparaíso in June 1851. On 31 August, the British merchant ship &quot;Governor Davis&quot; ran aground in the Bogueron Passage. Attempts by &quot;Raritan&quot; to refloat her were unsuccessful and she was abandoned. &quot;Raritan&quot; returned to the United States in October 1852. On her arrival home, she was again laid up, in ordinary, at Norfolk. &quot;Raritan&quot; remained there until she was destroyed, 20 April 1861, by Union forces as they evacuated the navy yard.

<text>Done by the Forces of Nature is the second studio album by American hip hop group Jungle Brothers, released on November 7, 1989, by Warner Bros. Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in 1989 at Calliope Studios in New York City, and production was handled by the Jungle Brothers. It was mixed at Apollo Studios by Kool DJ Red Alert and the Jungle Brothers. The album&#x27;s title may refer to a line from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, a Hindu scripture, wherein Krishna says, &quot;Those who are deluded by the illusive power (Maya) of Nature become attached to the work done by the forces of nature,&quot; 3:28.

&quot;Done by the Forces of Nature&quot; peaked at number 46 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It also received rave reviews from music critics who praised its Afrocentric themes, clever lyrics, house-influenced production, and eclectic sampling of music genres such as jazz, R&amp;B, funk, and African music. &quot;Done by the Forces of Nature&quot; has been considered a golden age hip hop classic, as well as one of the greatest and influential hip hop albums of all time. In 1998, it was included in &quot;The Source&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list.

==Recording==
Recording sessions for the album took place in 1989 at Calliope Studios in New York City, and production was handled by the Jungle Brothers. It was mixed at Apollo Studios by Kool DJ Red Alert and the Jungle Brothers.

==Reception and legacy==
In a positive review for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, Greg Tate hailed &quot;Done by the Forces of Nature&quot; as an innovative hip house production and, &quot;a nonstop groove-a-think where sexist spectacle commingles with love paeans to the sistuhs, where safaris into Afro-centricity are made to house you.&quot; Robert Tanzilo from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;one of the brightest records of the year&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Duff Marlowe praised the album&#x27;s diverse sound and lyrical themes, including social consciousness and individual self-realization. He wrote that the Jungle Brothers &quot;present a vision of urbanized naturalism, a subversive and funky anti-intellectualism&quot;. Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the album &quot;some seriously intense music that makes the commercial raps of Tone-Loc and DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; Fresh Prince sound like a child&#x27;s play&quot;. Peter Watrous from &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed lyrical allusions to hip hop and African-American culture that are &quot;enriching an always solid dance beat&quot;.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Azerrad praised the Jungle Brothers&#x27; lyrical substance and said their &quot;positive, spiritual vibe (a direct descendant of Earth, Wind and Fire&#x27;s) is as hip as their music&quot;. Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Brett Anderson described it as the Jungle Brothers&#x27; &quot;stab at edutainment&quot;. Steve Huey from AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s eclectic sound and sampling of music genres such as jazz, R&amp;B, and African music. In comparing the album to the Jungle Brothers&#x27; landmark debut album, &quot;Straight out the Jungle&quot; (1988), Huey wrote that &quot;Done by the Forces of Nature&quot; &quot;feels more realized in many respects, and is arguably the more satisfying listen&quot;. French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; called the album &quot;brilliant&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found its sound &quot;as original as De La Soul&#x27;s, and the dreams of pleasure are straight out the urban jungle&quot;:

The album has been considered a classic of hip hop&#x27;s golden age and one of the most influential albums in hip hop. It has also been described by critics as an &quot;underrated classic&quot;. Michael Azerrad, writing in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, said that it was &quot;largely overlooked,&quot; but is &quot;one of rap&#x27;s finest hours&quot; with a &quot;highly musical hip-hop&quot; that &quot;radiates upbeat spirituality&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Rick Reger called it a &quot;masterpiece ... one of hip-hop&#x27;s most imaginative, engaging records&quot;. In retrospect, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Nathan Brackett wrote &quot;At their prime in the late &#x27;80s, the Jungle Brothers reflected all of hip-hop&#x27;s potential – their second album, 1989&#x27;s spiritual, street-wise &quot;Done by the Forces of Nature&quot;, was as conscious as it was funky and stands out as one of the most overlooked rap albums of that decade.&quot; In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Peter Relic comments that the &quot;Jungle Brothers were ahead of their time&quot; with the album and cites the track &quot;Doin&#x27; Our Own Dang&quot; as &quot;the definitive Native Tongues posse cut&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album thirty-seventh on its list of &quot;The 50 Coolest Records&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Done by the Forces of Nature&quot; was included in &quot;The Source&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Just a Poet with Soul is the debut studio album by American rapper and record producer Def Jef. It was released on November 14, 1989, through Delicious Vinyl. The album was produced by the Dust Brothers, Def Jef, and Michael Ross, who also served as executive producer. It features contributions from N&#x27;Dea Davenport and Etta James on vocals, Kevin O&#x27;Neal on bass, Michael Kory on piano, and Julio G on turntables. The album produced three singles: &quot;Droppin Rhymes on Drums&quot;, &quot;Black to the Future&quot; and &quot;Poet with Soul&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; opined that Def Jef &quot;spends more time bragging about how cleverly he can say what he says than he does actually saying anything—an all-too-common rap trick... But the album is redeemed as entertainment by the Dust Brothers&#x27; funky Cali co-production and inventive use of sampling.&quot;

<doc id="213777" wikidata="Q640238" url="?curid=213777" title="All Hail the Queen">
<text>All Hail the Queen is the debut studio album by American rapper Queen Latifah. The album was released on November 7, 1989, through Tommy Boy Records. The feminist anthem &quot;Ladies First&quot;, featuring Monie Love, remains one of Latifah&#x27;s signature songs.

&quot;All Hail the Queen&quot; peaked at no. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Hip Hop/R&amp;B Albums chart and at no. 124 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Wrath of My Madness&quot; was the first single from &quot;All Hail the Queen,&quot; and was later sampled in Yo-Yo&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Play with My Yo-Yo&quot;. &quot;Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children&quot; peaked at no. 14 in the UK.

In 2023, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;the backup tracks are sometimes rich enough to carry the album on their own, but they don&#x27;t have to; some songs have vocal choruses, while in others Queen Latifah&#x27;s rising and falling speech provides melody enough.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; called the album &quot;international ghetto music filtered through hip-hop&#x27;s strongest feminist sensibility.&quot;

In 1998, &quot;All Hail the Queen&quot; was included in &quot;The Source&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list. It was later featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2008, the single &quot;Ladies First&quot; was ranked number 35 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.

== Legacy ==
In 2023, &quot;All Hail the Queen&quot; was inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry, based on its &quot;cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation’s recorded sound heritage.&quot; In their statement explaining their inclusion of the album, the Library of Congress said, &quot;[Queen Latifah&#x27;s] album showed rap could cross genres including reggae, hip-hop, house, and jazz – while also opening opportunities for other female rappers.&quot;

<text>The Native Tongues was a collective of late 1980s and early 1990s hip-hop artists known for their positive-minded, good-natured Afrocentric lyrics, and for pioneering the use of eclectic sampling and jazz-influenced beats. Its principal members were the Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Monie Love, and Queen Latifah. The collective was also closely tied to the Universal Zulu Nation. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cites the track &quot;Doin&#x27; Our Own Dang&quot; as &quot;the definitive Native Tongues posse cut&quot;.

==Naming==

The Native Tongues took their name from a line in the song &quot;African Cry&quot;, by Motown-offshoot funk group New Birth, which features the lyric, &quot;took away our native tongues&quot;.

==History==

The New York City-based Native Tongues crew was a collective of like-minded hip hop artists who would help bring abstract and open-minded lyricism that addressed a range of topics—from spirituality and modern living to race, sex, and just having fun—to the mainstream. Together with the use of eclectic samples that would take on an increasingly jazzy sound, they would be pioneers of so-called conscious hip hop, alternative hip hop, and jazz rap.

De La Soul&#x27;s Trugoy the Dove recalled: &quot;The Native Tongues came about where, basically, we had a show together in Boston. [De La Soul], Jungle [Brothers] and we linked from there. We had a natural love for the art and a natural love for each other on how we put stuff together. So we invited [the Jungle Brothers] to a session, and when they hooked up with us, we happened to be doing &quot;Buddy.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t business; it wasn&#x27;t for a check. It was just trading ideas and just seeing what you&#x27;re doing. Bottom line, it was just having fun.&quot;

According to Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest: &quot;I remember Afrika [Baby Bam] called me that night, like, two in the morning. &quot;Yo these kids, De La Soul, you gotta meet ’em! I swear we&#x27;re just alike!&quot; I went there, met them, and it was just fuckin&#x27; love at first sight. It was disgusting. In hip hop, it praises individualism. I think that&#x27;s the main achievement of the Native Tongues. It just showed people could come together.&quot;

Fostered by Kool DJ Red Alert, the success of the Jungle Brothers would pave the way for De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest; together, these three groups would form the core of the crew and continue the spirit of Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation. By 1989 they had been joined by Queen Latifah and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Monie Love, and soon by the Black Sheep and Chi-Ali. Collectively, the members of the Native Tongues had a huge effect on the style and trends of hip hop during its most important period, the golden age of the late 1980s–early 1990s. A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul&#x27;s albums of this time are considered among the best and most important in the hip hop genre.

While featuring an extensive discography, the collaborations of the Native Tongues have been fairly limited: the collective never recorded anything under that name, and the number of notable crew cuts can be counted on one hand. The various groups grew distant with time, and, by 1993, De La Soul&#x27;s Trugoy the Dove proclaimed, &quot;That native shit is dead.&quot;

==Legacy==

The Native Tongues are regarded as one of the first alternative hip hop movements; by diverging from popular models of hard-edged braggadocio, pursuing more experimental subject matter, and sampling more diverse types of music, they renewed the focus on individualism in hip hop. The innovations of the Native Tongues have been credited with facilitating the emergence of artists such as OutKast, Kanye West, and Pharrell Williams.

In 2019, the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., launched an annual Native Tongues Festival to celebrate the musical legacy of the Native Tongues.

<doc id="213782" wikidata="Q494917" url="?curid=213782" title="Virgin Group">
<text>Virgin Group is a British multinational venture capital conglomerate founded by Richard Branson and Nik Powell in February 1970.

Virgin Group&#x27;s date of incorporation is listed as 1989 by Companies House, who class it as a holding company; however, Virgin&#x27;s business and trading activities date back to the 1970s. The net worth of Virgin Group was estimated at £3 billion as of early 2023.

==History==
The name &quot;Virgin&quot; arose in 1970 when Richard Branson and Nik Powell formed a record shop, first as mail order and in 1971 with a physical store. They considered themselves virgins in business. Branson has described the &quot;V&quot; in the logo as an expressive tick, representing the Virgin seal of approval.

The original logo from 1973 was a completely different design intended to be used for the record company that was founded by Richard Branson and Nik Powell. The logo was designed by British science-fiction artist and designer Roger Dean. According to Richard Branson in interviews and on the Virgin website, the more recent signature logo, introduced in 1978, was based on one that designer Ray Kyte scribbled on a napkin after a design meeting.

==Corporate affairs==
Virgin Group has its headquarters in Whitfield Studios in Soho, a district of the City of Westminster. The group moved to this location in November 2024; the space is renowned for its music history as a creative hub for musical legends such as the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Spice Girls &amp; Amy Winehouse. 

Whitfield Studios also houses the head offices for other Virgin Group owned companies, such as Virgin Red, Virgin Unite, Virgin StartUp, Virgin Limited Edition &amp; Big Change.

Previously, the Virgin Group were based at the Porchester Building in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, The Battleship Building in Paddington, a district of the City of Westminster and at The School House in Brook Green, in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

The Virgin Group of companies have a complex structure that contains elements of a generic conglomerate and a &quot;keiretsu&quot;, and sometimes it simply licences its brand. Examples of licensing are Virgin Records and Virgin Media, which are owned by Universal Music Group and Liberty Global respectively.

In mid-May 2013, the Virgin Group expressed its intention to seek out opportunities in Australia&#x27;s healthcare industry to consolidate on the Group&#x27;s Australian fitness centres. The Group also runs over 100 National Health Service (NHS) services in the United Kingdom and the healthcare division of medical services group Assura after entering the British healthcare industry in 2011.

Virgin Group announced the establishment of Virgin Voyages on 4 December 2014 with financial backing from Bain Capital. The cruise line would be led by CEO Tom McAlpin, would have two new large ships built and be based in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area.

===Virgin StartUp===
Virgin StartUp is the Virgin Group&#x27;s non-profit company, helping entrepreneurs across the UK to start, fund and scale their business. In 2013, Branson visited Boxpark in Shoreditch, London, to launch the new organisation, revealing that he wanted to support anyone that had the same dreams and ambitions that he did as a young boy: “It was £300 from my mum that sparked the Virgin adventure 40 years ago. Today, young people need that same help and I believe Virgin StartUp will provide it – with access to early capital, strong mentorship, advice and promotion.”

The organisation became a delivery partner for the UK Government&#x27;s Start Up Loans Company, providing loan finance of between £500 and £25,000, advice, and mentoring to thousands of start-ups across the country. In 2016, it was awarded European Regional Development Funding and subsequently launched Ready, Steady, Grow with Virgin StartUp, a programme of support aimed at start-ups that were ready to grow. A year later, it launched the UK&#x27;s first equity-based crowdfunding accelerator programme, Crowdboost.

By 2018, the organisation had supported over 11,000 UK-based entrepreneurs, with over £35m in pre-seed funding.

====Foodpreneur====
In 2014, Branson and Virgin StartUp launched the &quot;Foodpreneur&quot; food and drink focused start-up competition. Winners received mentorship from Branson, legal support, and brand counseling. The 2014 winners included Proper Beans, Killer Tomato, Sweetpea Pantry, and Sweet Virtues.

In 2015, winners were given the opportunity to pitch Target Corporation buyers in the US. The 2015 winners included Pip &amp; Nut, Double Dutch Drinks, Harry Bromptons, Cauli Rice, and Mallow and Marsh.

Only one start-up was announced winner of the 2017 Foodpreneur prize, The Snaffling Pig Co., who won a six-week rental space at Intu Lakeside, the retail center with the highest foot traffic in the U.K.

The NHS bodies settled out of court with a £328,000 payout to Virgin Care, resulting in some controversy. More than 100,000 people backed a petition calling on the company to stop &quot;dragging the NHS through the courts&quot;.

<doc id="213783" wikidata="Q228880" url="?curid=213783" title="Universal Zulu Nation">
<text>The Universal Zulu Nation is an international hip hop awareness group formed by electro/hip hop artist Afrika Bambaataa.

According to the website of the UZN, the Zulu Nation stands for &quot;knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom, justice, equality, peace, unity, love, respect, work, fun, overcoming the negative to the positive, economics, mathematics, science, life, truth, facts, faith, and the oneness of god&quot;.

== History ==
Originally known simply as the Organization, it arose in the 1970s from the reformed New York City gang the Black Spades, a street gang from the South Bronx. While the Black Spades were the base of the organization, other reformed gangs contributed additional members, notably the Savage Nomads, Seven Immortals, and Savage Skulls, among others. Members began to organize cultural events for youths, combining local dance and music movements into what would become known as the various elements of hip hop culture. Elements of the culture include Emceeing (MCing), Deejaying (DJing), breaking (Breakdancing), and writing (Graffiti).

In many interviews, Afrika Bambaataa has spoken of the name &quot;Zulu&quot; as being inspired by the 1964 film of the same name.

The imagery of the Zulu Nation has varied at times as well. During the 1970s and the 1980s, Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation members would often clothe themselves in costumes representing different cultures of the world.

Since the early 1980s, the Zulu Nation has established autonomous branches in Japan, France, the UK, Australia, Canada, South Korea and the Cape Flats in Cape Town South Africa.

From the late 1980s, at the height of the Afrocentric movement in Hip Hop (when artists such as KRS-One, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Native Tongues, and Rakim hit success), the movement seemed to be incorporating many doctrines from the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, and the Nuwaubians. In the mid-1990s, some members began to break off starting their own projects or organizations such as &quot;Ill Crew Universal&quot;.

Afrika Bambaataa stood down as head of the Zulu Nation in May 2016 after allegations of sexually abusing several young men and children in the organization. Ronald Savage was the first of several men to publicly accuse Bambaataa.

In 2017, hundreds of Zulus resigned due to distrust of the Zulu Nation and founded their own organization, the Zulu Union.

==Zulu Nation in France==
The Zulu movement was introduced to France in 1982 by Afrika Bambaataa when the New York City Rap Tour performed in several cities (Paris, Lyon, Metz, Belfort, Mulhouse) with artists PHASE 2, Futura 2000, Dondi, Grandmaster D.ST, the Rock Steady Crew, Rammellzee, the double dutch group Buffalo Girls. The Zulu Nation was centered in suburban Paris since most immigrants lived beyond the city limits. Since 1987, the Zulu Nation&#x27;s ties to the French hip hop community have waned. Since Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s tour of France in 2008 and a Zulu Nation reunion in Paris, new movements of the Universal Zulu Nation have emerged in different cities in France. According to Veronique Henelon, &quot;French rap specifically has been a multi-dimensional expression of ties with Africa.&quot; The first Hip Hop television show reportedly appeared in France. It was called &#x27;H.I.P. H.O.P.&#x27; and was aired by the TF1 channel in 1984.

==In popular culture==
In 2004, the thirteenth episode of the second season of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; had the comedian Dave Chappelle do a sketch on an African-American George W. Bush, called Black Bush, where the character said that his coalition of the willing included Afrika Bambataa and the Zulu Nation.

The Universal Zulu Nation is featured at length in the 2016 Netflix series &quot;The Get Down&quot;. In the series, Afrika Bambaataa is played by Nigerian-American actor Okieriete Onaodowan.

<text>Jay Montgomery Garner (born April 15, 1938) is a retired United States Army lieutenant general who in 2003 was appointed as Director of the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance for Iraq following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, making him the immediate replacement of Saddam Hussein as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state of Iraq. Garner was soon replaced by Ambassador Paul Bremer and the ambassador&#x27;s successor organization to ORHA, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA).

==Early life and education==
Born in Arcadia, Florida, Garner served an enlistment in the United States Marine Corps before attending the Florida State University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in History in 1962. He also holds a master&#x27;s in public administration from Shippensburg State University.

==Military career==

Commissioned as an army second lieutenant in 1962, Garner served two tours in Vietnam, and later led two air defense units in Germany. He also served as deputy commanding general at Fort Bliss, Texas. Garner helped to develop the Patriot missile system and commanded missile batteries during the Gulf War. After the war he was put in charge of securing Kurdish areas in Iraq. He was later named commander of the United States Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (working primarily on President Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative missile shield program), and concluded his army career as Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, retiring in 1997 at the rank of lieutenant general.

After leaving the army, Garner became president of SYColeman, a defense contractor which designs missile communications and targeting systems used in the Patriot and Arrow missile systems. (He has been on unpaid leave from the company since January 2003). Garner served on a presidential panel, chaired by Donald Rumsfeld, which specializes in space and missile threats. He has also worked closely with the Israel Defense Forces.

==Involvement in the Iraq War==
In 2003 Garner was selected to lead the post-war reconstruction efforts in Iraq, along with three deputies, including British Major-General Tim Cross. Garner was regarded as a natural choice by the Bush administration given his earlier similar role in the north. General Garner was to develop and implement plans to assist the Iraqis in developing governance and reconstructing the country once Saddam Hussein was deposed.

Following the defeat of the Saddam Hussein regime in Baghdad, there was widespread looting, rampaging, and general chaos throughout Iraq. Some of the most important monuments, such as the national museum, were under attack. Furthermore, the infrastructure of the country was in ruins, ministries were broken into, and government records were destroyed. The situation in Iraq became chaotic and anarchic. The only ministry which was protected by the occupying forces was the oil ministry. In addition, many exiled leaders from Iran and some from the West returned to Iraq. The Bush administration selected Lieutenant General Jay Garner to lead the Coalition Provisional Authority (an intermediary government) in an attempt to rid Iraq of the chaos and anarchy that consumed the area. Garner&#x27;s plan was to choose government officials from the former Iraqi regime to help lead the country.

Garner began reconstruction efforts in March 2003 with plans aiming for Iraqis to hold elections within 90 days and for the U.S. to quickly pull troops out of the cities to a desert base. Jalal Talabani, a member of Jay Garner&#x27;s staff in Kuwait before the war, was consulted on several occasions to help the U.S. select a liberal Iraqi government; this would be the first liberal government to exist in Iraq. In an interview with Time magazine, Garner stated that &quot;as in any totalitarian regime, there were many people who needed to join the Baath Party in order to get ahead in their careers. We don&#x27;t have a problem with most of them. But we do have a problem with those who were part of the thug mechanism under Saddam. Once the U.S. identifies those in the second group, we will get rid of them.&quot; On April 15, 2003, General Garner called a conference in the city of Nasiriyah, where Garner, along with 100 Iraqis, discussed the future of Iraq. Garner called a follow-up meeting on April 28, 2003. 250 Iraqis attended this meeting, and five of these Iraqis were selected by Garner&#x27;s administration as the core leaders of the new Iraqi government: Masood Barzani was appointed as head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Talabani as head of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Abdul Aziz Al Hakim was appointed as the leader of the Supreme Assembly for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi was chosen to represent the Iraqi National Congress and Iyad Allawi was appointed as the leader of the Iraqi National Accord. Garner&#x27;s selection caused quite a stir amongst many Iraqis. Although many Iraqis were open to the change that Garner and the U.S. were bringing to Iraq, others were resentful. Iraqis with a Shi&#x27;a background felt underrepresented in Garner&#x27;s selection for government. Three of the five officials appointed as key members in Iraq&#x27;s new government were of Sunni background, one official was from a mixed Sunni–Shi&#x27;a background, and only one of the officials was of pure Shi&#x27;a background. The Shi&#x27;a felt left out and underrepresented, considering they comprise over 60% of the Iraqi population. Furthermore, many Iraqis felt this new government was not selected in a democratic manner, as the U.S. had promised. 
Once the leaders were selected, a plan to hold elections in Iraq, where members would be selected, began on May 6, 2003, and ended on November 14, 2003, when the plan was abandoned. General Garner would be replaced by a new American Ambassador to Iraq, Paul Bremer, who took his role as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority. Following Garner&#x27;s dismissal, it was planned that an Iraq government would take power in June 2004. Iyad Allawi was designated to lead the Iraqi interim authority. Allawi was a former Baathist of Shi&#x27;a origin. Allawi had many credentials, including previous work experience with the CIA.

When Garner was replaced in his role by Paul Bremer on May 11, 2003, there was quite a bit of speculation as to why he was replaced so abruptly. It has been suggested that Garner was moved aside because he did not agree with the White House about who should decide how to reconstruct Iraq. He wanted early elections—90 days after the fall of Baghdad—and the new government to decide how to run the country and what to do with its assets. Garner said &quot;I don&#x27;t think [Iraqis] need to go by the U.S. plan, I think that what we need to do is set an Iraqi government that represents the freely elected will of the people. It&#x27;s their country ... their oil.&quot; Some experts faulted Garner for prioritizing elections over improving and privatizing the Iraqi economy.

Garner was interviewed in &quot;No End in Sight&quot;, a 2007 documentary movie very critical of the handling of the Iraq occupation.

<doc id="213788" wikidata="Q1362819" url="?curid=213788" title="Vertebral subluxation">
<text>In chiropractic, a vertebral subluxation means pressure on nerves, abnormal functions creating a lesion in some portion of the body, either in its action or makeup (defined by D.D. Palmer and B.J. Palmer, founders of chiropractic). Chiropractors claim subluxations are not necessarily visible on X-rays.

Straight chiropractors continue to follow Palmer&#x27;s tradition, claiming that vertebral subluxation has considerable health effects and also adding a visceral component to the definition. Most medical experts and some mixer chiropractors consider these ideas to be pseudoscientific and dispute these claims, as there is no scientific evidence for the existence of chiropractic subluxations or proof they or their treatment have any effects on health.

The use of the word &quot;vertebral subluxation&quot; should not be confused with the term&#x27;s precise usage in medicine, which considers only the anatomical relationships.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a &quot;chiropractic subluxation&quot; is a &quot;dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact&quot;. Chiropractic subluxation should not be confused with a medical subluxation, which is a &quot;significant structural displacement&quot; visible on static imaging studies such as X-rays. Chiropractic is a field of alternative treatment outside scientific mainstream medicine, whose practitioners (chiropractors) are not medical doctors.

== History ==

In 1910, D.D. Palmer, the founder of chiropractic, wrote:Nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionating—too much or not enough action—which is dis-ease.In 1909, D.D. Palmer&#x27;s son, B.J. Palmer, incorrectly claimed that chiropractic subluxation caused contagious diseases, writing:Chiropractors have found in every disease that is supposed to be contagious, &quot;a cause in the spine&quot;. In the spinal column we &quot;will&quot; find a subluxation that corresponds to every type of disease. If we had one hundred cases of small-pox, I can prove to you where, in one, you &quot;will&quot; find a subluxation and you will find the &quot;same conditions&quot; in the other ninety-nine. I adjust one and return his functions to normal... . There is no contagious disease... . There is no infection... . There is a cause internal to man that makes of his body in a certain spot, more or less a breeding ground [for microbes]. It is a place where they can multiply, propagate, and then because they become so many they are classed as a cause.

== Clinical practice ==

=== Definitions ===

Chiropractors use and have used various terms to express this concept: subluxation, vertebral subluxation (VS), vertebral subluxation complex (VSC), &quot;killer subluxations&quot;, and the &quot;silent killer&quot;.

Chiropractors along with some physical therapists and osteopathic physicians, have also used another term, BOOP, meaning &quot;bone out of place&quot;.

The WHO definition of the chiropractic vertebral subluxation is:A lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity.The purported displacement is not necessarily visible on static imaging studies, such as X-rays. This is in contrast to the medical definition of spinal subluxation which, according to the WHO, is a &quot;significant structural displacement&quot;, and therefore visible on X-rays.

As of 2014, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners states:

: The specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the chiropractic subluxation or joint dysfunction. A subluxation is a health concern that manifests in the skeletal joints, and, through complex anatomical and physiological relationships, affects the nervous system and may lead to reduced function, disability or illness.

In 1996 an official consensus definition of subluxation was formed. Cooperstein and Gleberzon have described the situation: &quot;... although many in the chiropractic profession reject the concept of &quot;subluxation&quot; and shun the use of this term as a diagnosis, the presidents of at least a dozen chiropractic colleges of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) developed a consensus definition of &quot;subluxation&quot; in 1996. It reads:

: Chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention on the subluxation. A subluxation is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health. A subluxation is evaluated, diagnosed, and managed through the use of chiropractic procedures based on the best available rational and empirical evidence.

In 2001 the World Federation of Chiropractic, representing the national chiropractic associations in 77 countries, adopted this consensus statement which reaffirms belief in the vertebral subluxation.

The ACC paradigm has been criticized by chiropractic authors:All in all, the ambiguities that permeate the ACC&#x27;s statements on subluxation render it inadequate as a guide to clinical research... Whether the ACC&#x27;s subluxation claims have succeeded as a political statement is beyond our concern here. These assertions were published as a priori truths (what many chiropractors have traditionally referred to as &quot;principle&quot;), and are exemplary of scientifically unjustified assertions made in many corners of the profession. It matters not whether unsubstantiated assertions are offered for clinical, political, scientific, educational, marketing or other purposes; when offered without acknowledgment of their tentative character, they amount to dogmatism. We contend that attempts to foster unity (among the schools or in the wider profession) at the expense of scientific integrity is ultimately self-defeating. To be sure, the profession&#x27;s lack of cultural authority is based in part upon our characteristic disunity. However, attempts to generate unity by adoption of a common dogma can only bring scorn and continued alienation from the wider health care community and the public we all serve.In May 2010 the General Chiropractic Council, the statutory regulatory body for chiropractors in the United Kingdom, issued guidance for chiropractors stating that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex &quot;is an historical concept&quot; and &quot;is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease or health concerns.&quot;

The chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex has been a source of controversy since its inception in 1895 due to the lack of empirical evidence for its existence, its metaphysical origins, and claims of its far reaching effects on health and disease. Although some chiropractic associations and colleges support the concept of subluxation, many in the chiropractic profession reject it and shun the use of this term as a diagnosis. In the United States and in Canada the term &quot;nonallopathic lesion&quot; may be used in place of &quot;subluxation&quot;.
Other chiropractors consider subluxation as more of an abstract concept rather than a medical condition. Tedd Koren says,

=== International Classification of Diseases coding ===

The differences between a medical subluxation and a chiropractic &quot;vertebral subluxation&quot; create confusion and difficulties when it comes to following official ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding. In a 2014 article in &quot;Dynamic Chiropractic&quot; by a chiropractor who is a certified professional coder, these difficulties were discussed in detail. He noted that the WHO recognizes the differences between the two types of &quot;subluxations&quot;, and also pointed out certain difficulties for chiropractors:...the official definition of 739 codes is &quot;nonallopathic lesions, not elsewhere classified... In other words, 739 is a code that does not describe a subluxation. It does not even say what the patient has; it says that there is no code to describe what the patient has... [T]he elusive &quot;vertebral subluxation complex&quot; I learned about in school has no place in the ICD-9 code set. All we get is 739, which is a code for conditions that do not have a code.

ICD-9 has never provided a code that truly describes this and differentiates between the chiropractic subluxation and the allopathic subluxation. Chiropractors have been compelled to try to fit a square peg into a round hole for many years.At the time of writing (August 2014) it was still uncertain which codes in the newer ICD-10 would be useful for chiropractors and how they would be interpreted.

=== Components ===

Traditionally there have been five components that form the chiropractic subluxation.

# Spinal Kinesiopathology
# Neuropathophysiology/Neuropathology
# Myopathology
# Histopathology
# Biochemical changes

=== Diagnosis ===

Historically, the detection of spinal misalignment (subluxations) by the chiropractic profession has relied on X-ray findings and physical examination. At least two of the following four physical signs and/or symptoms must be documented to qualify for reimbursement :
* Pain and tenderness
* Asymmetry/misalignment
* Range of motion abnormality
* Tissue/tone changes

===Rationale===
It has been proposed that a vertebral subluxation can negatively affect general health by altering the neurological communication between the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. Although individuals may not always be symptomatic, straight chiropractors believe that the presence of vertebral subluxation is in itself justification for correction via spinal adjustment.

V. Strang, D.C., describes several hypotheses on how a misaligned vertebra may cause interference to the nervous system in his book, &quot;Essential Principles of Chiropractic&quot;:
* Nerve compression hypothesis: suggests that when the vertebrae are out of alignment, the nerve roots and/or spinal cord can become pinched or irritated. While the most commonly referenced hypothesis, and easiest for a patient to understand, it may be the least likely to occur.
* Proprioceptive insult hypothesis: focuses on articular alterations causing hyperactivity of the sensory nerve fibers.
* Somatosympathetic reflex hypothesis: all the visceral organ functions can be reflexly affected by cutaneous or muscular stimulation.
* Somatosomatic reflex hypothesis: afferent impulses from one part of the body can result in reflex activity in other parts of the body.
* Viscerosomatic reflex hypothesis: visceral afferent fibers cause reflex somatic problems.
* Somatopsychic hypothesis: the effects of a subluxation on the ascending paths of the reticular activating system.
* Neurodystrophic hypothesis: focuses on lowered tissue resistance that results from abnormal innervation.
* Dentate ligament-cord distortion hypothesis: upper cervical misalignment can cause the dentate ligaments to put a stress on the spinal cord.
* Psychogenic hypothesis: emotions, such as stress, causing contraction in skeletal muscles.

The vertebral subluxation has been described as a syndrome with signs and symptoms which include: altered alignment; aberrant motion; palpable soft tissue changes; localized/referred pain; muscle contraction or imbalance; altered physiological function; reversible with adjustment/manipulation; focal tenderness.

===Procedure===

Chiropractic treatment of vertebral subluxation focuses on delivering a chiropractic adjustment which is a high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust to the dysfunctional spinal segments to help correct the chiropractic subluxation complex. Spinal adjustment is the primary procedure used by chiropractors in the adjustment.

===Disagreement amongst practitioners===

The chiropractic subluxation is the heart of the split between &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;mixer&quot; chiropractors. Straight chiropractors continue to follow Palmer&#x27;s vitalistic tradition, claiming that subluxation has considerable health effects and also adding a visceral component to the definition, while mixers, as exemplified by the United Kingdom&#x27;s General Chiropractic Council, consider it a historical concept with no evidence identifying it as the cause of disease.

Some chiropractors have described the disagreements within the profession about the concept, and have written skeptically about BOOP as an antiquated idea. In 1992 one wrote:The main problem we often run into is the bone out of place (BOOP) concept. It seems we somehow step on toes when we describe the spine as a functioning entity instead of a stack of bones that can be shifted back and forth into the ideal configuration. The BOOP concept will eventually fade, and we are grateful for its contribution to chiropractic. For many decades, it offered a model to work from. This model has been updated by the rest of the healing profession, but chiropractors have been hesitant to let this antiquated model go. Some within our profession hold onto this model with a religious fervor. The chiropractic profession has moved into a new age. The BOOP concept has been updated and science is ever upon us in the 90s. Let&#x27;s start asking questions again and drive the chiropractic profession kicking and screaming into the 21st century.Chiropractor David Seaman wrote in 1994 about the &quot;brutal civil war&quot;:According to various gossip columnists in chiropractic, our profession appears to be currently enmeshed in a brutal civil war between BOOP (bone-out-of-place) practitioners and low back pain practitioners. It should be known that the BOOPers incorrectly call themselves subluxation-based practitioners. My experience has demonstrated that the BOOPers do not know enough about subluxation to call themselves subluxation-based chiropractors. We would all do well to not be subluxation-based in the BOOP sense. It should also be known that this so-called war is really an over-dramatized skirmish between vocal BOOPers and a theoretical group of anti-chiropractic DCs. I have yet to meet any of these anti-chiropractic DCs. Unfortunately, the BOOPers seem to think that those who do not embrace the totality of BOOP philosophy are merely non-BOOPers who are still very pro-chiropractic and appreciate the philosophy of chiropractic from a contemporary and nondogmatic perspective.In an article written in 2004, Seaman openly disparaged the idea still propounded by &quot;modern-day advocates of this concept&quot;:... it is essentially impossible to have nerve interference. To summarize, nerve interference is described, by modern-day advocates of this concept, as a reduction of neural or mental impulses, which occurs in response to a bone-out-of-place (BOOP) subluxation... Clearly, the BOOP subluxation model fails miserably when considered in the light of basic neuroscience facts... BOOP subluxationists become angry and defensive when the BOOP model of subluxation is criticized... The reactionary nature of certain BOOP subluxationists is to accuse those who don&#x27;t buy into the BOOP model of being anti-chiropractic—an astonishing leap of ignorance, to say the least. Furthermore, anyone who does not buy into the model is trying to &quot;medicalize chiropractic&quot;—another example of low-IQ thinking. And if tears do not well up in your eyes when you hear the phrase, &quot;The power that made the body, heals the body,&quot; you are accused of having no passion for chiropractic—still another example of depressed, frontal-lobe activity. Even worse, if you don&#x27;t buy into every bizarre, New Age, tree-hugging notion that comes down the pike and is circularly attached to subluxation, you will be accused of being an atheist—an excellent example of the need for psychiatrists and the drugs they prescribe.

== Evidence of condition ==

Believers within the chiropractic tradition assert that spinal health and function are directly related to general health and well-being, including visceral disorders, but the efficacy and validity of spinal manipulation to address visceral disorders systems remains a source of controversy within the chiropractic profession. The usefulness of spinal manipulation for organic disorders is not supported by evidence. Chiropractic professors and researchers, Nansel and Szlazak, found that:the proper differential diagnosis of somatic (musculoskeletal) vs. visceral (organ) dysfunction represents a challenge for both the medical and chiropractic physician. The afferent convergence mechanisms, which can create signs and symptoms that are virtually indistinguishable with respect to their somatic vs. visceral etiologies, suggest it is not unreasonable that this somatic visceral-disease mimicry could very well account for the &quot;cures&quot; of presumed organ disease that have been observed over the years in response to various somatic therapies (e.g., spinal manipulation, acupuncture, Rolfing, Qi Gong, etc.) and may represent a common phenomenon that has led to &quot;holistic&quot; health care claims on the part of such clinical disciplines.

Considering this phenomenon, Seaman suggests that the chiropractic concept of joint complex (somatic) dysfunction should be incorporated into the differential diagnosis of pain and visceral symptoms because these dysfunctions often generate symptoms similar to those produced by true visceral disease and says that this mimicry leads to unnecessary surgical procedures and medications.

Other chiropractic researchers have also questioned some of the claimed effects of vertebral subluxation:

The literature supports the existence of somatovisceral and viscerosomatic reflexes, but there is little or no evidence to support the notion that the spinal derangements (often referred to as subluxations by chiropractors) can cause prolonged aberrant discharge of these reflexes. Equally unsupported in the literature is the notion that the prolonged activation of these reflexes will manifest into pathological state of tissues, and most relevantly, that the application of spinal manipulative therapy can alter the prolonged reflex discharge or be associated with a reversal of the pathological degeneration of the affected reflexes or tissues. The evidence that has been amassed is largely anecdotal or case report based and it has attracted much intra disciplinary debate because of its frequent association with certain approaches to management (largely described as being traditional or &quot;philosophical&quot; in nature).

Still other chiropractic researchers stated quite directly:

... early chiropractic philosophy ... considered disease the result of spinal nerve dysfunction caused by misplaced (subluxated) vertebrae. Although rejected by medical science, this concept is still [2000] accepted by a minority of chiropractors. ... Indeed, many progressive chiropractors have rejected the historical concept of the chiropractic subluxation in favor of ones that more accurately describe the nature of the complex joint disfunctions they treat.

Professor Philip S. Bolton of the School of Biomedical Sciences at University of Newcastle, Australia writes in &quot;Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics&quot;, &quot;The traditional chiropractic vertebral subluxation hypothesis proposes that vertebral misalignment cause illness, disease, or both. This hypothesis remains controversial.&quot; His objective was, &quot;To briefly review and update experimental evidence concerning reflex effects of vertebral subluxations, particularly concerning peripheral nervous system responses to vertebral subluxations. Data source: Information was obtained from chiropractic or, scientific peer-reviewed literature concerning human or animal studies of neural responses to vertebral subluxation, vertebral displacement or movement, or both.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Animal models suggest that vertebral displacements and putative vertebral subluxations may modulate activity in group I to IV afferent nerves. However, it is not clear whether these afferent nerves are modulated during normal day-to-day activities of living and, if so, what segmental or whole-body reflex effects they may have.&quot;

Edzard Ernst has stated that the &quot;core concepts of chiropractic, subluxation and spinal manipulation, are not based on sound science.&quot;

An area of debate among chiropractors is whether &quot;vertebral subluxation&quot; is a metaphysical concept (as posited in B. J. Palmer&#x27;s philosophy of chiropractic) or a real phenomenon. In an article on vertebral subluxation, the chiropractic authors wrote:
Other chiropractors have declared its unproven status as an area that needs reform:

A Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center article describes the mainstream understanding of vertebral subluxation theory:
In 2009, four scholarly chiropractors concluded that epidemiologic evidence does not support chiropractic&#x27;s most fundamental theory. Since its inception, the vast majority of chiropractors have postulated that &quot;subluxations&quot; (misalignments) are the cause or underlying cause of ill health and can be corrected with spinal &quot;adjustments&quot;. After searching the scientific literature, the chiropractic authors concluded:

In 2005, four leading chiropractic researchers leveled strong critiques of chiropractic dogma:

In 2015, internationally accredited chiropractic colleges from Bournemouth University, University of South Wales, University of Southern Denmark, University of Zürich, Institut Franco-Européen de Chiropraxie, and University of Johannesburg made an open statement which included: &quot;The teaching of the vertebral subluxation complex as a vitalistic construct that claims that it is the cause of disease is unsupported by evidence. Its inclusion in a modern chiropractic curriculum in anything other than an historic context is therefore inappropriate and unnecessary.&quot;

<doc id="213792" wikidata="Q1567156" url="?curid=213792" title="Hale Boggs">
<text>Thomas Hale Boggs Sr. (February 15, 1914 – disappeared October 16, 1972; declared dead December 29, 1972) was an American Democratic Party politician and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Orleans, Louisiana. He was the House majority leader and a member of the Warren Commission.

In 1972, while still majority leader, Boggs was on a fundraising drive in Alaska when the twin engine airplane on which he was travelling along with Alaska congressman Nick Begich and two others disappeared en route from Anchorage to Juneau, Alaska.

==Early life and education==
Boggs was born in Long Beach in Harrison County on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, the son of Claire Josephine (Hale) and William Robertson &quot;Will&quot; Boggs. Boggs was educated at Tulane University where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1934 and a law degree in 1937. He first practiced law in New Orleans but soon became a leader in the movement to break the power of the political machine of U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long Jr., who was assassinated in 1935. Long had previously broken the power of New Orleans politicians in 1929.

== Career ==

=== U.S. House ===
A Democrat running as an anti-Long candidate in the 2nd congressional district, Boggs defeated incumbent Paul H. Maloney in the 1940 Democratic primary and won the general election unopposed. When he was sworn in he was, at 27, the youngest member of Congress.

His initial election was not without controversy; five of his political allies who served as Orleans Parish election commissioners were convicted of changing 97 votes for Boggs&#x27;s Democratic primary opponents into votes for Boggs. The case, &quot;United States v. Classic&quot;, reached the Supreme Court, where it established the federal government&#x27;s authority to regulate local primary elections, setting a key precedent for later civil rights decisions.

After an unsuccessful bid for renomination in 1942 against his predecessor Paul Maloney, Boggs joined the United States Navy as an ensign. He served the remainder of World War II.

===Gubernatorial bid===

After the war, Boggs began his political comeback. He was again elected to Congress in 1946 (on Maloney&#x27;s retirement) and was then re-elected thirteen times, once just after he disappeared, but before he was presumed dead. In 1951, Boggs launched an ill-fated campaign for governor of Louisiana. Leading in the polls early in the campaign, he was soon put on the defensive when another candidate, Lucille May Grace, at the urging of long-time southeastern Louisiana political boss Leander Perez, questioned Boggs&#x27;s membership in the American Student Union in the 1930s. By 1951, the ASU was thought to be a Communist front. Boggs avoided the question and attacked both Grace and Perez for conducting a smear campaign against him. In his book, &quot;The Big Lie&quot;, author Garry Boulard suggests strongly that Boggs was a member of the ASU but tried to cover up that fact in the different political climate of the early 1950s.

The Boggs Act of 1952, sponsored by Hale Boggs, set harsh mandatory sentences for drug-related offenses. A first-offense conviction for marijuana possession carried a minimum sentence of 2 to 10 years with a fine of up to $20,000.

===Later House elections===
During his tenure in Congress, Boggs was an influential member. After the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision, he signed the 1956 Southern Manifesto condemning desegregation. Boggs voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960 and 1964, but voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He was instrumental in passage of the interstate highway program in 1956.

Boggs was the youngest member of the Warren Commission, which, from 1963 to 1964, investigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Boggs has been reported to have differing positions regarding the Warren report. Based upon Office of the House Historian and Clerk of the House Office of Art and Archives, Politico reports that &quot;Boggs dissented from the commission&#x27;s majority report which supported the single bullet thesis — pointing to a lone assassin. Boggs said he &quot;had strong doubts about it&quot;. But in a 1966 appearance on &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Boggs defended the commission&#x27;s findings and stated that he did not doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy. He said that all the evidence indicated that Kennedy was shot from behind and that the argument that one bullet hit both Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally was &quot;very persuasive&quot;. Boggs took issue with the assertions of Warren Commission critics and stated that it was &quot;human nature&quot; that &quot;many people would prefer to believe there was a conspiracy&quot;. Boggs&#x27; son, Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., later stated that his father had shown him dossiers compiled by the FBI on Warren Commission critics in order to discredit them. It is unknown why his position was stated in such opposite terms, but conspiracy theorists have pondered that difference as significant. In Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot;, it is Sen. Russell Long who prompts Jim Garrison (the District Attorney of Orleans Parish) to reopen his investigation into Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s activities in New Orleans during the summer of 1963 (beginning with Oswald&#x27;s association with David W. Ferrie and Guy Bannister). According to author Joan Mellen in her book &quot;A Farewell to Justice&quot;, Jim Garrison told her it was actually Boggs that prompted him to reopen his investigation into the assassination of the President.

In the 1979 novel &quot;The Matarese Circle&quot;, author Robert Ludlum portrayed Boggs as having been killed to stop his probe into the assassination.

Boggs served as Majority Whip from 1962 to 1971 and as Majority Leader from January 1971 up until the time of his disappearance. As the Whip, he ushered much of President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society legislation through Congress. In late 1966, Boggs was asked to help the AFL-NFL merger by having the merged league receive an exemption from antitrust-law sanctions. He helped get the merger attached to a bill that would get to a vote (as assisted by state senator Russell Long), which resulted in both a successful merger and a professional football team in Louisiana, which soon became known as the New Orleans Saints.

On August 22, 1968, while Secretary of State Dean Rusk was testifying in a hearing concerning the Vietnam War, Boggs interrupted the session to announce the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the troops of the Soviet Union, after hearing of a recent Radio Prague broadcast telling the Czechoslovaks not to take any action against the occupying forces. That caused Secretary Rusk, who was previously unaware of the situation, to excuse himself immediately, mid-testimony, to attend to the issue of the invasion. (Source: Walter Cronkite: &quot;The Way It Was: The 1960s&quot;)

On 5 April 1971, he made a speech on the floor of the House in which he strongly attacked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover and the whole of the FBI. He stated that the FBI had him under surveillance and that they were violating the Bill of Rights. He added that numerous members of Congress had expressed their belief to him in private that the FBI was monitoring their phone conversations and criticized the FBI for placing agents on college campuses in order to infiltrate certain organizations. Boggs demanded the resignation of Hoover and accused the FBI of utilizing &quot;the tactics of the Soviet Union and Hitler’s Gestapo&quot;. This speech shocked many, including his own staff and fellow Congress members.

That led to a conversation on April 6, 1971 between President Richard M. Nixon and the Republican minority leader, Gerald Ford. Nixon said that he could no longer take counsel from Boggs as a senior member of Congress. In the recording of this call, Nixon asked Ford to arrange for the House delegation to include an alternative to Boggs. Ford speculated that Boggs was either drinking too much or taking pills that were upsetting him mentally.

On April 22, 1971, Boggs went even further:
&quot;Over the postwar years, we have granted to the elite and secret police within our system vast new powers over the lives and liberties of the people. At the request of the trusted and respected heads of those forces, and their appeal to the necessities of national security, we have exempted those grants of power from due accounting and strict surveillance.&quot;

==Disappearance in Alaska==
As majority leader, Boggs often campaigned for others, including Representative Nick Begich of Alaska. On October 16, 1972, Boggs was aboard a twin-engine Cessna 310 with Representative Begich, who was facing a possible tight race in the November 1972 general election against the Republican candidate, Don Young, when it disappeared during a flight from Anchorage to Juneau. Also on board were Begich&#x27;s aide, Russell Brown, and pilot Don Jonz; the four were heading to a campaign fundraiser for Begich.

The search for the missing aircraft and four men included the U.S. Coast Guard, Navy, Army, Air Force, Civil Air Patrol and civilian fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.

An emergency position-indicating emergency locator transmitter (ELT) was not required at this time. This accident influenced the adoption of the ELT requirement in 1973.

No emergency-transmission signal determined to be from the plane was heard during the search. In its report on the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board stated that the pilot&#x27;s portable emergency transmitter, permissible in lieu of a fixed transmitter on the plane, was found in an aircraft at Fairbanks. The report also notes that a witness saw an unidentified object in the pilot&#x27;s briefcase that resembled, except for color, the portable emergency transmitter. The safety board concluded that neither the pilot nor aircraft had an emergency location transmitter.

On November 24, 1972, the search was suspended after 39 days. Neither the wreckage of the plane nor the pilot&#x27;s and passengers&#x27; remains were ever found. After a hearing and seven-minute jury deliberation, his death certificate was signed by Judge Dorothy Tyner.

After Boggs and Begich were re-elected posthumously that November, House Resolution 1 of January 3, 1973, officially recognized Boggs&#x27;s presumed death and opened the way for a special election. The same was done for Begich.

In summer 2020, Boggs&#x27;s disappearance was investigated in a podcast produced by iHeartMedia called &quot;Missing in Alaska&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Boggs&#x27;s wife since 1938, Lindy, was elected as a Democrat to the 93rd Congress, by special election, to the second district seat left vacant by her husband&#x27;s death. She was reelected to the eight succeeding Congresses (March 20, 1973 – January 3, 1991) and retired after the 1990 election. In 1997, President Bill Clinton appointed Lindy Boggs U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, in which capacity she served until 2001.

Hale and Lindy Boggs had four children: Cokie Roberts, who was a U.S. TV and public-radio journalist and the wife of journalist Steven V. Roberts, Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., who was a Washington, D.C.–based lawyer and lobbyist, Barbara Boggs Sigmund, who served as mayor of Princeton, New Jersey, and William Robertson Boggs, who died as an infant on December 28, 1946. In 1982, Sigmund lost a bid for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate to Frank Lautenberg.

Boggs was a practicing Roman Catholic.

==Tributes==
The Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge, which spans the Mississippi River in St. Charles Parish, is named in memory of the former congressman. The visitor center at Portage Glacier in Southcentral Alaska (located within Chugach National Forest) is named the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center. Boggs Peak which is four miles north of the visitor center is also named for him. The Hale Boggs Federal Complex, at 500 Poydras Street in New Orleans, is also named after him.

In 1993, Boggs was among 13 politicians, past and present, inducted into the first class of the new Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

<text>Patricia Susan Summitt (; June 14, 1952 – June 28, 2016) was an American women&#x27;s college basketball head coach and college basketball player. As a coach, she acquired 1,098 career wins, the most in college basketball history at the time of her retirement. She served as the head coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team from 1974 to 2012 and is considered one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time. 

Summitt won a silver medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal as a member of the United States women&#x27;s national basketball team. She returned to the Olympics in 1984 as a head coach, guiding the U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team to a gold medal. Summitt won eight NCAA Division I basketball championships. In 38 years as coach of the Tennessee Lady Volunteers, she never missed the NCAA Tournament nor did she ever have a losing season. Summitt retired from coaching at age 59 following a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Summitt was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999 as a member of its inaugural class. She was named the Naismith Basketball Coach of the Century in 2000. In 2009, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; placed her at number 11 on its list of the 50 Greatest Coaches of All Time in all sports; she was the only woman on the list. In 2012, Summitt was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama and received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2012 ESPY Awards. In 2013, she was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.

==Early life and family==
Summitt was born Patricia Sue Head on June 14, 1952, in Clarksville, Tennessee, to Richard and Hazel Albright Head. In her early years, she was known as Trish. She had four siblings: older brothers Tommy, Charles, and Kenneth, and a younger sister, Linda. Summitt grew up on a dairy farm and began playing basketball when she was six years old, on a hoop her father had installed in a barn.

When Summitt was in high school, her family moved to nearby Henrietta so she could play basketball in Cheatham County, because Clarksville did not have a girls team. From there, Summitt went to the University of Tennessee at Martin, where she won All-American honors playing for UT–Martin&#x27;s first women&#x27;s basketball coach, Nadine Gearin. In 1970, with the passage of Title IX still two years away, there were no athletic scholarships for women. Each of Summitt&#x27;s brothers had received athletic scholarships, but her parents paid her way to college. She later co-captained the United States women&#x27;s national basketball team as a player at the inaugural women&#x27;s tournament in the 1976 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal. Eight years later in 1984, she coached the U.S. women&#x27;s team to an Olympic gold medal, becoming the first U.S. Olympian to win a basketball medal and coach a medal-winning team.

==Coaching career==

===1970s===
Just before the 1974–75 season, with women&#x27;s college basketball still in its infancy and not yet an NCAA-sanctioned sport, 22-year-old Summitt became a graduate assistant at the University of Tennessee, and was named head coach of the Lady Vols after the previous coach suddenly quit. Summitt earned $250 monthly and washed the players&#x27; uniforms – uniforms purchased the previous year with proceeds from a doughnut sale. Summitt recalled that era of women&#x27;s basketball during a February 2009 interview with &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;I had to drive the van when I first started coaching,&quot; Summitt said. &quot;One time, for a road game, we actually slept in the other team&#x27;s gym the night before. We had mats, we had our little sleeping bags. When I was a player at the University of Tennessee at Martin, we played at Tennessee Tech for three straight games, and we didn&#x27;t wash our uniforms. We only had one set. We played because we loved the game. We didn&#x27;t think anything about it.&quot;

During Summitt&#x27;s first year as head coach, four of her players were only a year younger than she was and all were from Tennessee high schools, which until 1980 employed a six-person game where offensive and defensive players never crossed mid-court. She coached her first game for Tennessee on December 7, 1974, against Mercer University in Macon, Georgia; the Lady Vols lost 84–83. Her first win came almost a month later when the Lady Vols defeated Middle Tennessee State, 69–32 on January 10, 1975. The Lady Vols won the Tennessee College Women&#x27;s Sports Federation (TCWSF) Eastern District Championship for the third straight year. However, the team finished 4th overall in the TCWSF (they had been second the previous two years), and were not invited to the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) tournament.

In her second season, Summitt coached the Lady Vols to a 16–11 record while earning her 1976 master&#x27;s degree in physical education and training as the co-captain of the 1976 U.S. Women&#x27;s Olympic basketball team that won a silver medal in Montreal. Starting with the 1976–77 season, Summitt directed two 20-win teams, winning back-to-back AIAW Region II championships. The Lady Vols defeated 3-time AIAW champion Delta State by 20 points in 1978, and earned Tennessee its first number one ranking. 1978 saw the Lady Vols participate in their first AIAW Final Four, where they finished third. Summitt also recorded her 100th win during this season, a 79–66 victory over NC State. Tennessee closed the 1970s by winning the first-ever SEC tournament, and returning to the AIAW Final Four, where they finished runner-up to Old Dominion, 68–53.

===1980s===
During the 1980–81 season, the Lady Vols went 25–6, and avenged their championship game loss to Old Dominion by defeating them three times. The team made it to the AIAW Final Four for the third straight year; finished runner-up for the second consecutive year, losing to Louisiana Tech, 79–59.

The 1981–82 season featured the first ever NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The Lady Vols were one of 32 teams invited and named a 2 seed in their region. In the region championship, the Lady Vols upset top-seeded USC 91–90 in overtime to advance to the Final Four. They lost their Final Four match-up with Louisiana Tech, which went on to win the tournament.

The next season, the Lady Vols won the regular season SEC title but fell in the SEC tournament to Georgia. Tennessee was invited to the now-36 team NCAA tournament and awarded its first-ever 1 seed. Tennessee made it to the regional championship, but fell to Georgia again, 67–63. Summitt won her 200th game on December 3, a 69–56 victory over St. John&#x27;s during the Coca-Cola Classic in Detroit.

The 1983–84 season saw Tennessee start out 6–4. However, Summitt rallied her team and finished 22–10, for her eighth straight 20-win season. Tennessee not only made it to the NCAA Final Four for the second time in the first three tournaments, but also made it to the title game. However, Tennessee lost by 11 to USC, which also had won the title the previous year. Summit earned Coach of the Year honors. The 1983–84 season was followed up by another 20-win year in which Tennessee earned both the regular season SEC title (despite only going 4–4) and the tournament title. However, the Lady Vols fell in the NCAA tournament to Ole Miss during the round of 16.
The next season was a similar story – the Lady Vols had a good regular season, played a great tournament (reaching the Final Four for the second time in three years), but fell before winning the title.

In 1986–87, Tennessee broke through and defeated perennial power Louisiana Tech 67–44 to win the Lady Vols&#x27; first national title. Tennessee&#x27;s Tonya Edwards was named the Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four. During the regular season, Summitt also earned her 300th win, an 87–66 victory over North Carolina. The next year in 1987–88, the Lady Vols were positioned to repeat, as Tennessee made it to the Final Four yet again. However, Louisiana Tech avenged the previous year&#x27;s championship game loss with a 9-point victory and went on to win the title.

In 1988–89, the Lady Vols reached the Final Four for the fourth straight year. After eliminating Maryland by 12 points, Tennessee faced SEC rival Auburn for the national title. Auburn had lost by two points to Louisiana Tech in the NCAA title game the previous year and had suffered its only loss in the SEC Championship game by 15 points to Tennessee. The championship game was similar as Tennessee took home its second title in three years with a 76–60 victory. It was Tennessee&#x27;s best season yet; the Lady Vols won 35 games while losing only two regular season contests to Auburn and Texas. The Lady Vols won every NCAA tournament game by at least 12 points.

In 1989–90, the Lady Vols started off the season well, winning the SEC title. However, the team fell by 1 point to Auburn in the SEC Championship Game and lost in overtime to Virginia in the regional finals, one game shy of making a trip to the Final Four, which that year was held in Knoxville. Summitt accomplished another milestone that season with her 400th win, a 70–69 victory over South Carolina on January 25.

===1990s===
Tennessee failed to win the SEC regular season or the tournament championship in 1990–91, but after a close win in the NCAA regional semifinals against Western Kentucky, the Lady Vols eliminated Auburn for the second time in three years. In the national semifinals, the Lady Vols beat Stanford, 68–60, to earn the chance to avenge the previous year&#x27;s tournament loss against Virginia. Just as the previous year&#x27;s game had gone into overtime, so did this one. Tennessee escaped with a 70–67 win and its third national title in five years. The next season in 1991–92, the Lady Vols did not make it to the regional championship, falling 75–70 to the same Western Kentucky team they had beaten in that round the previous year. In 1992–93, Tennessee defeated the defending champions Stanford twice and swept the SEC season for the first time. However, the Lady Vols were unable to win the SEC tournament title and fell 72–56 in the NCAA tournament to Iowa in the regional finals.

Early in the 1993–94 season, Summitt grabbed her 500th win, an 80–45 win over Ohio State on November 21. Tennessee went on to win the regular season and tournament SEC titles before falling 71–68 to Louisiana Tech in the regional semifinals. The next season marked Tennessee&#x27;s return to the Final Four. Tennessee went undefeated in the SEC regular season for the third straight year, but failed to win the tournament title. The top-seeded Lady Vols breezed their way to a fifth national title game, with no other tournament game being closer than 21 points. However, in the national championship game, the Lady Vols fell 70–64 to the undefeated UConn Huskies, coached by Summit&#x27;s rival, Geno Auriemma, in the first of eleven championships for UConn. During the off-season, Summitt recruited high school stand-out Chamique Holdsclaw.

In 1995–96, with freshman Holdsclaw and senior Michelle M. Marciniak, the Lady Vols won the SEC tournament and made a second straight Final Four trip. In the semifinals, the Lady Vols avenged the previous year&#x27;s tournament loss to UConn by ousting Auriemma and the Huskies with a hard-fought 5-point win in overtime. The championship game was not that close as Tennessee easily won its fourth title with an 83–65 win over Georgia.

The 1996–97 Lady Vols posted one of the worst records ever for a Summitt-coached team. In addition to losses to powerhouses such as Louisiana Tech (twice), Stanford, Old Dominion, and Connecticut, Tennessee fell to teams such as Florida, against whom they had been previously undefeated. Summitt earned her 600th win with a 15-point victory over Marquette on November 23, 1996. Summitt and the 1996–97 championship team were the subject of an HBO documentary titled &quot;A Cinderella Season: The Lady Vols Fight Back&quot;. The Lady Vols posted a 23–10 record heading into the NCAA tournament. However, Tennessee righted itself during the tournament, shocking previously undefeated Connecticut in the regional final before defeating Notre Dame and Old Dominion in the Final Four to win the team&#x27;s second straight national championship.
In many aspects, the 1997–98 team was Summitt&#x27;s best. With the top-ranked recruiting class as well as Chamique Holdsclaw, the Lady Vols ran the table to a 39–0 season while playing one of the top-ranked schedules in the country. Only three teams came within 10 points of beating the team, and the Lady Vols won a 93–75 victory over Louisiana Tech for their third straight national championship. After the championship game, opposing Louisiana Tech head coach Leon Balmore proclaimed the Tennessee team to be the &quot;best ever&quot;, echoing a similar claim made by Old Dominion University Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman.

Holdsclaw (who by then had won national championships every season she was with the Vols) predicted that the 1998–99 team would be the greatest ever. However, Tennessee didn&#x27;t claim another national title or make it to the Final Four. Injuries to several players decimated the team and the Lady Vols ultimately fell to Duke in the regional finals. A landmark was set during this season however, as Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings, and Semeka Randall became the first trio from one team to be named Kodak All-Americans.

The Lady Vols ended the decade with a third straight 30-win season, third straight SEC title, and third straight SEC Tournament title. Additionally, they defeated UConn in the regular season, 72–71, in UConn&#x27;s only loss of the year. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee breezed its way to the title game, winning all five games by at least 10 points. In the championship game the Lady Vols were beaten soundly by UConn, 71–52. This marked the fourth time in six years that either Tennessee or UConn had eliminated the other from the tournament. UConn&#x27;s two wins in that period came in championship games, adding more intensity to the Summit-Auriemma rivalry. During the season, Summitt earned her 700th win, 85–62 at Wisconsin.

At the 2000 ESPY awards, the Lady Vols basketball team was named co-team of the decade, along with the Florida State Seminoles football team. Additionally, Summitt was named the Naismith Coach of the Century and Chamique Holdsclaw earned recognition as Naismith Women&#x27;s Collegiate Player of the Century.

===2000s===
In the 2000–01 season, the Lady Vols claimed another SEC title, winning all 14 SEC games. Additionally, they split the season series with the UConn Huskies and headed into the SEC tournament with a 28–1 record. However, the Lady Vols were upset by Vanderbilt in the semifinals and then lost in the Sweet Sixteen to Xavier, their worst finish since 1993–94. During the regular season, Summitt earned her 750th win in the second game against UConn, a 92–88 victory. The team also finished with its fourth straight 30-win season.

In the 2001–02 season, the Lady Vols won their fifth straight SEC championship, but fell again in the conference tournament, this time to LSU. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee reached the Final Four again, with a 5-point win over Vanderbilt University. This trip to the Final Four marked Summitt&#x27;s 13th appearance, which broke Coach John Wooden&#x27;s record of 12, and earned her 788th win, which tied Summitt with Jody Conradt for the winningest coach in women&#x27;s basketball history. However, the Lady Vols fell in the national semifinals to Connecticut, which wound up winning the championship and capping an undefeated season. This loss ended the season at 29–5, one win shy of extending Summitt&#x27;s streak of 30-win seasons. Summitt did achieve more milestones during the season; a 106–66 win over USC marked Summitt&#x27;s 200th win at home, a victory against Louisiana Tech was her 300th win against a ranked opponent and her 93–65 win over Arkansas was her 1,000th game as a coach, including international contests.

During the 2002–03 season, the Lady Vols compiled their sixth perfect SEC season and beat powerhouses Duke and Louisiana Tech, among others, during the regular season, but lost to Texas and UConn. In the NCAA tournament, the Lady Vols made it to the title game only to lose to the Huskies again 73–68. During the season, Summitt earned her 800th win, 76–57 over DePaul and was the fastest coach to reach this milestone.

The 2003–04 season was similar to the previous year. The Lady Vols defeated most of their regular season opponents, including Duke and Louisiana Tech, but dropped games to UConn and Texas. The Lady Vols again went 14–0 in the regular season against SEC competition, but again fell in the conference tournament. Tennessee won five games in the NCAA tournament only to lose 70–61 to Connecticut in the championship game for the second year in a row and third time in five years.
In 2004–05, Tennessee broke its losing streak against Connecticut with a narrow 68–67 regular season victory. Candace Parker, a highly regarded and nationally known high school player joined the Lady Vols. However, because of injuries, she was redshirted and didn&#x27;t play that season. Tennessee suffered losses during the regular season to Duke, Rutgers, and LSU, while beating Stanford and Louisiana Tech. LSU&#x27;s win over Tennessee gave the Tigers the SEC title, breaking Tennessee&#x27;s streak of seven straight regular season conference championships. However, Tennessee won its first tournament title in four years by avenging its earlier loss to LSU loss with a 67–65 win in the SEC Championship game. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee advanced to its fourth Final Four in a row by defeating a Rutgers team that had beaten them earlier in the year. In the Final Four, the Lady Vols blew a 16-point lead to fall 68–64 to underdog Michigan State. In the second round of the NCAA tournament, the Lady Vols defeated Purdue. This victory gave Pat Summitt her 880th win, breaking North Carolina coach Dean Smith&#x27;s record of 879 wins, and making her the all-time winningest coach in NCAA basketball history.

By 2005–06, Parker had recovered from her injuries and became a starter. During the season, the Lady Vols dropped three games to SEC foes, LSU, Florida, and Kentucky, to record their worst SEC season since the 1996–97 season. However, they won their second straight game against Connecticut and rebounded from a sub-par SEC season to win the conference tournament for the second year in a row. In the NCAA tournament, Tennessee received a number two seed instead of the one seed Summitt believed her team deserved, and played North Carolina in the regional finals. Tennessee trailed from the beginning, fell behind by as many as 16, rallied to cut the lead to five, but ultimately fell 75–63.

In the 2006–07 season, Tennessee defeated four ranked teams in a row: UCLA, Stanford, Arizona State, and Middle Tennessee, lost a regular season rematch with North Carolina and another game against top-ranked Duke, and defeated UConn for the third time in a row. Later, in Baton Rouge, the Lady Vols clinched the SEC title against LSU in a game where Candace Parker scored 27. However, in the SEC tournament semifinals, Tennessee fell to the Tigers. In the NCAA tournament, Summitt&#x27;s team easily made it to the Final Four, dispatching teams that included SEC foe Mississippi and 13-seeded Cinderella, Marist, winning each game by at least 14. In the Final Four, Tennessee again faced North Carolina. Despite shooting poorly, the Lady Vols came back from a 12-point deficit with 8:18 remaining to win 56–50. In the championship game against Rutgers, Tennessee won its seventh title. During the season, Summitt appeared at a men&#x27;s basketball game dressed in a cheerleader outfit and led the crowd in a rendition of &quot;Rocky Top&quot; to show her support for the team. A month earlier, her men&#x27;s counterpart, Bruce Pearl, showed up at a Lady Vols game in orange body paint.

The 2007–08 season started off with the top-ranked Lady Vols going 3–0, including wins over 9th-ranked Oklahoma and 22nd-ranked Texas. The win over Texas was Summitt&#x27;s 950th. After two more wins, top-ranked Tennessee knocked off fourth-ranked North Carolina, 83–79, in a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s Final Four match-up.
Tennessee won their next four games, then headed to California for a match-up with 5th-ranked Stanford. Down by 4 with less than 30 seconds remaining, the Lady Vols managed to tie the game up and send it to overtime, but lost, 73–69.
The Lady Vols responded by winning their next seven games, giving them a 17–1 record going into a match-up with Duke. Candace Parker&#x27;s 17 points and 12 rebounds, including a bucket with 22 seconds remaining, helped the Lady Vols defeat the Blue Devils for the first time in four years, 67–64. Tennessee would win the rest of their regular season games and defeat LSU for the SEC tournament championship. The Lady Vols won four straight games in the NCAA Tournament heading toward their third matchup of the year against the LSU Lady Tigers in the Final Four. Alexis Hornbuckle tipped in a Nicky Anosike missed layup with 0.7 seconds left to win the game, 47–46. On April 8, 2008, Tennessee won its second consecutive national championship (and eighth overall) by beating Stanford 64–48.

Summitt&#x27;s first milestone of the 2008–09 season was a 73–43 win over the Georgia Lady Bulldogs on February 5, 2009, at Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville. The win was the 1,000th for Coach Summitt. The Thompson–Boling Arena&#x27;s court was named &quot;The Summitt&quot; in her honor. The 2008–09 season ended with a dubious first, as the Lady Vols lost 71–55 in the first round of the NCAA tournament to Ball State in Bowling Green, Kentucky, marking the first time Tennessee would not appear in the Sweet 16 since the NCAA first sanctioned championships in women&#x27;s basketball for the 1981–82 season.

===2010s===
Summitt was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2011. Despite the diagnosis, she completed the 2011–2012 season in a reduced role, with Holly Warlick (an assistant under Summitt since 1985) assuming most of the coaching responsibilities. In an interview with GoVolsXtra.com, Summitt stated, &quot;There&#x27;s not going to be any and I&#x27;ll make sure of that.&quot; In December 2011, Summitt was honored as the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; sportswoman of the year.

As the 2011–12 season progressed, the team and the fans recognized that it was likely to be Summitt&#x27;s last year coaching, and Ann Killion of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called it &quot;heart-wrenching to witness&quot; when Warlick broke down in tears at the end of the regular season. In March, John Adams wrote in the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; that it would be &quot;too much to ask&quot; of Summitt and her staff to go through another season, and David Climer wrote in &quot;The Tennessean&quot; that it was time for Summitt to retire.

On April 18, 2012, after the Lady Vols lost to the unbeaten eventual champion Baylor Lady Bears in the Elite Eight in Des Moines, Summitt stepped down as head coach, ending her 38-year coaching career at age 59. Warlick was named Summitt&#x27;s successor. In a statement accompanying her resignation, Summitt said, &quot;I feel like Holly&#x27;s been doing the bulk of it. She deserves to be the head coach...&quot; Summitt was given the title Head Coach Emeritus upon her resignation. According to NCAA regulations, as head coach emeritus, she was able to attend practices and assist Warlick in some duties, but was not allowed to sit on the team bench.

Summitt was presented the USBWA Most Courageous Award at the 2012 Final Four, and future awards were given in her name. She received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award in 2012, saying in her acceptance speech: &quot;It is time to fight.&quot;

==USA Basketball involvement==

===Player===
Summitt was named to the U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team invited to compete at the 1975 Pan American Games. The team was coached by future Hall of Fame coach Cathy Rush. Players included Lusia Harris, Nancy Lieberman, Ann Meyers, and Juliene Simpson. After winning the gold medal in 1963, the USA team lost to Brazil in both 1967 and 1971 and had recently competed in the 1975 World Championship, finishing in eighth place. The opening game was against host-country Mexico which had finished ahead of the USA team at the World Championships. This time, the USA was victorious, beating Mexico 99–65. The USA would go on to win its next five games, all but one by a double-digit margin. That set up the gold medal game against Brazil which the USA team won convincingly, 74–55.

===Coach===
Summitt was named the head coach of the USA representative to the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team had recently completed the World Championship, so was able to bypass the preliminary rounds. The team won all six contests and the gold medal. Four USA players were named to the 12 player all-tournament team.

Summitt was chosen as the head coach of the team representing the USA in 1984 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The team chosen to represent the USA was the team expected to be selected as the national team for the 1984 Olympic Games. This resulted in a very strong team which was able to dominate the competition. In the opening game against Australia, the USA won 82–20. While other games were closer, Italy&#x27;s 23-point loss to the USA was the closest of the eight games. The USA won all eight games and the gold medal, and three of the team&#x27;s players were named to the All-Tournament Team.

==Books==
Summitt wrote three books, all with co-author Sally Jenkins: &quot;Reach for the Summitt&quot;, which is part motivational book and part biography; &quot;Raise the Roof&quot;, about the Lady Vols&#x27; 1997–1998 undefeated and NCAA-championship winning season; and &quot;Sum It Up&quot;, covering her life and her experience being diagnosed and living with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Coaching style and legacy==
Summitt was widely recognized as one of the toughest coaches in college basketball history. She was best known for giving her players an icy stare in response to poor play, known simply as &quot;The Summitt Stare&quot;. However, she claimed that she mellowed considerably later in her career. In 2007, Summitt told &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; that she didn&#x27;t yell at her players nearly as much as she had earlier in her career. On at least two occasions, Tennessee asked Summitt to consider coaching the men&#x27;s team: once before 1997 and again in 2001.

Summitt won 16 Southeastern Conference regular season titles with the Lady Vols, as well as 16 tournament titles. Summitt&#x27;s Lady Vols made an appearance in every NCAA Tournament from 1982 until her retirement, advanced to the Sweet 16 every year except 2009, and appeared 18 times in the Final Four. When Summitt made her 13th trip to the Final Four as a coach in 2002, she surpassed John Wooden as the NCAA coach with the most trips to the Final Four. Summitt was a seven-time SEC Coach of the year and a seven-time NCAA Coach of the year and won three consecutive national titles from 1996 to 1998. Summitt was known for scheduling tough opponents for her team to play in the regular season, in order to prepare them for the postseason. In her years of coaching, her teams played Top 10-ranked teams over 250 times.

Summitt finished her coaching career with 1,098 wins in 1,306 games coached in AIAW and NCAA Division I play. Summitt won eight NCAA Division I championships as a coach; as of June 2016, this is the third-highest total in the history of NCAA Division I men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.

Summitt received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2012. In 2013, an eight-foot bronze statue was erected in her honor on the University of Tennessee campus. A statue was dedicated to Summitt in her hometown of Clarksville, Tennessee, in 2018.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Pat Summitt married Ross Barnes Summitt II in 1980. The couple had one son, Ross Tyler Summitt, born in 1990. Summitt filed for divorce from her husband in 2007.

Tyler Summitt, who played as a walk-on for the Tennessee men&#x27;s basketball team, graduated from Tennessee in May 2012. He was hired as an assistant coach by the Marquette University women&#x27;s team effective with the 2012–13 season. In what &quot;ESPN.com&quot; columnist Gene Wojciechowski called &quot;a bittersweet irony&quot;, Tyler&#x27;s hiring by Marquette was announced on the same day his mother announced her retirement.

===Health===
In August 2011, Summitt announced that she had been diagnosed three months earlier with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She retired from coaching in 2012.

Summitt created a foundation to raise money for Alzheimer&#x27;s research and worked to raise awareness of the disease.

===Death===
Summitt died on June 28, 2016, two weeks after her 64th birthday, at a senior living facility in Knoxville where she crocheted and did many other hobbies in her free time. She left the entirety of her estate to her son, Tyler.

After her death, the Pat Summitt Alzheimer&#x27;s Clinic was opened at the University of Tennessee Medical Center, with funds from her Foundation. In 2017, the NCAA established the Pat Summitt Award to recognize individuals who positively influence college athletes.

<text>Jazz rap (also jazz hop or jazz hip hop) is a fusion of jazz and hip hop music, as well as an alternative hip-hop subgenre, that developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. AllMusic writes that the genre &quot;was an attempt to fuse African-American music of the past with a newly dominant form of the present, paying tribute to and reinvigorating the former while expanding the horizons of the latter.&quot; The rhythm was rooted in hip hop over which were placed repetitive phrases of jazz instrumentation: trumpet, double bass, etc. Groups involved in the formation of jazz rap included A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, De La Soul, Gang Starr, and Jungle Brothers.

==Overview==
During the 1970s, the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron placed spoken word and rhymed poetry over jazzy backing tracks. There are also parallels between jazz and the improvised phrasings of freestyle rap. While it drew from these disparate threads, jazz rap did not coalesce as a genre until the late 1980s.

At this time, the jazz community was divided between those who appreciated traditional styles and others who embraced newer forms like smooth jazz. This period also marked a significant shift in jazz&#x27;s cultural positioning, elevating it to the status of &quot;serious art music.&quot; Influential figures like Wynton Marsalis played a pivotal role in this transformation, advocating for a return to traditional jazz values.

Jazz rap&#x27;s emergence can be seen as an attempt to elevate rap music&#x27;s status by associating it with jazz&#x27;s cultural capital and was seen as an alternative to dominant rap subgenres like gangsta and pop rap. This association not only enriched the musical texture of hip-hop but also provided a platform for social and political commentary, aligning with jazz&#x27;s historical role as a voice for African American experiences and struggles.

==History==
In 1989, Gang Starr released the debut single &quot;Words I Manifest&quot;, sampling Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s 1952 &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;, and Stetsasonic released &quot;Talkin&#x27; All That Jazz&quot;, sampling Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; (Wild Pitch, 1989), and their track &quot;Jazz Thing&quot; (CBS, 1990) for the soundtrack of &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot;, further popularized the jazz rap style. In 1992, Eric B &amp; Rakim used wood bass on &quot;Don&#x27;t Sweat the Technique&quot;.

Digable Planets&#x27; 1993 release &quot;Reachin&#x27; (A New Refutation of Time and Space)&quot; was a hit jazz rap record sampling the likes of Don Cherry, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Herbie Mann, Herbie Hancock, Grant Green, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. It spawned the hit single &quot;Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)&quot;.

Also in 1993, Us3 released &quot;Hand on the Torch&quot; on Blue Note Records. All samples were from the Blue Note catalogue. The single &quot;Cantaloop&quot; was Blue Note&#x27;s first gold record.

Post-WWII swing and modern jazz had fused with the introduction of Black appeal radio, which attracted a younger audience through its reliance on jive idioms, rhyming, and cadence-laden rap verses. Dizzy Gillespie had pointed to &quot;The jives of Dr. Hepcat&quot; and rhyming D.J. Daddy-O Daylie as key to popularizing modern jazz. The rise of Top-40 radio on the strength of the rapping DJs in this period of radio&#x27;s rebirth among black youth led to the wider use of language and syntax popularizing rap. Muhammad Ali&#x27;s phrasing to the press in the early part of his career was born of listening to black radio of the 1950s, which was often white radio announcers speaking slang &quot;jive&quot; and imitating black announcers while withholding the fact on air of their backgrounds. Pioneering DJs Al Benson, Nat D., and Jack the Rapper all used rhyming, the dozens and jive talk to pepper their broadcasts and were widely copied by white DJs like John Richbourg, Gene Nobles, and Bill Allen during the 1950s, and whose influence on James Brown and other godfathers of rap was formative. Bebop was the backing track that modern jazz credits with being the foundation black appeal radio is based on.

===Native Tongues===
Groups making up the collective known as the Native Tongues tended toward jazzy releases: these include the Jungle Brothers&#x27; debut, &quot;Straight Out the Jungle&quot; (Warlock, 1988), and A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; (Jive, 1990). &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; has become one of hip hop&#x27;s most acclaimed albums, and also earned praise from jazz bassist Ron Carter, who played double bass on one track. De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;Buhloone Mindstate&quot; (Tommy Boy, 1993) featured contributions from Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Pee Wee Ellis, and samples from Eddie Harris, Lou Donaldson, Duke Pearson and Milt Jackson. Queen Latifah and Monie Love were members of Native Tongues also.

Also of this period was Toronto-based Dream Warriors&#x27; 1991 release &quot;And Now the Legacy Begins&quot; (Island). It produced the hit singles &quot;My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style&quot; and &quot;Wash Your Face in My Sink&quot;. The first of these was based on a loop taken from Quincy Jones&#x27; &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot;, while the second sampled Count Basie&#x27;s 1967 rendition of &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot;. Meanwhile, Los Angeles hip hop group Freestyle Fellowship pursued a different route of jazz influence in recordings with unusual time signatures and scat-influenced vocals.

===Jazz artists come to hip hop===
Though jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, jazz legend Miles Davis&#x27; final album (released posthumously in 1992), &quot;Doo-Bop&quot;, featured hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Jazz musician Branford Marsalis collaborated with Gang Starr&#x27;s DJ Premier on his Buckshot LeFonque project that same year. Between 1993 and 2000 fellow Gang Starr member Guru released &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot;, which featured guest appearances from jazz artists such as Lonnie Liston Smith, Freddie Hubbard and Donald Byrd, amongst others. 

===Since 1994===
Musical jazz references became less obvious and less sustained, and lyrical references to jazz certainly more rare. However, jazz had been added to the palette of hip hop producers, and its influence continued throughout the 1990s whether behind the gritty street-tales of Nas (&quot;Illmatic&quot;, Columbia, 1994), or backing the more bohemian sensibilities of acts such as the Roots, the Nonce, and Common. Since 2000 it can be detected in the work of producers such as J. Rawls, Fat Jon and Madlib. A project somewhat similar to Buckshot Le Fonque was Brooklyn Funk Essentials, a New York–based collective who also released their first LP in 1994. Prince himself contributed to the genre on some songs from 1991 to 1992, as well as with his New Power Generation album &quot;Gold Nigga&quot;, which mixed jazz, funk and hip-hop and was released very confidentially.

One hip hop project which continued to maintain a direct connection to jazz was Guru&#x27;s &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; series, which used live jazz musicians in the studio. Spanning from 1993 to 2007, its four volumes assembled jazz luminaries like Freddie Hubbard, Donald Byrd, Courtney Pine, Herbie Hancock, Kenny Garrett and Lonnie Liston Smith, and hip hop performers such as Kool Keith, MC Solaar, Common, and Guru&#x27;s Gang Starr colleague DJ Premier.

Madlib&#x27;s 2003 release &quot;Shades of Blue&quot; paid homage to his Blue Note Records roots, where he samples from Blue Note&#x27;s archives. The album also contains interpretations of Blue Note classics performed by Yesterdays New Quintet.

<doc id="213804" wikidata="Q346565" url="?curid=213804" title="Bill Withers">
<text>William Harrison Withers Jr. (July 4, 1938 – March 30, 2020) was an American singer and songwriter. He is known for having several hits over a career spanning 18 years, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; (1971), &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Hands&quot; (1971), &quot;Use Me&quot; (1972), &quot;Lean on Me&quot; (1972), &quot;Lovely Day&quot; (1977) and &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; (1980) (recorded in collaboration with Grover Washington Jr.). Withers won three Grammy Awards out of nine total nominations. 

His life was the subject of the 2009 documentary film &quot;Still Bill&quot;. Withers was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Two of his songs, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Lean on Me&quot;, were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
William Harrison Withers Jr., the youngest of six children, was born in the small coal mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, on July 4, 1938. He was the son of Mattie (née Galloway), a maid, and William Withers, a miner. Withers was of African-American and English descent. He developed a stutter as a child and later said he had a hard time fitting in. His parents divorced when he was three, and he was raised by his mother&#x27;s family in nearby Beckley, West Virginia. He was 13 years old when his father died.

==Career==
Withers enlisted in the United States Navy at the age of 17 and served for nine years, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. He left the Navy in 1965, relocating to Los Angeles in 1967 to start a music career.

His debut release was &quot;Three Nights and a Morning&quot; in 1967. Arranged by Mort Garson, the song went unnoticed at the time but was later reworked by Withers as the track &quot;Harlem.&quot;

Withers worked as a mechanical assembler for several different companies, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation, IBM and Ford, while recording demo tapes with his own money, shopping them around, and performing in clubs at night. When he hit with the song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; in 1971, he refused to resign from his job because he believed the music business was a fickle industry.

===Music career===
Withers continued to work on his musicianship, learning guitar.

====Sussex Records====

In early 1970, Withers&#x27; demo tape was auditioned favorably by Clarence Avant, owner of Sussex Records. Avant signed Withers to a record deal and assigned former Stax Records stalwart Booker T. Jones to produce Withers&#x27;s first album. Four three-hour recording sessions were planned for the album, but funding caused the album to be recorded in three sessions with a six-month break between the second and final sessions. &quot;Just as I Am&quot; was released in 1971 with the tracks, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Hands&quot; as singles. The album features Stephen Stills playing lead guitar. On the cover of the album, Withers is pictured at his job at Weber Aircraft in Burbank, California, holding his lunch box.

The album was a success, and Withers began touring with a band assembled from members of the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. Withers won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards in 1972. The track had already sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in September 1971.

During a hiatus from touring, Withers recorded his second album, &quot;Still Bill&quot;. The single, &quot;Lean on Me&quot; went to number one the week of July 8, 1972. It was Withers&#x27; second gold single with confirmed sales in excess of three million. His follow-up, &quot;Use Me&quot;, released in August 1972, became his third million-seller, with the R.I.A.A. gold disc award taking place on October 12, 1972. His performance at Carnegie Hall on October 6, 1972, was recorded and released as the live album &quot;Bill Withers, Live at Carnegie Hall&quot; on November 30, 1972. In 1974, Withers recorded the album &quot;+&#x27;Justments.&quot; 

During this time, he wrote and produced two songs on the Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips album &quot;I Feel a Song&quot;, and in October 1974 performed in concert together with James Brown, Etta James, and B.B. King in Zaire four weeks prior to the historic Rumble in the Jungle fight between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. Footage of his performance was included in the 1996 documentary film &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, and he is heard on the accompanying soundtrack. Other footage of his performance is included in the 2008 documentary film &quot;Soul Power&quot;.

Withers has said of Sussex Records “They weren’t paying me.&quot; He claims to have erased an entire album that he had recorded for the label in a fit of pique. “I could probably have handled that differently,” he said. Due to a legal dispute with the Sussex company, Withers was unable to record for some time thereafter.

====Columbia Records====
After Sussex Records folded, Withers signed with Columbia Records in 1975. His first album release with the label, &quot;Making Music&quot;, included the single &quot;She&#x27;s Lonely,&quot; which was featured in the film &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; along with &quot;She Wants to (Get on Down)&quot;. During the next three years he released an album each year with &quot;Naked &amp; Warm&quot; (1976), &quot;Menagerie&quot; (1977; containing the successful &quot;Lovely Day&quot;), and &quot;&#x27;Bout Love&quot; (1978).

Due to problems with Columbia and being unable to get songs approved for his album, he decided to focus on joint projects from 1977 to 1985, including &quot;Just the Two of Us,&quot; with jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., which was released during February 1981. The song won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song. Withers next released &quot;Soul Shadows&quot; with the Crusaders, and &quot;In the Name of Love&quot; with Ralph MacDonald, the latter being nominated for a Grammy for vocal performance.

In 1982, Withers was a featured vocalist on the album &quot;Dreams in Stone&quot; by French singer Michel Berger. This record included one composition co-written and sung by Withers, &quot;Apple Pie&quot; an upbeat disco song about New York City.

In 1985 came &quot;Watching You, Watching Me&quot;, which featured the Top 40-rated R&amp;B single “Oh, Yeah!” and ended Withers&#x27; business association with Columbia Records. Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album—in particular, two of the first three singles released—were the same songs that had been rejected in 1982, contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums. Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for Mr. T, an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual songwriter, from releasing his own. He toured with Jennifer Holliday in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.

Withers&#x27; disdain for Columbia&#x27;s A&amp;R executives—or &quot;blaxperts&quot; as he termed them—trying to exert control over his sound to sell more albums played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign with a record label after 1985. This effectively ended his performing career, though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his &quot;retirement.&quot; Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he said he was socialized as a &quot;regular guy&quot; who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry. After he left the music industry, he said that he did not miss touring and performing live and did not regret leaving music behind.

====Post-Columbia career====
In 1988, a new version of &quot;Lovely Day&quot; from the 1977 &quot;Menagerie&quot; album, entitled &quot;Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)&quot; and remixed by Ben Liebrand was released. The original release had reached number 7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to number 4.

At the 30th Annual Grammy Awards in 1988, Withers won the Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of &quot;Lean on Me&quot; by Club Nouveau. This was Withers&#x27; ninth Grammy nomination and third win. Withers contributed two songs to Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s 2004 release &quot;License to Chill&quot;. Following the reissues of &quot;Still Bill&quot; on January 28, 2003, and &quot;Just As I Am&quot; on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album. In 2006, Sony Music gave Withers’ previously unreleased tapes back to him. In 2007, &quot;Lean on Me&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014, &quot;Bill Withers: The Complete Sussex &amp; Columbia Albums Collection&quot;, a nine-disc set featuring Withers&#x27; eight studio albums as well as his live album &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;, received the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album (sharing the award with the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Charlie Is My Darling – Ireland 1965&quot;). The award was presented to Leo Sacks, who produced the collection, and the mastering engineers Mark Wilder, Joseph M. Palmaccio, and Tom Ruff.

In 2005, Withers was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In April 2015, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Stevie Wonder. He described the honor as &quot;an award of attrition&quot; and said: &quot;What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain&#x27;t a genre that somebody didn&#x27;t record them in. I&#x27;m not a virtuoso, but I was able to write songs that people could identify with. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve done bad for a guy from Slab Fork, West Virginia.&quot; Later that year, a tribute concert in his honor was held at Carnegie Hall featuring Aloe Blacc, Ed Sheeran, Dr. John, Michael McDonald, and Anthony Hamilton. The concert recreated Withers&#x27; 1973 concert album, &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;, along with some of his other material. Withers was in attendance and spoke briefly onstage.

In February 2017, he made an appearance on Joy Reid&#x27;s MSNBC show to talk about the refugee crisis as well as the political climate in America.

===&quot;Still Bill&quot; documentary===
The 2009 documentary, &quot;Still Bill&quot;, explored his reasons for quitting the music industry and painted the picture of a fulfilled musician and human being. Roger Ebert said: &quot;[Withers] still lives and survives as a happy man. &quot;Still Bill&quot; is about a man who topped the charts, walked away from it all in 1985 and is pleased that he did.&quot;

==Legacy==

Withers is known for his &quot;smooth&quot; baritone vocals and &quot;sumptuous&quot; soul arrangements. He wrote some of the most covered songs of the 1970s, including &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine.&quot; The former entered the Hot 100 chart through multiple versions, including Club Nouveau&#x27;s 1987 cover, which made the composition one of nine songs to have led the chart via different acts. With &quot;Lovely Day&quot;, he set the record for the longest sustained note on an American chart hit, holding a high E for 18 seconds. 

Editors from &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered that Withers&#x27; songs are &quot;some of the most beloved in the American songbook&quot;, citing, &quot;&#x27;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&#x27; is regarded as one of the all-time great breakup tracks, while &#x27;Lean on Me&#x27; [is] an ode to the supportive power of friendship ...&quot; For the same newspaper, Alex Petridis noticed &quot;[he] laid pain and paranoia under his deceptively gentle songs, and retired early having conquered gospel, funk, blues, disco and more.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Andy Greene noted that several of his songs &quot;are embedded in the culture and have been covered countless times.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Giovanni Russonello considered Withers &quot;[a] soulful singer with a gift for writing understated classics&quot;, adding, &quot;the ultimate homespun hitmaker, he had an innate sense of what might make a song memorable, and little interest in excess attitude or accoutrements. Ultimately Withers reminded us that it&#x27;s the everyday that is the most meaningful: work, family, love, loss.&quot; A &quot;Billboard&quot; article considered that Withers &quot;stands as one of R&amp;B/soul music&#x27;s most revered singer-songwriters.&quot; In the same magazine, writer Gail Mitchell acknowledged &quot;Withers&#x27; legacy has flourished in the decades since, thanks to a cross-section of artists who have covered/sampled his songs or cited him as a major influence.&quot; 

Musician and music journalist Questlove referred to Withers&#x27; post-breakup 1974 album &quot;+&#x27;Justments&quot; as &quot;a diary [...] [it] was a pre-reality-show look at his life. Keep in mind this was years before Marvin Gaye did it with &quot;Here, My Dear&quot;.&quot; The Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson deemed him &quot;a songwriter&#x27;s songwriter&quot;. Musicians Sade, D&#x27;Angelo, Justin Timberlake, John Legend and Ed Sheeran have credited Withers as a music inspiration.

Withers has been widely sampled by hip hop and pop music artists, including Basehead, Blackstreet, Kendrick Lamar, DMX, Tupac Shakur, Jennifer Lopez and Aaliyah.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Withers at number 106 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. The Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry inducted &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; in the 2024 list of 25 sound recordings.

==Personal life==

Withers married actress Denise Nicholas in 1973 during her stint on the sitcom &quot;Room 222&quot;. They divorced in 1974.

In 1976, Withers married Marcia Johnson. They had two children, Todd and Kori. Marcia eventually assumed the direct management of his publishing companies, in which his children also became involved as they became adults.

Withers died from heart complications in a Los Angeles hospital on March 30, 2020, at age 81; his family announced his death four days later. 

The family statement read:

We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world. In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones.

He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

<doc id="213805" wikidata="Q605778" url="?curid=213805" title="Digital Underground">
<text>Digital Underground is an American alternative hip hop group from Oakland, California. Its lineup grows with each album and tour.

Digital Underground&#x27;s leader and mainstay was Gregory &quot;Shock G&quot; Jacobs (also known as Humpty Hump). Shock G formed the group in 1987 with Tampa hip-hop radio deejay Kenneth &quot;Kenny-K&quot; Waters and Jimi &quot;Chopmaster J&quot; Dright of Berkeley, California.

Heavily influenced by the various funk bands of the 1970s, Digital Underground sampled such music frequently, which became a defining element of West Coast rap. As &quot;Rackadelic&quot;, Jacobs designed album covers and cartoon-laced liner notes, in homage to Parliament-Funkadelic album designs. Digital Underground is also notable for launching the career of member Tupac Shakur, as well as spinning off side projects and solo acts including Raw Fusion, Saafir, and singer Mystic.

Following the release of their &quot;Doowutchyalike&quot; single and video in the summer of 1989, the band gained popularity with their song &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; in 1990. Digital Underground toured nearly every year until 2008; this consisted of live shows in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. While the group&#x27;s origins lay mostly in Oakland and Berkeley, California, various characters and voices from around the U.S and UK appeared on the band&#x27;s albums. Shock G and Money-B were the only individuals to appear on every album. Other recurring key contributors were David &quot;DJ Fuze&quot; Elliot, and deejay/producer Jeremy &quot;J-Beats&quot; Jackson, who both assisted Jacobs in developing the sound.

Shock G died in 2021, but Digital Underground continues to tour.

==History==

===Formation===
Jacobs spent most of his youth in Tampa, Florida and New York City. Founded in 1987, the group&#x27;s image was originally more militant, and was intended to be a tribute to social activists The Black Panthers. However, when groups like Public Enemy and N.W.A rose to prominence, Jacobs chose to take the image in a more whimsical and upbeat direction.

===&quot;Sex Packets&quot;===
&quot;Sex Packets&quot;, the group&#x27;s debut album, was released in early 1990 following the success of their two previous singles, which were included on the album. &quot;Doowutchyalike,&quot; a moderate club hit, debuted the previous year, followed in January by the more successful song &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot;, a humorous dance number that reached #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, #7 on the R&amp;B charts, and #1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart. It was rapped by Shock G&#x27;s alter ego Humpty Hump, and featured a drum track with over 50 confirmed usages in other songs. &quot;Sex Packets&quot; features P-Funk samples, jazz-influenced interludes, and a combination of samples and live instrumentation, earning it positive reviews and platinum sales.

===&quot;This Is an EP Release&quot;===
&quot;This Is an EP Release&quot; is the RIAA Gold certified second Digital Underground release, from which two songs, &quot;Tie the Knot&quot; and &quot;Same Song&quot; were featured in the film &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot; starring Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Demi Moore, and John Candy. &quot;Tie The Knot,&quot; features jazzy piano tracks and a comedic interpretation of &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot;. &quot;Same Song&quot; has an organ solo and improvised organ bits throughout the song, making it one of hip hop&#x27;s first singles to successfully integrate live instrumentation with music samples. Tupac Shakur made his debut on the latter song and portrayed an African king in the video. Tupac also can be heard joking around on the remixed version of &quot;The Way We Swing&quot; as a background vocalist, adding humorous ad-libs between the verses. Tupac first began to appear on stage with the group as one of its dancers and &quot;hype men&quot;.

===&quot;Sons of the P&quot;===
The group&#x27;s second full album featured two singles, &quot;No Nose Job&quot; and &quot;Kiss You Back&quot;, the latter of which featured multi-layered choruses and background vocals sung by Boni Boyer, who briefly worked with Digital Underground shortly after her stint with Prince&#x27;s Sign of the Times/Love Sexy band. Despite the fact that a choir of singers were portrayed in the video, the actual studio singing was exclusively Boni on all tracks, excluding the male voices. It has been mistakenly reported that &quot;Kiss You Back&quot; was co-written and co-performed by George Clinton, but his name appears in the writers credit due to a sample of &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; by Funkadelic being used. He did, however, actively participate in the writing and recording of the title track &quot;Sons of the P&quot;, which he also contributed vocals to, and which marked one of the earliest studio guest appearances by Clinton on a Hip Hop release, which is preceded only by Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;Magilla Gorilla&quot; released in 1986. Both the album and the &quot;Kiss You Back&quot; single were each certified Gold by the RIAA.

===&quot;The Body-Hat Syndrome&quot;===
With the leading single &quot;The Return of the Crazy One,&quot; and its accompanying X-rated video, which was reworked for public consumption, gaining positive feedback, the rest of &quot;The Body-Hat Syndrome&quot; unfurled to less than outstanding crossover commercial acclaim. The album&#x27;s second single, an anti-racism cultural awareness politico called &quot;Wussup Wit the Luv,&quot; featured a solo from Funkadelic guitarist Michael Hampton, as well as a verse and video appearance from Tupac Shakur. This would be the last time Tupac appeared on any Digital Underground release, while lead rappers Saafir and Clee were added to the band&#x27;s lineup. This album also features &quot;The Humpty Dance Awards&quot;, the group&#x27;s humorous shout-out to the artists who sampled the Humpty Dance prior to 1993.

===&quot;Future Rhythm&quot;===
&quot;Future Rhythm&quot;, the group&#x27;s fourth full album, would be their first independent release, including two songs that were featured in the Wayans brothers&#x27; film &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot;: &quot;Food Fight&quot;, featuring Del tha Funkee Homosapien, and &quot;We Got More&quot; with Luniz. The album also contains an early performance from rapper Sly Boogy, while he was still a member of the Black Spooks, who appeared on the song &quot;Fool Get a Clue.&quot;

===&quot;Who Got the Gravy?&quot;===
In 1998, eight years after the group&#x27;s first album, Digital Underground released &quot;Who Got the Gravy?&quot;, which reached #91 on the Top 200 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Digital Underground being a West Coast act, the album intentionally featured several East Coast rappers at a time when the East vs. West rivalry was active, in an attempt to both ignore and ridicule it. The guests included New York City natives Big Pun, Biz Markie and KRS-One, and introduced Whuteva and Stylez, while also introducing west coast bay area newcomers Esinchill and female emcee Mystic.

===&quot;..Cuz A D.U. Party Don&#x27;t Stop!&quot;===
Digital Underground&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;..Cuz a D.U. Party Don&#x27;t Stop!&quot;, was released on May 20, 2008, although a substantial portion of it was recorded at a live show from 2005. Shortly before its release, the group embarked on an indefinite hiatus. Money-B has stated that Shock G expressed interest in writing a book and exploring music that the latter would deem unfit for the Digital Underground name.

On May 18, 2010, The Greenlight EP was released, which features some previously unreleased Digital Underground tracks.

<text>Imprisonment or incarceration is the restraint of a person&#x27;s liberty for any cause whatsoever, whether by authority of the government, or by a person acting without such authority. In the latter case it is considered &quot;false imprisonment&quot;. Imprisonment does not necessarily imply a place of confinement with bolts and bars, but may be exercised by any use or display of force (such as placing one in handcuffs), lawfully or unlawfully, wherever displayed, even in the open street. People become prisoners, wherever they may be, by the mere word or touch of a duly authorized officer directed to that end. Usually, however, imprisonment is understood to imply actual confinement against one&#x27;s will in a prison employed for the purpose according to the provisions of the law. Generally gender imbalances occur in imprisonment rates, with incarceration of males proportionately more likely than incarceration of females.

==History==

=== Africa ===
Before colonisation, imprisonment was used in sub-Saharan Africa for pre-trial detention, to secure compensation and as a last resort but not generally as punishment, except in the Songhai Empire (1464–1591) and in connection with the slave trade. In the colonial period, imprisonment provided a source of labor and a means of suppression. The use of imprisonment has continued to the present day.

=== Australia ===
Incarceration in what became known as Australia was introduced through colonization. As noted by scholar Thalia Anthony, the Australian settler colonial state has engaged in carceral tactics of containment and segregation against Aboriginal Australians since colonizers first arrived, &quot;whether that be for Christian, civilizing, protectionist, welfare, or penal purposes.&quot; When settlers arrived, they invented courts and passed laws without consent of Indigenous peoples that stated that they had jurisdiction over them and their lands. When Indigenous peoples challenged these laws, they were imprisoned.

===England and Wales===
In English law, imprisonment is the restraint of a person&#x27;s liberty. The 17th century book Termes de la Ley contains the following definition:

Imprisonment without lawful cause is a tort called false imprisonment.
In England and Wales, a much larger proportion of the black population is imprisoned than of the white.

==Release==
When a prisoner completes serving their sentence, start probation, or is given a compassionate release they are no longer considered prisoners and are released to the outside world. A prisoner of war may be released as a result of the end of hostilities or a prisoner exchange. Prisoners serving a full life or indefinite sentence may never be released.

Released prisoners may suffer from issues including psychiatric disorders, criminalized behaviours and access to basic needs. Some criminals, particularly criminals convicted of serious crimes (felonies or indictable offenses,) are given restrictions after release, including bans from buying firearms or jury duty exclusion. Post release resources may be provided by the authorities. Various factors have been investigated as to their influence on post-release recidivism, such as family and other relationships, employment, housing and ability to quit drug use.
