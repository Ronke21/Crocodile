<text>Gambas is an object-oriented dialect of the BASIC programming language, and an integrated development environment that accompanies it. Designed to run on Linux and other Unix-like computer operating systems, its name is a recursive acronym for &quot;Gambas Almost Means Basic&quot;. Gambas is also the word for prawns in the Spanish, French, and Portuguese languages, from which the project&#x27;s logos are derived.

== History ==
Gambas was developed by the French programmer Benoît Minisini, with its first release coming in 1999. Benoît had grown up with the BASIC language, and decided to make a free software development environment that could quickly and easily make programs with user interfaces.

The Gambas 1.x versions were first released on January 4, 2005, and featured an interface made up of several different separate windows for forms and IDE dialogues in a similar fashion to the interface of earlier versions of the GIMP. It could also only develop applications using Qt and was more oriented towards the development of applications for KDE. The last release of the 1.x versions was Gambas 1.0.19.
The first of the 2.x versions was released on January 2, 2008, after three to four years of development. It featured a major redesign of the interface, now with all forms and functions embedded in a single window, as well as some changes to the Gambas syntax, although for the most part code compatibility was kept. It featured major updates to existing Gambas components as well as the addition of some new ones, such as new components that could use GTK+ or SDL for drawing or utilize OpenGL acceleration. Gambas 2.x versions can load up and run Gambas 1.x projects, with occasional incompatibilities; the same is true for Gambas 2.x to 3.x, but not from Gambas 1.x to 3.x.

The next major iteration of Gambas, the 3.x versions, was released on December 31, 2011. A 2015 benchmark published on the Gambas website showed Gambas 3.8.90 scripting as being faster to varying degrees than Perl 5.20.2 and the then-latest 2.7.10 version of Python in many tests. Version 3.16.0 released on April 20, 2021, featured full support for Wayland using the graphical components, as well as parity between the Qt 5 and GTK 3 components.

== Features ==

Gambas is designed to build graphical programs using the Qt (currently Qt 4.x or 5.x since 3.8.0) or the GTK toolkit (GTK 3.x also supported as of 3.6.0); the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas. Gambas includes a GUI designer to aid in creating user interfaces in an event-driven style, but can also make command line applications, as well as text-based user interfaces using the ncurses toolkit. The Gambas runtime environment is needed to run executables.

Functionality is provided by a variety of components, each of which can be selected to provide additional features. Drawing can be provided either through Qt and GTK toolkits, with an additional component which is designed to switch between them. Drawing can also be provided through the Simple DirectMedia Layer (originally version 1.x, with 2.x added as of 3.7.0), which can also be utilized for audio playback through a separate sound component (a component for the OpenAL specification has also been added). GPU acceleration support is available through an OpenGL component, as well as other hardware functionally provided by various other components. There are also components for handling other specialized tasks.

With Gambas, developers can also use databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, build KDE (Qt) and GNOME GTK applications with DCOP, translate Visual Basic programs to Gambas and run them under Linux, build network solutions, and create CGI web applications. The IDE also includes a tool for the creation of installation packages, supporting GNU Autotools, slackpkg, pacman, RPM, and debs (the latter two then tailored for specific distributions such as Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, Mageia, Mandriva, OpenSUSE and Debian, Ubuntu/Mint). Support for AppImage building was mainlined with version 3.19.0.

Gambas since version 3.2 IDE has integrated profiler and it started to use just-in-time compilation technology.

=== Differences from Visual Basic ===
Gambas is intended to provide a similar experience as developing in Microsoft Visual Basic, but it is not a free software clone of the popular proprietary program. The author of Gambas makes it clear that there are similarities to Visual Basic, such as syntax for BASIC programs and the integrated development environment; Gambas was written from the start to be a development environment of its own and seeks to improve on the formula.

Its object model, each class being represented in a file, as well as the archiver to package the program is all inspired by the Java programming language. Gambas is intended to be an alternative for former Visual Basic developers who have decided to migrate to Linux. There are also other important distinctions between Gambas and Visual Basic. One notable example is that in Gambas array indexes always start with 0, whereas Visual Basic indexes can start with 0 or 1. Gambas also supports the += and -= shorthand not found in classic Visual Basic. Both of these are features of Visual Basic .NET however.

Gambas also outlived two other attempts at implementing a Visual Basic style interface for Qt and GTK on Linux, those being HBasic and GNOME Basic, as well as the platform independent KBasic/Basic for Qt. Similar style IDEs have since been developed as well for FreeBASIC, namely VisualFBEditor, and QB64, namely InForm.

== Adoption ==

Several programs and many forms of example code have been written using and for Gambas. Freecode (formerly Freshmeat) listed 23 applications that were developed using Gambas, while the Gambas wiki listed 82; several other specialized sites list Gambas applications and code.

A Gambas written application, named Gambas3 ShowCase, acted as a software center to download or install Gambas 3 applications. It has since been discontinued following the launch of the first party Gambas Software Farm integrated into the IDE since 3.7.1, which contains nearly 500 applications and demos. Several community sites, including community forums and mailing lists, also exist for Gambas.

Notable applications written in Gambas include Xt7-player-mpv, a GUI frontend for mpv player contained in a number of Linux software repositories, and I-Nex, a program for displaying hardware data. The comisat Games Collection are early examples of video games written in Gambas.

== Availability ==
Gambas is included in the repositories of a number of Linux distributions, such as Debian, Fedora, Slackware, Arch Linux, Mageia, PCLinuxOS, Linux Mint and Ubuntu. A Microsoft Windows version of Gambas was run under the Cygwin environment, although this version was significantly less tested than its Linux counterparts and was command-line only; Cooperative Linux and derivatives have also been used, as well as specialized Linux virtual machines. An independent contributor, François Gallo, also worked on porting Gambas 3.x to Mac OS X and FreeBSD, based on using local versions of the X11 system. A build for Haiku has also been worked on by Francois Revol. Gambas from version 3.2 can run on Raspberry Pi, and offers just-in-time compilation there from version 3.12. It can also be run from the cloud using rollApp.

In November 2013, the future portability of Gambas was discussed, listing the main concerns being Linux kernel features utilized in the interpreter, components using Linux specific software and libraries, and primarily X11-tying in the Qt, GTK and desktop integration components. However, partly due to the need to upgrade to newer toolkits such as GTK 3 (added as of 3.6.0) and Qt 5 (as of 3.8.0), future versions would be less X11 tied, making projects like Cygwin or utterly native versions on other platforms more possible. Benoît Minisini stated that he intended to &quot;encapsulate&quot; X11 specific code to aid in any attempt to replace it, with the X11 support in the desktop component moved to its own component as of 3.6.0.

On October 27, 2016, a screenshot and setup guide was released from the main page for running Gambas fully through Cygwin, including most components, graphical toolkits, and the complete IDE. The relevant patches were mainlined as of version 3.9.2. This replaces the prior recommended method of using freenx forwarding from a Linux server. It has also been successfully run using the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This was usually done using an X terminal emulator such Mobaxterm on Windows, as WSL did not support X11 graphics directly until Windows 11.

== Example code ==
A &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program with graphical user interface.
Public Sub Main()
 Message(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
End
Program that computes a 100-term polynomial 500000 times, and repeats it ten times (used for benchmarking).
Private Sub Test(X As Float) As Float

 Dim Mu As Float = 10.0
 Dim Pu, Su As Float
 Dim I, J, N As Integer
 Dim aPoly As New Float[100]

 N = 500000

 For I = 0 To N - 1
 For J = 0 To 99
 Mu = (Mu + 2.0) / 2.0
 aPoly[J] = Mu
 Next
 Su = 0.0
 For J = 0 To 99
 Su = X * Su + aPoly[J]
 Next
 Pu += Su
 Next

 Return Pu

End

Public Sub Main()

 Dim I as Integer

 For I = 1 To 10
 Print Test(0.2)
 Next

<text>Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas (born October 13, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. She was discovered as a teenager by record producer Irv Gotti, and signed with his label Murder Inc. Records, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings in 2002. That same year, Ashanti guest appeared on the singles &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; by Fat Joe, and &quot;Always on Time&quot; by Ja Rule, which peaked at numbers two and one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively; the latter, with her 2002 debut single &quot;Foolish&quot;, made her the first female artist to occupy the top two positions the chart simultaneously.

&quot;Foolish&quot; served as lead single for Ashanti&#x27;s eponymous debut album (2002). Despite mixed reviews, it debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), won Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top 40 singles &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot;. She then co-wrote and provided background vocals for Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s 2002 single &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny (Murder Remix)&quot;, which peaked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her second album, &quot;Chapter II&quot; (2003), became her second to peak the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received platinum certification by the RIAA. It received three nominations at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, while its lead singles, &quot;Rock wit U (Awww Baby)&quot; and &quot;Rain on Me&quot;, peaked at numbers two and seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. Her third album, &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, was released that same year as a Christmas album; it was met with a steep critical and commercial decline.

Ashanti&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; (2004), debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 despite mixed critical response. Its lead single, &quot;Only U&quot;, peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart—her most successful song in that country. Its second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Them&quot;, saw limited success due to Def Jam&#x27;s legal issues with Murder Inc. label head Irv Gotti. Her fifth album, &quot;The Declaration&quot; (2008), was met with moderate reception and became her final release on a major label; her sixth album, &quot;Braveheart&quot; (2014), was released independently. Ashanti has sold nearly 30 million records worldwide.

Ashanti has acted in several productions, debuting in the film &quot;Coach Carter&quot; and starring in the TV special &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (both 2005), the latter of which attracted nearly eight million viewers. She also appeared in &quot;John Tucker Must Die&quot; (2006) and &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; (2007).

== Early life ==
Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas was born on October 13, 1980, in Glen Cove, New York. Her mother, Tina Douglas, is African American and a former dance teacher. Her father, Ken-Kaide Thomas Douglas, is also African American and a former singer. She is the oldest of her parents&#x27; children, with a younger sister named Kenashia &quot;Shia&quot; Douglas. Ashanti&#x27;s mother named her after the Ashanti Empire in Ghana; in this nation, women had power and influence, and Tina wanted Ashanti to follow that model. Her grandfather, James, was a civil rights activist who was associated with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s.

Ashanti&#x27;s mother discovered her full singing potential when she overheard Ashanti singing Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;Reminisce&quot; at age 12 (after the song was released on Ashanti&#x27;s birthday). While attending high school, Ashanti began to write songs. As a teenager, she performed in a local talent show and at several small festivals. She got her first taste of acting as a child extra in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992) and in Ted Demme&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;. She also had a couple of minor appearances in music videos, such as KRS-One&#x27;s &quot;MC&#x27;s Act Like They Don&#x27;t Know&quot; as well as 8-Off&#x27;s &quot;Ghetto Girl&quot;.

Ashanti struggled to find success as a singer after being courted by several record labels, including Bad Boy and Jive. Despite this, she continued to perform in and around New York and began hanging out at the Murder Inc. recording studio, hoping for a big break.

== Career ==

=== 2001–2003: &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Chapter II&quot; and &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot; ===
Ashanti was first noticed by Irv Gotti because of her vocal skills. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun&#x27;s song &quot;How We Roll&quot;. In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah&#x27;s singles &quot;Pov City Anthem&quot; and &quot;Just Like a Thug&quot;. She also appeared on the 2001 &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita&#x27;s 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and on the solo track &quot;When a Man Does Wrong&quot;. She was then featured on Fat Joe&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; and Ja Rule&#x27;s &quot;Always on Time&quot;. &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; and &quot;Always on Time&quot; were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first woman to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart simultaneously when &quot;Always on Time&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; were at numbers one and two, respectively.

Following the success of her collaborations with Ja Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti released her debut single, &quot;Foolish&quot;, which contains a sample of the 1983 song &quot;Stay with Me&quot; by DeBarge (also used by The Notorious B.I.G. in his 1995 single &quot;One More Chance&quot;, and by Big L in &quot;MVP&quot;). This is her biggest success to date, spending ten weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Ashanti&quot;, was released on Irv Gotti&#x27;s Murder Inc. record label in April 2002. It debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The album has been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide. Ashanti wrote the album&#x27;s twelve tracks, most of which were written on the spot in the studio. Ashanti&#x27;s follow-up singles, &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot;, were not as successful as her debut single but peaked inside the top ten and top twenty in the U.S., respectively. Ashanti&#x27;s debut album earned her many awards, including eight &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album. Ashanti was the first artist to win Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album before the category was last awarded in 2011. She was nominated as Best New Artist and &quot;Foolish&quot; was nominated in the Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance category. She also received a Comet Award and two Soul Train Music Awards that same year.

Ashanti became the subject of controversy when it was announced that she would receive the Soul Train Aretha Franklin Award for &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot;. A high school student took offense and started an online petition against her, explaining to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; that she was too new to deserve the award. Nearly 30,000 people agreed with him, signing the petition. Many said that established artists such as Mary J. Blige and Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott or critically acclaimed singers like Alicia Keys and India Arie were more deserving of an award that carries the name of a musical legend. Despite the petition, the Soul Train committee and Don Cornelius stuck by their decision. Ashanti was applauded by her musical peers as she entered the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to accept her award and she was supported onstage by Patti LaBelle, who stated &quot;she&#x27;s a baby and we have to support our babies.&quot;

Just before the release of her second album, Ashanti headlined &quot;VH1 Divas Duets&quot; alongside Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, Beyoncé, and Lisa Marie Presley. During the concert, she performed duets with the Isley Brothers and Stevie Wonder and participated in the all-star finale performance of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Higher Ground.&quot;

In July 2003, Ashanti released her second album, &quot;Chapter II&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went platinum, selling over 1.5  a million copies in the U.S. &quot;Chapter II&quot;&#x27;s first single, &quot;Rock wit U (Awww Baby)&quot;, became a hit, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its video, which showed Ashanti in a bikini frolicking on a beach and riding an elephant, was nominated for two 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. A remix of the song contains interpolations of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Rock with You&quot;. The second single, &quot;Rain on Me&quot;, reached the number seven spot on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot 100 R&amp;B Songs chart. &quot;Chapter II&quot; was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, and &quot;Rock wit U (Awww Baby)&quot; and &quot;Rain on Me&quot; were nominated in the categories of Best R&amp;B Song and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, respectively. In the &quot;Rain on Me,&quot; mini-movie music video—directed by Hype Williams and co-starring Larenz Tate—Ashanti portrays a troubled young woman in an abusive relationship. She received a Lifetime Channel Achievement Award for her message speaking out against domestic violence. That same year, she began dating rapper Nelly.

In November 2003, Ashanti released a Christmas album titled &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. It contained 10 Christmas songs and was a modest commercial success and sold just around 100,000 units in the U.S. The album peaked at No. 160 in the Billboard charts.

=== 2004–2007: &quot;Concrete Rose&quot;, &quot;Collectibles by Ashanti&quot; and acting ===

Before &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; was released, Ashanti did some major promotion for her single &quot;Only U&quot;, when she premiered it at the 2004 Vibe Music Awards. She featured on &quot;Wonderful&quot;—with Ja Rule and R. Kelly—that year, which peaked at number five in the U.S. and at number one in the UK. In December 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, &quot;Concrete Rose&quot;, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur&#x27;s pseudonym &quot;The Rose That Grew from Concrete&quot;. The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became her third platinum-certified album. The first single, &quot;Only U&quot;, reached number thirteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Them&quot;, garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti&#x27;s legal troubles during his money laundering trial. The single was released only in the U.S., where it failed to chart, and the UK, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. After the release of &quot;Concrete Rose&quot;, Ashanti released the DVD &quot;Ashanti: The Making of a Star&quot;, which was available only for a limited time. The deluxe DVD includes an exclusive photo and video shoot footage, music from the albums &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Chapter II&quot; and &quot;Concrete Rose&quot;, special concert footage, unreleased childhood school performances, and behind-the-scenes interviews with family, friends, and fans.

In 2005, Ashanti focused more on her acting career, making her feature film acting debut in the film &quot;Coach Carter&quot; alongside Samuel L. Jackson, as well as starring as Dorothy Gale in the made-for-television film &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, which pulled in nearly 8 million viewers when it premiered. She sang &quot;When I&#x27;m with You&quot; for the film which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy in the Outstanding Music and Lyrics category. In &quot;Coach Carter,&quot; she played a pregnant teenager named Kyra who has to decide whether or not to abort her unborn child. The movie opened at number-one at the U.S. box office, eventually grossing $67  million domestically. Later in 2005, Ashanti was invited to Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Legends Ball, which honored some of the most influential and legendary African American women of the twentieth century in the fields of art, entertainment, and civil rights. In December 2005, Ashanti released a remix album of &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; titled &quot;Collectables by Ashanti&quot;. The album was an opportunity for her to fulfill her contract with Def Jam (and have the option of working with another label). It did not fare well on the charts.

In 2006, she starred in the teen comedy &quot;John Tucker Must Die&quot;, which opened and peaked at number three at the U.S. box office (competing with &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;) and grossed $68,818,076 worldwide. In 2007, she played a supporting role in the action film &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; (2007).

=== 2008–2010: &quot;The Declaration&quot;, departure from The Inc. and &quot;The Wiz&quot; ===

Her fourth studio album, &quot;The Declaration&quot;, was released on June 3, 2008, and sold 86,000 units its first week of release, which were the lowest first-week sales for any of Ashanti&#x27;s studio albums. In mid-2007, MTV News reported that the first single from &quot;The Declaration&quot; was &quot;Switch&quot;, which was produced by Shy Carter and released digitally in the United States on July 24, 2007. It was later reported that &quot;Switch&quot; may not be included on the album&#x27;s track listing, and that the first single would be &quot;Hey Baby (After the Club)&quot; it was released to radio and digital outlets on October 16. The song, which does not appear on the U.S. editions of the album, peaked at number eighty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. &quot;The Way That I Love You&quot;, was released to radio and digital outlets in January 2008, and was referred to as the &quot;first single&quot; in press material and media reports. It reached number two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number thirty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Ashanti&#x27;s first song to reach the top forty since &quot;Only U&quot; in 2004. &quot;Body On Me&quot; was recorded not only for Ashanti&#x27;s &quot;The Declaration&quot;, but also for Nelly&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Brass Knuckles&quot;. The track is produced by Akon and Giorgio Tuinfort. It went to number one on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Videoclip Tracks chart in its first week, becoming the first number-one single from Nelly&#x27;s album.&quot;Good Good&quot; was released to urban radio stations on July 16, 2008. The song contains elements of Elton John&#x27;s 1974 single &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, and has the same melody arrangement as Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;. In July 2008, Ashanti was named an ambassador of tourism for Nassau County, Long Island.

In May 2009, Irv Gotti announced that he was officially releasing Ashanti from The Inc. Records, stating that &quot;The relationship has run its course. The chemistry of what&#x27;s needed — we&#x27;re in two totally different places. You&#x27;re talking to somebody that took her and shaped and molded her and put her out there for the world, and it blew up. We [hold the record] for the [fastest] selling debut by a female R&amp;B artist — 503 [thousand]. We did it! My views and philosophies and her views and philosophies are not meeting up.&quot; Gotti also admitted that he and Ashanti have not spoken to each other in a long time. A representative for Ashanti did not respond. On September 24, 2009, Ashanti announced her fifth studio album would be released from her new label, Written Entertainment.

Ashanti headlined the cast of &quot;The Wiz&quot; in the New York City Center Encores! Summer Stars staging from June 12 to July 5, 2009. Ashanti&#x27;s role as Dorothy has since received mixed reviews from critics as most praised her vocals but was less pleased with her acting ability. BET and Entertainment Weekly both praised the singer&#x27;s performance as The New York Post and New York Times gave lukewarm reviews. Though the first night was sold out, some of the other shows were unable to follow its success. On October 27, 2008, Ashanti took part in &quot;The Yellow Brick Road Not Taken&quot;, a one night only concert to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Wicked, featuring songs written by Stephen Schwartz, that were cut from the show.

=== 2011–2014: Hiatus and &quot;Braveheart&quot; ===

After a four-year hiatus, Ashanti released the song &quot;Never Too Far Away&quot;, which was featured in Morgan Creek&#x27;s film &quot;Dream House&quot; starring Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz with Naomi Watts. The lead single from her fifth studio album, &quot;The Woman You Love&quot; featuring American rapper Busta Rhymes, was released online on December 15, 2011. Ashanti teamed up with Meek Mill and French Montana for the second single &quot;No One Greater&quot;, which was produced by 7 Aurelius, Irv Gotti and Chink Santana. In April 2013, she released another single called &quot;Never Should Have&quot;, which later won &quot;Best Independent R&amp;B/Soul Performance&quot; at the 2013 Soul Train Awards. A music video for the track was also released.

In November 2012, it was reported that she had landed her first series regular role in the seventh season of &quot;Army Wives&quot;, playing Latasha Montclair. The series was canceled on September 24, 2013. In the fall of 2013, she appeared in a guest spot on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; alongside Clay Aiken and Taylor Hicks. She also starred in the Lifetime film &quot;Christmas in the City&quot; which premiered on December 7, 2013.

In August 2013, Ashanti announced her plans to once again work with Ja Rule, who&#x27;d been released from prison in July of that year following a six-year sentence stemming from a gun charge. On January 8, 2014, she revealed the official cover art and release date for &quot;Braveheart&quot;, her fifth album, which was released on March 4, 2014. In January 2014, Ashanti shot the video for the official first single from &quot;Braveheart&quot; titled &quot;I Got It&quot; featuring Rick Ross. The video was shot in Miami, Florida, and was directed by Eif Rivera. In July, Ashanti announced that the second official single from &quot;BraveHeart&quot; would be &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; featuring French Montana. Upon release, the album garnered favorable reviews, with music critics describing &quot;Braveheart&quot;&#x27;s sound as an &quot;evolution of R&amp;B&quot; and praising the themes of empowerment but criticizing the romantic clichés and lack of interesting moments on the album. On the charts, &quot;Braveheart&quot; opened at number ten in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Ashanti&#x27;s fifth consecutive top-ten album, as well as her first Independent Albums chart-topper. It also debuted in the top thirty of the UK R&amp;B Albums Chart and top-forty of the UK Indie Albums Chart.

=== 2015–present: Collaborations===

In 2015, she announced that she had worked on new music for her seventh album, with an unknown release date. Ashanti collaborated with Michelle Obama for her #Let&#x27;sMove campaign to spread awareness of drinking water with her new video and song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; released in 2015. In 2016, she collaborated on the song &quot;Seven Day Love&quot; included in the album &quot;Inzombia&quot; by Canadian singer Belly. She has also worked with numerous artists, including Sia, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Queen Latifah, Usher and Kelly Clarkson to interpret the songs of the Broadway musical &quot;&quot;Hamilton&quot;&quot; for the compilation &quot;The Hamilton Mixtape&quot;.

In 2017, Ashanti announced her seventh studio album, revealing it would be released in 2018. She denied this in June 2018, confirming the future release of an album in collaboration with rapper Ja Rule. Between 2017 and 2018 she returned to the music scene with several collaborations including the single &quot;Say Less&quot; with Ty Dolla Sign, the track &quot;The Road&quot; by Machel Montano, and the song &quot;Start This Shit Off Right&quot; with Mack Maine, from the album &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; by Lil Wayne.

Ashanti released the collaboration &quot;Pretty Little Thing&quot; with Afro B in August 2019. She was also featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Stuck&quot;, which she produced. In November 2019, Ashanti guest-starred as herself in two episodes of the third season of The CW&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot; reboot: &quot;Mother, I&#x27;m At La Mirage&quot; and &quot;Something Desperate&quot;.

In January 2021, Ashanti released her single &quot;2:35 (I Want You)&quot;. On March 10, 2022, Ashanti&#x27;s single &quot;Rock wit U (Awww Baby)&quot; was heavily sampled for British rapper Aitch&#x27;s single &quot;Baby&quot;. In October 2022, Ashanti was featured on Diddy’s “Gotta Move On” remix which also features Bryson Tiller and Yung Miami. In February 2024, she was featured on Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s single &quot;This Lil&#x27; Game We Play&quot; alongside Nelly and Juicy J.

== Artistry ==
Ashanti has a lyric soprano voice type. Critics have referred to her voice as &quot;pretty&quot; and her soprano as &quot;sultry&quot; and &quot;sweet but slight&quot;. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic noted her reputation for using her &quot;swooning voice&quot; in duets with Big Pun, Fat Joe, and Ja Rule. As a young girl, Ashanti was influenced by Ella Fitzgerald, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tupac Shakur, but she cites Mary J. Blige as the main reason she wanted to pursue a singing career. Further musical influences include Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Smokey Robinson, Donna Summer, and Blue Magic.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2003, Ashanti partnered with LidRock and the San Francisco-based Family Violence Prevention Fund (FVPF) to raise awareness about the issue of domestic violence during National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and to distribute the &quot;Rain on Me&quot; mini-movie using LidRock&#x27;s unique platform. Proceeds from the $5 mini-disc went towards helping to stop domestic violence. Ashanti also recorded a public service announcement that appeared in more than 4,000 film screens and reached millions of people. Ashanti also gives back by raising money for sickle cell research and she is active in helping the Make-A-Wish Foundation stating, &quot;I&#x27;ll go and do just about anything for them.&quot; In 2005, Ashanti helped by recording public service announcement and raising money for the Southeast Asia tsunami disaster. Later that year, she helped raise money for the Hurricane Katrina victims and storm evacuees.

In November 2009, Ashanti joined the crew of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;. In the episode, which aired on January 24, 2010, the singer assisted in the rebuilding of the Powell Family home in Buffalo, New York. The efforts from the show expanded significantly to include not just the family home but the entire neighborhood surrounding it. In 2013, Ashanti featured on the 19-track compilation album &quot;Songs for a Healthier America&quot;, a collaborative project by the Partnership for a Healthier America, whose honorary chair is Michelle Obama, and Hip Hop Public Health. Her song &quot;Just Believe&quot; also featured Artie Green, Gerry Gunn, Robbie Nova and Chauncey Hawkins. Additionally, she is affiliated with the Jumpstart reading program, the Tupperware Brand and the Boys and Girls Club of America.

== Personal life ==
Ashanti dated Nelly from 2003 to 2013 after meeting at the 2003 Grammy Awards. The two began dating again in 2023. In December 2023, it was reported the couple were expecting their first child together and had married on the 27th. In April 2024, Ashanti confirmed her pregnancy and the couple&#x27;s engagement in &quot;Essence&quot; magazine. On July 18, 2024, the couple welcomed their first child.

<doc id="215836" wikidata="Q312718" url="?curid=215836" title="Eye for an eye">
<text>&quot;An eye for an eye&quot; (, ) is a commandment found in the Book of Exodus 21:23–27 expressing the principle of reciprocal justice measure for measure. The earliest known use of the principle appears in the Code of Hammurabi, which predates the writing of the Hebrew Bible but not necessarily oral traditions.

The law of exact retaliation (), or reciprocal justice, bears the same principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree by the injured party. In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation. The intent behind the principle was to &quot;restrict&quot; compensation to the value of the loss.

==Definition and methods==
The term &quot;lex talionis&quot; does not always refer to literal eye-for-an-eye codes of justice (see mirror punishment), but rather applies to the broader class of legal systems that formulate penalties for specific crimes, which are thought to be fitting in their severity. Some propose that this was at least in part intended to prevent excessive punishment at the hands of either an avenging private party, or the state. The most common expression of lex talionis is &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, but other interpretations have been given as well. Legal codes following the principle of &quot;lex talionis&quot; have one thing in common - prescribed &#x27;fitting&#x27; counter punishment for a felony. The simplest example is the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; principle. In that case, the rule was that punishment must be exactly equal to the crime.

==In Babylonian law==
In the legal Code of Hammurabi, the principle of exact reciprocity is very clearly used. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death.

Various ideas regarding the origins of this law exist, but a common one is that it developed as early civilizations grew and a less well-established system for retribution of wrongs, feuds and vendettas, threatened the social fabric. Despite having been replaced with newer modes of legal theory, &quot;lex talionis&quot; systems served a critical purpose in the development of social systems—the establishment of a body whose purpose was to enact the retaliation and ensure that this was the only punishment. This body was the state in one of its earliest forms. The principle can be found in earlier Mesopotamian law codes such as the Codes of Ur-Nammu of Ur and Lipit-Ištar of Isín.

The principle is found in Babylonian Law. If it is surmised that in societies not bound by the rule of law, if a person was hurt, then the injured person (or their relative) would take vengeful retribution on the person who caused the injury. The retribution might be worse than the crime, perhaps even death. Babylonian law put a limit on such actions, restricting the retribution to be no worse than the crime, as long as victim and offender occupied the same status in society. As with blasphemy or lèse-majesté (crimes against a god or a monarch), crimes against one&#x27;s social betters were punished more severely.

==In ancient Greek law==
Anaximander, teacher of Pythagoras: &quot;The grand periodicities of nature are conceived of enacting cycles of retaliatory retribution.&quot; Socrates rejected this law.

==In Hebrew law==
The law of the Hebrews rejected this law; the Hebrew Bible allows for &quot;kofer&quot; (a monetary payment) to take the place of a bodily punishment for any crime except murder. It is not specified whether the victim, accused, or judge had the authority to choose &quot;kofer&quot; in place of bodily punishment.

The idiomatic biblical phrase in Exodus and Leviticus literally means &#x27;one eye under/(in place of) one eye&#x27; while a slightly different phrase (, literally &#x27;eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth&#x27; ...) is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses. The &quot;only one eye for one eye&quot; was to compensation to the value of the loss. 

The English translation of a passage in Leviticus states, &quot;And a man who injures his countrymanas he has done, so it shall be done to him [namely,] fracture under/for fracture, eye under/for eye, tooth under/for tooth. Just as another person has received injury from him, so it will be given to him.&quot; (Lev. 24:19–21). For an example of being used in its regular sense of &#x27;under&#x27;, see Lev. 22:27 &quot;A bull, sheep or goat, when it is born shall remain under its mother, and from the eighth day...&quot;

An English translation of Exodus 21:22-24 states: &quot;If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman&#x27;s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.&quot;

===Judaism===
Isaac Kalimi said that the lex talionis was &quot;humanized&quot; by the Rabbis who interpreted &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; to mean reasonable pecuniary compensation. As in the case of the Babylonian &quot;lex talionis&quot;, ethical Judaism and humane Jewish jurisprudence replaces the &quot;peshat&quot; (literal meaning) of the written Torah. Pasachoff and Littman point to the reinterpretation of the lex talionis as an example of the ability of Pharisaic Judaism to &quot;adapt to changing social and intellectual ideas.&quot;

====Talmud====
The Talmud interprets the verses referring to &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and similar expressions as mandating monetary compensation in tort cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.

However, the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice, where the phrase &quot;ayin tachat ayin&quot; makes another appearance. Here, the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person. The Torah requires the court to &quot;do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother&quot;. Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria (such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was not yet executed), wherever it is possible to punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow, the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice (including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty). Otherwise, the offenders receive lashes.

Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender (punitary amputation) there is no case where a conspiratorial false witness could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, or foot. There is one case where the Torah states &quot;…and you shall cut off her hand…&quot; The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner. This verse teaches that, although one must intervene to save the victim, one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury. Regardless, there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye, tooth, or foot.

Numbers 35:9–30 discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court, where, under very limited circumstances, someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of &quot;redeemer of blood&quot;. In such cases, the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge. While the guilty party is there, the &quot;redeemer of blood&quot; may not kill him. If, however, the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile, the &quot;redeemer of blood&quot;, as an accessory of the court, may kill the guilty party.

According to traditional Jewish Law, application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge, as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud. The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment. These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years.

====Objective of reciprocal justice in Judaism====
The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (&quot;middah k&#x27;neged middah&quot;) in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society (&quot;…and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst&quot;) and to deter potential criminals from violating the law (&quot;And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst&quot;). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).

The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah&#x27;s conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether or not the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow Israelites.

====Social hierarchy and reciprocal justice====
In Exodus 21, as in the Code of Hammurabi, the concept of reciprocal justice seemingly applies to social equals; the statement of reciprocal justice &quot;life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe&quot; is followed by an example of a different law: if a slave-owner blinds the eye or knocks out the tooth of a slave, the slave is freed but the owner pays no other consequence. On the other hand, the slave would probably be put to death for the injury of the eye of the slave-owner.

However the reciprocal justice applies across social boundaries: the &quot;eye for eye&quot; principle is directly followed by the proclamation &quot;You are to have one law for the alien and the citizen.&quot; This shows a much more meaningful principle for social justice, in that the marginalized in society were given the same rights under the social structure. In this context, the reciprocal justice in an ideal functioning setting, according to Michael Coogan, &quot;to prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and exacting disproportionate vengeance for offenses committed against them.&quot;

==In Roman law==
Classical texts advocating the retributive view include Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Legibus&quot;, written in the 1st century BC.

Roman law moved toward monetary compensation as a substitute for vengeance. In cases of assault, fixed penalties were set for various injuries, although &quot;talio&quot; was still permitted if one person broke another&#x27;s limb.

==In Islamic law==
The Quran (Q5:45) mentions the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; concept as being ordained for the Children of Israel. The principle of Lex talionis in Islam is Qiṣāṣ (Arabic: قصاص) as mentioned in : &quot;O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (&quot;Qisas&quot;) for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment.&quot; Muslim countries that use Islamic &quot;Sharia&quot; law, such as Iran or Saudi Arabia, apply the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; rule literally.

In 2017, an Iranian woman wounded in an acid attack was given the opportunity to have her attacker blinded with acid per sharia law.

==Applications==
* The death penalty is applied to murderers in some jurisdictions.
* The paramilitary group Nakam sought to kill six million Germans as revenge for the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust.

== Criticism ==
=== An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind ===
The phrase &quot;an eye for an eye makes the (whole) world blind&quot; and other similar phrases has been conveyed by, but not limited to George Perry Graham (1914) on capital punishment debate argument, Louis Fischer (1951) describing philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. (1958) in the context of racial violence.

<text>Tiffany Lane (born August 16, 1974), better known by her stage name Charli Baltimore, is an American rapper, and television personality. Her stage name is taken from Geena Davis&#x27;s character in the film &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;.

==Career==
Charli Baltimore began her musical career when she met the Notorious B.I.G. in the winter of 1995, and they became involved in a romantic relationship. Several months into their relationship, she left him a voicemail of a rap verse that she had written and he began encouraging her to pursue a career in rap music.

Following the death of B.I.G., Charli continued her career in the industry, booking several modeling jobs and creating a number of hip-hop and R&amp;B songs including &quot;Money&quot;, with Gamble and Huff, and &quot;Stand Up&quot;, which rose to the top ten of the &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; &quot;Hot Rap Singles Chart&quot;. Despite her moderate success on the charts, Baltimore&#x27;s first studio album &quot;Cold as Ice&quot; was never released.

In 2001, she signed to Irv Gotti&#x27;s Murder Inc. Records. Baltimore&#x27;s first appearance as a Murder Inc. signee was on Ja Rule&#x27;s &quot;Down Ass Bitch&quot;, which peaked in the top 25 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;. The single landed on Ja Rule&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Pain Is Love&quot;, which sold over three million copies in America. The following year, she appeared on the Murder Inc. compilation album, &quot;Irv Gotti Presents: The Inc.&quot;, making appearances on the songs &quot;&quot;We Still Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot;, &quot;No One Does It Better&quot;, and the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Down 4 U&quot;. &quot;Down 4 U&quot; was another success for Baltimore, peaking in the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;The Last Temptation&quot;, as well as the Christina Milian track &quot;Spending Time&quot;, and Ashanti&#x27;s &quot;Rain on Me&quot; (remix). In 2003, she earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rap Solo Performance, for her single &quot;Diary&quot;. Baltimore parted ways with Irv Gotti and Murder Inc in 2004.

In 2019, Charli was announced as a cast member on WeTV&#x27;s &quot;Growing Up Hip Hop&quot;, with daughter, Sianni.

<doc id="215843" wikidata="Q11072051" url="?curid=215843" title="Cam Ranh Bay">
<text>Cam Ranh Bay () is a deep-water bay in Vietnam in Khánh Hòa Province. It is located at an inlet of the South China Sea situated on the southeastern coast of Vietnam, between Phan Rang and Nha Trang, approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).

Cam Ranh is considered the finest deepwater shelter in Southeast Asia. The continental shelf of Southeast Asia is relatively narrow at Cam Ranh Bay, bringing deep water close to land.

Since 2011–2014, Vietnamese authorities have hired Russian consultants and purchased Russian technologies to re-open Cam Ranh Bay (a former United States and later Soviet military base) as the site of a new naval maintenance and logistics facility for foreign warships.

== Overview ==
Historically, the bay has been significant from a military standpoint. The French used it as a naval base for their forces in Indochina. It was also used as a staging area for the 40-ship Imperial Russian fleet under Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky prior to the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, and by the Japanese Imperial Navy in preparation for the invasion of British Malaya and British Borneo (today Malaysia) in 1942. In January 1945 U.S. Naval Task Force 38 destroyed most Japanese facilities in an action called Operation Gratitude, after which the bay was abandoned.

In 1964, United States Seventh Fleet reconnaissance aircraft, the seaplane tender &quot;Currituck&quot;, and Mine Flotilla 1 units carried out hydrographic and beach surveys and explored sites for facilities ashore. This preparatory work proved fortuitous when a North Vietnamese trawler was discovered landing munitions and supplies at nearby Vũng Rô Bay in February 1965; the incident led the United States to develop Cam Ranh as a major base.

The United States Air Force operated a large cargo/airlift facility called Cam Ranh Air Base, which was also used as a tactical fighter base. It was one of three aerial ports where United States military personnel entered or departed South Vietnam for their 12-month tour of duty.

The United States Army operated a major port facility and depot at Cam Ranh.

The United States Navy flew various aircraft from Cam Ranh and other bases, conducting aerial surveillance of South Vietnam&#x27;s coastal waters.

The APO for Cam Ranh Air Base was APO San Francisco 96326.

In May 1972, Cam Ranh facilities were turned over to the South Vietnam government.

==Construction==

In 1963, Admiral Harry D. Felt, the U.S. Commander in Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC) foresaw that pier facilities at the natural deep-water bay at Cam Ranh might be useful in the future. At the direction of the Navy&#x27;s Officer in Charge of Construction RVN (OICC RVN), the American construction consortium RMK was directed to begin construction of a long pier and causeway. This project was completed in mid-1964.

In mid-1965, military engineers of the U.S. Army 35th Engineer Construction Group debarked at Cam Ranh Bay via LST&#x27;s to set up camp and start building roads for the Cam Ranh Base. They started by establishing a quarry and then building a road leading from the quarry to the base through the desert sand using red laterite soil for a base and crushed granite rock for a topping. Once the roads were in place to carry heavy equipment, the engineers lengthened the existing pier to to provide an additional berth for deep-water freighters. By the end of the year, the Army engineers had added equipment storage platforms, a petrol-oil-lubricants storage area, and port cantonment and support facilities.

Also in mid-1965, the American construction consortium RMK-BRJ and engineers of the Navy Officer in Charge of Construction RVN returned to construct a new airfield starting with a temporary runway with 2.2 million square feet (200,000 square meters) of AM-2 aluminum matting to accommodate jet fighter-bombers. By September, they had employed 1,800 Vietnamese workers for the work, over half of whom were women. The Army engineers and the civilian constructors shared equipment and expertise. The runway was completed in 50 days, with Admiral U.S.G. Sharp, CINCPAC, laying the last AM-2 plank on 16 October 1965. A 1.3 million square feet (120,000 square meters) cargo apron using pierced steel planking, airport facilities and utilities, mess halls, and 25,000 square feet (2,300 square meters) of living quarters were also prepared for use by the U.S. Air Force.

In 1966, four DeLong piers were added to the port. In January 1966, the OICC RVN tasked RMK-BRJ with construction of the Army Ammunition and Logistic Support Facility, consisting of thirty by concrete slabs for warehouses and six by slabs, 122 ammunition hardstands, and of roads. This work was completed by June 1966, and then RMK-BRJ turned to construction of a new concrete runway and taxiway at the air base. Later in 1966, RMK-BRJ filled in swamp land with sand at the southern end of the peninsula and constructed a naval base for Operation Market Time coastal patrols.

On 1 January 1966, the 20th and 39th Engineer Battalions and the 572nd Light Equipment Company arrived at Cam Ranh Bay to construct another pier at the port, and added a DeLong pier to the causeway at the ammunition depot.

== Cam Ranh Air Base ==
== Army use of Cam Ranh Bay ==
During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Army maintained the 6th Convalescent Center (6th CC) at Cam Ranh Bay enabling most wounded soldiers to be treated in country. Only those who required advanced treatment not available in Vietnam got sent out of country. Injured and wounded soldiers whose injuries had received initial treatment, usually at an evacuation hospital unit, but who could not immediately return to duty, were sent to the 6th CC where they could recover and, if needed, receive further treatment which did not require hospitalization. The &quot;wards&quot; were typical wooden US Army Vietnam-type barracks. Some patients, based on the status of their injuries, were initially admitted to an Intensive Care ward. They were nothing like what one would view as an Intensive Care ward in a regular hospital. They were the normal barracks type &quot;wards,&quot; but the patients were more closely monitored. When well enough, patients were moved to a regular ward, from which they were ultimately discharged when recovered enough to return to duty with their units.

Shortly after midnight on 7 August 1969 a Viet Cong sapper attack on the base penetrated the north perimeter and the sappers threw Satchel charges into the 6th CC killing 2 Americans and wounding 98 and damaging 19 buildings for no VC losses.

The Cam Ranh Support Command was the logistical organization controlling the port and depot at Cam Ranh. As of 31 July 1970, its authorized strength was 7,927, assigned 7,848. The 124th Transportation Command ran the port and truck transportation units. The port had 5 piers, 4 for general cargo (including one with Sea-Land cranes) and one further north for ammunition, plus a jetty for tankers. Sea-Land installed its cranes on pier 4 in 1967; the first Sea-Land ship arrived in November 1967. In January 1970, the port received its first containerized shipment of ammunition on Sea-Land&#x27;s &quot;Azalea City&quot;. The depot was operated by the 504th Army Depot. Power ships anchored in the lower harbor provided electricity to the Support Command facilities.


== Naval use of Cam Ranh Bay ==
Cam Ranh Bay became the center of coastal air patrol operations with the establishment in April 1967 of the U.S. Naval Air Facility, Cam Ranh Bay, and the basing there of P-2 Neptune and P-3 Orion patrol aircraft. That summer, the commander of the coastal surveillance force and his staff moved their headquarters from Saigon to Cam Ranh Bay and set up operational command post to control the Operation Market Time effort. Country wide coordination also was enhanced with establishment of the Naval Communications Station.

In the beginning the shore facilities at Cam Ranh Bay were extremely limited, requiring interim measures to support assigned naval forces. Army depots provided common supplies, while Seventh Fleet light cargo ships and delivered Navy-peculiar items from Subic Bay in the Philippines. Until mid-1966 when shore installations were prepared to take over the task, messing and quartering of personnel were handled by APL-55, anchored in the harbor. Also, a pontoon dock was installed to permit the repair of the coastal patrol vessels. Gradually the Naval Support Activity Saigon, Detachment Cam Ranh Bay, improved the provision of maintenance and repair, supply, finance, communications, transportation, postal service, recreation, and security support.

While the concentration at Cam Ranh Bay of Market Time headquarters and forces during the summer of 1967, the demand for base support became extraordinary. Accordingly, the Naval Support Activity Saigon, Detachment Cam Ranh Bay, was redesignated the Naval Support Facility, Cam Ranh Bay, a more autonomous and self-sufficient status. A greater allocation of resources and support forces to the shore installation resulted in an improved ability to cope with the buildup of combat units. In time, the Cam Ranh Bay facility accomplished major vessel repair and dispensed a greater variety of supply items to the anti-infiltration task force. In addition the naval contingent at the Joint Service Ammunition Depot issued ammunition to the coastal surveillance, river patrol and mobile riverine forces as well as to the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s gunfire support destroyers and landing ships. Seabee Maintenance unit 302 provided public works assistance to the many dispersed Naval Support Activity, Saigon detachments.

As a vital logistic complex, Cam Ranh Bay continued to function long after the Navy&#x27;s combat forces withdrew from South Vietnam as part of the Vietnamization of the war. However, between January and April 1972 the Naval Air Facility, and the Naval Communications Station turned over their installations to the Republic of Vietnam Navy and were duly disestablished.

== Capture of Cam Ranh Bay ==

By the early spring of 1975 North Vietnam realized the time was right to conquer South Vietnam, so they launched a series of small ground attacks to test U.S. reaction.

With the fall of the Central Highlands and the northern provinces of South Vietnam, a general panic had set in. By 30 March, order in the city of Da Nang and in Da Nang harbor had completely broken down. Forward North Vietnamese forces fired on American vessels in Da Nang harbor and sent sappers ahead to destroy port facilities, and refugees sought to board any boat or craft afloat.

Initially, Cam Ranh Bay was chosen as the safe haven for these South Vietnamese troops and civilians transported by boat from Da Nang. But, even Cam Ranh Bay was soon in peril. Between 1 and 3 April, many of the refugees just landed at Cam Ranh reembarked for further passage south and west to Phú Quốc Island in the Gulf of Siam, and ARVN forces pulled out of the facility.

On 3 April 1975, North Vietnamese forces captured Cam Ranh Bay and all of its military facilities.

== Soviet and Russian naval base ==


Four years after the fall of Saigon and the unification of North and South Vietnam, Cam Ranh Bay became an important Cold War naval base for the Soviet Pacific Fleet.

In 1979, the Soviet government signed an agreement with Vietnam for a 25-year lease of the base. Cam Ranh Bay was the largest Soviet naval base outside the Soviet Union, allowing it to project increased power in the East Sea. By 1987, they had expanded the base to four times its original size and often made mock attacks in the direction of the Philippines, according to intelligence of the United States Pacific Fleet. Analysts suggested that the Vietnamese side also saw the Soviet presence there as a counterweight against any potential Chinese threat. The Soviet Union and Vietnam officially denied any presence there. However, as early as 1988, then-Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze had discussed the possibility of a withdrawal from Cam Ranh Bay, and concrete naval reductions were realised by 1990.

As the original 25-year lease was nearing its end, the Vietnamese government announced that following the expiration of Russia&#x27;s lease in 2004, Vietnam would &quot;not sign an agreement with any country to use Cam Ranh Bay for military purposes&quot;. By this time, almost all personnel and naval vessels had been withdrawn, with only technical support for the listening station remaining. On 17 October that year, the Russian government announced that it would withdraw from Cam Ranh Bay completely before its rent-free lease was to expire in 2004. The reversion of the base back to sole Vietnamese control took place on 2 May 2002. That same day, the Russian flag was lowered for the last time. On October 7, 2016, Russia indicated it was reconsidering if possible to return to naval facilities in Vietnam. Though as of 2024, there hasn’t been any talks of such between the two countries.

== Today ==

After the Russian withdrawal, the United States negotiated with Vietnam to open Cam Ranh Bay to calls by foreign warships, as it previously had done with the ports of Haiphong in northern Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh City in the south. In a move that security commentators say is aimed at countering China&#x27;s build-up of naval power in the South China Sea, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung announced on October 31, 2010, that the bay would reopen to foreign navies after a three-year project to upgrade the port&#x27;s facilities. Vietnam has hired Russian consultants to direct the construction of new ship-repair facilities, which are scheduled to be available to foreign warships.

The United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta visited Cam Ranh Bay in June 2012, the first visit by an American official of cabinet rank to Vietnam since the Vietnam War.

On 2 October 2016, US Navy ships and made the first port visit to Cam Ranh Bay since 1975.

Cam Ranh remains a major base of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy, being the headquarter of the 4th Regional Command, headquarter of Vietnam Naval Air Force and home to Vietnam&#x27;s only submarine base.

=== Ba Ngoi Port ===
Ba Ngoi Port is an international commercial port located within Cam Ranh Bay, which has advantageous natural conditions and potential for developing seaport services, such as: the depth of anchorage area, airtight and wide bay, nearby International Marine route (about 10 km), Cam Ranh Airport (about 25 km), National Highway No.1A (about 1.5 km) and National Railway (about 3 km). Therefore, it has been an important centre of marine traffic covering the economic zone of south Khanh Hoa and neighbouring provinces for a long time.

<doc id="215844" wikidata="Q672506" url="?curid=215844" title="Pulp (paper)">
<text>Pulp is a fibrous lignocellulosic material prepared by chemically, semi-chemically or mechanically producing cellulosic fibers from wood, fiber crops, waste paper, or rags. Mixed with water and other chemicals or plant-based additives, pulp is the major raw material used in papermaking and the industrial production of other paper products.

== History ==
Before the widely acknowledged invention of papermaking by Cai Lun in China around AD 105, paper-like writing materials such as papyrus and amate were produced by ancient civilizations using plant materials which were largely unprocessed. Strips of bark or bast material were woven together, beaten into rough sheets, dried, and polished by hand. Pulp used in modern and traditional papermaking is distinguished by the process which produces a finer, more regular slurry of cellulose fibers which are pulled out of solution by a screen and dried to form sheets or rolls. The earliest paper produced in China consisted of bast fibers from the paper mulberry (kozo) plant along with hemp rag and net scraps. By the 6th century, the mulberry tree was domesticated by farmers in China specifically for the purpose of producing pulp to be used in the papermaking process. In addition to mulberry, pulp was also made from bamboo, hibiscus bark, blue sandalwood, straw, and cotton. Papermaking using pulp made from hemp and linen fibers from tattered clothing, fishing nets and fabric bags spread to Europe in the 13th century, with an ever-increasing use of rags being central to the manufacture and affordability of rag paper, a factor in the development of printing. By the 1800s, production demands on the newly industrialized papermaking and printing industries led to a shift in raw materials, most notably the use of pulpwood and other tree products which today make up more than 95% of global pulp production.
The use of wood pulp and the invention of automatic paper machines in the late 18th- and early 19th-century contributed to paper&#x27;s status as an inexpensive commodity in modern times. While some of the earliest examples of paper made from wood pulp include works published by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1765 and Matthias Koops in 1800, large-scale wood paper production began in the 1840s with unique, simultaneous developments in mechanical pulping made by Friedrich Gottlob Keller in Germany and by Charles Fenerty in Nova Scotia. Chemical processes quickly followed, first with J. Roth&#x27;s use of sulfurous acid to treat wood, then by Benjamin Tilghman&#x27;s U.S. patent on the use of calcium bisulfite, Ca(HSO3)2, to pulp wood in 1867. Almost a decade later, the first commercial sulfite pulp mill was built, in Sweden. It used magnesium as the counter ion and was based on work by Carl Daniel Ekman. By 1900, sulfite pulping had become the dominant means of producing wood pulp, surpassing mechanical pulping methods. The competing chemical pulping process, the sulfate, or kraft, process, was developed by Carl F. Dahl in 1879; the first kraft mill started, in Sweden, in 1890. The invention of the recovery boiler, by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s, allowed kraft mills to recycle almost all of their pulping chemicals. This, along with the ability of the kraft process to accept a wider variety of types of wood and to produce stronger fibres, made the kraft process the dominant pulping process, starting in the 1940s.

Global production of wood pulp in 2006 was 175 million tons (160 million tonnes). In the previous year, 63 million tons (57 million tonnes) of market pulp (not made into paper in the same facility) was sold, with Canada being the largest source at 21 percent of the total, followed by the United States at 16 percent. The wood fiber sources required for pulping are &quot;45% sawmill residue, 21% logs and chips, and 34% recycled paper&quot; (Canada, 2014). Chemical pulp made up 93% of market pulp.

==Wood pulp==

The timber resources used to make wood pulp are referred to as pulpwood. While in theory any tree can be used for pulp-making, coniferous trees are preferred because the cellulose fibers in the pulp of these species are longer, and therefore make stronger paper.
Some of the most commonly used trees for paper making include softwoods such as spruce, pine, fir, larch and hemlock, and hardwoods such as eucalyptus, aspen and birch. There is also increasing interest in genetically modified tree species (such as GM eucalyptus and GM poplar) because of several major benefits these can provide, such as increased ease of breaking down lignin and increased growth rate.

A pulp mill is a manufacturing facility that converts wood chips or other plant fibre source into a thick fiberboard which can be shipped to a paper mill for further processing. Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.

Wood and other plant materials used to make pulp contain three main components (apart from water): cellulose fibers (desired for papermaking), lignin (a three-dimensional polymer that binds the cellulose fibres together) and hemicelluloses (shorter branched carbohydrate polymers). The aim of pulping is to break down the bulk structure of the fibre source, be it chips, stems or other plant parts, into the constituent fibres.

Chemical pulping achieves this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules which can be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical pulping (RMP), physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. There are a number of related hybrid pulping methods that use a combination of chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping, also known as TMP, and chemithermomechanical pulping, also known as CTMP. The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.

=== Harvesting trees ===

Most pulp mills use good forest management practices in harvesting trees to ensure that they have a sustainable source of raw materials &quot;citation required&quot;. One of the major complaints about harvesting wood for pulp mills is that it reduces the biodiversity of the harvested forest. Pulp tree plantations account for 16 percent of world pulp production, old-growth forests 9 percent, and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the rest. Reforestation is practiced in most areas, so trees are a renewable resource. The FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative), PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), and other bodies certify paper made from trees harvested according to guidelines meant to ensure good forestry practices.

The number of trees consumed depends on whether mechanical processes or chemical processes are used. It has been estimated that based on a mixture of softwoods and hardwoods 12 metres (40 ft) tall and 15–20 centimetres (6–8 in) in diameter, it would take an average of 24 trees to produce 0.9 tonne (1 ton) of printing and writing paper, using the kraft process (chemical pulping). Mechanical pulping is about twice as efficient in using trees, since almost all of the wood is used to make fibre, therefore it takes about 12 trees to make 0.9 tonne (1 ton) of mechanical pulp or newsprint.

There are roughly two short tons in a cord of wood.

===Preparation for pulping===

Wood chipping is the act and industry of chipping wood for pulp, but also for other processed wood products and mulch. Only the heartwood and sapwood are useful for making pulp. Bark contains relatively few useful fibers and is removed and used as fuel to provide steam for use in the pulp mill. Most pulping processes require that the wood be chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips.

===Pulping===
There are a number of different processes which can be used to separate the wood fiber:

====Mechanical pulp====

Manufactured grindstones with embedded silicon carbide or aluminum oxide can be used to grind small wood logs called &quot;bolts&quot; to make stone pulp (SGW). If the wood is steamed prior to grinding it is known as pressure ground wood pulp (PGW). Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) and if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called thermomechanical pulp (TMP). Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibres. Mechanical pulps are used for products that require less strength, such as newsprint and paperboards.

====Thermomechanical pulp====
Thermomechanical pulp is pulp produced by processing wood chips using heat (thus &quot;&quot;) and a mechanical refining movement (thus &quot;-mechanical&quot;). It is a two-stage process where the logs are first stripped of their bark and converted into small chips. These chips have a moisture content of around 25–30 percent. A mechanical force is applied to the wood chips in a crushing or grinding action which generates heat and water vapour and softens the lignin thus separating the individual fibres. The pulp is then screened and cleaned, any clumps of fibre are reprocessed. This process gives a high yield of fibre from the timber (around 95 percent) and as the lignin has not been removed, the fibres are hard and rigid.

====Chemi-thermomechanical pulp====
Wood chips can be pre-treated with sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfate and other chemicals prior to refining with equipment similar to a mechanical mill. The conditions of the chemical treatment are much less vigorous (lower temperature, shorter time, less extreme pH) than in a chemical pulping process since the goal is to make the fibers easier to refine, not to remove lignin as in a fully chemical process. Pulps made using these hybrid processes are known as chemi-thermomechanical pulps (CTMP).

====Chemical pulp====

Chemical pulp is produced by combining wood chips and chemicals in large vessels called digesters. There, heat and chemicals break down lignin, which binds cellulose fibres together, without seriously degrading the cellulose fibres. Chemical pulp is used for materials that need to be stronger or combined with mechanical pulps to give a product different characteristics. The kraft process is the dominant chemical pulping method, with the sulfite process second. Historically soda pulping was the first successful chemical pulping method.

====Recycled pulp====

Recycled pulp is also called deinked pulp (DIP). DIP is recycled paper which has been processed by chemicals, thus removing printing inks and other unwanted elements and freed the paper fibres. The process is called deinking.

DIP is used as raw material in papermaking. Many newsprint, toilet paper and facial tissue grades commonly contain 100 percent deinked pulp and in many other grades, such as lightweight coated for offset and printing and writing papers for office and home use, DIP makes up a substantial proportion of the furnish.

====Organosolv pulping====

Organosolv pulping uses organic solvents at temperatures above 140 °C to break down lignin and hemicellulose into soluble fragments. The pulping liquor is easily recovered by distillation. The reason for using a solvent is to make the lignin more soluble in the cooking liquor. Most common used solvents are methanol, ethanol, formic acid and acetic acid often in combination with water.

====Alternative pulping methods====
Research is under way to develop biopulping (biological pulping), similar to chemical pulping but using certain species of fungi that are able to break down the unwanted lignin, but not the cellulose fibres. In the biopulping process, the fungal enzyme lignin peroxidase selectively digests lignin to leave remaining cellulose fibres. This could have major environmental benefits in reducing the pollution associated with chemical pulping. The pulp is bleached using chlorine dioxide stage followed by neutralization and calcium hypochlorite. The oxidizing agent in either case oxidizes and destroys the dyes formed from the tannins of the wood and accentuated (reinforced) by sulfides present in it.

Steam exploded fibre is a pulping and extraction technique that has been applied to wood and other fibrous organic material.

===Bleaching===

The pulp produced up to this point in the process can be bleached to produce a white paper product. The chemicals used to bleach pulp have been a source of environmental concern, and recently the pulp industry has been using alternatives to chlorine, such as chlorine dioxide, oxygen, ozone and hydrogen peroxide.

== Alternatives to wood pulp ==

Pulp made from non-wood plant sources or recycled textiles is manufactured today largely as a speciality product for fine-printing and art purposes. Modern machine- and hand-made art papers made with cotton, linen, hemp, abaca, kozo, and other fibers are often valued for their longer, stronger fibers and their lower lignin content. Lignin, present in virtually all plant materials, contributes to the acidification and eventual breakdown of paper products, often characterized by the browning and embrittling of paper with a high lignin content such as newsprint. 100% cotton or a combination of cotton and linen pulp is widely used to produce documents intended for long-term use, such as certificates, currency, and passports.

Today, some groups advocate using field crop fibre or agricultural residues instead of wood fibre as a more sustainable means of production.

There is enough straw to meet much of North America&#x27;s book, magazine, catalogue and copy paper needs. Agricultural-based paper does not come from tree farms. Some agricultural residue pulps take less time to cook than wood pulps. That means agricultural-based paper uses less energy, less water and fewer chemicals. Pulp made from wheat and flax straw has half the ecological footprint of pulp made from forests.

Hemp paper is a possible replacement, but processing infrastructure, storage costs and the low usability percentage of the plant means it is not a ready substitute.

However, wood is also a renewable resource, with about 90 percent of pulp coming from plantations or reforested areas. Non-wood fibre sources account for about 5–10 percent of global pulp production, for a variety of reasons, including seasonal availability, problems with chemical recovery, brightness of the pulp etc. In China, as of 2009, a higher proportion of non-wood pulp processing increased use of water and energy.

Nonwovens are in some applications alternatives to paper made from wood pulp, like filter paper or tea bags.

==Market pulp==
Market pulp is any variety of pulp that is produced in one location, dried and shipped to another location for further processing. Important quality parameters for pulp not directly related to the fibres are brightness, dirt levels, viscosity and ash content. In 2004 it accounted for about 55 million metric tons of market pulp.

Air dry pulp is the most common form to sell pulp. This is pulp dried to about 10 percent moisture content. It is normally delivered as sheeted bales of 250 kg. The reason to leave 10 percent moisture in the pulp is that this minimizes the fibre to fibre bonding and makes it easier to disperse the pulp in water for further processing to paper.

Roll pulp or &quot;reel pulp&quot; is the most common delivery form of pulp to non traditional pulp markets. Fluff pulp is normally shipped on rolls (reels). This pulp is dried to 5–6 percent moisture content. At the customer this is going to a comminution process to prepare for further processing.

Some pulps are flash dried. This is done by pressing the pulp to about 50 percent moisture content and then let it fall through silos that are 15–17 m high. Gas fired hot air is the normal heat source. The temperature is well above the char point of cellulose, but large amount of moisture in the fibre wall and lumen prevents the fibres from being incinerated. It is often not dried down to 10 percent moisture (air dry). The bales are not as densely packed as air dry pulp.

==Environmental concerns==

The major environmental impacts of producing wood pulp come from its impact on forest sources and from its waste products.

===Forest resources===

The impact of logging to provide the raw material for wood pulp is an area of intense debate. Modern logging practices, using forest management seek to provide a reliable, renewable source of raw materials for pulp mills. The practice of clear cutting is a particularly sensitive issue since it is a very visible effect of logging. Reforestation, the planting of tree seedlings on logged areas, has also been criticized for decreasing biodiversity because reforested areas are monocultures.
Logging of old growth forests accounts for less than 10 percent of wood pulp, but is one of the most controversial issues.

===Effluents from pulp mills===
The process effluents are treated in a biological effluent treatment plant, which guarantees that the effluents are not toxic in the recipient.

Mechanical pulp is not a major cause for environmental concern since most of the organic material is retained in the pulp, and the chemicals used (hydrogen peroxide and sodium dithionite) produce benign byproducts (water and sodium sulfate (finally), respectively).

Chemical pulp mills, especially kraft mills, are energy self-sufficient and very nearly closed cycle with respect to inorganic chemicals.

Bleaching with chlorine produces large amounts of organochlorine compounds, including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Many mills have adopted alternatives to chlorinated bleaching agents thereby reducing emissions of organochlorine pollution.

===Odor problems===
The kraft pulping reaction in particular releases foul-smelling compounds. The sulfide reagent that degrades lignin structure also causes some demethylation, yielding methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. These same compounds are released during many forms of microbial decay, including the internal microbial action in Camembert cheese, although the kraft process is a chemical one and does not involve any microbial degradation. These compounds have extremely low odor thresholds and disagreeable smells.

==Applications==
The main applications for pulp are paper and board production. The furnish of pulps used depends on the quality on the finished paper. Important quality parameters are wood furnish, brightness, viscosity, extractives, dirt count and strength.

Chemical pulps are used for making nanocellulose.

Speciality pulp grades have many other applications. Dissolving pulp is used in making regenerated cellulose that is used textile and cellophane production. It is also used to make cellulose derivatives. Fluff pulp is used in diapers, feminine hygiene products and nonwovens.

===Paper production===

The Fourdrinier Machine is the basis for most modern papermaking, and it has been used in some variation since its conception. It accomplishes all the steps needed to transform pulp into a final paper product.

==Economics==
In 2009, NBSK pulp sold for $650/ton in the United States. The price had dropped due to falling demand when newspapers reduced their size, in part, as a result of the recession. By 2024 this price had recovered to $1315/ton.

<doc id="215848" wikidata="Q6275983" url="?curid=215848" title="Jook-sing">
<text>Jook-sing or zuk-sing (竹升) is a Cantonese term for an overseas Chinese person who was born in the West, or a Chinese person who more readily or strongly identifies with Western culture than traditional Chinese culture.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;jook-sing&quot; evolved from &quot;zuk-gong&quot; (竹杠; &quot;zhugang&quot; in Mandarin) which means a &quot;bamboo pole&quot; or &quot;rod&quot;. Since &quot;gong&quot; (杠) is a Cantonese homophone of the inauspicious word 降 which means &quot;descend&quot; or &quot;downward&quot;, it is replaced with &quot;sing&quot; (升), which means &quot;ascend&quot; or &quot;upward&quot;.

The stem of the bamboo plant is hollow and compartmentalized; thus water poured in one end does not flow out of the other end. The metaphor is that &quot;jook-sings&quot; are not part of either culture; water within the &quot;jook-sing&quot; does not flow and connect to either end. The term may or may not be derogatory. Use of the term predates World War II.

==Modern term==

===North American usage===
In the United States and Canada, the term refers to fully Westernized American-born or Canadian-born Chinese. The term originates from Cantonese slang in the United States. &quot;Jook-sing&quot; persons are categorized as having Western-centric identities, values and culture. The term also refers to similar Chinese individuals in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and New Zealand.

===Related colloquialisms===
*Banana () (referencing the yellow skin and white insides of the fruit when fully matured) and Twinkie (based on the snack produced by American company Hostess - again, it denotes something that is &quot;yellow&quot; on the outside and &quot;white&quot; on the inside); may be used as a pejorative term or as a non-pejorative term.
*FOB (Fresh Off the Boat): antonym of &quot;jook-sing.&quot; Typically meant to indicate a Chinese-born person who propagates excessively Chinese stereotypes while living in the West.

<text>Moody Bible Institute (MBI) is a private evangelical Christian Bible college in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded by evangelist and businessman Dwight Lyman Moody in 1886. Historically, MBI has maintained positions that have identified it as non-charismatic, dispensational, and generally Calvinistic. Today, MBI operates undergraduate programs and Moody Theological Seminary at the Chicago campus. The Seminary also operates a satellite campus in Plymouth, Michigan. Moody Aviation operates a flight school in Spokane, Washington.

== History ==
===20th century===

Emma Dryer organized the &quot;May Institute&quot;, a weekly meeting for prayer and fellowship, with Moody&#x27;s permission in 1883. Participants in the May Institute encouraged Moody to found a school to train young people for evangelism to carry on the Christian revival tradition.

On January 22, 1886, Moody addressed church members: &quot;I tell you what, and what I have on my heart, I believe we have got to have gap-men: men to stand between the laity and the ministers; men who are trained to do city mission work. Take men that have the gifts and train them for the work of reaching the people.&quot; As a result of this meeting, held at Farwell Hall, the group founded the Chicago Evangelization Society for the &quot;education and training of Christian workers, including teachers, ministers, missionaries, and musicians who may completely and effectively proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot; The society was renamed &quot;Moody Bible Institute&quot; after Moody died in 1899.

Before 1900, Moody played a significant role in fund-raising to support MBI. After Moody died, however, the institute struggled financially. James M. Gray, the president of the school, invited Henry Parsons Crowell to financially restructure the institute. Crowell established the school on business principles of productivity and performance. The MBI Executive Committee met nearly every Tuesday for the next 40 years. An administration building took years to complete, but when the building was dedicated there was no mortgage and only $50,000 left to pay.

=== 21st century ===
Since 2012, MBI has received federal financial assistance, which means the religious institution is subject to federal rules, including Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination. After several female students complained of being denied access to the then-male-only pastoral ministry program, the institute changed its policy in 2016. However, communications instructor Janay Garrick, who helped the students file Title IX complaints, found that her employment contract would not be renewed at the end of 2017. MBI argued that her &quot;views on gender equity (which the college was aware of when she was hired) made her incompatible with the school.&quot; As of March 2024, Garrick is pursuing a Title VII sex-discrimination lawsuit against MBI because male colleagues &quot;who shared her egalitarian views and joined her in speaking out against sexism on Moody Bible’s campus faced none of the harassment or retaliation directed at Garrick.&quot; MBI engaged Grand River Solutions to review its Title IX compliance and make recommendations for change.

In November 2017, the institution announced the closure of its campus in Spokane, Washington and reductions in other programs and services in response to continued drops in enrollment. Faculty were distressed by impending job losses, and penned an anonymous letter to the administration in the student newspaper expressing concerns about faculty layoffs when the administration had just committed $22 million for a new campus building. Two months later, both the President and Chief Operating Officer resigned, and the provost retired. In its announcement of these changes, the institution cited &quot;widespread concerns over the direction&quot; of the institution. 

Mark Jobe, founder of the multisite New Life Community Church, became the new president in January 2019. In July 2019, Jobe announced a long-range plan to redevelop portions of Moody&#x27;s campus. Proceeds from the sale of 8.1 acres would be earmarked for campus improvements, scholarships, endowment, and financial reserves. The &quot;North Union&quot; project was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in July 2021 and by the Chicago City Council in October 2022.

== Academics ==

MBI&#x27;s stated mission is to train students for full-time ministry in churches and parachurch organizations. Since 1989, it has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission or its predecessor. It is also accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education and the National Association of Schools of Music.

=== Undergraduate ===

In addition to a Bachelor of Arts degree, which is available in over two dozen fields including theology, the Bible, and ministries of various emphases, MBI offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Biblical Studies, a Bachelor of Science degree in Missionary Aviation Technology, a two-year Associates of Biblical Studies degree (ABS), and a five-year Bachelor of Music degree (BMus) in Sacred Music. Furthermore, non-degree TESOL and Biblical Studies one-year certificates are offered.

=== Graduate ===

The Moody Theological Seminary offers a Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Biblical Studies, and a Master of Counseling/Psychology. A one-year graduate certificate is also offered.
In November 2009, Moody Bible Institute and Michigan Theological Seminary jointly announced plans for Michigan Theological Seminary to merge with Moody Bible Institute&#x27;s Moody Theological Seminary and Graduate School. In January 2010, Michigan Theological Seminary became Moody Theological Seminary–Michigan located in Plymouth, Michigan.

== Media ministries ==

In addition to its educational programs, Moody has two Christian media ministries: Moody Radio and Moody Publishers.

===Moody Publishers===
In 1894, Moody Publishers was founded under the name Bible Institute Colportage Association (BICA). Moody&#x27;s son-in-law, A. P. Fitt, managed BICA operations. Publishing was contracted to Moody&#x27;s brother-in-law, Fleming Revell, and his upstart publishing company. In 1895 the Colportage Library began the publication at regular intervals of books which met five specific criteria: 1. a popular readable style; 2. well-known authors or books of existing reputation; 3. strictly evangelical and nondenominational works; 4. good workmanship, and; 5. low price.

In 1941, BICA became Moody Press.

===Moody Magazine===

In 1900, Moody Bible Institute began publishing a monthly magazine titled &quot;The Institute Tie&quot;. In 1910, it was renamed &quot;The Christian Workers Magazine&quot; to reflect its focus on Sunday school teachers and other Christian workers. Later, it was renamed again, to &quot;Moody Bible Institute Monthly&quot;, then &quot;Moody Monthly&quot;. &quot;Moody&quot; ceased publication in 2003.

===Moody Radio===

In 1926, the Institute expanded its reach beyond education and publishing by sponsoring the first non-commercial Christian radio station in America, WMBI-AM (now WXES). Over time, MBI&#x27;s radio outreach grew to the Moody Broadcasting Network, which now owns and operates 36 commercial-free stations and provides programming via satellite to more than 700 outlets.

<text>LaRon Louis James Sr. (born February 18, 1982), better known by his stage name Juelz Santana, is an American rapper and member of East Coast hip hop group, the Diplomats (also known as Dipset). He is best known for his appearances on group cohort Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s 2002 singles &quot;Oh Boy&quot; and &quot;Hey Ma&quot;, which peaked at numbers four and three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. His guest appearance on Chris Brown&#x27;s 2005 single, &quot;Run It!&quot; peaked atop the chart for five weeks and received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As a lead artist, he is also known for his 2005 single &quot;There It Go (The Whistle Song)&quot;, which peaked at number six on the chart and received platinum certification by the RIAA.

&quot;There It Go&quot; served as lead single for his debut studio album, &quot;From Me to U&quot; (2003), which was met with mixed critical response, along with his second album, &quot;What the Game&#x27;s Been Missing!&quot; (2005). Both released by Def Jam Recordings, the albums peaked within the top ten—at numbers eight and nine, respectively—of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. With Dipset, he has released three albums, and with his spin-off group Skull Gang, he released one studio album (2009). His 2009 single, &quot;Back to the Crib&quot; (featuring Chris Brown) was intended to lead his third album &quot;Born to Lose, Built to Win&quot;, which remains unreleased. His guest performances on Jim Jones and Ron Browz&#x27; 2008 single &quot;Pop Champagne&quot;, and Lloyd Banks&#x27; 2010 single &quot;Beamer, Benz or Bentley&quot; both peaked within the top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as well.

In December 2018, James was sentenced to 27 months in prison for carrying an unconcealed weapon at an airport. He was released early from prison on August 5, 2020 after serving 19 months of his 27-month sentence.

== Early life ==
James was born in New York City to African American parents. He was raised in the Sugar Hill, Harlem section of Manhattan and began rapping at the age of five. He cites a live-in Dominican godmother as a strong influence on his early upbringing.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings (1994–2001) ===
At 12, James formed the rap duo, Draftpick, with Malik, a neighborhood friend. The group first gained recognition after several performances around New York City, including Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater, where they won two weeks in a row. The two got signed to Priority Records when James was 15 years old. They released one single on the label, &quot;Play Ruff&quot;, with Memphis Bleek and Tracey Lee.

In 1998, James was introduced to Cam&#x27;ron through his cousin, and shortly thereafter, took on the name Juelz Santana and became a member of his hip hop collective, The Diplomats, alongside Jim Jones and Freekey Zekey. Santana&#x27;s first collaboration with the group was the Trackmasters remix of &quot;What Means the World to You&quot;, followed by the tracks &quot;Double Up&quot; and &quot;All the Chickens&quot;, on Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;S.D.E.&quot;, released on September 19, 2000, through Epic Records.

=== &quot;From Me to U&quot; (2002–2003) ===
In 2001, Cam&#x27;ron signed to Roc-a-Fella Records and released his third studio album, &quot;Come Home with Me&quot;, on May 14, 2002, which featured further collaborations with Santana, including &quot;Welcome to New York City&quot;, &quot;Hey Ma&quot; and &quot;Oh Boy&quot;, which earned Santana his first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 2003 Grammy Awards.

Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s signing also led to Santana signing a deal with Roc-a-Fella, under the imprint Diplomat Records. After four mixtapes, the group released their first album on &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; on March 25, 2003, which debuted at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 92,000 copies in its first week and eventually being certified Gold by the RIAA. Santana caused a minor controversy before the album&#x27;s release when he described himself as a &quot;young Mohammed Atta&quot; on a leaked version of the track &quot;I Love You&quot;, just months after the September 11 attacks. In a retrospective, Complex named the album one of the classic albums of the decade.

On August 19, 2003, Santana released his debut album, &quot;From Me to U&quot;, which peaked at number 8 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was preceded by the mixtape, &quot;Final Destination&quot;, released on June 17, 2003, and the single &quot;Dipset (Santana&#x27;s Town)&quot;, which peaked at number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, received a nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 46th Grammy Awards.

=== &quot;What the Game&#x27;s Been Missing!&quot; (2004–2006) ===

Following disputes at the label between Cam&#x27;ron and Roc-A-Fella Records head Jay-Z, the Diplomats severed ties with Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam and signed to independent label Koch Records. The group released their second album, &quot;Diplomatic Immunity 2&quot;, on November 23, 2004, with new members Hell Rell, 40 Cal., and J. R. Writer.

On December 23, 2004, Santana released &quot;Mic Check&quot;, the lead single from his sophomore album. The single peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In April 2005, Santana announced that he had returned to Def Jam and signed a new joint-venture deal with them. On May 29, 2005, Santana released the album second single, &quot;There It Go (The Whistle Song)&quot;, which became his highest-charting single to date, peaking at number 6 on the Hot 100 and number 3 on the Hot Rap tracks charts. A third single, &quot;Oh Yes&quot;, reached number 56 on the Hot 100 and number 8 on the Rap charts, and a fourth, &quot;Clockwork&quot; peaked at number 68. On June 30, 2005, Santana was featured on Chris Brown&#x27;s &quot;Run It!&quot;, which went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five weeks.

On November 22, 2005, Santana released &quot;What the Game&#x27;s Been Missing!&quot;, his second album. Both the album and the single &quot;There It Go&quot; were certified Gold by the RIAA.

=== Unreleased &quot;Born to Lose, Built to Win&quot; album, &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot; appearances (2007–2016) ===
In 2007, rifts and disagreements between the various Dipset members was beyond repair and the group disbanded. In August 2008, it was reported that Cam&#x27;ron had sold his contract to Def Jam for $2 million USD, leaving Santana to form the hip hop collective Skull Gang and label imprint Skull Gang Entertainment. The group released the mixtapes &quot;Takeover&quot; on September 19, 2008, and the Christmas-themed &quot;A Tribute to Bad Santa Starring Mike Epps&quot; with Jim Jones on November 25, 2008, before their debut album, &quot;Skull Gang&quot;, was released on May 5, 2009.

In 2008, Santana began working on his third album, &quot;Born to Lose, Built to Win&quot;. Despite several single releases, including 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Second Coming&quot; with Just Blaze, 2009&#x27;s &quot;Mixin&#x27; Up the Medicine&quot; with Yelawolf and &quot;Back to the Crib&quot; with Chris Brown, the album was never released. During this time, Juelz&#x27; contributions to Lil Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; led to his third Grammy Award nomination, Album of the Year at the 2009 Grammy Awards.

In April 2010, Cam&#x27;ron and Jim Jones officially announced the end of their feud, and the Diplomats reunited for several singles after signing with Interscope Records. In 2011 and 2012, Santana made brief appearances on the first two seasons of VH1 reality series &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot;, alongside other Dipset group members and their significant others.

On December 21, 2012, Santana announced the release of the mixtape &quot;God Will&#x27;n&quot;, his first solo project in eight years. It was released on January 14, 2013, with &quot;XXL&quot; later naming it the 9th best mixtape of the year. It was preceded by the singles &quot;Bodies&quot; featuring Lil Reese, and &quot;Soft&quot; featuring Fabolous, Rick Ross and Meek Mill. Santana also released music videos for &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; featuring Future, &quot;Awesome&quot; featuring Wale, and &quot;Everything Is Good&quot; featuring Wiz Khalifa, saying that he had shot music videos for every song on the tape. A month later, Santana announced his collaboration with Queens-based clothing brand collective, S.B.O.E (Slow Bucks Over Everything), with the release of the mixtape &quot;All We Got Is Us&quot;.

In November 2016, Santana joined the supporting cast of &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot; in its seventh season, releasing the freestyle &quot;Up In The Studio Gettin Blown&quot;.

=== Dipset reunion and &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot; comeback (2017–present) ===
On November 21, 2017, Santana, Cam&#x27;ron, Jim Jones and Freekey Zekey reunited onstage for a performance at the Hammerstein Ballroom. In 2018, the group went on a national tour, &quot;Dipset Forever&quot;, and released their third album, &quot;Diplomatic Ties&quot; on November 22, 2018.

In November 2018, Santana returned to &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot; as a main cast member for its ninth season, which chronicled his ongoing legal struggles.

== Personal life ==
On November 23, 2018, Santana proposed to urban model and video vixen Kimbella Vanderhee during the Diplomats show at the Apollo Theater. They married on January 10, 2019, and separated in December 2022.

Santana and Vanderhee were in an on-again, off-again relationship since 2009 and have three children together, Juelz James, Bella Monroe James, and Santana James. Santana also has a son from a previous relationship, LaRon Jr., born in 2003.

=== Legal issues ===
In January 2011, Santana&#x27;s recording studio in Bergenfield, New Jersey, was raided after a 10-month investigation by the Bergen County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and Gang Unit. They discovered two loaded 9 mm handguns, boxes of ammunition and 84 grams of marijuana.

On February 2, 2011, Santana was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm, possession of a handgun without a permit, possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school. On March 22, 2011, Santana missed a performance at Chris Brown&#x27;s record release party when he was stopped and searched by police. In November 2011 he was charged with making terrorist threats and disorderly conduct.

In March 2018, Santana fled Newark Liberty International Airport, leaving his passport, identification and luggage behind after Transportation Security Administration Officers examining his carry-on luggage found a loaded .38-caliber handgun inside of his bag, as well as eight oxycodone pills. After going on the run for three days, Santana turned himself into the custody of the Port Authority Police Department on March 12. On March 26, Santana was denied bail.

Santana was released from custody on April 6, 2018, when his mother posted $500,000 bail after putting her house up. He was ordered to remain in the custody of his mother and remained on house arrest at his mother&#x27;s residence in New Jersey while he awaited a federal trial. He was later allowed to travel and perform with the rest of The Diplomats on their 2018 reunion tour, under the condition that his mother accompanied him at all times. On December 18, Santana was sentenced to 27 months in prison followed by one year of supervised release. Santana began serving his sentence at the medium security FCI Petersburg in Hopewell, Virginia on March 1, 2019. Santana was released from prison early on August 5, 2020, after serving 19 months of his 27-month sentence.

<doc id="215851" wikidata="Q1137230" url="?curid=215851" title="Country Music Association">
<text>The Country Music Association (CMA) is an American trade association with the stated aim of promoting and developing country music throughout the world. Founded in 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee, it originally consisted of 233 members and was the first trade organization formed to promote a music genre. The CMA is best known for its annual CMA Fest and Country Music Association Awards broadcast live on network television each fall (usually October or November).

== About ==
Initially, CMA&#x27;s Board of Directors included nine directors and five officers. Wesley Rose, president of Acuff-Rose Publishing, Inc., served as CMA&#x27;s first chairman of the board. Broadcasting entrepreneur and executive Connie B. Gay was the founding president. Mac Wiseman served as its first secretary and was also the CMA&#x27;s last surviving inaugural member. The CMA was founded, in part, because of widespread dismay on Music Row about the rise of rock and roll and its influence on country music.

Originally there were nine individual membership categories. The current 15 categories represent all facets of the music industry. Organizational memberships are also available. CMA membership is composed of those persons or organizations that are involved in Country Music, directly and substantially.

Harry Stone served as the first executive director from 1958 to 1960 before resigning. Jo Walker-Meador, the first full-time employee of the CMA, replaced Stone as executive director in 1962 and served until 1991.

The first CMA Awards ceremony was held in 1967 in Nashville. Sonny James and Bobbie Gentry hosted the event, which was not televised. The winner of the first &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; award was singer Eddy Arnold. &quot;Male Vocalist of the Year&quot; went to Jack Greene and &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; to Loretta Lynn.

In 1968, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans hosted the awards, which were presented at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. (The ceremony was filmed and televised on NBC a few weeks later.) The first live telecast of the show was in 1969.

Annual awards are given in the following twelve categories: Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, New Artist of the Year (formerly the Horizon Award), Vocal Group, Vocal Duo, Single, Album, Song, Music Event, Music Video, and Musician.

The CMA also gives a &quot;CMA Broadcast Award&quot; to country-formatted radio stations each year. Broadcast Awards are segmented based on market size, major market (Arbitron Ranking 1–25), large market (Arbitron Ranking 26–50), medium market (Arbitron Ranking 51–100), and small market (All other Markets). A single station cannot win the award in consecutive years.

In honor of the CMA Awards 50th anniversary, MCA Nashville released a song called &quot;Forever Country&quot;.

In 2017, days before the 51st Annual Country Music Association Awards, the association announced that reporters that covered “the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like” at the awards show would have their credentials revoked. Following criticism from Brad Paisley, journalists, and others, the association apologized and rescinded the restrictions on the press.

In June 2021, the CMA announced that they would extend its broadcast contract with ABC through 2026.

== List of CMA Award winners ==
== Events ==
The cornerstone of the CMA is &quot;Country Music&#x27;s Biggest Week&quot;, which includes the aforementioned CMA Awards in early November.

===&quot;CMA Country Christmas&quot;===
&quot;CMA Country Christmas&quot; is a holiday concert event featuring holiday songs performed by country artists. The concert is usually not aired live, as it is re-edited for later broadcast by CMA broadcast partner ABC.

===CMA Fest===
The CMA Fest, the longest-running Country Music festival in the world, takes place in downtown Nashville, TN every summer. Hundreds of thousands of fans flock to listen to hundreds of artists perform on 11+ stages. All day long fans have a chance to meet their favorite country music artists at Fan Fair X. The four days of events are later re-edited into a three-hour TV special, also aired on ABC during the summer months.

<doc id="215853" wikidata="Q7900199" url="?curid=215853" title="Urbana (conference)">
<text>Urbana is a major Christian student missions conference sponsored by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. The event is designed to inform Christian students about global issues and issues around the world and missional living. The conference also encourages students to explore the biblical mandate for cross-cultural missions and encourages them to participate in missions.

Each Urbana lasts for 4-5 days at the end of December and on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In addition to the main speakers and sessions, participants are offered a choice of seminars, relating to specific topics within the general theme of the university and international missions. Group Bible study is an intentional part of the daily conference schedule. Worship is also a major highlight of the convention; special attention is paid to incorporating diverse worship styles, even including songs in foreign languages. Opportunities for coaching and receiving prayer are also a part of Urbana.

The first/precursor “Urbana” Student Missions Convention was held in 1946 in Toronto, and since then, it has generally been held every three years. From 1948 to 2003, Urbana took place at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, with the primary venue after 1963 being the Assembly Hall (now State Farm Center), the school&#x27;s basketball arena.

== Conference Elements ==

Each conference is filled with a variety of activities and seminars for students to engage in. Highlights include an exhibit hall in which students are encouraged to network with leaders from missions organizations and seminaries. Each morning and evening all participates gather in the main session room to hear from engaging and relevant world Bible expositors and mission speakers and to worship, with a focus specifically on multi-ethnic and global worship. The conference concludes with the conference participants welcoming in the New Year. Students are also encouraged to participate in a variety of seminars and &quot;tracks&quot;, which specialize in specific topics. For example, past topics are known to include Business and technology, global issues, healthcare, justice, evangelism, and world religions. In addition to the main sessions and seminars, students participate in Bible Studies, and have the opportunity to sign up for prayer and coaching sessions.

==History==

=== 1940s ===
The first Urbana was held in 1946 at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 151 colleges, universities, and seminaries from across North America were represented, along with 100 missionaries. L. E. Maxwell, president of Prairie Bible Institute, and other noted Christian leaders in academia spoke at the December event. The second Urbana was held in 1948, this time at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Jim Elliot, known for his missionary work and martyrdom in Ecuador, attended this Urbana as a student. The slogan for this Urbana was &quot;From Every Campus to Every Country.&quot; 1,300 students from 154 campuses participated. Speakers included Frank Houghton, V. Raymond Edman, and Billy Graham.

=== 1950s ===
The 1954 Urbana had the theme &quot;Changing World; Changeless Christ&quot; and hosted 2,000 students from 263 schools. A. W. Tozer, who preached on Bible characters, and Alan Redpath were among those who spoke at this Urbana. The number of students attending Urbana grew to 3,500 in 1957, and the theme that year was &quot;One Lord—One Church—One World.&quot; Billy Graham returned to speak at this conference, and was joined by the likes of Donald Barnhouse and Harold Ockenga. Urbana 57 was held in a gymnasium with poor acoustics, and with the University of Illinois set to finish building a new assembly room by 1961, the next Urbana was postponed.

=== 1960s ===
Urbana 61 had a change in format from previous conferences. It featured a &quot;plenary panel&quot; about mission work, a &quot;plenary forum&quot; that involved a question-and-answer time with various Christian leaders, elective courses on specific topics related to missions, missionary sessions, and a pastoral group. The theme was &quot;Commission—Conflict—Commitment.&quot; 5,400 students participated in this conference. Eugene Nida, Arthur Glasser, and Urbana veterans David Howard Adeney and Billy Graham were speakers. Festo Kivengere preached on Jacob and Esau.

=== 1970s ===
Urbana 70&#x27;s theme was &quot;World Evangelism: Why? How? Who?&quot; and included speakers John Stott, David Howard, Leighton Ford, Byang Kato, Samuel Kamelson, and Tom Skinner. Urbana 76 was themed &quot;Declare His Glory Among the Nations.&quot; John Stott spoke on the biblical basis for mission, Elisabeth Elliot on the will of God, and Helen Roseveare on Declaring His Glory in Suffering. 17,000 students participated in 1,700 small groups, meeting each morning for Bible study and every evening for prayer. &quot;That All Nations Might Believe and Obey Jesus Christ&quot; was the theme for Urbana 79. Many speakers made repeat appearances, including John Stott, Billy Graham, and Elisabeth Elliot. Joining them were Luis Palau, David Howard Adeney, and others. Urbana 79 experienced capacity issues due to so many students wanting to attend that the next conference would be held just two years later.

=== 1980s ===
Urbana 81 was themed &quot;Let Every Tongue Confess That Jesus Christ Is Lord&quot; and 14,000 attended. One unusual characteristic of this Urbana was that it came only two years after the previous one. Speakers included Wycliffe Bible translator Ed Beach, Eric Alexander from a church in Scotland, Gordon MacDonald, Isabelo Magalit, Marilyn Laszlo, Billy Graham, George McKinney, and author Rebecca Manley Pippert.

Urbana 84 attracted 18,000 participants. Eric Alexander spoke on the conference theme &quot;Faithful in Christ Jesus&quot; from the book of Ephesians. Other notable speakers: Ada Lum, Billy Graham, Cliffe Knechtle, David Bryant, George McKinney, Joanne Shetler, John Kyle, Luis Palau, Mariano DiGangi, Ray Bakke, and Tokunboh Adayemo.

Urbana 87 took its theme from the Book of Jonah: &quot;Should I not be concerned?&quot; Nearly 19,000 participants came to hear Harvie Conn, Ray Bakke, Floyd McClung, Billy Graham, Helen Roseveare, Rebecca Manley Pippert, Roberta Hestenes, and Tony Campolo. Nearly 6,000 attendees indicated they felt they were being called by God to serve in overseas missions.

=== 1990s ===
Throughout the 90s, Urbana was hosted at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, but the large numbers in attendance meant that the conference was pushing that venue&#x27;s capacity. In these years, the conference was updated in significant ways.

Urbana 90 was InterVarsity&#x27;s 16th triennial student mission convention, was themed &quot;Jesus Christ: Lord of the Universe, Hope of the World.&quot; Almost 20,000 people met December 27–31, 1990. Featured speakers included Joni Eareckson Tada, Ada Lum, Ajith Fernando, Caesar Molebatsi, George Otis, Glandion Carney, Isaac Canales, Luis Bush, M. Fisher, Paul Tokunaga, Peter Kuzmic and Philemon Choi. It was the first Urbana featuring a full &#x27;contemporary&#x27; worship band and a prayer ministry team composed of campus staff members.

Urbana 93 (entitled &quot;God So Loves the World&quot;) attracted over 17,000 attendees. Featured speakers included Neil Anderson, Lindsay Brown, Isaac Canales, Peter Cha, Margarita Petrovna Dvorzhetskaya, Ajith Fernando, Mary Fisher, Steve Hayner, and David Zac Niringiye. Bruce Kuhn offered dramatic presentations of Bible passages.

Urbana 96 (entitled &quot;You Are My Witnesses&quot;) was the 50th anniversary of Urbana (counting back to the original InterVarsity student mission convention in Toronto in 1946). Over 19,600 were in attendance, making it the largest student missions gathering in the world. Featured speakers: Tokunboh Adeyemo, Rebecca Atallah, Jorge Atiencia, Robbie Castleman, Alex Gee, Steve Hayner, Jacqueline Huggins, Daniel Oh, Mac Pier, T.V. Thomas, and George Verwer. Bruce Kuhn returned to offer dramatic enactments of Scripture.

=== 2000s ===
Urbana 2000, InterVarsity&#x27;s 19th triennial student missions convention (themed &quot;Because God First Loved Us&quot;), was an unusual Urbana in that it was scheduled four years (vesrus the traditional three) after the previous conference, to avoid possible Y2K complications. Over 20,000 participated. Featured speakers included: Vinoth Ramachandra, Ken Fong, Steve Hayner, George Verwer, Jimmy McGee, Paul Borthwick, Marta Bennett, Barney Ford, and Alex Gee. Over 5,000 committed their lives to cross-cultural missions as their vocation.

The last Urbana to be held at UIUC, Urbana 2003, was also the first to offer an &quot;International Student Track&quot;, providing special housing options and electives to international students interested in spending time with other students from their respective countries. Urbana 06 again held a track for international students, as well as tracks that focused on the global HIV–AIDS pandemic, the growing business as mission movement, and the needs of the world&#x27;s largest slum communities in the developing world. Tracks at Urbana 09 included International Students, Arts and Media, Advocacy and Poverty, Business as Mission, Evangelism, Jesus and Justice, The Mission of Healthcare, and The Church Around the World.

The 2000s marked the move of Urbana from its long-time home at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign to St. Louis in 2006—a much larger venue for a conference that seemed to be maxing out every year. The new venue allowed nearly all of the convention to be held under one roof, with students staying in different hotels within the city and walking or transiting to the conference. 

At Urbana 2006, nearly 22,500 participants attended. Urbana 06 speakers included Rick Warren, pastor and author of &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot;; Ray Bakke, a professor and specialist in urban ministry; Bono from the band U2 (via video); and Ajith Fernando, a well-respected Bible teacher who is the director of Youth for Christ in Sri Lanka.

Urbana 09 speakers included Ramez Atallah, General Secretary of the Bible Society of Egypt; Shane Claiborne of The Simple Way in Philadelphia; Ruth Padilla DeBorst, General Secretary of the Latin American Theological Fellowship; Sunder Krishnan, Senior Pastor of the Rexdale Alliance Church in Ontario, Canada; and Patrick Fung, General Director of OMF International. Oscar Muriu, Senior Pastor of Nairobi Chapel, Nairobi, Kenya, spoke at both Urbana 06 and Urbana 09. Worship at Urbana 09 was led by Sandra Maria Van Opstal.

=== 2010s ===
Urbana 12 speakers included Calisto Odede, David Platt, Chai Ling, Daniel Bourdanne, Ziel Machado, Geri Rodman, Terry LeBlanc, and featured a performance by Andy Mineo. Sandra Maria Van Opstal led worship again with a focus on the integration of multiethnic worship and mission. Urbana 12 also partnered with World Vision to include a Caregiver Kit Build: the 15,000 attendees assembled 32,000 Caregiver Kits which were then shipped to volunteer caregivers who work with AIDS patients in Swaziland and other African countries.

Urbana 15’s theme was “Find Your Life” and focused on the book of Matthew. Speakers included Francis Chan, David Platt, Evelyne Reisacher, Michelle Higgins, MaryKate Morse, Allan Matamoros, and Christena Cleveland. Worship was directed by Erna Kim Hackett.

&quot;Faithful Witness” was the theme of Urbana 18, taken from the book of Revelation, and speakers included René Breuel, John Inazu, Dominique Gilliard, Beth Paz, and Anne Zaki. Worship was directed by Eric Lige.

=== 2020s ===
Urbana 21 was postponed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Urbana 22 took place in Indianapolis, IN with the theme of “Rise Up” and a focus on the book of Acts. Speakers included Bishop Claude Alexander, Alexia Salvatierra, Michele Lee, James Choung, Alejandra Ortiz, Michael Oh, and Richmond Wandera. 

Urbana 25 will take place from December 28, 2025 through New Year’s Eve in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Early life and career==
Born in Chiba, Japan, he first came to public attention as an editor of &quot;Puff&quot; magazine, his first job after completing high school. Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist Tatsuya Egawa in the production of the &quot;Making Be Free!&quot; manga, and in 1986 began his first original manga series &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot;. His second manga series &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;, also translated as &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot;, is Fujishima&#x27;s most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the &quot;Tales&quot; series and &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;.

===Personal life===
On June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page. Both of them had known each other on Twitter approximately since 2014.

On July 7, 2016, Fujishima confirmed the marriage on his Twitter account.

<doc id="215861" wikidata="Q5251296" url="?curid=215861" title="Defence of property">
<text>The defence of property is a common method of justification used by defendants who argue that they should not be held liable for any loss and injury that they have caused because they were acting to protect their property.

==English law==
Generally, see self-defence in English law. In addition to the right of self-defence at common law, section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 states that
:A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime or in arresting offenders or suspects.

Insofar as an attack on property is a crime, reasonable force may be used to prevent the crime or to arrest the offender, whether it be theft of a sum of money or the damage of an object. In many cases of robbery and burglary, the threat will be to both a person and property, and this combination can be a powerful defence. In &quot;AG&#x27;s Reference (No 2 of 1983)&quot; (1984) 1 AER 988 Lane CJ. held that a defendant who manufactured ten petrol bombs to defend his shop during the Toxteth Riots could set up the defence of showing that he possessed an explosive substance &quot;for a lawful purpose&quot; if he could show he acted to protect himself or his family or property by means he believed reasonably necessary to meet the attack. In theory, the defence of property by itself cannot reasonably provide a justification for inflicting serious injury, but there are a number of cases approving considerable violence to arrest criminals threatening property.

Although &quot;R v Scully&quot; (1824) 171 ER 1213 held that it was not justifiable to shoot an intruder merely to arrest him, on the facts, &quot;the life of the prisoner was threatened, and if he considered his life in actual danger, he was justified in shooting the deceased as he had done; but if, not considering his own life in danger, he rashly shot this man, who was only a trespasser, he would be guilty of manslaughter.&quot; See self-defence (Australia) for a comparative view on whether the use of excessive force causing death should give rise to a mitigatory defence and &quot;Reform&quot; below. In &quot;Mead and Belt&#x27;s Case&quot; (1823) 68 ER 1006. Holroyd J. instructed a jury that violence could not be used against a civil trespasser, adding: &quot;But, the making an attack upon a dwelling, and especially at night, the law regards as equivalent to an assault on a man&#x27;s person; for a man&#x27;s house is his castle and therefore, in the eye of the law, it is equivalent to an assault.&quot;

One recent case on using force against a burglar is &quot;Anthony Martin v R&quot; (2001) EWCA 2245, which resulted in the householder being convicted. As the law currently stands, a person in possession can use no more force than they reasonably believe necessary to remove a trespasser from the premises. Further, where the threat to the land or its possession is not immediate, and other measures could be taken that would make force unnecessary (e.g., calling the police or seeking remedies through the courts) the defence will normally be lost. 

But in &quot;Chamberlain v Lindon&quot; (1998) 1 WLR 1252, Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right-of-way, honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of protecting his property (and, incidentally, avoiding litigation). It was held that it was not necessary to decide whether Lindon&#x27;s action was justified as a matter of civil law. For the purpose of the criminal law, what mattered was whether Lindon believed that his actions were reasonable. Although this case is on the specific interpretation of the statutory defence under §5 Criminal Damage Act 1971, the fact that the defendant was not &quot;out of time&quot; after nine months of inaction is interesting. On a similar statutory defence, &quot;DPP v Bayer and Others&quot; (2004) 1 Cr. App. R. 493 dealt with defence of private property as a defence to aggravated trespass under section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

The court held that if defendants argued they had used reasonable force to defend property from actual or imminent damage that would constitute a criminal act, then the court had to consider whether, on the facts as the defendants honestly believed them to be, the force used was reasonable in all the circumstances.

==Reform==

The defence of &quot;private defence&quot; or &quot;protective force,&quot; when unlawful force is used or threatened against a person who may use proportionate force to defend persons or property, is distinguished from the line of authority concerned with a similar defence against trespassers. In the Law Commission&#x27;s Report No. 218 &quot;Offences Against the Person and General Principles&quot; (1993) at pp. 106–110) these defences are set out (so far as they relate to defence of property) as follows:
:27(i) The use of force by a person for any of the following purposes, if only such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he believes them to be, does not constitute an offence:
::(c) to protect his property... from trespass;
::(d) to protect property belonging to another from . . . damage caused by a criminal act or (with the authority of the other) from trespass...
:29(i) For the purposes of s 27...
::(a) a person uses force in relation to... property not only where he applies force to, but also where he causes an impact on... that property;&quot;

<text>Self-defense (self-defence primarily in Commonwealth English) is a countermeasure that involves defending the health and well-being of oneself from harm. The use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions.

==Physical==

Physical self-defense is the use of physical force to counter an immediate threat of violence. Such force can be either armed or unarmed. In either case, the chances of success depend on various parameters, related to the severity of the threat on one hand, but also on the mental and physical preparedness of the defender.

===Unarmed===

Many styles of martial arts are practiced for self-defense or include self-defense techniques. Some styles train primarily for self-defense, while other combat sports can be effectively applied for self-defense. Some martial arts train how to escape from a knife or gun situation or how to break away from a punch, while others train how to attack. To provide more practical self-defense, many modern martial arts schools now use a combination of martial arts styles and techniques and will often customize self-defense training to suit individual participants.

===Armed===

A wide variety of weapons can be deployed for use in a defensive capacity. The most suitable depends on the threat presented, the victim or victims, and the experience of the defender. Legal restrictions also vary greatly, and influence which self-defense options are available to choose from.

In some jurisdictions, firearms may be carried openly or concealed expressly for this purpose, while other jurisdictions have tight restrictions on who can own firearms, and what types they can own. Knives, especially those categorized as switchblades, may also be controlled, as may batons, pepper spray and personal electroshock weapons—although some may be legal to carry with a license or for certain professions.

Non-injurious water-based self-defense indelible dye-marker sprays, or ID-marker or DNA-marker sprays linking a suspect to a crime scene, would in most places be legal to own and carry.

Everyday objects, such as flashlights, baseball bats, newspapers, keyrings with keys, kitchen utensils and other tools, and hair spray aerosol cans in combination with a lighter, can also be used as improvised weapons for self-defense.

==== Verbal self-defense ====

Verbal self-defense is defined as using words &quot;to prevent, de-escalate, or end an attempted assault.&quot;

==Women&#x27;s self-defense==

According to Victims of Sexual Violence: Statistics on Rainn, about &quot;80 percent of juvenile victims were female and 90 percent of rape victims were adult women&quot;. In addition, women from ages 18 to 34 are highly at risk to experience sexual assault. According to historian Wendy Rouse in &quot;Her Own Hero: The Origins of Women&#x27;s Self-Defense Movement&quot;, women&#x27;s self-defense training emerged in the early twentieth century in the United States and the United Kingdom paralleling the women&#x27;s rights and suffrage movement. These early feminists sought to raise awareness about the sexual harassment and violence that women faced on the street, at work, and in the home. They challenged the notion that men were their &quot;natural protectors&quot; noting that men were often the perpetrators of violence against women. Women discovered a sense of physical and personal empowerment through training in boxing and jiu-jitsu. Interest in women&#x27;s self-defense paralleled subsequent waves of the women&#x27;s rights movement especially with the rise of Second-wave feminism in the 1960s and 1970s and Third-wave feminism in the 1990s. Today&#x27;s Empowerment Self-Defense (ESD) courses focus on teaching verbal and psychological as well as physical self-defense strategies. ESD courses explore the multiple sources of gender-based violence especially including its connections with sexism, racism, and classism. Empowerment Self-Defense instructors focus on holding perpetrators responsible while empowering women with the idea that they have both the right and ability to protect themselves.

==Self-defense education==
Self-defense techniques and recommended behavior under the threat of violence are systematically taught in self-defense classes. Commercial self-defense education is part of the martial arts industry in the wider sense, and many martial arts instructors also give self-defense classes. While all martial arts training can be argued to have some self-defense applications, self-defense courses are marketed explicitly as being oriented towards effectiveness and optimized towards situations as they occur in the real world. Many systems are taught commercially, tailored to the needs of specific target audiences (e.g. defense against attempted rape for women, self-defense for children and teens). Notable systems taught commercially include:

* Civilian versions of modern military combatives, such as Krav Maga, Defendo, Spear, Systema
* Japanese Armed &amp; Unarmed Combat Art Systems directly taught as Combatives with No Sport Aspect, also adapted to modern weapons such as Bujinkan
* Jujutsu and arts derived from it, such as Aikijujutsu, Aikido, Bartitsu, German ju-jutsu, and Kodokan Goshin Jutsu 
* Traditional unarmed fighting styles like Karate, Kung fu, Hapkido, Pencak Silat, Taekkyon, etc. These styles can also include competing.
* Traditional armed fighting styles like Kali/Eskrima/Arnis. These include competing, as well as armed and unarmed combats.
* Street Fighting oriented, unarmed systems, such as Jeet Kune Do, Kajukenbo, Won Sung Do,® and Keysi Fighting Method
* Martial sports, such as boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, savate, shoot boxing, Sanshou, Taekwondo, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and wrestling.

==Legal aspects==


===Application of the law===

In any given case, it can be difficult to evaluate whether force was excessive. Allowances for great force may be hard to reconcile with human rights.

The Intermediate People&#x27;s Court of Foshan, People&#x27;s Republic of China in a 2009 case ruled the killing of a robber during his escape attempt to be justifiable self-defense because &quot;the robbery was still in progress&quot; at this time.

In the United States between 2008 and 2012, approximately 1 out of every 38 gun-related deaths (which includes murders, suicides, and accidental deaths) was a justifiable killing, according to the Violence Policy Center.

In Canada, self-defense, in the context of criminal law, is a statutory defense that provides a full defense to the commission of a criminal act. It operates as a justification, the successful application of which means that owing to the circumstances in which the act was produced, it is not morally blameworthy. There are three elements an accused must demonstrate to successfully raise self-defense.

First, the accused must demonstrate that she or he believed on reasonable grounds that force was going to be used against her or him or another person or that a threat of force is being made against her or him or another person. The reasonableness of the belief is assessed through both a subjective and objective lens. Certain beliefs, including racist beliefs and beliefs induced by self-intoxication are prima facie unreasonable. Other beliefs related to the subjective experience of the accused may, however, be reasonable. These include any relevant military training (R v Khill), heightened awareness of patterns of cyclical violence in intimate relationships ( R v Lavallée) and whether the accused has autism (R v Kagan). 

Second, the act that constitutes the offence is committed for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person from that use or threat of force.

Third, the act that constitutes the offence must have been reasonable in the circumstances. There are a number of indicia which factor into whether the act was reasonable in the circumstances. For one, was the violence or threat of violence imminent? Usually, if there is a significant time interval between the original unlawful assault and the accused&#x27;s response, it undermines the contention that there were no other means available to respond to the potential use of force and one tends to suspect that the accused was motivated by revenge rather than self-defense. However, R v Lavalleé accepted expert evidence demonstrating that people experiencing battered women&#x27;s syndrome have special knowledge about the cyclical nature of violence in a way allows them to foresee when harm is coming. Second, it&#x27;s relevant whether there was a reasonable avenue of escape available to the accused. Under the old self-defense provision, there was a requirement for the accused to have believed on reasonable grounds that there was no alternative course of action open to him at the time, so that he reasonably thought that he was obliged to kill in order to preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm. Now, even though 34(2)(b) is only one consideration in a non-exhaustive list, the mandatory role it used to play in the common law suggests it carries considerable weight in determining the reasonableness of the act in the circumstances under 34(1)(c) 
As such, while there is no absolute duty to retreat, it is a prerequisite to the defense that there were no other legal means of responding available. In other words, there may be an obligation to do retreat where there is an option to do so (R v Cain). However, there is an exception to the obligation to retreat which is there is no requirement to flee from your own home to escape an assault to raise self-defense (R v Forde). Moreover, evidence of the accused suffering from battered women&#x27;s syndrome may evince that the accused reasonably perceived there to have been no means of escape (R v Lavalleé). Third, the accused&#x27;s role in the incident may play into the reasonableness of her or his act. Consideration of the accused&#x27;s role is not limited to whether he did any provocative or unlawful acts as it was under the old self-defense provisions (R v Khill). Fourth, the nature and proportionality of the accused&#x27;s response will factor into whether it was reasonable. While a person is not expected to weigh to a nicety the measure of force used to respond to violence or a threat thereof, grossly disproportionate force will tend to be unreasonable (R v Kong).

<text>Dukat is a fictional character from the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. A member of the fictional Cardassian species, he is introduced as the former overseer of the series&#x27; namesake space station but goes on to become the leader of his species&#x27; governing body, the Cardassian Union. At times an enemy, while at others an ally of Benjamin Sisko, Dukat appears in 35 of the series&#x27; 176 episodes. He was portrayed by Marc Alaimo throughout. Dukat became a fan favorite among &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans and he is widely considered to be one of the most iconic villains in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

==Creation and role==
The Cardassians were introduced to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Wounded&quot;. In that episode, Marc Alaimo played a Cardassian named Macet. While the similarities between Macet and Dukat were never explained when Dukat was cast for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; relaunch novel &quot;Demons of Air and Darkness&quot; features Macet, who explains to Kira Nerys, &quot;Skrain Dukat was my cousin.&quot;

Dukat played a versatile role throughout the series and was often a nuanced character. In the words of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; co-executive producer Ronald D. Moore: &quot;I don&#x27;t think of him as being completely evil through and through ... He can be charming. He can be generous. He can do the right thing. All of that somehow makes his &#x27;evil&#x27; actions all the more despicable, because we know that there was the potential in there for him to be a better person.&quot; Ultimately, despite the character&#x27;s versatility, &quot;Dukat is a bad guy. A very bad guy.&quot; Indeed, StarTrek.com describes him as &quot;the most complex and fully developed villain in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history&quot;.

==Appearances==
Prior to the start of the series, Dukat held the military title of Legate (Admiral) and was the head of the Cardassian occupation government of the planet Bajor as well as commander of the Cardassian-built station originally named &quot;Terok Nor&quot; (which would become known as &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; under the Federation). When the Cardassians are forced to withdraw, he is demoted to Gul (equivalent to Captain). Due to this background, Dukat&#x27;s early appearances range from being anti-heroic to antagonistic. In his debut appearance in the pilot episode &quot;Emissary&quot;, he takes a Cardassian warship to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; to demand from the new Starfleet-appointed commander Benjamin Sisko one of the recently discovered Orbs of the Bajoran Prophets.

In &quot;Cardassians&quot;, Dukat is at the center of a conspiracy which his exiled Cardassian enemy Elim Garak and Dr. Julian Bashir are trying to unravel. In &quot;Civil Defense&quot; he tries to blackmail the crew of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; when they cannot disarm an accidentally-triggered Cardassian counter-insurgency program. He is allied with the main Starfleet characters against the Maquis rebels in &quot;The Maquis&quot; and &quot;Defiant&quot;, and against the Klingons when they invade Cardassia in &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;.

In the season four episode &quot;Indiscretion&quot;, Kira Nerys accompanies Gul Dukat on a search for a lost Cardassian starship, where it is revealed he is trying to track down and kill his illegitimate half-Bajoran daughter Tora Ziyal. He ultimately resolves to take her home with him. The follow-up episode &quot;Return to Grace&quot; shows Dukat being disgraced with the Cardassian military as a result of this move, reduced to commanding a freighter with Ziyal and his deputy Damar. With Kira&#x27;s help, Dukat commandeers a Klingon Bird Of Prey and sends his government their battle plans. When he hears that the Cardassian government still wants to negotiate with the Klingons, he decides to use his new ship to launch a one-man war against the Klingon Empire, leaving Ziyal with Kira at &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. In this capacity he helps Sisko, Miles O&#x27;Brien, Odo and Worf infiltrate the Klingon Empire in the season five premiere &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;.

Dukat&#x27;s character returned to being a more antagonistic role in season five&#x27;s &quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;, where he is revealed to have negotiated Cardassia&#x27;s joining the Dominion, becoming head of the Union&#x27;s government in the process. He leads an invasion force which recaptures &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; in the season finale &quot;Call to Arms&quot;, effectively starting the Dominion War and retaking his old command.

Dukat loses the station again in the sixth season episode &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;, where Damar kills Ziyal in retaliation for having helped the Federation. Mentally broken, Dukat is easily captured by Starfleet. He escapes their custody when he and Sisko are marooned in &quot;Waltz&quot;, during which Dukat experiences hallucinations of Kira, Damar and Weyoun, comes to accept his hatred for the Bajorans, and swears vengeance on all Bajor before escaping. Toward this end, Dukat allies himself with—and is for a short time possessed by—the Pah-wraiths, arch-enemies of the Bajoran Prophets, and renders the latter&#x27;s Orbs useless, killing series character Jadzia Dax in &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;.

Dukat returns in season seven at the head of the cult of the Pah-wraiths in &quot;Covenant&quot;, but he is quickly disgraced in front of his followers by Kira and goes into hiding again. In &quot;Penumbra&quot;, he seeks Damar&#x27;s help to find a surgeon to make him look like a Bajoran. In this guise, he convinces Kai Winn to join him in his efforts to free the Pah-wraiths from their imprisonment in the Bajoran Fire Caves in &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;, even when she discovers his true identity in &quot;The Changing Face of Evil.&quot; Their plan is put into action in the series finale &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, where the Pah-wraiths choose him as their emissary instead of Winn. Sisko, emissary of the Prophets, arrives to stop him and at Winn&#x27;s advice shoves himself, the Pah-wraiths&#x27; holy book, and Dukat into the burning fire caves, sealing Dukat in the Fire Caves with the Pah-wraiths forever.

==Reception==
In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Dukat as the 15th best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall, calling the character a complicated and nuanced &quot;bad guy&quot;. They note the character&#x27;s morality in &quot;Indiscretion&quot; as well as his introduction in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; premiere, &quot;Emissary&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated Dukat as the eighth best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall as presented in television and film. &quot;Time&quot; rated Gul Dukat the fourth best villain of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in 2016.

In 2018, when &quot;CBR&quot; placed ten &quot;ST: Deep Space Nine&quot; characters in their list of the top 20 recurring characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise (plus two &quot;ST: The Next Generation&quot; characters who later came into their own in &quot;ST: Deep Space Nine&quot;, taking up 60% of the entire list), Gul Dukat was ranked third overall.

<text>Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American crime comedy-drama film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, Amy Adams, and James Brolin in supporting roles. The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson is based on the semi-autobiographical book of the same name by Frank Abagnale Jr., who claims that prior to his 19th birthday, he successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. However, the truth of his story is, as of the 2020s, heavily disputed.

A movie version of Abagnale&#x27;s book of the same name was contemplated soon after it was published in 1980 but began in earnest in 1997 when Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks bought the film rights. David Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Lasse Hallström, Miloš Forman, and Cameron Crowe were all considered to direct the film before Spielberg decided to direct it himself. Filming took place from February to May 2002.

The film opened on December 25, 2002, to major critical and commercial success, grossing $352 million worldwide. At the 75th Academy Awards, Christopher Walken and John Williams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Score, respectively.

==Plot==

In 1969, FBI agent Carl Hanratty arrives in Marseille, France, to pick up a prisoner named Frank Abagnale Jr., who has fallen ill due to the prison&#x27;s poor conditions.

Six years ago, Frank lived in New Rochelle, New York, with his father, Frank Sr., and his French mother, Paula. During his youth, he witnesses his father&#x27;s many techniques for conning people, but Frank Sr.&#x27;s tax problems with the IRS eventually force the family to move from their house and into a small apartment.

One day, Frank discovers his mother is having an affair with Jack Barnes, his father&#x27;s friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club. When his parents divorce, Frank runs away. Needing money, he turns to confidence scams to survive, his cons progressively growing bolder. He poses as a Pan Am pilot named Frank Taylor and forges the airline&#x27;s payroll checks. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars.

News of the crimes reaches the FBI and Carl begins tracking Frank. He finds him at a motel, but Frank tricks Carl into believing he is a Secret Service agent named Barry Allen. He escapes before Carl realizes he was fooled.

Frank then begins to impersonate a doctor. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital nurse, and asks her attorney father for both her hand in marriage and help with arrangements to take the Louisiana State Bar exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda&#x27;s engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window, telling Brenda to meet him at Miami International Airport two days later.

At the airport, Frank spots Brenda, but also plainclothed agents. He realizes she has given him up, then drives away. Reassuming his pilot identity, he stages a recruiting drive for stewardesses at a local college. Surrounded by eight women as stewardesses, he conceals himself from Carl and the other agents at the airport and escapes on a flight to Madrid.

In 1967, Carl tracks down Frank in his mother&#x27;s hometown of Montrichard, France, and convinces him to surrender to the French police. Frank is immediately arrested and taken into French custody, but Carl assures him that he will get him extradited back to the U.S.

Picking back up once more in 1969, Carl takes Frank on a flight back to the U.S. As they approach, Carl informs Frank that Frank Sr. has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane and reaches the house of his mother, who now has a daughter with Barnes. Frank surrenders to Carl and is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum-security prison.

Carl occasionally visits Frank. During one visit, he shows him a fraudulent check from a case he is working on. Frank immediately deduces that the bank teller was involved in the fraud. Impressed, Carl convinces the FBI to allow him to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI Financial Crimes Unit. Frank agrees but soon grows restless doing the tedious office work.

One weekend, Frank prepares to impersonate a pilot again and is intercepted by Carl, who is willing to let him continue with his con, assuring him that no one is chasing him and that it&#x27;s his choice. Frank returns to work and discusses another fraud case with Carl, who asks him how he cheated on the Louisiana State Bar exam. Frank tells him he studied and passed it. Carl smiles and asks Frank if he&#x27;s telling the truth, but Frank doesn&#x27;t answer, instead giving Carl input on a new fraud case.

A postscript says that Frank lived for 26 years in the Midwestern United States with his wife, with whom he had three sons, remained friends with Carl, and made a living as a leading expert on bank fraud and forgery in the FBI.

==Cast==
The real Frank Abagnale appears in a cameo as a French police officer arresting his onscreen counterpart.

==Production==
===Development===
Frank Abagnale sold the film rights to his autobiography in 1980. According to Abagnale, producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin purchased the film rights after seeing him on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Two years later, they sold the rights to Columbia Pictures, who in turn sold the rights to producer Hall Bartlett. Bartlett and business partner Michael J. Lasky hired Steven Kunes to write the screenplay, but Bartlett died before the project found a distributor. The rights were then sold to Hollywood Pictures, a division of Disney, and when the project went into turnaround, the rights were again sold to Bungalow 78 Productions, a division of TriStar Pictures. From there, the project was presented to Steven Spielberg at DreamWorks Pictures.

According to &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, executive producer Michel Shane purchased the film rights in 1990 for Paramount Pictures. By December 1997, Barry Kemp purchased the film rights from Shane, bringing the project to DreamWorks, with Jeff Nathanson writing the script. By April 2000, David Fincher was attached to direct over the course of a few months, but dropped out in favor of &quot;Panic Room&quot;. In July 2000, Leonardo DiCaprio had entered discussions to star, with Gore Verbinski to direct. Spielberg signed on as producer, and filming was set to begin in March 2001.

===Casting===
Verbinski cast James Gandolfini as Carl Hanratty, Ed Harris as Frank Abagnale Sr. and Chloë Sevigny as Brenda Strong. Verbinski dropped out because of DiCaprio&#x27;s commitment to &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;. Lasse Hallström was in negotiations to direct by May 2001, but dropped out in July 2001. At this stage, Harris and Sevigny left the film, but DiCaprio and Gandolfini were still attached. Spielberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, offered the job of director to Miloš Forman, and considered hiring Cameron Crowe. During this negotiation period, Spielberg began to consider directing the film himself, eventually dropping projects such as &quot;Big Fish&quot; and &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. Spielberg officially committed to directing in August 2001. That same month, Tom Hanks was cast to replace Gandolfini, who had exited due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

The search for Sevigny&#x27;s replacement as Brenda Strong lasted months, but Amy Adams was eventually cast. Spielberg &quot;loved&quot; her tape, and producer Walter F. Parkes commented that she was &quot;as fresh and honest as anyone we&#x27;d seen&quot;, which was an important element in the role. Christopher Walken was cast as Frank Abagnale Sr. following Parkes&#x27;s suggestion. Martin Sheen played Roger Strong, as he had &quot;intimidating presence&quot;. Spielberg wanted a French actress to portray Paula Abagnale to stay true to the facts. He asked for the help of Brian De Palma, who was living in Paris, and he did tests with several actresses such as Nathalie Baye. Spielberg had seen Jennifer Garner on &quot;Alias&quot; and offered her a small role in the film.

===Filming===
Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2002, but was pushed to February 7 in Los Angeles, California. Locations included Burbank, Downey, New York City, LA/Ontario International Airport (which doubled for Miami International Airport), Quebec City and Montreal. The film was shot in 147 locations in only 52 days. DiCaprio reflected, &quot;Scenes that we thought would take three days took an afternoon.&quot; Filming ran from April 25–30 on Park Avenue, just outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Production moved to Orange, New Jersey and returned to Brooklyn for bank and courthouse scenes. Shooting also took place at the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Quebec City was chosen for its atmosphere. Place Royale, within Old Quebec, stands in for Montrichard, and the church in the background of the arrest scene is Notre-Dame-des-Victoires.

Filming ended on May 12 in Montreal.

===Music===

The original score was composed and conducted by John Williams. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on December 10, 2002, by DreamWorks Records. All music composed and conducted by John Williams unless otherwise stated.
==Historical accuracy==
Abagnale had little involvement with the film, but believed Spielberg was the only filmmaker who &quot;could do this film justice&quot;, despite various changes from purportedly real events. In November 2001, Abagnale said:
I am not a consultant on the film. I&#x27;ve never met or spoken to Steven Spielberg and I have not read the script. I prefer not to. I understand that they now portray my father in a better light, as he really was. Steven Spielberg has told the screenplay writer (Jeff Nathanson) that he wants complete accuracy in the relationships and actual scams that I perpetrated. I hope in the end the movie will be entertaining, exciting, funny and bring home an important message about family, childhood and divorce.

Abagnale says he never saw his father again after he ran away from home, but Spielberg &quot;wanted to continue to have that connection where Frank kept trying to please his father; by making him proud of him; by seeing him in the uniform, the Pan-American uniform.&quot;

In a 2017 presentation for &quot;Talks at Google&quot;, Abagnale commented on the accuracy of the film:
I&#x27;ve only seen the movie twice. So when the media asked me what I thought about the movie, and what was right and what was wrong, I said: &quot;First of all I have two brothers and a sister; he portrayed me as an only child. In real life, my mother never remarried; there&#x27;s a scene in the movie where she&#x27;s remarried, and has a little girl. That didn&#x27;t really happen. In real life I never saw my father after I ran away; in the movie they keep having him come back to Christopher Walken in the film. That didn&#x27;t really happen. ... I escaped off the aircraft through the kitchen galley where they bring the food and stuff onto the plane; and there they had me escape through the toilet.&quot; I thought he stayed very close to the story, but pretty much all of that. He was very concerned about being accurate, first of all because it was the first time he made a movie about a real person living. Second the Bureau had an information officer on the set for all the shooting of the entire film to make sure that what he said about the FBI ... was accurate. ... And then of course, as he later said, &quot;I really got most of my information from those three retired agents&quot; ... So I thought he did a good job of staying very, very accurate at the movie.

In addition, the FBI agent who Abagnale alleges tracked and later worked with him was Joseph Shea; Abagnale has said that because Shea did not want his name used in the film, the character was renamed Carl and given the surname Hanratty, based on the football player Terry Hanratty.

Despite his claim that Spielberg &quot;stayed very close to the story&quot;, records show Abagnale was in the Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Fort Ann, New York, between the ages of 17 and 20 (July 26, 1965, to December 24, 1968, inmate #25367), and before that, he was in the United States Navy (December 1964 to February 1965). Six weeks after his release from Great Meadow, on February 14, 1969, he was rearrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was jailed locally, and in June 1969, he was convicted of stealing from a local family and small business in Baton Rouge. Abagnale did dress as a Pan American Airlines pilot for a brief period in the fall of 1970. He was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia, on November 2, 1970. Federal court records associated with his conviction show he cashed only 10 personal checks with a Pan American Airlines logo, totaling less than $1,500. The facts behind many of Abagnale&#x27;s exaggerated claims, and their inclusion or omission from the film, were the subject of renewed media reporting in 2021. In 1978, several journalists debunked his claim that he passed the Louisiana bar and worked for Attorney General Jack P. F. Gremillion. Journalist Ira Perry was unable to find any evidence that Abagnale worked with the FBI; according to one retired FBI Special Agent in Charge, Abagnale was caught trying to pass fraudulent checks in 1978, several years after he claimed that he began working with the FBI.

==Themes==
&quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot; deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods. Spielberg&#x27;s parents divorced when he was a teenager, similar to Frank Abagnale&#x27;s situation. In the film, Carl Hanratty is also divorced from his wife, who lives with their daughter in Chicago. &quot;Some of my films have had to do with broken homes and people on the run from their sad pasts,&quot; Spielberg stated: But there are those strands that got me to say: you know, there&#x27;s something also about me that I can say through the telling of this kind of lighthearted story.Spielberg also wanted to create a film that sympathized with a crook. He explained: Frank was a 21st-century genius working within the innocence of the mid &#x27;60s, when people were more trusting than they are now. I don&#x27;t think this is the kind of movie where somebody could say, &#x27;I have a career plan.&#x27;

==Release==
DreamWorks was careful to market the film as &quot;inspired by a true story&quot; to avoid controversy similar to that surrounding &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1999), both of which deviated from history. The premiere took place at Westwood, Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2002.

Game Show Network has aired the 1977 episode of the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; that featured Frank Abagnale. Segments were shown on December 29, 2002, and January 1, 2003, as promotion.

===Home media===
&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on May 6, 2003 by DreamWorks Home Entertainment. The DVD was released as a 2-Disc Special Edition and included special features including never-before-seen footage by director Steven Spielberg as well as interviews. As of December 2003, the video sold 3,20 million copies earning a profit of over 56.3 million dollars. For the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary, a Blu-ray version was released on December 4, 2012, and a 20th anniversary Blu-Ray version followed on October 4, 2022.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; was released on December 25, 2002, earning slightly above $30 million in 3,225 theaters during its opening weekend, in second place behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;. The film went on to gross $164.6 million in North America and $187.5 million in foreign countries, with a worldwide total of $352.1 million. The film was a financial success, recouping the $52 million budget seven times over. &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; was the eleventh highest-grossing film of 2002; &quot;Minority Report&quot;, also a Spielberg film, was the tenth highest.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; has a rating of 96% based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With help from a strong performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life wunderkind con artist Frank Abagnale, Steven Spielberg crafts a film that&#x27;s stylish, breezily entertaining, and surprisingly sweet.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert heavily praised DiCaprio&#x27;s performance, and concluded &quot;This is not a major Spielberg film, although it is an effortlessly watchable one.&quot; Mick LaSalle said it was &quot;not Spielberg&#x27;s best movie, but one of his smoothest and maybe his friendliest. The colorful cinematography, smart performances and brisk tempo suggest a filmmaker subordinating every other impulse to the task of manufacturing pleasure.&quot; Stephen Hunter believed DiCaprio shows &quot;the range and ease and cleverness that Martin Scorsese so underutilized in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;.

James Berardinelli observed, &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot; never takes itself or its subjects too seriously, and contains more genuinely funny material than about 90% of the so-called &#x27;comedies&#x27; found in multiplexes these days.&quot; Berardinelli praised John Williams&#x27;s film score, which he felt was &quot;more intimate and jazzy than his usual material, evoking (intentionally) Henry Mancini&quot;. Peter Travers was one of few who gave the film a negative review; he considered the film to be &quot;bogged down over 140 minutes. A film that took off like a hare on speed ends like a winded tortoise.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Musical adaptation==

A musical adaptation of the same name premiered at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, Washington in July 2009, starring Aaron Tveit and Norbert Leo Butz. It began previews on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on March 11, 2011, and officially opened April 10, 2011. The musical was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

<text>Bleach is the debut studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on June 15, 1989, by Sub Pop. After the release of their debut single &quot;Love Buzz&quot; on Sub Pop in November 1988, Nirvana rehearsed for two to three weeks in preparation for recording a full-length album. The main recording sessions for &quot;Bleach&quot; took place at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington between December 1988 and January 1989. It is the only Nirvana album released on the Sub Pop label and their only studio album to feature drummer Chad Channing.

&quot;Bleach&quot; did not chart upon initial release, but was well received by critics. When reissued internationally by Geffen Records in 1992 following the breakthrough success of Nirvana&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), &quot;Bleach&quot; peaked at number 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 33 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 34 on the Australian albums chart. In 2009, Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Bleach&quot; featuring a live recording of a 1990 Nirvana performance in Portland, Oregon as bonus material.

&quot;Bleach&quot; had sold 40,000 copies in North America before the release of &quot;Nevermind&quot;. It has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than 1.9 million copies in the United States alone. It is Sub Pop&#x27;s best-selling album to date and is unlikely to be surpassed by competitors. Frontman Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994 also led to a resurgence in the album&#x27;s popularity, reaching number one on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. In April 2019, &quot;Bleach&quot; was ranked No. 13 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot;.

==Recording==
After the release of its debut single &quot;Love Buzz&quot; on Sub Pop in November 1988, Nirvana practiced for two to three weeks in preparation for recording a full-length album, even though Sub Pop had only requested an EP. The main sessions for &quot;Bleach&quot; took place at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle, with local producer Jack Endino.

Nirvana began recording with a five-hour session on December 24, 1988. The band recorded again on December 29–31, and on January 14 and 24. Three of the album&#x27;s songs – &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot;, &quot;Paper Cuts&quot;, and &quot;Downer&quot; – were recorded during a previous session at Reciprocal Studios in January 1988, featuring Melvins drummer Dale Crover. Despite attempts to re-record them with new drummer Chad Channing, the band ultimately decided to remix the versions recorded with Crover for the final version of &quot;Bleach&quot;. &quot;Big Long Now&quot; was omitted from the album because frontman Kurt Cobain felt &quot;there was already enough slow heavy stuff on &quot;Bleach&quot;, and he &#x27;didn&#x27;t want that song to go out, according to Endino. The album was edited and sequenced. Still, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt ordered that the album be completely re-sequenced. The record was further delayed for several months until Sub Pop was able to secure sufficient funds to issue it.

Endino billed the band thirty hours of recording at $606.17 ($1,541.34 in 2024). Jason Everman, a guitarist who was impressed by Nirvana&#x27;s demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money. He briefly joined the group as second guitarist. Everman was credited as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other guitarist on the album cover, even though he did not perform on the album. Bassist Krist Novoselic explained, &quot;We just wanted to make him feel at home in the band.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
According to Cobain, the music on &quot;Bleach&quot; conformed with the grunge genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed. &quot;There was this pressure from Sub Pop and the grunge scene to play &#x27;rock music&#x27;&quot;, Cobain said, and noted that he &quot;[stripped] it down and [made] it sound like Aerosmith.&quot; Cobain also felt he had to fit the expectations of the grunge sound to build a fanbase, and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record. Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the band had played a tape in their tour van that had an album by the Smithereens on one side and one by the band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The songs were described as &quot;deliberately bleak, claustrophobic, and lyrically sparse, with none of the manic derangement or sense of release of the live performance&quot;. Cobain said that the song structures were &quot;one–dimensional&quot;, and said that he sought to present a more &quot;polished and urbane side of himself&quot;.

&quot;Bleach&quot; was heavily influenced by the Seattle-based sludge metal scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, pioneered by Melvins. Author Gillian G. Gaar wrote that &quot;Bleach&quot; &quot;[has] its share – some would say more than its share – of dirty sludge&quot;, and Sub Pop describes the single &quot;Love Buzz/Big Cheese&quot; to be &quot;heavy pop sludge.&quot;

Describing the various songs on &quot;Bleach&quot;, Christopher Sandford wrote: &quot;&#x27;Paper Cuts&#x27; includes a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm of an early Led Zeppelin number; &#x27;Mr. Moustache&#x27; addressed itself to Nirvana&#x27;s male fans; &#x27;Downer&#x27; showed the same exceptional contempt for the group&#x27;s audience&quot;. Sandford felt &quot;School&quot; – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that &quot;served as the rip&quot;. While &quot;Scoff&quot; is &quot;a parting salvo at [Cobain&#x27;s parents]&quot;, &quot;Negative Creep&quot; was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, &quot;About a Girl&quot; has a &quot;chiming melody and ironic chorus&quot;. In &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, Keith Cameron said the song &quot;was exhilarating and it was exciting because that was the nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last&quot;. In his book &quot;Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song&quot;, Chuck Crisafulli writes that the song &quot;stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject&quot;.

In one of his first interviews, Cobain told &quot;Sounds&quot; journalist John Robb, &quot;When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself, just to try to make myself a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the &quot;Bleach&quot; album are about my life in Aberdeen.&quot;

In 1993, Cobain told &quot;Spin&quot; that on &quot;Bleach&quot; he &quot;didn&#x27;t give a flying fuck what the lyrics were about&quot; and claimed that 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before recording. He was often still working on the words on the drive to the recording studio. He explained: &quot;It was like I&#x27;m pissed off. Don&#x27;t know what about. Let&#x27;s just scream negative lyrics, and as long as they&#x27;re not sexist and don&#x27;t get too embarrassing it&#x27;ll be okay. I don&#x27;t hold any of those lyrics dear to me.&quot; Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that, nevertheless, many of the songs on the album reflected Cobain and various incidents in his life. &quot;Mr. Moustache&quot; was inspired by Cobain&#x27;s dislike of macho behavior, while &quot;School&quot; was a critique of the Seattle music scene, particularly Sub Pop.

==Release and promotion==

The album cover was photographed by Cobain&#x27;s then-girlfriend Tracy Marander during a concert at the Reko Muse art gallery in Olympia, Washington. On February 25, 1989, Nirvana played at venues on the west coast, including the University of Washington. The group began its first European tour, a double headliner with the band Tad, at the Riverside venue in Newcastle upon Tyne on October 23, 1989. On December 3, they played a &quot;triumphant&quot; set at the London Astoria. Christopher Sandford related: &quot;when the style pundits noted Cobain&#x27;s &#x27;patent lumberjack shirts and ugly fifties geometric-patterned jerseys&#x27;, seeing an example of &#x27;low-couture chic&#x27; they missed the point that flannel shirts and sweaters were everyday dress in the marine climate of the Northwest&quot;. Cobain took note and said that he never intended to start a fad or act as a role model.

The album&#x27;s working title was &quot;Too Many Humans&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Bleach&quot; after Cobain found an AIDS prevention poster while Nirvana was driving through San Francisco. The poster advised heroin addicts to bleach their needles before use, featuring the slogan &quot;Bleach Your Works&quot;. In Australia, &quot;Bleach&quot; was released on Waterfront Records and re-issued on various colored covers and colored vinyl prior to 1992. The song &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot; received airplay on Seattle radio station KCMU.

Due to increasing dissatisfaction with Everman over the course of the Bleach tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote &quot;Bleach&quot; as much as other releases, it was a steady seller for a Sub Pop release. However, Cobain was upset by the label&#x27;s lack of promotion and distribution for the album.

In April 1992, following the success of Nirvana&#x27;s second album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Sub Pop released a remastered version of &quot;Bleach&quot; on LP, CD and cassette. Geffen Records handled the international release. The CD version was packaged in a cardboard foldout case that included a bonus booklet filled with photos of the band from 1987 to 1990. For the 20th anniversary of the album, Sub Pop released on November 3, 2009 a deluxe reissue of &quot;Bleach&quot; featuring a March 2009 remastering from the original tapes by George Marino and a live recording of a 1990 show at Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Pine Street Theatre. Everman is no longer given credit on the album, but can still be seen on the front cover and is given a special thanks in the booklet.

==Reception==
&quot;Bleach&quot; did not sell well but received positive reviews from critics when it was first released. It &quot;became a moderate hit on college radio and the underground/DIY circuit&quot;, according to Charles M. Young in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;. In &quot;NME&quot;, Edwin Pouncey gave &quot;Bleach&quot; an eight-out-of-ten rating and wrote, &quot;This is the biggest, baddest sound that Sub Pop have so far managed to unearth. So primitive that they manage to make label mates Mudhoney sound like Genesis, Nirvana turn up the volume and spit and claw their way to the top of the musical garbage heap.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer Push deemed Nirvana &quot;the only Sub Pop act to date whose songs consistently equal the standard set by their mates Mudhoney&quot;. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth was impressed by the album, finding it &quot;primal&quot; and the songwriting &quot;completely melodious&quot; but also &quot;punk&quot;, and during the mastering of Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Goo&quot; (1990), Moore expressed his desire for a sound similar to that of &quot;Bleach&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that &quot;Kurt Cobain illustrated signs of his considerable songcraft&quot; on &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;particularly on the minor-key ballad &#x27;About a Girl&#x27; and the dense churn of &#x27;Blew&#x27;&quot;, summarizing the album as &quot;a debut from a band that shows potential but haven&#x27;t yet achieved it.&quot; Author Dave Thompson stated in 2000 that &quot;history [wouldn&#x27;t] hear a word against [the album]&quot;, but added that if &quot;one just came down from a few decades on Mars, 42 minutes of growly, lo-fi probably wouldn&#x27;t change your life too much&quot;. Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Familiar now with Cobain&#x27;s extraordinary gift, we can hear it loud and clear on the 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;. Cobain&#x27;s gigantic, goofy, bass-playing buddy Krist Novoselic added drollery to the band&#x27;s chaotic irreverence.&quot; Christgau later commented that while he found Endino&#x27;s production &quot;way too dry for grunge, a way of music that benefits from extra sputum&quot;, he nonetheless considered &quot;Bleach&quot; &quot;a major album&quot;. Anthony Carew from About.com said that &quot;Bleach&quot; defined &quot;the entire decade of the &#x27;90s&quot; and argued that while Nirvana&#x27;s later albums &quot;were more widely acclaimed, caused a bigger cultural impact, and were generally more accomplished&quot;, &quot;the band&#x27;s essence was at its most essential on their debut.&quot;

Before &quot;Nevermind&quot; was released, &quot;Bleach&quot; had sold 40,000 copies in North America. The 1992 re-release of the album was more successful on the charts, with &quot;Bleach&quot; eventually reaching number 89 at the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 33 on the UK album charts, number 34 on the Australian Recording Industry Association chart, and number 22 on the Finland charts. Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994 also led to a resurgence of popularity, with &quot;Bleach&quot; entering the Top Pop Catalog chart at number six in the week following his death, and eventually earning the top spot on May 7. The 2009 deluxe edition entered the Catalog Albums chart at number seven. &quot;Bleach&quot; was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 1995, and had sold an estimated 1.9 million copies in the United States by September 2016. It has also been certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. It is Sub Pop&#x27;s best-selling album release to date.

<doc id="215883" wikidata="Q531849" url="?curid=215883" title="Necessity (criminal law)">
<text>In the criminal law of many nations, necessity may be either a possible justification or an exculpation for breaking the law. Defendants seeking to rely on this defense argue that they should not be held liable for their actions as a crime because their conduct was &quot;necessary&quot; to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as self defense. As a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. 

For example, drunk drivers might contend that they drove their car to get away from being kidnapped (cf. &quot;North by Northwest&quot;). Most common law and civil law jurisdictions recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm they sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct they are charged with; (b) they had no reasonable alternative; (c) they ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) they themselves did not create the danger they sought to avoid. Thus, with the &quot;drunk driver&quot; example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to them.

For another example, the fire services and other civil defence organizations have a general duty to keep the community safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a fire break, or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. 

These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, parents who lack the financial means to feed their children cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. 

Further, some states apply a test of proportionality, where the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of cost–benefit analysis.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===Canada===
In Canada, necessity is recognized as a defence for crimes committed in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril in which the accused has no safe or legal way out of the situation. 

Three requirements for defence of necessity:
# Urgent situation of imminent peril or danger 
# No reasonable legal alternative
# Proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided

The first and second element are evaluated on the modified objective standard. The third element is evaluated on a purely objective standard: R v Latimer, 2001 SCC 1.

===Denmark and Norway===
Emergency law/right (&quot;nødret&quot;, &quot;nødrett&quot;) is the equivalent of necessity in Denmark and Norway. It is considered related to but separate from self-defence. Common legal examples of necessity includes: breaking windows and other objects in order to escape a fire, commandeering a vehicle to serve as an emergency ambulance, ignoring traffic rules while rushing a dying patient to a hospital, and even killing a person who poses an immediate threat to several other people not including yourself. In the last case self-defense laws are not enough, but the case is covered by &quot;nødret&quot;. &quot;Nødret&quot; can only be invoked though when no other option is available.
===English law ===

Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases there is no corresponding defense in English law for murder.

===Singapore===
Necessity is a defence per the Penal Code.
This requires lack of criminal intent, good faith (due care and attention), and the goal of preventing harm. The harm must be sufficiently serious and imminent to justify or excuse the act.

===Switzerland===

In two separate cases in 2020, climate activists were not convicted of trespassing and damaging property after holding unauthorized demonstrations in Crédit Suisse branches due to pleading a necessity defense in the face of a climate emergency.
===Taiwan ===
Necessity is a possible defense per the Criminal Code and the Administrative Penalty Act.

===United States===
Necessity as a defense to criminal acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected in the case of &quot;United States v. Schoon&quot;. In that case, 30 people, including appellants, gained admittance to the IRS office in Tucson, where they chanted &quot;keep America&#x27;s tax dollars out of El Salvador,&quot; splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and carpeting, and generally obstructed the office&#x27;s operation. The court ruled that the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.

====In specific states====

The Winooski 44 case in Vermont resulted in activists being acquitted of charges after using a necessity defense.

== In religious law ==
=== Judaism ===
In Judaism, the principle of &quot;pikuach nefesh&quot; allows any law to be broken to save a life, except laws against murder, adultery/incest and blasphemy/idolatry.
=== Catholicism ===

<doc id="215884" wikidata="Q127259" url="?curid=215884" title="Leaders of the New School">
<text>Leaders of the New School was an American hip hop group based in Long Island, New York.

==History==
===1986–1990: Early Years===
In 1984, Leaders of the New School was formed by Long Island natives Charlie Brown (born Bryan Higgins on September 19, 1970), Busta Rhymes (born Trevor Smith, Jr. on May 20, 1972) and Dinco D (born James Jackson on November 4, 1971). Rhymes&#x27; cousin Cut Monitor Milo (born Sheldon Scott on July 4, 1970) became the group&#x27;s DJ and would also rap in the group occasionally.
During a performance at Payday, a roving and short-lived hip-hop party in New York&#x27;s late-1980s club scene, the group was discovered by Elektra Records A&amp;R Dante Ross.
The group performed for fellow Long Island based hip hop group Public Enemy, who had already rose to prominence, at a talent show circa 1989. There, Busta Rhymes and Charlie Brown were given their respective stage names by Chuck D of Public Enemy. Shortly afterward, production team the Bomb Squad took them under their wings and taught them how to produce by spending a significant amount of time with the group.

The members of the leaders of the New School were offered the option of performing as one of two group names chosen by the Bomb Squad: Leaders of the New School or Young Black Teenagers. When they were informed by The Bomb Squad that they were mentoring another crew who were interested in taking the L.O.N.S. name, both groups were told that they would have to battle for it. Both sides had to make a song called &quot;Fuck The Old School,&quot; and who created the better song would win the L.O.N.S. designator. The loser would have to settle for Young Black Teenagers as their group name. After Rhymes and Brown&#x27;s group earned the name Leaders of the New School, the white group was named Young Black Teenagers.

There were often conflicts between group members Charlie Brown and Busta Rhymes due to power struggles between the two ever since the group was constructed and creative differences over artistic direction and musical aesthetics rooting in both considering themselves the leader of the rap group. This resulted in Rhymes separating from the group and planning to work on music by himself. Dante Ross, who was working for Elektra Records, contacted Brown and wanted to sign the group. However, Ross was adamant about signing the lineup he&#x27;d seen at Payday. Brown and Busta, who were still in high school at the time, patched things up to sign the deal.

In 1990, Leaders of the New School signed their record deal with Elektra Records and made their first appearance on Elektra&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Rubaiyat: Elektra&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot;, with a song called &quot;Mt. Airy Groove&quot;. They were the lone rap act to be included on the compilation. They soon joined hip hop collective Native Tongues, which also included De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest and Queen Latifah, amongst others. By 1990, the group started working on their debut album, &quot;A Future without a Past...&quot;, with Dante Ross&#x27; production team, John Gamble and Geebi Dajani, the Vibe Chemist Backspin and former mentor Eric &quot;Vietnam&quot; Sadler.

===1991-1993: &quot;A Future without a Past..., T.I.M.E. (The Inner Mind&#x27;s Eye)&quot; and break up===
On February 13, 1991, Leaders of the New school released the song &quot;Case of the P.T.A.&quot; as their debut single. &quot;Teachers, Don&#x27;t Teach Us Nonsense&quot; was included as the B-side. Both songs were instantly included on mixtapes and played on the radio for months. They made their first television appearance in the episode &quot;Anton in the Burbs&quot; of FOX&#x27;s then-new hit sketch comedy series, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, performing their two newly released songs. The episode aired on February 17, 1991. BET&#x27;s Rap City, MTV&#x27;s Yo! MTV Raps, as well as Ralph McDaniels&#x27; Video Music Box played the music video for &quot;Case Of The P.T.A.&quot; on regular rotation. The song peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard Hot Rap Singles&quot; chart.

On June 19, 1991, the group released their second single, &quot;Sobb Story&quot;. Posse cut &quot;Sound of the Zeekers&quot; featuring Cracker Jacks, Rumpletilskinz and Kollie Weed was included as the B-side. Both songs quickly caught airplay on the radio. After &quot;Sobb Story&quot; received an official music video, the song became even more popular and eventually peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard Hot Rap Singles&quot;.

On July 30, 1991, Leaders of the New School released their debut studio album &quot;A Future without a Past...&quot;. The album contained 17 total tracks, including the previously released singles and their B-sides. The songs revolve around common problems the youth may face in their day-to-day life. Each group member except Milo had at least one solo song on the album. Fourth member and the group&#x27;s DJ Cut Monitor Milo only appeared on two of fourteen actual songs.

In September 1991, they produced three tracks on American rapper Nikki D&#x27;s sole studio album &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girl&quot;. That same month, they appeared on A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s posse cut &quot;Scenario&quot; from their second studio album &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. Leaders member Busta Rhymes attracted attention with his verse in the song, which led to him launching a successful solo career. In October, they once again appeared in &quot;In Living Color&quot; in the episode &quot;Green Eggs and the Guvment Cheese&quot; again performing &quot;Teachers, Don&#x27;t Teach Us Nonsense&quot;. In the same month, they also appeared on the &quot;Strictly Business&quot; soundtrack, with the song &quot;Shining Star&quot;.

On March 13, 1992, A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;Scenario&quot; was issued as a single and received an official music video. Additionally, a remix was included as the B-side and featured a newcomer named Kid Hood, who was murdered three days after recording his verse, alongside A Tribe Called Quest and the Leaders of the New School. In the same month, &quot;The International Zone Coaster&quot; was released as the third and last single from &quot;A Future without a Past...&quot;. On April 11, 1992, the song hit number 1 on the &quot;Billboard Hot Rap Singles&quot;. A live performance of &quot;Scenario&quot; with Leaders of the New School on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; led to greater popularity.

In January 1993, Leaders of the New School produced and featured on James Brown&#x27;s single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Any Harder&quot;.

The group&#x27;s second and final album was &quot;T.I.M.E.&quot; (&quot;The Inner Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;), released in 1993, and spawning the singles &quot;What&#x27;s Next&quot;, &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; &amp; &quot;Classic Material&quot;.

As time passed, fans and critics began to focus less on LONS as a group and more on Busta Rhymes as a solo artist. During an infamous appearance on the TV show &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;, the group was seen arguing, with member Charlie Brown becoming upset over Rhymes&#x27; show-stealing. The group soon split up, with Charlie Brown, Dinco D and Milo garnering very limited success individually, while Busta Rhymes&#x27; popularity continued to increase.

The group made an appearance on Rhymes&#x27; 1996 debut album &quot;The Coming&quot;, on the track &quot;Keep It Movin&#x27;&quot; and was the last time they would collaborate as a group. In July 2012, the group reunited on stage during Busta Rhymes&#x27; headlining set at the Brooklyn Hip-Hop Festival, to perform &quot;Case of the P.T.A.&quot; and &quot;Scenario&quot; in its entirety with A Tribe Called Quest. The group later reunited again in 2015 on the song &quot;We Home&quot; from Busta Rhymes&#x27; mixtape &quot;The Return Of The Dragon: The Abstract Went On Vacation&quot;.

==Reunion==
The group reunited for two shows in 2012. Dinco D released his debut solo album &quot;Cameo Flows&quot; on November 4, 2016. The album features appearances by fellow members Charlie Brown and Cut Monitor Milo.

In December 2016, Dinco D and Charlie Brown announced on &quot;The Library With Tim Einenkel&quot; podcast that the group was working on new material together but did not give any indication to when it would be released. The following month, Busta Rhymes made similar comments on N.O.R.E. &amp; DJ EFN&#x27;s &quot;Drink Champs&quot; podcast.

<text>In linear algebra, the permanent of a square matrix is a function of the matrix similar to the determinant. The permanent, as well as the determinant, is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix. Both are special cases of a more general function of a matrix called the immanant.

== Definition ==
The permanent of an matrix is defined as

formula_1

The sum here extends over all elements σ of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;; i.e. over all permutations of the numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;.

For example,

formula_2

and

formula_3

The definition of the permanent of &quot;A&quot; differs from that of the determinant of &quot;A&quot; in that the signatures of the permutations are not taken into account.

The permanent of a matrix A is denoted per &quot;A&quot;, perm &quot;A&quot;, or Per &quot;A&quot;, sometimes with parentheses around the argument. Minc uses Per(&quot;A&quot;) for the permanent of rectangular matrices, and per(&quot;A&quot;) when &quot;A&quot; is a square matrix. Muir and Metzler use the notation formula_4

The permanent is believed to be more difficult to compute than the determinant. While the determinant can be computed in polynomial time by Gaussian elimination, Gaussian elimination cannot be used to compute the permanent. Moreover, computing the permanent of a (0,1)-matrix is #P-complete. Thus, if the permanent can be computed in polynomial time by any method, then FP = #P, which is an even stronger statement than P = NP. When the entries of &quot;A&quot; are nonnegative, however, the permanent can be computed approximately in probabilistic polynomial time, up to an error of formula_5, where formula_6 is the value of the permanent and formula_7 is arbitrary. The permanent of a certain set of positive semidefinite matrices is NP-hard to approximate within any subexponential factor. If further conditions on the spectrum are imposed, the permanent can be approximated in probabilistic polynomial time: the best achievable error of this approximation is formula_8 (formula_6 is again the value of the permanent). The hardness in these instances is closely linked with difficulty of simulating boson sampling experiments.

==MacMahon&#x27;s master theorem==

Another way to view permanents is via multivariate generating functions. Let formula_10 be a square matrix of order &quot;n&quot;. Consider the multivariate generating function:
formula_11
The coefficient of formula_12 in formula_13 is perm(&quot;A&quot;).

As a generalization, for any sequence of &quot;n&quot; non-negative integers, formula_14 define:
formula_15 as the coefficient of formula_16 informula_17

MacMahon&#x27;s master theorem relating permanents and determinants is:
formula_18
where &quot;I&quot; is the order &quot;n&quot; identity matrix and &quot;X&quot; is the diagonal matrix with diagonal formula_19

==Rectangular matrices==
The permanent function can be generalized to apply to non-square matrices. Indeed, several authors make this the definition of a permanent and consider the restriction to square matrices a special case. Specifically, for an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_10 with &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, define
formula_21
where P(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) is the set of all &quot;m&quot;-permutations of the &quot;n&quot;-set {1,2...,n}.

Ryser&#x27;s computational result for permanents also generalizes. If &quot;A&quot; is an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix with &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, let formula_22 be obtained from &quot;A&quot; by deleting &quot;k&quot; columns, let formula_23 be the product of the row-sums of formula_22, and let formula_25 be the sum of the values of formula_23 over all possible formula_22. Then
formula_28

===Systems of distinct representatives===
The generalization of the definition of a permanent to non-square matrices allows the concept to be used in a more natural way in some applications. For instance:

Let &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, ..., &quot;S&quot;&quot;m&quot; be subsets (not necessarily distinct) of an &quot;n&quot;-set with &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. The incidence matrix of this collection of subsets is an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; (0,1)-matrix &quot;A&quot;. The number of systems of distinct representatives (SDR&#x27;s) of this collection is perm(&quot;A&quot;).

<doc id="215890" wikidata="Q1810439" url="?curid=215890" title="Local H">
<text>Local H is an American rock band co-founded in 1990 in Zion, Illinois by guitarist and vocalist Scott Lucas, who has remained the band&#x27;s sole consistent member. Following the departures of the early line-up&#x27;s bassist and lead guitarist, Lucas and co-founding drummer Joe Daniels continued as an unorthodox two-piece setup.

Local H signed a record contract with Island Records in 1994, where they would go on to release three albums. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ham Fisted&quot; (1995), was not a success and the band was nearly dropped, but the band remained on the label long enough to release their second album &quot;As Good as Dead&quot; (1996). The album was a success, selling over 320,000 copies and spawned a radio hit with &quot;Bound for the Floor&quot;, which peaked at No. 5 on the US Alternative &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart and became the band&#x27;s best known song. Local H&#x27;s third album, &quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot; (1998), was a critical success and appeared on several best-of end of year lists, but did not perform as well commercially due to its promotion being negatively affected by a corporate merger involving Island&#x27;s parent company, PolyGram. The following year, the band left Island, and Daniels was replaced by Brian St. Clair. By March 2002, Local H&#x27;s first three albums had sold a combined total of 600,000 copies. They have been based in Chicago since 1992.

Local H&#x27;s first album with St. Clair, &quot;Here Comes the Zoo&quot; (2002), was released through Palm Pictures. The band recorded three more albums, &quot;Whatever Happened to P.J. Soles?&quot; (2004), &quot;Twelve Angry Months&quot; (2008) and &quot;Hallelujah! I&#x27;m a Bum&quot; (2012), and four EPs with St. Clair, prior to his amicable departure in 2013. In November 2013, Ryan Harding was announced as the new drummer, and the band have since released two albums, &quot;Hey, Killer&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Lifers&quot; in 2020.

==History==
===Joe Daniels era (1987–1999)===
Local H formed as a result of a high school band that Scott Lucas and Matt Garcia were in called Rude Awakening, in 1987. That year, while attending high school in Zion, Scott Lucas and Joe Daniels began jamming together, along with Matt Garcia and John Sparkman. Local H was formed in 1990, performing their first show on April 20, 1990, at the University of Wisconsin in Whitewater. Sparkman left the band on April 4, 1991. Local H released &quot;Drum&quot;, their first extended play, in 1991. Garcia left on January 26, 1993, and Lucas and Daniels began looking for a replacement bassist. They eventually decided to carry on as a duo with Lucas handling bass guitar frequencies after having a high school friend, Tobey Flescher, modify his guitar with an added bass pickup and second output. Local H played their first show as a true duo on September 3, 1993.

By 1994, record labels were trying to capitalize on the popularity of harder-edged alt-rock bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Stone Temple Pilots, and the band caught the attention of Joe Bosso, an A&amp;R rep for Polydor Records, which was then in the process of merging with Island Records. Island released Local H&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Ham Fisted&quot; in January 1995, with the singles &quot;Cynic&quot; and &quot;Mayonnaise and Malaise,&quot; but the album failed to chart. Behind the scenes, Island pressured Bosso to drop the band; instead, Bosso pushed them into quickly recording a follow-up before Island could cancel their contract. Ahead of the release of &quot;As Good as Dead&quot;, Lucas was informed by Island that the album needed to sell at least 100,000 copies for the band to remain with the label. &quot;As Good as Dead&quot; achieved moderate commercial success behind the single &quot;Bound for the Floor&quot;, which rose to No. 5 on the US Alternative &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart and No. 10 on the US Hot Mainstream Rock &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart. The songs &quot;Eddie Vedder&quot; and &quot;Fritz&#x27;s Corner&quot; additionally made Top 40 on the Alternative and Mainstream Rock Billboard Charts. The album ultimately sold over 300,000 copies. 

Encouraged by the unexpected success of &quot;As Good as Dead&quot;, Island Records greenlit a third album with Local H&#x27;s preferred producer, Roy Thomas Baker, along with a larger budget and a promise of no interference. That album, &quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot;, was a 15-track concept album chronicling the rise and fall of a rock band. Island expected it to be a major success and intended to heavily promote it, with &quot;All the Kids Are Right&quot; as its leadoff single. This plan was derailed, however, when Island Records&#x27; parent company, Polygram, was acquired by Universal Music Group. The promotional campaign was canceled and everyone at Island that the band had worked with, including Bosso, were fired or quit. &quot;Pack Up The Cats&quot; was released September 1, 1998, peaking at number 140 on the Billboard 200 and staying on the chart for only two weeks, despite &quot;All the Kids Are Right&quot; achieving moderate success on MTV. Universal did not release a second single. The album was critically acclaimed and ranked on several best-of year-end lists, and in a retrospective &quot;Vulture&quot; suggested &quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot; might have been a landmark album of &#x27;90s rock comparable to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; or Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot; had its release been handled differently.

In July 1999, Daniels left the group.

===Brian St. Clair era (1999–2013)===
Intending to continue the band, Lucas hired Triple Fast Action drummer Brian St. Clair, who had previously worked as a drum tech for Cheap Trick. The pair began working on new material for a fourth album, but confidence in the band at Universal was low and the label made them perform showcases for executives, something typically reserved for new bands trying to earn their first contracts. Increasingly disillusioned with being signed to a major label, Lucas submitted new demos to Universal and invited the label to drop the band if they were not onboard, which Universal did.

Local H signed with Palm Pictures to release their fourth album, &quot;Here Comes the Zoo&quot;, in 2002. &quot;The No Fun EP&quot; followed in 2003 and their fifth album, &quot;Whatever Happened to P.J. Soles?&quot;, was released in April 2004 to favorable reviews.

In 2005, the band received a good deal of publicity after recording a cover of the Britney Spears single &quot;Toxic.&quot; The track was the only studio recording featured on &quot;Alive &#x27;05&quot;, a 2005 live album that constituted the sixth major release from the band.

In 2008 the band released their sixth studio album &quot;Twelve Angry Months&quot;, a concept album in which each of the twelve songs represented a stage in a year long process of overcoming a failed relationship.

On April 5, 2011, the ICON release of the band&#x27;s Island recordings became their first &quot;best-of&quot; compilation. In an April 22 interview with &quot;The Delaware County Daily Times&quot;, Lucas commented, &quot;It&#x27;s kinda weird but kinda cool because it doesn’t cover our entire career, so I was like, &#x27;Let&#x27;s call it The Island Years.&#x27;&quot;

In a June 28 guest appearance on the movie review podcast/website &quot;CinemaJaw,&quot; Lucas claimed that the next album would be out before the upcoming 2012 elections—mainly because so much of the album&#x27;s content deals with it directly—expecting it to be released by February 2012. In the same interview, Lucas also suggested that a working title for the album was &quot;Hallelujah, I&#x27;m a Bum&quot;, named for a song from the Depression Era. On July 11, 2012, the band announced that their next studio effort, &quot;Hallelujah! I&#x27;m a Bum&quot;, would be released on September 18. A full track listing was also published.

In May 2012, the band launched a tour of small clubs and bars in preparation for release of a new album. In September 2016, Local H announced a North American club tour supporting Helmet.

On August 21, 2013, it was announced that St. Clair would be leaving the band after a brief farewell tour, in order to focus on his tour management company, Tour Time Productions. The departure was described as amicable and a mutual decision between Lucas and St. Clair.

===Ryan Harding era (2013–present)===
On November 4, 2013, Ryan Harding was announced as the new drummer. Previously, Harding had played with Sullen (Shanna Kiel from Sullen performed on &quot;5th Ave. Crazy&quot; from &quot;Here Comes the Zoo&quot; in 2001) and Short &amp; Sweet, who had opened for Local H. Nobody else was auditioned or considered, and Harding&#x27;s first show with the band was on November 8, 2013. On April 22, 2014 the band released a studio single of their cover of the Lorde song &quot;Team&quot;. In early 2015, the duo created a Pledgemusic campaign in order to help fund the production of their new album, titled &quot;Hey, Killer&quot;. The album was released on April 15, 2015 through G&amp;P Records.

On March 29, 2016, Lucas announced on WKQX that the band would celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;As Good As Dead&quot; by playing shows where they perform the entire AGAD album with original drummer Joe Daniels in addition to other songs with Harding on drums.

In April 2017, Local H was announced as the winner of the &#x27;Hit the Stage&#x27; contest, gaining the opportunity to open for Metallica on five dates of the WorldWired tour.

On January 1, 2018, the band announced a new live album from their 2017 European tour. The album, &quot;Live in Europe&quot;, was released on February 6, 2018.

On January 6, 2019, the band performed as the halftime entertainment of the Chicago Bears vs. Philadelphia Eagles NFL Wildcard Playoff game.

In January 2020, the band premiered a new single entitled &quot;Turn the Bow&quot;, as well as announced an upcoming studio album entitled &quot;LIFERS,&quot; set to be released in April of the same year. The album was produced by veteran audio engineers Steve Albini and Andy Gerber, features members of Deer Tick and Naked Raygun, and was mixed by J. Robbins. On March 23, 2020, the band released the live video for their single &quot;Hold That Thought.&quot; &quot;LIFERS&quot; was released on April 10, 2020.

On October 22, 2021, the band performed at the Shaky Knees Music Festival.

==Live shows==

Local H is known for their frequent and energetic live shows. The members of the band can usually be found at their own merchandise table after shows, signing autographs and selling band T-shirts.

Local H also has a reputation for creative ideas with regards to its live shows. In addition to playing a show in Chicago every New Year&#x27;s Eve, the band has also participated in several unconventional concerts over the years, such as allowing one fan to select an album name from a hat, and then playing that album in its entirety. In 2005, Local H performed an &quot;all request tour&quot; in which a ballot containing a breakdown of most of the bands&#x27; songs organized into various categories, resembling a traditional sushi menu, was handed out to the audience upon admittance to the venue. Audiences were allowed to pick seven songs from the &quot;menu&quot; and the setlist for each show was derived from these ballots.

In 2003, the band auctioned off a live show to the winner of an eBay auction. The band subsequently performed this concert at Duke O&#x27;Briens, a pub in Crystal Lake, IL.

In July 2007, Local H played an early morning show at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago at the conclusion of the Nike Rock &#x27;N Run 5K race, where runners ended the race on the field. Tickets to this show were only available by spotting Scott Lucas in public and speaking the phrase &quot;Attention all planets of the Solar Federation, we have assumed control&quot; directly to him. Later that same year, Local H announced a contest in which fans could make videos of themselves covering Local H songs. The winner would then get to be the opening act for Local H&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve show later that year. A band from New York called Kung-Fu Grip won the contest with their cover of a song from Local H&#x27;s &quot;No Fun&quot; E.P.

During the spring months of 2010, Local H embarked on their &quot;6 Angry Records&quot; Tour. Each show began with Scott holding a hat filled with slips of paper containing the band&#x27;s album names. After interviewing members of the audience about which album they&#x27;d like to hear, one audience member would choose an album from the hat. The band would then play that album on the spot in its entirety, followed by an encore of other Local H favorites and covers.

<text>Starvation is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake, below the level needed to maintain an organism&#x27;s life. It is the most extreme form of malnutrition. In humans, prolonged starvation can cause permanent organ damage and eventually, death. The term inanition refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation. Starvation by outside forces is a crime according to international criminal law and may also be used as a means of torture or execution.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hunger is the single gravest threat to the world&#x27;s public health. The WHO also states that malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Undernutrition is a contributory factor in the death of 3.1 million children under five every year. The results also demonstrates that as global hunger levels have stabilized, however, despite some progress in specific areas such as stunting and exclusive breastfeeding, an alarming number of people still face food insecurity and malnutrition. In fact, the world has been set back 15 years, with levels of undernourishment similar to those in 2008-2009, with between 713 and 757 million people undernourished in 2023, and over 152 million more than in 2019 when the mid-range was 733 million.

The bloated stomach represents a form of malnutrition called kwashiorkor. The exact pathogenesis of kwashiorkor is not clear, as initially it was thought to relate to diets high in carbohydrates (e.g. maize) but low in protein. While many patients have low albumin, this is thought to be a consequence of the condition. Possible causes such as aflatoxin poisoning, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, and altered gut microbiota have been suggested. Treatment can help mitigate symptoms such as the pictured weight loss and muscle wasting, however prevention is of utmost importance.

Without any food, humans usually die in around 2 months. There was a case when someone survived over a year (382 days) under medical supervision. Lean people can usually survive with a loss of up to 18% of their body mass; obese people can tolerate more, possibly over 20%. Females may survive longer than males due to their higher body fat content at the same BMI.

==Signs and symptoms==
The following are some of the symptoms of starvation:

=== Changes in behaviour or mental status ===
The beginning stages of starvation impact mental status and behaviours. These symptoms show up as irritable and/or unstable mood, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and preoccupation with food thoughts. People with those symptoms tend to be easily distracted and have no energy. Psychological effects are profound, including depression, anxiety, and a decrease in cognitive functions.

=== Physical signs ===
As starvation progresses, the physical symptoms set in. The timing of these symptoms depends on age, size, and overall health. It usually takes days to weeks, and includes weakness, fast heart rate, shallow breaths that are slowed, thirst, and constipation. There may also be diarrhea in some cases. The eyes begin to sink in and glass over. The muscles begin to become smaller and muscle wasting sets in. Tiredness and dizziness also commonly occur, especially from any physical task. The skin is often overly pale. One prominent sign in children is a swollen belly. Skin loosens and turns pale in color, and there may be swelling of the feet and ankles.

=== Weakened immune system ===
Symptoms of starvation may also appear as a weakened immune system, slow wound healing, and poor response to infection. Rashes may develop on the skin. The body directs any nutrients available to keeping organs functioning.

=== Other symptoms ===
Other effects of starvation may include:

* Anemia
* Gallstones
* Hypotension
* Stomach disease
* Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases
* Irregular or absent menstrual periods in women
* Kidney disease or failure
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Emaciation
* Oliguria

=== Stages of starvation ===
The symptoms of starvation show up in three stages. Phase one and two can show up in anyone that skips meals, diets, and goes through fasting. Phase three is more severe, can be fatal, and results from long-term starvation.

Phase one: When meals are skipped, the body begins to maintain blood sugar levels by degrading glycogen in the liver and breaking down stored fat and protein. The liver can provide glucose for the first few hours. After that, the body begins to break down fat and protein. The body uses fatty acids as an energy source for muscles but lowers the amount of glucose sent to the brain. Another chemical that comes from fatty acids is glycerol. It can be used as glucose for energy but eventually runs out.

Phase two: Phase two can last for weeks at a time. In this phase, the body mainly uses stored fat for energy. The breakdown occurs in the liver and turns fat into ketones. After fasting for one week, the brain will use these ketones and any available glucose. Using ketones lowers the need for glucose, and the body slows the breakdown of proteins.

Phase three: By this point, the fat stores are gone, and the body begins to turn to stored protein for energy. This means it needs to break down muscle tissues full of protein; the muscles break down very quickly. Protein is essential for cells to work correctly, and when it runs out, the cells can no longer function.

The cause of death due to starvation is usually an infection or the result of tissue breakdown. This is due to the body becoming unable to produce enough energy to fight off bacteria and viruses. The final stage of starvation includes signals like hair color loss, skin flaking, swelling in the extremities, and a bloated belly. Even though they may feel hunger, people in the final stage of starvation usually cannot eat enough food to recover without significant medical intervention.

==Causes==
Starvation occurs when the body expends more energy than it takes in for an extended period of time. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions or circumstantial situations, which can include:

Medical reasons
*Anorexia nervosa
*Bulimia nervosa
*Eating disorder, not otherwise specified
*Celiac disease
*Major depressive disorder
*Diabetes mellitus
*Digestive disease
*Constant vomiting

Circumstantial causes
*Child, elder, or dependent abuse
*Famine for any reason, such as political strife and war
*Hunger striking
*Excessive fasting
*Poverty
*Torture

==Biochemistry==

With a typical high-carbohydrate diet, the human body relies on free blood glucose as its primary energy source. Glucose can be obtained directly from dietary sugars and by the breakdown of other carbohydrates. In the absence of dietary sugars and carbohydrates, glucose is obtained from the breakdown of stored glycogen. Glycogen is a readily-accessible storage form of glucose, stored in notable quantities in the liver and skeletal muscle.

After the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next two to three days, fatty acids become the principal metabolic fuel. At first, the brain continues to use glucose. If a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off. Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain.

After two or three days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize ketone bodies from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for three days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After four days, this may increase to 70% or more. Thus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain&#x27;s glucose requirement from 80 g per day to 30 g per day, about 35% of normal, with 65% derived from ketone bodies. But of the brain&#x27;s remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from glycerol (itself a product of fat breakdown). This still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must be supplied from another source; this other source will be the body&#x27;s own proteins.

After exhaustion of fat stores, the cells in the body begin to break down protein. This releases alanine and lactate produced from pyruvate, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to choose which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2–3 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued, in order to conserve protein.

Starvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left. In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted faster, and the protein, sooner, therefore death occurs sooner. Ultimately, the cause of death is in general cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, brought on by tissue degradation and electrolyte imbalances. Conditions like metabolic acidosis may also kill starving people.

==Prevention==

Starvation can be caused by factors beyond the control of the individual. The Rome Declaration on World Food Security outlines several policies aimed at increasing food security and, consequently, preventing starvation. These include:
*Poverty reduction
*Prevention of wars and political instability
*Food aid
*Agricultural sustainability
*Reduction of economic inequality

Supporting farmers in areas of food insecurity through such measures as free or subsidized fertilizers and seeds increases food harvest and reduces food prices.

Starvation is commonly used as a method of warfare, however, it has been outlawed and is now a crime. Notable incidents in history include the blockade of Germany and blockade of Biafra.

==Treatment==
Patients that suffer from starvation can be treated, but this must be done cautiously to avoid refeeding syndrome. Rest and warmth must be provided and maintained. Food can be given gradually in small quantities. The quantity of food can be increased over time. Proteins may be administered intravenously to raise the level of serum proteins. For worse situations, hospice care and opioid medications can be used.

===Organizations===

Many organizations have been highly effective at reducing starvation in different regions. Aid agencies give direct assistance to individuals, while political organizations pressure political leaders to enact more macro-scale policies that will reduce famine and provide aid.

==Statistics==
According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization, between 720 and 811 million people were affected by hunger globally in 2020. This was a decrease from estimated 925 million in 2010 and roughly 1 billion in 2009. In 2007, 923 million people were reported as being undernourished, an increase of 80 million since 1990–92.
An estimated 820 million people did not have enough to eat in 2018, up from 811 million in the previous year, which is the third year of increase in a row.

As the definitions of starving and malnourished people are different, the number of starving people is different from that of malnourished. Generally, far fewer people are starving than are malnourished.

The proportion of malnourished and starving people in the world has been more or less continually decreasing for at least several centuries. This is due to an increasing supply of food and to overall gains in economic efficiency. In 40 years, the proportion of malnourished people in the developing world has been more than halved. The proportion of starving people has decreased even faster.

==Capital punishment==

Historically, starvation has been used as a death sentence. From the beginning of civilization to the Middle Ages, people were immured, and died for want of food.

In ancient Greco-Roman societies, starvation was sometimes used to dispose of guilty upper-class citizens, especially erring female members of patrician families. In the year 31, Livilla, the niece and daughter-in-law of Tiberius, was discreetly starved to death by her mother for her adulterous relationship with Sejanus and for her complicity in the murder of her own husband, Drusus the Younger.

Another daughter-in-law of Tiberius, named Agrippina the Elder (a granddaughter of Augustus and the mother of Caligula), also died of starvation, in 33 AD; however, it is unclear if her starvation was self-inflicted.

A son and daughter of Agrippina were also executed by starvation for political reasons; Drusus Caesar, her second son, was put in prison in 33 AD, and starved to death by orders of Tiberius (he managed to stay alive for nine days by chewing the stuffing of his bed); Agrippina&#x27;s youngest daughter, Julia Livilla, was exiled on an island in 41 by her uncle, Emperor Claudius, and her death by starvation was arranged by the empress Messalina.

It is also possible that Vestal Virgins were starved when found guilty of breaking their vows of celibacy.

Ugolino della Gherardesca, his sons, and other members of his family were immured in the Muda, a tower of Pisa, and starved to death in the thirteenth century. Dante, his contemporary, wrote about Gherardesca in his masterpiece &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;.

In Sweden in 1317, King Birger of Sweden imprisoned his two brothers for a coup they had staged several years earlier (Nyköping Banquet). According to legend they died of starvation a few weeks later, since their brother had thrown the prison key in the castle moat.

In Cornwall in the UK in 1671, John Trehenban from St Columb Major was condemned to be starved to death in a cage at Castle An Dinas for the murder of two girls.

The Makah, a Native American tribe inhabiting the Pacific Northwest near the modern border of Canada and the United States, practiced death by starvation as a punishment for slaves.

<text>The Olympic Mountains are a mountain range on the Olympic Peninsula of the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The mountains, part of the Pacific Coast Ranges, are not especially high – Mount Olympus is the highest summit at ; however, the eastern slopes rise precipitously out of Puget Sound from sea level, and the western slopes are separated from the Pacific Ocean by the low-lying wide Pacific Ocean coastal plain. These densely forested western slopes are the wettest place in the 48 contiguous states. Most of the mountains are protected within the bounds of Olympic National Park and adjoining segments of Olympic National Forest.

The mountains are located in western Washington in the United States, spread out across four counties: Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson and Mason. Physiographically, they are a section of the larger Pacific Border province, which is in turn a part of the larger Pacific Mountain System.

== Geography ==

The Olympics have the form of a domed cluster of steep-sided peaks surrounded by heavily forested foothills and incised by deep valleys. They are surrounded by water on three sides, separated from the Pacific by the wide coastal plain. The general form of the range is more or less circular, or somewhat horseshoe-shaped, and the drainage pattern is radial.

Rivers radiate outwards to all sides. Clockwise from windward to leeward, the major watersheds are: Satsop, Wynoochee, Humptulips, Quinault, Queets, Hoh, Bogachiel, Sol Duc (all flowing west into the Pacific Ocean; with the Satsop, Wynoochee by way of the Chehalis River, the Humptulips by way of Grays Harbor at the mouth of the Chehalis River, and the Bogachiel and Sol Duc forming the Quillayute River within of tidewater), Lyre, Elwha, Dungeness (all flowing north into the Strait of Juan de Fuca), Big Quilcene, Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hamma Hamma, and Skokomish (all flowing east into Hood Canal).

===List of summits===
Principal summits: 
* Mount Olympus – highest point, eight glaciers
* Mount Constance – tallest visible from Seattle and third highest Olympic peak
* Mount Townsend – highly visible from Seattle at far northeast of the Olympics (technically in the Buckhorn Wilderness)
* Mount Anderson – West Peak of Mount Anderson is the hydrographic apex of the Olympic Mountains: From this peak, rivers flow outward to the Pacific Ocean, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Hood Canal.
* The Brothers – double peak visible from Seattle
* Mount Deception – second highest Olympic peak
* Mount Washington
* Mount Angeles
* Mount Stone
* Mount Ellinor

Other summits:
*Boulder Peak – located in the Elwha River area
*Mount Storm King – located above the east end of Lake Crescent
*Hurricane Ridge – road accessible mountain viewpoint near Port Angeles

===Other features===
* Bailey Range
* Lost Pass

===Protected areas===
A large portion of the range is contained within the Olympic National Park. Of this portion, 95% is part of the Daniel J. Evans Wilderness.

The national park is surrounded on the south, east, and northwest sides by the Olympic National Forest, with five wilderness areas, and on the southwest side by the Clearwater State Forest with one Natural Area Preserve (Washington Department of Natural Resources), and the Quinault Indian Reservation. State parks and wildlife areas occur in the lower elevations.

===Climate===

Precipitation varies greatly throughout the range, from the wet western slopes to the semi-arid eastern ridges. Mount Olympus, nearly tall, is a mere from the Pacific Ocean, one of the steepest reliefs globally and accounting for the high precipitation of the area, with an estimated of snow and rain on Mount Olympus. of rain falls on the Hoh Rainforest annually, receiving the most measured precipitation of anywhere in the contiguous United States. Areas to the northeast of the mountains are located in a rain shadow cast by the mountain themselves, and receive as little as of precipitation around the city of Sequim. Annual precipitation increases to about on the edges of the rain shadow around Port Townsend, the San Juan Islands, and the city of Everett across Puget Sound. 80% of precipitation falls during the winter months. On the coastal plain, the winter temperature stays between . During the summer it warms up to between , with occasional hot spell days reaching to the upper 80s to low 90s °F (30–35 °C).

The large number of snowfields and glaciers, reaching down to 1,500 m (5,000 ft) above sea level, are a consequence of the high precipitation, northern latitude, and cool moderating climate adjacent to the Pacific Ocean. There are about 184 glaciers and permanent ice fields crowning the Olympics peaks. The most prominent glaciers are those on Mount Olympus covering approximately . Beyond the Olympic complex are the glaciers of Mount Carrie and others in the Bailey Range, Mount Christie, Mount Queets, and Mount Anderson, however most of these have experienced significant decrease in both length and mass in recent decades, with several disappearing completely in the driest northeastern portion of the mountains.

== Geology ==

The Olympics are made up of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust. They are primarily Eocene sandstones, turbidites, and basaltic oceanic crust. Unlike the Cascades, the Olympic Mountains are not volcanic, and contain no native granite.

Millions of years ago, vents and fissures opened under the Pacific Ocean and lava flowed forth, creating huge underwater volcanic mountains and ranges called seamounts. The Farallon tectonic plate that formed a part of the Pacific Ocean floor (separate from the Pacific plate) inched eastward toward North America about 35 million years ago and most of the sea floor subducted beneath the continental land mass of the North America plate. Some of the sea floor, however, was scraped off and jammed against the mainland, creating the dome that was the forerunner of today&#x27;s Olympics. In this particular case, the future Olympics were being jammed into a corner created by the Vancouver Island and North Cascades microcontinents attached to the western edge of the North America plate. This is thought to be the origin of the curved shape of the Olympic Basaltic Horseshoe, an arc of submarine basalt running east along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, south along Hood Canal, and then west to Lake Quinault. Thrust-faulting northeast into the Vancouver Island/North Cascades corner pushes Olympic rock upward and southwestward, resulting in strata that appear to be standing on edge and that intermix with strata of different mineral composition. All this occurred under water; the Olympics began to rise above the sea only 10–20 million years ago.

The Olympics were shaped in the Pleistocene era by both alpine and continental glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times. The valleys of the Hoh, Queets, and Quinault rivers are typical U-shaped valleys carved by advancing alpine glaciers. Piles of talus and rockfall were created by retreating alpine glaciers. In the high mountains, the major rivers have their headwaters in alpine glacially carved cirques. During the Orting, followed by the Stuck, the Salmon Springs, and the Fraser glaciations, the vast continental Cordilleran Ice Sheet descended from Alaska south through British Columbia to the Olympics. The ice split into the Juan de Fuca and Puget ice lobes, as they encountered the resistant Olympic Mountains, carving out the current waterways and advanced as far south as present day Olympia. Ice flowed up the river valleys as far as , carrying granitic glacial erratics with it.

==Ecology==
The mountains support a variety of different ecosystems, varying by elevation and relative east–west location, which influences the local climate, primarily precipitation.

===Flora===

Olympic forests are coniferous forests, unique among mesic temperate forests in their almost complete dominance by conifers rather than by hardwoods. The hardwood:conifer timber volume ratio is 1:1,000 in the maritime Pacific Northwest.
Another unique feature of Olympic forests is the size and longevity of the dominant tree species. Every coniferous genus represented here is represented by its largest and longest-lived species, and some of its second and third ranked species as well. Biomass accumulations are among the highest in the temperate forest zones.
Dominance of conifers is thought to be a result of the amount and timing of precipitation. The dry summers limit the growth of deciduous trees, such as most hardwoods. Evergreens, such as most conifers, are able to take advantage of the winter precipitation by continuing to photosynthesize through fall, winter and early spring, when deciduous trees are not able to photosynthesize. No deciduous conifers occur in the Olympics; larch trees occur in the much-drier eastern Cascades, but not in the Olympics or western Cascades. There is only one species of evergreen hardwood, the madrone.
The great size and age of conifers here is thought to be a result of the relative lack of frequent windstorms like tropical cyclones.

Along the western flanks of the mountains the increased orographic precipitation supports temperate rain forests in the Quinault, Queets, Hoh, and Bogachiel river valleys at low elevations. Protection by Olympic National Park has allowed these rain forests to retain old growth trees, which supports a varied ecosystem. The Olympic rain forests are composed primarily of Sitka spruce and western hemlock, as are the surrounding lowland Sitka spruce forests, but are distinct in having a relative abundance of groves of bigleaf maple and vine maple, which support large epiphytic communities of mosses, lichens, ferns, and clubmosses; an abundance of nurse logs on the forest floor; a relatively open forest canopy and sparse shrub layer; and a dense moss layer on the forest floor. The rain forests are the wintering grounds for herds of Roosevelt elk and it is thought that browsing by the elk is responsible for the open shrub layer and the dominance of Sitka spruce over western hemlock.

The rain forests are just one type of forest found in the Olympic Mountains. Franklin and Dyrness set out 5 forest zones: Sitka spruce, western hemlock, silver fir, mountain hemlock, and subalpine parkland. Other authors include a sixth, Douglas-fir zone. Different plant associations are typical of one or more forest zones. For instance, the rain forest plant association described above is a member of the Sitka spruce forest zone.

The Sitka spruce zone is a lowland zone dominated by Sitka spruce and western hemlock. Precipitation is high, winters are mild, elevations are low. This forest zone is typically found at very low elevations on the western coastal plain and not in mountainous areas, although it can be found as high as .

The lower elevations of the Olympic mountains, from roughly up to – , feature the western hemlock zone, so-called because in most of the zone, the climax tree species would be western hemlock, even though much of the area is dominated by Douglas-fir. The reason for this is that Douglas-fir is an early seral species, and reproduces primarily after disturbances such as fire, logging, landslides, and windstorms. Western hemlock does not reproduce well on disturbed, exposed soil but germinates under the canopy of Douglas-fir, eventually overtaking the forest by shading out the Douglas-fir, which cannot reproduce in shade. In this zone, despite the high annual precipitation, drought stress in summer is sufficiently severe to limit growth of many species, such as Sitka spruce. Hardwoods such as bigleaf maple, willows, and red alder are limited to disturbed sites and riparian areas. red-cedar grows in the wettest sites. A very small area of the northeastern rain shadow contains the limited Douglas-fir zone, where it is too dry for western hemlock.

Moving up in elevation and moisture availability is the silver fir zone, up to about . This zone gets more precipitation, and more of it as snow, than the lower, warmer, drier western hemlock zone. The cold and the snowpack combine to limit growth of lower-elevation plants. On the other hand, silver fir is less drought tolerant and less fire tolerant than either Douglas-fir or western hemlock. Slide alder (&quot;Alnus viridis sinuata&quot;) grows in snow-creep areas and avalanche chutes, along with yellow-cedar. Meadows of thimbleberry also grow in this zone, often intergrading between the slide alder chutes and the silver fir forest.

The next highest forest zone is the mountain hemlock zone, the highest forest zone in the Olympic mountains. In this zone most precipitation falls as snow and the snow-free growing season is very short. In the drier rainshadow side of the mountains, mountain hemlock is largely replaced by subalpine fir. At the higher elevations of the mountain hemlock/subalpine fir zone, tree cover is reduced to isolated stands of trees called tree islands, surrounded by subalpine meadows, in the subalpine parkland zone. Variations in substrate, topography, moisture, and snowpack depth and duration determine the vegetation community. Tree islands form on convex topography, which tends to gather less snow and shed it sooner than surrounding level or concave topography.

In the west, the subalpine zone is dominated by mountain hemlock. It occurs along with subalpine fir from in the Bailey Range; however, the range of this forest type is not extensive and does not extend much west of Mount Olympus, nor is it common in the east. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis|Yellow-cedar is sometimes found in relation to these plants. In the east and other drier areas, the subalpine zone is dominated by subalpine fir. It can occur with other trees, including mountain hemlock, silver fir, and yellow-cedar, but what characterizes these zones is the dominance of subalpine fir. These forests occur on the eastern ridges from .

In the Olympics, the treeline is between and but can be as low as under in some places. Treeline is a function of both elevation and precipitation, particularly the amount of snow that falls each winter. The growing season for trees is relatively short in the higher elevations of the windward Olympics, compared to similar elevations in other mountain ranges, due to the large accumulations of snow that take a long time to melt each year.

Subalpine meadows in the Olympic mountains are of 5 types. Heath shrub meadows are dominated by ericaceous huckleberries and heathers. Lush herbaceous meadows are typified by Sitka valerian and showy sedge. Drier areas or those with longer snow cover grow dwarf sedge (&quot;Carex nigricans&quot;) or grass (&quot;Festuca viridis&quot;) meadows. &quot;Phlox diffusa&quot; typifies the low herbaceous meadows of pumice, talus and scree slopes and other rocky areas. American saw-wort is common in both mountain meadows and lower subalpine parklands in the Olympics.

Above timberline is the Alpine zone, not a forest zone since no trees can grow this high. The alpine zone in the Olympics is much more limited in size than in other temperate mountain ranges, from to . The high precipitation of the Olympics creates permanent snow and ice at lower elevations than is typical for other mountain ranges, cutting off the alpine vegetation zone. Most of the alpine vegetation is on the rain shadow side, in the northeastern Olympics, where there is less permanent snow and ice. Alpine vegetation is low herbaceous, typified by &quot;Phlox diffusa&quot; and species of &quot;Carex&quot;. Many of the Olympic Mountain&#x27;s endemic plants occur here, such as Piper&#x27;s bellflower (&quot;Campanula piperi&quot;) and Olympic violet (&quot;Viola flettii&quot;).

===Fauna===
Mammals extirpated from the Olympic Mountains are the fisher (&quot;Martes pennanti&quot;) and the gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;). The fisher was declared extirpated from Washington State when no fishers were detected during statewide carnivore surveys in the 1990s and 2000s. A reintroduction project was initiated in 2007, in partnership with Olympic National Park. The gray wolf was extirpated from Washington State in the early 20th century. The last wolf documented in the Olympics was trapped in 1920. In the early 21st century, wolves are naturally migrating back into eastern and north-central Washington State, but there is no evidence of wolf migration into the Olympics and no plan to trans-locate wolves to the Olympics.

;Carnivores
The gray wolf is listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the fisher is listed as state endangered by the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission.

Previous to the extirpation of the gray wolf, coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) occurred in the lowlands of the Olympic peninsula but not in the mountains. With the absence of wolves, coyotes have been moving up into the higher elevations of the mountains and may be responsible for population declines in the Olympic marmot.

American black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) are numerous in the Olympics. Olympic bears eat salmon, rodents, huckleberries, tree bark, insects, and deer or elk carcasses.

Cougar (&quot;Felis concolor&quot;) is the largest carnivore in the Olympics. Their main prey are deer and elk but they also hunt porcupines and insects. They are rarely &quot;seen&quot;, but are thought to be widespread and relatively common in the Olympics.

;Mountain goats
The mountain goat (&quot;Oreamnos americanus&quot;) is not native to the Olympic Mountains but was introduced for hunting in the 1920s by a coalition of the Forest Service, the Clallam County Game Warden, and the State Game Commission. Mountain goats in the Olympics have been associated with damage to alpine vegetation and soil erosion.

The goats have also been aggressive towards park visitors. In 1999, a mountain goat gored a hiker at the summit of Mount Ellinor in Olympic National Forest, and in 2010, a mountain goat fatally gored a hiker on the Klahane Ridge trail in Olympic National Park. In 2012, the trail to Mount Ellinor was closed in summer due to aggressive goats, re-opening in the fall.

An airlifting effort by the National Park Service started in September 2018 in an attempt to relocate the goats to the Cascades region. NPS hopes to relocate several hundred goats before starting a lethal removal option. The park service hopes to reduce the goat population to 0–50 animals by 2028.

;Elk
Roosevelt elk &quot;Cervus canadensis roosevelti&quot; range along the Pacific coast from the Russian River to Vancouver Island. Olympic and Vancouver Island elk are some of the last pure Roosevelt elk herds left; those in the Cascades have mixed with Rocky Mountain elk. Olympic National Park has the largest population of Roosevelt elk in the world. Some herds spend winter in lowland valleys, summer in high country, in subalpine meadows. Other herds live year-round in lowland forests and meadows. Elk prefer more humid areas, the Sitka spruce, wet western hemlock, and mountain hemlock zones.

Elk browsing is believed to be responsible for the open park-like structure of the Olympic rainforests; the elk graze on hemlock and shrubs, leaving the Sitka spruce to grow. Elk browsing also increases diversity of grasses and forbs. Elk exclosure experiments in rainforest valleys show more species of vegetation growing outside the exclosures, where elk browse, than inside; while there are more brush and saplings inside exclosures, there are more grasses and forbs outside. Elk browsing improves foraging for other herbivores like deer, voles and snowshoe hares. Elk prefer old growth forest and young alder groves over the large, even-aged plantations common on commercial timber land, although they will use small, recent clearcuts where they mimic natural forest openings.

Both the Press and O&#x27;Neil expeditions were impressed by the quantity and tameness of the elk. Both expedition leaders prohibited shooting the elk and deer except when the expedition was in need of meat. The Olympic National Monument was formed to protect the elk after the herds were reduced to less than 2000 animals. The population rebounded, and in 1937 a hunting season for elk was opened in the Hoh River valley.

An estimated 2,000–4,000 hunters came for the 1937 hunting season, several times as many as expected; the excess was a logistical nightmare. One hunter was accidentally shot and died. A second hunter drowned in the Hoh River. A pack horse was shot. The Hoh River flooded, stranding hunters and washing away their camps. Forest Service and State Game personnel were overwhelmed with rescue efforts (lost, stranded, or injured hunters) and dispute resolution. Over 800 elk were killed, some left lying in the forest. Proponents of a national park used the 1937 elk hunt as an argument in favor of permanent protection for Olympic&#x27;s elk herds. Not all the elk herds are protected inside the national park: Some migrate in and out of the park, and others live entirely outside the park. All elk are subject to regulated hunting when outside the national park.

;Mule deer
Blacktail deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus&quot;) prefer drier areas than elk, such as the dry western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and subalpine fir zones. Similar to the elk, blacktail deer winter in lowlands, or along south-facing ridges, and summer in the high country meadows.

;Others
Mountain beaver (&quot;Aplodontia rufa&quot;) is a large primitive rodent endemic to the Pacific Northwest. They are common in the Olympics, preferring wet scrubby thickets and second growth timber.

Banana slug (&quot;Ariolimax columbianus&quot;) is another Pacific Northwest endemic. Slugs are abundant in the Olympic forests, outweighing mammals and birds combined. They thrive in the cool damp shade of the forests. The banana slug is the largest and most conspicuous of Olympic slugs.

Northern spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis caurina&quot;) is an old-growth dependent species and is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The majority of spotted owls on the Olympic peninsula, along with the largest preserve of temperate old-growth forest, live in the national park. Spotted owls prey on flying squirrels and snowshoe hares, and are themselves preyed on by great horned owls &quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;. The density of the canopy of an old-growth forest gives the spotted owls some protection from the larger, less agile great horned owls.

Rufous hummingbird (&quot;Selasphorus rufus&quot;) is the only hummingbird in the Olympics. They overwinter in Mexico and southern California, arriving in the Olympics in February or March with the flowering of the Indian plum &quot;Oemleria cerasifera&quot;.

Harlequin duck (&quot;Histrionicus histrionicus&quot;) breeds in fast-moving mountain streams in the Olympics. They spend the rest of the year in coastal waters.

Osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) and bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) fish in Olympic rivers, nesting in large old trees. Both are relatively common, the bald eagle more so along the coast than in the mountains.

Olympic rivers are dominated by Pacific salmonids, the &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;. Chinook, coho, pink, rainbow and steelhead, and cutthroat all spawn in Olympic rivers. Chum and sockeye also live in coastal Olympic peninsula rivers but do not reach into the mountains. Bull trout (&quot;Salvelinus confluentus&quot;) and Dolly Varden trout (&quot;S. malma&quot;) also live in Olympic rivers.

====Endemic fauna====
There are at least 16 endemic animal species.

;Mammals

*Olympic marmot (&quot;Marmota olympus&quot;)
*Olympic chipmunk (&quot;Neotamias amoenus caurinus&quot;)
*Olympic snow mole (&quot;Scapanus townsendii olympicus&quot;)

;Near-endemic
Near-endemics, those that occur in the Olympics as well as other parts of a limited range, include the Cope&#x27;s giant salamander (&quot;Dicamptodon copei&quot;), and the Van Dyke&#x27;s salamander (&quot;Plethodon vandykei&quot;,) both found primarily in the Olympics and other mountainous areas of western Washington; the tailed frog (&quot;Ascaphus truei&quot;), of Pacific Northwest mountain streams, and the mountain beaver (&quot;Aplodontia rufa&quot;) of the coastal Pacific Northwest.

==History==

For the original inhabitants of the Olympic Peninsula, the highest peaks of the mountains were the only refuges during the Great Floods at the beginning of time. For the Elwha Klallam people, that peak was Mount Carrie; for the Skokomish, it was a peak west of Mount Ellinor. The Thunderbird figure of the Hoh tribe lived on Mount Olympus, in a den under Blue Glacier. People in the Skokomish, Quinault, and Elwha watersheds regularly traveled into the high country to hunt elk, gather huckleberries and beargrass, and perform spirit quests. Trails across the mountains allowed members of the various tribes to visit and trade with each other. The cross-Olympic expeditions of the 1890s found tree blazes that they took to mark Indian trails.

Archeological evidence shows that the Olympic Mountains were inhabited by Paleolithic hunters after the retreat of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Stone tools in the Deer Park area date to 7600 years ago, prior to the volcanic eruption of Mount Mazama. Similar tools have been found near Lake Cushman and throughout the Olympic subalpine meadows and ridges, as well as in coastal areas. In addition, a fragment of a woven basket found in the Olympic subalpine of Obstruction Point was radiocarbon dated to nearly 3000 years ago.

The mountains were originally called &quot;Sun-a-do&quot; by the Duwamish Indians, while the first European to see them, the Spanish navigator Juan Pérez, named Mount Olympus &quot;Santa Rosalia&quot;, in 1774. But the English captain John Meares, seeing them in 1788, thought he would honor the Greek explorer Juan de Fuca who claimed to have found the fabled Northwest passage nearby by naming the mountain after the mythical home of Greek gods which is &quot;Mount Olympus&quot; in Greece. Various names for the mountains were used based on the name Mount Olympus, including the Olympic Range, the Olympian Mountains, and the Olympus Range. Alternate proposals never caught on, and in 1864 the Seattle &quot;Weekly Gazette&quot; persuaded the government to make the present-day name official, although other names continued to be used.

===First O&#x27;Neil Expedition, 1885===

Though readily visible from many parts of western Washington, especially Seattle, the interior was almost entirely unexplored until 1885, when 2nd Lt. Joseph P. O&#x27;Neil of the 14th Infantry, stationed at Fort Vancouver, led a small expedition into the northern Olympics from Port Angeles. O&#x27;Neil led an expedition of 3 enlisted men, 2 civilian engineers, and 8 mules out of Port Angeles in July 1885. The expedition cut a mule trail from Port Angeles up to Hurricane Ridge and camped near the current site of the national park visitor center. From there, they explored and built trail to the east and south, exploring the upper Dungeness and Dosewallips River watersheds, and to Cameron Basin near Mount Cameron. O&#x27;Neil was recalled by the Army in August to be transferred to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, and the expedition had to return to Fort Townsend. The Obstruction Peak Road and portions of the Hurricane Ridge Road and the Klahane Ridge, Grand Pass and Lost Pass trails in Olympic National Park originated with the mule trails built by this expedition.

In late 1889, Charles A. Gilman and his son Samuel explored the East Fork Quinault up to its headwaters, but chose to return the way they came rather than cross over the mountains.

===Press Expedition 1889–1890===
The first crossing of the Olympic Mountains was done from November 1889 through May 1890 by the Press Expedition, a group of 5 men led by Canadian James H. Christie, sponsored by the Seattle newspaper &quot;Press&quot;, which ascended the Elwha River and descended the North Fork Quinault River. The Press party included 2 mules, which both died in separate incidents, and 4 dogs, 1 of which was killed by an elk.

The Press Expedition crossed in winter, in order to beat O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s planned expedition for the summer of 1890. Initially the expedition built a boat on the Elwha to tow their cargo upriver, but the icy water and deep snow covering boulders and fallen trees made this mode of transportation very slow – after 2 weeks, the men had towed the boat . It did, however, carry cargo where the mules could not. Christie and his men abandoned the boat and switched to the mules when they reached the head of navigation on the Elwha, but the mules both died in separate incidents fairly early in the expedition. Deep snow, steep slopes, and fallen trees made travel extremely difficult for the mules, along with lack of forage.

The expedition carried minimal food, expecting to find game. In the lowlands, game and fish were plentiful, but the heavy snow that winter drove game out of the mountains and for long stretches in the high mountains, the men were reduced to eating &#x27;flour soup&#x27;. Unlike O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s military expeditions, the Press Expedition had no resupply line. Once into the high mountains and the deep snow, with no game, they went weeks with no meat and little to eat besides flour and beans. The men carried all the cargo on their own backs through one of the roughest and most labyrinthine sections of the high mountains, through snow deep.

On climbing a peak to get a view of the area, Christie estimated the snow at the peak to be deep. Avalanches occurred on a daily basis. Crossing Low Divide between the upper Elwha and the headwaters of the North Fork Quinault, the men climbed a vertical cliff, requiring Christie to climb to a ledge and then lower a rope to the men below. Packs, dogs, and men were hauled up the cliff by rope. Once on the Quinault side of the divide, the men shot and ate a bear, the first meat they had had for several weeks of strenuous winter mountain travel.

Deep snow prevented proper trail building for much of their route, although they did cut a rough trail along the lower reach of the Elwha River, and blazed trees along their route. They used elk trails wherever possible, and walked in the river when there was no other way through due to steep terrain or dense brush. It took the expedition four months of slogging through dense brush and windthrows, swamps, steep canyons and deep, wet, slushy snow just to reach the inner mountains. Once in the high mountains, the relief was so precipitous that the men estimated they traveled up and down as much as to cover horizontal miles.

Once on the mainstem Quinault River, the men built a raft, but it wrecked on a logjam. The men saved the dogs and the one pack that contained their maps, photographs, and records made along the route, but lost all their food, armaments, utensils, fishing tackle, shelter, and the few mineral and plant specimens and animal skins they had collected; and the men were split on opposite sides of the river, unable to reach each other. They continued walking down the river, eating salmonberry shoots and spruce bark, until a settler and a Quinault Indian guide canoeing to Lake Quinault rescued them. When the O&#x27;Neil expedition of 1890 reached the mainstem Quinault River a few months later, they found some of the items the Press Expedition had lost in the wreck. The settler and neighboring Indians took the expedition across Lake Quinault and down the lower river to the coast in mid May, nearly six months after they left Port Angeles. From the mouth of the Quinault they traveled to Aberdeen and then to Seattle. Their account of their expedition, along with photographs and a full-page map, was printed in a special edition of the &quot;Press&quot; on 16 July 1890.

The Elwha River and North Fork Quinault trails in Olympic National Park follow the route of the Press Expedition, with a detour through the highest mountains and around the vertical cliff at Low Divide.

===Second O&#x27;Neil Expedition, 1890===

O&#x27;Neil returned to Washington in 1887 and started planning another expedition. The Olympic Exploring Expedition, led by O&#x27;Neil, crossed the southern Olympics in the summer of 1890, ascending the North Fork Skokomish River and descending the East Fork Quinault River, building a mule trail the entire distance. This expedition was larger than the 1885 expedition, and would be resupplied by mule train from Hoodsport on Hood Canal, allowing time for scientific exploration of the area. The expedition consisted of 10 soldiers, 1 civilian mule packer, 4 civilian scientists from the Oregon Alpine Club, 11 mules, 1 bell mare to lead the mule train, and up to 4 dogs. The scientists collected specimens of plants, animals, and minerals, which they shipped back to Portland by way of the mule train to Hoodsport. The majority of the party was assigned to cutting the mule trail, while 2 or 3 man exploring parties fanned out and scouts went ahead. The scouts and side exploring parties scrambled up slopes on all fours, pulling themselves up by grabbing onto vegetation; descended similar slopes by sliding, deliberately or inadvertently; hacked and crawled through dense brush and windthrow; waded up rivers and streams when there was no other way through; felled trees to bridge ravines and rivers; and traversed narrow ridges of crumbling vertically oriented shale. Hornet and yellow jacket wasp attacks were a daily occurrence, sending men scrambling and mules stampeding, one over a cliff to her death. Where the men crossed swamps, devils club thorns impaled the men and broke off in their skin, creating painful inflammations.

Once camped in the central mountains, O&#x27;Neil sent out small exploring parties to the Duckabush, Dosewallips, South Fork Skokomish, Wynoochee and Humptulips rivers, and to Mount Olympus and the Queets River. One party of 3 men climbed what they thought was Mount Olympus but was in reality one of the neighboring peaks, Athena II. A fourth member of the summit party became separated on the climb and ended up descending the Queets River alone, and was taken in by a Quinault Indian family. They were reluctant to believe that he had crossed the Olympics, not believing it was possible to do so; but they accepted his story when he was able to point out reference points on a map. (Many members of this expedition spoke Chinook jargon.) From their settlement, he was able to rejoin the expedition in Hoquiam. O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s reports on his explorations resulted in his recommendation that the region be declared a national park.

===20th century===

Mount Olympus itself was not ascended until 1907, one of the first successes of The Mountaineers, which had been organized in Seattle just a few years earlier. A number of the more obscure and least-accessible peaks in the range were not ascended until the 1970s.

President Grover Cleveland protected the forests of the Olympic Peninsula with the Olympic Forest Reserve in 1897. Initially the reserve consisted of over , nearly the entire peninsula. Forest Service surveyors Dodwell and Rixon spent three years surveying, timber cruising, and mapping the new reserve. Their report, published in 1902, reported that most of the land was not suited to agriculture, but local politicians had already convinced President William McKinley to remove the most valuable lowland timber from the reserve, claiming it should be open to homesteading. Private timber companies paid &#x27;homesteaders&#x27; to file claims on land that they then sold to the timber company. At the same time, commercial hunters reduced the Olympic elk herds to fewer than 2000 animals, prompting the state legislature to impose a temporary moratorium on elk hunting in the Olympics. The Forest Reserve was reorganized under Gifford Pinchot as the Olympic National Forest in 1905, with an emphasis on commercial utilization of timber and minerals and fire protection, as well as hunting and trapping. With the passing of the Antiquities Act in 1906, which allowed the president to designate national monuments, Mount Olympus National Monument, administered by the Forest Service, was proclaimed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1909 in order to protect the elk herds. In 1914, the new supervisor of the Forest Service, Henry Graves, made a trip to the Olympics to determine if commercial timber and minerals were being tied up in the national monument. As a result of Graves&#x27;s report, President Woodrow Wilson removed a third of a from the monument.

The Elwha River was dammed in 1910 with construction of the Elwha Dam. A second dam was built a few miles upstream in 1927. Neither dam had any fish passage for the salmonid runs, eliminating salmonids from over of river. Congress authorized removal of these dams in 1992, and work began in 2011.

The North Fork Skokomish River was dammed in the 1920s by the city of Tacoma, enlarging the original Lake Cushman by 600%. A settlement was reached in 2009 with the Skokomish Indian Tribe over damages to fisheries and game habitat, damages to tribal lands through flooding, and trespass on tribal lands for the power transmission line. As part of the settlement, migrating salmon will be trucked around the dam.

The Wynoochee River was dammed in the late 1960s by the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, but in 1994 the dam was taken over by the city of Tacoma for power generation. Migrating salmon are trucked around the dam, and Tacoma Public Utilities funds mitigation for Roosevelt elk wintering habitat that was lost under the reservoir.

With the building of the Spruce Railroad during World War I and the completion of the Olympic Highway in 1931, logging in the Olympics intensified, along with demand for recreational facilities. During this period the Forest Service built roads and campgrounds and encouraged private businesses with special use permits to build tourist facilities such as a winter sports facility at Deer Park and the chalets in Enchanted Valley and at Low Divide. Special use permits were also issued for private summer cabins at Lakes Cushman and Quinault, and the Olympic Hot Springs resort. During the Great Depression, the Olympic National Forest used the Civilian Conservation Corps to build logging roads and railroads, bridges, campgrounds, shelters, fire lookouts, ranger stations, and a fish hatchery. They also fought fires and planted tree seedlings.

Pressure for a national park built with the acceleration of logging and road building. The Forest Service campaigned in peninsula logging and mill towns against the national park, and both the Forest Service and the Park Service jockeyed for public support and endorsement from various conservation groups for administration of the monument. In 1935, a special committee was convened on the national park proposal. The majority reported that the Olympics fully rated protection as a national park, but one member issued a minority report stating that public pressure for recreational facilities would require the Park Service to build roads, campgrounds, and chalets, thus negating any benefit from national park status. Both the Forest Service and the Park Service sponsored backcountry trips through the high Olympics that summer to promote their stewardship of the mountains.

In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the Olympics to determine their suitability as a national park, and was greeted in Port Angeles by more than 3000 local school children asking him to &#x27;give us our Olympic National Park&#x27;. He signed Olympic National Park into law in 1938. In 1953, the park was enlarged with the addition of the coastal strip, and more coastal areas along Lake Ozette were added in 1976. Also that year, UNESCO named the park an International Biosphere Reserve, and a World Heritage Site in 1981. In 1984, Congress designated 5 wilderness areas in the Olympic National Forest, and declared 95% of Olympic National Park a wilderness area in 1988.

<text>Christian hip-hop (originally gospel rap, also known as Christian rap, gospel hip-hop or holy hip-hop) is a cross-genre of contemporary Christian music and hip-hop. It emerged from urban contemporary music and Christian media in the United States during the 1980s.

Christian hip-hop music first emerged on record in 1982 with a track entitled &quot;Jesus Christ (The Gospel Beat)&quot; by Queens, New York artist McSweet. The first full-length Christian hip-hop album, &quot;Bible Break&quot;, by Oklahoma artist Stephen Wiley, was released in 1985, with the title track becoming a hit on Christian radio in 1986. Other early Christian hip recording artists from the mid-1980s included P.I.D. (Preachas in Disguise), who recorded to funky rock rhythms, as well as JC &amp; the Boys and Michael Peace. During the 1990s and 2000s, rapper KJ-52 rose to prominence in the field.

Christian rock band DC Talk blended hip-hop and rock, and were successful in mainstream Christian music. All three band members have had successful independent careers, Michael Tait and Kevin Max Smith in Christian pop, and TobyMac as a Christian rapper and label owner. Along with Lecrae, NF, KB &amp; Emcee N.I.C.E. who have emerged recently on the mainstream rap scene along with American popular music figures DMX, Snoop Dogg, and Kanye West. Outside of the United States, there are Christian rap scenes in the UK, Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. Asian, Black, and Latino rappers are becoming a major part of the genre, and this success is expanding the appeal of both Christian hip-hop and Christian EDM within general hip-hop and broader popular music.

== History and notable examples ==
The first commercially released and distributed gospel hip-hop record was MC Pete Harrison of Queens, New York. Under the recording name McSweet, he released &quot;The Gospel Beat: Jesus-Christ&quot; (1982), written and arranged by Harrison and produced by Mac Sulliver on Lection Records of PolyGram. The first notable full album released was Stephen Wiley&#x27;s &quot;Bible Break&quot; (1985), written by Wiley and produced by Mike Barnes on Brentwood Records. In the same year, David Guzman founded JC &amp; The Boyz. Some of America&#x27;s premiere Christian rappers, such as: Michael Peace (one of Christian rap&#x27;s first solo artists), SFC, Dynamic Twins, MC Peace and T-Bone came out of this crew. A more commercially successful group known as P.I.D. (Preachers in Disguise) released five recordings.

Jon Gibson (or J.G.) is also considered a pioneer of Christian pop rap, with his first rap solo being &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Pretty&quot; (1985). CCM&#x27;s first rap hit by a blue-eyed soul singer and/or duo, &quot;The Wall&quot; was later released on Gibson&#x27;s successful album &quot;Change of Heart&quot; (1988), and featured MC Hammer (previously as the Holy Ghost Boys). Other tracks included the hit &quot;Love Come Down&quot; and &quot;In Too Deep&quot; from &quot;Jesus Loves Ya&quot; (1990). Gibson also collaborated with MC Peace on &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; (1990), &quot;Happy to Know Jesus&quot; (1992) and &quot;You Are the One&quot; (1992).

Other rap groups emerged in the late 1980s, including dc Talk, E.T.W. (End Time Warriors) and S.F.C. (Soldiers for Christ). ETW was led by producer/artist Mike Hill who went on to pastor one of the largest inner city youth groups in the country out of Tulsa Oklahoma. S.F.C. was led by Chris Cooper who originally rapped as Super C (short for Super Chris / Super Christian) and later became Sup the Chemist and then finally Soup the Chemist. Christian emcee Danny &quot;D-Boy&quot; Rodriguez was another well-known early Gospel rap artist, but was murdered in 1990 in Texas. Prior to his death, he helped launch the career of his sister, Genie Rodriguez-Lopez, known as MC GeGee – one of the first female Christian rap artists, by collaborating on her first album &quot;I&#x27;m for Real&quot;. She would go on to release a second album in 1991, titled &quot;And Now the Mission Continues&quot;.

The trend of rap artists blending faith and rap continued in the 1990s, with D.O.C. (Disciples of Christ) who emerged from Oklahoma as well as the Gospel Gangstaz from Compton and South Central Los Angeles. In 1991, JC Crew emerged featuring Maximillian (West Coast beat box champion) and T-Bone.

More Christian rap artists include Dynamic Twins, Freedom of Soul, IDOL King, Apocalypse, 12th Tribe, and Holy Alliance. 12th Tribe and Holy Alliance were produced by Scott Blackwell of MYX Records. S.F.C.&#x27;s (Sup, QP, DJ Dove) 1992 album &quot;Phase III&quot; was DJed and produced by DJ Dove, whose credits also include the &quot;Gang Affiliated&quot;, Gospel Gangstas&#x27; 1993 debut album. Around the same time as &quot;Phase III&quot;, Dynamic Twins (Robbie and Noel) came out with their 1993 album &quot;No Room To Breathe&quot;. Freedom of Soul (MC Peace, DJ Cartoon) followed with their second album, &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (&quot;Caught in a Land of Time&quot; was their first), also their last album as a group.

Grapetree Records was the first Christian rap label founded by Knolly Williams and Jeff Adams 1994.

Gotee Records formed in 1994, co-founded by dc Talk member Toby McKeehan, better known as TobyMac, making it the first record label marketed explicitly for Christian hip-hop and R&amp;B that was backed by a major label. The label was among the first to market the Contemporary Christian music market through distribution at Christian bookstores and playing on Christian radio.

In 2004, the founding of the label Reach Records by the Americans Lecrae and Ben Washer also had a considerable influence in the development of Christian hip-hop. In 2015, the label have been setting records with sales and award-winning albums.

In 2019, Kanye West, a popular artist and producer, released his ninth studio album, Jesus Is King (shortened as JIK). JIK was described as an &quot;expression of the Gospel&quot; by West himself.

== Influence and style of artists ==
Although generally described to be Christian rappers, artists such as Lecrae, Andy Mineo, KB, Trip Lee, Tedashii, Social Club Misfits, NF, John Givez, Derek Minor and Propaganda describe themselves as hip-hop artists who are expressing themselves, yet are openly Christian. Just like in Christian rock and other Christian music genres, some artists welcome being called Christian artists while others do not want to be labeled as &quot;Christian music&quot;, as to not limit their music to the Christian music market.

The record label Ministers of the Underground was one of the few labels to showcase underground hip-hop with the group, Secta 7. Members included: Apocalypse, Optixs, Blackseed, Lord Metatron, Righteous Knight, Kaoticgal (who later was known as Keturah Ariel), O.N.E., The Final Chapter, A.T.O.M. the Immortal and Stress. Ministers of the Underground had a small-time show on Christian television, but was taken off the networks when Christian television opted for more orthodox style programming. The Ministers of Underground hosted events at a series of venues under the name CRU VENTION, or the convention of Underground Hip-hop for Christ, until around the year 2001.

A few Christian rappers have emerged from Atlanta, including Remnant Militia and D.I.R.T. While many notable studios and artists share influence in holy hip-hop, not one style dominates. Christian hip-hop features all conventional hip-hop styles, such as Midwest (Hostyle Gospel), West Coast (T-Bone), East Coast (BB Jay), Dirty South (Pettidee) and King Wes. Some, such as DC Talk, include a mixture of hip-hop, rock and gospel music in their songs.

Christian hip-hop is also embraced and performed in the United Kingdom, by Gospel rappers including: Jahaziel, Dwayne Tryumf, Guvna B, Triple O, Sammy G, Simply Andy, MpFree and Just C.

In the UK, Christian hip-hop is often merged with a music style known as grime, which gives the music a different sound from American hip-hop. Many agree that grime music originated in London&#x27;s black community and is predominantly described as a secular genre. Although British, grime music has a strong Jamaican influence as many of the artists are of British-Caribbean heritage. The GL Live music event 2010, held in the United Kingdom, included a fusion of Christian rappers (both American and British) celebrate their faith together whilst demonstrating their own unique styles. The event was attended by Trip Lee and Tedashii, who performed several songs during the event including &quot;Jesus Muzik&quot; and &quot;No Worries&quot;.

== Reaction and acceptance ==
=== Industry ===
Christian music awards shows such as the GMA Dove Awards and Stellar Awards have added rap and hip-hop categories. With the notable exceptions of tobyMac and his label Gotee Records, and Lecrae, no Christian rapper or hip-hop group has garnered the attention of the mainstream Christian music industry. The nominal sales of Christian rap labels have been almost exclusively to church-going Christians. Christian rap exists almost exclusively underground.

=== Markets ===
There is no identifiable Christian hip-hop market, as the majority of Christian hip-hop has been underground, or marketed towards the mainstream Christian music scene.

In Australia, a multi-denominational group of Christian hip-hop artists, led by Mistery from Brethren, have started a hip-hop church, Krosswerdz. The church has been modeled on Crossover Church in Tampa, Florida.

A small Christian hip-hop scene has also emerged in the UK.

=== Festivals ===


Rap Fest is an all-day, outdoor, evangelistic outreach concert which takes place every summer. 2011 marked the 18th year for this event held annually in South Bronx area of New York City.

Flavor Fest Urban Leadership Conference is held yearly at Crossover Church in Tampa, Florida, founded by Pastor Tommy Kyllonen, lead pastor of Crossover Church of Tampa.

Fire Fest International Ministries was founded by Charles Onley (a.k.a. King C) in conjunction with Terence A. Townsend, &quot;Apostle T&quot;, founder of Save Our City Crusades and Conferences (SoCity) to reach the international community of holy hip-hop with a message of encouragement, enrichment, education and unity. Fire Fest conducts artist retreats, artists/industry conferences and new artists showcases, and is a traveling music festival organized to encourage and enrich holy hip-hop artists in their ministries, while giving them insight on navigating the music industry.

&quot;God&#x27;s House of Hip Hop 20/20 Summer Fest&quot; featuring 75 Christian hip-hop, Latin Christian hip-hop &amp; Gospel hip-hop music. in Los Angeles, California Founded by Emcee N.I.C.E. and Chantal Grayson of God&#x27;s House of Hip Hop Radio. Although postponed to July 2021 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, 20/20 Summer Fest gained national attention securing one of Los Angeles&#x27;s most premium venue&#x27;s Banc of California Stadium.

=== Crossover ===
Holy hip-hop has enjoyed some crossover acceptance as well. One of the early accepted artists were Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.).

One of the most notable mainstream reactions to Gospel rap was to KJ-52 (pronounced &quot;five-two&quot;) and his single &quot;Dear Slim&quot;, which was written to Eminem in an attempt to reach him with the message of Christ. The song became famous and controversial among Eminem fans when it was featured on the hit show &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. began to receive hate mail (including death threats) from Eminem&#x27;s fans, though claimed that the song was not a &quot;diss&quot;. This also led to the single being disparaged by VH1 as No. 26 on their &quot;Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop&quot;, an issue the artist addressed in &quot;Washed Up&quot;. In contrast, the GRITS song &quot;Ooh Ahh&quot; received positive exposure on various TV Shows and movies, such as &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; and &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House 2&quot;. It was also featured as the theme song for the second season of MTV&#x27;s hit show &quot;The Buried Life&quot;.

Christian symbols and themes have also been invoked by rap artists who do not consider themselves &quot;Christian rappers&quot;, and do not claim to represent any particular set of religious beliefs. Examples include MC Hammer&#x27;s No. 2 single &quot;Pray&quot;; Richie Rich and his first single &quot;Don&#x27;t Do It&quot;; and many of Tupac&#x27;s lyrics with his first posthumous record &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot;, including the blasphemous image of Tupac nailed to a cross pinned him as a hip-hop martyr. Recent hip-hop artists include Jay-Z with &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, DMX with &quot;Walk With Me Now and You&#x27;ll Fly With Me Later&quot;, Nas with &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; and Kanye West with &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; as well as &quot;Jesus Is King&quot;. However, although these artists may profess to be Christians, they are not generally considered to be part of the Christian hip-hop movement. Some Christians believe that hip-hop culture in any form conflicts with biblical teachings, while others consider hip-hop to be a way of reaching the youth and mainstream culture.

=== Mainstream and radio ===
In 2003 DJ/Producer Vic Padilla shared his love for Christian hip-hop with then KRUX FM Program Director Lee- and was subsequently asked to host a show he dubbed Holy Culture Radio. Fans would have to stay up to odd hours to listen, as the show was only broadcast live. Vic then partnered up with JZ Designs to bring HolyCultureRadio.com to life- bringing fans 24/7 access to Christian hip-hop.

In 2008, Holy Culture Radio partnered with The Corelink Solution, and James Rosseau (Trig), and a year later launched HolyCulture.net; a place where listeners could get the latest news, videos, and interviews from their favorite Christian artists.

Artists like Lecrae, who released his album &quot;Anomaly&quot; on September 9, 2014, through Reach Records. The album achieved mainstream success as it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of over 88,000 copies in the United States. On October 6, 2017, Christian hip-hop artist NF released his third studio album &quot;Perception&quot;, through Capitol CMG alongside NF&#x27;s newly launched label NF Real Music LLC. &quot;Perception&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 55,000 album-equivalent units, including 38,000 pure album sales.

In 2018, the Holy Culture Mobile App was launched- the first app solely streaming Christian hip-hop and R&amp;P (rhythm and praise) around the clock.

In 2019, Christian hip-hop had a historic breakthrough in radio, when Los Angeles based radio station God&#x27;s House of Hip Hop Radio (powered by Dash Radio and curated by CHH artist Emcee N.I.C.E.), became the first Christian hip-hop station in history to win a Stellar Award (one of gospel music&#x27;s most coveted trophies) at the 34th Annual Stellar Awards. The win signaled a shift not only in gospel but radio as a whole, with more artists outside of Lecrae such as Andy Mineo, Gawvi, Wande, Shepherd, 1K Phew, Swoope, Bizzle, Derek Minor and others receiving commercial notoriety in film, television and gaming.

The Stellar Awards did something unprecedented at its radio awards main show when it opened up with hip-hop and featured performances with DJ Dwight Stone who won &quot;Gospel Announcer of the Year&quot;, Miz Tiffany (first CHH female nominated for a Stellar Award), Emcee N.I.C.E. &amp; Jor&#x27;Dan Armstrong.

In April 2022, with the increased demand for Christian hip-hop and rhythm &amp; praise, Sirius XM announced the launch of Holy Culture Radio (www.holyculture.net/radio), where audiences could listen throughout the day to faith-inspired music and enjoy any of the fourteen shows within the channel. To date, Holy Culture is a go-to destination for all things Christian hip-hop.

=== Acceptance and themes ===
Various prominent mainstream hip-hop artists who profess through some of their music to be Christians (including Kanye West, Nas, DMX and others), have incorporated Christian symbols and messages into their music and videos through images, lyrical content and overarching themes. The 2002 Nas hit song and music video &quot;One Mic&quot;, featured obvious references to his Christianity in the song, including the chorus &quot;Yo all I need is... One God to show me how to do things his Son did...&quot; Kanye West&#x27;s 2004 hit song and music video &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, has received a notable amount of attention for its Christian content. DMX incorporated prayers in many of his albums, and his 2006 song and music video &quot;Lord Give Me a Sign&quot;, was highlighted by not only strong Christian lyrical content but actual scriptural quotes (&quot;no weapon formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that rises up against me in judgment, Thou shall condemn&quot;) from the Holy Bible. Prominent Christian rapper Lecrae, whose 2014 album &quot;Anomaly&quot; reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received numerous other accolades, expresses an explicitly Christian message in the majority of his music. However, while generally categorized as a gospel or Christian rapper, he distances himself from the genre of gospel rap saying, &quot;Christian is my faith not my genre&quot;.

The use of religious themes in music that is otherwise regarded as illicit has sparked controversy over the validity of the religious messages expressed through the music. Some Christian listeners hold that &quot;rap music, because of what it inherently communicates, is incompatible with the Christian Gospel&quot;, and attack the use of Christian themes and symbols in mainstream music as being disingenuous. On the other hand, &quot;since the mid-1990s Michael Eric Dyson and others have pointed to some cultural sensibilities shared by Christian churches and hip-hop music; namely male privilege, middle-class biases, sexism, and homophobia.&quot; Some analysts believe that the suffering expressed through rap music manifests itself in a certain spirituality that can be compatible with mainstream religious messages, although it approaches religious ideas in a much less direct way than most forms of religious expression. &quot;Just as the MC slides into notes and dances around beats, &quot;spirit&quot; is not attacked straight on; it is courageously approached from below, from the margins, from youth, from uncertainty, through the structures of capitalism and mainstream media.&quot; Some think that the use of mainstream religious symbols in predominantly African-American music has increased the extent to which that music has disseminated through predominantly white American culture.

The 2007 Holy Hip Hop Music Awards received a written endorsement letter from the mayor of Atlanta, acknowledging the event&#x27;s support by the City of Atlanta, and recognizing its 7th year. However, EX Ministries and other churches contested the incorporation of secular hip-hop culture into the Christian rap genre, holding that &quot;Holy hip-hop&quot; is still associated with the mainstream hip-hop culture that they view as incompatible with Christianity&#x27;s teachings. Whereas many Christians hold that holy hip-hop can be used to evangelize, others disagree, arguing that the use of this style distorts the gospel message.

From December 2013 well into 2014, Scott Aniol and Christian hip-hop artist Shai Linne had a lengthy exchange about Christian rap (rap being the core element of hip-hop), with Dr. Aniol arguing that the style is sinful and inadequate for Christian messages, with Shai Linne responding that the musical messaging of hip-hop is relative, being interpreted differently by people from different backgrounds.

== Forms and subgenres ==
=== Catholic hip-hop ===
In the early 2000s, rap artists of the Roman Catholic faith began emerging. Today, a number of active Catholic rappers and DJs are involved in what is known as the &quot;Catholic hip-hop scene&quot;. Fr. Stan Fortuna is the most notable in the scene found nation continue doing the Catholic hip-hop.

=== Lutheran hip-hop ===
Lutheran hip-hop artists include Andy Pokel, who in 2017 launched the &quot;Here I Stand&quot; album based on the events of Reformation Day, as well as Flame, whose album &quot;Christ for You&quot;, focuses on Lutheran doctrines such as the sacramental union, the Lutheran teaching on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Flame named his album &quot;Christ for You&quot; as he wants his fans &quot;to experience the joy and freedom that I&#x27;ve found in the sacraments.&quot; His track &quot;Scattered Tulips&quot; is a critique of Reformed Christianity&#x27;s five points (TULIP). The release of &quot;Christ for You&quot; led the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod to declare that &quot;Lutheran hip-hop is a thing now!&quot; The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has commissioned two rap videos—&quot;Kaunis Jeesus&quot; and &quot;Hoosianna&quot;.

=== Latin Christian hip-hop ===

Latin hip-hop is a subgenre of Latin music and Christian hip-hop, taking influence from Latin rap as well as in Puerto Rican music. Some notable names include Redimi2, Funky, and Alex Zurdo.

=== Gospel rap in Brazil ===
In Brazil, gospel rap comes out of Pentecostal and Charismatic Evangelical Protestant movements, and emphasizes the message of the Gospel and salvation through faith over black politics and identity. Gospel rappers view their music as divinely ordained, and believe their lyrics are a manifestation of the Holy Spirit speaking through them. The Brazilian gospel rap movement sees itself as divinely favored over the fallen state of rap in the US and other parts of the world, and sees its origins in the Bronx which they see as similar to their own tough neighborhoods. This reflects the gospel rap movement&#x27;s emphasis on neighborhood and seeking God and opportunities for their neighborhoods.

<doc id="215896" wikidata="Q966564" url="?curid=215896" title="Hardcore hip-hop">
<text>Hardcore hip hop (also hardcore rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that developed through the East Coast hip hop scene in the 1980s. Pioneered by such artists as Run-DMC, Schoolly D, Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy, it is generally characterized by anger, aggression and confrontation.

==History==
Music experts have credited Run-DMC as the first hardcore hip hop group. Other early artists to adopt an aggressive style were Schoolly D in Philadelphia and Too $hort in Oakland. Before a formula for gangsta rap had developed, artists such as Boogie Down Productions and Ice-T wrote lyrics based on detailed observations of &quot;street life&quot;, while the confrontational and aggressive lyrics and chaotic, rough production style of Public Enemy&#x27;s records set new standards for hardcore hip hop and hip hop production. Though initially a largely East Coast phenomenon, by the late 1980s, hardcore rap increasingly became largely synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap, with artists like N.W.A infusing &quot;gangsta&quot; themed stories of gritty gang life.

In the early 1990s, hardcore hip hop again became associated with the East Coast as Wu-Tang Clan emerged with minimalistic beats and piano-driven sampling, which became widely popular among other hardcore hip hop artists of the time. In the early, late 90s and early 2000s, other New York based artists like Onyx, DMX and M.O.P. incorporated yelling in their lyrics. In the 2010s, punk rap combined elements of hardcore hip hop and hardcore punk, with artists like Denzel Curry at the forefront.

==Characteristics==
Gangsta rap has often been associated with the hardcore hip hop style, and gangsta rap is generally considered a subgenre or offshoot of hardcore hip hop. However, not all hardcore hip hop revolves around &quot;gangsta&quot; lyrical themes, despite the considerable overlap between the two genres, especially within hardcore rappers of the 1990s. Hardcore hip hop is characterised by aggression and confrontation and generally describes violence or anger. Russell Potter wrote that while hardcore rap has been associated with a &quot;monolithic &#x27;gangsta&#x27; outlook&quot; by the popular press, hardcore rappers have &quot;laid claim to a wide variety of ground&quot;.

<doc id="215899" wikidata="Q7545395" url="?curid=215899" title="Smith set">
<text>The Smith set, sometimes called the top-cycle or Condorcet winning set, generalizes the idea of a Condorcet winner to cases where no such winner exists. It does so by allowing cycles of candidates to be treated jointly, as if they were a single Condorcet winner. Voting systems that always elect a candidate from the Smith set pass the Smith criterion. The Smith set and Smith criterion are both named for mathematician John H. Smith. 

The Smith set provides one standard of optimal choice for an election outcome. An alternative, stricter criterion is given by the Landau set.

== Definition ==
The Smith set is formally defined as the smallest set such that every candidate inside the set &quot;S&quot; is pairwise unbeaten by every candidate outside &quot;S&quot;.

Alternatively, it can be defined as the set of all candidates with a (non-strict) beatpath to any candidate who defeats them.

A set of candidates each of whose members pairwise defeats every candidate outside the set is known as a &quot;dominating set&quot;. Thus the Smith set is also called the smallest dominating set.

=== Strict top-cycle (Schwartz set) ===
The Schwartz set is equivalent to the Smith set, except it ignores tied votes. Formally, the Schwartz set is the set such that any candidate inside the set has a &quot;strict&quot; beatpath to any candidate who defeats them.

The Smith set can be constructed from the Schwartz set by repeatedly adding two types of candidates until no more such candidates exist outside the set:

* candidates that are pairwise-tied with candidates in the set,
* candidates that defeat a candidate in the set.

Note that candidates of the second type can only exist after candidates of the first type have been added.

==Properties==

* The Smith set always exists and is non-empty. It is also well-defined (see next section).
* The Smith set can have more than one candidate, either because of pairwise ties or because of cycles, such as in Condorcet&#x27;s paradox.
* The Condorcet winner, if one exists, is the sole member of the Smith set. If weak Condorcet winners exist they are in the Smith set.
* The Smith set is always a subset of the smallest mutual majority-preferred set of candidates.

===Properties of dominating sets===
Theorem: Dominating sets are &quot;nested&quot;; that is, of any two dominating sets in an election, one is a subset of the other.

Proof: Suppose on the contrary that there exist two dominating sets, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, neither of which is a subset of the other. Then there must exist candidates such that and But by hypothesis &quot;d&quot; defeats every candidate not in &quot;D&quot; (including &quot;e&quot;) while &quot;e&quot; defeats every candidate not in &quot;E&quot; (including &quot;d&quot;), a contradiction. ∎

Corollary: It follows that the Smith set is the smallest non-empty dominating set, and that it is well defined.

Theorem: If &quot;D&quot; is a dominating set, then there is some threshold θ&quot;D&quot; such that the elements of &quot;D&quot; are precisely the candidates whose Copeland scores are at least θ&quot;D&quot;. (A candidate&#x27;s Copeland score is the number of other candidates whom he or she defeats plus half the number of other candidates with whom he or she is tied.)

Proof: Choose &quot;d&quot; as an element of &quot;D&quot; with minimum Copeland score, and identify this score with θ&quot;D&quot;. Now suppose that some candidate has a Copeland score not less than θ&quot;D&quot;. Then since &quot;d&quot; belongs to &quot;D&quot; and &quot;e&quot; doesn&#x27;t, it follows that &quot;d&quot; defeats &quot;e&quot;; and in order for &quot;e&quot;″s Copeland score to be at least equal to &quot;d&quot;″s, there must be some third candidate &quot;f&quot; against whom &quot;e&quot; gets a better score than does &quot;d&quot;. If then we have an element of &quot;D&quot; who does not defeat &quot;e&quot;, and if then we have a candidate outside of &quot;D&quot; whom &quot;d&quot; does not defeat, leading to a contradiction either way. ∎

==The Smith criterion==
The Smith criterion is a voting system criterion that formalizes a stronger idea of majority rule than the Condorcet criterion. A voting system satisfies the Smith criterion if it always picks a candidate from the Smith set.

Though less common, the term &quot;Smith-efficient&quot; has also been used for methods that elect from the Smith set.

Here is an example of an electorate in which there is no Condorcet winner: There are four candidates: A, B, C and D. 40% of the voters rank D&gt;A&gt;B&gt;C. 35% of the voters rank B&gt;C&gt;A&gt;D. 25% of the voters rank C&gt;A&gt;B&gt;D. The Smith set is {A,B,C}. All three candidates in the Smith set are majority-preferred over D (since 60% rank each of them over D). The Smith set is not {A,B,C,D} because the definition calls for the &quot;smallest&quot; subset that meets the other conditions. The Smith set is not {B,C} because B is not majority-preferred over A; 65% rank A over B. (Etc.)

In this example, under minimax, A and D tie; under Smith//Minimax, A wins.

In the example above, the three candidates in the Smith set are in a &quot;rock/paper/scissors&quot; &quot;majority cycle&quot;: A is ranked over B by a 65% majority, B is ranked over C by a 75% majority, and C is ranked over A by a 60% majority.

=== Other criteria ===
Any election method that complies with the Smith criterion also complies with the Condorcet winner criterion, since if there is a Condorcet winner, then it is the only candidate in the Smith set. Smith methods also comply with the Condorcet loser criterion, because a Condorcet loser will never fall in the Smith set. It also implies the mutual majority criterion, since the Smith set is a subset of the MMC set. Conversely, any method that fails any of those three majoritarian criteria (Mutual majority, Condorcet loser or Condorcet winner) will also fail the Smith criterion.

=== Complying methods ===
The Smith criterion is satisfied by ranked pairs, Schulze&#x27;s method, Nanson&#x27;s method, and several other methods. Moreover, any voting method can be modified to satisfy the Smith criterion, by finding the Smith set and eliminating any candidates outside of it. 

For example, the voting method Smith//Minimax applies Minimax to the candidates in the Smith set. Another example is the Tideman alternative method, which alternates between eliminating candidates outside of the Smith set, and eliminating the candidate who was the plurality loser (similar to instant-runoff), until a Condorcet winner is found. A different approach is to elect the member of the Smith set that is highest in the voting method&#x27;s order of finish. 

Methods failing the Condorcet criterion also fail the Smith criterion. However, some Condorcet methods (such as Minimax) can fail the Smith criterion.

==Relation to other tournament sets==

The Smith set contains the Copeland set and Landau set as subsets.

It also contains the Banks set and the Bipartisan set. A number of other subsets of the Smith set have been defined as well.

==Computing the Smith set==
The Smith set can be calculated with the Floyd–Warshall algorithm in time Θ(&quot;n&quot;3) or Kosaraju&#x27;s algorithm in time Θ(&quot;n&quot;2).

=== Detailed algorithm ===
The algorithm can be presented in detail through an example. Suppose that the results matrix is as follows:

Here an entry in the main table is 1 if the first candidate was preferred to the second by more voters than preferred the second to the first; 0 if the opposite relation holds; and if there is a tie. The final column gives the Copeland score of the first candidate.

The algorithm to compute the Smith set is agglomerative: it starts with the Copeland set, which is guaranteed to be a subset of it but will often be smaller, and adds items until no more are needed. The first step is to sort the candidates according to score:

We look at the highest score (5) and consider the candidates (Copeland winners) whose score is at least this high, i.e. {A,D}. These certainly belong to the Smith set, and any candidates whom they do not defeat will need to be added. To find undefeated candidates we look at the cells in the table below the top-left 2×2 square containing {A,D} (this square is shown with a broken border): the cells in question are shaded yellow in the table. We need to find the lowest (positionally) non-zero entry among these cells, which is the cell in the G row. All candidates as far down as this row, and any lower rows with the same score, need to be added to the set, which expands to {A,D,G}.

Now we look at any new cells which need to be considered, which are those below the top-left square containing {A,D,G}, but excluding those in the first two columns which we have already accounted for. The cells which need attention are shaded pale blue. As before we locate the positionally lowest non-zero entry among the new cells, adding all rows down to it, and all rows with the same score as it, to the expanded set, which now comprises {A,D,G,C}.

We repeat the operation for the new cells below the four members which are known to belong to the Smith set. These are shaded pink, and allow us to find any candidates not defeated by any of {A,D,G,C}. Again there is just one, F, whom we add to the set.

The cells which come into consideration are shaded pale green, and since all their entries are zero we do not need to add any new candidates to the set, which is therefore fixed as {A,D,G,C,F}. And by noticing that all the entries in the black box are zero, we have confirmation that all the candidates above it defeat all the candidates within it.

The following C function illustrates the algorithm by returning the cardinality of the Smith set for a given doubled results matrix &quot;r&quot; and array &quot;s&quot; of doubled Copeland scores. There are &quot;n&quot; candidates; &quot;ri j&quot; is 2 if more voters prefer &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; than prefer &quot;j&quot; to &quot;i&quot;, 1 if the numbers are equal, and 0 if more voters prefer &quot;j&quot; to &quot;i&quot; than prefer &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; ; &quot;si&quot; is the sum over &quot;j&quot; of the &quot;ri j &quot;. The candidates are assumed to be sorted in decreasing order of Copeland score.
int smithset(int ** r, int * s, int n) {
 int row, col, lhs, rhs;
 for (rhs = 1, lhs = 0; lhs &lt; rhs; lhs = rhs, rhs = row + 1) {
 for (; rhs &lt; n &amp;&amp; s[rhs] == s[rhs - 1]; rhs++); /* this line optional */
 for (col = rhs, row = n; col == rhs &amp;&amp; row &gt;= rhs; row--)
 for (col = lhs; col &lt; rhs &amp;&amp; r[row - 1][col] == 0; col++);
 return lhs;

<text>Donald J. Carty, (born July 23, 1946) is a Canadian-American businessman who is chair of Porter Airlines. Carty also is a director of VMWare, Hawaiian Airlines and Betterez. He was previously chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, from 1998 to 2003. He is the past Chairman of Virgin America and E-Rewards, Inc. (now known as Dynata). Carty is also a past director of Dell, CN Rail, Sears, Placer Dome, Barrick Gold, CHC Helicopters, Brinker International, Talisman Energy, EMC Corporation (now known as Dell EMC), and Gluskin Sheff. In January 2007, Carty became the vice chairman and chief financial officer of Dell. On June 13, 2008, Carty retired from day-to-day operations, but stayed on as a director. He is a past chairman of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a former member of the board of trustees of both Southern Methodist University and Queen&#x27;s University and of the board of directors of the Dallas Center for the Performing Arts Foundation and the Dallas Theater Center. He is on the executive board of the SMU Cox School of Business.

== Biography ==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, on July 23, 1946, Carty attended Queen&#x27;s University and Harvard Business School. He took US citizenship in the early 1980s. He worked for Air Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway before joining American, although he was CEO for CP Air from 1985 to 1987. At American, he was controller, and later executive vice president for finance and planning under CEO Robert Crandall, before becoming CEO of AMR himself in 1998.

In April 2003, in the long wake of the September 11 attacks and facing an industry beset by terrorism and hard economic times, Carty and his executive board wanted to strike a cost-cutting deal with American&#x27;s labor unions, intended to mitigate AMR&#x27;s upcoming $1 billion first-quarter loss. The deal—which was at the time the largest corporate restructuring outside of bankruptcy in American history—almost unraveled several days later, when unions learned that at the same time that American Airlines was demanding $1.6 billion in concessions from its unionized employees, the company gave $40 million in perks to its top executives, Although many other airlines had similar retention bonus arrangements, to facilitate a final agreement between the company and the unions, Carty voluntarily stepped down. He was replaced as CEO by Gerard Arpey, and as chairman by Edward A. Brennan.

Carty was appointed as Chairman of Virgin America on February 6, 2006. On February 2 of that year, Toronto-based Porter Airlines, in the process of starting up a regional service out of the downtown Toronto island airport, announced that Carty would simultaneously be its chairman. Carty has been on Hawaiian Airlines&#x27; board of directors three times; 2004–2007, 2008–2011, and since 2016.

In January 2007, Carty became the vice chairman and CFO of Dell Inc., replacing James Schneider. On May 19, 2008, Dell announced that Carty would step down on June 13, to be succeeded by longtime General Electric executive Brian Gladden, chief executive of SABIC Innovative Plastics, formerly GE Plastics. Carty remained as a director and vice chairman of Dell.

In 1999, Board Alert named him one of the year&#x27;s Outstanding Directors. In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In September 2002, Carty was appointed by President Bush to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council where he was until the summer of 2005. He is a recipient of an Honorary Doctor of Law from Queen&#x27;s University.

== Family life ==
Carty was in born in Toronto, growing up in Toronto and Montreal, with 4 brothers and a sister. In 1969, he met Sharon Louise Smith in Boston while at Harvard, and they married in 1970. They had three children while living in Montreal, Michael Patrick, Catherine Rebecca, and William Robert Douglas. Don and Sharon were divorced in 1994.

He was remarried in 1998 in Dallas to Eva Ana Maria Rodriguez. They have two children, Michael Malin Payne and Donald John Jr. They currently live in Dallas, Texas, and spend time in Newport Beach, California, and on a lake in Greater Madawaska, Ontario.

<doc id="215902" wikidata="Q937091" url="?curid=215902" title="Robert Hue">
<text>Robert Hue (; born 19 October 1946) is a French politician who was National Secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 1994 to 2001 and President of the PCF from 2001 to 2002. He served as a Deputy in the National Assembly of France from 1997 to 2002, and he has served in the Senate of France between 2004 and 2017.

Hue was a candidate in the 1995 presidential election, in which he received 8.7% of the vote, and in the 2002 presidential election, in which he won 3.37%.

He is married to Marie-Édith, and he is father of two (Charles and Cécilia).

==Early activities==
Hue was born in Cormeilles-en-Parisis, Val-d&#x27;Oise in 1946. His family professed Communist beliefs, and Hue, as a child, sold issues of the Party newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;. He studied at the technical school in Cormeilles-en-Parisis, sang in a rock band called &quot;Les Rapaces&quot; under the alias &quot;Willy Barton&quot;, and practiced judo (winning an intercollegiate medal and receiving a black belt &quot;nidan&quot;).

Age sixteen (1962), he entered the youth section of the PCF, and then the Party itself. After studying in Paris and becoming an orderly, he was employed in a psychiatrical institution in Argenteuil.

Close to Georges Marchais, Hue climbed the steps in the Party hierarchy, being also elected mayor of Montigny-lès-Cormeilles in 1977. He was to be reelected for all possible terms, until 2001. In February 1981, he was brought briefly under the spotlight, by starting a campaign against a family of immigrants, whom he had accused of selling drugs (a &quot;charge&quot; that was based mainly on hearsay). This seemed strange to the public opinion in France, as Hue had been (and was to remain) a strict follower of the Party lines.

In 1987, Hue joined the Party&#x27;s Central Committee and, in 1990, its Politburo. At that time, he presided the National association of Communist elects. In 1994, while still largely unknown, Hue was appointed successor by Georges Marchais. Hue changed renamed the office of Secretary General &quot;National Secretary&quot; in an effort to refresh the party&#x27;s image. He did become quite well known only a few hours later, when he uttered a famous lapsus linguae: &quot;I&#x27;m not nobody&#x27;s pawn&quot;.

==Hue and Party reform==
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, faced with the rapid erosion of his party, Robert Hue started a series of political transformations: openness to other political movements, discarding of several doctrines, a double-headed Party executive (with Hue as president and Marie-George Buffet as national secretary), etc. He made his approach public through his book, &quot;Communisme : la mutation&quot;.

Robert Hue&#x27;s low percentage in 1995 is explained by the competition from Workers&#x27; Struggle, but it was still more than André Lajoinie&#x27;s result in 1988. In 1997, he stood by the idea of &quot;Gauche Plurielle&quot; (&quot;Pluralist Left&quot;) which brought the leftist politics back in power with Lionel Jospin; Hue became a deputy, and the government included a number of Communists.

However, the Party was falling out of favor with the public: from over 200,000 members in 1998, it dropped to 138,000 in 2001. The Party lost a good deal of allegiances during the 2001 municipal elections.

Hue created and assumed in 2001 the title of President of the Party. His successor as National secretary of the party was Marie-George Buffet.

The poor result in 2002 made the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen cheer the death of Communist strength. In fact, the outcome was so bad that the Party did not have anything to show for the money it had invested in its campaign, and verged on financial collapse. Hue resigned the Presidency while the Party appealed to the generosity of its members. The Presidency was abolished, the National Secretary (Buffet) remaining as the Party&#x27;s sole leader.

<doc id="215903" wikidata="Q268253" url="?curid=215903" title="Neo soul">
<text>Neo soul (sometimes called progressive soul) is a genre of popular music. As a term, it was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&amp;B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&amp;B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from funk, jazz fusion, and hip hop, and to pop, rock, and electronic music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&amp;B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.

Neo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, by Black-Americans in the United States, as a soul revival movement. It earned mainstream success during the 1990s, with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several artists, including D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, and Lauryn Hill. Their music was marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally approached R&amp;B of the time, although many of them were ambivalent about the term.

Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&amp;B, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both American and international artists. Its mainstream presence declined during the 2000s, although newer artists emerged through more independent means of marketing their music. In his book &quot;The Essential Neo Soul&quot; (2010), music journalist and culture critic Chris Campbell writes that, while the genre has been &quot;woefully misunderstood and its artists mis-marketed&quot;, there is &quot;a historical and social relevance that validates its designation as the current face of alternative progressive soul music (in both underground and overground circles), complete with a distinct origin and developmental evolution&quot;. According to Mark Anthony Neal, &quot;neo-soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop.&quot;

== Etymology ==
As a term, &quot;neo soul&quot; was coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records in the late 1990s as a marketing category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s 1995 debut album &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term&#x27;s origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended at some point in time. In a 2002 interview for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.

In a 2010 article for PopMatters, music writer Tyler Lewis said that neo soul has been received with much controversy: &quot;Given the way black music has been named by (usually) outsiders ever since the blues, the reaction to the name by artists who ostensibly fit into the &#x27;neo-soul&#x27; category represents a wonderful example of black self-determination in an industry that is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks.&quot; Jason Anderson of CBC News compares the etymology of neo soul to that of &quot;new wave&quot; and comments: &quot;As imperfect as the term may be, neo-soul is still an effective tag to describe the mix of chic modernity and time-honoured tradition that distinguished the genre&#x27;s best examples. Neo-soul artists tried to look both backward and forward, acting in the belief that a continuum might exist.&quot;

== Characteristics ==
Despite some ambivalence from artists, the term received widespread use by music critics and writers who wrote about artists and albums associated with the musical style. African American studies professor Mark Anthony Neal has described neo soul as &quot;everything from avant-garde R&amp;B to organic soul ... a product of trying to develop something outside of the norm in R&amp;B&quot;. According to music writers, the genre&#x27;s works are mostly album-oriented and distinguished by its musicianship and production, incorporating &quot;organic&quot; elements of classic soul music with the use of live instrumentation, in contrast to the more single-oriented, hip hop-based, and producer-driven sampling approach of contemporary R&amp;B. Neo soul also incorporates elements of electronic music, jazz fusion, funk, rap, gospel, rock, reggae, and African music. In her book &quot;Musical Rhythm in the Age of Digital Reproduction&quot;, music author Anne Danielsen wrote that neo soul toward the end of the 1990s exhibited a musical development that was part of &quot;a remarkable increase in musicians&#x27; experimentation with and manipulation of grooves at the microrhythmic level – that is, the level in played music that is usually understood in terms of phrasing and timing.&quot;

Noting that most of the genre&#x27;s artists are singer-songwriters, writers have viewed their lyrical content as more &quot;conscious-driven&quot; and having a broader range than most other R&amp;B artists. AllMusic calls it &quot;roughly analogous to contemporary R&amp;B.&quot; Dimitri Ehrlich of &quot;Vibe&quot; said that they &quot;emphasize a mix of elegant, jazz-tinged R&amp;B and subdued hip hop, with a highly idiosyncratic, deeply personal approach to love and politics&quot;. Music writers have noted that neo soul artists are predominantly female, which contrasts the marginalized presence of women in mainstream hip hop and R&amp;B. Jason Anderson of CBC News called neo soul a &quot;sinuous, sly yet unabashedly earnest&quot; alternative and &quot;kind of haven for listeners turned off by the hedonism of mainstream hip-hop and club jams.&quot; Neo soul artists are often associated with alternative lifestyles and fashions, including organic food, incense, and knit caps.

According to music writer Peter Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from older R&amp;B styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R&amp;B counterparts. In a 1998 article on neo soul, &quot;Time&quot; journalist Christopher John Farley wrote that singers such as Hill, D&#x27;Angelo, and Maxwell &quot;share a willingness to challenge musical orthodoxy&quot;. Miles Marshall Lewis commented that 1990s neo soul &quot;owed its to &#x27;70s soul superstars like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder&quot;, adding that &quot;in concert, Erykah Badu and D&#x27;Angelo regularly covered Chaka Khan, the Ohio Players, and Al Green, to make the lineage crystal clear.&quot; In citing Tony! Toni! Toné! as progenitors of the genre, Tony Green of &quot;Vibe&quot; viewed that the group pioneered the &quot;digital-analog hybrid sound&quot; of neo soul and &quot;dramatically refreshed the digitalized wasteland that was R&amp;B in the late &#x27;80s&quot;. Neo soul artists during the 1990s were heavily inspired by the eclectic sound and mellow instrumentation of Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s and Brian Jackson&#x27;s collaborative work in the 1970s. &quot;All About Jazz&quot; cited Jackson as &quot;one of the early architects&quot; of the sound and his early work with Scott-Heron as &quot;an inspirational and musical Rosetta stone for the neo-soul movement&quot;.
== History ==

=== 1980s–early 1990s: Stylistic origins ===
Neo soul originated in the 1980s and early 1990s, with the work of musical acts such as Prince, Tony! Toni! Toné!, Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, Joi, and Mint Condition, whose music deviated from the conventions of most contemporary R&amp;B at the time. Tony! Toni! Toné!-member Raphael Saadiq later embarked on a solo career and produced various works of other neo soul artists. Influential to neo soul, UK act Sade achieved success in the 1980s with music that featured a smooth jazzy style of pop rock called sophisti-pop. The band was part of a new wave of British R&amp;B-oriented artists during the late-1980s and early 1990s that also included Soul II Soul, Caron Wheeler, The Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai, and Lisa Stansfield. AllMusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson writes that, &quot;Many of the British artists who emerged during that period had a neo-soul outlook and were able to blend influences from different eras&quot;. Other British progenitors of the neo soul movement at the time included Young Disciples and Omar Lye-Fook, the latter of whom has been cited as &quot;the father of British neo-soul&quot; and an influence on many future artists.

According to Christopher John Farley, Prince had been &quot;carrying a torch for neo soul for decades, refusing to make R&amp;B that played by the rules or fit into comfortable formats. In the mid-&#x27;90s, he was suddenly joined by a host of other soul artists who also wanted to break boundaries&quot;. American artists that further popularized this sound during the early 1990s included Zhané, Groove Theory, Joi, Tony Rich, and Me&#x27;Shell NdegéOcello.

NdegéOcello&#x27;s 1993 debut album &quot;Plantation Lullabies&quot; was later credited as the beginning of neo soul; according to Renee Graham of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, it was &quot;arguably the first shot in the so-called &#x27;neo-soul&#x27; movement&quot;. The success of Tony! Toni! Toné!&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Sons of Soul&quot; was also viewed as a precursor to the soul music revival in the mid-1990s. Cheo Hodari Coker said in 1997 that the album &quot;largely sparked the soul music revival that has opened the door for a new generation of singers who build on the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder&quot;. Allmusic editor Leo Stanley wrote that by the release of Tony! Toni! Toné!&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;House of Music&quot; in 1996, &quot;their influence was beginning to be apparent, as younger soul singer-songwriters like Tony Rich and Maxwell began reaching the R&amp;B charts. Like Tony! Toni! Toné!, Rich and Maxwell relied on traditional soul and R&amp;B values of songwriting and live performances, discarding the synth-heavy productions of the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s&quot;.

A few hip hop groups are cited as well. Malcolm Venable of &quot;Vibe&quot; highlights the early work of hip hop band The Roots, who used live instrumentation, as a precursor to neo soul&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in the mid-1990s. Kierna Mayo, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Ebony&quot;, said that alternative hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s early 1990s albums &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; and &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; &quot;gave birth to neo-everything  ... That entire class of D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, Maxwell, and Lauryn Hill&quot;.

=== Mid–late 1990s: Mainstream breakthrough ===
In 1995, former corporate marketer turned artist manager Kedar Massenburg established the record label Kedar Entertainment Inc., through which he released the breakthrough neo soul recordings of artists such as Badu, D&#x27;Angelo, and Chico DeBarge. Music journalists have specifically credited the successes of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1995), Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Urban Hang Suite&quot; (1996), Badu&#x27;s &quot;Baduizm&quot; (1997), and Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (1998) with shaping and raising the neo soul movement to commercial visibility into the late 1990s. According to Farley, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s album &quot;gives a nod to the past, ... mints his own sound, with golden humming keyboards and sensual vocals and unhurried melodies ... His songs were polished without being slick and smart without being pretentious&quot;, while Badu &quot;brought an iconoclastic spirit to soul music, with her towering Afrocentric headwraps, incense candles, and quirky lyrics&quot;. &quot;Baduizm&quot; sold nearly three million copies and won Badu two Grammy Awards. Hill&#x27;s &quot;Miseducation&quot; album featured her singing and rapping, with deeply personal lyrics, and was one of neo soul&#x27;s primary successes, achieving massive sales, critical acclaim, and five Grammy Awards. The 1997 film &quot;Love Jones&quot; capitalized on neo soul&#x27;s success at the time with its soundtrack album, which impacted the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and featured artists such as Hill, Maxwell, The Brand New Heavies, Me&#x27;Shell NdegéOcello, Groove Theory, and Dionne Farris.

After a brief marketing downturn, neo soul gained more mainstream popularity in 1999 with commercial successes by Hill, Maxwell, Eric Benét, Saadiq, and Les Nubians. It impacted mainstream radio while influencing contemporary R&amp;B acts, such as R. Kelly and Aaliyah, to incorporate some of its textural and lyrical elements. In Kelly&#x27;s song &quot;When a Woman&#x27;s Fed Up&quot; (1998), the singer incorporated a more soul-based sound and referenced Badu&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Tyrone&quot; in the lyrics. Other female artists broke through with their debut albums, including Macy Gray, Angie Stone, and Jill Scott. Although Scott&#x27;s album &quot;Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1&quot; would not see release until 2000, she co-wrote and sang on &quot;You Got Me&quot; (the 1999 hit single by hip hop band The Roots) and received further exposure as a supporting performer on the band&#x27;s tour that year. &quot;Thanks to her stint on &#x27;You Got Me&#x27; and subsequent live shows&quot;, Joel McIver wrote, &quot;Scott can be credited as the first female artist to emerge in Erykah Badu&#x27;s wake who could seriously claim to have challenged her superiority at the top of the neo-soul tree&quot;.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the musical collective Soulquarians—consisting of such artists as D&#x27;Angelo, The Roots, Erykah Badu, Bilal, Mos Def, Common, James Poyser, J Dilla and Q-Tip—contributed significantly to the neo soul movement with what Greg Kot described as its members&#x27; &quot;organic soul, natural R&amp;B, boho-rap&quot;. The collective developed through the production work of The Roots&#x27; drummer and producer Questlove.

=== Early 2000s: Height of hype ===


In 2000, D&#x27;Angelo released his second album &quot;Voodoo&quot;, serving as a further alternative to the mainstream of late 1990s R&amp;B and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in the new decade. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the album &quot;the succes d&#x27;estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles&quot;. The year also saw Badu&#x27;s second album &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot;, by which time the singer had been dubbed by writers as &quot;the queen of neo-soul&quot;, although she said of the honorific title, &quot;I hated that because what if I don&#x27;t do that anymore? What if I change? Then that puts me in a penitentiary.&quot; Scott&#x27;s first album &quot;Who Is Jill Scott?&quot; sold millions worldwide and proved one of the genre&#x27;s significant releases.
Other successful performers marketed as neo soul at this time included Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; (2001). According to AllMusic biographer Andy Kellman, although Bilal may have been the &quot;one R&amp;B artist for whom the neo-soul categorization seemed limiting&quot;, his 2001 debut album &quot;1st Born Second&quot; was an &quot;exemplary&quot; release for the genre and a top-10 R&amp;B chart success. Hip hop acts such as The Roots and Common, also associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul: &quot;Phrenology&quot; (2002) and &quot;Electric Circus&quot; (2003). Commenting on neo soul&#x27;s hype, Daphne Brooks wrote in 2004, &quot;The increasing attention paid to heavily hyped &#x27;neo-soul&#x27; artists such as Jill Scott and Indie.arie ... suggest[s] that cultural memory is now recognized as a marketable aesthetic strategy of expression in contemporary pop.&quot;

=== Mid–late 2000s: Mainstream decline ===
The 2000s later featured a decline in output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu&#x27;s commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut &quot;Baduizm&quot; departed further from that album&#x27;s music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut—considered the best-selling neo soul album—with a combative, confessional live album (2002&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot;) in which she expresses her misgivings about fame, and her recording career diminished soon after. Melena Ryzik of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a retrospective piece on that &quot;era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters&quot;, stating &quot;many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success.&quot; Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists&#x27; regression from the mainstream, saying &quot;I think most of us went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career.&quot; Other artists such as D&#x27;Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from &quot;PopMatters&quot; attributed the decline to &quot;the downside of [the] rejection of the term [&#x27;neo soul&#x27;]&quot;, going on to say:

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Renée Graham wrote of the artists&#x27; ambivalence towards the term in a 2003 article on neo soul&#x27;s standing, &quot;Despite its critical success, if neo-soul had an initial failing, it was the media-created label itself – a term that the artists, whom it was meant to represent, generally rejected&quot;. In a 2003 interview, music publicist John Constanza said that &quot;The neo-soul movement is still there, but it&#x27;s been underground, and it&#x27;s trying to get the attention of the mainstream again&quot;. Mark Edward Nero of About.com stated, &quot;In general, neo-soul has remained almost exclusive to R&amp;B outlets such as urban radio and Black Entertainment Television ... the majority of neo-soul artists have yet to crossover to mainstream American music listeners, partially because the music&#x27;s sound generally focuses on artist expression, rather than popular appeal&quot;.

After D&#x27;Angelo and Hill&#x27;s withdrawal from the mainstream, Bilal appeared to be another artist from &quot;the soul music vanguard&quot; of the late 1990s and early 2000s to succumb to professional setbacks and fade from the public view, after his heavily bootlegged album &quot;Love for Sale&quot; was shelved in 2006, although it developed an underground following in subsequent years. Smash Gordon, of the Fabric club&#x27;s blog, later called the leak &quot;one of the biggest mysteries in neo-soul history&quot;.

In the latter part of the decade, emerging artists such as Heather Headley, Anthony David, J Davey, Eric Roberson, and Ledisi signed to independent soul labels and received exposure through independent retailers, neo soul-oriented web sites, college and public radio stations, city club venues, cable networks such as Music Choice and BET J, and publishing deals as writers and producers for major label-recording artists. Erykah Badu and Maxwell returned from their respective hiatuses and released well-received albums, her &quot;New Amerykah&quot; albums and his 2009 album &quot;BLACKsummers&#x27;night&quot;, and they subsequently toured together. VH1 Soul&#x27;s series &quot;Soulstage&quot;, which began in 2007, showcased new music by artists such as Badu, Jill Scott, India.Arie, Q-Tip, and Saadiq.

=== 2010s–present: Late period ===

Since its original popularity, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both American and international artists. The more popular neo soul artists of the 2010s included Scott, Maxwell, John Legend, Anthony Hamilton, Amy Winehouse, Chrisette Michele, Leela James, and Raheem DeVaughn. DeVaughn has described himself as an &quot;R&amp;B Hippy Neo-Soul Rock Star&quot;, viewing it as a reference to his eclectic musical style. In its 2010 issue on critical moments in popular music, &quot;Spin&quot; cited D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo&quot; and its success as a turning point for neo soul: &quot;D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s pastiche of funk, carnal ache, and high-minded, Afrocentric rhetoric stands as neo-soul&#x27;s crowning achievement. So unsurpassable that it&#x27;d be eight years before we&#x27;d hear from Erykah Badu and Maxwell again, while Hill and D&#x27;Angelo remain missing. But Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Cee-Lo picked up D&#x27;s mantle and ran with it&quot;. Evan Rytlewski of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; discerns &quot;a line of revelatory, late-period neo-soul albums&quot; with the releases of Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;BLACKsummers&#x27;night&quot; (2009), Badu&#x27;s &quot;New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)&quot; (2010), Bilal&#x27;s &quot;Airtight&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2010), and Frank Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Channel Orange&quot; (2012). In the 2010s and 2020s, other neo soul acts included Tyler, The Creator, Fitz and the Tantrums, Mayer Hawthorne, Nathaniel Rateliff &amp; the Night Sweats, Sol Chyld and Amos Lee.

In August 2019, Okayplayer journalist Keith Nelson Jr. published a piece highlighting 11 recording artists who are &quot;on the precipice of pushing neo-soul forward&quot; into its third decade of existence: Steve Lacy (&quot;cut from the abstract neo-soul cloth of Frank Ocean where you’re just as likely to have a jam session as you are to hear philosophical quips&quot;), Mahalia (&quot;singer-songwriter, with honeyed vocals … songs of love and anguish typically exist in narratives, similar to Jill Scott, who paved her path&quot;), Adrian Daniel (&quot;experimentation and vulnerability that is reminiscent of fellow Brooklynite Maxwell&quot;), VanJess (&quot;sister duo float between the soulful chemistry of Floetry and the unapologetically assertive of City Girls … artful sexual empowerment&quot;), Donovan (&quot;avant-garde singer and instrumentalist … bedroom intimate vocals and [emotive] production&quot;), Ari Lennox (&quot;can make Tinder plights sound rich with soul … akin to Erykah Badu&quot;), Marco McKinnis (&quot;Anthony Hamilton meets D&#x27;Angelo … hazy ambient sounds&quot;), Baby Rose (&quot;exquisitely guttural voice makes [love] palpable&quot;), Kyle Dion (&quot;a register so high it sounded like tearful begging&quot;), Lucky Daye (&quot;his love odes are imbued with a Raphael Saadiq-esque adventurousness&quot;), and Iman Omari (&quot;a faint Bilal tinge … music that leans heavy on a jazz/hip-hop&quot;).

<text>The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to as the Nation of Gods and Earths (NGE/NOGE) or the Five Percenters, is an Afro-American Nationalist movement influenced by the Nation of Islam founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by Clarence 13X, who was previously known as Clarence Edward Smith.

Members of the group call themselves Allah&#x27;s Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world are elites and their agents, who know the truth of existence and opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the eighty-five percent.

The Nation of Gods and Earths teaches the belief that Black people are the original people of the planet Earth and are therefore the fathers (&quot;Gods&quot;) and mothers (&quot;Earths&quot;) of civilization. The Nation teaches that Supreme Mathematics and Supreme Alphabet, a set of principles created by Allah the Father, is the key to understanding humankind&#x27;s relationship to the universe. The Nation teaches that the black man, insofar as the Nation defines this race, is himself God, with the black race being a race of actual gods.

== History ==
=== Founding ===

The Nation of Gods and Earths was founded by Clarence 13X after he left the Nation of Islam (NOI)&#x27;s Temple Number Seven in Harlem, New York, the same temple where Malcolm X was a minister from 1960 to 1963. Multiple stories exist as to why Clarence and the NOI parted ways: Some state he refused to give up gambling. Others state he questioned the unique divinity of Wallace Fard Muhammad, whom the NOI deified as the true and living God in person, or that he questioned Fard&#x27;s godhood due to the fact that Fard was born of a white mother. One story states that he was disciplined by the NOI and excommunicated in 1963, but another version of events says that he left of his own free will.

After leaving the NOI, he renamed himself &quot;Allah the Father&quot;. He was joined by Abu Shahid, formerly John 37X, who agreed with Allah&#x27;s questioning of Wallace Fard Muhammad. Allah the Father and Shahid were nicknamed &quot;High Scientists&quot; due to their intense study of lessons. Allah was joined by Justice, formerly James 109X, and before that, James Howell, who became one of Allah&#x27;s closest associates until his death.

Allah proselytized the streets of Harlem, to teach others his views based on his interpretation of NOI teachings. After failing to reach elder adults whom he saw as already set in their ways, he found success with street youth. On October 10, 1964, this young group formed the First Nine Born of what became known as the Five-Percent Nation, or later the Nation of Gods and Earths.

Allah taught his Black male students that they were Gods, just as he was. He taught them that the astral twin of the Black man is the Sun. In Supreme Mathematics, the Black man is symbolized as &quot;Knowledge.&quot; The Black women who came into Father Allah&#x27;s growing movement to study along with the males were taught they were symbolic of the planet Earth, because women produce and sustain human existence as does the Earth. 

Female Five Percenters are also referred to as &quot;Wisdom.&quot; The Nation of Gods and Earths&#x27; &quot;Supreme Wisdom&quot; states: &quot;Wisdom is the Original Woman because life is continued through her cipher (womb).&quot; The NGE does not consider itself a religion. Its position is that it makes no sense to be religious or to worship or deify anyone or anything outside of oneself because adherents, themselves, are the highest power in the known universe, both collectively and individually. 

Allah the Father developed a curriculum of eight lessons that included the Supreme Alphabets and Mathematics, which he devised, as well as lessons developed by the Nation of Islam&#x27;s Elijah Muhammad and Wallace Fard Muhammad. The eight lessons were taught in this order, which follows below:

# Supreme Mathematics (1–10)
# Supreme Alphabets (1–26)
# Student Enrollment (1–10)
# English Lesson C-1 (1–36)
# Lost-Found Muslim Lesson No. 1 (1–14)
# Lost-Found Muslim Lesson No. 2 (1–40)
# Actual Facts (13)
# Solar Facts (9)

Each Five Percenter was required to fully &quot;master&quot; each lesson and was expected to be able to &quot;think and reason by forming profound relationships between the lessons and significant experiences within life.&quot; Five Percenters were required to share what they had learned with others, and thereby recruit new members.

=== Social and political influence ===
The FBI opened a file on the Five Percenters in 1965, the height of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements in the United States. In &quot;Disturbance by Group Called &#x27;Five Percenters,&#x27;&quot; the FBI refers to the organization as a &quot;loosely knit group of Negro youth gangs. ... These particular gangs emanate from New York City Public School Number 120 which is a junior high school.&quot; The FBI file stated that the organization&#x27;s name meant &quot;The five percent of the Muslims who smoke and drink.&quot; 

1965 New York newspaper articles referred to the Five Percenters as a &quot;gang,&quot; &quot;hoodlums,&quot; and &quot;terror group.&quot; Allah the Father and the Five Percenters &quot;had a reputation for being unreachable, anti-white criminals.&quot; With the goal of preventing New York from having a race riot or uprising, New York Mayor John V. Lindsay sent Barry Gottehrer, the head of the mayor&#x27;s Urban Task Force, to meet with the organization the FBI had called a &quot;gang&quot; and &quot;terror group.&quot; Gottehrer stated Allah the Father was non-violent, &quot;but was dedicated to his community&#x27;s well-being.&quot; 

Gottehrer and Allah began organizing picnics and airplane rides for the Five Percenters that were funded by New York City through the Urban Task Force. Wakeel Allah&#x27;s book &quot;In the Name of Allah&quot; includes a photo captioned: &quot;Allah (in background) along with Mayor Lindsay (holding baby) on airplane ride with Five Percenters.&quot; In 1967, Father Allah, with Gottehrer&#x27;s assistance, opened the Urban League Street Academy, which became known as the Allah School in Mecca.

In 1967, shortly after Allah and Justice started holding classes at the Street Academy, Civil Rights leader Bayard Rustin and Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke visited Father Allah at the Academy. In an article titled &quot;The Five Percenters,&quot; published in &quot;The New Amsterdam News,&quot; Rustin wroteWe might all applaud the Street Academy as one of the most constructive contributions to the maintenance of stability in the Harlem Community, as well as creating an effective instrument for the rehabilitation of young men who might otherwise have no choice but the streets. ... Besides their academic and social activities, the Five Percenters told me that they pursue a spiritual ideal of &quot;helping others discover a true knowledge of themselves.&quot; They said they are &quot;neither anti-white nor pro-black.&quot; 

Allah the Father stated that he was &quot;neither pro-black nor anti-white.&quot; In his &quot;National Statement&quot; given at Brookdale College in Monmouth County, New Jersey, in 1998, Dumar Wa&#x27;de Allah, National Spokesman for the NGE, stated &quot;we are not anti-white, nor pro-black. In fact, we have white Five Percenters.&quot; NGE websites and articles state, &quot;We as a collective are not anti-white nor pro-black. We are pro-righteous and anti-devilishment.&quot;

There have been from the organization&#x27;s inception Five Percenters of various ethnicities. The most well-known white Five Percenter is John Michael Kennedy, who met Allah in 1965. Allah proclaimed Kennedy a &quot;righteous man&quot; and renamed him Azreal. Michael M. Knight&#x27;s &quot;The Five Percenters&quot; includes a photo of a gathering of Five Percenters that includes Barkim, who Knight describes as &quot;one of the earliest white Five Percenters&quot; and his siblings. Knight&#x27;s book includes two photos of Allah with Gottehrer, who Allah called &quot;Moses.&quot; 

In 2018, members of the Five Percent Nation and Harlem community members applied to the Transportation/Historic Preservation &amp; Landmarks Committee of Manhattan Community Board 10, to have the northwest corner of 126th Street &amp; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd in Harlem, New York, co-named “Allah, Justice &amp; The Five Percenters Square.” The application and subsequent proposal were approved by Manhattan Community Board 10 and the New York City Council. In March 2019, the intersection of 126th Street &amp; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd in New York was officially co-named &quot;Allah, Justice &amp; The Five Percenters Square.&quot;

=== Conflicts ===
After the founding of the Allah School, the Gods and Earths became more influentialupon the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., it quelled a potential rebellion inside Harlem. Allah was assassinated on the 13 June 1969, in the lobby of 21 West 112th Street in Harlem, within the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers housing projects, the residence of his wife and children. There have been rumors and theories about assailants and motives, but the murder remains unsolved. The murder was a blow to the movement. According to the direct orders of Allah before his death, some of his earliest disciples, a group of nine men who were called the First Nine Born carried on the teachings, and his friend Justice assumed an acting leadership role.

The FBI&#x27;s labeling the Five Percenters as a &quot;gang&quot; in 1965 has caused much trouble for Gods and Earths in the United States. The &quot;gang&quot; label has caused individuals with even remote NGE affiliation to be designated as security threats in jails and prisons in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and South Carolina. NGE literature has been banned from penal institutions in these and other states, and inmates have been denied privileges enjoyed by those of other persuasions. Such rules were relaxed in 2004 in New York to allow registered &quot;sincere adherent(s)&quot; to study teachings personally, but not share with unregistered inmates during their incarceration.

The group&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Five Percenter&quot;, condemns the states who impose restrictions on their practice as those who &quot;attempt to define us in ways that seek to criminalize us.&quot; In 2009, in Michigan, the Nation challenged a ban on the group&#x27;s literature among prison inmates, after an inmate was designated a security threat until he renounced his membership. Judge Steven Whalen found no evidence that the group advocated violence and recommended that it be recognized as a legitimate belief system.

== Beliefs ==
=== Basis ===
The men of the Five Percent Nation view themselves as Gods, both individually and collectively as the &quot;Original Man&quot;. According to the &quot;Five Percenter Newspaper&quot;, &quot;God first means that it is no longer a judicial argument; centered means everything we do is about God. Culture is the practices and principles of a people at any given time.&quot; Gods and Earths sometimes refer to themselves as scientists, implying their search for knowledge and proof.

The teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths are passed on through a modern oral tradition. The advancement of a God or Earth is based on his or her memorization, recitation, comprehension, and practical application of the Supreme Mathematics and the Supreme Alphabet and also the 120 Lessons, sometimes referred to as degrees, a revised version of the Supreme Wisdom lessons of the NOI, originally written by Wallace Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad. 

The anthology &quot;Knowledge of Self: A Collection of Wisdom on the Science of Everything in Life&quot; by Supreme Understanding details the teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths. Wakeel Allah has written &quot;In the Name of Allah: A History of Clarence 13X and the 5 Percenters&quot; and &quot;The Naked Truth: From the Goal Mind of Abu Shahid, the Elder of the Nation of Gods and Earths&quot;.

=== &quot;Five Percent&quot; ===
The term &quot;Five Percenter&quot; is taken directly from the &quot;Five Percent&quot; who are described in &quot;Lost-Found Muslim Lesson No. 2&quot; of the Nation of Islam. The lesson groups the people of the world into three categories. Eighty-five percent of the world&#x27;s population are described as &quot;uncivilized people; poison animal eaters; slaves from mental death and power, people who do not know the Living God or their origin in this world, and they worship that which they do not know. ... [They] are easily led in the wrong direction, but hard to lead into the right direction.&quot;

Ten percent of the world&#x27;s population are described as &quot;The rich; the slave-makers of the poor; who teach the poor lies—to believe that the Almighty, True and Living God is a spook and cannot be seen by the physical eye. Otherwise known as: The Blood-Suckers of the Poor.&quot;

Five Percent of the world&#x27;s population are described as &quot;the poor, righteous Teachers, who do not believe in the teachings of the 10%, and are all-wise; and know who the Living God is; and Teach that the Living God is the Sun of man, the supreme being, the (Black man) of Asia; and Teach Freedom, Justice and Equality to all the human family of the planet Earth.&quot;

=== The Universal Language ===

The Supreme Mathematics and Supreme Alphabet are key concepts in the Five Percent Nation. The Supreme mathematics is a system of understanding numerals alongside concepts and qualitative representations that are used along with the Supreme Alphabet. The Supreme Mathematics is thought to be the highest system of numerology in the NGE, used to give qualitative value to numbers in addition to quantity. How the values associated with each number were derived is unknown. The numerals are as follows:

* 1. Knowledge
* 2. Wisdom
* 3. Understanding
* 4. Culture or Freedom
* 5. Power or Refinement
* 6. Equality
* 7. God
* 8. Build or Destroy
* 9. Born (Birth)
* 0. Cipher

The Supreme Alphabet is a system of interpreting text and finding deeper meaning from the NOI Lessons, by assigning actual meanings to the letters of the Latin script. For example, the first letter, A, stands for Allah; the 12th letter, L, stands for Love, Hell, or Right; and the 13th letter, M, stands for Master. The Supreme Alphabet was developed by Allah the Father and Justice. The method by which letters were associated with certain values is unknown.

=== Customs ===

The Five-Percent Nation holds events known as Universal Parliaments in various cities—usually once a month—to build on their interpretation of the Supreme Mathematics, lessons, and to discuss business concerning the NGE. These meetings usually take place in public areas and can be held anywhere.

Because the NGE defines itself as a way of life and not a religion, the Nation generally does not observe religious holidays, including those associated with Christianity or Islam. Many Five Percenters honor Allah the Father&#x27;s birthday on February 22, and/or the official founding of the Nation on October 10, with special events and parliaments. The Show and Prove is an annual event that takes place in Harlem every second weekend in June.

Similar to adherents of denominations of traditional Islam, Five Percenters abstain from eating pork or any pork-based by-products. According to Five Percenter Universal Shaamguadd, Allah the Father stated Five Percenters should avoid eating &quot;small scavengers, such as shrimp,&quot; and avoid &quot;lobsters, crabs, clams, and oysters.&quot; Some Five Percenters take further steps and eschew meat altogether, often opting for &quot;strict&quot; vegetarianism. Allah the Father advocated &quot;eating one meal a day, every other day or every third days, as prescribed in the Nation of Islam.&quot; Allah was a proponent of fasting and many new adherents fast as part of &quot;an induction process.&quot;

=== Teachings on race ===
The teachings of Five-Percent Nation have been accused of promoting Black supremacy. As in the Nation of Islam, Five Percenters believe that the original inhabitants of the world were Black, which they refer to as the &quot;Asiatic Blackman&quot; and believe had inhabited the earth for &quot;66 trillion years&quot;, who ultimately descended from the Tribe of Shabazz, while the white race are evil &quot;devils&quot; who were created 6,000 years ago on what is today the Greek island of Patmos, by a “rogue bigheaded scientist” named Yakub, the Biblical and Qur&#x27;anic Jacob, who was of the Meccan branch of the tribe. After the whites attempted to rise up against their creators, they were exiled to the caves of &quot;West Asia&quot; – what would later be known as Europe. The Yakub origin story is the basis for all Five Percenter racial understanding.

=== Gender perceptions ===
Some Five Percenters have been accused of promoting male chauvinism and misogyny. According to Prince Allah Cuba, since the death of Allah the Father, some Gods have grown preoccupied with male supremacy, and this preoccupation has resulted in the minimization of all things female: from the crescent moon on the nation&#x27;s flag being made smaller and eventually placed under the number seven, to the lack of parity in the God-Earth dyad. 

According to the Five Percent Nation, each member constitutes a divine being in his or her own right. Some males promote the minimization of women, as with Lord Jamar&#x27;s lyric that woman is &quot;secondary but most necessary.&quot; Others describe the Black woman as the Black man&#x27;s equal: In X Clan&#x27;s song &quot;Wiz Degrees,&quot; Five Percenter Brother J describes his partner as &quot;Wisdom and the Goddess manifest.&quot; Ladybug Mecca, a Five Percenter and the female member of the hip hop group Digable Planets, offers her view of gender and divinity: We need to know that there is a feminine and masculine principal or consciousness that is considered the God or the Creator. It&#x27;s not a male, like religion will tell you. It&#x27;s a mother/father principle, a masculine/feminine principle. /. . . ./ The feminine principle is what gives birth to the universe. It&#x27;s what brings creation forth, so there has to be an acknowledgement and respect for her in order to bring back the balance. In religion, in Christianity and in Islam, in all religions ... it&#x27;s a perverted piece of the truth, when it doesn&#x27;t hold the woman on a pedestal. 

Five Percenter &quot;Just I C Equality Allah&quot;, asserts that gender equality is an inherent aspect of ALLAH: &quot;How can woman not be God as well as man? First of all, we are the Arm Leg Leg Arm Head (Allah). There is no gender type, we all have the components that make the physical. Allah is the all in all. How can we be the all in all if &quot;all&quot; isn&#x27;t included?&quot; When Allah the Father was alive, some female Five Percenters referred to themselves as Goddesses. A Five Percent female named Tawanna referred to herself as God. When challenged by some male Five Percenters, Tawanna defended her position and was declared by Justice to be &quot;more God than some of the men!&quot;

== Hip hop ==
The majority of allusions to Islam in American hip-hop, either conscious or otherwise, spawn from adherents of the Five Percenters. In its article on Five Percenter Jay Electronica, &quot;Vice Magazine&quot; stated in regard to the Five Percent Nation: &quot;It&#x27;s a movement that&#x27;s been affiliated with hip-hop from the very beginning, coining terms like &#x27;ciphers&#x27; and &#x27;dropping science&#x27; and influencing everyone, World&#x27;s Famous Supreme Team, Big Daddy Kane, Busta Rhymes, J. Cole, Jay-Z, Method Man, Rakim, Wu-Tang Clan, Brand Nubian, Nas, Common, Poor Righteous Teachers, Erykah Badu, and AZ. With these artists, and any others associated with the Five Percenters, music was more than just a message.&quot;

The Nation of Gods and Earths has propagated its teachings throughout the United States and abroad. In the early 1980s, this spread was in part due to early adherents teaching when away at college or in the military and, more famously, because of the rise of hip hop music. The main theme of the NGE doctrine spoken on hip hop records were the teachings that black people were the original or first human life to walk the planet, that the Blackman is God, the Blackwoman is Earth, and through the inner esoteric powers of the Gods and Earths, the youth can transform and possess its true potential, which aspires to overthrow the overbearing oligarchy by becoming just rulers of themselves. This especially meshed well with conscious themes found in other golden-age hip hop recordings.

Early hip-hop acts affiliated with the Five Percenters, and who spread its teachings through hip hop, include two MCs of the late 1980s–early &#x27;90s conscious-rap era—Rakim of Eric B. &amp; Rakim and Big Daddy Kane. These two acts, as well as some of their other contemporaries, infused Five-Percent teachings and symbolism throughout their music and videos. This reputation brought fans of Rakim in particular to refer to him as the God MC.

After Rakim and Kane&#x27;s heyday, rose acts that were even more explicit with allegiance to the NGE, most notably Brand Nubian, Poor Righteous Teachers, Wu-Tang Clan, Killarmy, Sunz of Man, Gravediggaz and Busta Rhymes. The popularity of these acts sparked a boom of new NGE students. The hip hop group 3rd Bass, whose MC&#x27;s Prime Minister Pete Nice and MC Serch were white and Jewish, respectively, cited NGE lessons in the song &quot;Triple Stage Darkness&quot; and other songs.

Five Percenters were the innovators behind early hip-hop slang, including &quot;word is bond,&quot; &quot;break it down,&quot; &quot;peace,&quot; &quot;droppin&#x27; science,&quot; and &quot;represent.&quot; Many MCs employ the technique and terminology of the Supreme Alphabet to create acrostics, acronyms and backronyms in their rhymes. For example, in the song &quot;Wildflower,&quot; Ghostface Killah rhymes, &quot;I&#x27;m God Cipher Divine,&quot; spelling G-O-D in the Supreme Alphabet. RZA directly rhymes the Twelve Jewels of life&#x27;s objectives on his later work with Gravediggaz, rhyming in succession: knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom, justice, equality, food, clothing, shelter, love, peace, happiness. He regularly wears an eight-pointed star pendant, with a number seven and a crescent, which can be seen on the cover of his album &quot;The World According to RZA&quot;.

Five Percenters in New York City were a visible presence at parties during hip hop&#x27;s formative years of the 1970s. Scene pioneer DJ Kool Herc recalled that while there was a heavy gang presence in attendance, the Five Percenters were there as a &quot;de facto&quot; peace-keeping element.

Other examples of hip hop and R&amp;B acts who are, or have been, associated with Five Percent teachings include Killah Priest, Digable Planets, J-Live, Nas, Erykah Badu, Queen Latifah, Planet Asia, and Guru.

<text>Blackstreet (often stylized as BLACKstreet) is an American R&amp;B group founded in 1991 by record producers Chauncey &quot;Black&quot; Hannibal, and Teddy Riley. The group released four albums with Interscope Records between 1994 and 2003. They achieved relative commercial success leading up to their 1996 single &quot;No Diggity&quot; (featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen), which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks.

==History==


In 1991 the group was formed by Riley with Chauncey &quot;Black&quot; Hannibal Joseph &quot;Street&quot; Stonestreet and Levi Little who were session singers for Bobby Brown&#x27;s third album &quot;Bobby&quot;, an album that was mostly produced by Riley who recruited them all to be background singers for the album which led them to do songs with singers,writers, &amp; producers like L.A. Reid, New Kidz On The Block, Basic Black,Abstract, Big Bub,Rodney Jerkins,Usher, Bernard Belle,Tyrone Fyffe, Wreckx-N-Effect,The Neptunes,&amp; Tammy Lucas.
They released song for the soundtrack of the Chris Rock film &quot;CB4&quot; which was their first hit called &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; in 1993 which charted at number one on the top 40 charts and number three on the billboard charts for first three weeks of the songs release. After they finish recording the first half of the album in January of 1994 , Joseph &quot;Street&quot; Stonestreet left the group due to creative differences business &amp; lifestyle disputes with Teddy Riley and was replaced by former Force One Network singer Dave Hollister in 1994. Then they re-recorded &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; for their self-titled debut, Hollister&#x27;s vocals were added on the album version of the song.
Their debut album, &quot;Blackstreet&quot;, featured the singles &quot;Booti Call&quot;, &quot;Before I Let You Go&quot; and &quot;Joy&quot;. &quot;Booti Call&quot; and &quot;Before I Let You Go&quot; were both Top 40 hits, with &quot;Before I Let You Go&quot; hitting the Top 10. In 1996, they released their second album &quot;Another Level&quot;. It was a breakthrough success due to the top single &quot;No Diggity&quot; (with Dr. Dre), which was a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1996. In 1998, Blackstreet won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

&quot;Another Level&quot; eventually went four times platinum in the United States and peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. &quot;No Diggity&quot; was later ranked at No. 91 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and MTV: 100 Greatest Pop Songs. &quot;Another Level&quot; featured Mark Middleton and Eric Williams in place of Dave Hollister and Levi Little. Both Middleton and Williams were in groups prior to joining Blackstreet. Middleton was part of the short-lived Motown Records group Brik Citi. Williams was part of the trio The Flex, a group that sang on songs produced by their mentor Marley Marl. The success of &quot;Another Level&quot; landed them a guest appearance on Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The City Is Mine&quot; and they teamed with Mýa and Mase for the hit &quot;Take Me There&quot; from the &quot;Rugrats&quot; soundtrack. The success of &quot;Another Level&quot; would also land them a spot on New Edition&#x27;s 1997 Home Again reunion tour.

Blackstreet had a top ten album with &quot;Finally&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Girlfriend/Boyfriend&quot;, was a collaboration with Janet Jackson featuring Ja Rule and Eve. Riley recorded a reunion album with Guy in 2000 and subsequently began working on material for his first solo record. Riley had second thoughts about disbanding Blackstreet and patched things up with Hannibal. Middleton and Williams returned to restore the &quot;Another Level&quot; lineup, and Riley&#x27;s solo project became a Blackstreet reunion. After rumors of legal action and a preemptive countersuit, the group re-banded and released &quot;Level II&quot;.

===Later years===

After several failed attempts to keep Blackstreet together, all members eventually continued with solo careers for a time. However, in 2014, it was announced that past members Black, Little, Middleton, and Williams were back together under the Blackstreet moniker. They continue to perform with this lineup currently, and embarked on their second Australian tour in April 2015.

In 2015, Middleton and Williams were backing vocalists for Eurovision Song Contest 2015 North Macedonia entry &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; performed by Daniel Kajmakoski.

Joseph Stonestreet AKA Street died on June 25, 2018 at the age of 56.

<doc id="215908" wikidata="Q5304308" url="?curid=215908" title="Dr. Octagon">
<text>Dr. Octagon is a persona created and used by American rapper Keith Matthew Thornton, better known as Kool Keith. Thornton performed and released four studio albums under the alias. Having introduced the character in 1993 on the unreleased Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s demo &quot;Smoking Dust&quot;, Thornton&#x27;s first full-length recording as Dr. Octagon was on his 1996 debut solo album, &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot;. 

The character was murdered by Dr. Dooom on Thornton&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;First Come, First Served&quot;, and was briefly revived before once again being killed on Thornton&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Dr. Dooom 2&quot;, in response to the release of &quot;The Return of Dr. Octagon&quot;, an album largely produced without Thornton&#x27;s involvement. Kool Keith reunited with Dan the Automator and DJ Qbert to release &quot;&quot; on April 6, 2018. 

== Biography ==
Dr. Octagon is an extraterrestrial surgeon from Jupiter who uses space technology and primitive tools to perform medical procedures on his patients, some of whom die as he conducts his rounds, while others are murdered by his careless, barbaric acts. Octagon also practices as an orthopaedic gynaecologist and seduces and engages in sexual intercourse with his female patients and nurses.

His physical features include having yellow eyes, green and silver skin which also changes to blue and brown, a pink-and-white Afro, and a brain that glows yellow, black, red, green, and purple. Octagon specifies a few of the services he offers, such as treatment of chimpanzee acne and moosebumps, rectal rebuilding surgery, and relocating of saliva glands.

According to Kool Keith&#x27;s &quot;R.I.P. Dr. Octagon&quot;, Dr. Dooom stabbed Dr. Octagon over 17 times after he would come back to life from being drowned under water. Multiple music critics and record producers made attempts to keep him alive, but Dooom returned to finally kill Octagon by electrocuting him with an electric razor. However, Kool Keith has continued to make appearances as Dr. Octagon.

== History ==
The earliest instance of Thornton&#x27;s Dr. Octagon character appears on the unreleased Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s demo &quot;Smoking Dust&quot;, recorded in 1993 and included in the 1994 compilation album The Basement Tapes 1984–1990.

Thornton and KutMasta Kurt recorded two songs under the alias Dr. Octagon, &quot;Dr. Octagon&quot; and &quot;Technical Difficulties.&quot; Thornton mailed the songs to radio stations as a teaser, as well as giving copies to several DJs, as well as producer Dan &quot;The Automator&quot; Nakamura, resulting in the production of &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot;.

The album was recorded in Automator&#x27;s studio in the basement of his parents&#x27; San Francisco home. &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot; featured the work of turntablist DJ Qbert and additional production by KutMasta Kurt. An instrumental version of the album was released under the title &quot;Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats)&quot;. KutMasta Kurt later pursued legal action against Automator because Kurt&#x27;s demos had initiated the project. Kurt told the AV Club, “I got the whole [Dr. Octagon] thing started and really got nothing directly out of it. [Automator] ran with it, but he never gave credit to the person who threw the ball. At the end of the day, I actually had to sue the guy.&quot;

The album examines the impersonal, delusional and authoritarian aspects of institutions and bureaucracies using the general hospital and psych ward as main metaphor. The hyper-love of new technologies is also a theme. 

In promotion of the album, Thornton toured under the Dr. Octagon billing. These performances featured a full live band, an on-stage breakdancer and appearances by Invisibl Skratch Piklz. Nakamura has referred to Dr. Octagon as a three-person group rather than an alias of Thornton, and these claims were reported by the press.

Thornton later expressed some frustration with the &quot;Dr. Octagon&quot; nickname, saying, &quot;Octagon wasn&#x27;t my life...I&#x27;ve done a lot of things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great? I think people stuck me with something.&quot;

In 2002, Thornton announced &quot;The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon&quot;, a proposed sequel to &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot;, that would reintroduce the character.
Los Angeles-based producer Fanatik J was chosen to create the music for the album. Thornton himself took part in the production of early material for the project, playing bass, guitar, and keyboards on many of the tracks.

After shopping around demos for the proposed album, Thornton signed a contract with CMH Records to release the album.
On July 23, 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that a new Dr. Octagon album would be released in February 2003. As production on the album was underway, Thornton had a falling out with Fanatik J over contract rights, and the One-Watt Sun production team was hired to create the album&#x27;s music. After completing three vocal tracks with the label, based upon rough sonic themes created by the production team, Thornton had a falling out with the label, and gave the label recordings he had made two years previously, consisting of Thornton rapping and goofing off, in order to complete his contract. The resulting album, &quot;The Return of Dr. Octagon&quot;, was largely produced without Thornton&#x27;s involvement, and did not resemble the direction Thornton had initially intended for the album.

Promotional materials, including music videos, were produced without Thornton&#x27;s involvement. Thornton states that he was &quot;shocked&quot; by the label&#x27;s misrepresentation. Following the release of the album, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not promote the album. &quot;Dr. Dooom 2&quot;, Thornton&#x27;s 2008 follow-up to &quot;First Come, First Served&quot;, was produced in response to &quot;The Return of Dr. Octagon&quot;.

In 2013, Dr. Octagon made a guest appearance on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs song &quot;Buried Alive&quot;, which was featured on their album &quot;Mosquito&quot;.

Once again performing as Dr. Octagon, Kool Keith reunited with Dan The Automator and DJ Qbert to release &quot;&quot; on Bulk Recordings. The album was released on streaming services on April 6, 2018, with the physical release scheduled for Record Store Day, April 21, 2018. The Record Store Day release includes both vinyl and CD copies. Using his Deltron persona, Del the Funky Homosapien guests on &quot;3030 Meets the Doc, Pt. 1&quot;. NPR offered a first look at the album on March 29, 2018. 2020&#x27;s &quot;Space Goretex&quot; features Dr. Octagon and two of Thornton&#x27;s other personas, Dr. Dooom and Black Elvis.

<doc id="215909" wikidata="Q676081" url="?curid=215909" title="Electricity market">
<text>An electricity market is a system that enables the exchange of electrical energy, through an electrical grid. Historically, electricity has been primarily sold by companies that operate electric generators, and purchased by consumers or electricity retailers.

The electric power industry began in the late 19th century in the United States and United Kingdom. Throughout the 20th century, and up to the present, there have been deep changes in the economic management of electricity. Changes have occurred across different regions and countries, for many reasons, ranging from technological advances (on supply and demand sides) to politics and ideology.

Around the turn of the 21st century, several countries restructured their electric power industries, replacing the vertically integrated and tightly regulated &quot;traditional&quot; electricity market with market mechanisms for electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and retailing. The traditional and competitive market approaches loosely correspond to two visions of industry: the deregulation was transforming electricity from a public service (like sewerage) into a tradable good (like crude oil). As of 2020s, the traditional markets are still common in some regions, including large parts of the United States and Canada.

In recent years, governments have reformed electricity markets to improve management of variable renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

== Services ==
The structure of an electricity market is quite complex. Markets often include mechanisms to manage a variety of relevant services alongside energy. Services may include:

* on the supply side, a wholesale energy market (all of these use offer caps in some form)
* on the demand side, a retail energy market

A simple &quot;energy-only&quot; wholesale electricity market would only facilitate the sale of energy, without regard for other services that may support the system, and experienced problems once implemented alone. To account for this, the electricity market structure typically includes:

* ancillary services not directly related to producing electricity. These would not generate income in the &quot;energy-only&quot; model, but are essential for overall operation of the system (frequency control market, voltage control and reactive power management, inertial response and others)
* capacity market or some other mechanism providing an income stream necessary to build and maintain additional generation units (&quot;reserves&quot;) for the worst-case scenario. On a typical day, these units are never called upon (not &quot;dispatched&quot;) and thus would not produce revenue in an &quot;energy only&quot; market.
* cost-based market with audited costs replacing producers&#x27; bids in places where the local market power is a concern (e.g., in some parts of the US and entire hydropower-rich countries of Latin America). Due to a lack of competition, electricity networks are subject to price regulation in Australia.

The competitive retail electricity markets were able to maintain their simple structure.

In addition, for most major operators, there are markets for transmission rights and electricity derivatives such as electricity futures and options, which are actively traded.

The market externality of greenhouse gas emissions is sometimes dealt with by carbon pricing.

== Economic theory ==
Electricity market is characterized by unique features that are atypical in the markets for commodities or consumption goods.

Although few somewhat similar markets exist (for example, airplane tickets and hotel rooms, like electricity, cannot be stored and the demand for them varies by season), the magnitude of peak pricing (peak price can be 100 times higher than an off-peak one) sets the electricity market apart (the summer price for a beachfront hotel room can be 3–4 times higher than the off-season one), the hotel/airline markets can also use retail price discrimination, unavailable in the wholesale electricity market. The peculiarities of the electricity market make it fundamentally incomplete.

=== Generation ===
Electricity is typically available on demand. In order to achieve this, the supply must match the demand very closely at any time despite the continuous variations of both (so called grid balancing). Frequently, the only safety margins are the ones provided by the kinetic energy of the physically rotating machinery (synchronous generators and turbines). If there is a mismatch between supply and demand the generators absorb extra energy by speeding up or produce more power by slowing down causing the utility frequency (either 50 or 60 hertz) to increase or decrease. However, the frequency cannot deviate too much from the target: many units of the electrical equipment can be destroyed by the out-of-bounds frequency and thus will automatically disconnect from the grid to protect themselves, potentially triggering a blackout.

There are many other physical and economic constraints affecting the electricity network and the market, with some creating non-convexity:
* a typical consumer is not aware of the current system frequency and pays a fixed price for a unit of energy that does not depend on the balance between supply and demand, and thus can suddenly increase or decrease the consumption;
* variable renewable energy sources are intermittent due to the reliance on the weather and can ramp up or down literally from one minute to another;
* the fossil-fuel and nuclear plants have restrictions on the ramping speed: from 5–30 minutes in the gas-fired plants to hours in the coal-fired generation, and even longer for the nuclear ones;
* many fossil-fuel plants cannot be ramped down below 20–60% of the nameplate capacity;
* due to high cost of the start-up, the production cost of electricity might differ from the marginal cost in some time intervals thus forcing the providers to bid above the marginal cost.

=== Networks ===
Electricity networks are natural monopolies, because it is not feasible to build multiple networks competing against one another. In order to address this, many electricity networks are regulated to address the risk of price gouging. The two main types of network price regulation are:

* Cost of service regulation: prices are based on the actual cost of operating the network
* Incentive regulation: prices are capped based on a prior estimate of costs. The difference between the actual and estimated costs deliver a return or loss to the network operator.

The design of transmission network limits the amount of electricity that can be transmitted from one tighly-coupled area (&quot;node&quot;) to another, so a generator in one node might be unable to service a load in another node (due to &quot;transmission congestion&quot;), potentially creating fragments of the market that have to be served with local generation (&quot;load pockets&quot;).

== History ==

=== Traditional industries ===
After its first few years of existence, the electricity supply industry was regulated by the various levels of government. By the 1950s, a wide variety of arrangements had evolved with substantial differences between countries and even at the regional level, for example:
* France, Italy, the Republic of Ireland and Greece had nationwide government-owned vertically integrated company; 
* The United Kingdom had a government-owned generation and transmission (Central Electricity Generating Board), but the distribution was decentralized in 14 electricity boards;
* Germany combined a small number of regional integrated generation and transmission companies with municipal distribution;
* Japan had 10 regional vertically integrated monopolies;
* Norway&#x27;s electricity supply was mostly at the level of municipalities;
* In the US, a complex mix of companies, owned either privately or by varying levels of government, evolved, while the regulation favored municipal-level and co-op ownership. For example, Hawaii had only privately owned utilities, Nebraska only publicly owned ones, the Tennessee Valley Authority (the largest generation company) is federally owned, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is city-owned.
These diverse structures had a few unifying features: very little reliance on competitive markets, no formal wholesale markets, and customers unable to choose their suppliers.

The diversity and sheer size of the US market made the potential trade gains large enough to justify some wholesale transactions:
* large utilities were providing electricity to smaller (municipal or cooperative) ones under bilateral &quot;requirements contracts&quot;;
* &quot;coordination sales&quot; were made between the vertically integrated companies to reduce the costs, sometimes through power pools.
On the retail side, customers were charged fixed regulated prices that did not change with marginal costs, retail tariffs almost entirely relied on volumetric pricing (based on the meter readings recorded monthly), and fixed cost recovery was included into the per-kWh price.

The traditional market arrangement was designed for the state of the electric industry common pre-restructuring (and still common in some regions, including large parts of the US and Canada). Richard L. Schmalensee calls this state &quot;historical&quot; (as opposed to post-restructuring &quot;emerging&quot; one). In the historical regime almost all generation sources can be considered dispatchable (available on demand, unlike the emerging variable renewable energy).

=== Evolution of deregulated markets ===
Chile had become a pioneer in deregulation in the early 1980s (the law of 1982 had codified the changes that were started in 1979). Only few years later the new market approach to electricity was formulated in the US, popularized in the influential work by Joskow and Schmalensee, &quot;Markets for Power: An Analysis of Electrical Utility Deregulation&quot; (1983). At the same time in the UK, Energy Act of 1983 made provisions for common carriage in the electricity networks, enabling a choice of supplier for electricity boards and very large customers (analogous to &quot;wheeling&quot; in the US).

The incorporation of distributed energy resources (DERs) has inspired innovative electricity markets that emerge from a hierarchical deregulated market structure, such as local flexibility markets, with upstream aggregating entities representing multiple DERs (e.g., aggregators). Flexibility Markets refer to the markets in which Distribution System Operators (DSOs) procure services from assets linked to their distribution system, aiming to guarantee the operational safety of the distribution network. This concept is relatively new, and its design is currently a subject of active research. In this sense, different entities can act as aggregators, e.g. demand response aggregators, community managers, electricity service providers, and more, depending on the characteristics of the set of assets being represented.

== Wholesale electricity market ==
A wholesale electricity market, also power exchange or PX, (or energy exchange especially if they also trade gas) is a system enabling purchases, through bids to buy; sales, through offers to sell. Bids and offers use supply and demand principles to set the price. Long-term contracts are similar to power purchase agreements and generally considered private bi-lateral transactions between counterparties.

A wholesale electricity market exists when competing generators offer their electricity output to retailers. The retailers then re-price the electricity and take it to market. While wholesale pricing used to be the exclusive domain of large retail suppliers, increasingly markets like New England are beginning to open up to end-users. Large end-users seeking to cut out unnecessary overhead in their energy costs are beginning to recognize the advantages inherent in such a purchasing move. Consumers buying electricity directly from generators is a relatively recent phenomenon.

Buying wholesale electricity is not without its drawbacks (market uncertainty, membership costs, set up fees, collateral investment, and organization costs, as electricity would need to be bought on a daily basis), however, the larger the end user&#x27;s electrical load, the greater the benefit and incentive to make the switch.

For an economically efficient electricity wholesale market to flourish it is essential that a number of criteria are met, namely the existence of a coordinated spot market that has &quot;bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices&quot;. These criteria have been largely adopted in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.

Markets for power-related commodities required and managed by (and paid for by) market operators to ensure reliability, are considered ancillary services and include such names as spinning reserve, non-spinning reserve, operating reserves, responsive reserve, regulation up, regulation down, and installed capacity.

=== Market clearing ===
Wholesale transactions (bids and offers) in electricity are typically cleared and settled by the market operator or a special-purpose independent entity charged exclusively with that function. Market operators may or may not clear trades, but often require knowledge of the trade to maintain generation and load balance.

Markets for electricity trade net generation output for a number of intervals usually in increments of 5, 15 and 60 minutes.

Two types of auction can be used to determine which producers are dispatched:
* Double auction: the operator aggregates both the supply bids for each interval (forming a supply curve) and demand bids (demand curve). The clearing price is defined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves for each time interval. One example of this is the Nord Pool.
* Single reverse auction: the operator aggregates only the supply bids, and dispatches the cheapest combination of options.

To determine payments, the clearing can use one of two arrangements:
* pay-as-bid (PAB) where each successful bidder is paid the price stated in their bid. This arrangement is not common, but notable cases include the UK and the Nord Pool&#x27;s intra-day market. 
* pay-as-clear: also known as &quot;uniform pricing&quot;, or &quot;marginal pricing system (MPS&quot;). All participants are paid the price of the highest successful bid (clearing price). This system is commonly used by the electricity markets.

In PAB, strategic bidding can lead producers to bid much higher than their true cost, because they will be dispatched as long as their bid is below the clearing price.

In the absence of collusion, it is expected that MPS incentivizes producers to bid close to their short run marginal cost to avoid the risk of missing out altogether. MPS is also more transparent, as the new bidder already knows the market price and can estimate the profitability with his marginal cost, to do well with the PAB, the bidder needs information about other bids, too. Due to higher risks of the PAB, it gives an extra advantage to the large players that are better equipped to estimate the market and take the risk (for example, by gambling with a high bid for some of their units). However, MPS results in producers being paid more than their bidding prices by design, leading to calls to replace it with PAB despite the incentive for strategic bidding.

=== Centralized and decentralized markets ===
To handle all the constraints while keeping the system in balance, a central agency, the transmission system operator (TSO), is required to coordinate the unit commitment and economic dispatch. If the frequency falls outside a predetermined range the system operator will act to add or remove either generation or load.

Unlike the real-time decisions that are necessarily centralized, the electricity market itself can be centralized or decentralized. In the centralized market the TSO decides which plant should run and how much is it supposed to produce way before the delivery (during the &quot;spot market&quot; phase, or day-ahead operation). In a decentralized market the producer only commits to the delivery of electricity, but the means to do that are left to the producer itself (for example, it can enter the agreement with another producer to provide the actual energy). Centralized markets make it easier to accommodate non-convexities, while the decentralized allow intra-day trading to correct the possibly suboptimal decisions made day-ahead, for example, accommodating improved weather forecasts for renewables. Due to the difference in the grid construction (US had weaker transmission networks), the design of wholesale markets in the US and Europe had diverged, even though initially the US was followed the European (decentralized) example.

To accommodate the transmission network constraints centralized markets typically use locational marginal pricing (LMP) where each node has its own local market price (thus another name for the practice, nodal pricing). Political considerations sometimes make it unpalatable to force consumers in the same territory, but connected to different nodes, to pay different prices for electricity, so a modified generator nodal pricing (GNP) model is used: the generators are still being paid the nodal prices, while the load serving entities are charging the end users prices that are averaged over the territory. Many decentralized markets do not use the LMP and have a price established over a geographic area (&quot;zone&quot;, thus the name zonal pricing) or a &quot;region&quot; (&quot;regional pricing&quot;, the term is used primarily for very large zones of the National Electricity Market of Australia, where five regions cover the continent).

In the beginning of 2020s there was no clear preference for any of the two market designs, for example, the North American markets went through centralization, while the European ones moved in the opposite direction: 
=== Centralized market ===
A transmission system operator in a centralized electricity market obtains the cost information (usually three components: start-up costs, no-load costs, marginal production costs) for each unit of generation (&quot;unit-based bidding&quot;) and makes all the decisions in the day-ahead and real-time (system redispatch) markets. This approach allows the operator to take into consideration the details of the configuration of the transmission system. The centralized market normally uses the LMP, and the dispatch goal is minimizing the total cost in each node (which in a large network count in hundreds or even thousands). The centralized markets use some procedures resembling the vertically integrated electric utilities of the era before the deregulation, so the centralized markets are also called &quot;integrated electricity markets&quot;.

Due to the centralized and detailed nature of the day-ahead dispatch, it stays feasible and cost-efficient at the time of delivery, unless some unexpected adverse events occur. Early decisions help to efficiently schedule the plants with the long ramp-up times.

The drawbacks of the centralized design with LMP are:
* politically, it proved hard to justify higher electricity pricing for customers in some locations. In the US the solution was found in the form of GNP;
* simplified bidding does not allow to properly capture the cost structure of a more complicated plants, like a combined cycle gas turbine or a hydropower cascade;
* generation companies have an incentive to overstate their start-up costs (to capture more make-whole payments, see below);
* absence of the intra-day market makes integration of the renewables harder;
* the integrated markets are very computation-intensive, this complexity makes them opaque to traders and hard to scale;
* the unchecked power of the transmission system operator makes it harder for the regulator to handle.

Price of a unit of electricity with LMP is based on the marginal cost, so the start-up and no-load costs are not included. Centralized markets therefore typically pay a compensation for these costs to the producer (so called &quot;make-whole&quot; or &quot;uplift payments&quot;), financed in some way by the market participants (and, ultimately, the consumers).

Inflexibility of the centralized market manifests itself in two ways:
* once set at the day-ahead market, the contract usually cannot be changed (some markets allow for an hour-ahead correction), so unexpected adverse events have to be accommodated in the real-time and thus in suboptimal way, hurting producers with long ramp-up times, complex cost structures, wind power generation;
* new technology (energy storage, demand response) with new cost structures require time and effort to accommodate.

Market clearing algorithms are complex (some are NP-complete) and have to be executed in limited time (5–60 minutes). The results are thus not necessarily optimal, are hard to replicate independently, and require the market participants to trust the operator (due to the complexity sometimes a decision by the algorithm to accept or reject the bid appears entirely arbitrary to the bidder).

If the transmission system operator owns the actual transmission network, it would be incentivized to profit by increasing the congestion rents. Thus in the US the operator typically does not own any capacity and is frequently called an independent system operator (ISO).

==== Cost-based market ====
The higher degree of centralization of the market involves the direct cost calculations by the market operator (producers no longer submit bids). Despite the obvious problem with generation companies incentivized to inflate their costs (this can be hidden through transactions with affiliated companies), this cost-based electricity market arrangement eliminates the market power of the providers and is used in situation when an abuse of market power is possible (e. g., Chile with its preponderance of hydro power, in the US when the local market power is sufficiently high, some European markets). A less-obvious issue is the tendency of market participants under these conditions to concentrate on investments in the peaker plants to the detriment of the baseload power. One of the advantages of the cost-based market is the relatively low cost to set it up. The cost-based approach is popular in Latin America: in addition to Chile, it is used in Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, and countries in Central America.

A system operator performs an audit of parameters of each generator unit (including heat rate, minimum load, ramping speed, etc.) and estimates the direct marginal costs of its operation. Based on this information, an hour-by-hour dispatch schedule is put in place to minimize the total direct cost. In the process, the hourly shadow prices are obtained for each node that might be used to settle the market sales.

=== Decentralized market ===
Decentralized markets allow the generation companies to choose their own way to provide energy for their day-ahead bid (that specifies price and location). The provider can use any unit at its disposal (so called &quot;portfolio-based bidding&quot;) or even pay another company to deliver the energy. The market still has the central operator that exclusively controls the system in real-time, but with significantly diminished powers to intervene ahead of delivery (frequently just the ability to schedule the transmission network for day-ahead operation). This arrangement makes operator&#x27;s ownership of the transmission capacity less of an issue, and European countries, with the exception of UK, permit it (following the independent transmission system operator or ITSO model).

While some operators in Europe are involved in structuring the day-ahead and intra-day markets, the other ones are not. For example, the UK market after the New Electricity Trading Arrangements in UK and the market in New Zealand let the markets sort out all the frictions before real-time. This reliance on financial instruments leads to the additional names for the decentralized markets: exchange-based, unbundled, bilateral.

=== Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices ===

The system price in the day-ahead market is, in principle, determined by matching offers from generators to bids from consumers at each node to develop a classic supply and demand equilibrium price, usually on an hourly interval, and is calculated separately for subregions in which the system operator&#x27;s load flow model indicates that constraints will bind transmission imports.

The theoretical prices of electricity at each node on the network is a calculated &quot;shadow price&quot;, in which it is assumed that one additional kilowatt-hour is demanded at the node in question, and the hypothetical incremental cost to the system that would result from the optimized redispatch of available units establishes the hypothetical production cost of the hypothetical kilowatt-hour. This is known as locational marginal pricing (LMP) or nodal pricing and is used in some deregulated markets, most notably in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), PJM Interconnection, ERCOT, New York, and ISO New England markets in the United States, New Zealand, and in Singapore.

In practice, the LMP algorithm described above is run, incorporating a security-constrained (defined below), least-cost dispatch calculation with supply based on the generators that submitted offers in the day-ahead market, and demand based on bids from load-serving entities draining supplies at the nodes in question.

Due to various non-convexities present in wholesale electricity markets, in the form of economies of scale, start-up and/or shut-down costs, avoidable costs, indivisibilities, minimum supply requirements, etc., some suppliers may incur losses under LMP, e.g., because they may fail to recover their fixed cost through commodity payments only. To address this problem, various pricing schemes that lift the price above marginal cost and/or provide side-payments (uplifts) have been proposed. Liberopoulos and Andrianesis (2016) review and compare several of these schemes on the price, uplifts, and profits that each scheme generates.

While in theory the LMP concepts are useful and not evidently subject to manipulation, in practice system operators have substantial discretion over LMP results through the ability to classify units as running in &quot;out-of-merit dispatch&quot;, which are thereby excluded from the LMP calculation. In most systems, units that are dispatched to provide reactive power to support transmission grids are declared to be &quot;out-of-merit&quot; (even though these are typically the same units that are located in constrained areas and would otherwise result in scarcity signals). System operators also normally bring units online to hold as &quot;spinning-reserve&quot; to protect against sudden outages or unexpectedly rapid ramps in demand, and declare them &quot;out-of-merit&quot;. The result is often a substantial reduction in clearing price at a time when increasing demand would otherwise result in escalating prices.

Researchers have noted that a variety of factors, including energy price caps set well below the putative scarcity value of energy, the effect of &quot;out-of-merit&quot; dispatch, the use of techniques such as voltage reductions during scarcity periods with no corresponding scarcity price signal, etc., results in a missing money problem. The consequence is that prices paid to suppliers in the &quot;market&quot; are substantially below the levels required to stimulate new entry. The markets have therefore been useful in bringing efficiencies to short-term system operations and dispatch, but have been a failure in what was advertised as a principal benefit: stimulating suitable new investment where it is needed, when it is needed.

In LMP markets, where constraints exist on a transmission network, there is a need for more expensive generation to be dispatched on the downstream side of the constraint. Prices on either side of the constraint separate giving rise to congestion pricing and constraint rentals.

A constraint can be caused when a particular branch of a network reaches its thermal limit or when a potential overload will occur due to a contingent event (e.g., failure of a generator or transformer or a line outage) on another part of the network. The latter is referred to as a &quot;security constraint&quot;. Transmission systems are operated to allow for continuity of supply even if a contingent event, like the loss of a line, were to occur. This is known as a &quot;security constrained system&quot;.

In most systems the algorithm used is a &quot;DC&quot; model rather than an &quot;AC&quot; model, so constraints and redispatch resulting from thermal limits are identified/predicted, but constraints and redispatch resulting from reactive power deficiencies are not. Some systems take marginal losses into account. The prices in the real-time market are determined by the LMP algorithm described above, balancing supply from available units. This process is carried out for each 5-minute, half-hour or hour (depending on the market) interval at each node on the transmission grid. The hypothetical redispatch calculation that determines the LMP must respect security constraints and the redispatch calculation must leave sufficient margin to maintain system stability in the event of an unplanned outage anywhere on the system. This results in a spot market with &quot;bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices&quot;.

Many established markets do not employ nodal pricing, examples being the UK, EPEX SPOT (most European countries), and Nord Pool Spot (Nordic and Baltic countries).

=== Risk management ===

Financial risk management is often a high priority for participants in deregulated electricity markets due to the substantial price and volume risks that the markets can exhibit.
A consequence of the complexity of a wholesale electricity market can be extremely high price volatility at times of peak demand and supply shortages. The particular characteristics of this price risk are highly dependent on the physical fundamentals of the market such as the mix of types of generation plant and relationship between demand and weather patterns. Price risk can be manifest by price &quot;spikes&quot; which are hard to predict and price &quot;steps&quot; when the underlying fuel or plant position changes for long periods.

Volume risk is often used to denote the phenomenon whereby electricity market participants have uncertain volumes or quantities of consumption or production. For example, a retailer is unable to accurately predict consumer demand for any particular hour more than a few days into the future and a producer is unable to predict the precise time that they will have plant outage or shortages of fuel. A compounding factor is also the common correlation between extreme price and volume events. For example, price spikes frequently occur when some producers have plant outages or when some consumers are in a period of peak consumption. The introduction of substantial amounts of intermittent power sources such as wind energy may affect market prices.

Electricity retailers, who in aggregate buy from the wholesale market, and generators who in aggregate sell to the wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and to protect themselves from volatility, they will enter into &quot;hedge contracts&quot; with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for physical delivery and contracts for differences where the parties agree a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a contract for difference, if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the &quot;strike&quot; price, the generator will refund the difference between the &quot;strike&quot; price and the actual price for that period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the actual price is less than the &quot;strike price&quot;. The actual price index is sometimes referred to as the &quot;spot&quot; or &quot;pool&quot; price, depending on the market.

Many other hedging arrangements, such as swing contracts, virtual bidding, financial transmission rights, call options and put options are traded in sophisticated electricity markets. In general they are designed to transfer financial risks between participants.

=== Price capping and cross subsidy ===
Due to high gas prices because of the 2022 Russia–European Union gas dispute, in late 2022 the EU capped non-gas power prices at 180 euros per megawatt hour and the UK is considering price capping. Fossil fuels, especially gas, may be price capped higher than renewables, with revenue above the cap subsidizing some consumers, as in Turkey. Academic study of an earlier price cap in that market concluded that it reduced welfare, and another study said that an EU-wide price cap would risk &quot;a never-ending spiral of higher import prices and higher subsidies&quot;. It has been academically argued via game theory that a cap on the price of imported Russian gas (some of which is used to generate electricity) could be beneficial, however politically this is difficult.

=== International trading ===
Electricity itself, or products made with a lot of electricity, exported to another country may be charged a carbon tariff if the exporting country has no carbon price: for example as the UK has the UK ETS it would not be charged the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism whereas Turkey has no carbon price so might be charged.

=== Possible future changes ===
Rather than the traditional merit order based on cost, when there is excess generation ramping down the plants which most damage health has been suggested. Due to the growth of renewables and the 2021–2022 global energy crisis some countries are considering changing their electricity markets. For example, some Europeans suggest decoupling electricity prices from natural gas prices.

== Retail electricity market ==
A retail electricity market exists when end-use customers can choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term used in the United States for this type of consumer choice is &#x27;energy choice&#x27;. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.

Generally, electricity retail reform follows from electricity wholesale reform. However, it is possible to have a single electricity generation company and still have retail competition. If a wholesale price can be established at a node on the transmission grid and the electricity quantities at that node can be reconciled, competition for retail customers within the distribution system beyond the node is possible. In the German market, for example, large, vertically integrated utilities compete with one another for customers on a more or less open grid.

Although market structures vary, there are some common functions that an electricity retailer has to be able to perform, or enter into a contract for, to compete effectively. Failure or incompetence in the execution of one or more of the following has led to some dramatic financial disasters:

*Billing
*Credit control
*Customer management via an efficient call centre
*Distribution use-of-system contract
*Reconciliation agreement
*&quot;Pool&quot; or &quot;spot market&quot; purchase agreement
*Hedge contracts – contracts for differences to manage &quot;spot price&quot; risk

The two main areas of weakness have been risk management and billing. In the United States in 2001, California&#x27;s flawed regulation of retail competition led to the California electricity crisis and left incumbent retailers subject to high spot prices but without the ability to hedge against these. In the UK a retailer, Independent Energy, with a large customer base went bust when it could not collect the money due from customers.

Competitive retail needs open access to distribution and transmission wires. This in turn requires that prices must be set for both these services. They must also provide appropriate returns to the owners of the wires and encourage efficient location of power plants.
There are two types of fees, the access fee and the regular fee. The access fee covers the cost of having and accessing the network of wires available, or the right to use the existing transmission and distribution network. The regular fee reflects the marginal cost of transferring electricity through the existing network of wires.

New technology is available and has been piloted by the US Department of Energy that may be better suited to real-time market pricing. A potential use of event-driven SOA (service-oriented architecture) could be a virtual electricity market where home clothes dryers can bid on the price of the electricity they use in a real-time market pricing system. The real-time market price and control system could turn home electricity customers into active participants in managing the power grid and their monthly utility bills. Customers can set limits on how much they would pay for electricity to run a clothes dryer, for example, and electricity providers willing to transmit power at that price would be alerted over the grid and could sell the electricity to the dryer.

On one side, consumer devices can bid for power based on how much the owner of the device were willing to pay, set ahead of time by the consumer. On the other side, suppliers can enter bids automatically from their electricity generators, based on how much it would cost to start up and run the generators. Further, the electricity suppliers could perform real-time market analysis to determine return-on-investment for optimizing profitability or reducing end-user cost of goods. The effects of a competitive retail electricity market are mixed across states, but generally appear to lower prices in states with high participation and raise prices in states that have little customer participation.

Event-driven SOA software could allow homeowners to customize many different types of electricity devices found within their home to a desired level of comfort or economy. The event-driven software could also automatically respond to changing electricity prices, in as little as five-minute intervals. For example, to reduce the home owner&#x27;s electricity usage in peak periods (when electricity is most expensive), the software could automatically lower the target temperature of the thermostat on the central heating system (in winter) or raise the target temperature of the thermostat on the central cooling system (in summer).

== Deregulated market experience ==
Comparisons between the traditional and competitive market designs experience have provide mixed results. The US experience where the deregulated utilities operate alongside the vertically integrated ones, there is some evidence of the increased efficiencies:
* deregulated nuclear and coal-fired plants (but not the gas-fired ones) outperformed their vertically integrated peers;
* deregulated plants switched to less capital-intensive strategies of complying with the regulations;
* the wholesale trading allowed for substantially better use of the generation facilities;
* the departures of prices from costs (generation company mark-ups) had increased.
Schmalensee concludes that it is plausible that the restructuring resulted in lower wholesale prices, at least in the US and the UK. MacKay and Mercadal in a large-scale analysis of the US market between 1994 and 2016, while confirming Schmalensee&#x27;s findings on lower costs, reached the opposite conclusion on the prices: deregulated utilities realized significantly higher prices due to higher markup of the generation facilities and double extraction of the profit margin by the two vertically separated companies.

Regarding resource adequacy, the US market at the start of restructuring had excess generating capacity, confirming the expectation that regulated prices provide an incentive for the generators to overinvest. Initial hope that the revenue stream would be sufficient to continue building up the capacity did not materialize: faced with abuse of market power, all US markets introduced wholesale price caps that in many case were much lower than the value of lost load thus creating the &quot;missing money problem&quot; (capping revenue at the time of relatively infrequent shortages causes the shortage of money to build the infrastructure that is only used during these shortages); the problem of over-investment was replaced by underinvestment, dragging down the grid reliability. In response, major transfer payments for capacity were instituted (in the US in 2018 the payments were getting as high as 47% of the new unit&#x27;s revenue). EU markets followed the American lead in the 2010s. Schmalensee notes that while the process of determining the amount of compensation for new capacity in the US is in principle similar to the integrated resource planning of the traditional markets, the new version is less transparent and provides less certainty due to frequent rule changes (the traditional scheme guaranteed the cost recovery), so an efficiency improvement in this area is unlikely.

The introduction of the choice of supplier and variable pricing in the retail market was enthusiastically supported by larger consumers (businesses) that can employ the time of consumption-shifting techniques to benefit from the time-of-use pricing and have access to hedging against very high prices. Acceptance among residential customers in the US was minimal.

Many regional markets have achieved some success, and the ongoing trend continues to be towards deregulation and introduction of competition. However, in 2000/2001 major failures such as the California electricity crisis and the Enron debacle caused a slow down in the pace of change and in some regions an increase in market regulation and reduction in competition. However, this trend is widely regarded as a temporary one against the longer-term trend towards more open and competitive markets.

Notwithstanding the favorable light in which market solutions are viewed conceptually, the &quot;missing money&quot; problem has to date proved intractable. If electricity prices were to move to the levels needed to incentivize new merchant (i.e., market-based) transmission and generation, the costs to consumers would be politically difficult.

The increase in annual costs to consumers in New England alone were calculated at $3 billion during the recent FERC hearings on the NEPOOL market structure. Several mechanisms that are intended to incentivize new investment where it is most needed by offering enhanced capacity payments (but only in zones where generation is projected to be short) have been proposed for NEPOOL, PJM and NYPOOL, and go under the generic heading of &quot;locational capacity&quot; or LICAP (the PJM version is called the &quot;Reliability Pricing Model&quot;, or &quot;RPM&quot;).

==Capacity market==

In a deregulated grid some sort of incentives are necessary for market participants to build and maintain generation and transmission resources that &quot;may&quot; some day be called upon to maintain the grid balance (supporting the &quot;resource adequacy&quot;, or RA), but most of the time these resources are idled and do not produce revenue from the sale of electricity. Since &quot;energy-only markets have the potential to result in an equilibrium point for the market that is not consistent with what users and regulators want to see&quot;, all existing wholesale electricity markets rely on offer caps in some form. These caps prevent the suppliers from fully recovering their investment into the reserve capacity through the scarcity pricing, creating a missing money problem for generators. To avoid underinvestment into the generation and transmission capacity, all markets employ some kind of RA transfers.

Typical regulator requires a retailer to purchase firm capacity for 110–120% of its annual peak power. The contracts are either bilateral (between the retailers and generator owners), or are traded on a centralized capacity market (the case, e.g., for the eastern USA grid).

===Turkey===

The capacity mechanism is claimed to be a mechanism for subsiding coal in Turkey, and has been criticised by some economists, as they say it encourages strategic capacity withholding. It was designed to keep gas plants in the system. Unlike many other markets it is a hybrid system based partly on fixed costs and partly on market clearing price. Many say it is not good and should be changed, for example by using regional bidding zones because constraint management is the main problem in the market.

===United Kingdom===
The Capacity Market is a part of the British government&#x27;s Electricity Market Reform package. According to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy &quot;the Capacity Market will ensure security of electricity supply by providing a payment for reliable sources of capacity, alongside their electricity revenues, to ensure they deliver energy when needed. This will encourage the investment we need to replace older power stations and provide backup for more intermittent and inflexible low carbon generation sources&quot;.
====Auctions====
Two Capacity Market Auctions are held each year. The T-4 auction buys capacity to be delivered in four years’ time and the T-1 auction is a top-up auction held just ahead of each delivery year.
Capacity Market Auction results have been published for several years.
*2023, 7.6 GW for delivery in 2024/25, mostly gas and nuclear
*2023, 42.8 GW for delivery in 2027/28, mostly gas

====Definitions====
The National Grid &#x27;Guidance document for Capacity Market participants&#x27; provides the following definitions:
* &quot;CMU (Capacity Market Unit) – this is the Generating Unit(s) or DSR Capacity that is being prequalified and will ultimately provide Capacity should they secure a Capacity Agreement&quot;.
* &quot;A Generating CMU is a generating unit that provides electricity, is capable of being controlled independently from any other generating unit outside the CMU, is measured by 1 or more half hourly meters and has a connection capacity greater than 2MW&quot;.
* &quot;A DSR CMU is a commitment by a person to provide an amount of capacity by a method of Demand Side Response by either reducing the DSR customers import of electricity, as measured by one or more half hourly meters, exporting electricity generated by one or more permitted on site generating units or varying demand for active power in response to changing system frequency&quot;.

==Frequency control market==
Within many electricity markets, there are specialised markets for the provision of frequency control and ancillary services (FCAS). If the electricity system has supply (generation) in excess of electricity demand, at any instant, then the frequency will increase. By contrast, if there is insufficient supply of electricity to meet demand at any time then the system frequency will fall. If it falls too far, the power system will become unstable. 
Frequency control markets are in addition to, and separate from, the wholesale electricity pool market. These markets serve to incentivise the provision of frequency raise services or frequency lower services. Frequency raise involves rapid provision of extra electricity generation, so that supply and demand can be more closely matched.

<text>Alain Madelin (; born 26 March 1946) is a French politician.

== Politician ==
Madelin was minister of Industry in Prime Minister Jacques Chirac&#x27;s cabinet from 1986 to 1988, a minister of Business in Prime Minister Édouard Balladur&#x27;s cabinet from 1993 to 1995, and a minister of Economy and Finances in Prime Minister Alain Juppé&#x27;s cabinet. He resigned after only three months, citing economic policy differences with Alain Juppé.

He was a member of the National Assembly from 1978 to 2007 as representative for Ille-et-Vilaine&#x27;s fourth constituency. The district includes the town of Redon, where he was mayor from 1995 until 2000.

Madelin unsuccessfully ran in 1996 for president of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), and was defeated by François Léotard. He was elected as leader of the Parti Républicain, a part of the UDF coalition, which he renamed Démocratie Libérale. In 1998, Démocratie Libérale split from the UDF. Madelin&#x27;s obtained slightly less than 4% of the vote in the 2002 presidential election and merged his party into the UMP. After 2002, although his former supporter Jean-Pierre Raffarin became Prime minister, and as a result of the end of Démocratie Libérale, Madelin&#x27;s influence in French national politics dwindled.

As a classical liberal, he was a strong supporter of laissez-faire economics and was also a candidate in the 2002 French presidential election as the leader of the Liberal Democracy party, where he scored 3.91% on the first round. Following the election, he became a member of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).

Madelin is the French major politician the most in favor of the international policies of the United States, and supported the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Because of this, he has, in the past, generally been considered with favor by the US press.

He did not seek reelection in the 2007 elections, ending his involvement in partisan politics.

<doc id="215912" wikidata="Q178713" url="?curid=215912" title="Isao Takahata">
<text>was a Japanese director, screenwriter and producer. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he earned international critical acclaim for his work as a director of Japanese animated feature films. Born in Ujiyamada, Mie Prefecture, Takahata joined Toei Animation after graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1959. He worked as an assistant director, holding various positions over the years and collaborating with colleague Hayao Miyazaki, eventually directing his own film, &quot;The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; (1968). He continued his partnership with Miyazaki, and under Nippon Animation directed the television series &quot;Heidi, Girl of the Alps&quot; (1974), &quot;3000 Leagues in Search of Mother&quot; (1976), and &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1979). Takahata, Miyazaki and others formed Studio Ghibli in 1985, where he would direct &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988), &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; (1991), &quot;Pom Poko&quot; (1994), and &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot; (1999). His last film as director was &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot; (2013), which was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Animated Feature Film at the 87th Academy Awards.

==Life and career==
===Early career===
Takahata was born in Ujiyamada (now Ise), Mie Prefecture, Japan, on October 29, 1935, as the youngest of seven siblings and third son in the family. His father, Asajirō Takahata (1888–1984), was a junior high school principal, who became the education chief of Okayama prefecture after the war. On June 29, 1945, when Takahata was nine years old, he and his family survived a major United States air raid on Okayama City.

Takahata graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1959 with a degree in French literature. During this time at the school, he had seen the French film &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;Oiseau&quot; (&quot;The King and the Mockingbird&quot;), which led him to become interested in animation. Takahata was more interested in animation as a medium, and wanted to write and direct for animated works rather than create animations himself. A friend suggested he apply for a directing job at Toei Animation; Takahata passed their entrance exam, and was hired as an assistant director for several of Toei&#x27;s animated television shows and films—including &quot;Wolf Boy Ken&quot;, on which he was mentored by Yasuo Ōtsuka. Ōtsuka eventually asked Takahata to direct an animated feature film of his own; his directorial debut was &quot;The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; (1968). Ōtsuka served as Animation Director on the film, while another Toei employee, Hayao Miyazaki, served as key animator. Though it would later be recognized as one of the first defining works of modern Japanese animation, the film was a commercial failure, and Takahata was demoted.

Unable to further improve his standing at Toei, Takahata left the studio in 1971, along with Miyazaki and Yōichi Kotabe. Takahata and Miyazaki came up with the idea of creating an animated feature film based on the stories of Pippi Longstocking. They developed the idea along with &quot;A Production&quot;, an animated studio formed by another former Toei animator, Daikichiro Kusube (the company became Shin-Ei Animation). Takahata and Miyazaki had developed a number of storyboards and had flown out to Sweden for location shots, to meet with the books&#x27; author, Astrid Lindgren, and secure the rights for the character. However they could not reach an agreement with the rightsholders, and were forced to drop the project. Takahata and Miyazaki remained collaborators in several other animation projects through the 1970s, including taking over production of the anime series &quot;Lupin III&quot; at Ōtsuka&#x27;s request, due to its poor ratings. They also made &quot;Panda! Go, Panda!&quot; for TMS around this time, which utilized some of the designs and concepts developed for the Longstocking project.

Not long afterward, Takahata, Kotabe, and Miyazaki were approached by the studio Zuiyo Enterprise to create an animated series based on the novel &quot;Heidi&quot;, which resulted in &quot;Heidi, Girl of the Alps&quot; (this also incorporated some of their work from the Pippi Longstocking concept). The animation production section of Zuiyo was established as a subsidiary company named Zuiyo Eizo, later becoming Nippon Animation, which Takahata and Miyazaki joined. Takahata continued to work at Nippon for about a decade; his work there included a &quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot; adaptation of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; in 1979, another project which had thematic similarities with the Pippi Longstocking concept.

Around 1981, Takahata left Nippon to join Telecom Animation Film Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of Tokyo Movie Shinsha or TMS Entertainment), where he led production of an animated feature based on the manga &quot;Jarinko Chie&quot;, and a subsequent television spinoff. Around 1982, Telecom came up with the idea of an animated feature film &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; which adapted the &quot;Little Nemo&quot; comic, which was to feature joint direction between Japanese and American animation techniques. While both Takahata and Miyazaki were originally involved, they opted to leave the project and Telecom itself due to discord between the Japanese and American project directions.

===Studio Ghibli===
Concurrent to these events, Miyazaki had made his own directorial debut in the &quot;Lupin III&quot; feature film &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; in 1979, which was a critical success. Inspired by this, Miyazaki then began developing his own manga, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, and directing its 1984 film adaption, which also was commercially and critically successful. Miyazaki approached Takahata with the idea of co-founding their own animation studio based on the success of &quot;Nausicaä&quot;; Studio Ghibli was subsequently formed in 1985 by Miyazaki, Takahata, and Miyazaki&#x27;s collaborators Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma.

The studio primarily released animated feature films that were directed by Miyazaki, with Takahata serving as producer or in other roles. Takahata did direct several Studio Ghibli films as well. His first, &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, released in 1988, was based on the semi-autobiographical short story of the same name written by Akiyuki Nosaka, but Takahata was also partially inspired by his own experiences from the bombing of Okayama City. &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; received critical acclaim for its emotional impact and anti-war themes, and is considered the film that established the international esteem of Studio Ghibli. Other Ghibli films which Takahata served as director included &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; (1991), &quot;Pom Poko&quot; (1994) and &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot; (1999). In addition to directing and producing, he also served as music director for Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1989).

=== Later life and death ===
Takahata announced that he would direct one last film for Studio Ghibli, &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot; (&quot;Kaguya-hime no Monogatari&quot;, 2013), around the same time that Miyazaki also announced his plans to retire from the studio. &quot;Someday we should make a Japanese Heidi&quot;, Takahata and Miyazaki had both agreed after making Heidi noting its similarities to the &quot;Princess Kaguya&quot; story. Heidi&#x27;s carefree depiction, Takahata had told one journalist, &quot;stems from my ideal image of what a child should be like&quot;. When the film arrived in Western markets the following year, it was nominated for the Best Animated Feature at the 87th Academy Awards. Takahata continued to work at Ghibli, serving as an artistic producer for &quot;The Red Turtle&quot; (2016), the first feature film of Dutch animator and director Michaël Dudok de Wit in collaboration with Ghibli. The film premiered in September 2016.

Takahata had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and died on April 5, 2018, at a hospital in Tokyo, at the age of 82. On May 15, 2018, a farewell ceremony for Takahata was held at the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Hayao Miyazaki publicly spoke for the first time about Takahata&#x27;s death, saying &quot;I was convinced that Paku-san [Takahata&#x27;s nickname] would live to be 95 years old, but he unfortunately passed away. It makes me think my time is also limited...Thank you, Paku-san.&quot;

==Influences and style==
Takahata was influenced by the works of Paul Grimault, a French animator, as well as French New Wave directors, including Jean-Luc Godard. He was also influenced by French-born Canadian director Frédéric Back, including his works &quot;Crac&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Planted Trees&quot;. He felt it was important to be able to achieve &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, the illusion of three dimensions using a two-dimensional medium.

Takahata&#x27;s films had a major influence on Hayao Miyazaki, prompting animator Yasuo Ōtsuka to suggest that Miyazaki learned his sense of social responsibility from Takahata and that without him, Miyazaki would probably have been interested in comic book material. As with Miyazaki, Takahata and Michel Ocelot were great admirers of each other&#x27;s work. Ocelot names Takahata&#x27;s &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; and &quot;Pom Poko&quot; among his favorite films.

<doc id="215913" wikidata="Q313492" url="?curid=215913" title="Meriwether Lewis">
<text>Meriwether Lewis (August 18, 1774 – October 11, 1809) was an American explorer, soldier, politician, and public administrator, best known for his role as the leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery, with William Clark.
Their mission was to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase, establish trade with, and sovereignty over the natives near the Missouri River, and claim the Pacific Northwest and Oregon Country for the United States before European nations. They also collected scientific data and information on indigenous nations. President Thomas Jefferson appointed him Governor of Upper Louisiana in 1806. He died in 1809 of gunshot wounds, in what was either a murder or suicide.

==Life and work==

Meriwether Lewis was born August 18, 1774, on Locust Hill Plantation in Albemarle County, Colony of Virginia, in the present-day community of Ivy. He was the son of William Lewis, of Welsh ancestry, and Lucy Meriwether, of English ancestry. After his father died of pneumonia in November 1779, he moved with his mother and stepfather Captain John Marks to Georgia. They settled along the Broad River in the Goosepond Community within the Broad River Valley in Wilkes County (now Oglethorpe County). He was also the great-great-grandson of David Crawford, a prominent Virginia Burgess and militia colonel.

Lewis had no formal education until he was 13 years old, but during his time in Georgia, he enhanced his skills as a hunter and outdoorsman. He would often venture out in the middle of the night in the dead of winter with only his dog to go hunting. Even at an early age, he was interested in natural history, which would develop into a lifelong passion. His mother taught him how to gather wild herbs for medicinal purposes.

In the Broad River Valley, Lewis first dealt with Native Americans. This was the traditional territory of the Cherokee, who resented encroachment by the colonists. Lewis seems to have been a champion for them among his own people. While in Georgia, he met Eric Parker, who encouraged him to travel. At age 13, Lewis was sent back to Virginia for education by private tutors. His father&#x27;s older brother Nicholas Lewis became his guardian. 

He joined the Virginia militia, and in 1794 he was sent as part of a detachment that was involved in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion. In 1795, Lewis joined the United States Army, commissioned as an ensign—an army rank later abolished and equivalent to a modern-day second lieutenant. By 1800, he had risen to captain and ended his service there in 1801. Among his commanding officers was William Clark, who would later become his companion in the Corps of Discovery.

On April 1, 1801, Lewis was appointed as Secretary to the President by President Thomas Jefferson, whom he knew through Virginia society in Albemarle County. Lewis resided in the presidential mansion and frequently conversed with various prominent figures in politics, the arts and other circles. He compiled information on the personnel and politics of the United States Army, which had seen an influx of Federalist officers as a result of &quot;midnight appointments&quot; made by outgoing president John Adams in 1801. Meriwether was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1802.

When Jefferson began to plan for an expedition across the continent, he chose Lewis to lead the expedition. Meriwether Lewis recruited Clark, then aged 33, to share command of the expedition.

===Expedition west===

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Thomas Jefferson wanted to get an accurate sense of the new land and its resources. The president also hoped to find a &quot;direct and practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce with Asia&quot;. In addition, Jefferson placed special importance on declaring U.S. sovereignty over the Native Americans along the Missouri River.

The two-year exploration by Lewis and Clark was the first transcontinental expedition to the Pacific Coast by the United States. They reached the Pacific twelve years after Sir Alexander Mackenzie did overland in Canada. When they left Fort Mandan in April 1805 they were accompanied by the 16-year-old Shoshone woman, Sacagawea, the wife of the French-Canadian fur trader, Toussaint Charbonneau. The Corps of Discovery made contact with many Native Americans in the Trans-Mississippi West and found them accustomed to dealing with European traders and already connected to global markets.

After crossing the Rocky Mountains, the expedition reached the Oregon Country (which was disputed land beyond the Louisiana Purchase) and the Pacific Ocean in November 1805. They returned in 1806, bringing with them an immense amount of information about the region as well as numerous plant and animal specimens. They demonstrated the possibility of overland travel to the Pacific Coast. The success of their journey helped to strengthen the American concept of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; – the idea that the United States was destined to reach across North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

===Return and gubernatorial duties===
After returning from the expedition, Lewis received a reward of of land. He also initially made arrangements to publish the Corps of Discovery journals, but had difficulty completing his writing. In 1807, Jefferson appointed him governor of the Louisiana Territory; he settled in St. Louis.

Lewis&#x27;s record as an administrator is mixed. He published the first laws in the Upper Louisiana Territory, established roads, and furthered Jefferson&#x27;s mission as a strong proponent of the fur trade. He negotiated peace among several quarreling Indian tribes. His duty to enforce Indian treaties was to protect the western Indian lands from encroachment, which was opposed by the rush of settlers looking to open new lands for settlements. However, due to his quarreling with local political leaders, controversy over his approvals of trading licenses, land grant politics, and Indian depredations, some historians have argued that Lewis was a poor administrator.

That view has been reconsidered in recent biographies. Lewis&#x27;s primary quarrels were with his territorial secretary Frederick Bates. Bates was accused of undermining Lewis and seeking his dismissal and appointment as governor. Because of the slow-moving mail system, former president Jefferson and Lewis&#x27;s superiors in Washington got the impression that Lewis did not adequately keep in touch with them.

Bates wrote letters to Lewis&#x27;s superiors accusing Lewis of profiting from a mission to return a Mandan chief to his tribe. Because of Bates&#x27; accusation, the War Department refused to reimburse Lewis for a large sum he personally advanced for the mission. When Lewis&#x27;s creditors heard that Lewis would not be reimbursed for the expenses, they called in Lewis&#x27;s notes, forcing him to liquidate his assets, including land he was granted for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. One of the primary reasons Lewis set out for Washington on this final trip was to clear up questions raised by Bates and to seek reimbursement of the money he had advanced for the territorial government.

The U.S. government finally reimbursed the expenses to Lewis&#x27;s estate two years after his death. Bates eventually became governor of Missouri. However, some historians have speculated that Lewis abused alcohol or opiates based upon an account attributed to Gilbert C. Russell at Fort Pickering on Lewis&#x27;s final journey, Others have argued that Bates never alleged that Lewis suffered from such addictions and that Bates certainly would have used them against Lewis if Lewis suffered from those conditions.

===Freemasonry===
&quot;See List of Notable Freemasons&quot;

Lewis was a Freemason, initiated, passed, and raised in the &quot;Door To Virtue Lodge No. 44&quot; in Albemarle, Virginia, between 1796 and 1797. On August 2, 1808, Lewis and several of his acquaintances submitted a petition to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania requesting dispensation to establish a lodge in St. Louis. Lewis was nominated and recommended to serve as the first Master of the proposed Lodge, which was warranted as Lodge No. 111 on September 16, 1808.

===Lewis and slavery===
Although Lewis attempted to supervise enslaved people while running his mother&#x27;s plantation before the westward expedition, he left that post and had no valet during the expedition, unlike William Clark, who brought his slave York. Lewis made assignments to York but allowed Clark to supervise him; Lewis also granted York and Sacagawea votes during expedition meetings. Later, Lewis hired a free African-American man as his valet, John Pernia. Pernia accompanied Lewis during his final journey, although his wages were considerably in arrears. After Lewis&#x27;s death, Pernia continued to Monticello and asked Jefferson to pay the $240 owed, but he was refused. Pernia later committed suicide.

==Death==

On September 3, 1809, Lewis set out for Washington, D.C.. He hoped to resolve issues regarding the denied payment of drafts he had drawn against the War Department while serving as governor of the Upper Louisiana Territory, leaving him in potentially ruinous debt. Lewis carried his journals with him for delivery to his publisher. He intended to travel to Washington by ship from New Orleans, but changed his plans while floating down the Mississippi River from St. Louis. He disembarked and decided instead to make an overland journey via the Natchez Trace and then east to Washington (the Natchez Trace was the old pioneer road between Natchez, Mississippi, and Nashville, Tennessee). Robbers preyed on travelers on that road and sometimes killed their victims. Lewis had written his will before his journey and also attempted suicide on this journey, but was restrained.

===Circumstances===

According to a lost letter from October 19, 1809, to Thomas Jefferson, Lewis stopped at an inn on the Natchez Trace called Grinder&#x27;s Stand, about southwest of Nashville on October 10. After dinner, he retired to his one-room cabin. In the predawn hours of October 11, the innkeeper&#x27;s wife, Priscilla Griner, heard gunshots. Servants found Lewis badly injured from multiple gunshot wounds, one each to the head and gut. He bled out on his buffalo hide robe and died shortly after sunrise. The Nashville &quot;Democratic Clarion&quot; published the account, which newspapers across the country repeated and embellished. The Nashville newspaper also reported that Lewis&#x27;s throat was cut. Money that Lewis had borrowed from Major Gilbert Russell at Fort Pickering to complete the journey was missing.

While Lewis&#x27;s friend Thomas Jefferson and some modern historians have generally accepted Lewis&#x27;s death as a suicide, debate continues, as discussed below. No one reported seeing Lewis shoot himself. Three inconsistent, somewhat contemporary accounts are attributed to Mrs. Griner, who left no written account or testimony. Some thus believe her testimony was fabricated, while others point to it as proof of suicide. Mrs. Griner claimed Lewis acted strangely the night before his death: standing and pacing during dinner and talking to himself in the way one would speak to a lawyer, with face flushed as if it had come on him in a fit. She continued to hear him talking to himself after he retired, and then at some point in the night, she heard multiple gunshots, a scuffle, and someone calling for help.

She claimed to see Lewis through the slit in the door crawling back to his room. She did not explain why she stopped investigating then or decided to send her children to look for his servants the following day. Another account claims the servants found him in the cabin, wounded and bloody, with part of his skull gone, where he lived for several hours. In her last account, three men followed him up the Natchez Trace, where he pulled his pistols and challenged them to a duel. She heard voices and gunfire in his cabin at about 1:00 am. She then found it empty with a large amount of gunpowder on the floor.

Lewis&#x27;s relatives maintained it was murder. A coroner&#x27;s inquest held immediately after his death, as provided by local law, did not charge anyone with any crime. The jury foreman kept a pocket diary of the proceedings, which disappeared in the early 1900s. When William Clark and Thomas Jefferson were informed of Lewis&#x27;s death, both accepted the conclusion of suicide. Based on their positions and the lost Lewis letter of mid-September 1809, historian Stephen Ambrose dismissed the murder theory as &quot;not convincing&quot;.

===Later analysis===
The only doctor to examine Lewis&#x27;s body did not do so until 40 years later, in 1848. The Tennessee State Commission, including Samuel B. Moore, charged with locating Lewis&#x27;s grave and erecting a monument over it, opened Lewis&#x27;s grave. The commission wrote in its official report that though the impression had long prevailed that Lewis died by his own hand, &quot;it seems to be more probable that he died by the hands of an assassin.&quot; In the book &quot;The History of the Lewis and Clark Expedition&quot;, first printed in 1893, the editor Elliott Coues expressed doubt about Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s conclusion that Lewis committed suicide, despite including the former president&#x27;s &quot;Memoir of Meriwether Lewis&quot; in his book.

From 1993 to 2010, about 200 of Lewis&#x27;s kin (through his sister Jane, as he had no children) sought to have the body exhumed for forensic analysis, to try to determine whether his death was a suicide or murder. A Tennessee coroner&#x27;s jury in 1996 recommended exhumation. Since his gravesite is in a national monument, the National Park Service must approve. The agency refused the request in 1998, citing possible disturbance to the bodies of more than 100 pioneers buried nearby. In 2008, the Department of the Interior approved the exhumation, but rescinded that decision in 2010, stating that the decision is final. It is nonetheless improving the gravesite and visitor facility.

Historian Paul Russell Cutright wrote a detailed rebuttal of the murder/robbery theory, concluding that it &quot;lacks legs to stand on&quot;. He stressed Lewis&#x27;s debts, heavy drinking, possible morphine and opium use, failure to prepare the expedition&#x27;s journals for publication, repeated failure to find a wife, and the deterioration of his friendship with Thomas Jefferson. This refutation was countered by Dr. Eldon G. Chuinard, (physician), who argued for the murder hypothesis on the basis that Lewis&#x27;s reported wounds were inconsistent with his reported two-hour survival after the shooting. This particular medical theory as well as other medical/psychological theories often cited by numerous Lewis authors (syphilis, malaria, alcohol abuse, mercury poisoning, PTSD, depression, et al.), have been explored by Dr. David J. Peck (physician) and Marti Peck, Ph.D. (psychologist) in their book &quot;So Hard to Die&quot;. Leading Lewis scholars Donald Jackson, Jay H. Buckley, Clay S. Jenkinson, and others have stated that, regardless of their leanings or beliefs, the facts of his death are not known, there are no eyewitnesses, and the reliability of reports of those in the place or vicinity cannot be considered certain. Author Peter Stark believes that post-traumatic stress disorder may have been a contributor to Meriwether Lewis&#x27;s condition after spending months traversing hostile Indian territory, particularly because travelers coming afterward exhibited the same symptoms. According to research from author Thomas Danisi, Lewis&#x27;s self-inflicted gunshot wounds were not the result of murder or attempted suicide, but a combination of a severe malarial attack, a deranged state of mind, and intense pain.

==Memorials==

Lewis was buried near his place of death in present-day Hohenwald. His grave was located about 200 yards from Grinder&#x27;s Stand, alongside the Natchez Trace (that section of the 1801 Natchez Trace was built by the U.S. Army under the direction of Lewis&#x27;s mentor, Thomas Jefferson, during Lewis&#x27;s lifetime).

At first, the grave was unmarked. Alexander Wilson, an ornithologist and friend of Lewis who visited the grave in May 1810 during a trip to New Orleans to sell his drawings, wrote that he gave the innkeeper Robert Griner money to erect a fence around the grave to protect it from animals.

The State of Tennessee erected a monument over Lewis&#x27;s grave in 1848. Lemuel Kirby, a stonemason from Columbia, Tennessee, chose the design of a broken column, commonly used at the time to symbolize a life cut short.

An iron fence erected around the base of the monument was partially dismantled during the Civil War by Confederate detachments under General John Bell Hood marching from Shiloh toward Franklin; they forged the iron into horseshoes.

A September 1905 article in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot; called attention to Lewis&#x27;s abandoned and overgrown grave. A county road worker, Teen Cothran, initiated opening a road to the cemetery. A local Tennessee Meriwether Lewis Monument Committee was soon formed to push for restoring Lewis&#x27;s gravesite. In 1925, in response to the committee&#x27;s work, President Calvin Coolidge designated Lewis&#x27;s grave as the fifth National Monument in the South.

In 2009, the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation organized a commemoration for Lewis in conjunction with their 41st annual meeting from October 3–7, 2009. It included the first national memorial service at his gravesite. On October 7, 2009, near the 200th anniversary of Lewis&#x27;s death, about 2,500 people (National Park Service estimate) from more than 25 states gathered at his grave to acknowledge Lewis&#x27;s life and achievements. Speakers included William Clark&#x27;s descendant Peyton &quot;Bud&quot; Clark, Lewis&#x27;s collateral descendants Howell Bowen and Tom McSwain, and Stephanie Ambrose Tubbs (daughter of Stephen Ambrose, who wrote &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;, an award-winning book about the Lewis and Clark Expedition). A bronze bust of Lewis was dedicated at the Natchez Trace Parkway for a planned visitor center at the gravesite. The District of Columbia and governors of 20 states associated with the Lewis and Clark Trail sent flags flown over state capital buildings to be carried to Lewis&#x27;s grave by residents of the states, acknowledging the significance of Lewis&#x27;s contribution to the creation of their states.

The 2009 ceremony at Lewis&#x27;s grave was the final bicentennial event honoring the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Re-enactors from the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial participated, and official attendees included representatives from Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello. Lewis and Clark descendants and family members, along with representatives of St. Louis Lodge #1, past presidents of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, and the Daughters of the American Revolution, carried wreaths and led a formal procession to Lewis&#x27;s grave. Samples of plants that Lewis discovered on the expedition were brought from the Trail states and laid on his grave. The 101st Airborne Infantry Band and its Army chaplain represented the U.S. Army. The National Park Service announced that it would rehabilitate the site.

==Legacy==

For many years, Lewis&#x27;s legacy was overlooked, inaccurately assessed, and somewhat tarnished by his alleged suicide. Yet his contributions to science, the exploration of the Western U.S., and the lore of great world explorers, are considered incalculable.

Four years after Lewis&#x27;s death, Thomas Jefferson wrote:
&quot;Of courage undaunted, possessing a firmness &amp; perseverance of purpose which nothing but impossibilities could divert from its direction, careful as a father of those committed to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance of order &amp; discipline, intimate with the Indian character, customs &amp; principles, habituated to the hunting life, guarded by exact observation of the vegetables &amp; animals of his own country, against losing time in the description of objects already possessed, honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound understanding and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever he should report would be as certain as if seen by ourselves, with all these qualifications as if selected and implanted by nature in one body, for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprise to him.

Jefferson wrote that Lewis had a &quot;luminous and discriminating intellect&quot;. William Clark&#x27;s first son Meriwether Lewis Clark was named after Lewis; the senior Meriwether Clark passed the name on to his son, Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr.
Captain Meriwether Lewis and Lieutenant (de facto co-captain and posthumously, officially promoted to captain in advance of the bicentennial) William Clark commanded the Corps of Discovery to map the course of the Missouri River to its source and the Pacific Northwest overland and water routes to and from the mouth of the Columbia River. They were honored with a 3-cent stamp on July 24, 1954, on the 150th anniversary. The 1803 Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States. Lewis and Clark described and sketched its flora and fauna and described the native inhabitants they encountered before returning to St. Louis in 1806.

===Coins===
Both Lewis and Clark appear on the gold Lewis and Clark Exposition dollars minted for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Among the early United States commemorative coins, they were produced in 1904 and 1905 and survived in relatively small numbers.
===Postage stamps===
The Lewis and Clark Expedition was celebrated on May 14, 2004, the 200th anniversary of its outset, by depicting the two on a hilltop outlook: two companion 37-cent USPS stamps showed portraits of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. A special 32-page booklet accompanied the issue in eleven cities along the route taken by the Corps of Discovery. An image of the stamp can be found on Arago online at the link in the footnote.

===Flora and fauna===
The plant genus &quot;Lewisia&quot; (family Portulacaceae), popular in rock gardens and which includes the bitterroot (&quot;Lewisia rediviva&quot;), the state flower of Montana, is named after Lewis, as is Lewis&#x27;s woodpecker (&quot;Melanerpes lewis&quot;) and a subspecies of the cutthroat trout, the westslope cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi&quot;). Also named after him in 1999, is &quot;Lewisiopsis tweedyi&quot; which is a flowering plant and sole species in genus &quot;Lewisiopsis&quot; (in the family Montiaceae).
In 2004, the American elm cultivar &quot;Ulmus americana&quot; &#x27;Lewis &amp; Clark&#x27; (selling name ) was released by North Dakota State University Research Foundation in commemoration of the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition&#x27;s bicentenary; the tree has a resistance to Dutch elm disease.

<text>William Clark (August 1, 1770 – September 1, 1838) was an American explorer, soldier, Indian agent, and territorial governor. A native of Virginia, he grew up in pre-statehood Kentucky before later settling in what became the state of Missouri.

Along with Meriwether Lewis, Clark led the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806 across the Louisiana Purchase to the Pacific Ocean, the first major effort to explore and map much of what is now the Western United States and to assert American claims to the Pacific Northwest. Before the expedition, he served in a militia and the United States Army. Afterward, he served in a militia and as governor of the Missouri Territory. From 1822 until his death in 1838, he served as a U.S. Superintendent of Indian Affairs in St. Louis.

==Early life==
William Clark was born in Caroline County, Virginia, on August 1, 1770, the ninth of ten children of John and Ann Rogers Clark. His parents were natives of King and Queen County, and were of English and possibly Scots ancestry. The Clarks were planters in Virginia, owned several modest estates, and claimed ownership of several enslaved African Americans. They were members of the Anglican Church.

Clark did not have any formal education; like many of his contemporaries, he was tutored at home. In later years, he was self-conscious about his convoluted grammar and inconsistent spelling—he spelled &quot;Sioux&quot; 27 different ways in his journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition—and sought to have his journals corrected before publication. The spelling of American English was not standardized in Clark&#x27;s youth, but his vocabulary suggests he was well read.

Clark&#x27;s five older brothers fought in Virginia units during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), but William was too young. His oldest brother, Jonathan Clark, served as a colonel during the war, rising to the rank of brigadier general in the Virginia militia years afterward. His second-oldest brother, George Rogers Clark, rose to the rank of general, spending most of the war in Kentucky fighting against British-allied American Indians. After the war, the two oldest Clark brothers made arrangements for their parents and family to relocate to Kentucky.

William, his parents, his three sisters, and the Clark family&#x27;s slaves arrived in Kentucky in March 1785, having first traveled overland to Redstone Landing in present-day Brownsville, Pennsylvania. They completed the journey down the Ohio River by flatboat. The Clark family settled at &quot;Mulberry Hill&quot;, a plantation along Beargrass Creek near Louisville. This was William Clark&#x27;s primary home until 1803. In Kentucky, his older brother George Rogers Clark taught William wilderness survival skills.

==Military career begins==
Kentuckians fought the Northwest Indian War against American Indians, who were trying to preserve their territory north of the Ohio River. In 1789, 19-year-old William Clark joined a volunteer militia force under Major John Hardin. Clark kept a detailed journal of the expedition, beginning a lifelong practice. Hardin was advancing against the Wea Indians, who had been raiding settlements in Kentucky, on the Wabash River. In error, the undisciplined Kentucky militia attacked a peaceful Shawnee hunting camp, where they killed a total of eight men, women, and children.

In 1790, Clark was commissioned by General Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, as a captain in the Clarksville, Indiana militia. One older source says he was sent on a mission to the Creek and Cherokee, whom the US hoped to keep out of the war, in the Southeast. His responsibilities are unclear. He may have visited New Orleans at that time. His travels prevented him from participating in General Josiah Harmar&#x27;s disastrous campaign into the Northwest Territory that year.

In 1791, Clark served as an ensign and acting lieutenant with expeditions under generals Charles Scott and James Wilkinson. He enlisted in the Legion of the United States and was commissioned as a lieutenant on March 6, 1792, under Anthony Wayne. On September 4, 1792, he was assigned to the 4th Sub-Legion. He was involved in several skirmishes with Indians during the continuing Northwest Indian War. At the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, Clark commanded a company of riflemen who drove back the enemy on the left flank, killing a number of Native Americans and Canadians. This decisive US victory brought the Northwest Indian War to an end. In 1795, Clark was dispatched on a mission to New Madrid, Missouri. Clark also served as an adjutant and quartermaster while in the militia.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==

William Clark resigned his commission on July 4, 1796, and retired due to poor health, although he was only 26 years old. He returned to Mulberry Hill, his family&#x27;s plantation near Louisville. His father died in 1799, at which point Clark inherited eight enslaved men, women, and children. In 1799, he claimed ownership of least twenty-three enslaved African Americans. 

In 1803, Meriwether Lewis recruited Clark, then age 33, to share command of the newly formed Corps of Discovery, whose mission was to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase, establish trade with Native Americans, and consolidate the sovereignty of the US. They were to find a waterway from the US to the Pacific Ocean and claim the Oregon territory for the United States before European nations did. Clark spent three years on the expedition to the Pacific Coast. A slave owner known to deal harshly with his slaves, he brought York, one of his slaves, with him. The indigenous nations treated York with respect, and many of the Native Americans were interested in his appearance, which &quot;played a key role in diplomatic relations&quot;.

Although Clark was refused a promotion to the rank of captain when Jefferson asked the Senate to appoint him, at Lewis&#x27; insistence, he exercised equal authority, and continued the mission. Clark concentrated chiefly on the drawing of maps, the management of the expedition&#x27;s supplies, and leading hunting expeditions for game.

==Indigenous nations and war==
In 1807, President Jefferson appointed Clark as the brigadier general of the militia in the Louisiana Territory, and the US agent for Indian affairs. At the time, trade was a major goal and the US established the factory system. The government and its appointees licensed traders to set up trading posts in Native American territory. Native American relations were handled in what became the War Department. Clark set up his headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, where he would live for most of the rest of his life.

There he became a member of the Freemasons, a secret fraternal group. The records of his initiation do not exist, but on September 18, 1809, Saint Louis Lodge No. 111 issued a traveling certificate for Clark.

As a reward for their contributions during their expedition to the Pacific Lewis and Clark were given government positions. Jefferson appointed Meriwether Lewis territorial governor of Upper Louisiana, commander-in-chief of the militia, and superintendent of Indian Affairs. Although he was in charge of Indian affairs, Clark was under the supervision of the Governor of the Louisiana Territory. The governor had final say of all decisions made in the territory. Although Clark had primary duties in dealing with the Native Americans, &quot;the territorial governor held the title of ex officio superintendent of Indian affairs.

Clark&#x27;s experiences during his cross-continent expedition gave him the tools to be the ideal candidate for a diplomat to the Native Americans. That was Jefferson&#x27;s motives behind giving Clark these duties, although it would not be until Madison&#x27;s presidency that Clark&#x27;s title became official. President James Madison appointed Clark as Missouri territorial governor and thus &quot;ex officio&quot; superintendent of Indian affairs in that region, during the summers of 1808 and 1813. In the earlier period, Clark performed the same duties that he would have if he held the title. During the years while Clark held position under Governor Lewis, he was continuously involved in decision-making with him. Clark was consulted on affairs on a regular basis. In Louisiana and Missouri, Clark served the United States government for the longest term in history as diplomat to the Native American peoples.

Indian diplomacy occupied much of Clark&#x27;s time; the dutiful soldier and bureaucrat never wavered in his commitment to an expansionist national agenda that expected Indians to surrender their lands, abandon their traditional ways, and acquiesce to the dictates of the U.S. government. But he was aware of the consequences and he demonstrated genuine concern for the plight of destitute native people increasingly threatened with extinction, so much so that Indian-hating frontier settlers called him an &quot;Indian lover&quot;. Clark&#x27;s expeditions and frontier settlement gave him unique views and feelings toward Native Americans. He felt as though he held a firm hand when he had to, but at the same time he had passion towards them as people still deserving of rights. At times he was said to be too compassionate. Clark took his position as one of extreme importance to not only the government of the United States, but to the Native American people as well.

Clark recognized Indians&#x27; nationalism, their history, language, culture, and territory and negotiated treaties between the various nations and his. He tried to protect Indians and preserve their culture by removing them from the influences of white society, providing life-saving inoculations, having their portraits painted, and assembling a museum of Indian artifacts. At the same time, he removed Indians from their ancestral lands; encouraged federal &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;education&quot; programs to change native lifestyles, religious beliefs, and cultural practices; and usually promoted the interests of American citizens over Indian needs and desires.

During the War of 1812, Clark led several campaigns, among them in 1814, one along the Mississippi River, up to the Prairie du Chien area. He established the short-lived Fort Shelby, the first post in what is now Wisconsin. Soon, the post was captured by the British. 

==Governor of Missouri==

When the Missouri Territory was formed in 1813, Clark was appointed as the governor by President Madison. He was reappointed to the position by Madison in 1816, and in 1820 by President Monroe.

William Clark appeared before Supreme Court Judge John B.C. Lucas in St. Louis on July 6, 1813, to take the oath of office as governor of the Missouri Territory. Clark&#x27;s road to a gubernatorial appointment was long and complex. Upon Lewis&#x27; appointment by Jefferson, Clark backed him and at times filled the role of governor without holding official position, due to Lewis&#x27; complications in life, whether it was debt, loneliness, or drinking. Upon the death of Lewis in 1809, Clark declined to take office for varying reasons.

By the time he was appointed governor, Clark appreciated his own capabilities and embraced them rather than turning them away. When he took office, America was involved in the War of 1812 with the British. Clark feared the influence the British would have on the Native Americans. British tactics would include the use of Indians as allies in the fighting against the United States. In return for British victory, Indians would either be able to continue to occupy their current land or receive lands back that were taken from them previously by the United States Government. Clark held office for the next seven years until he was voted out of office in 1820, in the first election after Missouri became a state. He was defeated by Alexander McNair.

==Superintendent of Indian Affairs==

In 1822, Clark was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs by President James Monroe, a new position created by Congress after the factory system was abolished. Clark served in that position until his death; his title changed with the creation of the Office of Indian Affairs in 1824 and finally the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1829, both within the War Department. From 1824 to 1825, he was additionally appointed surveyor general of Illinois, Missouri, and the Territory of Arkansaw. It was around this time that Clark received a rare smoking pipe or calumet as a gift from a Potowatomi chief in Missouri. The pipe is held in the British Museum&#x27;s collection.

As the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Clark was the most important man on Native American matters west of the Mississippi. As superintendent at St. Louis, Clark took on some additional duties: he issued licenses and granted passports to traders and travelers; provided payments for injuries and injustices to both whites and Indians; invoked military force to arrest lawbreakers; prevented or terminated hostilities between tribes; removed unauthorized persons from Indian country or confiscated their property; established, marked, and surveyed boundaries; distributed annuities and made sure that treaty provisions were delivered; and conducted treaty councils. Of the four superintendents of Indian affairs, the others were the governors of Michigan, Florida, and Arkansas territories; Clark had by far the largest superintendency.

Though Clark tried to maintain peaceful relations with indigenous nations and negotiated peace treaties, he was in charge of implementing President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Indian removal policy. He managed retaliation against Black Hawk and those allied with him in the Black Hawk War, when hostilities arose between them and the Americans. Clark issued &quot;an extermination order&quot;, which he gave to Lewis Cass, a man who played a central role in Jackson&#x27;s removal policy.

Clark believed in the Jeffersonian ideology in which assimilation would be the best course of action for Native Americans. However, in the end, relocation of the Indians from their native lands became the government&#x27;s primary goal, and even the assimilated Five Civilized Tribes were moved by force (threat of military action). Clark&#x27;s government position on Native American affairs kept him at the forefront of countless relocations. He expressed sympathy for those uprooted tribes and promoted their interests as he understood them, nevertheless, he agreed with and implemented the policy of Indian removal, negotiating 37, or one-tenth, of all ratified treaties between American Indians and the United States. Over the course of his career, millions of acres passed from Indian to U.S. ownership through Clark&#x27;s hand.

==Later life and death==
William Clark died in St. Louis on September 1, 1838, at age 68. Clark was originally buried at his nephew John O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s property, in 1838. That area is now known as O&#x27;Fallon Park. The funeral procession stretched for more than a mile and cannons fired a military salute. The entire city of St. Louis mourned his passing.

Clark and six of his family members were later buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery on October 23, 1860. The monument that marks their graves, a gray granite obelisk, was dedicated in 1904 on the centennial anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. Clark&#x27;s son, Jefferson Kearney Clark, designed the monument and paid $25,000 for it ($425,000 in 2005 figures). Jefferson Clark&#x27;s wife had to complete the building of the monument after Jefferson died in 1900. Many years later, the monument was restored and rededicated on May 21, 2004, to mark the bicentennial of the Corps of Discovery&#x27;s departure from St. Charles, Missouri. Members of the Shoshone, Osage, and Mandan tribes spoke at the ceremony, marking Clark&#x27;s service to these Indian nations during the final years of his life.

==Marriage and family==
After returning from his cross-country expedition, Clark married Julia Hancock on January 5, 1808, at Fincastle, Virginia. They had five children: Meriwether Lewis Clark, Sr. (1809–1881), named after his friend and expedition partner; William Preston Clark (1811–1840); Mary Margaret Clark (1814–1821); George Rogers Hancock Clark (1816–1858), named after Clark&#x27;s older brother; and John Julius Clark (1818–1831), named after his oldest brother Jonathan and Clark&#x27;s wife.

After Julia&#x27;s death in 1820, William Clark married Julia&#x27;s first cousin, Harriet Kennerly Radford. They had three children together: Jefferson Kearny Clark (1824–1900), named after the president; Edmund Clark (1826–1827), named after another of his older brothers; and Harriet Clark, named after her mother (dates unknown; died as child). His second wife Harriet died in 1831.

Clark allegedly had a Nez Perce son, Tzi-Kal-Tza/Halahtookit. Clark also served as a guardian to Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the son of Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau.

Clark was a habitually cruel enslaver. He repeatedly refused requests from York to live in Louisville with his family. Clark regularly whipped the people he enslaved, bragging about it in letters to his brother. He freed York but also owned slaves until his death, leaving some enslaved persons to his children in his will.

==Legacy==
===Honors===
* Clark was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.
*Both Lewis and Clark appear on the gold Lewis and Clark Exposition dollars minted for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Among the early United States commemorative coins, they were produced in both 1904 and 1905 and survive in relatively small numbers.
*Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were honored with a 3-cent stamp July 24, 1954, on the 150th anniversary of their expedition.
* In 1965, Clark was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.
* In 1996, Clark was inducted to the St. Louis Walk of Fame.
* In 2001, President Bill Clinton promoted Clark to the rank of captain in the US Army posthumously. Descendants of Clark were there to mark the occasion.
*Celebrations took place on the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. On May 14, 2004, the 200th anniversary of its outset, two companion 37-cent stamps were issued showing portraits of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. A special 32-page booklet accompanied the issue in eleven cities along the route taken by the Corps of Discovery. On May 21, 2004, there was a rededication ceremony of the obelisk at Clark&#x27;s grave site. Although his family had established endowments to maintain his grave site, by the late 20th century, the grave site had fallen into disrepair. His descendants raised $100,000 to rehabilitate the obelisk. The ceremony was attended by a large gathering of Clark&#x27;s descendants, reenactors in period dress, and leaders from the Osage Nation and the Lemhi band of the Shoshone.

===Eponyms===
* The western American plant genus &quot;Clarkia&quot; (in the evening primrose family &quot;Onagraceae&quot;), is named after him, as are the cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki&quot;), and Clark&#x27;s nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot;), a large passerine bird, in the family Corvidae. All were species which Clark identified during the expedition.
* There are counties named in his honor in six states: Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, and Washington.
* The city of Clarkston, Washington is named for him.
* Natural features named for Clark include the Clarks River in western Kentucky, as well as the Clark Fork in Montana and Idaho, the Clarks Fork Yellowstone River in Montana and Wyoming, and Clark&#x27;s Mountain in Oregon.
* Two U.S. Navy Vessels have been named in honor of Clark; the Polaris nuclear submarine USS &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; and the supply ship USNS &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; were named for him and Lewis.
* The Clark Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge across the Mississippi River between West Alton, Missouri and Alton, Illinois, was named after him.
* Several higher education institutions are named for the explorers, including Lewis and Clark Community College in the Metro East region of Illinois, Lewis and Clark Law School and Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho.

<doc id="215917" wikidata="Q449083" url="?curid=215917" title="Company Flow">
<text>Company Flow was an American hip hop trio from Brooklyn, New York City, consisting of Bigg Jus, El-P and Mr. Len.

The group was at one time associated with the independent record label Rawkus Records. Rapper/producer El-P and DJ/producer Mr. Len founded the group in 1992 in Queens, New York where rapper/producer Bigg Jus later joined.

==History==
Founding members El-P and Mr. Len met when the latter was hired to perform as a DJ at the former&#x27;s 18th birthday party. The two quickly became friends and formed Company Flow in 1993. They released their first single, &quot;Juvenile Techniques&quot; later the same year. After El-P was introduced to Bigg Jus by underground rapper and indie label owner ANTTEX, the trio then released their debut EP, &quot;Funcrusher&quot;, on their own label Official Recordings in 1995. A follow-up single, &quot;8 Steps to Perfection&quot; was put out in 1996. Subject to a major label bidding war on Libra Records, Company Flow waited until they could get a contract on their own terms. They eventually signed to Rawkus, and helped revitalize underground rap with labelmates like Mos Def. Their full-length debut album &quot;Funcrusher Plus was&quot; released in 1997 on Rawkus. After two years of pushing the album and touring, group member Bigg Jus decided to strike out on his own and the group amicably dissolved. El-P and Mr. Len followed up their debut with the instrumental album &quot;Little Johnny from the Hospitul: Breaks &amp; Instrumentals Vol.1&quot; (Rawkus).

By 2000, the relationship with Rawkus had disintegrated. The label was accused of neglecting the group&#x27;s talent and being financially dishonest. The staff was fired shortly before Christmas, and Company Flow announced their departure from Rawkus shortly thereafter. Separately, El-P and Mr. Len ended their own deals with Rawkus, effectively severing the relationship between the three and Rawkus. El-P started his own record label (Definitive Jux) and pursued a solo career before eventually forming Run the Jewels with Killer Mike. Mr. Len has done the same with his (Dummy Smacks Records). Bigg Jus has released work on Big Dada and Mush Records.

Bigg Jus stated in 2006 that he was working on material for a new Company Flow album, suggesting the possibility of the group re-forming. Company Flow reunited for a show on October 19, 2007 in Brooklyn, New York City as well as a show on July 16, 2011, and supported Portishead at the I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror festival at Alexandra Palace, London, on July 23, 2011.

Company Flow performed their final show as a group at Coachella in 2012.

<text>John Wesley Powell (March 24, 1834 – September 23, 1902) was an American geologist, U.S. Army soldier, explorer of the American West, professor at Illinois Wesleyan University, and director of major scientific and cultural institutions. He is famous for his 1869 geographic expedition, a three-month river trip down the Green and Colorado rivers, including the first official U.S. government-sponsored passage through the Grand Canyon.

Powell was appointed by US President James A. Garfield to serve as the second director of the U.S. Geological Survey (1881–1894) and proposed, for development of the arid West, policies that were prescient for his accurate evaluation of conditions. Two years prior to his service as director of the U.S. Geological Survey, Major Powell had become the first director of the Bureau of Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution where he supported linguistic and sociological research and publications.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Powell was born in Mount Morris, New York, in 1834, the son of Joseph and Mary Powell. His father, a poor itinerant preacher, had emigrated to the U.S. from Shrewsbury, England, in 1831. His family moved westward to Jackson, Ohio, then to Walworth County, Wisconsin, before settling in rural Boone County, Illinois.

As a young man he undertook a series of adventures through the Mississippi River valley. In 1855, he spent four months walking across Wisconsin. During 1856, he rowed the Mississippi from St. Anthony, Minnesota, to the sea. In 1857, he rowed down the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to the Mississippi River, traveling north to reach St. Louis. In 1858, he rowed down the Illinois River, then up the Mississippi and the Des Moines River to central Iowa. In 1859, at age 25, he was elected to the Illinois Natural History Society.

===Education===
Powell studied at Illinois College, Illinois Institute (which would later become Wheaton College), and Oberlin College, over a period of seven years while teaching, but was unable to attain his degree. While there, he was a member of Sigma Pi Literary Society.

During his studies Powell acquired a knowledge of Ancient Greek and Latin. Powell had a restless nature and a deep interest in the natural sciences. This desire to learn about natural sciences was against the wishes of his father, yet Powell was still determined to do so. In 1861 when Powell was on a lecture tour he decided that a civil war was inevitable; he decided to study military science and engineering to prepare himself for the imminent conflict.

==Civil War and aftermath==
Powell&#x27;s loyalties remained with the Union and the cause of abolishing slavery. On May 8, 1861, he enlisted at Hennepin, Illinois, as a private in the 20th Illinois Infantry. He was elected sergeant-major of the regiment, and when the 20th Illinois was mustered into the Federal service a month later, Powell was commissioned a second lieutenant. He enlisted in the Union Army as a cartographer, topographer and military engineer.

While stationed at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, he recruited an artillery company that became Battery &#x27;F&#x27; of the 2nd Illinois Light Artillery, with Powell as captain. On November 28, 1861, Powell took a brief leave to marry Emma Dean. At the Battle of Shiloh, he lost most of his right arm when struck by a Minié ball while in the process of giving the order to fire. The raw nerve endings in his arm caused him pain for the rest of his life.

Despite the loss of an arm, he returned to the Army and was present at the battles of Champion Hill, Big Black River Bridge, and in the siege of Vicksburg. Always the geologist, he took to studying rocks while in the trenches at Vicksburg. He was made a major and commanded an artillery brigade with the 17th Army Corps during the Atlanta campaign. After the fall of Atlanta he was transferred to George H. Thomas&#x27; army and participated in the battle of Nashville. At the end of the war he was made a brevet lieutenant colonel but preferred to use the title of &quot;major&quot;.

After leaving the Army, Powell took the post of professor of geology at Illinois Wesleyan University. He also lectured at Illinois State Normal University for most of his career. Powell helped expand the collections of the Museum of the Illinois State Natural History Society, where he served as curator. He declined a permanent appointment in favor of exploration of the American West.

==Geologic research==
===Expeditions===


After 1867, Powell led a series of expeditions into the Rocky Mountains and around the Green and Colorado rivers. One of these expeditions was with his students and his wife, to collect specimens all over Colorado. Powell, William Byers, and five other men were the first white men to climb Longs Peak in 1868.

In 1869, he set out to explore the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon. Gathering ten men, four boats and food for 10 months, he set out from Green River, Wyoming, on May 24. Passing through dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River to its confluence with the Colorado River (then also known as the Grand River upriver from the junction), near present-day Moab, Utah, and completed the journey on August 30, 1869.

The members of the first Powell expedition were:
* John Wesley Powell, trip organizer and leader, major in the Civil War
* John Colton &quot;Jack&quot; Sumner, hunter, trapper, soldier in the Civil War
* William H. Dunn, hunter, trapper from Colorado
* Walter H. Powell, captain in the Civil War, John&#x27;s brother
* George Y. Bradley, lieutenant in the Civil War, expedition chronicler
* Oramel G. Howland, printer, editor, hunter
* Seneca Howland, soldier who was wounded in the Battle of Gettysburg
* Frank Goodman, Englishman, adventurer
* W.R. Hawkins, cook, soldier in Civil War
* Andrew Hall, Scotsman, the youngest of the expedition

The expedition&#x27;s route traveled through the Utah canyons of the Colorado River, which Powell described in his published diary as having

Frank Goodman quit after the first month, and Dunn and the Howland brothers left at Separation Canyon in the third month. This was just two days before the group reached the mouth of the Virgin River on August 30, after traversing almost . The three disappeared; some historians have speculated they were killed by the Shivwits Band of Paiutes or by Mormons in the town of Toquerville.

Powell retraced part of the 1869 route in 1871–72 with another expedition that traveled the Colorado River from Green River, Wyoming to Kanab Creek in the Grand Canyon. Powell used three photographers on this expedition; Elias Olcott Beaman, James Fennemore, and John K. Hillers. This trip resulted in photographs (by John K. Hillers), an accurate map and various papers. At least one Powell scholar, Otis R. Marston, noted the maps produced from the survey were impressionistic rather than precise. In planning this expedition, he employed the services of Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon missionary in southern Utah who had cultivated relationships with Native Americans. Before setting out, Powell used Hamblin as a negotiator to ensure the safety of his expedition from local Indian groups.

===After the Colorado===
In 1881, Powell was appointed the second director of the U.S. Geological Survey, a post he held until his resignation in 1894, being replaced by Charles Walcott. In 1875, Powell published a book based on his explorations of the Colorado, originally titled &quot;Report of the Exploration of the Colorado River of the West and Its Tributaries&quot;. It was revised and reissued in 1895 as &quot;The Exploration of the Colorado River and Its Canyons&quot;. In 1889, the intellectual gatherings Powell hosted in his home were formalized as the Cosmos Club. The club has continued, with members elected to the club for their contributions to scholarship and civic activism.

In the early 1900s the journals of the expedition crew began to be published starting with Dellenbaugh&#x27;s &quot;A Canyon Voyage&quot; in 1908, followed in 1939 by the diary of Almon Harris Thompson, who was married to Powell&#x27;s sister, Ellen Powell Thompson. Bishop, Steward, W.C. Powell, and Jones&#x27; diaries were all published in 1947. These diaries made it clear Powell&#x27;s writings contained some exaggerations and recounted activities that occurred on the second river trip as if they occurred on the first. They also revealed that Powell, who had only one arm, wore a life jacket, though the other men did not have them.

==Anthropological research==

Powell spent time among the Native Peoples of the Colorado Plateau and wrote an influential classification of North American Indian languages. He became the director of the Bureau of Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution in 1879 and remained so until his death. He was also the first president of the Anthropological Society of Washington, founded in 1879. From 1894 to 1899, Powell held a post as lecturer on the History of Culture in the Political Science department at the Columbian University in Washington, D.C.. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1898.

Many of Powell&#x27;s anthropological writings draw upon his interactions with Native Americans during the 1870s as director of the Powell Survey. These include his studies of Indian languages which are based in part on vocabulary lists he compiled during this period.

After Powell assumed near-permanent residency in Washington, D.C. as director of the Bureau of Ethnology and the U.S. Geological Survey, his contributions to anthropology consisted increasingly of hiring others to conduct field research and abstract theorizing. Powell was a friend and follower of Lewis Henry Morgan whose 1877 book Ancient Society argued that all human societies progressed from &quot;savagery&quot; to &quot;barbarism&quot; and finally &quot;civilization.&quot; These classifications were based on factors such as technology, family and social organization, property relations, and religion. Powell, like Morgan, believed that this course of development was linear and universal. 

As many scholars have noted, Morgan&#x27;s hierarchical schema was often used to justify the dispossession of Native peoples and to support theories of racial difference. Indeed, the study of ethnology was often a way for scientists to demarcate social categories in order to justify government-sponsored programs that exploited newly appropriated land and its inhabitants. Believing that &quot;progress&quot; was linear and inevitable, Powell advocated for government funding to be used to &#x27;civilize&#x27; Native American populations, pushing for the teaching of English, Christianity, and Western methods of farming and manufacture. However, Powell was not a Social Darwinist; his schemes for cultural assimilation and resource sharing in the Arid Region called for complex government intervention, a far cry from the libertarianism advocated by people like Herbert Spencer. Nor did Powell consider race a more important factor than culture for explaining differences between human groups.

Powell is credited with coining the word &quot;acculturation&quot;, first using it in an 1880 report by the U.S. Bureau of American Ethnography. In 1883, Powell defined &quot;acculturation&quot; as psychological changes induced by cross-cultural imitation.

Powell&#x27;s interest in anthropology may have begun during his apprenticeship to George Crookham, an amateur naturalist whose residence in Jackson, Ohio, coincided with that of the Powell family. Crookham maintained a &quot;museum of natural curiosities&quot; that included artifacts of the recently displaced Shawnee People. As an adult, Powell seems to have believed (in line with Morgan&#x27;s theory of social development) that Native Americans embodied a more &quot;primitive&quot; phase of human society than that of their white European counterparts. For example, in &quot;The Exploration of the Canyons of the Colorado&quot;, he describes the subsistence practices of a group of Indians &quot;more nearly in their primitive condition than any others on the continent with whom I am acquainted.&quot; And in 1939, Julian Steward, an anthropologist compiling photographs from Powell&#x27;s 1873 expedition, wrote, &quot;[f]ascinated at finding Native Americans nearly untouched by civilization, he [Powell] developed a deep interest in ethnology.&quot; Although, as Wallace Stegner observes in &quot;Beyond the 100th Meridian&quot;, by 1869 many Native American tribes had been pushed to extinction, and many of those who survived had experienced significant intercultural exchange. It was partially in reference to this ongoing destruction and transformation of Native societies that Powell, in an 1878 report to the Secretary of the Interior, pleaded for government investments in ethnography, while also arguing that such investments would improve the government&#x27;s efforts at assimilation.

Powell&#x27;s contribution to anthropology and scientific racism is not well known in the geosciences, however a recent article revisited Powell&#x27;s legacy in terms of his social and political impact on Native Americans.

==Indian policy==
In order to secure government funding for anthropological research, Powell argued that such research was necessary to support federal Indian policy. Powell&#x27;s scientific work often coincided with political advocacy as he sought to advise federal agencies, Native peoples, and politicians about how best to manage the influx of white settlers to the West. In general, Powell supported the government&#x27;s goal of assimilation while declaring those who expected it to occur &quot;in the twinkling of an eye&quot; unrealistic.

In 1873, in response to tensions surrounding the Modoc War, Powell temporarily left his directorship of the Powell Survey to serve as a special commissioner for the Department of the Interior. He and co-commissioner George Ingalls delivered a report in December of that year recommending a program to relocate members of the Ute, Paiute, Shoshone, and Western Shoshone peoples to reservations where, Powell and Ingalls hoped, they would practice Western-style agriculture and be insulated from further conflicts with white settlers. Despite their efforts, &quot;[n]either the whites nor the Indians followed the commission&#x27;s recommendations in the next few years.&quot;

In his 1878 Report on the Methods of Surveying the Public Domain, Powell criticized previous efforts at assimilation for not recognizing the structure and complexity of Native societies. &quot;Savagery is not inchoate civilization,&quot; he wrote; &quot;it is a distinct status of society, with its own institutions, customs, philosophy, and religion; and all these must necessarily be overthrown before new institutions, customs, philosophy, and religion can be introduced.&quot; The report called for respecting the democratic nature of tribal decision-making and understanding Native aversion to the idea of land ownership by individuals.

Some of Powell&#x27;s most dismissive remarks about Native society are recorded in an 1880 letter to Senator H.M. Teller of Utah, in which Powell states that the removal of Indians from their ancestral lands &quot;is the first step to be taken in their civilization.&quot; Attorney and historian Charles Wilkinson calls this letter &quot;cynical&quot; and &quot;treacherous&quot; and &quot;the darkest episode&quot; of Powell&#x27;s career.&quot;

Powell&#x27;s descriptions of Native land-use practices were sometimes inaccurate and served to advance settler colonial goals. For example, in his 1878 Report on the Lands of the Arid Region, Powell attributes widespread forest fires to Native agency and concludes &quot;[t]he fires can, then, be very greatly curtailed by the removal of the Indians.&quot; William deBuys notes that Powell&#x27;s claims about the extent of the fires is &quot;surprising&quot; and that Powell himself later blamed such fires on white settlers.

== Environmentalism ==
In &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;, Powell is portrayed as a champion of land preservation and conservation. Powell&#x27;s expeditions led to his belief that the arid West was not suitable for agricultural development, except for about 2% of the lands that were near water sources. His &quot;Report on the Lands of the Arid Regions of the United States&quot; proposed reforming the system by which the government distributed land to settlers by taking into account topography and access to water in determining the shape and size of parcels. &quot;Irrigable lands&quot; would be organized into self-regulating irrigation districts to prevent the monopolization of water by those lucky enough to acquire riparian parcels. For the remaining lands, he proposed conservation and low-density, open grazing.

The railroad companies owned – vast tracts of lands granted in return for building the railways – and did not agree with Powell&#x27;s views on land conservation. They aggressively lobbied Congress to reject Powell&#x27;s policy proposals and to encourage farming instead, as they wanted to cash in on their lands. The U.S. Congress went along and developed legislation that encouraged pioneer settlement of the American West based on agricultural use of land. Politicians based their decisions on a theory of Professor Cyrus Thomas who was a protege of Horace Greeley. Thomas suggested that agricultural development of land would change climate and cause higher amounts of precipitations, claiming that &#x27;rain follows the plow&#x27;, a theory which has since been largely discredited.

At an 1893 irrigation conference, Powell would prophetically remark: &quot;Gentlemen, you are piling up a heritage of conflict and litigation over water rights, for there is not sufficient water to supply the land.&quot; Powell&#x27;s recommendations for development of the West were largely ignored until after the Dust Bowl of the 1920s and 1930s, resulting in untold suffering associated with pioneer subsistence farms that failed because of insufficient rain and irrigation water.

==Legacy, honors, and namesakes==
In recognition of his national service, Powell was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. The John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed 12 March 2019, authorizes the establishment of the &quot;John Wesley Powell National Conservation Area&quot;, consisting of approximately 29,868 acres of land in Utah. Green River, Wyoming, the embarkation site of both Powell expeditions, commissioned a statue depicting Powell holding an oar, in front of the Sweetwater County History Museum. In Powell&#x27;s honor, the USGS National Center in Reston, Virginia, was dedicated as the &quot;John Wesley Powell Federal Building&quot; in 1974. In addition, the highest award presented by the USGS to persons outside the federal government is named the John Wesley Powell Award. In 1984, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

The following were named after Powell:
* The rare mineral powellite.
* Lake Powell, a man-made reservoir on the Colorado River.
* Mount Powell, a summit in the Sierra Nevada of California.

== Personal life ==
On November 28, 1861, while serving as captain of Battery &#x27;F&#x27; of the 2nd Illinois Light Artillery at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, he took a brief leave to marry Emma Dean.

On September 10, 1871, Emma Dean gave birth to the Powells&#x27; only child, Mary Dean Powell in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was active in the Wimodaughsis, a national women&#x27;s club in Washington, D.C., started by Anna Howard Shaw and Susan B. Anthony. Emma Dean Powell died on March 13, 1924, in Washington, D.C. She is buried along with her husband in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Tony Louis Cottrell (born May 5, 1976), better known as Hi-Tek, is an American rapper and music producer from Cincinnati, Ohio. He is best known for his work with Talib Kweli. His father is singer Willie Cottrell of the Willie Cottrell Band, whom Hi-Tek featured on his second album, &quot;Hi-Teknology 2&quot;.

== Career ==

=== 1996–2000 ===
Hi-Tek grew up in the West End, Cincinnati. He started his career with hip hop group Mood and had a regional hit with &quot;Hustle on the Side&quot;. That song was made for Mood&#x27;s album &quot;Doom&quot;, which featured amongst others Brooklyn MC Talib Kweli. Hi-Tek went on to produce most of Talib Kweli and Mos Def&#x27;s &quot;Black Star&quot; (1998). In 2000, Tek and Kweli (under the name Reflection Eternal) released &quot;Train of Thought&quot; (2000) on Rawkus Records, with raps by Kweli and beats by Hi-Tek. It enjoyed moderate crossover radio success with the singles &quot;The Blast&quot; and &quot;Move Somethin&#x27;&quot;. Reflection Eternal released a follow-up album titled &quot;Revolutions Per Minute&quot; on May 18, 2010.

=== 2001–present ===
After signing to Rawkus Records, Hi-Tek produced for a number of the labels projects, including the popular &quot;Soundbombing&quot; series; a three-record compilation of mostly Rawkus-based artists. In 2001, he released his solo album &quot;Hi-Teknology&quot; on Rawkus. The album featured appearances by Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, Vinia Mojica, Buckshot, and others, with all production handled by Hi-Tek. It received critical acclaim and spawned a minor hit, &quot;Round and Round&quot; with Cincinnati singer Jonell.

Hi-Tek is a staff producer for Aftermath Entertainment and its affiliates, as well as past associates such as Kweli and Mos Def. He has also recorded songs for Dion Jenkins, an R&amp;B singer signed to Aftermath. &quot;Hi-Teknology 2&quot; was released October 17, 2006, on Babygrande, and distributed by Koch Entertainment. The producer released the third installment, &quot;Hi-Teknology 3: Underground&quot; on December 11, 2007.

In November 2015, producer 9th Wonder announced Hi-Tek as the newest member of The Soul Council – the production staff of his record label It&#x27;s a Wonderful World Music Group.

<text>Clay Straus Jenkinson (born February 4, 1955, in Dickinson, North Dakota) is an American humanities scholar, author and educator. He is currently the director of The Dakota Institute, where he co-hosts public radio&#x27;s &quot;Listening to America, formerly The Thomas Jefferson Hour&quot;, and creates documentary films, symposia, and literary projects. He lectures at Dickinson State University and Bismarck State College.

==Life==
Jenkinson was born in Dickinson, in southwestern North Dakota; his father was a banker and his mother a schoolteacher. Although the family moved quite often when he and his sister were children, Jenkinson grew up mostly in Dickinson. He graduated from Dickinson High School in 1973 and then attended Vanderbilt University and the University of Minnesota. He graduated in 1977 with a degree in English, and was then a Rhodes scholar at Oxford.

In 2005 at the age of 50 Jenkinson returned to North Dakota as a permanent resident; he resides in Bismarck. He is currently the Director of The Dakota Institute through The Lewis &amp; Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, Chief Consultant to The Theodore Roosevelt Center through Dickinson State University, and a Distinguished Humanities Scholar at Bismarck State College. He is James Marsh Professor-at-Large at the University of Vermont.

Jenkinson has one child, Catherine Missouri Walker Jenkinson, from his marriage to Etta L. Walker (they married on 16 March 1986 and divorced in 1997). His daughter was named after the Little Missouri River.

Jenkinson has appeared in a number of Ken Burns&#x27; documentaries, including &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot;, The Roosevelts and in Burns’ 2023 documentary &quot;The American Buffalo&quot;.

==Portrayal of Jefferson==
Jenkinson first achieved fame for his portrayal (first-person historical interpretation) of Thomas Jefferson. On April 11, 1994, he was the first public humanities scholar to present a program at a White House-sponsored event when he presented Thomas Jefferson for a gathering hosted by President and Mrs. Clinton. As co-founder of the modern Chautauqua movement, Jenkinson has also portrayed Sir Francis Bacon, Jonathan Swift, J. Robert Oppenheimer, John Wesley Powell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Theodore Roosevelt, and Meriwether Lewis.

Jenkinson&#x27;s public portrayals take the form of lengthy monologues followed by Q &amp; A sessions as the character (in costume) featured for that performance. At the end of his performances, he steps out of character and answers questions as himself. Another performance variation is represented by his nationally syndicated radio show, &quot;The Thomas Jefferson Hour&quot;:
&quot;While staying resolutely in character, Mr. Jenkinson permits Jefferson to answer audience questions on a broad range of historical subjects and comment carefully on contemporary social and political topics.&quot;

On November 15, 2006, Clay appeared as Jefferson on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; with two other Jefferson impersonators, Bill Barker and Steven Edenbo.

==Awards==
In 1989, Jenkinson became one of the first winners of the nation&#x27;s highest award in the humanities, the Charles Frankel Prize, awarded by President George H.W. Bush for his achievements. The National Endowment for the Humanities once described Jenkinson as &quot;A leader in the revival of Chautauqua, a forum for public discussion about the ideas and lives of key figures in American history.&quot; He has been awarded the Robert J. Laxalt Writer of the Year Award from University of Nevada-Reno and is a Rhodes scholar and Danforth Scholar. Jenkinson was a senior fellow for the Center for Digital Government, based in California, and was scholar-in-residence at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon from 2002 to 2006, and Roosevelt scholar-in-residence at Dickinson State University from 2005 to 2008. In 2004, Jenkinson was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame, a signature event of Norsk Høstfest.

<doc id="215923" wikidata="Q15069660" url="?curid=215923" title="Organized Konfusion">
<text>Organized Konfusion (OK) is an alternative hip hop duo from Queens, New York, composed of Prince Po and Pharoahe Monch.
==History==
===Recording career===
Group members Prince Po and Pharoahe Monch began their career under the name Simply II Positive MCs. Originally, Po was the rapper and Pharoahe was a beatboxer, but after realizing his rhyming skill, Monch joined Po as MC. The duo caught the attention of hip hop producer Paul C, who produced a demo for the group in the late 1980s. They signed a record deal with a small record company in Queens named Solid Sound Records. Two producers named Kevin Osborne and Neal Kelley produced two singles for the group. The first was &quot;Memories of Love&quot; in 1987 and the second was &quot;South Side in Effect&quot;. In 1987, they released &quot;Memories of Love&quot;; however, it did not receive any radio play. During that time, Def Jam was considering signing the duo, which led to the group changing its name. In an interview with Halftimeonline.net, Monch stated: 

Paul C was murdered in 1989, but the duo went on and signed a record deal with Hollywood BASIC. In 1991, the group released its critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, &quot;Organized Konfusion&quot;. The album was produced entirely by the duo, and featured only one guest appearance, provided by the group&#x27;s childhood friend, future D.I.T.C. member O.C., who appeared on the single &quot;Fudge Pudge&quot;. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Walk Into The Sun&quot;, became a minor hit for the group, peaking at No. 15 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The album itself did not make any Billboard chart, despite high praise from numerous sources, including AllMusic, which granted the album a perfect five-star rating, with reviewer Stanton Swihart stating that it is &quot;arguably &quot;the&quot; underground [hip-hop] album of the 1990s.&quot;

The duo returned in 1994 with their second album, &quot;&quot;. This album was once more low on guests, featuring another appearance by O.C., and A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s Q-Tip, who both appeared on the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Organize&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Stress&quot; charted on the Hot Rap Singles chart, but the most famous song from the album is arguably &quot;Stray Bullet&quot;, a concept track which sees the MCs describing the travels of a stray bullet in first-person narrative.

In 1996, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD, &quot;America is Dying Slowly&quot;, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as &quot;a masterpiece&quot; by The Source magazine.

Following the release of &quot;Stress&quot;, Organized Konfusion moved from Hollywood BASIC to Priority Records. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Equinox&quot;, was released in 1997. The album featured a concept, complete with numerous storytelling skits. Many saw the concept as a failure, which led to the album receiving less critical acclaim when compared to the group&#x27;s previous efforts. Led by the single &quot;Somehow, Someway&quot;, the album managed to reach higher on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts than its last two albums.

===Separation===
After this release, Prince Po and Pharoahe Monch split to pursue solo careers. In a 2005 interview with MVRemix.com, Prince Po discussed the break-up:
::—Prince Po 

===Solo careers===
Pharoahe Monch signed a deal with Rawkus Records after the duo&#x27;s break up, and released a highly acclaimed solo album, &quot;Internal Affairs&quot;, in 1999. The album just missed a debut in the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and spawned the Hot 100 hit single &quot;Simon Says&quot;. Pharoahe and Rawkus were met with a lawsuit over a &quot;Godzilla&quot; sample used in the track, which forced Rawkus to pull the album off the shelves, to be re-released without the single. The album was not re-released and remains out of print. OK partner Prince Po joined Pharoahe for an appearance on the track &quot;God Send&quot;. Other album guests included Canibus, M.O.P., Busta Rhymes, Apani B, Common, Talib Kweli, Redman, Method Man, Lady Luck and Shabaam Sahdeeq.

Prince Po released his solo debut &quot;The Slickness&quot; in 2004 on Lex Records. The album almost completely missed the radar, but received fair reviews. Guests included Jemini, Rell, MF Doom and Raekwon.

Between 2004 and 2005, Pharoahe recorded an album while he was signed to MCA/Geffen Records, which was never released. After a bidding war between prominent labels such as Bad Boy Records, Shady Records and Sony Records, Pharoahe Monch signed a deal with Steve Rifkind&#x27;s SRC Records in February 2006. He released his second album, &quot;Desire&quot;, on June 26, 2007. Prince Po released his second solo album &quot;Prettyblack&quot; on August 8, 2006. Around this time he was also featured on Adverse&#x27;s album &quot;David&quot;. Another Po solo LP, &quot;Saga of the Simian Samurai&quot;, was released in November 2007 and was produced entirely by TOMC3. The two had worked together previously on Kool Keith&#x27;s &quot;Project Polaroid&quot;.

===Reunion===
In 2004, it was announced that the group would be reuniting with a new third member, O.C. who made his debut on &quot;Organized Konfusion&quot;. But the reunion was called off due to tensions between O.C. and Prince Po.

In interviews conducted during the promotion of Monch&#x27;s album &quot;Desire&quot;, questions have repeatedly come up in question to whether or not a reunion would take place. Monch likes to answer the questions with a vague, but optimistic, &quot;Who knows what the future holds&quot;. Monch, now signed to a major label, still insists that, if a reunion were to take place, the record would be released on an independent label, citing that the high-end concepts Organized Konfusion deals with and tackles are not heavily supported by major labels.

On March 30, 2009, it was announced that Organized Konfusion would reunite at the 2009 All Points West Festival in Jersey City, New Jersey.

<doc id="215924" wikidata="Q119038" url="?curid=215924" title="Chautauqua">
<text>Chautauqua ( ) is an adult education and social movement in the United States that peaked in popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Chautauqua assemblies expanded and spread throughout rural America until the mid-1920s. The Chautauqua brought entertainment and culture for the whole community, with speakers, teachers, musicians, showmen, preachers, and specialists of the day. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt is often quoted as saying that Chautauqua is &quot;the most American thing in America&quot;. What he actually said was: &quot;it is a source of positive strength and refreshment of mind and body to come to meet a typical American gathering like this—a gathering that is typically American in that it is typical of America at its best.&quot; Several Chautauqua assemblies continue to gather to this day, including the original Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York.

==History==
===First Chautauquas===
In 1874, Methodist Episcopal minister John Heyl Vincent and businessman Lewis Miller organized the New York Chautauqua Assembly at a campsite on the shores of Chautauqua Lake in the state of New York. Two years earlier, Vincent, editor of the &quot;Sunday School Journal&quot;, had begun to train Sunday school teachers in an outdoor summer school format. The gatherings grew in popularity. The organization Vincent and Miller founded later became known as the Chautauqua Institution. Many other independent Chautauquas were developed in a similar manner.

The educational summer camp format proved popular for families and was widely copied by several Chautauquas. Within a decade, &quot;Chautauqua assemblies&quot; (or simply &quot;Chautauquas&quot;), named for the location in New York, sprang up in various North American locations. The Chautauqua movement beginning in the 1870s may be regarded as a successor to the Lyceum movement from the 1840s. As the Chautauquas began to compete for the best performers and lecturers, lyceum bureaus assisted with bookings. Today, Lakeside Chautauqua and the Chautauqua Institution, the two largest Chautauquas, still draw thousands each summer season.

===Independent Chautauquas===
Independent Chautauquas (or &quot;daughter Chautauquas&quot;) operated at permanent facilities, usually fashioned after the Chautauqua Institute in New York, or at rented venues such as in an amusement park. Such Chautauquas were generally built in an attractive semirural location a short distance outside an established town with good rail service. At the Chautauqua movement&#x27;s height in the 1920s, several hundred of these existed, but their numbers have since dwindled.

===Circuit Chautauquas===
&quot;Circuit Chautauquas&quot; (or colloquially, &quot;Tent Chautauquas&quot;) were an itinerant manifestation of the Chautauqua movement founded by Keith Vawter (a Redpath Lyceum Bureau manager) and Roy Ellison in 1904. Vawter and Ellison were unsuccessful in their initial attempts to commercialize Chautauqua, but by 1907 they had found a great success in their adaptation of the concept. The program was presented in tents pitched &quot;on a well-drained field near town&quot;. After several days, the Chautauqua would fold its tents and move on. The method of organizing a series of touring Chautauquas is attributed to Vawter. Among early Redpath comedians was Boob Brasfield.

Reactions to tent Chautauquas were mixed. In &quot;We Called it Culture&quot;, Victoria and Robert Case write of the new itinerant Chautauqua:

The credit–or blame–for devising the Frankenstein mechanism which was both to exalt and to destroy Chautauqua, the tent circuit, must be given to two youths of similar temperament, imagination, and a common purpose. That purpose, bluntly, was to &quot;make a million&quot;.

Frank Gunsaulus attacked Vawter:

&quot;You&#x27;re ruining a splendid movement,&quot; Gunsaulus roared at Keith Vawter, whom he met at a railroad junction. &quot;You&#x27;re cheapening Chautauqua, breaking it down, replacing it with something what will have neither dignity nor permanence.&quot;

In Vawter&#x27;s scheme, each performer or group appeared on a particular day of the program. &quot;First-day&quot; talent would move on to other Chautauquas, followed by the &quot;second-day&quot; performers, and so on, throughout the touring season. By the mid-1920s, when circuit Chautauquas were at their peak, they appeared in over 10,000 communities to audiences of more than 45 million; by about 1940 they had run their course.

==&quot;The Chautauquan&quot;==
&quot;The Chautauquan&quot; was a magazine founded in 1880 by Theodore L. Flood. First printed in Jamestown, New York, the magazine soon found a home in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where Flood bought a printing shop. It printed articles about Christian history, Sunday school lessons, and lectures from Chautauqua. By the end of the decade, the magazine was printing articles by well-known authors of the day (John Pentland Mahaffy, John Burroughs, Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen), and serial educational material (including courses by William Torrey Harris and Arthur Gilman). Strongly allied with the main organization, it had easy access to popular authors (&quot;the big fish in the intellectual sea&quot;, according to Frank Luther Mott), but Flood was wary of making his magazine too dry for popular taste, and sought variety. By 1889 the magazine changed course radically and dropped the serials that were Chautauqua&#x27;s required reading, expanding with articles on history, biography, travel, politics, and literature. One section had editorial articles from national newspapers; another was the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Council Table&quot;, which excerpted articles often by famous women writers, though all this material remained required reading for the Chautauqua program. Contemporary publications regarded the magazine highly, and Mott writes, &quot;its range of topics was indeed remarkable, and its list of contributors impressive&quot;. Flood stopped editing the magazine in 1899, and journalist Frank Chapin Bay, schooled by Chautauqua, took over; the magazine became less a general magazine and more the official organ of the organization.

==Lectures==
Lectures were the mainstay of the Chautauqua. Until 1917, they dominated the circuit Chautauqua programs. The reform speech and the inspirational talk were the two main types of lecture until 1913. Later topics included current events, travel, and stories, often with a comedic twist.

===Most famous speech===
The most prolific speaker (often booked in the same venues with three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan) was Russell Conwell, who delivered his famous &quot;Acres of Diamonds&quot; speech 5,000 times to audiences on the Chautauqua and Lyceum circuits, which had this theme:

Get rich, young man, for money is power and power ought to be in the hands of good people. I say you have no right to be poor.

===Other speakers===
Maud Ballington Booth, the &quot;Little Mother of the Prisons&quot;, was another popular circuit performer. Her descriptions of prison life moved her audiences to tears and roused them to reform. Jane Addams spoke on social problems and her work at Hull House. Helen Potter was another notable Chautauqua performer. She performed a variety of roles, including men and women. Gentile writes: &quot;Potter&#x27;s choice of subjects is noteworthy for its variety and for the fact that she was credible in her impersonations of men as well as of women. In retrospect, Potter&#x27;s impersonations are of special interest as examples of the kind of recycling or refertilization of inspiration that occurs throughout the history of the one-person show.&quot; On a lighter note, author Opie Read&#x27;s stories and homespun philosophy endeared him to audiences. Other well-known speakers and lecturers at Chautauqua events of various forms included U.S. Representative Champ Clark, Missouri Governor Herbert S. Hadley, and Wisconsin Governor &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; La Follette.

==Religious expression==
Christian instruction, preaching, and worship were a big part of the Chautauqua experience. Although the movement was founded by Methodists, nondenominationalism was a Chautauqua principle from the beginning, and prominent Catholics like Catherine Doherty took part. In 1892, Lutheran theologian Theodore Emanuel Schmauk was one of the organizers of the Pennsylvania Chautauqua.

Early religious expression in Chautauqua was usually of a general nature, comparable to the later Moral Re-Armament movement. In the first half of the 20th century, fundamentalism was the subject of an increasing number of Chautauqua sermons and lectures. But the great number of Chautauquas, as well as the absence of any central authority over them, meant that religious patterns varied greatly among them. Some were so religiously oriented that they were essentially church camps, while more secular Chautauquas resembled summer school and competed with vaudeville in theaters and circus tent shows with their animal acts and trapeze acrobats.

One example, Lakeside Chautauqua, is privately owned but affiliated with the United Methodist Church. In contrast, the Colorado Chautauqua is entirely nondenominational and mostly secular.

==Competition with vaudeville==
In the 1890s, both Chautauqua and vaudeville were gaining popularity and establishing themselves as important forms of entertainment. While Chautauqua had its roots in Sunday school and valued morality and education highly, vaudeville grew out of minstrel shows, variety acts, and crude humor, and so the two movements found themselves at odds. Chautauqua was considered wholesome family entertainment and appealed to middle classes and people who considered themselves respectable or aspired to respectability. Vaudeville, on the other hand, was widely considered vulgar babbitry, and appealed to working-class men. There was a stark distinction between the two, and they generally did not share performers or audiences.

At the turn of the 20th century, vaudeville managers began a push for more &quot;refinement&quot;, as well as a loosening of Victorian-era morals from the Chautauqua side. Over time, as vaudeville became more respectable, Chautauqua became more permissive in what it considered acceptable acts. The boundaries between the two began to blur.

==Music==
Music was important to Chautauqua, with band music in particular demand. John Philip Sousa protégé Bohumir Kryl&#x27;s Bohemian Band was frequently seen on the circuit. One of the numbers Kryl featured was the &quot;Anvil Chorus&quot; from &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, with four husky timpanists in leather aprons hammering on anvils shooting sparks (enhanced through special effects) across the darkened stage. Spirituals were also popular. White audiences appreciated seeing African-Americans performing something other than minstrelsy. Other musical features of the Chautauqua included groups like the Jubilee Singers, who sang a mix of spirituals and popular tunes, and singers and instrumental groups like American Quartette, who played popular music, ballads, and songs from the &quot;old country&quot;. Entertainers on the Chautauqua circuit such as Charles Ross Taggart, billed as &quot;The Man From Vermont&quot; and &quot;The Old Country Fiddler&quot;, played violin, sang, performed ventriloquism and comedy, and told tall tales about life in rural New England.

Opera became a part of the Chautauqua experience in 1926, when the American Opera Company, an outgrowth of the Eastman School of Music, began touring the country. Under the direction of Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing, the AOC presented five operas in one week at the Chautauqua Amphitheater. By 1929, a permanent Chautauqua Opera company had been established.

==Political context==
Chautauquas can be viewed in the context of the populist ferment of the late 19th century. Manifestos such as the &quot;Populist Party Platform&quot; voiced disdain for political corruption and championed the plight of the common people in the face of the rich and powerful. Other favorite political reform topics in Chautauqua lectures included temperance (even prohibition), women&#x27;s suffrage, and child labor laws.

But the Chautauqua movement usually avoided taking political stands as such, instead inviting public officials of all major political parties to lecture, assuring a balanced program for the members of the assembly. For example, during the 1936 season at the Chautauqua Institution, in anticipation of that year&#x27;s presidential election, visitors heard addresses by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Republican nominee Alf Landon, and two third-party candidates.

==Typical Chautauqua circuit==
A route taken by a troupe of Chautauqua entertainers, the May Valentine Opera Company, which presented Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot; during its 1925 &quot;Summer Season&quot;, began on March 26 in Abbeville, Louisiana, and ended on September 6 in Sidney, Montana.

==In popular culture==
The Chautauqua style of teaching is a recurring motif in Robert M. Pirsig&#x27;s &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;.

&quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot;, a 1969 film starring Elvis Presley, was based on the 1960 novel &quot;Chautauqua&quot; by Day Keene and Dwight Vincent Babcock.

<text>Great Basin National Park is a national park of the United States located in White Pine County in east-central Nevada, near the Utah border, established in 1986. The park is most commonly entered by way of Nevada State Route 488, which is connected to U.S. Routes 6 and 50 by Nevada State Route 487 via the small town of Baker, the closest settlement.

The park derives its name from the Great Basin, the dry and mountainous region between the Sierra Nevada and the Wasatch Mountains. Topographically, this area is known as the Basin and Range Province. The park is located about north of Las Vegas and protects .

The park is notable for its groves of ancient bristlecone pines, the oldest known living non-clonal organisms; Lehman Caves; Wheeler Peak Glacier, below Wheeler Peak; and some of the darkest night skies in the contiguous United States.

President Warren G. Harding created Lehman Caves National Monument by presidential proclamation on January 24, 1922. The monument and its surroundings was designated a national park on October 27, 1986, following the advocacy of Congressman Harry Reid.

A number of developed campsites are within the park, as well as backcountry camping opportunities. The Highland Ridge Wilderness lies adjacent to Great Basin National Park. These two protected areas provide contiguous wildlife habitat and protection to of eastern Nevada&#x27;s basin lands.

==Natural history ==

===Flora===

Eleven species of conifer trees and over 800 species of plants are found in Great Basin National Park and the neighboring valleys.

The area around the Visitor Center is dominated by plants such as sagebrush, saltbush, single-leaf pinyon, and Utah juniper. Higher elevations are home to mountain meadows, white fir, quaking aspen, Engelmann spruce, and large Ponderosa pine. At treeline is an alpine area of low, delicate plants and rocky outcroppings. There are several endemic species of plants that are found in the park, some of which include Mt. Wheeler sandwort and Holgrem&#x27;s buckwheat.
The oldest nonclonal organism ever discovered, a Great Basin bristlecone pine tree at least 5,000 years old, grew at the treeline near Wheeler Peak in the national park. It was cut down in 1964 by a graduate student and U.S. Forest Service personnel for research purposes. It was given the nickname Prometheus, after the mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.

===Fauna===
Sixty-one species of mammals, 18 species of reptiles, 238 species of birds, two species of amphibians, and eight species of fish are in Great Basin National Park and the neighboring valleys.

;Mammals

An abundance of wildlife has taken advantage of the habitat zones in Great Basin National Park. Jackrabbits, pygmy rabbits, mountain cottontails, ground squirrels, chipmunks, and various mice live in the low-elevation sagebrush desert. Pronghorns, coyotes, kit foxes, and badgers are less common inhabitants.

In the more rugged areas on the slopes of mountains and in the valley areas nearby, cougars, bobcats, marmots, rock squirrels, and bighorn sheep can occasionally be seen throughout this park. Other animals that can be found here include elk, mule deer, spotted skunks, shrews, ringtail cats, and ermine.

;Fish
The Bonneville cutthroat trout is the only fish native to Great Basin National Park. It arrived in the mountain waters naturally and was eventually isolated by changing climatic conditions. Other trout species, such as Lahontan cutthroat trout, rainbow, brook, and brown trout, were stocked in the lakes and streams of the South Snake Range until the park&#x27;s incorporation in 1986.

;Birds
Many species of birds can be found in Great Basin National Park, including Canada geese, hawks, sparrows, bald eagles, tundra swans, barn owls, snow geese, killdeer, golden eagles, woodpeckers, mallards, wrens, greater roadrunners, chickadees, great horned owls, ravens, magpies, and swallows.

;Amphibians
Only two species of amphibians have been positively identified in the southern Snake Range and adjacent portions of Snake and Spring Valleys: the western spadefoot toad &quot;(Spea hammondii)&quot; and the leopard frog &quot;(Rana pipiens)&quot;.

==Geology==

Many of the rocks formed during the Cambrian, when the region lay at the edge of a continental landmass called Laurentia. These rocks include the Cambrian strata. As the Paleozoic era progressed, several intensified geologic events occurred, including repeated episodes of faulting, and in turn, orogenies which involved upward lifting of a metamorphic core complex, creating mafic and rhyolitic dikes and sills.

Extensive volcanism also occurred during the middle to late Cambrian, contributing further to the uplift of the area. This also contributed to a second round of block faulting, in which conglomerates, ash flows, and tuffs accumulated in the Snake Range.

Both continuous and intermittent fault movements also occurred, with individual fault surfaces on both sides of the Snake Range thinning and stretching.

;Glaciation

Glaciation, mostly during a series of ice ages in the Pleistocene, heavily eroded the peaks of the Snake Range, leaving canyon walls, U-shaped valleys, cirques, and moraines throughout the range.

;Lehman Caves

The Lehman Cave system began forming around 550 million years ago (during the Cambrian), while it was still submerged in a relatively warm, shallow ocean. The caves are made up of a marble and limestone solution, for the most part, that forms the many cave decorations throughout the caverns.

The cave system became much deeper during the Pleistocene, when a prolonged and increased flow of water eroded through the cave&#x27;s fracturing bedrock. Eventually, the water level dropped, leaving glare rooms and cavities in the rock, creating the depths of the Lehman Caves system.

==Scenic features==
The park&#x27;s scenic features include Lexington Arch, the Lehman Orchard and Aqueduct, Rhodes Cabin, Stella and Teresa Lakes, and Wheeler Peak Glacier.

===Lehman Caves===
The Lehman Caves were originally protected as a national monument in 1922, which was combined with the national park in 1986. The cave is about two miles long, making it the longest known cave in Nevada. The park offers two different tours of the cave: a 0.6-mile long tour which lasts approximately 90 minutes and a 0.4 mile tour which lasts approximately 60 minutes.

The cave had been known to indigenous peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. In 1885, Absalom Lehman, a rancher in the area, began guiding tours into the cave. Visitors&#x27; inscriptions in the cave from the era before it became a National Monument note its use and popularity among recent settlers to the region.

Several species occupy the Lehman Caves. Bacteria are the most common. Crickets, spiders, pseudoscorpions, mites, and springtails may live their full lifecycles in the cave. They are dependent on organic material packed in by other animals or washed in from the surface.

Other animals use the cave, but must leave to forage for food. These include chipmunks, mice, pack rats, and several species of bats. Only insectivorous bats occur in the Great Basin. At least 10 species of bats have been found in the vicinity of Great Basin National Park, including the Townsend&#x27;s big-eared bat.

===Trails===
The park has 12 trails ranging from . Trails range from short nature trails at (Mountain View Nature Trail), to the Wheeler summit trail starting at . The Wheeler Summit trail is quite strenuous, and the altitude presents significant hazards for unprepared or inexperienced hikers. Backcountry routes are occasionally maintained throughout the more remote southern portion of the park. A number of these trailheads are accessible by the road that terminates at the primitive Shoshone campground.

===Visitor centers===
The Great Basin visitor center is located on Nevada State Route 487 in the town of Baker. The Lehman Caves visitor center is located on Nevada State Route 488, about from Baker, inside the park boundary. The Forgotten Winchester, a rifle manufactured in 1882 that was found leaning against a juniper tree in the park in 2014, is on display inside the Great Basin visitor center. Both centers feature exhibits about the park&#x27;s geology and natural and cultural history, as well as theaters with orientation films.

== Climate ==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Basin National Park has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). The plant hardiness zone at Lehman Caves Visitor Center is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of .

The park lies in an arid region and receives very little rainfall during most of the year. Most precipitation is winter snow or summer thunderstorms. All precipitation in this region evaporates, sinks underground, or flows into lakes — i.e., it is &quot;endorheic&quot;. No water reaches the ocean.

Winters are cool and summers are mild to hot. Weather can change quickly, especially in the back country or on Wheeler Peak at high elevations.
Lehman Caves maintain a fairly constant temperature of with 90% humidity year round.
The climate varies throughout the park, depending on elevation and location. The following data are for the Lehman Caves Visitor Center only. Higher elevations are cooler and receive more precipitation, whereas lower elevations are hotter and drier.

<text>La Vita Nuova (; modern Italian for &quot;The New Life&quot;) or Vita Nova (Latin and medieval Italian title ) is a text by Dante Alighieri published in 1294. It is an expression of the medieval genre of courtly love in a prosimetrum style, a combination of both prose and verse.

==History and context==
Referred to by Dante as his &quot;libello&quot;, or &quot;little book,&quot; &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; is the first of two collections of verse written by Dante in his life. The collection is a &quot;prosimetrum&quot;, a piece containing both verse and prose, in the vein of Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;. Dante used each &quot;prosimetrum&quot; as a means for combining poems written over periods of roughly ten years—&quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; contains his works from before 1283 to roughly 1293. The collection and its style fit in with the movement called &quot;dolce stil novo&quot;. 

The prose creates the illusion of narrative continuity between the poems; it is Dante&#x27;s way of reconstructing himself and his art in terms of his evolving sense of the limitations of courtly love (the system of ritualized love and art that Dante and his poet-friends inherited from the Provençal poets, the Sicilian poets of the court of Frederick II, and the Tuscan poets before them). Sometime in his twenties, Dante decided to try to write love poetry that was less centered on the self and more aimed at love itself. He intended to elevate courtly love poetry, many of its tropes and its language, into sacred love poetry. Beatrice for Dante was the embodiment of this kind of love—transparent to the Absolute, inspiring the integration of desire aroused by beauty with the longing of the soul for divine splendor.

The first full translation into English was published by Joseph Garrow in 1846.

==Structure==
&quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; contains 42 brief chapters (31 for Guglielmo Gorni) with commentaries on 25 sonnets, one &quot;ballata&quot;, and four canzoni; one canzone is left unfinished, interrupted by the death of Beatrice Portinari, Dante&#x27;s lifelong love.

Dante&#x27;s two-part commentaries explain each poem, placing them within the context of his life. The chapters containing poems consist of three parts: the semi-autobiographical narrative, the lyric that resulted from those circumstances, and brief structural outline of the lyric. The poems present a frame story, recounting Dante&#x27;s love of Beatrice from his first sight of her (when both were nine years old) all the way to his mourning after her death, and his determination to write of her &quot;that which has never been written of any woman.&quot;

Each separate section of commentary further refines Dante&#x27;s concept of romantic love as the initial step in a spiritual development that results in the capacity for divine love (see courtly love). Dante&#x27;s unusual approach to his piece — drawing upon personal events and experience, addressing the readers, and writing in Italian rather than Latin — marked a turning point in European poetry, when many writers abandoned highly stylized forms of writing for a simpler style.

== Elements of autobiography ==

Dante wanted to collect and publish the lyrics dealing with his love for Beatrice, explaining the autobiographical context of its composition and pointing out the expository structure of each lyric as an aid to careful reading. The result is an important early example of emotional autobiography, as was Saint Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; in the 5th century. However, like all medieval literature, it is far removed from the modern autobiographical impulse. 

Dante and his audience were also interested in the emotions of courtly love and how they develop, how they are expressed in verse, how they reveal the permanent intellectual truths of the divinely created world and how love can confer blessing on the soul and bring it closer to God.

The names of the people in the poem, including Beatrice herself, are employed without use of surnames or any details that would assist readers to identify them among the many people of Florence. Only the name &quot;Beatrice&quot; is used, because that was both her actual name and her symbolic name as the conferrer of blessing. Ultimately the names and people work as metaphors.

In chapter XXIV, &quot;I Felt My Heart Awaken&quot; &quot;(&quot;Io mi senti&#x27; svegliar dentro a lo core&quot;&quot;, also translated as &quot;I Felt a Loving Spirit Suddenly&quot;), Dante recounts a meeting with Love, who asks the poet to do his best to honour her.
Dante does not name himself in &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;. He refers to Guido Cavalcanti as &quot;the first of my friends&quot;, to his own sister as &quot;a young and noble lady... who was related to me by the closest consanguinity&quot;, to Beatrice&#x27;s brother similarly as one who &quot;was so linked in consanguinity to the glorious lady that no-one was closer to her&quot;. The reader is invited into the very emotional turmoil and lyrical struggle of the unnamed author&#x27;s own mind and all the surrounding people in his story are seen in their relations to that mind&#x27;s quest of encountering Love.

&quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; is helpful for understanding the context of his other works, principally &quot;La Commedia&quot;.

== Influence ==

Besides its content, &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; is notable for being written in Tuscan vernacular, rather than Latin; Dante&#x27;s work helped to establish Tuscan as the basis for the national Italian language.

American poet Wallace Stevens called the text &quot;one of the great documents of Christianity,&quot; noting that the text displays the influence of Christianity in promulgating &quot;the distinctly feminine virtues in place of the sterner ideals of antiquity.&quot;

==Cultural references==
The Henry Holiday painting &quot;Dante and Beatrice&quot; (1883) is inspired by &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, as was Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;The Salutation of Beatrice&quot; (1859). Rossetti translated the work into English in 1848 and used the character name &quot;Monna Vanna&quot; from it as a title for his 1866 painting &quot;Monna Vanna&quot;.

&quot;La vita nuova&quot; is a 1902 cantata based on the text by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari.

Vladimir Martynov&#x27;s 2003 opera &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; premiered in the U.S. on February 28, 2009 at the Alice Tully Hall, performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski.

A modified version of the opening line of the work&#x27;s Introduction was used on the television show &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in the episode &quot;Latent Image&quot; (1999). The Doctor is concerned with a moral situation and Captain Janeway reads this book and leaves the Doctor to discover the poem.

The author Allegra Goodman wrote a short story entitled &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;, published in the May 3, 2010 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, in which Dante&#x27;s words (in English) are interspersed throughout the piece.

<text>The volta (plural: voltas) (Italian: &quot;the turn&quot; or &quot;turning&quot;) is an anglicised name for a dance for couples that was popular during the later Renaissance period. This dance was associated with the galliard and done to the same kind of music. Its main figure consisted of a turn and lift in a sort of closed position, which could be done either to the right or to the left. It is also called La volta, Volta, Volte. Spelling variants include la volta and levolto; its name is &quot;la volte&quot; in French and &quot;la volta&quot; in Italian. It was considered at first to be risque and controversial. Although the dance was known at the court of Elizabeth I, the popular notion (much portrayed in film and television) that Elizabeth and her favourite Lord Robert Dudley regularly performed the volta is unknown as their&#x27;s no evidance to state that they did, or didn&#x27;t. Only opinions.

==Description==
Detailed instructions for voltas were written by Thoinot Arbeau; some brief notes appear in MS Douce 280. (about 1606) These instructions are open to some interpretation, but seem to indicate something like the following.

The dance begins with a galliard. Then the couple makes a transition to a closed position. The leader (the man, according to period custom) lets go of his partner&#x27;s hand and takes hold of her below her busk with one hand, and places the other hand on her back above the far hip. The follower places her near hand on top of her partner&#x27;s near shoulder. Now the leader is facing his partner while she faces to one side; both will do the turn with forward steps, and both step with the same foot at the same time.

The turn begins with a small step, springing onto the outside foot and lifting the inside foot forward. On the second beat there is a longer step, stepping smoothly onto the inside foot and staying close to the ground. During this step the follower poises herself for a spring, and just after it she springs up into the air. The leader lifts her with his hands, then holds her up with his hands and with the thigh of his free leg under her thighs. He lets her down to land on both feet on the last beat of the measure. The couple makes an approximate turn during each measure. The turn is repeated &quot;ad lib&quot; for several measures, and then the galliard is resumed in an open position.

==Relations to other dances==
It is sometimes hypothesized that the volta was the direct ancestor of the waltz. However, with experience, it can be seen from the above instructions (or from Thoinot Arbeau&#x27;s instructions) that the dances are fundamentally different. The volta is more similar to the polska, though there again the differences remain large. The most that might reasonably be assumed is that the development of either the waltz or the polska might have been influenced in some way by the volta.

==References in modern culture==
*An inaccurate example of this dance in the movie &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), where Cate Blanchett (Queen Elizabeth I) and Joseph Fiennes (Lord Robert Dudley) dance it on two occasions.
*A somewhat more accurate version of the volta can be seen in the movie &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), this time with Joseph Fiennes playing William Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow as Viola De Lesseps.
* A very accurate version can be seen in &quot;&quot; (sequel to &quot;Elizabeth&quot;) between Elizabeth &quot;Bess&quot; Throckmorton and Sir Walter Raleigh.
* In the second season&#x27;s seventh episode of Showtime&#x27;s original series &quot;The Tudors&quot;, Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn perform a dance that is said to be a Volta; but is actually a fragment of the Canticles of Holy Mary, a Spanish medieval compliance of religious hymns. 
* A version of volta can be seen performed in the 1953 film &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot;.
* This dance is also performed in the third episode of 1971&#x27;s Elizabeth R, &quot;Shadow in the Sun&quot; between Queen Elizabeth (Glenda Jackson) and Robert Dudley (Robert Hardy).
* On 23 June 2009 the contestants on &quot;Big Brother 10&quot; (UK Channel 4) were given the task to perform The Volta, with the performance shown the following evening.
