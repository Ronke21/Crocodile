<text>Biology is the study of life and its processes. Biologists study all aspects of living things, including &quot;all&quot; of the many life forms on earth and the processes in them that enable life. These basic processes include the harnessing of energy, the synthesis and duplication of the materials that make up the body, the reproduction of the organism and many other functions. Biology, along with chemistry and physics is one of the major disciplines of natural science.

<text>Nitshill () is a district on the south side of Glasgow. It is bordered by South Nitshill to the south, Darnley to the east, Crookston and Roughmussel to the north-west, Hurlet to the west and Househillwood and Priesthill to the north, with the Pollok district and the Silverburn Centre beyond. An area of open ground to the south-west of Nitshill forms the boundary between Glasgow and the town of Barrhead in East Renfrewshire.

Nitshill was originally a coal mining village; the Victoria Colliery in the area was the scene of one of Scotland&#x27;s worst mining disasters on 15 March 1851, in which 61 men and boys died.

==History==
The village fell within the county of Renfrewshire until 1926, when it was incorporated into the City of Glasgow. The change in local government was mainly related to education and community services such as roads, water, sewerage and housing.

Consisting of just a few streets prior to its incorporation into Glasgow, Nitshill grew on a small scale with cottage flats prior to World War II, after which it was substantially expanded to accommodate people relocated during the Glasgow slum clearances in the 1950s and 1960s.
The wider area, sited on the main Glasgow-Kilmarnock road and rail networks and including the post-WWII housing schemes of South Nitshill and Craigbank (as well as Priesthill in some reckonings), became 
increasingly marked by multiple socio-economic issues. However, there has been a move towards improving the district with the regeneration/demolition of much of the housing and schools, and the building of The &quot;Glasgow Museums Resource Centre&quot;, a purpose-built museum storage facility and visitor centre (technically located within South Nitshill) which houses the &quot;Nitshill Open Museum&quot;. There is one small tower block in the area, adjacent to the shopping precinct, the only such structure in that part of Glasgow (over 200 were constructed across the city).

Part of the city&#x27;s Greater Pollok ward, Nitshill is classed as a low socio-economic area. Studies have confirmed a strong association between deprivation and crime. It is no surprise, therefore, to find that the highest rates of crime in residential areas in Glasgow are to be found in the most deprived areas of the city. This link was highlighted in a report relating to a knife murder committed by a bar manager in a Nitshill pub in 2010.

Nitshill railway station is on the Glasgow South Western Line and has a memorial to the former station clerk John Meikle, killed in action in France in 1918, aged 19, and awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The railway line is the southern boundary of Nitshill proper (South Nitshill has a close association with the older part, and residents of the modern developments at Parkhouse further south also make use of the local amenities on Nitshill Road). The northern limit is the Levern Water, where the early 2000s housing estate of Levernbank is situated.

The poet and folk singer Jock Purdon was born and grew up in Nitshill.

== Victoria coal pit disaster ==
On 15 March 1851, an explosion at the Victoria coal pit killed 61 of the 63 men and boys in the mine at the time. Two survivors were rescued 45 hours after the explosion. A memorial to the disaster stands off the main road at Nitshill station, beside the local war memorial.

The plaque reads:
:&quot;NITSHILL MINING DISASTER&quot;
:&quot;15th MARCH 1851&quot;

:&quot;IN MEMORY OF THE NITSHILL MINING DISASTER&quot;
:&quot;AND THE 61 MINERS FROM THE VICTORIA PIT&quot;
:&quot;WHO LOST THEIR LIVES&quot;

:&quot;DONATIONS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY&quot;
:&quot;TRADERS, TRADE UNIONS&quot;
:&quot;AND&quot;
:&quot;GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL&quot;

<doc id="223889" wikidata="Q1781747" url="?curid=223889" title="Twelfth Night (band)">
<text>Twelfth Night are an English neo-prog band of the 1980s, reformed between 2007 and 2012 and again in 2014. The BBC has described them as Reading&#x27;s biggest band of the 1980s.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The seeds of Twelfth Night were sown when guitarist Andy Revell and drummer Brian Devoil joined forces on 23 February 1978 to win a talent competition at Reading University. The road crew included Geoff Mann as backdrop painter, and Rick Battersby as dry ice engineer. Devoil&#x27;s previous musical experience was of various local bands in Reading, including &quot;Trash&quot; with whom he recorded a single &quot;Priorities&quot; released by Polydor in October the previous year. Revell&#x27;s previous bands (in Bournemouth) included &quot;Joe Soap and The Bubbles&quot; and &quot;Abraxas&quot;. Later in 1978, Clive Mitten wandered into a rehearsal and asked for a job. Devoil described Mitten as being very good in creating opportunities, convincing them when he said &quot;you need a bass player&quot;. Mitten had previously played with local bands in Brighton, including Luna Hare.

=== Twelfth Night ===
Following a couple of gigs as the &quot;Andy Revell Band&quot;, the band changed their name to Twelfth Night. In March 1979, the band completed its first recording which resulted in the &#x27;legendary&#x27; Skan demo (Line-up: Devoil, Mitten, Revell). Later, during the Summer, they played one notable gig: a Midsummer Rock Concert at Reading University where friend Mann guested on vocals. After a couple of open-air concerts in the summer, the band retired to Mann&#x27;s parents&#x27; home in Manchester for rehearsals taking Battersby with them. While there they played a gig in Salford to an audience of 10 year olds.

When Battersby and Mann joined the band it was their first musical venture, although Battersby had previously been classically trained in the piano. However, Mann decided to remain in Manchester to paint and work with a close friend, Peter Lawrence, in a two-piece &quot;off the wall&quot; band called the &quot;God Stars&quot;. So Twelfth Night, having decided to forge ahead as an instrumental band, started gigging in earnest early in 1980. These early gigs were mainly pubs in the Home Counties.

=== Coming to notice ===
The band&#x27;s first publicly available material was released in January 1980. This was an album featuring live versions of Fur Helene and Encore along with studio tracks Freddie Hepburn and Sequences. It was only available as a cassette and was named &quot;The First Tape Album&quot;. Their first major breakthrough came when music paper &quot;Musicians Only&quot; voted this tape its &quot;Demo of the Week&quot;. This was followed by an ecstatic gig review and full page article – the band&#x27;s first national press.

To find a vocalist, the band advertised in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and during that summer recruited American singer Electra MacLeod.

Electra added lyrics to a number of previously instrumental pieces, notably &quot;The Cunning Man&quot;, &quot;Abacus&quot;, &quot;Keep The Aspidistra Flying&quot; and &quot;Sequences&quot;. Live recordings of this line-up remain unreleased.

The band, with Electra, recorded a second cassette album (known variously as &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;The Electra Tapes&quot; and &quot;Early Material&quot;) which was released to coincide with an autumn tour. However, this did not work out and Electra left during November 1980. Despite this, a single, jokingly named &quot;The First 7&quot; Album&quot; (TN001) was released that December featuring Electra&#x27;s vocal contribution to &quot;The Cunning Man&quot; and a newly recorded short version of &quot;Fur Helene&quot;.

Following Electra&#x27;s departure the band quickly recorded a live album, &quot;Live at the Target&quot; (TN002). This album was released in February 1981 and was promoted by extensive live dates on a couple of which support was provided by &quot;God Stars&quot;. This tour included the band&#x27;s first gigs at the Marquee Club, London.

=== Success ===
The album &quot;Live at the Target&quot; was recorded over two days in January. This led to a publishing deal with Neptune – signed in March 1981 – and the initial success of the album prompted Pinnacle Records to offer a distribution deal which meant the band had product available nationally for the first time. It appeared in both Heavy Metal and Hippy charts in both Melody Maker and Sounds.

Once again the summer saw them searching for a vocalist. One track recorded with Reading vocalist Ian Lloyd-Jones in May 1981 was intended as a single, but did not materialise.

Eventually they recruited Mann once again and opened the Reading festival in August 1981, being only the second local band to appear at the event (after A.F.T. in 1976 who released one LP on Charisma that same year). Mann&#x27;s own version of Sequences, debuted at Reading, would soon become a live staple and, ultimately, perhaps the best-loved Twelfth Night song.

After this they disappeared into the studio to demo some new songs. Some of the tracks from these demos were released on an LP length tape early in December 1981. Entitled &quot;Smiling at Grief&quot; (TN003) it also included Fur Helene Part II, one of the earliest tracks written in 1978 and not previously released. During this period Battersby left the band to pursue some solo projects. By this time, Live At The Target had also enjoyed significant sales in America, Scandinavia and Europe.

The band spent most of 1982 writing and recording the &quot;Fact and Fiction&quot; (TN006) album. Commenced in May it wasn&#x27;t finally finished and released until December. Mitten doubled on keyboards in Battersby&#x27;s absence and a few gigs were done as a four-piece that autumn.

During the summer, an offer to appear on TV came &quot;out of the blue&quot; and so the band performed East of Eden on the first ever David Essex Showcase. It was screened on BBC1 on 26 June 1982.

Two tracks which didn&#x27;t find room on the Fact and Fiction album, Eleanor Rigby and East of Eden were released on single (REV009) in October 1982. Battersby then rejoined in December 1982, completing the line-up for the Fact and Fiction Tour which began in January 1983 and included the band&#x27;s first headline gig at the Marquee. Bullet &amp; Pinnacle Records took over distribution of the new album.

A new epic track, &quot;The Collector&quot;, was performed and demoed during the first half of 1983.

In August 1983, the band once again performed at the Reading Festival. CBS records seemed poised to offer a recording deal after four demos were recorded for CBS the previous May.

=== Departure of Mann ===
In November 1983, Mann left after two sell-out gigs at the Marquee, which were recorded for a live album, &quot;Live and Let Live&quot;. Mann commenced a solo career, and was replaced by vocalist/songwriter Andy Sears (ex Canis Major, Isis, Rapid Apple, and Silva) in December.

=== Consolidation ===
In January 1984, the band began an extensive period of touring with Andy Sears, coinciding with the release of the Live And let Live LP on the Music For Nations label (Cat. No. MFN18). Highlights included a slot supporting Pallas at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in March and several more gigs at the band&#x27;s second home the Marquee Club – including one which was filmed. This concert went out &quot;live&quot; in several European countries and was recorded for subsequent broadcast in the UK as part of a series: &quot;Live From London&quot;. Twelfth Night&#x27;s performance has never been broadcast, but was later released on video entitled &quot;The Creep Show&quot; and a DVD &quot;Live From London&quot;.

Immediately after touring the band signed a management and publishing deal with Hit and Run Music, joining Genesis and Peter Gabriel amongst others at the company.

While most of summer 1984 was spent preparing new material, including a major new song Take A Look, the band broke cover in July to play their first major London headline at the Dominion Theatre. It was a great success with some 1,500 people attending. In August the band travelled to Liverpool to record the &quot;Art and Illusion&quot; album with Gil Norton (of &quot;Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&quot; fame) producing. Soon after its release in October it reached No. 83 in the national chart. The tour saw the band playing much larger venues than before and included the Dominion Theatre again and what turned out to be their only gig outside the UK, in Marburg, Germany.

1985 started with a couple of special birthday gigs at the Marquee under the pseudonym Jan Six and the Cryptk Clues which sold out in advance through the fan club. Most of the rest of the first half of the year was spent writing new material, some of which was tried out during the Corner of the World tour in May.

It seemed that the band were at last going to get a major record deal when Charisma Records decided to sign them. In July, however, the company went bust. Not dispirited the band played a charity gig (Wycombe Live Aid) followed by three consecutive nights at the Marquee – their 14th, 15th and 16th successive sell-out gigs there.

By September the band had selected the songs for the next album and began pre-production with producer John L. Walters. Recording of the album began November, and in December the band signed a major record deal with Virgin Records, who had by now taken over Charisma. The album was premiered at a special &quot;showcase&quot; concert at the Marquee in April 1986.

In May another special concert, this time at the London Town and Country Club, was filmed by the BBC, with Blue Powder Monkey being subsequently shown on &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. The concert was also recorded for Radio 1, but was not eventually broadcast. In June, Virgin released &quot;Shame&quot; as a single b/w &quot;Blue Powder Monkey&quot;. In July the album &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was released, followed soon after by second single &quot;Take a Look&quot; b/w &quot;Blondon Fair&quot;. Though receiving critical acclaim the overall sales of the album were disappointing, though it went straight in at No. 1 in Reading&#x27;s local chart. Before the end of the year the band once again played Hammersmith Odeon in London.

=== Departure of Sears and Mitten ===
Andy Sears left the band in late 1986, severely disappointed with the complete lack of direction and promotional strategy displayed by Virgin. Sears was replaced by Martyn Watson from Pookah Makes Three. After initial rehearsals as a five-piece, Clive Mitten also left early in 1987 to run a recording studio. The contract with Virgin was terminated shortly after. The band continued briefly as a four-piece with Watson doubling on bass. The last set of songs written by Revell, Devoil, Battersby and Watson received a one-off live airing when the band supported Geoff Mann at one of his Marquee gigs. Following this, Twelfth Night quietly split.

=== Interregnum ===
In 1988, during one of the frequent calls between band members the subject of the unrecorded song The Collector was discussed. Mitten offered studio time, and so in May the &quot;original&quot; line-up (Revell, Devoil, Mitten, Mann and Battersby) reunited to record the song, along with a new version of Love Song. After careful deliberation the band offered a compilation of these and others to M.F.N in the form of the album &quot;Collector&#x27;s Item&quot; which was finally released in early 1991.

Geoff Mann died of cancer in February 1993. In 1996, Andy Sears went to live in Spain, where he became actively involved in various projects, including an appearance at the Tiana festival (Barcelona), originally planned as a Twelfth Night reunion. In 2006, Sears was invited to supply all the backing vocals for a new Galadriel album, Calibrated Collision Course, released in December 2008.

In the period since the band&#x27;s demise, a number of archive live recordings have become officially available from Brian Devoil&#x27;s archives and a new compilation album, &quot;Voices in the Night&quot; was released in 2007.

=== Reunion ===
Quite unexpectedly in June 2007, Clive Mitten and Andy Sears announced a one-off gig performing Twelfth Night material to take place in November 2007. By July, it had been confirmed that they would be billed as Twelfth Night, and in September, a 2nd gig was added and both Andy Revell and Brian Devoil were revealed as part of the line-up, with Mark Spencer (formerly the vocalist in 80s prog band LaHost, Andy Sears&#x27; one time flatmate, and an old friend of the band) replacing Rick Battersby. The band were invited to headline the 10th Tiana Festival in Barcelona in May 2008 – their second only concert outside of the UK, the previous being a concert in Germany in 1984. Additional gigs were added in the UK, and at one of these, Geoff Mann&#x27;s son James was invited by Andy Sears to accompany him on Love Song.

&quot;Play On&quot;, the official history of the band, was published in December 2009, just as the band announced their next gig: as headliners of the Progeny Festival in May 2010. Five other dates were subsequently announced, along with a revised line-up that included Roy Keyworth (guitar) and Dean Baker (keyboards) from the UK band Galahad in place of the unavailable Andy Revell.

In 2010, Twelfth Night were invited to headline the Friday night of the V Night of The Prog festival at Loreley, with Marillion headlining the Saturday night. Despite horrendous technical problems, the band were extremely well received.

&quot;MMX&quot;, a new live double DVD and CD, was released in November 2010 and represents the band&#x27;s first &#x27;new&#x27; material since 1986. Sears toured extensively as a solo artist in 2011.

From 2012 the band effectively split into two: founder members Devoil, Mitten and Revell, with Spencer and Baker, performed several dates as The Cryptic Clues. Spencer also joined Baker and Keyworth as the bassist in Galahad. Meanwhile, Twelfth Night (now with Devoil, Sears, Keyworth, Baker and newcomer Andy Faulkner) performed at the final edition of North East Art Rock Festival in June 2012. This was Sears&#x27; last performance, who confirmed his departure in November 2012 in order to compose new material and pursue other musical projects.

The Cryptic Clues performed a &#x27;farewell&#x27; gig in London in December 2012, preceded by a warm-up gig as special guests at Danfest 2 at the Leicester Musician. The Cryptic Clues line-up was officially billed as Twelfth Night in a one-off gig in London in May 2014.

Devoil, Revell and Spencer, with guests, recorded a new studio version of the band&#x27;s most famous song Sequences in 2018, released on 11 November 2018. This same trio reunited in December 2022 to record a new arrangement of the song Fact and Fiction for the compilation &quot;The Food Of Love&quot;.

<text>Tanacross (also Transitional Tanana) is an endangered Athabaskan language spoken by fewer than 60 people in eastern Interior Alaska.

== Overview ==
The word Tanacross (from &quot;Tanana Crossing&quot;) has been used to refer both to a village in eastern Alaska and to an ethnolinguistic group. The modern village of Tanacross is accessible by a short access road from the Alaska Highway, and some speakers now reside in the regional center of Tok, located approximately ten miles east of the village on the highway. In addition several speakers now reside in the nearest commercial center of Fairbanks, located two hundred miles downstream from Tanacross village and accessible by all-weather highway.
Tanacross is the ancestral language of the Mansfield-Kechumstuk and Healy Lake-Joseph Village bands of Tanana Athabaskan people, whose ancestral territory encompassed an area bounded by the Goodpaster River to the west, the Alaska Range to the south, the Fortymile and Tok rivers to the east, and the Yukon Uplands to the north.

In the late nineteenth century trading posts were established at Tanana Crossing, a ford along the Eagle Trail, directly across the Tanana River from the present-day village of Tanacross. A telegraph station followed in 1902, and an Episcopal mission in 1909. Both the Mansfield-Kechumstuk and Healy Lake-Joseph Village bands eventually settled in Tanana Crossing, eventually shortened to Tanacross (McKennan 1959). The village was relocated across the river to its present location in the early 1970s, and most present-day Tanacross speakers live in or near the village of Tanacross.

==Etymology==
The name Tanacross has only recently been applied to the language and still has limited currency outside academic circles. Many other linguonyms have been used. Wrangell&#x27;s 1839 wordlist refers to the language as the “Copper River Kolchan”, though Wrangell certainly had no notion of the linguistic geography of the Tanacross region. The first extensive ethnographic research in the area was conducted by McKennan in 1929-30, who excludes Tanacross from his map of what he labels as the Upper Tanana region (1959: 16). However, McKennan later appears to lump Tanacross and Upper Tanana together under the label Upper Tanana, noting:
“In considering the Tanana River as a whole, however, the [Tanana] Crossing and Upper Tanana natives should be lumped together, for between the Crossing and Healy River occur a whole series of rapids which today make navigation exceedingly dangerous and in earlier days practically prevented it.” (23)
McKennan mistakenly assumes that the Tanana River was a major transportation corridor, when in fact the various Tanacross bands have never had a true riverine culture, having only settled on the Tanana River in the twentieth century. The rapids referred to by McKennan serve as a barrier to salmon migration and remove a major incentive for river settlement (de Laguna &amp; McClellan 1960). In contrast, land travel in this region is relatively easy, and extensive networks of trails connect the villages of the Tanacross region. Many of these trails are still used for hunting access. And at least until the construction of the Alaska Highway in 1942, foot and sled travel between Healy Lake, Mansfield and Kechumstuk was extremely common (Ellen Demit, p.c.).

Osgood (1936) uses the term Tanana for the entire region of the Tanana River drainage below the Tok River to the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon rivers. Shinen (1958), who recorded a word list from Mary Charlie and Oscar Isaac in Tanacross village, refers to the language as the “Nabesna dialect”, and Shinen&#x27;s term was repeated in Hoijer (1963). Nabesna was actually Osgood&#x27;s preferred term for Upper Tanana, so Shinen appears to have followed McKennan in lumping Tanacross and Upper Tanana together but adopted Osgood&#x27;s linguonym. Shinen&#x27;s list is clearly of Tanacross, not Upper Tanana origin. De Laguna &amp; McClellan (1960) use the term Tanacross language, but only in a restricted sense referring to the language of Tanacross village proper. Krauss originally included Tanacross with Lower Tanana, but after a more extensive linguistic survey of the region in the 1960s, he began using the term “Transitional Tanana”, recognizing the distinction between Tanacross and the remainder of Tanana (Krauss, p.c.). As the significance of this distinction grew to justify a language rather than dialect boundary, the name Tanacross was applied to the Tanacross linguistic region, appearing for example in Krauss’ 1973 survey of the Athabaskan languages. The preferred self-designation for the language is simply “Indian”, though “Native Language” is sometimes used in more formal contexts. The term “Athabaskan” is disliked. The indigenous word neò/aòneg, usually translated as ‘our language’, is also sometimes heard, though this is likely a neologism.

Tanacross is part of a large language/dialect complex, and the Tanacross linguistic region is bordered by several other closely related Athabaskan languages. To the northwest is Han, spoken in Eagle and across the Canada–US border in Dawson and Moosehide. To the east is the language known by the geographic term Upper Tanana, spoken in the villages of Tetlin, Northway, Scottie Creek, Beaver Creek, and (formerly) Chisana. Tanacross and Upper Tanana share a high degree of mutual intelligibility, though the tonal patterns (with the exception of the Tetlin dialect, which is apparently toneless) are reversed. To the south near the headwaters of the Copper River in Mentasta is the Ahtna language. The Mentasta dialect of Ahtna is the most divergent of the four main Ahtna dialects and shares many lexical and phonological features with Tanacross rather than with the other Ahtna dialects. McKennan remarks:
“The Tanana Crossing people have always been in much closer contact with the Indians of Copper River, the valley of the Tok [River] leading to the easy Mentasta Pass and thence down Slana River to the Copper. The Upper Tanana natives maintain that the Crossing dialect is much more similar to that of the Copper River than is their own.” (23)
==Dialectology==
Until very recently Lower Tanana was spoken at Salcha (), just west of the Tanacross language area near the mouth of the Salcha River. As might be expected, Salcha shares many features with Healy Lake, the westernmost dialect of Tanacross, though the two are readily distinguished as separate languages (in particular by the presence of high marked tone in Healy Lake). With the passing of the Salcha dialect, the nearest Lower Tanana villages are located more than one hundred miles downstream at Nenana and Minto, and the linguistic boundary between Tanacross and Lower Tanana is now even more distinct.

The Tanacross linguistic region is geographically small by Alaska Athabaskan standards and hence contains little dialectal variation. A small number of phonological features distinguish two major dialects. The Mansfield ()-Kechumstuk () (MK) dialect of Tanacross ( - ″The Mansfield People&#x27;s Language″, referring to the traditional village of Mansfield (), north of Tanacross) was formerly spoken at Mansfield Lake () and Kechumstuk, until those bands combined and later moved to Tanacross village. This is the dialect spoken in Tanacross village and the dialect upon which this study is based. Unless indicated otherwise reference to Tanacross language should be assumed to mean the MK dialect. A second dialect of Tanacross is spoken by the Healy Lake-Joseph Village bands at Healy Lake () and Dot Lake () to the west, and formerly at Joseph Village, and is linguistically distinguished by the retention of schwa suffixes.

== Status ==
As with all of the Athabaskan languages of Alaska, Tanacross is extremely endangered. Although most children have passive understanding of simple commands and phrases, most fluent speakers of Tanacross are at least fifty years old. Only among the oldest speakers is Tanacross the language of daily communication. Based on the age of the youngest speakers, Krauss (1997) estimates 65 speakers out of a total population of 220. In spite of the relatively small number of speakers, the percentage of speakers out of the total population is quite high for an Alaska Athabaskan language. Outside Tanacross village proper the percentage is much lower. Although 1990 census figures place the combined populations of Dot Lake and Healy Lake at 117, Kari (p.c.) estimates fewer than four speakers at Healy Lake and perhaps two or three at Dot Lake.

In spite of its small size (population 140) and proximity to predominantly non-native community of Tok, Tanacross village maintains its own school, where Tanacross literacy is sometimes taught. In addition, most households in the village contain at least one fluent Tanacross speaker.
Recently there has been an increase in interest in language revitalization, particularly among middle aged adults. A Tanacross Language Workshop was conducted in 1990, and several training sessions were held at the Yukon Native Language Centre in Whitehorse throughout the 1990s. These training sessions resulted in Native Language teaching certification for at least one speaker. Tanacross language classes are planned at the University of Alaska regional center in Tok.

== Phonology ==
Tanacross is one of four Athabaskan tone languages spoken in Alaska. The others are Gwichʼin, Han, and Upper Tanana. Tanacross is the only Alaska Athabaskan language to exhibit high tone as a reflex of Proto-Athabaskan constriction.

=== Vowels ===
There are six phonemic vowels:

The vowels , , , and may be distinguished for length, indicated in the practical orthography by doubling the vowel. The reduced vowel is indicated via the letter . Thus, the practical orthography does not distinguish short from .

Vowels may be marked for high (á), rising (ǎ), falling (â) or extra-high (á́) tone. Low tone is unmarked.

=== Consonants ===
The consonants of the Tanacross practical orthography are shown below. This practical orthography follows standard Athabaskan conventions, in particular, stops and affricates are grouped together phonologically. Also, voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates consonants are indicated using, for the most part, the IPA symbols for voiced consonants, while voiceless aspirated consonants are indicated using the IPA symbols for voiceless consonants. Note that in coda position the unaspirated/aspirated distinction reverts to a voiceless/voiced distinction, providing further motivation for the choice of symbols in the practical orthography.

=== Semi-voiced fricatives ===
One of the distinguishing features of Tanacross is the presence of so-called semi-voiced fricatives, a unique type of segment which appear to begin voiceless and transition to fully voiced. Acoustically, semi-voiced fricatives are characterized by lower intensity of high-frequency frication. Semi-voiced fricatives occur in stem-initial position in lieu of fully voiced fricatives. Even though they are essentially allophonic variants of the voiced fricatives, semi-voiced fricatives are indicated in the practical orthography via an underscore beneath the corresponding voiceless segment.

== Relationship to other languages ==
Tanacross is a member of the Athabaskan family of languages, a well-established genetic grouping whose members occupy three discontinuous areas of North America: the Northern group in northwestern Canada and Alaska, the Pacific Coast in northern California, Oregon, and southern Washington, and the Apachean group in the desert southwest of the continental United States. The seven Apachean languages include Navajo, the largest North American language in terms of number of speakers. Apachean is a very tightly related and well-defined branch. The Pacific Coast group is much less closely related than Apachean and is perhaps more of a geographic subgroup containing perhaps six languages. Of these only Tolowa and Hupa are still spoken today, and these only by a handful of speakers. Of the roughly 24 Northern Athabaskan languages, eleven are spoken in Alaska, three of which straddle the border with Canada.

Given the available data, it is difficult to discern linguistic subgroups within Northern Athabaskan. This is certainly true for the languages of the Tanana River drainages, which form a continuum extending from Lower Tanana in the west (downriver) to Upper Tanana in the east (upriver). Tanacross itself was not defined as a distinct language until the late 1960s (Krauss 1973a). The dialectology of this area has not been completely unraveled, but it is clear that Tanacross of course shares many features with neighboring languages and dialects, especially the Mentasta dialect of Ahtna, the (now extinct) Salcha dialect of Lower Tanana, the Tetlin dialect of Upper Tanana, and the Han language.

However, Tanacross is distinguished most dramatically from neighboring languages by the development of Proto-Athabaskan (PA) constricted vowels into high tone. In contrast, Lower Tanana, Hän and Upper Tanana developed low tone, while Ahtna either did not develop or lost tone. The Tanacross tone system remains active in the phonology and morphology of the language. Tanacross shares close linguistic, geographical and social ties with Upper Tanana to the east. In fact, the close social ties which have bound Tanacross with other groups in the upper Tanana drainage area argue for the definition of a Tanana Uplands language and culture area. This area would include all groups which have regularly participated in potlatch ceremonies with Tanacross, including the Upper Tanana of Tetlin, Northway and Beaver Creek; the Han of the vicinity of Eagle, Alaska and Dawson City, Yukon; and the Mentasta Ahtna of the Mentasta area. Mentasta is the most divergent dialect of Ahtna and shares many linguistic features with Tanacross and Upper Tanana. Due to extensive multilingualism within the Tanana Uplands area, any study of Tanacross must account for the larger socio-linguistic framework within which Tanacross is embedded.

== Early research ==
In addition to the strictly linguistic resources to be discussed below, Isaac (1988) and Simeone (1995) provide important cultural background on the Tanacross community. The former is an oral history told by Chief Andrew Isaac, the last traditional chief of Tanacross. Though much of the text has been translated into English, the translation maintains much of the speech style of the original Tanacross language. The text contains many references to Tanacross flora and fauna, as well as cultural items. Simeone&#x27;s book is an ethnographic sketch written by an Episcopal lay worker who spent much of the 1970s living in Tanacross village. Ethnographies of the eastern Alaska Athabaskan region, though not specific to Tanacross, can be found in McKennan (1959) and Andrews (1975). De Laguna &amp; McClellan&#x27;s (1960) field notes also contain extensive ethnographic information.

The earliest written record by far of the Tanacross language is the “Copper River Kolchan” vocabulary recorded in Wrangell (1839). This list was probably collected at Nuchek in Prince William Sound, but its character is unmistakably Tanacross. Another short (three typescript pages) word list was collected by J.T. Geoghegan (Geoghegan &amp; Geoghegan 1904). David Shinen compiled a somewhat longer Tanacross word list from Mary Charlie and Oscar Isaac in Tanacross village, and a portion of this list was later published under the heading “Nabesna” in Hoijer (1963). More substantive documentation of Tanacross began with exploratory fieldwork by Krauss, who first called it “transitional Tanana”. In the early 1970s Nancy McRoy compiled some textual materials with speaker Mary Charlie and a short wordlist containing about 400 items, mostly nouns, as well as some basic literacy materials. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Jeff Leer compiled further notes on grammatical paradigms and phonological features, including the three-way fricative voicing contrast. Marilyn Paul (1978) presents some notes compiled from a class taught by Leer at ANLC. Ron Scollon transcribed and translated a collection of texts from speaker Gaither Paul using a revised orthography which indicates tone. Kari has compiled a preliminary stem list based on information collected from several speakers in the 1980s, but tone is not marked. Alice Brean has compiled lexical and paradigmatic information. Minoura has compiled a short word list and information on tone. In spite of the various sources of lexical documentation, Krauss (p.c.) estimates than only twenty percent of the extant body of lexical information has been documented by linguists.

During the early 1990s John Ritter of the Yukon Native Language Center (YNLC) began a comprehensive study of Tanacross phonology in the early 1990s and developed a practical orthography. Tanacross speakers Irene Solomon Arnold and Jerry Isaac have participated in literacy workshops in Tok, Whitehorse and Dawson City, resulting in the production of literacy materials with accompanying cassette tapes. Solomon &amp; Ritter (1997) provides crucial data for the description of tone phenomena. Phonology and morphology are described in Holton&#x27;s 2000 University of California Santa Barbara dissertation. Semi-voiced fricatives are described by Holton (2001). The interaction of tone and intonation is described in Holton (2005). Additional sound recordings and field notes are available at YNLC and the Alaska Native Language Archive. Since 2000 Irene Solomon has worked as a language specialist at the Alaska Native Language Center and has collaborated on a number of projects with linguist Gary Holton, including a phrase book, a learners&#x27; dictionary, and a multimedia description of the sound system.

<text>Peter John Hollingworth, (born 10 April 1935) is an Australian retired Anglican bishop. Engaged in social work for several decades, he served as the archbishop of the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane in Queensland for 11 years from 1989 and was the 1991 Australian of the Year. He served as the 23rd governor-general of Australia from 2001 until 2003. He is also an author and recipient of various civil and ecclesiastical honours. In May 2003 Hollingworth became the third Australian governor-general to resign, after criticisms were aired over his conduct as Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane in the 1990s.

==Early life==
Hollingworth was born on 10 April 1935 in Adelaide, South Australia. He is the son of Rosalind () and John Hollingworth. His father, an engineer, grew up in British India and moved to Australia after the First World War. His mother was from &quot;one of South Australia&#x27;s pioneering families&quot;.

In 1941, Hollingworth and his family moved to Melbourne, where his father had been recruited to join the Department of Aircraft Production. The family settled in the suburb of East Malvern and he began his education at Lloyd Street State School and Murrumbeena State School. He went on to attend Scotch College, Melbourne. Hollingworth left school at the age of 16 and began a cadetship in the share registry department of mining company BHP, studying accounting at night school.

==Education and career==
Hollingworth was conscripted for national service in 1953 and, after basic training at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Point Cook, he began working in the chaplain&#x27;s office and discerned a vocation to ordained ministry. After matriculating in 1954 he enrolled at the University of Melbourne, residing at Trinity College as a member of its school of theology. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1958 and a Licentiate of Theology in 1959.

On 6 February 1960, Hollingworth married Kathleen Ann Turner, an obstetric physiotherapist, whom he had met while on National Service. The couple have three daughters.

Hollingworth was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1960. He became deacon-in-charge and then priest-in-charge of St Mary&#x27;s North Melbourne, in a group ministry of the Anglican Inner City Mission within the Melbourne Diocesan Centre. In 1964 he joined the Brotherhood of St Laurence, an independent Anglican welfare organisation, as chaplain and director of youth and children&#x27;s work, then as director of social policy and research. He completed a master&#x27;s degree in social work and in 1980 was appointed executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, where he served for 25 years and was involved in other associated community and welfare bodies.

Hollingworth wrote several books about his work with the poor which became educational texts. As a public advocate on welfare policy he argued that &quot;poverty should be looked at in terms of the structure of society rather than the individual case.&quot;

Hollingworth was elected a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1980 and became the Bishop in the Inner City upon his consecration, 24 February 1985.

In 1989, Hollingworth was elected the 8th Archbishop of Brisbane, where he continued his advocacy for the poor and underprivileged and supported the ordination of women.

Hollingworth was chairman of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless National NGO Committee and was named Australian of the Year for 1991, being described as &quot;Australia&#x27;s foremost spokesman for social justice&quot;. He used his public profile to criticise government policy in relation to Aboriginal welfare and youth unemployment.

In 1998, he attended as an appointed delegate to the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention.

==Governor-General of Australia==

On 22 April 2001 the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, announced that Queen Elizabeth II had accepted his advice to appoint Hollingworth as Governor-General of Australia upon the completion of Sir William Deane&#x27;s term. He was the first Christian cleric to hold the post, though precedent existed at a state level where Aboriginal pastor Sir Doug Nicholls and Uniting Church minister Sir Keith Seaman had served as Governor of South Australia and Davis McCaughey had served as Governor of Victoria. On 29 June 2001, Hollingworth was sworn in as Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Force. As the governor-general is the chancellor and principal companion of the Order of Australia, Hollingworth was appointed a companion of the order (AC) on 29 June 2001.

===Resignation===
In December 2001, allegations were raised that, during his time as Archbishop of Brisbane, Hollingworth had failed to deal appropriately with sex abuse allegations made against a church teacher at Toowoomba Preparatory School. That month, the Brisbane Anglican diocese was ordered to pay $834,800 damages to the woman who had been found to have been sexually abused. Hetty Johnston, an advocate for child sex abuse victims, instigated a campaign calling for Hollingworth to resign. Hollingworth told the Australian media that, as a newly appointed archbishop at the time, he lacked the experience to handle the matter. He also said he had not believed that the case involved sexual abuse, but conceded he had not done enough to stop abuses occurring. Hollingworth subsequently apologised to the Toowoomba victim and released a formal statement condemning child sexual abuse but by February 2002, the Labor Opposition was calling for Hollingworth to be dismissed. Hollingworth stepped down from his positions as the Brisbane Lions&#x27; No 1 ticket holder, patron of Barnardo&#x27;s, Kids First Foundation and the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.

Phillip Aspinall, Hollingworth&#x27;s successor as archbishop, ordered an inquiry, which concluded that in 1993 Hollingworth had allowed a known paedophile to continue working as a priest. In May 2003, the report by the Diocese of Brisbane into the handling of the cases was tabled in the Queensland parliament by Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie. On 8 May, Hollingworth issued a public statement denying allegations that he had raped a woman in the 1960s. Both the deputy prime minister, John Anderson, and the treasurer, Peter Costello, indicated in early May that Hollingworth should consider his position. After meeting with Howard on 11 May, Hollingworth stood aside. On 28 May 2003, he announced his resignation and his commission as governor-general was revoked as of 29 May 2003. Hollingworth has received a pension and other entitlements since then.

==Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse==
In 2015–2016, Hollingworth faced questions as part of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in regards to his handling of abuse claims while he was Archbishop of Brisbane. He has apologised to victims for not pursuing their claims more rigorously. Like all Anglican clergy, Hollingworth holds a Working With Children Check clearance. There was a case to defrock Hollingworth (through the Anglican church&#x27;s complaints process) over allowing an &quot;incurable&quot; pedophile to remain in his position for 5 years after becoming aware of his abuse of children. Although the tribunal made several findings of misconduct, it described Hollingworth as &quot;fit for ministry&quot; and recommended he be kept on as a priest, provided Hollingworth apologised and was reprimanded. Hollingworth said in May 2023 that he would cease practising as an Anglican priest. In 2023, the Victorian government investigated whether Hollingworth was fit to retain a Working With Children Check clearance, although Hollingworth&#x27;s lawyer stated that Hollingworth had not worked with children for some time.

==Honours==
In 1976, Hollingworth was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and in 1988 he was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his work in church and community. In 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal and later the same year was promoted to companion of the Order of Australia (AC) upon his appointment as Governor-General taking effect. As well as these secular honours he was elected as a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1980. In 1991 he was named Australian of the Year and was included in the inaugural list of Australian Living Treasures in 1997.

On 21 May 2001, Hollingworth was awarded the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Letters (DLitt) by George Carey, the then Archbishop of Canterbury. He was awarded the doctorate in recognition of his research, publications, teaching and achievements in the fields of Christian social ethics, social welfare and poverty studies and episcopal leadership. In addition to this doctorate he already had six honorary doctorates from Australian universities.

<doc id="223896" wikidata="Q7014754" url="?curid=223896" title="New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division">
<text>The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York is the intermediate appellate court in New York State. The state is geographically divided into four judicial departments of the Appellate Division. The full title of each is, using the &quot;Fourth Department&quot; as an example, the &quot;Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department&quot;.

==Jurisdiction==
The Appellate Division primarily hears appeals from the state&#x27;s superior courts (Supreme Court, Surrogate&#x27;s Court, Family Court, Court of Claims, the county courts) in civil cases, the Supreme Court in criminal cases, and, in the Second, Third, and Fourth Judicial Departments, from the county courts in felony criminal cases. In addition, in civil cases it may hear appeals from the appellate terms of the Supreme Court when these courts have heard appeals from one of the lower trial courts.

New York&#x27;s rules of civil procedure allow for interlocutory appeals of right from nearly every order and decision of the trial court, meaning that most may be appealed to the appropriate appellate department while the case is still pending in the trial court.

The Appellate Division may make decisions of law and fact with respect to its power to hear first appeals from state trial courts, including the Supreme Court and County Courts. These trial level courts exercise specific jurisdiction as conferred by law. In contrast, both the New York Court of Appeals and the Appellate Division, when it sits as a final appeals court with respect to appeals arising from decisions of the Appellate Terms in the First and Second Departments, generally may only decide questions of law. The Appellate Division may adjudicate facts subject to specific constraints in the course of initial review of agency decisions under New York&#x27;s CPLR Article 78, which provides for limited court review or agency and corporate decisions.

Decisions of the Appellate Division departments are binding on the lower courts in that department, and also on lower courts in other departments unless there is contrary authority from the Appellate Division of that department. If two different departments have made different rulings on the same issue, then the lower courts in each departmental area must follow the ruling made by their respective department. This can sometimes result in the same law being applied differently in different departments. When this occurs, the highest court in the state, the Court of Appeals, can remedy the situation by hearing the case and issuing a single ruling, which is then binding on every court in the state. Every opinion, memorandum, and motion of the Appellate Division sent to the New York State Reporter of the New York State Law Reporting Bureau is required to be published in the &quot;Appellate Division Reports&quot;. Opinions of the appellate terms are published selectively in the &quot;Miscellaneous Reports&quot;.

==Organization==

===Departments===
*The First Department, seated in Manhattan, covers both The Bronx (Bronx County) and Manhattan (New York County). Justice Dianne Renwick has been the department&#x27;s Presiding Justice since June 21, 2023.
*The Second Department, seated in Brooklyn, covers Queens (Queens County), Brooklyn (Kings County), Staten Island (Richmond County), Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk counties) and Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester counties. This department is the largest by population. Justice Hector LaSalle has been the Presiding Justice since May 25, 2021.
*The Third Department, seated in Albany, includes an area extending from the territory of the Second Department north to New York&#x27;s borders with Vermont and Quebec, and includes the cities of Albany, Troy, Schenectady, Saratoga Springs, and Binghamton. This territory extends nearly as far west as Syracuse. Hon. Elizabeth A. Garry has been the Presiding Justice since January 1, 2018.
*The Fourth Department, seated in Rochester, covers the remainder of the state west of the Third Department&#x27;s territory, and includes the cities of Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. Hon. Gerald J. Whalen has been the Presiding Justice since January 7, 2016.

===Programs and agencies===
====Attorneys and Counselors at Law====
In addition to hearing appeals in matters of law and equity, the Appellate Division regulates the admission of lawyers to the Bar and their conduct and discipline.
* Each department has a Character and Fitness Committee, whose members interview applicants in person for admission to the bar.
* Each department has Attorney Grievance Committees that investigates complaints of attorney misconduct and may issue reprimands or recommend censure, suspension, or disbarment to the Appellate Division.

====Protection of minors and the incapacitated ====
At English common law, the Lord Chancellor, as the king&#x27;s delegate to exercise the Crown&#x27;s special jurisdiction, had responsibility for the custody and protection of infants and the mentally incapacitated. Revisions to the constitution in 1847 abolished the New York Court of Chancery and transferred this role to the New York Supreme Court.
* The Appellate Division regulates the panels of attorneys that represent children in family law proceedings in the appellate, Supreme, Family and Criminal Courts, and each department has an Office for Attorneys for Children (Originally named Law Guardian).
* Each department also has a Mental Hygiene Legal Service (MHLS) program. Since its creation by statute in 1964 as the Mental Health Information Service, the MHLS has served as the watchdog of the rights of the institutionalized mentally disabled in New York and has been recognized by the courts as essential to the state&#x27;s statutory &quot;protective shield of checks and balances&quot; governing the admission, transfer and retention of psychiatric patients.
* Court Examiners are designated by each department to ascertain whether guardians appointed pursuant to the Mental Hygiene Law have complied with the order of appointment and have performed the duties specified.

==Procedure==
Each case is decided by a panel of five, or in some instances four, justices of the Court. There is no procedure for the Court to sit en banc.

Some basic rules governing appeals are found in Articles 55 and 57 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, but they are not detailed enough to fully provide for a comprehensive system of appellate procedure. Prior to September 2018, and unlike other states that have statewide rules of appellate procedure, there was no set of appellate procedure rules shared by all four departments beyond the rudimentary set in the CPLR. Instead, each of the four departments filled in the CPLR&#x27;s gaps by promulgating its own individual set of rules governing more specific details of practice before that court. The result was considerable diversity in appellate procedure between the four departments, which extended to matters as basic as the form and formatting of appellate briefs, the deadline to perfect an appeal after filing of the notice of appeal, appellate motions, and oral argument.

During the 2010s, this problem was studied at length by the New York State Bar Association, and the NYSBA&#x27;s recommendations for reform came to the attention of Chief Judge Janet DiFiore. In June 2018, the Presiding Justices of the Appellate Division promulgated statewide Practice Rules of the Appellate Division, which became effective in September 2018 and are codified outside of the CPLR in 22 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 1250. The four departments retain the ability to supplement and even supersede the uniform rules by promulgating rules of their own.

===Appeals from the Appellate Division===
Decisions by the Appellate Division may be appealed to the state&#x27;s highest court, the New York Court of Appeals. In some cases, an appeal lies of right, but in most cases, permission (or &quot;leave&quot;) to appeal must be obtained, either from the Appellate Division itself or from the Court of Appeals. In civil cases, the Appellate Division panel or Court of Appeals votes on petitions for leave to appeal; in most criminal cases, however, the petition for leave to appeal is referred to a single Justice or Judge, whose decision whether to grant or deny leave is final.

===Case management===
To keep caseloads under control, most Appellate Division opinions are extremely concise. Often, an Appellate Division panel will dispose of an entire case in only two paragraphs, with the second paragraph stating: &quot;We have considered plaintiff&#x27;s (or defendant&#x27;s) remaining contentions and find them unavailing.&quot; In contrast, courts in most other states traditionally devote a few more paragraphs to disposing of the other &quot;remaining contentions.&quot;

==Appointment of justices==
Justices of the Appellate Division are chosen by the Governor from among those elected to the State Supreme Court. A justice does not have to have been elected from one of the judicial districts within a department to be appointed to the Appellate Division for that department, although the Presiding Justice and a majority of the total number of justices are to reside within the department. They serve at least five years, or until the completion of their 14-year elected terms, or reaching the constitutional age limit of 70, beyond which the governor may choose to reappoint them for up to three two-year terms.

The State Constitution provides that the First and Second Department are each to comprise seven justices, and the Third and Fourth departments five justices. In addition to these &quot;constitutional&quot; justices, the presiding justice of each department may ask the Governor to designate &quot;additional justices&quot; where needed based on the court&#x27;s workload. At present, for example, the First Department comprises 20 justices in total when there are no vacancies. The qualifications for additional Justices are the same as for other justices.

==Administration of the courts==
Attorneys are admitted to the New York bar by one of the Appellate Division departments rather than by New York&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Appeals, though once admitted to any of the Appellate Division departments, such attorney is admitted to practice and appear before all non-federal courts in the state, including the Court of Appeals. Applicants must be interviewed in person by a member of the court&#x27;s &quot;Character and Fitness Committee&quot; after passing the New York State Bar Exam (since July 2016, the Uniform Bar Examination) and Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination administered by the New York State Board of Law Examiners. Applicants are admitted in the department in which they reside; applicants residing outside New York are admitted through the Third Department in Albany.

Judges are regulated by the &quot;Rules Governing Judicial Conduct&quot; promulgated by the Chief Administrator, the &quot;Code of Judicial Conduct&quot; adopted by the New York State Bar Association, and the relevant rules of the respective Appellate Division departments. Attorneys are regulated by various state laws, the &quot;Rules of Professional Conduct&quot; (based on the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct), and rules adopted by each department of the Appellate Division. Each department of the Appellate Division has a committee that investigates complaints of attorney misconduct and may issue reprimands or recommend censure, suspension, or disbarment to the Appellate Division.

==History==
The Appellate Division was created by the New York State Constitution of 1894 to succeed the General Term of the Supreme Court, effective January 1, 1896.

<doc id="223898" wikidata="Q2323664" url="?curid=223898" title="Industrial ecology">
<text>Industrial ecology (IE) is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems. The global industrial economy can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the Earth and transform those resources into by-products, products and services which can be bought and sold to meet the needs of humanity. Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function. Industrial ecologists are often concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the environment, with use of the planet&#x27;s supply of natural resources, and with problems of waste disposal. Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of engineering, economics, sociology, toxicology and the natural sciences.

Industrial ecology has been defined as a &quot;systems-based, multidisciplinary discourse that seeks to understand emergent behavior of complex integrated human/natural systems&quot;. The field approaches issues of sustainability by examining problems from multiple perspectives, usually involving aspects of sociology, the environment, economy and technology. The name comes from the idea that the analogy of natural systems should be used as an aid in understanding how to design sustainable industrial systems.

== Overview ==

Industrial ecology is concerned with the shifting of industrial process from linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes can become inputs for new processes.

Much of the research focuses on the following areas:
* material and energy flow studies (&quot;industrial metabolism&quot;)
* dematerialization and decarbonization
* technological change and the environment
* life-cycle planning, design and assessment
* design for the environment (&quot;eco-design&quot;)
* extended producer responsibility (&quot;product stewardship&quot;)
* eco-industrial parks (&quot;industrial symbiosis&quot;)
* product-oriented environmental policy
* eco-efficiency

Industrial ecology seeks to understand the way in which industrial systems (for example a factory, an ecoregion, or national or global economy) interact with the biosphere. Natural ecosystems provide a metaphor for understanding how different parts of industrial systems interact with one another, in an &quot;ecosystem&quot; based on resources and infrastructural capital rather than on natural capital. It seeks to exploit the idea that natural systems do not have waste in them to inspire sustainable design.

Along with more general energy conservation and material conservation goals, and redefining related international trade markets and product stewardship relations strictly as a service economy, industrial ecology is one of the four objectives of Natural Capitalism. This strategy discourages forms of amoral purchasing arising from ignorance of what goes on at a distance and implies a political economy that values natural capital highly and relies on more instructional capital to design and maintain each unique industrial ecology.

==History==

Industrial ecology was popularized in 1989 in a &quot;Scientific American&quot; article by Robert Frosch and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos. Frosch and Gallopoulos&#x27; vision was &quot;why would not our industrial system behave like an ecosystem, where the wastes of a species may be resource to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on waste treatment?&quot; A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of Kalundborg. Here several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself. Another example is the Rantasalmi EIP in Rantasalmi, Finland. While this country has had previous organically formed EIP&#x27;s, the park at Rantasalmi is Finland&#x27;s first planned EIP.

The scientific field of industrial ecology has grown quickly. The Journal of Industrial Ecology (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology (since 2004) give Industrial Ecology a strong and dynamic position in the international scientific community. Industrial ecology principles are also emerging in various policy realms such as the idea of the circular economy. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. The hope is that strategies such as this will create a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.

==Examples==
The Kalundborg industrial park is located in Denmark. This industrial park is special because companies reuse each other&#x27;s waste (which then becomes by-products). For example, the Energy E2 Asnæs Power Station produces gypsum as a by-product of the electricity generation process; this gypsum becomes a resource for the BPB Gyproc A/S which produces plasterboards. This is one example of a system inspired by the biosphere-technosphere metaphor: in ecosystems, the waste from one organism is used as inputs to other organisms; in industrial systems, waste from a company is used as a resource by others.

Apart from the direct benefit of incorporating waste into the loop, the use of an eco-industrial park can be a means of making renewable energy generating plants, like Solar PV, more economical and environmentally friendly. In essence, this assists the growth of the renewable energy industry and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.

Additional examples of industrial ecology include:
*Substituting the fly ash byproduct of coal burning practices for cement in concrete production
*Using second generation biofuels. An example of this is converting grease or cooking oil to biodiesels to fuel vehicles.
*South Africa&#x27;s National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC) was created in order to make the region&#x27;s industries more efficient in terms of materials. Results of the use of sustainable methods will include lowered energy costs and improved waste management. The program assesses existing companies to implement change.
*Onsite non-potable water reuse
*Biodegradable plastic created from polymerized chicken feathers, which are 90% keratin and account for over 6 million tons of waste in the EU and US annually. As agricultural waste, the chicken feathers are recycled into disposable plastic products which are then easily biodegraded into soil. 
*Toyota Motor Company channels a portion of the greenhouse gases emitted back into their system as recovered thermal energy.
*Anheuser-Busch signed a memorandum of understanding with biochemical company Blue Marble to use brewing wastes as the basis for its &quot;green&quot; products.
*Enhanced oil recovery at Petra Nova.
*Reusing cork from wine bottles for use in shoe soles, flooring tiles, building insulation, automotive gaskets, craft materials, and soil conditioner.
*Darling Quarter Commonwealth Bank Place North building in Sydney, Australia recycles and reuses its wastewater.
*Plant based plastic packaging that is 100% recyclable and environmentally friendly.
*Food waste can be used for compost, which can be used as a natural fertilizer for future food production. Additionally, food waste that has not been contaminated can be used to feed those experiencing food insecurity.
*Hellisheiði geothermal power station uses ground water to produce electricity and hot water for the city of Reykjavik. Their carbon byproducts are then injected back into the Earth and calcified, leaving the station with a net zero carbon emission.

==Future directions==
The ecosystem metaphor popularized by Frosch and Gallopoulos has been a valuable creative tool for helping researchers look for novel solutions to difficult problems. Recently, it has been pointed out that this metaphor is based largely on a model of classical ecology, and that advancements in understanding ecology based on complexity science have been made by researchers such as C. S. Holling, James J. Kay, and further advanced in terms of contemporary ecology by others. For industrial ecology, this may mean a shift from a more mechanistic view of systems, to one where sustainability is viewed as an emergent property of a complex system. To explore this further, several researchers are working with agent based modeling techniques.

Exergy analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently. The term &quot;exergy&quot; was coined by Zoran Rant in 1956, but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and energetics.

<text>Chris Copulos (born 1986 or 1987), better known by his stage name Muscles, is an Australian electronica musician. Muscles&#x27; debut album &quot;Guns Babes Lemonade&quot; was released in Australia on 29 September 2007. The album entered the Australian ARIA Album Chart at No. 14 on 8 October 2007, reaching No. 3 on the Australian Artist Chart and No. 1 on the Dance Album Chart in its first week.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Muscles self-released &quot;Four Months&quot; in early 2006, a compilation of 20 lo-fi experimental/dance/ambient songs burned on 80 handmade CD-Rs, whilst playing various open mic nights in Melbourne. Muscles&#x27;s first single &quot;One Inch Badge Pin&quot; gained small radio play on Australian national youth radio Triple J in July 2006. Playing various indie nights and club shows between Melbourne, Muscles supported Girl Talk in Melbourne and Sydney and performed New Year&#x27;s Eve at Honkytonks &#x27;The Last Dance&#x27; closing down party.

2007 began with a concert at Sydney Festival alongside Midnight Juggernauts, Ajax and Gus Da Hoodrat. A week later Muscles was chosen as the support for Hot Chip&#x27;s Melbourne Big Day Out sideshow. A special one-off performance was organised in February at Click Click (in Brown Alley), arranging 10 musicians from local indie bands in Melbourne to come together and play four songs in a 10 piece superstar improv-band to a mixed response. February included gigs at St. Kilda Festival, main support for Jenny Wilson&#x27;s Australian tour, parties in Sydney at Bandits and Bad Kids Recreation Club. Late February Modular threw a launch party for their new compilation &#x27;Leave Them All Behind 2&#x27; at Bondi Beach, the night included DJ sets from Van She Tech and Bang Gang DJs and Muscles was asked to play live.

In March he opened the first ever Golden Plains Festival (sister to the popular Meredith Music Festival, Australia&#x27;s biggest non-commercial festival). Three weeks later was Australia&#x27;s first ever V Festival, Muscles was not on the line-up but was added last minute a night before due to a band cancelling, already booked to play the official afterparty there were three shows that day including a DJ set at Club 77. Muscles met Soulwax/2manydjs at the V festival afterparty where he was asked to support them on an 11 date North American tour in April for their US release of &quot;Nite Versions&quot;.

Muscles returned to Australia in May, supporting Architecture in Helsinki on their east coast tour including an all ages show at The Metro in Sydney.

Muscles spent a month in London between May and June playing club nights and parties. The debut album Guns Babes Lemonade (completed in February) was mastered at The Exchange during this time. Highlights of the tour include supporting Robyn in Camden, supporting Soulwax in an underground railway, playing the O2 Wireless Festival afterparty in London and the O2 Wireless Festival in Leeds. Amongst gigs in London, Leeds, Bristol, Brighton and Nottingham, the tour also included a gig in Rome with The Presets (that Motörhead attended after their concert with Iron Maiden that night) and a Modular Party in Paris at Maxim&#x27;s restaurant.

In August, Muscles played at the Splendour in the Grass festival, a few days later travelling to Japan with Cut Copy, The Presets and The Bang Gang DJs, to play two shows at Womb and Summersonic Festival Modular Midnight Stage.

Mid-August saw the release of &quot;Ice Cream&quot; and &quot;Sweaty&quot;, a double A-side Australian CD single on Modular. &quot;Ice Cream&quot; had been a radio-only single since March, due to Triple J and community radio stations around the country picking it up 6 months before Muscles had a record deal.

===&quot;Guns Babes Lemonade&quot;===
He performed on the Parklife national festival tour in September alongside Justice, M.I.A., Digitalism and MSTRKRFT. The debut album &quot;Guns Babes Lemonade&quot; was released in Australia during this tour. Muscles did a two-week North American club tour in October to promote the US release of the album. In November and December, he played his first headline tour of Australia including 3 Melbourne shows at the Corner Hotel, Adelaide&#x27;s Rocket Bar, Family in Brisbane, and an all-ages show at The Forum in Sydney. The tour also included festivals in Newcastle, New South Wales and Canberra, a Myspace Secret Show in Coffs Harbour and the biggest Australian-only music festival Homebake. December 2007 saw Muscles on the support bill for the inaugural Nevereverland festival, headlined by Daft Punk. He was again booked for the festival&#x27;s 2008 edition, but was taken off the bill mid-tour due to rifts with label Modular, taking to MySpace to vent his frustrations. 
He missed the Meredith Music Festival due to illness. As of 13 December 2007, his album had reached No. 3 on the CMJ RPM (Electronic) charts in the US. New Year&#x27;s Eve highlights included playing an abandoned cinema complex in Melbourne with Felix Da Housecat, Spank Rock and Chromeo. Muscles also supported Felix Da Housecat in Sydney on New Year&#x27;s Day after playing BBQ Breaks in Brisbane that afternoon.

In 2008, Muscles was one of the headline acts at the Southbound Festival in Busselton, Western Australia along with Groove Armada, Kings of Leon and others. In February, he was asked to play the Good Vibrations Festival in Sydney and also gained the main live support for the Chemical Brothers&#x27; Australian tour. In February announced he would embark on a 17-date Australian tour to promote the single &quot;The Lake&quot;, which was released in release late April 2008. An encore show in Melbourne was added due to popularity in his hometown, and a third Perth show also after Perth and Fremantle shows sold out. With 14 shows selling out it proved to be a record breaking tour for an emerging Australian artist. Muscles unorthodox performance at the 2008 Meredith Music Festival included him disappearing behind stage with his wireless microphone and repeatedly yelling &quot;You can&#x27;t see me!&quot; to a confused audience.

Muscles&#x27; singles &quot;Ice Cream&quot; and &quot;Sweaty&quot; appeared in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2007 at Nos. 14 and 76 respectively.

===Acoustic===
Muscles&#x27; acoustic piano rendition of &quot;Ice Cream&quot; reached No. 45 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008, on 26 January 2009, Australia Day.

===&quot;Younger &amp; Immature&quot; EP===
A press release on 7 September 2010 from Modular/Universal Australia announced a five-track EP entitled &quot;Younger &amp; Immature&quot; and lead single &quot;Girl Crazy Go&quot;, released in late October 2010.

===&quot;Koala&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;ll Follow You&quot;===
The double A-side single &quot;Koala&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow You&quot; was released by Modular 1 July 2011. It was released to promote Muscles&#x27; second album.

<doc id="223902" wikidata="Q1348177" url="?curid=223902" title="Klute">
<text>Klute is a 1971 American neo-noir psychological thriller film directed and produced by Alan J. Pakula and starring Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Charles Cioffi, Nathan George, Dorothy Tristan, Roy Scheider and Rita Gam. Its plot follows a high-priced New York City call girl who assists a detective from Pennsylvania in solving the missing person case of a john who may be stalking her. It is the first installment of what has informally come to be known as Pakula&#x27;s &quot;paranoia trilogy&quot;, followed by &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974) and &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), all films dealing with themes of paranoia, conspiracies and surveillance.

The original screenplay for &quot;Klute&quot; was written by brothers Andy and Dave Lewis, with Andy drawing inspiration from a serial he read as a child about a man attempting to solve his brother&#x27;s murder in a city.

==Plot==
After Pennsylvania chemical company executive Tom Gruneman disappears, the police find an obscene letter in Gruneman&#x27;s office addressed to a New York City call girl named Bree Daniels, who had received several such letters. After six months of fruitless police work, Peter Cable, a fellow executive at Gruneman&#x27;s company, hires family friend and detective John Klute to investigate Gruneman&#x27;s disappearance.

Klute rents an apartment in the basement of Bree&#x27;s building, taps her phone and follows her as she turns tricks. Bree appears to enjoy the freedom of freelancing as a call girl while auditioning for acting and modeling jobs, but she reveals the emptiness of her life to her psychiatrist. Bree refuses to answer Klute&#x27;s questions at first. After learning that he has been watching her, Bree says that she does not recognize Gruneman. She acknowledges having been beaten up by a john two years earlier, but cannot identify Gruneman from a photo. She further admits to Klute that she is a nervous and paranoid person. Bree takes Klute to meet her former pimp Frank Ligourin, who had managed Jane McKenna, a prostitute who had referred the abusive client to Bree. McKenna has apparently committed suicide and their other colleague Arlyn Page has since become a drug addict and disappeared.

Klute and Bree develop a romance, although she tells her psychiatrist that she wishes their relationship would end because she felt more in control of herself when turning tricks. She tells Klute that she is paranoid that she is being watched. They find Page, who tells them that the photo of Gruneman is not that of the client, who was an older man. Page&#x27;s body is later found in the river. Klute connects the apparent suicides of the two prostitutes, surmising that the client was using Gruneman&#x27;s name. He also thinks the client killed Gruneman and might kill Bree next. Klute revisits Gruneman&#x27;s acquaintances. By typographic comparison, the obscene letters are traced to Cable, to whom Klute has been reporting during his investigation. Klute asks Cable for money to buy the &quot;black book&quot; of McKenna&#x27;s clients to learn the identity of the abusive client. He leaves enough bread crumbs to see whether Cable reveals his own complicity in the murders.

Cable follows Bree to a client&#x27;s office and reveals that he sent her the letters. Cable tells her that after Gruneman accidentally found him physically abusing McKenna, Cable was worried that Gruneman would use the incident to sabotage Cable&#x27;s career, so Cable tried to frame Gruneman by planting the letter in his office. After playing a snuff audiotape he recorded as he murdered Page, he attacks Bree. When he sees Klute rush in, Cable abruptly lurches backward, crashing through a window to his death.

Bree vacates her apartment with Klute&#x27;s help. A voiceover conversation with her psychiatrist reveals her hesitancy to surrender her life of autonomy to enter into a traditional relationship with Klute, saying that she would lose her mind if she turned to a domestic lifestyle. She admits that although she will miss Klute, she is unable to tell him and jokes that the doctor will likely see her again the next week. As they leave the apartment, Bree receives a telephone call from a client and she informs him she is leaving New York and does not expect to return. She and Klute leave the apartment together.

==Cast==

In addition, future Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award winningnominated actors Jean Stapleton (credited) and Sylvester Stallone (uncredited extra) appear in the film.

==Themes==
Writer Karen Gai Dean notes paranoia and surveillance as principal themes in &quot;Klute&quot;. She writes that the film&#x27;s recurrent use of audio tapes as both &quot;visual and aural themes ... presciently evoke the paranoia of the Watergate era.&quot;

The film was retconned to form the first installment of Pakula&#x27;s &quot;paranoia trilogy&quot;, followed by &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974) and &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), which similarly dealt with themes of paranoia, conspiracies, and surveillance. Scott Tobias of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that while the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the conspiratorial flavor of Pakula&#x27;s more political films, &quot;Klute&quot; approaches the genre with the same creepy ambience, with camera angles that suggest surveillance, and an excellent score, by Michael Small, that would seem more suited to horror, with its jangling of keys on the far end of a piano. There&#x27;s an aura of danger and instability that keeps the film on edge.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Andy Lewis, a writer who had primarily worked in television, developed the screenplay for &quot;Klute&quot; with the goal of wanting to transition into feature films. His initial inspiration for the screenplay originated from a serial story he had read as a child in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; about a man from the country who ventures into the city in an attempt to solve the murder of his brother who was killed there in an empty lot. Lewis focused on two themes he felt were resonant to Americans, firstly &quot;the rube who turns the tables on the city slickers&quot;, and secondly, paranoia: &quot;I&#x27;m sure this afflicts people all over the world, but I somehow think of it as typically American. The hidden pattern of things. The darkness. The people out there watching you, plotting against you, waiting to hurt you. Sounds you hear at night. Silences on the phone. All that stuff. I figured I would write this thing, however it went, to take the fullest possible advantage of this—what should we call it?—instinct. Deliberately.&quot;

The spec script was completed by Andy Lewis in collaboration with his older brother, Dave. The brothers corresponded by letters and phone—Andy from his Massachusetts residence, and Dave from his home in California—with Andy undertaking much of the scripting. Andy commented that the writing was highly collaborative, concluding: &quot;I&#x27;d have trouble attributing any part of the original script to one or the other of us solely.&quot;

===Casting===
The casting of Jane Fonda, who had recently completed &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969) was announced in April 1970. At the time, Fonda had attracted significant scrutiny for her activism against the Vietnam War, and much of the publicity surrounding the film made note of this. To prepare for the role, Fonda spent a week in New York City observing high-class call girls and madams. She also accompanied them on their outings to after-hours clubs to solicit men. Fonda was disturbed that none of the men showed any interest in her, which she believed was because they could see that she was really just an &quot;upper-class, privileged pretender&quot;.

Fonda had doubts about whether she could portray the role and asked Alan Pakula to release her from her contract and hire Faye Dunaway instead, but Pakula refused. One of Fonda&#x27;s primary concerns was that she, as an emerging feminist, should not play a prostitute, but when Fonda admitted this concern to a longstanding feminist, she was told &quot;If the script is good, and it&#x27;s an opportunity to be three-dimensional, of course you should do it!&quot; To overcome her doubts that she could play such a role, Fonda turned to her memories of several call girls whom she had known while living in France, all of whom worked for the famed Madame Claude. She remembered that all of them had been sexually abused as children, and Fonda used this as an &quot;entry&quot; to her own character and as a way to understand Bree&#x27;s motivations in becoming a prostitute.

Donald Sutherland was cast as private investigator, John Klute, signing onto the project in May 1970. Sutherland later admitted that he clashed with Pakula during the production, commenting that it &quot;was a film where the director had a specific idea, which I didn&#x27;t particularly understand, nor was I particularly interested in.&quot; Roy Scheider was cast as Bree&#x27;s pimp, Frank Ligourin, a role that brought him significant attention and notably furthered his career.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Klute&quot; began in December 1970 in New York City. In March 1971, it was reported that filming had completed.

The film was shot by cinematographer Gordon Willis, a frequent collaborator of Pakula known for his employment of darkness and shadows in his cinematography. Film scholar Terence McSweeney writes in &quot;The Other Hollywood Renaissance&quot; (2020) that the film&#x27;s cinematography is deliberately destabilizing and disorienting, utilizing close-up shots while lacking establishing shots, and that its editing style features abrupt transitions and a lack of traditional film cues. Actor Sutherland, reflecting on the film, commented that, &quot;there were a lot of things in &quot;Klute&quot; that didn&#x27;t make any sense in terms of movies.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Klute&quot; was released theatrically in the United States by Warner Bros., premiering on June 23, 1971, in Los Angeles and New York City before opening wide on June 25.

===Box office===
The film earned US$8 million () in theatrical rentals at the North American box office.

===Critical response===

&quot;Klute&quot; was widely praised by critics for its screenplay and Fonda&#x27;s performance, though some criticized Pakula&#x27;s unconventional direction. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Donald Sutherland is coolly commanding and Jane Fonda a force of nature in &quot;Klute&quot;, a cuttingly intelligent thriller that generates its most agonizing tension from its stars&#x27; repartee.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Charles Champlin praised Fonda and Sutherland&#x27;s performances, summarizing: &quot;&quot;Klute&quot; is visually stunning, full of surprises, bewildering and suspenseful, faultless in its timing... Like the best mysteries always, &quot;Klute&quot; offers more than its diversions and redeems its sordid materials by understanding them and finding them worth pity, not amusement.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded &quot;Klute&quot; 3.5 stars out of a possible 4, writing that while the thriller elements were poorly executed, the performances of Sutherland and especially Fonda carried the film. He suggested that the film should have been titled &quot;Bree&quot; after her character, who is the &quot;soul&quot; of the film and avoids the hooker with a heart of gold stereotype: 

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was similarly appreciative, writing: &quot;More interesting than the mystery is the character of Bree... the nicest part of her character (due to the script and Miss Fonda&#x27;s fine performance) is that this prostitute doesn&#x27;t have a heart of gold. She&#x27;s a hungup little broad who, when cornered by violence or tenderness, will scratch and bite. Director Alan Pakula&#x27;s... crisply edited movie runs too long only in drawing out its conclusion….Sharp eyes will solve the mystery midway thru the film. Miss Fonda&#x27;s performance is superior to her most recent work in &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;... Sutherland... presents a controlled posture as the industrious detective. His low profile nicely balances Miss Fonda&#x27;s incendiary role.&quot;

J. Luria, writing for the &quot;Professional Psychology: Research and Practice&quot; journal, praised the film for its psychological elements, particularly its nuanced depiction of prostitution, noting that &quot;a good mystery plot and excellent acting make this film entertaining. But the sociopsychological scrutiny of the prostitution subculture makes it outstanding. The film unfolds on several levels, the description of the call girl, the struggle for her growth, the relationship of Klute and Bree, and the mystery theme. Overall, it is an excellent blending of the clinical and the literal.&quot;

Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in one of the few negative reviews, wrote, &quot;Pakula, when he is not indulging in subjective camera, strives to give his film the look of structural geometry, but despite the sharp edges and dramatic spaces and cinema presence out of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; it all suggests a tepid, rather tasteless mush. The acting in &quot;Klute&quot; seems semi-improvisatory, and in this Jane Fonda, who is good at confessing, is generally successful. Everybody else merely talks a lot, except for Sutherland, who scarcely talks at all. A normally inventive actor, he is here given precisely the latitude to evoke a romantic figure with all the mysterious intensity of a youthful Calvin Coolidge.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in 1985, critic Dave Kehr declared the film &quot;as close to a classic as anything New Hollywood produced.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Home media===
Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released &quot;Klute&quot; on DVD first in February 2002. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray in July 2019 featuring a new 4K restoration from the original film elements.

<doc id="223904" wikidata="Q1856597" url="?curid=223904" title="Mary, Queen of Scots (1971 film)">
<text>Mary, Queen of Scots is a 1971 historical drama film based on the life of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland, written by John Hale and directed by Charles Jarrott. The cast was led by Vanessa Redgrave as the title character and Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I. Jackson had previously played the part of Elizabeth in the BBC TV drama &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;, screened in February and March 1971, the first episode of which was also written by Hale.

The film received mixed reviews with criticism of the screenplay, running length and historical inaccuracies; however it received praise for the leading female performances, its production values, and musical score. At the 44th Academy Awards, the film received five nominations including Best Actress (for Redgrave).

==Plot==
Following the death of her husband Francis II of France in 1560, Mary, Queen of Scots returns to her native land. Though fearless, unselfish, and very beautiful, the young queen faces many challenges. As in neighbouring England, the Protestant faith has been embraced by many of the nobility; in addition, the Catholic Mary has to deal with her Protestant and illegitimate half-brother James Stewart, Lord Moray&#x27;s ambition to rule. He suggests that Mary enjoy herself in Scotland, and pass the time with dancing and feasting.

Fearing that Mary has ambitions for England&#x27;s throne, Elizabeth I of England decides to weaken her claim by sending her favourite, the ambitious Robert Dudley, to woo and marry Mary. Elizabeth promises that Mary will become her heir if she agrees to the marriage. Sly Elizabeth also sends the younger, dashing but weak and spoiled Lord Darnley from a powerful Catholic family. Tempted by the handsome Darnley, Mary impulsively chooses him for marriage. Moray opposes the marriage, but Mary ignores him. She exiles Moray to strengthen her own authority. Elizabeth is satisfied that reckless, passionate Mary&#x27;s romantic misadventures will keep her busy in Scotland and give England less to worry about.

Soon after the wedding, Darnley throws a childish temper tantrum, complaining that he has no real power and is merely Mary&#x27;s king consort. Disillusioned, Mary soon banishes Darnley from her bed and frequently consults with the gentle, soft-spoken Italian musician and courtier David Riccio. Darnley previously had him as a lover and accuses him of fathering Mary&#x27;s expected child.

A group of Scottish lords persuade Darnley to help get rid of Riccio, whom they murder in Mary&#x27;s presence. To escape, she persuades Darnley that the plotters will turn against him, and they flee to the safety of a castle belonging to Lord Bothwell. He has been an ally of Mary since her arrival in Scotland. After he defeats the plotters, Mary forces a truce between Moray, Darnley and Bothwell. Mary gives birth to a son, James, who is expected to succeed both Mary and the unmarried, childless Elizabeth.

The peace is short-lived. Darnley still wants power, though by now he is hideously scarred and dying of syphilis (the pox). Mary pities him, but finds herself falling in love with the rough but loyal Bothwell. With Moray&#x27;s help, they arrange for Darnley to be killed in a gunpowder explosion at his manor; Darnley escapes before the blast but is strangled. Bothwell marries Mary, and their few brief nights together are blissful. But Moray rejoins the Scottish lords and leads a rebellion against Mary. He forces her to abdicate, and she and her husband are driven into exile, Mary to England and Bothwell to Denmark. Mary&#x27;s young son James is to be crowned king of Scotland (although Moray will effectively rule as regent) and raised as a Protestant.

In England, Mary begs Elizabeth for money and an army to regain her throne. Instead Elizabeth takes her prisoner, keeping her locked away in a remote castle. Elizabeth&#x27;s closest advisor, Sir William Cecil, is anxious to get rid of Mary, but Elizabeth fears to set a precedent by putting an anointed monarch to death. She also fears that Mary&#x27;s death might spark a rebellion by her Catholic subjects and cause problems with powerful France and Spain. As a result, Mary is doomed to an open-ended captivity. Over time, the once proud queen of Scots succumbs to an empty routine, plotting half-heartedly to escape but growing increasingly used to her seclusion. She occupies herself with a daily schedule of cards, embroidery and gossip, talking vaguely of escape yet sleeping later and later each morning.

With the help of fellow minister Walsingham, Cecil finds evidence of Mary&#x27;s involvement in the conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth known as the Babington Plot. Finally Elizabeth confronts Mary, who regains her royal pride and behaves defiantly at their secret meeting. Although Elizabeth offers her mercy if she begs for forgiveness, Mary will not beg for mercy in public. She endures the trial, conviction and execution. She knows her son James will ultimately succeed to the English throne.

==Historical liberties==
For dramatic effect, the film presents two meetings between the queens, although they never met in life.

The film also depicts a homosexual relationship between Darnley and Riccio not known to history, although they may have been friends initially. The confrontation at Bothwell&#x27;s Hermitage Castle seems loosely based on an actual incident at Carberry, and the film misses out the decisive Battle of Langside.

James VI and I was born in Edinburgh Castle, not Hermitage Castle as depicted in the film.

==Production notes==
The movie reunited Hal Wallis, John Hale and Charles Jarrott who had made &quot;Anne of a Thousand Days&quot;. Wallis was looking to do a follow-up and decided to make a film about Mary Queen of Scots, in part because a best-selling book about her by Antonia Fraser was in the news. &quot;I did not read it because I knew it was based on historical fact and was sure there was nothing in it we couldn&#x27;t obtain from a study of history books,&quot; claimed Wallis in his memoirs.

Like the play by Friedrich Schiller (&quot;Maria Stuart&quot;, 1800) and the opera by Gaetano Donizetti (&quot;Maria Stuarda&quot;, 1835), it takes considerable liberties with history in order to achieve increased dramatic effect, in particular two fictitious face-to-face encounters between the two queens (who never met in real life). &quot;Audiences would feel cheated if they never had a scene together.&quot; said Wallis.

Wallis says Jarrott wanted to emphasise the religious differences of the two lead characters but the producer &quot;felt this was too heavy&quot;.

Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson were the first choices for their roles. Jackson agreed to play the role if all her scenes could be shot in three and a half weeks &quot;before boredom set in&quot;. The script was rewritten accordingly.

Glenda Jackson said during filming, &quot;I prefer Vanessa&#x27;s part. Mary was a tart—three marriages, one to a man with syphilis, murders, prison, intrigue, violence—the whole lot.&quot; She said Elizabeth &quot;is no virgin the way I&#x27;m playing her.&quot;

===Shooting===
Filming started 17 May 1971. The film was shot in France (Château de Chenonceau), Hermitage Castle, Scotland; and in England at Alnwick Castle, Bamburgh Castle, Parham Park in West Sussex, and Chiltern Open Air Museum in Buckinghamshire. The song in the opening sequence, &quot;Vivre et Mourir&quot;, is sung by Redgrave.

The lyrics are taken from a sonnet written by Mary, Queen of Scots.

Redgrave and Timothy Dalton began a romantic relationship during the making of the film.

==Release==
The film&#x27;s UK premiere was the annual Royal Film Performance on 27 March 1972 at the Odeon Leicester Square, attended by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. It grossed £19,815 ($47,566) in its first 9 days of release after the premiere.

==Reception==
Vincent Canby had little good to write about the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describing it as &quot;a loveless, passionless costume drama&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Unfortunately there is no excitement whatsoever in what Charles Jarrott, the director, and John Hale, the author of the original screenplay, have put together ... &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; intends, I assume, to illuminate history ... yet all it&#x27;s really doing is touching bases, like a dull, dutiful student ... Because both Miss Redgrave and Miss Jackson possess identifiable intelligence, [the film] is not as difficult to sit through as some bad movies I can think of. It&#x27;s just solemn, well-groomed and dumb.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars and lauded the interpretation of Redgrave and Jackson, stating: &quot;Vanessa Redgrave is a tall, straight-backed, finely spirited Mary, and Glenda Jackson makes a perfectly shrewish, wise Elizabeth.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;commercial prospects are good.&quot;

<text>The Duchy of Bohemia was established in 870 and raised to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198. Several Bohemian monarchs ruled as non-hereditary kings and first gained the title in 1085. From 1004 to 1806, Bohemia was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and its ruler was an elector. From 1526 to 1804, the Kingdom of Bohemia, together with the other lands of the Bohemian Crown, was ruled under a personal union as part of the Habsburg monarchy. From 1804 to 1918, Bohemia was part of the Austrian Empire, which itself was part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary from 1867 to 1918. Following the dissolution of the monarchy, the Bohemian lands, now also referred to as Czech lands, became part of Czechoslovakia, and they have formed today&#x27;s Czech Republic since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

He recorded two albums with Jimmy Witherspoon called &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot;. In the 1970s, Ford joined the jazz fusion band, L.A. Express, led by saxophonist Tom Scott. In 1974, the band supported George Harrison on his American tour and played on the Joni Mitchell albums &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; and &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot;.

After leaving the L.A. Express in 1976, Robben Ford recorded his first solo album, &quot;The Inside Story&quot; with a band that later became the Yellowjackets.

In 1977 Ford was one of over half a dozen session players asked to play a guitar solo for the Steely Dan song &quot;Peg.&quot; The band eventually used a version by Jay Graydon. In 2006, a tribute album to Steely Dan – &quot;The Royal Dan&quot; – was released, with Ford covering &quot;Peg&quot; in his own style.

In 1982, Ford was one of several guitarists who appeared on the KISS album &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;, playing lead guitar on the songs &quot;Rock And Roll Hell&quot; and &quot;I Still Love You&quot;.

Ford worked briefly with Miles Davis in 1986; and can be heard on Davis&#x27; Montreux box set. Ford released his second solo album &quot;Talk to Your Daughter&quot; in 1988. He joined Philippe Saisse, Marcus Miller and J.T. Lewis in the cast of The Sunday Night Band for the second and final season of the late-night NBC television program &quot;Sunday Night&quot; in 1989. In the 1990s, he released the albums &quot;Robben Ford and the Blue Line, Mystic Mile, Handful of Blues, Tiger Walk and Supernatural&quot;.

Robben Ford has received five Grammy Award nominations and was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of the 20th Century&quot; by &quot;Musician&quot; magazine. He credited pianist and arranger Roger Kellaway and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, whom he met while playing for Joni Mitchell, as major influences on his musical development.

Robben Ford was married to Anne Kerry Ford. As of 2022 he lives in Paris, France.

In October 2022, Ford toured in Italy opening for Eric Clapton.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===
Ford considers his first good electric a Guild Starfire III with a single Florentine (sharp) cutaway. He used a Gibson L-5 when he played with Charlie Musselwhite and the Ford Band, although he never thought it was a great guitar. While playing with Jimmy Witherspoon, Ford traded the L-5 plus $200 for a 1964 Gibson Super 400CES (which he sold in 1986). When Ford began playing with the L.A. Express and Joni Mitchell, he used a 1958 Gibson dot-neck ES-335. At some point he also acquired a 1963 Gibson Es-335.

After Ford&#x27;s &quot;Talk to Your Daughter&quot; album was released in 1988, Robben used a Robben Ford Signature model guitar created in a collaboration with Dan Smith of Fender and produced in Japan between 1987 and 1993. That guitar was based on the Fender Master Series Esprit Ultra that was produced from 1983 to 1986 in Japan. In 1987, new management at Fender authorized the first production of the Robben Ford Signature guitar. In 1994, production of the guitar moved from Japan to the Fender Custom Shop. Three models were produced: Ultra FM (with a carved maple top), Ultra SP (with a carved spruce top), and the Elite FM (with a carved flame maple top). The guitar line continued to be produced until 2002 when it was discontinued by Fender.

Sometimes he plays a vintage 1960 Fender Telecaster, Gibson Les Pauls, a 1963 Gibson SG, a Gibson Es-335 12-string that he has set up as a 6-string, a 1966 Epiphone Riviera (with the original Bigsby tremolo removed and replaced with a stop tailpiece).
In a May 1–16, 2017 tour which ended in Niagara Falls NY, Ford debuted a newly acquired 1953 Gibson Les Paul.

In the summer of 2021 he teased a PRS Robben Ford Limited Edition McCarty signature guitar which was finally released in October 2022.

===Amplifiers===
Robben Ford uses Dumble Amplifiers and Celestion G12-65 speakers. In 1983, Alexander &quot;Howard&quot; Dumble made Robben&#x27;s first Dumble Overdrive Special (serial #102) for Robben. Dumble himself is the owner of serial #001.

When traveling abroad he prefers taking his Dumble, but will sometimes use Fender Super Reverb or Fender Twin amplifiers. When playing his Fenders, Ford uses a Hermida Zendrive overdrive pedal, which was designed to replicate the sound of Ford&#x27;s Dumble amplifier.

<doc id="223911" wikidata="Q20826083" url="?curid=223911" title="Lord Darnley">
<text>Lord Darnley is a noble title associated with a Scottish Lordship of Parliament, first created in 1356 for the family of Stewart of Darnley and tracing a descent to the Dukedom of Richmond in England. The title&#x27;s name refers to Darnley in Scotland. Outside the Peerage of Scotland, another Earldom of Darnley was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1729.

==Early history==
The first baron was Sir John Stewart of Darnley. His descendant, John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox, was created Earl of Lennox in 1488. Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox (1516–1571), was the father of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (1545–1567) (later created Duke of Albany), better known as &quot;Lord Darnley&quot;, a courtesy title, his father holding that title, who became the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, and thus father of King James VI and I (1566–1625).
Together with Lord Ruthven and others, Darnley openly murdered David Rizzio in Holyrood Palace in March 1566. Mary thereafter distanced herself from Darnley.

On 10 February 1567, Darnley died when his residence was destroyed by a bomb whilst his wife, Mary, Queen of Scots, attended a party for the wedding of her servant Bastian Pagez. Darnley and his groom were found dead at the scene with marks on their necks (possibly they were strangled) and next to them lay a knife with which they had been stabbed. The suspected murderer, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, married Mary one month after he was acquitted and released from jail.

==Later history==
With the elevation of the Earldom of Lennox to a dukedom in 1581 the barony of Darnley retained its link with Lennox and in 1612 the Dukedom of Richmond was added to the title and remained so after its extinction and revival in 1675. The subsidiary Earldom of Darnley was revived at the same time.

<text>James Hepburn (died 1524) was a Scottish prelate and administrator. He was the son of Alexander Hepburn of Whitsome. His name occurs as the rector of Dalry and king&#x27;s clerk on 1 August 1511. Hepburn was Treasurer of Scotland between from at least June 1515, until October the following year. He also held the position of rector of Parton in the diocese of Galloway.

He was elected Bishop of Moray sometime before 12 February 1516, on the nomination of the Governor of Scotland, John Stewart, Duke of Albany, following the translation of Bishop Andrew Forman to the Archbishopric of St Andrews.

Hepburn had been granted the temporalities of the see by 28 August. With his provision by Pope Leo X on 14 May 1516, he received a Bull exempting him from the metropolitan and legatine jurisdiction of the Archbishop of St Andrews. Although Archbishop Forman (d. 1521) had consented to this, his successor James Beaton resented it, and wrote to a senior Cardinal as a part of a wider attempt to have this reversed.

Among other activities as during his short episcopate, Hepburn instituted the church of Duffus as a new rectory. He died shortly before 11 November 1524.

<text>Dame Janet Suzman (born 9 February 1939) is a South African-born British actress who had a successful early career in the Royal Shakespeare Company, later replaying many Shakespearean roles on television. In her first film, &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), her performance as Empress Alexandra Feodorovna earned her several honours, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Suzman later starred in a wide range of classical and modern drama as well as directing many productions in the UK and South Africa. Suzman appeared in &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989), a film that examined apartheid.

==Early life==
Janet Suzman was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a Jewish family, the daughter of Betty (née Sonnenberg) and Saul Suzman, a wealthy tobacco importer.

Her grandfather, Max Sonnenberg, was a member of the South African parliament, and her aunt was the civil rights and anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman. Suzman was educated at the independent school Kingsmead College, Johannesburg, and at the University of the Witwatersrand.

==Stage career==
After training for the stage at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, Suzman made her debut as Liz in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; at the Tower Theatre, Ipswich, in 1962. She became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1963 and started her career there as Joan of Arc in &quot;The Wars of The Roses&quot; (1962–64). The RSC gave her the opportunity to play many of the Shakespearean heroines, including Rosaline in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Kate in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Celia and Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Lavinia in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and her Cleopatra, magisterial, ardent and seductive, in 1973, which is said to have been a definitive performance. (An ATV/ITC television production, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, was broadcast in 1974 in the UK and was shown internationally.) Although her stage appearances tended to run naturally towards Shakespeare and the classics, including Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, Marlowe, Racine, Gorky and Brecht, she also appeared in plays by Genet, Pinter, Ronald Harwood, Nicholson, Albee and others.

==Films and television==
She appeared in many British television drama productions in the 1960s and early 1970s, including &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1968), &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (1970), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1970), &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1972), &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1973), as Hilda Lessways in &quot;Clayhanger&quot; (1975), as Lady Mountbatten in &quot;Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy&quot; (1985) and Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986). Her first film role was in &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1972), and she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA and the Golden Globe for her portrayal of the Empress Alexandra. This was followed by &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; (1972) opposite Alan Bates. In addition to the 1974 television version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, she also appeared as &quot;Frosine&quot; in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Theatre Night&quot; 1988 production of &quot;The Miser&quot; opposite Nigel Hawthorne as &quot;Harpagon&quot; and Jim Broadbent as Maitre Jacques. Another role was that of Frieda Lawrence in &quot;Priest of Love&quot; (1981).

Suzman has made few films since, including Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;The Black Windmill&quot; (1974), &quot;Nijinsky&quot; (1980), Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; (1982), Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;E la Nave Va&quot; (&quot;And the Ship Sails On&quot; 1983), &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989) with Marlon Brando and &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; (1990; a rare comedic role). In 2020 Suzman appeared in the Netflix production of &quot;The Crown&quot; as the literary agent of Michael Shea, the queen&#x27;s press secretary. The episode dealt with the rift between Buckingham Palace and Margaret Thatcher over the prime minister&#x27;s refusal to back Commonwealth sanctions against South Africa. The episode also implied that Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s stance might have been linked to her son Mark&#x27;s business interests in South Africa.

==Later activities==
In her native South Africa she directed &quot;Othello&quot;, which was televised, and Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Good Woman of Setzuan&quot; (renamed &quot;The Good Woman of Sharpeville&quot;) both at the Market Theatre, Johannesburg. She also toured her modern adaptation of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; – a South African response entitled &quot;The Free State&quot;. She wrote, starred in and directed this piece with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Other productions with Suzman as director included &quot;A Dream of People&quot; at the RSC, &quot;The Cruel Grasp&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival, Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;No Flies on Mr Hunter&quot; (Chelsea Centre, 1992), &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (Theatr Clwyd, 1993), and Pam Gems&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Palace&quot; (Tour and Tricycle Theatre, 1998).

In 2002, she returned to the RSC to perform in a new version of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; with Sir Donald Sinden, Ian Richardson and Sir Derek Jacobi. In 2005, she appeared in the West End in a revival of Brian Clark&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; starring Kim Cattrall. In 2006 she directed &quot;Hamlet&quot; and in 2007 she played Volumnia in &quot;Coriolanus&quot; in Stratford-upon-Avon, for which she received excellent notices. In 2010, she appeared in &quot;Dream of the Dog&quot;, a new South African play, at the Finborough Theatre, London, which subsequently transferred to the West End. Suzman wrote &quot;Acting With Shakespeare: Three Comedies&quot;, a book based on a series of acting master classes. 

In 2014, Suzman was criticized for comments regarding arts participation in the theater. In response to a call by Meera Syal to engage in more diverse audiences, Suzman referred to theater as &quot;a white invention, a European invention. There is, in fact no archaeological evidence to indicate otherwise.&quot;

==Personal life and honours==
In 1969, she married director Trevor Nunn and together they had a son. They divorced in 1986.

Suzman was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to drama. 

Suzman holds honorary DLitt degrees from the universities of Warwick, Leicester, London (QMW), Southampton, Middlesex, Kingston, Cape Town, Edge Hill and Buckingham. 

She is an Honorary Fellow of the Shakespeare Institute, and was awarded the Pragnell Award for lifetime services to Shakespeare in 2012. She is a patron of the London International Festival of Theatre.

<doc id="223922" wikidata="Q5326207" url="?curid=223922" title="Earl of Beaconsfield">
<text>Earl of Beaconsfield, of Hughenden in the County of Buckingham, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1876 for Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, a favourite of Queen Victoria. Victoria favoured Disraeli&#x27;s Tory policies over those of his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone. Disraeli had also promoted the Royal Titles Act 1876 that had given Victoria the title of Empress of India. The subsidiary title of the earldom was Viscount Hughenden, of Hughenden in the County of Buckingham, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

In 1868, at the end of his first term as prime minister, Disraeli&#x27;s wife Mary had been created Viscountess Beaconsfield, of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham, in her own right, allowing her husband to remain a member of the House of Commons. Lady Beaconsfield died in 1872. When Disraeli became an earl in 1876 he automatically lost his seat in the Commons but remained prime minister, leading his government from the House of Lords.

Beaconsfield is the name of a town in the county of Buckinghamshire. For most of his parliamentary career, Disraeli served as a member for Buckinghamshire. He owned an estate, Hughenden Manor, in the nearby town of High Wycombe, but never lived in Beaconsfield. His choice of title might have been partly influenced by the fact that in 1794 the conservative political philosopher and parliamentarian Edmund Burke, whom Disraeli admired, had turned down King George III&#x27;s offer to raise him to the peerage as Lord Beaconsfield.

In 1878, Disraeli refused Queen Victoria&#x27;s offer to make him a duke, accepting instead membership in the Order of the Garter. The Disraelis died without direct heirs and their titles became extinct; Hughenden Manor passed to Lord Beaconsfield&#x27;s nephew Coningsby Disraeli.

<doc id="223924" wikidata="Q27511" url="?curid=223924" title="Daihatsu">
<text>is a Japanese automobile manufacturer headquartered in Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture, Japan.

Historically one of the oldest surviving Japanese internal combustion engine manufacturers, the company was known for building three-wheeled vehicles and off-road vehicles, while currently the company offers a range of kei car models, along with kei trucks, kei vans and other larger small cars in Japan. The company produces entry-level compact cars in Japan and Southeast Asia, which are supplied to global emerging markets under the Toyota brand.

, Daihatsu&#x27;s presence has been limited to Japan and Indonesia under the Daihatsu brand, and Malaysia under the Perodua brand, where the company has significant research and development resources, manufacturing facilities and sales operations.

Since August 2016, the company has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Toyota Motor Corporation. , Daihatsu accounts for four percent of Toyota Group&#x27;s total vehicle sales.

==Name==
The name &quot;Daihatsu&quot; is a combination of the first symbol (&quot;kanji&quot;) of Ōsaka (大) and the first of the word . In the new combination the reading of the &quot;大&quot; is changed from &quot;ō&quot; to &quot;dai&quot;, giving &quot;dai hatsu&quot;.

==History==

Daihatsu was officially formed on March 1, 1951, as a successor to Hatsudoki Seizo Co. Ltd, founded in 1907, as part of Hatsudoki&#x27;s major restructuring. Hatsudoki&#x27;s formation was largely influenced by the Engineering Department&#x27;s faculty of Osaka University, to develop a gasoline-powered engine for small, stationary power plants. From the beginning of the company until 1930, when a prototype three-wheeler truck was considered and proposed, Hatsudoki&#x27;s focus was largely steam engines for Japanese National Railways and included rail carriages for passenger transportation. The company then focused on railroad diesel engines, working with Niigata Engineering and Shinko Engineering Co., Ltd. Before the company began to manufacture automobiles, their primary Japanese competitor was Yanmar for diesel engines that were not installed in a commercial truck to provide motivation.

The company&#x27;s decision to focus on automobile production and related technologies was influenced by the early days of automobile manufacturing in Japan during the late 1920s and 1930s, when both Ford and General Motors had opened factories in Japan and enjoyed a considerable market share. Ford opened a factory at Yokohama in March 1925 and in 1927 GM opened Osaka Assembly until both factories were appropriated by the Imperial Japanese Government before World War II.

During the 1960s, Daihatsu began exporting its range to Europe, where it did not have major sales success until well into the 1980s. In Japan, the majority of Daihatsu models occupies the kei car segment.

Daihatsu was an independent automaker until Toyota Motor Corporation became a major shareholder in 1967 as the Japanese government intended to open up the domestic market. According to Toyota, it was first approached by Sanwa Bank, banker of Daihatsu. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company from 16.8% to 33.4% by acquiring shares from other shareholders: banks and insurance companies. At the time, the company was producing mini-vehicles and some small cars under contract for Toyota. Toyota, by owning more than a one-third stake, would be able to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting. In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2% by purchasing shares from its major shareholders including financial institutions.

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 Daihatsu&#x27;s sales in Europe plummeted, from 58,000 in 2007 to 12,000 in 2011. Daihatsu pulled out of the European market by 2013, citing the persistently strong yen, which makes it difficult for the company to make a profit from its export business. 

In August 2011, Daihatsu invested 20 billion yen ($238.9 million) in Indonesia to build a factory that produces low-cost cars under the Low Cost Green Car scheme. The construction had been initialized on 70,000 square meters on May 27, 2011 and started operations at the end of 2012, producing up to 100,000 cars per year.

In August 2016, Daihatsu became a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation. In January 2017, Daihatsu and Toyota jointly established an internal company to develop compact vehicles for emerging markets called the &#x27;Emerging-market Compact Car Company&#x27;. Under the internal company, Daihatsu is responsible of product planning and quality planning of the vehicles, while both Toyota and Daihatsu are jointly responsible of product and business planning. To support the company, Toyota Motor Asia Pacific Engineering and Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TMAP-EM) in Thailand was renamed to Toyota Daihatsu Engineering and Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TDEM).

In October 2016, Daihatsu and Toyota announced a new vehicle architecture called the Daihatsu New Global Architecture (DNGA) was being developed. The second-generation Mira e:S was revealed as the first DNGA model in 2017, although the company later revised the definition of DNGA and launched the fourth-generation Tanto claiming it as the first DNGA model instead.

From 2020 to 2022, Daihatsu trained employees from less-profitable sister company Toyota Motor East Japan to improve the latter&#x27;s systems on development and production of small cars.

In April 2023, Daihatsu was found to have rigged safety tests for 88,000 cars, most of which were sold as Toyota Yaris to Thailand, Mexico and Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The door trim of side-collision test cars was notched in order to minimize the risk of injury, but the modification was not applied to production vehicles.

In December 2023, the company halted shipments of 64 models, including kei, Mazda, Subaru, and two dozens branded as Toyota, after safety investigations uncovered misconduct far greater in scope than previously expected. In some models, the airbag control unit used in testing was different from the part installed on vehicles sold to the public. Results of speed tests and headrest impact tests had also been falsified. The cases went back as far as 1989 and became particularly prevalent after 2014. Affected markets included Japan as well as Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam. The company announced that it would shut down all four of its manufacturing plants in Japan until the end of January 2024.

==Export markets==
Daihatsu&#x27;s first export was in 1953, and by 1980 half a million Daihatsu vehicles had been exported. In 1979 a European main office was established in Brussels, tasked with controlling and expanding Western European exports. Since the late 1990s, its exports have been steadily contracting. This has been partially offset by the sale of Daihatsu vehicles through the Toyota channel, and the sale of technology to Malaysia&#x27;s Perodua. Daihatsu has also supplied cars under different badges to various automakers in the past. The company currently provides engines and transmissions to Malaysia&#x27;s Perodua, which manufactures and markets rebadged Daihatsu cars locally, and sold a small number of Perodua cars in the United Kingdom and Ireland until 2012.

===Asia and Oceania===

Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Daihatsu closed their plants in Thailand and withdrew from the market entirely. Until withdrawing in March 1998 they had mostly been selling the Mira range in Thailand; the Mira was also built there with certain local modifications.

After the launch of Perodua, Daihatsu&#x27;s Malaysian operations were scaled down to concentrate exclusively on the commercial vehicles market, selling its Delta and Gran Max commercial truck chassis; Daihatsu had formerly sold Charades and Miras in the country since it first began operations in Malaysia as a joint venture in 1980. In Indonesia, Daihatsu remains a major player.

It was reported on March 31, 2005, that Toyota would withdraw Daihatsu from the Australian market after sales fell heavily in the years leading up, in spite of the overall new-car market in Australia growing 7%. Daihatsu ended its Australian operations in March 2006 after almost 40 years there. At the time the marque sold the Charade, Copen, Delta, Sirion and Terios models.

Toyota New Zealand announced on April 8, 2013 that sales of new Daihatsu vehicles in the country would cease by the end of the year, citing a lack of products that would comply with future NZ regulatory standards. No additional new vehicles were being imported as of the announcement date.

===Americas===
Daihatsu&#x27;s operations in Chile, where Daihatsu is well known for its 1970s models such as the Charade or Cuore, were also threatened after low sales in 2004 and 2005. Toyota has stated that it intended to persist in the Chilean market, where only the Terios model was available until it was rebranded as the Toyota Rush in August 2016, as Daihatsu left that market.

In Trinidad and Tobago, Daihatsu has had a market presence since 1958 when its Mark I Midget was a popular choice among market tradesmen. From 1978 until 2001, a local dealer marketed the Charmant, Rocky, Fourtrak, and then later, the Terios and Grand Move which were popular. The Delta chassis remained popular from its introduction in 1985 until today. Toyota Trinidad and Tobago Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Japan) now markets Daihatsu Terios, YRV and Sirion under stiff competition.

In the United States, Daihatsus were marketed from 1988 until 1992 but were hampered by the 1990s recession, and that their products had very little impact as the company&#x27;s compact and fuel economic cars did not align with the perceived needs of American customers. Only the Charade and the Rocky were sold. Beginning in 1987, Daihatsu also sold the Hijet in the United States as an off-road only utility vehicle. 

Daihatsu and Bombardier Inc. had been planning to open an assembly plant for the Charade in Canada in 1989, with the ultimate goal of building a small car of Bombardier&#x27;s design to market in North America. These plans didn&#x27;t eventuate. After Daihatsu&#x27;s withdrawal from the US market, Toyota, which had recently purchased a controlling interest in Daihatsu, continued to provide after-sales support for existing Daihatsu customers through at least 2002.

===Europe===
European imports began in 1979. The company had little or no presence in countries with protectionist barriers, such as France and Spain—where local manufacturers also targeted the same market segment as Daihatsu. Daihatsu sold mainly in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. In Italy, Daihatsu partnered with local small car experts Innocenti in 1982 as a backdoor to several continental markets. The Italian manufacturer used Daihatsu drivetrains in their cars from 1983 until 1993.

Beginning in 1992, Piaggio manufactured the Hijet microvan and truck locally, as the Piaggio Porter, Innocenti Porter, or Daihatsu Hijet. It remains available as of 2020 and is also built in India. In the mid-1980s, Daihatsu also briefly imported Charade assembled by Alfa Romeo&#x27;s South African subsidiary to Italy, in another effort to circumvent import restrictions.

Daihatsu announced on January 13, 2011, that sales of Daihatsu motor cars would cease across Europe on January 31, 2013. This was due to the increasing strength of the Japanese yen, which had increased prices beyond competitive levels. Daihatsu had no stock of new Daihatsu cars in the UK at the time and did not intend to import any more cars in the interim period.

===Africa===
From 1983 until 1985, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s South African branch assembled the Charade for local sales and for export to Italy. In April 2015, the company pulled out of South Africa.

==Electrics and hybrids==
Daihatsu has had a long-running development program for electric vehicles, beginning with the production of &quot;pavilion cars&quot; for the 1970 Osaka World Expo and continuing with the production of golf carts and vehicles for institutional use, such as the DBC-1. An electric version of the company&#x27;s Fellow Max kei car also followed, the beginning of a series of prototypes. The 1973 oil crisis provided further impetus and at the 20th Tokyo Motor Show (1973) Daihatsu displayed a 550 W electric trike (TR-503E), the BCX-III electric car prototype and daihatsu&#x27;s own EV1.

Daihatsu showed more prototypes through the 1970s, for instance at the 1979 Sydney Motor Show, and then joined the Japanese Electric Vehicle Association&#x27;s PREET program (Public Rent and Electronic Towncar) with an electric version of the Max Cuore kei car. The program allowed registered users access to the cars with a magnetized card and charged according to mileage used.

In November 1974, Daihatsu released the Hallo (ES38V), a tilting trike powered by an electric motor and two 12V batteries.

In December 2011, Daihatsu released the Pico EV Concept, a quadricycle powered by an electric motor.

The company released a mild hybrid technology called the Daihatsu Mild Hybrid System in 2007, and is used in the Hijet/Atrai Hybrid-IV.

In November 2021, Daihatsu released their first mass-produced full hybrid system. Marketed as the &quot;e-Smart Hybrid&quot;, it is a series hybrid system as opposed to Toyota&#x27;s more advanced parallel hybrid technology. The technology was first used by the hybrid version of the A200 series Rocky. It is also used by the Toyota-branded model, the Raize under the common &quot;Hybrid Synergy Drive&quot; branding.

==Motorcycles==
In 1973, Daihatsu presented an electric tilting trike at the Tokyo Motor Show. This entered production in 1975 as the Hallo. Daihatsu also released a petrol powered version using a 50 cc two-stroke engine.

==Logo==
Daihatsu is well known with its signature stylized D logo. It debuted in September 1963 on the Compagno as the first automobile with the Daihatsu D logo. From its establishment in 1951 until 1969, Daihatsu also used a Ford-like logo, with &quot;Daihatsu&quot; vintage-style cursive wordmark (outside Japan) and Daihatsu wordmark in katakana, written inside an ellipse. Daihatsu had a secondary logo, based on a stylized drawing of Osaka Castle, as installed on its three-wheeler trucks during the 1950s to 1960s. The script logo remained in use as Daihatsu&#x27;s corporate logo and appeared on Daihatsu product catalogues and brochures until November 1969. Hence in the 1950s and 1960s Daihatsu was commonly referred to as Japan&#x27;s Ford, and as the Japanese equivalent to Ford. In December 1969, this logo was discontinued and Daihatsu officially used the D logo as its corporate logo. Except in Indonesia, the first Daihatsu logo was used in brochures until about 1977 or 1978. 

The famous D logo is a stylized, modernized version of the D in the earlier logo and resembles the &quot;da&quot; in katakana, as well as rocket shape and right arrow, representing Daihatsu&#x27;s spirit to keep moving forward and growing for excellence. The stylized D is also an initialism for Daihatsu. Beginning in January 1970, the Daihatsu wordmark was written in Eurostile font and placed below the D logo.

The D logo as the corporate logo, the white D placed inside the red rectangle, has been used from late 1969 onwards. The first version of the D logo, surrounded with circle, was used on Daihatsu automobiles from 1963 until 1979. From 1979 to 1989, the D logo was surrounded by a dark grey rectangle. In November 1989, following the launch of Toyota&#x27;s famous current logo, the D logo was surrounded by an oval, and made in chrome. The chrome D logo is used today, with several revisions, the most recent is a bolder and bigger chrome D logo introduced in 2004.

==Mascot==
The mascot for Daihatsu Motors is , an anthropomorphic deer character. Created by illustrator (who also designed the mascot for the Suica smart card system), he wears a white shirt as well as black pants, and is drawn in a lineless artstyle. According to a Daihatsu representative, he has a &quot;cool and slightly cynical&quot; personality. 

He has appeared in plenty of animated commercials for the company, as well as various merchandise and promo items primarily in Japan. Originally used to advertise the Daihatsu Move Conte (including his own special edition of the vehicle), he&#x27;s been used on and off in marketing materials since 2008. 

He has also appeared in commercials aired during New Year&#x27;s Day discussing the company&#x27;s sales. In 2018, they had the most commercials running for a single company within the first three days of the year on Japanese TV. Due to the 2023 emissions scandal, this was temporarily halted which led to disappointment from television viewers in the country. 

Kakukaku also has a cult following in the furry community, affectionately called the Kakukult, who has drawn fanart of the character. 

There is also a lesser known mascot named Tufton, a blue bird character designed to advertise the Daihatsu Taft line.

==Plants and production==
===Japan===
Daihatsu&#x27;s first, and oldest factory, called Ikeda Plant 1 was built in May 1939 in Ikeda, Osaka. The second factory was built May 1961 and is called Ikeda Plant 2. It houses the Osaka HQ office that was established March 1965. The company maintains an office in Tokyo, that was originally opened as Hatsudoki Seizo Co. Ltd. in June 1933 the Daihatsu Building.

Daihatsu currently has two factories in Ryūō, Shiga. The first factory was opened in April 1974, and the second one in January 1989. Daihatsu opened a factory in April 1973 in Ōyamazaki, Kyoto. Daihatsu opened two factories in Nakatsu, Ōita starting in November 2004 with Nakatsu Plant 1, followed by Nakatsu Plant 2 in November 2007. The Kurume Plant was opened in August 2008 in Kurume. It houses the Daihatsu Group Kyushu Development Center which opened in 2014.

<text>Dorothy Elizabeth Gish (March 11, 1898June 4, 1968) was an American stage and screen actress. Dorothy and her older sister Lillian Gish were major movie stars of the silent era. Dorothy also had great success on the stage, and was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Dorothy Gish was noted as a fine comedian, and many of her films were comedies.

==Early life==
Dorothy Gish was born in Dayton, Ohio. She had an older sister, Lillian. The Gish sisters&#x27; mother, Mary, supported the family after her husband James Leigh Gish, a traveling salesman, abandoned the family in New York. Mary Gish, who was &quot;a former actress and department store clerk&quot;, moved with her daughters to East St. Louis, Illinois, where she opened a candy and catering business. In 1902, at the age of four, Dorothy made her stage debut portraying the character &quot;Little Willie&quot; in &quot;East Lynne&quot;, an adaptation of the 1861 English novel by Ellen Wood.

In 1910, Mary heard from her husband&#x27;s brother, Grant Gish, who lived in Shawnee, Oklahoma and informed her that James was ill. He was in a hospital in nearby Norman, Oklahoma, so Mary sent 17-year-old Lillian to visit him. At first, Lillian wrote back to her 12-year-old sister Dorothy that she planned to stay in Oklahoma and continue her education, but after seeing her father she admitted she missed her mother and sister. So, after a few months away from them, in the spring of 1912, she traveled back. Soon afterward, their childhood friend, actress Mary Pickford, introduced the sisters to director D. W. Griffith, and they began performing as extras at the Biograph Studios in New York at salaries of 50 dollars a week. During his initial work with the sisters, Griffith found it difficult to distinguish one from the other, so he had Lillian wear a blue ribbon in her hair and Dorothy a red one. The girls, especially Lillian, impressed the director, so he included them in the entourage of cast and crew he took to California to produce films there.

==Career==

Dorothy and her sister debuted in Griffith&#x27;s 1912 production &quot;An Unseen Enemy&quot;. She would ultimately perform in over 100 short films and features, many times with Lillian. Throughout her own career, however, Dorothy had to contend with ongoing comparisons to her elder or &quot;big&quot; sister by film critics, fellow actors, studio executives, and by other insiders in the motion picture industry. Such comparisons began even from the outset of the sisters&#x27; work for Biograph. Linda Arvidson, Griffith&#x27;s first wife, recalls their initial work for the studio in her autobiography &quot;When The Movies Were Young&quot;:
===Near-fatal accident, 1914===
Dorothy Gish&#x27;s budding film career almost ended on a street in Los Angeles the day after Thanksgiving in 1914. On Friday, November 26, the 16-year-old actress was struck and nearly killed by a &quot;racing automobile&quot;. Newspapers and film-industry publications at the time reported the event and described the severe injuries Gish sustained. The near-fatal accident occurred as Dorothy was walking with Lillian at the intersection of Vermont and Prospect avenues. According to news reports, after the car struck her, it dragged her along the street for 40 to 50 feet. Other movie personnel who were standing together on a nearby sidewalk, including D. W. Griffith, witnessed Dorothy being hit. The following day, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; informed its readers about the accident:
Subsequent news reports also describe the reaction of other pedestrians at the scene. &quot;The Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot; and trade papers reported that Dorothy&#x27;s &quot;horrified friends&quot; rushed to her aid, with Griffith being among those who lifted the unconscious teenager into an ambulance and reportedly rode with her in the emergency vehicle. In addition to Gish&#x27;s initial examination by the doctor identified by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the Chicago newspaper and &quot;Motion Picture News&quot; stated that she was rushed to the hospital, where surgeons mended her &quot;very badly torn&quot; left side with &quot;many stitches&quot; and treated the area where one of her toes had been &quot;cut off&quot;, presumably a toe from her badly damaged right foot. At the time of the accident, Gish was completing a two-reel romantic comedy with actor W. E. Lawrence. The film, &quot;How Hazel Got Even&quot;, had already been delayed once at Reliance-Majestic Studios due to director Donald Crisp&#x27;s bout with pneumonia. Completion of the short was postponed yet again, for over a month, while Gish recuperated. Originally scheduled for release on December 27, 1914, &quot;How Hazel Got Even&quot; was not distributed to theaters until mid-February 1915.

===1915–1928===
After recovering from the 1914 accident, Gish resumed her screen career the following year, performing in a series of two- and three-reel shorts as well as in longer, more complex films such as the five-reel productions &quot;Old Heidelberg&quot;, directed by John Emerson, and &quot;Jordan Is a Hard Road&quot;, once again under D. W. Griffith&#x27;s direction. Increasingly, Dorothy&#x27;s appeal to both producers and audiences continued to grow in 1915, leading W. E. Keefe in the June issue of &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot; to recognize her as &quot;one of the most popular film stars on the Motion Picture screen&quot;. In an article about Gish in the cited issue, Keefe also recognizes that Dorothy, career-wise, was finally emerging from her sister&#x27;s shadow:
In 1916 and 1917, Dorothy continued to expand her acting credentials by starring in a variety of five-reelers for Fine Arts Film Company or &quot;Griffith&#x27;s studio&quot;, which was a subsidiary of Triangle Film Corporation. Her work in those years required filming on locations in New York and on the West Coast.
In the 1918 release &quot;Hearts of the World&quot;, a film about World War I and the devastation of France, Dorothy found her first cinematic foothold in comedy, striking a personal hit in a role that captured the essence of her sense of humor. As the &quot;little disturber&quot;, a street singer, her performance was the highlight of the film, and her characterization on screen catapulted her into a career as a star of comedy films.

Griffith did not use Dorothy in any of his earliest epics, but while he spent months working on &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Intolerance&quot;, Dorothy was featured in many feature-length films made under the banner of Triangle and Mutual releases. They were directed by young Griffith protégés such as Donald Crisp, James Kirkwood, and Christy Cabanne. Elmer Clifton directed a series of seven Paramount-Artcraft comedies with Dorothy that were so successful and popular that the tremendous revenue they raked in helped to pay the cost of Griffith’s expensive epics. These films were wildly popular with the public and the critics. She specialised in pantomime and light comedy, while her sister appeared in tragic roles. Dorothy became famous in this long series of Griffith-supervised films for the Triangle-Fine Arts and Paramount companies from 1918 through 1920, comedies that put her in the front ranks of film comedians. Almost all of these films are now considered to be lost films.

&quot;And So I Am a Comedienne&quot;, an article published in &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; in July 1925, gave Dorothy a chance to recall her public persona: “And so I am a comedienne, though I, too, once wanted to do heroic and tragic things. Today my objection to playing comedy is that it is so often misunderstood by the audiences, both in the theater and in the picture houses. It is so often thought to be a lesser art and something which comes to one naturally, a haphazard talent like the amateur clowning of some cut-up who is so often thought to be ‘the life of the party’. In the eyes of so many persons comedy is not only the absence of studied effect and acting, but it is not considered an art.”

She made a film in England &quot;Nell Gwynn&quot; which led to three more films. Gish earned £41,000 for these movies.

===Sound era and return to stage===
When the film industry converted to talking pictures, Dorothy made one in 1930, the British crime drama &quot;Wolves&quot;. Earlier, in 1928 and 1929, her performances in the Broadway play &quot;Young Love&quot; and her work with director George Cukor renewed her interest in stagecraft and in the immediacy of performing live again. The light comedy had proven to be popular with critics and audiences in New York, in performances on the road in the United States, as well overseas in a London production. Those successes convinced her to take a respite from film-making.
 In 1939, both Dorothy and Lillian Gish found the stage role of a lifetime. “Dorothy and I went to see the New York production of &quot;Life with Father,&quot; starring Howard Lindsay and Dorothy Stickney,” Lillian wrote in her autobiography. “After the performance I said: ‘This is the play we’ve been waiting for to take through America.’” Lillian predicted the popular play would be a perfect showcase for all the people who had seen the hundreds of films featuring Mary Pickford, Dorothy, and herself. She was introduced to Lindsay backstage, and immediately surprised the producers with her enthusiastic desire to head the first company to go on the road, with Dorothy taking the same part for the second road company, and the movie rights for Mary Pickford. Pickford did not make the film version, but the Gish sisters took the two road companies on extensive tours. Another stage success later in Gish&#x27;s career was &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;, which ran on Broadway at the Royale Theatre during the first half of 1946. Lillian in her pictorial book &quot;Dorothy and Lillian Gish&quot; repeats John Chapman&#x27;s comments about her sister&#x27;s work in that production: &quot;&#x27;Miss [Dorothy] Gish and Mr. Calhern give the finest performances I have ever seen them in. She is a delight and a darling.&#x27;&quot;

===Television and final films===
Television in the 1950s offered many stage and film actors the opportunity to perform in plays broadcast live. Dorothy ventured into the new medium, appearing on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; on the evening of November 24, 1955, in a production of &quot;Miss Susie Slagle&#x27;s&quot;. She and Lillian had previously performed that play together on screen, in Paramount Pictures&#x27; 1945 film adaptation.

&quot;The truth is, that she did not know what she really wanted to do,&quot; wrote her sister, Lillian, in her autobiography. &quot;She had always had trouble making decisions and assuming responsibilities, in some ways she had never grown up. She was such a witty and enchanting child that we enjoyed indulging her. First Mother and I spoiled her and later Reba, her friend, and her husband Jim. Reba called Dorothy &#x27;Baby&#x27; and so did Jim. With the best intentions in the world, we all helped to keep her a child.&quot;

From 1930 until her death, she only performed in five more movies, including &quot;Our Hearts Were Young and Gay&quot; (1944), which was a hit for Paramount. Director Otto Preminger cast Dorothy in his 1946 film, &quot;Centennial Summer&quot;, and Mae Marsh appears in the film in one of her many bit parts. In the 1951 release &quot;The Whistle at Eaton Falls&quot;, a film noir drama film produced by Louis de Rochemont, Dorothy portrays the widow of a mill owner. On television during this period, she also made several appearances in anthology television series. Her final film role was in 1963 in another Otto Preminger production, &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, in which she plays the mother of the title character.

==Personal life==
 Dorothy Gish married only once, to James Malachi Rennie (1890–1965), a Canadian-born actor who co-starred with her in two productions in 1920: &quot;Remodeling Her Husband&quot;, directed by sister Lillian, and in the comedy &quot;Flying Pat&quot;. In December 1920, the couple eloped to Greenwich, Connecticut, where they wed in a double ceremony in which Gish&#x27;s friend, actress Constance Talmadge, also married Greek businessman John Pialoglou. Gish and Rennie remained together until their divorce in 1935. Dorothy never married again.

==Death and legacy==
Gish died aged 70 in 1968 from bronchial pneumonia at a clinic in Rapallo, Italy, where she had been a patient for two years to treat hardening arteries. Her sister Lillian, who was filming in Rome, was at her bedside. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the day after her death that the United States consulate in Genoa was making arrangements to cremate &quot;Miss Gish&#x27;s body&quot; for return to the United States. The ashes were later entombed in Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York City in the columbarium in the undercroft of the church. Lillian, who died in 1993, was interred beside her.

In recognition of her contributions to the motion picture industry, in 1960 Dorothy Gish was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6385 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The (since renamed) Gish Film Theatre and Gallery of Bowling Green State University&#x27;s Department of Theatre and Film was named for Lillian and Dorothy Gish and was dedicated on that campus in 1976.

The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize was named for her by her sister. It awards a substantial cash prize annually to &quot;a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind&#x27;s enjoyment and understanding of life.&quot;

<doc id="223929" wikidata="Q5608642" url="?curid=223929" title="Subpoena">
<text>A subpoena (; also subpœna, supenna or subpena) or witness summons is a writ issued by a government agency, most often a court, to compel testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure. There are two common types of subpoenas:
# &quot;subpoena ad testificandum&quot; orders a person to testify before the ordering authority or face punishment. The subpoena can also request the testimony to be given by phone or in person.
# &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot; orders a person or organization to bring physical evidence before the ordering authority or face punishment. This is often used for requests to mail copies of documents to requesting party or directly to court.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;subpoena&quot; is from the Middle English &quot;suppena&quot; and the Latin phrase &quot;sub poena&quot; meaning &quot;under penalty&quot;. It is also spelled &quot;subpena&quot;. The subpoena has its source in English common law and it is now used almost with universal application throughout the English common law world. John Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury, is said to have created the writ of subpoena during the reign of Richard II. However, for civil proceedings in England and Wales, it is now described as a witness summons, as part of reforms to replace Latin terms with Plain English understandable to the layman.

==Process==
=== Australia ===
In New South Wales, a court may set aside the whole, or part, of a subpoena on the basis that it is a &quot;fishing expedition&quot;. In &quot;Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd&quot;, the NSW Court of Appeal held that where documents requested in the schedule of a subpoena are deemed to have no relevance to the proceedings in dispute, the subpoena may be set aside as it has no legitimate forensic purpose. It was also held that it was not the role of the Court to redraft the subpoena and narrow its scope to those issues in dispute. In Victoria a subpoena is usually issued by a court registry officer, and does not require leave of the court.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, subpoenas are governed under the rules of the court in which the subpoena is issued.

=== United States ===
Subpoenas are usually issued by the clerk of the court in the name of the judge presiding over the case. Additionally, court rules may permit lawyers to issue subpoenas themselves in their capacity as officers of the court. Typically subpoenas are issued &quot;in blank&quot; and it is the responsibility of the lawyer representing the party (plaintiff or defendant) on whose behalf the testimony is to be given to serve the subpoena on the witness. If a witness is reluctant to testify, then the personal service of subpoena is usually required with proof of service by non-party server.

The subpoena will usually be on the letterhead of the court where the case is filed, name the parties to the case, and be addressed by name to the person whose testimony is being sought. It will contain the language &quot;You are hereby commanded to report in person to the clerk of this court&quot; or similar, describing the specific location, scheduled date and time of the appearance. Some issuing jurisdictions include an admonishment advising the subject of the criminal penalty for failure to comply with a subpoena, and reminding him or her not to leave the court facilities until excused by a competent authority, often ending with the archaic threat &quot;Fail not at your peril.&quot; In some situations, the person having to testify or produce documents is paid.

&quot;Pro se&quot; litigants who represent themselves, unlike lawyers, must ask a court clerk to officially issue them subpoena forms when they need to call witnesses by phone or in person, or when they need to officially request documents to be sent to them or directly to court. Any documents that have not been subpoenaed to court or verified by a witness may be dismissed by the opposite party as hearsay, unless excepted by hearsay rules or permitted by the judge. If the witness is called via long-distance phone call, then the requesting party is responsible for initiating the call and providing a payment with a prepaid phone card. Most states (including California) have further restrictions on subpoena use in criminal cases.

Some states (as is the case in Florida) require the subpoenaing party to first file a Notice of Intent to Serve Subpoena, or a Notice of Production from Non-Party ten days prior to issuing the subpoena, so that the other party may have ample time to file any objections.

Also, the party being subpoenaed has the right to object to the issuance of the subpoena, if it is for an improper purpose, such as subpoenaing records that have no relevance to the proceedings, or subpoenaing persons who would have no evidence to present, or subpoenaing records or testimony that is confidential or privileged.

Standing committees in both houses of the United States Congress have the authority to send out subpoenas for legitimate lawmaking and investigation purposes. This compels the production of testimony or records, and failure to respond constitutes contempt of Congress.

There are several exceptions to being required to testify in court, including the following examples:

* Fifth Amendment – Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, no person shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. Witnesses cannot be forced to testify if the testimony may incriminate them. This right can, however, be set aside if the witness is granted immunity. This immunity allows them to testify, and makes them immune to prosecution for any crimes they confess to.
* Spousal privilege – In most cases, a person cannot be compelled to testify against their spouse. This rule also exists as a consequence of the Fifth Amendment and the &quot;One flesh&quot; concept of Marriage. Under this rule, since married spouses are joined together as one entity, they cannot be forced to testify against each other. Exceptions to this rule include domestic violence or sexual abuse cases.
* Counselors or Priests – Communication with a counselor or priest is considered privileged, because both jobs require that clients be free to express themselves completely honestly, without fear of consequences.
* Lawyers – In order to provide competent legal advice, clients must be free to express all details to their lawyer. Communication with a lawyer is protected, and a lawyer cannot be forced to testify against a client.
* Doctors – Medical professionals are forbidden from disclosing a patient&#x27;s private medical information without the patient&#x27;s permission, under the law of patient confidentiality. A doctor cannot provide testimony based upon the patient&#x27;s private medical information, and a doctor cannot be compelled to disclose medical records.
* Diplomats – Foreign diplomats can never be forced to testify in court, under diplomatic immunity.
* Incompetent witness or evidence - A witness may have memory or other cognitive deficits, which could affect their ability to truthfully recall events. They also may not be physically fit to appear in court.
* Inadmissible evidence – If the evidence is obtained illegally, it is not admissible in court. For example, someone who sneaks onto private property and overhears a private conversation between two people cannot testify to that conversation in court. The same applies to illegally recorded conversations, illegally taken photos, or other eavesdropped conversations. If a burglar broke into a home and found illicit drugs inside, their testimony to that discovery would not be allowed in court, as it was illegally obtained.

== &quot;Friendly subpoena&quot; ==
A &quot;friendly subpoena&quot; is a subpoena that is issued to an individual or entity who might otherwise testify or submit evidence willingly without a subpoena, but is prevented from doing so due to a higher order legal, ethical or regulatory loyalty or fiduciary responsibility, which can only be superseded by a subpoena. It is called a &quot;friendly&quot; subpoena because the recipient would otherwise be or is very likely to be willing to cooperate with the investigation at issue, once issued a subpoena.

==Conduct money==
Conduct money is money paid in some legal systems to a person under the compulsion of a subpoena to pay for their expenses to attend in court. It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in court (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel allowance to allow the witness to get to the place of the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. In some jurisdictions, however, failure to provide conduct money at the time the summons is served is only an irregularity but not fatal to the validity of the summons. Witnesses are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in court on more than one day are generally entitled to an allowance for accommodation and meals.

The rates for travel, daily attendance, accommodation and meals are generally set under a court tariff, and are fixed for all witnesses. A witness may not refuse to appear merely because they believe the conduct money is insufficient to make up for their lost wages or actual travel expenses. Witnesses may be paid more, but the additional cost cannot be claimed against the losing party – only the tariff amount can be recovered.

Occasionally, special witnesses, such as experts, may be entitled to receive conduct money under a higher tariff. As an example, in the province of Ontario, witnesses in civil proceedings in the Superior Court are allowed a daily rate of 50.00 CAD. The travel allowance is $3.00 if the witness resides in the same city as the hearing; 24 cents per kilometre each way if the hearing is within 400 km (approx. 240 miles); or open ticket coach class airfare, plus 24 cents per kilometre to the nearest airport to both the witness and the place of hearing if the distance is over 400 km. The accommodation and meal allowance is $75.00 per overnight stay for anyone travelling more than a certain distance from the hearing.

<doc id="223938" wikidata="Q977808" url="?curid=223938" title="Nuxalk language">
<text>Nuxalk (, ), also known as Bella Coola , is a Salishan language spoken by the Nuxalk people. Today, it is an endangered language in the vicinity of the Canadian town of Bella Coola, British Columbia. While the language is still sometimes called &quot;Bella Coola&quot; by linguists, the native name &quot;Nuxalk&quot; is preferred by some, notably by the Nuxalk Nation&#x27;s government.

Though the number of truly fluent speakers has not increased, the language is now taught in both the provincial school system and the Nuxalk Nation&#x27;s own school, , which means &quot;a place of learning&quot;. Nuxalk language classes, if taken to at least the Grade 11 level, are considered adequate second-language qualifications for entry to the major B.C. universities. CKNN-FM Nuxalk Radio is also working to promote the language.

==Name==
The name &quot;Nuxalk&quot; for the language comes from the native (or ), referring to the &quot;Bella Coola Valley&quot;. &quot;Bella Coola&quot; is a rendering of the Heiltsuk , meaning &quot;stranger&quot;.

==Geographical distribution==
Nowadays, Nuxalk is spoken only in Bella Coola, British Columbia, surrounded by Wakashan- and Athabascan-speaking tribes. It was once spoken in over 100 settlements, with varying dialects, but in the present day most of these settlements have been abandoned and dialectal differences have largely disappeared.

==Classification==
Nuxalk forms its own subgroup of the Salish language family. Its lexicon is equidistant from Coast and Interior Salish, but it shares phonological and morphological features with Coast Salish (e.g., the absence of pharyngeals and the presence of marked gender). Nuxalk also borrows many words from contiguous North Wakashan languages (especially Heiltsuk), as well as some from neighbouring Athabaskan languages and Tsimshian.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Nuxalk has 29 consonants depicted below in IPA and the Americanist orthography of Davis &amp; Saunders when it differs from the IPA.

What are transcribed in the orthography as &#x27;plain&#x27; velar consonants are actually palatals, and the sibilants &#x27; palatalize to &#x27; before &quot;&quot;.

===Vowels===

====Allophony====

 may be pronounced:

* before postvelars
* between postvelars
* , before a sonorant followed by a consonant or word boundary
* adjacent to palatovelars
* elsewhere

 may be pronounced:

* (?) surrounded by postvelars
* before rounded velars followed by a consonant or word boundary
* (?) before a sonorant followed by a consonant or word boundary
* elsewhere

 may be pronounced:

* surrounded by postvelars
* before a sonorant followed by a consonant or word boundary
* before rounded velars followed by a consonant or word boundary
* elsewhere

=== Orthography ===
In addition to the Americanist orthography of Davis &amp; Saunders used in this article for clarity, Nuxalk also has a non-diacritical Bouchard-type practical orthography that originated in Hank Nater&#x27;s &quot;The Bella Coola Language&quot; (1984), and was used in his 1990 &quot;Nuxalk-English Dictionary&quot;. It continues to be used today at for Nuxalk language learning, as well as in Nuxalk documents and names. The orthographic variants are summarized below.
== Syllables ==
The notion of syllable is challenged by the Nuxalk language, in that the language includes long strings of consonants without any intervening vowel or other sonorant. Salishan languages, and especially Nuxalk, are famous for this. For instance, the following word contains only obstruents:

Other examples are:

* &#x27;shape, mold&#x27;
* &#x27;bend&#x27;
* &#x27;bunchberry&#x27;
* &#x27;he arrived&#x27;
* &#x27;little boy&#x27;
* &#x27;saliva&#x27;
* &#x27;northeast wind&#x27;
* &#x27;cut with scissors&#x27;
* &#x27;animal fat&#x27;
* &#x27;that&#x27;s my animal fat over there&#x27;
* &#x27;seal fat&#x27;
* &#x27;strong&#x27;
* &#x27;go to shore&#x27;
* &#x27;crooked&#x27;
* &#x27;you had seen that I had gone through a passage&#x27;

There has been some dispute as to how to count the syllables in such words, what, if anything, constitutes the nuclei of those syllables, and if the concept of &#x27;syllable&#x27; is even applicable to Nuxalk. However, when recordings are available, the syllable structure can be clearly audible, and speakers have clear conceptions as to how many syllables a word contains. In general, a syllable may be , (where F is a fricative), , or . When C is a stop, CF syllables are always composed of a plain voiceless stop (&#x27;) plus a fricative (&#x27;). For example, &#x27; &#x27;thick&#x27; is two syllables, &#x27;, with a syllabic fricative, while in &#x27; &#x27;stone&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;salt&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;crooked&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;to see&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;wet&#x27; each consonant is a separate syllable. Stop-fricative sequences can also be disyllabic, however, as in &#x27; &#x27;strong&#x27; (two syllables, at least in the cited recording) and &#x27; &#x27;rough&#x27; (one syllable or two). Syllabification of stop-fricative sequences may therefore be lexicalized or a prosodic tendency. Fricative-fricative sequences also have a tendency toward syllabicity, e.g. with &#x27; &#x27;bad&#x27; being one syllable or two, and &#x27; &#x27;seal fat&#x27; being two syllables (&#x27;) or three. Speech rate plays a role, with e.g. &#x27; &#x27;you spat on me&#x27; consisting of all syllabic consonants in citation form (&#x27;) but condensed to stop-fricative syllables (&quot;&quot;) at fast conversational speed.
This syllabic structure may be compared with that of Miyako.

The linguist Hank Nater has postulated the existence of a phonemic contrast between syllabic and non-syllabic sonorants: , spelled &quot;ṃ, ṇ, ḷ&quot;. (The vowel phonemes would then be the syllabic counterparts of .) Words claimed to have unpredictable syllables include &#x27;mute&#x27;, &#x27;(the fact) that they are children&#x27;.

== Grammar ==

=== Events ===

The first element in a sentence expresses the event of the proposition. It inflects for the person and number of one (in the intransitive paradigm) or two (in the transitive paradigm) participants.

E.g. &#x27;the dog is running&#x27;.

Whether the parenthesized segments are included in the suffix depends on whether the stem ends in an underlying resonant (vowel, liquid, nasal) and whether it is non-syllabic. So &#x27;drink&#x27; becomes &#x27;we drink&#x27;, &#x27;you (pl.) drink&#x27;, &#x27;they drink&#x27;, but &#x27;sing&#x27; becomes &#x27;we&#x27;re singing&#x27;, &#x27;you (pl.) are singing&#x27;, &#x27;they&#x27;re singing&#x27;.

However, the choice of the 3ps marker -Ø or - is conditioned by semantics rather than phonetics. For example, the sentences and could both be glossed &#x27;it&#x27;s the man&#x27;, but the first is appropriate if the man is the one who is normally chosen, while the second is making an assertion that it is the &quot;man&quot; (as opposed to someone else, as might otherwise be thought) who is chosen.

The following are the possible person markers for transitive verbs, with empty cells indications non-occurring combinations and &#x27;--&#x27; identifying semantic combinations which require the reflexive suffix followed by the appropriate intransitive suffix:

E.g. &#x27;the man struck the tree&#x27;.

Whether a word can serve as an event is not determined lexically, e.g. &#x27;the thief is a boy&#x27;, &#x27;the one who is ill is a thief&#x27;.

There is a further causative paradigm whose suffixes may be used instead:

This has a passive counterpart:

This may also have a benefactive gloss when used with events involving less activity of their participant (e.g. &#x27;the man made/let the boy sing&#x27;/&#x27;the man sang for the boy&#x27;), while in events with more active participants only the causative gloss is possible. In the later group even more active verbs have a preference for the affix (implying passive experience) before the causative suffix.

The executor in a transitive sentence always precedes the experiencer. However, when an event is proceeded by a lone participant, the semantic content of the event determines whether the participant is an executor or an experiencer. This can only be determined syntactically if the participant is marked by the preposition , which marks the experience.

Some events are inherently transitive or intransitive, but some may accept multiple valencies (e.g. &#x27;to be needy&#x27;/&#x27;to want [something]&#x27;).

Prepositions may mark experiencers, and must mark implements. Any participants which are not marked by prepositions are focussed. There are three voices, which allow either the executor, the experiencer, or both to have focus:

* Active voice – neither is marked with prepositions.
* Passive voice – the event may have different suffixes, and the executor may be omitted or marked with a preposition
* Antipassive voice – the event is marked with the affix before personal markers, and the experiencer is marked with a preposition

The affix ( after the antipassive marker ) allows an implement to have its preposition removed and to be focused. For example:
* &#x27;the father sang the song to his son&#x27;
* &#x27;the father sang the song to his son&#x27;

=== Prepositions ===

There are four prepositions which have broad usage in Nuxalk:

=== Deixis ===

Nuxalk has a set of deictic prefixes and suffixes which serve to identify items as instantiations of domains rather than domains themselves and to locate them in deictic space. Thus the sentences and , both &#x27;the one that&#x27;s running is a dog&#x27;, are slightly different – similar to the difference between the English sentences &#x27;the visitor is Canadian&#x27; and &#x27;the visitor is a Canadian&#x27; respectively.

The deixis system has a proximal/medial/distal and a non-demonstrative/demonstrative distinction. Demonstratives may be used when finger pointing would be appropriate (or in distal space when something previously mentioned is being referred to).

Proximal demonstrative space roughly corresponds to the area of conversation, and proximal non-demonstrative may be viewed as the area in which one could attract another&#x27;s attention without raising one&#x27;s voice. Visible space beyond this is middle demonstrative, space outside of this but within the invisible neighborhood is medial non-demonstrative. Everything else is distal, and non-demonstrative if not mentioned earlier.

The deictic prefixes and suffixes are as follows:

Female affixes are used only when the particular is singular and identified as female; if not, even if the particular is inanimate, masculine or plural is used.

The deictic prefixes only have a proximal vs. non-proximal distinction, and no demonstrative distinction:

 is used in earlier varieties and some types of narratives, except for middle non-demonstrative, and the variant may be used &quot;in the same collection of deictic space&quot;.

While events are not explicitly marked for tense per se, deixis plays a strong role in determining when the proposition is being asserted to occur. So in a sentence like &#x27;the boy felt that rope&#x27;, the sentence is perceived as having a near-past (same day) interpretation, as the boy cannot be touching the rope in middle space from proximal space. However this does not hold for some events, like &#x27;to see&#x27;.

A distal suffix on any participant lends the event a distant past interpretation (before the past day), a medial suffix and no distal suffix lends a near past time, and if the participants are marked as proximal the time is present.

Not every distal participant occurs in past-tense sentences, and vice versa—rather, the deictic suffixes must &quot;either&quot; represent positions in space, time, &quot;or&quot; both.

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns are reportedly nonexistent but the idea is expressed via verbs that translate as &quot;to be me&quot;, etc.

=== Particles ===

<doc id="223942" wikidata="Q14645" url="?curid=223942" title="Rootkit">
<text>A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software. The term &quot;rootkit&quot; is a compound of &quot;root&quot; (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word &quot;kit&quot; (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term &quot;rootkit&quot; has negative connotations through its association with malware.

Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or administrator access. Obtaining this access is a result of direct attack on a system, i.e. exploiting a vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like &quot;phishing&quot;). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.

Rootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavior-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.

==History==
The term &quot;rootkit&quot;, &quot;rkit&quot;, or &quot;root kit&quot; originally referred to a maliciously modified set of administrative tools for a Unix-like operating system that granted &quot;root&quot; access. If an intruder could replace the standard administrative tools on a system with a rootkit, the intruder could obtain root access over the system whilst simultaneously concealing these activities from the legitimate system administrator. These first-generation rootkits were trivial to detect by using tools such as Tripwire that had not been compromised to access the same information. Lane Davis and Steven Dake wrote the earliest known rootkit in 1990 for Sun Microsystems&#x27; SunOS UNIX operating system. In the lecture he gave upon receiving the Turing Award in 1983, Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, one of the creators of Unix, theorized about subverting the C compiler in a Unix distribution and discussed the exploit. The modified compiler would detect attempts to compile the Unix codice_1 command and generate altered code that would accept not only the user&#x27;s correct password, but an additional &quot;backdoor&quot; password known to the attacker. Additionally, the compiler would detect attempts to compile a new version of the compiler, and would insert the same exploits into the new compiler. A review of the source code for the codice_1 command or the updated compiler would not reveal any malicious code. This exploit was equivalent to a rootkit.

The first documented computer virus to target the personal computer, discovered in 1986, used cloaking techniques to hide itself: the Brain virus intercepted attempts to read the boot sector, and redirected these to elsewhere on the disk, where a copy of the original boot sector was kept.
Over time, DOS-virus cloaking methods became more sophisticated. Advanced techniques included hooking low-level disk INT 13H BIOS interrupt calls to hide unauthorized modifications to files.

The first malicious rootkit for the Windows NT operating system appeared in 1999: a trojan called &quot;NTRootkit&quot; created by Greg Hoglund. It was followed by &quot;HackerDefender&quot; in 2003. The first rootkit targeting Mac OS X appeared in 2009, while the Stuxnet worm was the first to target programmable logic controllers (PLC).

===Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal===
In 2005, Sony BMG published CDs with copy protection and digital rights management software called Extended Copy Protection, created by software company First 4 Internet. The software included a music player but silently installed a rootkit which limited the user&#x27;s ability to access the CD. Software engineer Mark Russinovich, who created the rootkit detection tool RootkitRevealer, discovered the rootkit on one of his computers. The ensuing scandal raised the public&#x27;s awareness of rootkits. To cloak itself, the rootkit hid any file starting with &quot;$sys$&quot; from the user. Soon after Russinovich&#x27;s report, malware appeared which took advantage of the existing rootkit on affected systems. One BBC analyst called it a &quot;public relations nightmare.&quot; Sony BMG released patches to uninstall the rootkit, but it exposed users to an even more serious vulnerability. The company eventually recalled the CDs. In the United States, a class-action lawsuit was brought against Sony BMG.

===Greek wiretapping case 2004–05===
The Greek wiretapping case 2004–05, also referred to as Greek Watergate, involved the illegal telephone tapping of more than 100 mobile phones on the Vodafone Greece network belonging mostly to members of the Greek government and top-ranking civil servants. The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson&#x27;s AXE telephone exchange. According to &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot;, this was &quot;the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch.&quot; The rootkit was designed to patch the memory of the exchange while it was running, enable wiretapping while disabling audit logs, patch the commands that list active processes and active data blocks, and modify the data block checksum verification command. A &quot;backdoor&quot; allowed an operator with sysadmin status to deactivate the exchange&#x27;s transaction log, alarms and access commands related to the surveillance capability. The rootkit was discovered after the intruders installed a faulty update, which caused SMS texts to be undelivered, leading to an automated failure report being generated. Ericsson engineers were called in to investigate the fault and discovered the hidden data blocks containing the list of phone numbers being monitored, along with the rootkit and illicit monitoring software.

==Uses==
Modern rootkits do not elevate access, but rather are used to make another software payload undetectable by adding stealth capabilities. Most rootkits are classified as malware, because the payloads they are bundled with are malicious. For example, a payload might covertly steal user passwords, credit card information, computing resources, or conduct other unauthorized activities. A small number of rootkits may be considered utility applications by their users: for example, a rootkit might cloak a CD-ROM-emulation driver, allowing video game users to defeat anti-piracy measures that require insertion of the original installation media into a physical optical drive to verify that the software was legitimately purchased.

Rootkits and their payloads have many uses:
*Provide an attacker with full access via a backdoor, permitting unauthorized access to, for example, steal or falsify documents. One of the ways to carry this out is to subvert the login mechanism, such as the /bin/login program on Unix-like systems or GINA on Windows. The replacement appears to function normally, but also accepts a secret login combination that allows an attacker direct access to the system with administrative privileges, bypassing standard authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*Conceal other malware, notably password-stealing key loggers and computer viruses.
*Appropriate the compromised machine as a zombie computer for attacks on other computers. (The attack originates from the compromised system or network, instead of the attacker&#x27;s system.) &quot;Zombie&quot; computers are typically members of large botnets that can–amongst other things–launch denial-of-service attacks, distribute email spam, and conduct click fraud.

In some instances, rootkits provide desired functionality, and may be installed intentionally on behalf of the computer user:
*Detect attacks, for example, in a honeypot.
*Enhance emulation software and security software. Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools are commercial examples of non-hostile rootkits used to defeat copy-protection mechanisms such as SafeDisc and SecuROM. Kaspersky antivirus software also uses techniques resembling rootkits to protect itself from malicious actions. It loads its own drivers to intercept system activity, and then prevents other processes from doing harm to itself. Its processes are not hidden, but cannot be terminated by standard methods.
*Anti-theft protection: Laptops may have BIOS-based rootkit software that will periodically report to a central authority, allowing the laptop to be monitored, disabled or wiped of information in the event that it is stolen.
*Bypassing Microsoft Product Activation

==Types==

There are at least five types of rootkit, ranging from those at the lowest level in firmware (with the highest privileges), through to the least privileged user-based variants that operate in Ring 3. Hybrid combinations of these may occur spanning, for example, user mode and kernel mode.

===User mode===

User-mode rootkits run in Ring 3, along with other applications as user, rather than low-level system processes. They have a number of possible installation vectors to intercept and modify the standard behavior of application programming interfaces (APIs). Some inject a dynamically linked library (such as a .DLL file on Windows, or a .dylib file on Mac OS X) into other processes, and are thereby able to execute inside any target process to spoof it; others with sufficient privileges simply overwrite the memory of a target application. Injection mechanisms include:
*Use of vendor-supplied application extensions. For example, Windows Explorer has public interfaces that allow third parties to extend its functionality.
*Interception of messages.
*Debuggers.
*Exploitation of security vulnerabilities.
*Function hooking or patching of commonly used APIs, for example, to hide a running process or file that resides on a filesystem.
===Kernel mode===
Kernel-mode rootkits run with the highest operating system privileges (Ring 0) by adding code or replacing portions of the core operating system, including both the kernel and associated device drivers. Most operating systems support kernel-mode device drivers, which execute with the same privileges as the operating system itself. As such, many kernel-mode rootkits are developed as device drivers or loadable modules, such as loadable kernel modules in Linux or device drivers in Microsoft Windows. This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but is more difficult to write. The complexity makes bugs common, and any bugs in code operating at the kernel level may seriously impact system stability, leading to discovery of the rootkit. One of the first widely known kernel rootkits was developed for Windows NT 4.0 and released in &quot;Phrack&quot; magazine in 1999 by Greg Hoglund. Kernel rootkits can be especially difficult to detect and remove because they operate at the same security level as the operating system itself, and are thus able to intercept or subvert the most trusted operating system operations. Any software, such as antivirus software, running on the compromised system is equally vulnerable. In this situation, no part of the system can be trusted.

A rootkit can modify data structures in the Windows kernel using a method known as &quot;direct kernel object manipulation&quot; (DKOM). This method can be used to hide processes. A kernel mode rootkit can also hook the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), or modify the gates between user mode and kernel mode, in order to cloak itself. Similarly for the Linux operating system, a rootkit can modify the &quot;system call table&quot; to subvert kernel functionality. It is common that a rootkit creates a hidden, encrypted filesystem in which it can hide other malware or original copies of files it has infected. Operating systems are evolving to counter the threat of kernel-mode rootkits. For example, 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows now implement mandatory signing of all kernel-level drivers in order to make it more difficult for untrusted code to execute with the highest privileges in a system.

====Bootkits====
A kernel-mode rootkit variant called a bootkit can infect startup code like the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), or boot sector, and in this way can be used to attack full disk encryption systems.
An example of such an attack on disk encryption is the &quot;evil maid attack&quot;, in which an attacker installs a bootkit on an unattended computer. The envisioned scenario is a maid sneaking into the hotel room where the victims left their hardware. The bootkit replaces the legitimate boot loader with one under their control. Typically the malware loader persists through the transition to protected mode when the kernel has loaded, and is thus able to subvert the kernel. For example, the &quot;Stoned Bootkit&quot; subverts the system by using a compromised boot loader to intercept encryption keys and passwords. In 2010, the Alureon rootkit has successfully subverted the requirement for 64-bit kernel-mode driver signing in Windows 7, by modifying the master boot record. Although not malware in the sense of doing something the user doesn&#x27;t want, certain &quot;Vista Loader&quot; or &quot;Windows Loader&quot; software work in a similar way by injecting an ACPI SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) table in the RAM-cached version of the BIOS during boot, in order to defeat the Windows Vista and Windows 7 activation process. This vector of attack was rendered useless in the (non-server) versions of Windows 8, which use a unique, machine-specific key for each system, that can only be used by that one machine. Many antivirus companies provide free utilities and programs to remove bootkits.

===Hypervisor level===
Rootkits have been created as Type II Hypervisors in academia as proofs of concept. By exploiting hardware virtualization features such as Intel VT or AMD-V, this type of rootkit runs in Ring -1 and hosts the target operating system as a virtual machine, thereby enabling the rootkit to intercept hardware calls made by the original operating system. Unlike normal hypervisors, they do not have to load before the operating system, but can load into an operating system before promoting it into a virtual machine. A hypervisor rootkit does not have to make any modifications to the kernel of the target to subvert it; however, that does not mean that it cannot be detected by the guest operating system. For example, timing differences may be detectable in CPU instructions. The &quot;SubVirt&quot; laboratory rootkit, developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers, is an academic example of a virtual-machine–based rootkit (VMBR),
while Blue Pill software is another. In 2009, researchers from Microsoft and North Carolina State University demonstrated a hypervisor-layer anti-rootkit called Hooksafe, which provides generic protection against kernel-mode rootkits. Windows 10 introduced a new feature called &quot;Device Guard&quot;, that takes advantage of virtualization to provide independent external protection of an operating system against rootkit-type malware.

===Firmware and hardware===
A firmware rootkit uses device or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit-card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.

Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, implements out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, and remote control of PCs with no involvement of the host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have &quot;the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G&quot;. Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.

==Installation and cloaking==
Rootkits employ a variety of techniques to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of attack vector. The most common technique leverages security vulnerabilities to achieve surreptitious privilege escalation. Another approach is to use a Trojan horse, deceiving a computer user into trusting the rootkit&#x27;s installation program as benign—in this case, social engineering convinces a user that the rootkit is beneficial. The installation task is made easier if the principle of least privilege is not applied, since the rootkit then does not have to explicitly request elevated (administrator-level) privileges. Other classes of rootkits can be installed only by someone with physical access to the target system. Some rootkits may also be installed intentionally by the owner of the system or somebody authorized by the owner, e.g. for the purpose of employee monitoring, rendering such subversive techniques unnecessary. Some malicious rootkit installations are commercially driven, with a pay-per-install (PPI) compensation method typical for distribution.

Once installed, a rootkit takes active measures to obscure its presence within the host system through subversion or evasion of standard operating system security tools and application programming interface (APIs) used for diagnosis, scanning, and monitoring. Rootkits achieve this by modifying the behavior of core parts of an operating system through loading code into other processes, the installation or modification of drivers, or kernel modules. Obfuscation techniques include concealing running processes from system-monitoring mechanisms and hiding system files and other configuration data. It is not uncommon for a rootkit to disable the event logging capacity of an operating system, in an attempt to hide evidence of an attack. Rootkits can, in theory, subvert &quot;any&quot; operating system activities. The &quot;perfect rootkit&quot; can be thought of as similar to a &quot;perfect crime&quot;: one that nobody realizes has taken place. Rootkits also take a number of measures to ensure their survival against detection and &quot;cleaning&quot; by antivirus software in addition to commonly installing into Ring 0 (kernel-mode), where they have complete access to a system. These include polymorphism (changing so their &quot;signature&quot; is hard to detect), stealth techniques, regeneration, disabling or turning off anti-malware software, and not installing on virtual machines where it may be easier for researchers to discover and analyze them.

==Detection==
The fundamental problem with rootkit detection is that if the operating system has been subverted, particularly by a kernel-level rootkit, it cannot be trusted to find unauthorized modifications to itself or its components. Actions such as requesting a list of running processes, or a list of files in a directory, cannot be trusted to behave as expected. In other words, rootkit detectors that work while running on infected systems are only effective against rootkits that have some defect in their camouflage, or that run with lower user-mode privileges than the detection software in the kernel. As with computer viruses, the detection and elimination of rootkits is an ongoing struggle between both sides of this conflict. Detection can take a number of different approaches, including looking for virus &quot;signatures&quot; (e.g. antivirus software), integrity checking (e.g. digital signatures), difference-based detection (comparison of expected vs. actual results), and behavioral detection (e.g. monitoring CPU usage or network traffic).

For kernel-mode rootkits, detection is considerably more complex, requiring careful scrutiny of the System Call Table to look for hooked functions where the malware may be subverting system behavior, as well as forensic scanning of memory for patterns that indicate hidden processes. Unix rootkit detection offerings include Zeppoo, chkrootkit, rkhunter and OSSEC. For Windows, detection tools include Microsoft Sysinternals RootkitRevealer, Avast Antivirus, Sophos Anti-Rootkit, F-Secure, Radix, GMER, and WindowsSCOPE. Any rootkit detectors that prove effective ultimately contribute to their own ineffectiveness, as malware authors adapt and test their code to escape detection by well-used tools. Detection by examining storage while the suspect operating system is not operational can miss rootkits not recognised by the checking software, as the rootkit is not active and suspicious behavior is suppressed; conventional anti-malware software running with the rootkit operational may fail if the rootkit hides itself effectively.

===Alternative trusted medium===
The best and most reliable method for operating-system-level rootkit detection is to shut down the computer suspected of infection, and then to check its storage by booting from an alternative trusted medium (e.g. a &quot;rescue&quot; CD-ROM or USB flash drive). The technique is effective because a rootkit cannot actively hide its presence if it is not running.

===Behavioral-based===
The behavioral-based approach to detecting rootkits attempts to infer the presence of a rootkit by looking for rootkit-like behavior. For example, by profiling a system, differences in the timing and frequency of API calls or in overall CPU utilization can be attributed to a rootkit. The method is complex and is hampered by a high incidence of false positives. Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce very obvious changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code. Logs from a packet analyzer, firewall, or intrusion prevention system may present evidence of rootkit behaviour in a networked environment.

===Signature-based===
Antivirus products rarely catch all viruses in public tests (depending on what is used and to what extent), even though security software vendors incorporate rootkit detection into their products. Should a rootkit attempt to hide during an antivirus scan, a stealth detector may notice; if the rootkit attempts to temporarily unload itself from the system, signature detection (or &quot;fingerprinting&quot;) can still find it. This combined approach forces attackers to implement counterattack mechanisms, or &quot;retro&quot; routines, that attempt to terminate antivirus programs. Signature-based detection methods can be effective against well-published rootkits, but less so against specially crafted, custom-root rootkits.

===Difference-based===
Another method that can detect rootkits compares &quot;trusted&quot; raw data with &quot;tainted&quot; content returned by an API. For example, binaries present on disk can be compared with their copies within operating memory (in some operating systems, the in-memory image should be identical to the on-disk image), or the results returned from file system or Windows Registry APIs can be checked against raw structures on the underlying physical disks—however, in the case of the former, some valid differences can be introduced by operating system mechanisms like memory relocation or shimming. A rootkit may detect the presence of such a difference-based scanner or virtual machine (the latter being commonly used to perform forensic analysis), and adjust its behaviour so that no differences can be detected. Difference-based detection was used by Russinovich&#x27;s &quot;RootkitRevealer&quot; tool to find the Sony DRM rootkit.

===Integrity checking===

Code signing uses public-key infrastructure to check if a file has been modified since being digitally signed by its publisher. Alternatively, a system owner or administrator can use a cryptographic hash function to compute a &quot;fingerprint&quot; at installation time that can help to detect subsequent unauthorized changes to on-disk code libraries. However, unsophisticated schemes check only whether the code has been modified since installation time; subversion prior to that time is not detectable. The fingerprint must be re-established each time changes are made to the system: for example, after installing security updates or a service pack. The hash function creates a &quot;message digest&quot;, a relatively short code calculated from each bit in the file using an algorithm that creates large changes in the message digest with even smaller changes to the original file. By recalculating and comparing the message digest of the installed files at regular intervals against a trusted list of message digests, changes in the system can be detected and monitored—as long as the original baseline was created before the malware was added.

More-sophisticated rootkits are able to subvert the verification process by presenting an unmodified copy of the file for inspection, or by making code modifications only in memory, reconfiguration registers, which are later compared to a white list of expected values. The code that performs hash, compare, or extend operations must also be protected—in this context, the notion of an &quot;immutable root-of-trust&quot; holds that the very first code to measure security properties of a system must itself be trusted to ensure that a rootkit or bootkit does not compromise the system at its most fundamental level.

===Memory dumps===
Forcing a complete dump of virtual memory will capture an active rootkit (or a kernel dump in the case of a kernel-mode rootkit), allowing offline forensic analysis to be performed with a debugger against the resulting dump file, without the rootkit being able to take any measures to cloak itself. This technique is highly specialized, and may require access to non-public source code or debugging symbols. Memory dumps initiated by the operating system cannot always be used to detect a hypervisor-based rootkit, which is able to intercept and subvert the lowest-level attempts to read memory—a hardware device, such as one that implements a non-maskable interrupt, may be required to dump memory in this scenario. Virtual machines also make it easier to analyze the memory of a compromised machine from the underlying hypervisor, so some rootkits will avoid infecting virtual machines for this reason.

==Removal==
Manual removal of a rootkit is often extremely difficult for a typical computer user, but a number of security-software vendors offer tools to automatically detect and remove some rootkits, typically as part of an antivirus suite. , Microsoft&#x27;s monthly Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is able to detect and remove some classes of rootkits. Also, Windows Defender Offline can remove rootkits, as it runs from a trusted environment before the operating system starts. Some antivirus scanners can bypass file system APIs, which are vulnerable to manipulation by a rootkit. Instead, they access raw file system structures directly, and use this information to validate the results from the system APIs to identify any differences that may be caused by a rootkit. There are experts who believe that the only reliable way to remove them is to re-install the operating system from trusted media. This is because antivirus and malware removal tools running on an untrusted system may be ineffective against well-written kernel-mode rootkits. Booting an alternative operating system from trusted media can allow an infected system volume to be mounted and potentially safely cleaned and critical data to be copied off—or, alternatively, a forensic examination performed. Lightweight operating systems such as Windows PE, Windows Recovery Console, Windows Recovery Environment, BartPE, or Live Distros can be used for this purpose, allowing the system to be &quot;cleaned&quot;. Even if the type and nature of a rootkit is known, manual repair may be impractical, while re-installing the operating system and applications is safer, simpler and quicker.

==Defenses==
System hardening represents one of the first layers of defence against a rootkit, to prevent it from being able to install. Applying security patches, implementing the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface and installing antivirus software are some standard security best practices that are effective against all classes of malware. New secure boot specifications like UEFI have been designed to address the threat of bootkits, but even these are vulnerable if the security features they offer are not utilized. For server systems, remote server attestation using technologies such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) provide a way of verifying that servers remain in a known good state. For example, Microsoft Bitlocker&#x27;s encryption of data-at-rest verifies that servers are in a known &quot;good state&quot; on bootup. PrivateCore vCage is a software offering that secures data-in-use (memory) to avoid bootkits and rootkits by verifying servers are in a known &quot;good&quot; state on bootup. The PrivateCore implementation works in concert with Intel TXT and locks down server system interfaces to avoid potential bootkits and rootkits.

Another defense mechanism called the Virtual Wall (VTW) approach, serves as a lightweight hypervisor with rootkit detection and event tracing capabilities. In normal operation (guest mode), Linux runs, and when a loaded LKM violates security policies, the system switches to host mode. The VTW in host mode detects, traces, and classifies rootkit events based on memory access control and event injection mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate the VTW&#x27;s effectiveness in timely detection and defense against kernel rootkits with minimal CPU overhead (less than 2%). The VTW is compared favorably to other defense schemes, emphasizing its simplicity in implementation and potential performance gains on Linux servers.

<doc id="223949" wikidata="Q458106" url="?curid=223949" title="Yankee Station">
<text>Yankee Station (officially Point Yankee) was a fixed coordinate off the coast of Vietnam where U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and support ships operated in open waters over a nine-year period during the Vietnam War. The location was used primarily by aircraft carriers of Task Force 77 to launch strikes over North Vietnam. While the coordinate&#x27;s official designation was &quot;Point Yankee&quot;, it was universally referred to as Yankee Station. Carriers conducting air operations at Yankee Station were said to be &quot;on the line&quot; (in combat) and statistical summaries were based on days on the line. Yankee Station was initially located at 16° 00′ N, 110° 00′ E, however with a massive increase in operations over North Vietnam in 1966 the station was moved about 145 miles (230 km) northwest to 17° 30′ N, 108° 30′ E, placing it about 90 miles (145 km) from the North Vietnamese shore.

==Yankee Team beginnings==

The name derived from it being the geographic reference point &quot;Y&quot;, pronounced &quot;Yankee&quot; in the NATO phonetic alphabet. In turn the term Point Yankee derived from the launch point for &quot;Yankee Team&quot; aerial reconnaissance missions over Laos conducted in 1964. The first ship operations at Point Yankee took place in April 1964. Starting 13 April 1966 Yankee Station was moved further toward the Gulf of Tonkin at 17° 30&#x27; N and 108° 30&#x27; E, about 190 km due east of Đồng Hới.

Early missions were flown in the Kingdom of Laos during the Laotian Civil War. Begun 19 May 1964 as medium and low level U.S. Navy photo reconnaissance missions over the Plain of Jars, it was soon ramped up to &quot;armed reconnaissance&quot; covered by U.S. Air Force F-100 Super Sabre fighter escorts from Tan Son Nhut. The classified operation was dubbed Yankee Team on 25 May 1964. Notice of their non-emergency sorties was forwarded from CINCPAC to Washington 36 hours in advance for possible cancellation. A command post was set up in 2nd Air Division headquarters. A U.S. Air Force liaison officer was posted to to coordinate the naval aviators with Air Force operations; in turn, a party of five naval personnel were detailed to the command post.

Committed to a mission in which half the planes drew ground fire, and lacking a formal combat search and rescue backup, the mission suffered its first loss on 6 June 1964 when Lieutenant Charles F. Klusman was shot down while flying at 1,200 feet. Air America attempted rescue without success. Flak suppression protocols had not yet been figured out; use of napalm, the most successful counter to anti-aircraft batteries, was banned by the American ambassador to Laos, Leonard Unger. A second plane went down during the would-be CSAR.

After settling into secretive run air strikes against communist infiltrators into Laos, Yankee Team morphed into Operation Barrel Roll.

==Yankee Station continues the fight==

During the two periods of sustained air operations against North Vietnam (2 March 1965 to 31 October 1968, and 30 March 1972 to 29 December 1972) there were normally three carriers on the line, each conducting air operations for twelve hours, then off for twelve hours. One of the carriers would operate in Vietnam territorial waters from noon to midnight, another from midnight to noon, and one during daylight hours, which gave 24-hour coverage plus additional effort during daylight hours, when sorties were most effective. However at the end of May, 1972, six carriers were for a short period of time on the line at Yankee Station conducting Linebacker and Linebacker II strikes.

The first aircraft carrier at Yankee Station was &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, which was ordered there in April 1964 for the Yankee Team missions. &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was joined by in May and in June, two months prior to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot; launched the first bombing missions from Yankee Station on 5 August 1964. &quot;Constellation&quot; was also the last carrier conducting operations at Yankee Station on August 15, 1973. suffered a major accident while at Yankee Station when a series of fires and explosions on her deck killed 134 men and injured another 161.

A corresponding Dixie Station in the South China Sea off the Mekong Delta was a single carrier point for conducting strikes within South Vietnam from 15 May 1965 to 3 August 1966.

<text>Ghantasala Venkateswararao (4 December 1922 – 11 February 1974), known mononymously by his surname as Ghantasala, was an Indian playback singer and film composer known for his works predominantly in Telugu and Kannada cinema and also in Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu and Hindi language films. He is considered one of the greatest singers of Telugu and Indian cinema. In 1970, he received the Padma Shri award, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award for his contribution to Indian cinema. According to &quot;The Hindu&quot; and &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, Ghantasala was &#x27;such a divine talent and with his songs he could move the hearts of the people&#x27;. &#x27;Ghantasala&#x27;s blending of classical improvisations to the art of light music combined with his virtuosity and sensitivity puts him a class apart, above all others in the field of playback singing&#x27;. Gifted with what Indian film historian V. A. K. Ranga Rao called &#x27;the most majestic voice&#x27;, Ghantasala helped Telugu film music develop its own distinct character which remains unparalleled. He is referred to as the &#x27;Gaana Gandharva&#x27; for his mesmerising voice and musical skills.

Ghantasala performed in the United States, England and Germany, and for the United Nations Organisation. The government of Andhra Pradesh marked the occasion of 25 years of his film career as &quot;Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Ghantasala&quot; in Hyderabad on 1 February 1970. More than 30,000 people attended the function held at the Lal Bahadur Stadium, Hyderabad. Ghantasala continues to be popular. Statutes of his likeness have been installed across Andhra Pradesh. Every year, the anniversaries of his birth and death are celebrated in India and overseas.

==Early life==
Ghantasala was born in 1922 into a Telugu Brahmin family of Ghantasala Soorayya, a professional singer in Chowtapalli, a village in Gudivada taluk of Krishna District. During his childhood, Ghantasala used to dance to his father&#x27;s Tharangams. His father died when Ghantasala was a child, and he was brought up by his maternal uncle. He took formal music training from Patrayani Sitarama Sastry, and joined Maharajah&#x27;s Government College of Music and Dance in Vijayanagram.

==Career==
Ghantasala participated in the Quit India Movement of 1942, for which he was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months at the Alipore (Allipura) Jail, Ballari. After leaving jail, he met Samudrala Sr., who advised him to try his luck in the film industry as a singer. Ghantasala married Savitri, who lived in a village called Pedapulivarru. In that village, Ghantasala met lyricist Samudrala Sr., who was impressed with his voice and inducted him into the Madras film industry. Before Ghantasala found fame, he was already an accomplished Carnatic music singer.

Ghantasala&#x27;s first break as a singer came from All India Radio. Later on, Peketi Siva Ram from HMV studios recorded Ghantasala&#x27;s private songs. Ghantasala debuted as a chorus singer and for a character role in &quot;Seeta Rama Jananam&quot; by Pratibha Films. After this, he worked with well-known music directors &quot;Gali Penchala&quot; and C. R. Subbaraman. Ghantasala&#x27;s first film as a music director was &quot;Laxmamma&quot;. He introduced the technique of changing the vocal pitch and diction to suit the actor singing the songs. Ghantasala was peerless at Padyam renderings and his way with the Telugu padyam was incomparable.

Producer Chittajallu Krishnaveni gave Ghantasala his first job as full-time music director for her film &quot;Mana Desam&quot;, which was N. T. Rama Rao&#x27;s first film. It established Ghantasala as a music composer-cum-playback singer. He was the most prolific film composer and playback singer in Telugu cinema until the mid-1970s. He composed music for many popular Telugu movies, including &quot;Patala Bhairavi&quot;, &quot;Mayabazar&quot;, &quot;Lava Kusa&quot;, &quot;Pandava Vanavasam&quot;, &quot;Rahasyam&quot;, &quot;Gundamma Katha&quot;, &quot;Paramanandayya Shishyula Katha&quot; and &quot;Pelli Chesi Chudu&quot;, and also for popular Tamil and Kannada films in the 1950s and 1960s. Ghantasala sang for and directed the music for a Hindi film &quot;Jhandaa ooncha Rahe Hamara&quot; (1964). The song &quot;Siva Sankari&quot; from the film &quot;Jagadeka Veeruni Katha&quot; (1961) believed to be one of the most challenging songs from classical Hindusthani and carnatic style was sung by Ghantasala in a single take.


===Private recordings and Bhagavad Gita===
Ghantasala served as the &quot;Aaasthana Gaayaka&quot; (court musician) for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. He recorded private albums, including Bhagawad Gita, Patriotic Songs, Padyalua unique genre of Telugu, singing the verses in dramatic stylePushpa Vilapam, Devotional and folk songs. His recording of &quot;Bhagawad Gita&quot;, which he directed and sang, can now be heard daily in the Tirumala temple. According to music director Pendyala Nageswara Rao and playback singer P. Susheela, &quot;Ghantasala alone is the foremost among playback singers who had a full-fledged melodious powerful voice range which could accommodate in uniformity, all the three octaves in music quite comfortably&quot;.

Pendyala Nageswara Rao channelled Ghantasala&#x27;s classical musical knowledge and skills in classical renditions and in Telugu films including siva sankari from film &quot;Jagadekaveeruni Katha&quot;, Rasika Raja taguvaramu kama from film &quot;Jayabheri&quot;, and Syamala Dandakam – Manikya Veena from film &quot;Mahakavi Kalidasu&quot;. Pendyala said these renditions were recorded only in one take by Ghantasala.

==Death==
Ghantasala died on 11 February 1974, two months after his 51st birthday, due to cardiac arrest at a hospital in Chennai. The last song he recorded was for a documentary – Bhadrachala Ramadasu Vaibhavam (music by Master Venu) from the hospital bed the day before his death.

==Legacy==
The Indian government released a postage stamp and first day cover to celebrate Ghantasala&#x27;s work on 11 February 2003. He is the first movie singer-composer of the south to be accorded this honour. The US Postal Department has released a postal stamp on Ghantasala on 6 October 2014. The postal stamp was jointly released by the North American Telugu Society (NATS) in collaboration with Telugu Literary and Cultural Association (TLCA) in New York.
Various awards named after Ghantasala are given every year, including the &quot;Ghantasala melody king award&quot;. Recipients of this award include playback singers K J Yesudas and P Suseela, and Indian Idol Sri Ramachandra. Ghantasala Arts Academy has instituted the &quot;Ghantasala National Award&quot;; the first winner was playback singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam.

<text>The London Metal Exchange (LME) is a futures and forwards exchange in London, United Kingdom with the world&#x27;s largest market in standardised forward contracts, futures contracts and options on base metals. The exchange also offers contracts on ferrous metals and precious metals. The company also allows for cash trading. It offers hedging, worldwide reference pricing, and the option of physical delivery to settle contracts. 

== Overview ==
===Ring trading===
Trading times are 11:40 to 17:00 GMT.

The LME is the last exchange in Europe where open-outcry trading takes place. The ring was temporarily closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, LME proposed closing the ring, Europe&#x27;s last open-outcry trading floor, and moving permanently to an electronic system. However, the ring reopened in September of the same year after resistance from members.

In addition to the 9 companies that have exclusive rights to trade in the ring, around 100 companies are involved in the LME in total.

===Precious metals===
The LME used, however, to provide trade matching and clearing services to the London bullion market and distributes gold, silver, and gold IRS (interest rate swaps) forward rates on behalf of the LBMA.

===Electronic trading===
The LME launched an electronic platform called LME Select launched in February 2001. This was developed by a Swedish software house Cinnober. The platform is a FIX-based trading platform, and now handles a majority of the total LME business.

===LME Clear===
LME Clear is the clearing house for the London Metal Exchange. Launched in 2014 it was designed and built in consultation with the market to provide cost-efficient, EMIR compliant clearing and settlement services, using cutting-edge technology. LME Clear has announced the appointment of David Warren as Chairman effective July 20, 2023. David will succeed Marco Strimer, who will step down as chairman at the end of his term of office.

==History==
LME can trace its history to metals trading in Royal Exchange, London.

It was purchased by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in 2012.

In March 2022, LME was sued by Elliott Management, an American hedge fund. The hedge fund sued for $456 million, claiming that LME acted &quot;unreasonably and irrationally&quot; when it canceled nickel trades made on March 8, 2022. Jane Street Global Trading also sued LME for $15.3 million over its cancelled nickel trades in March. Both lawsuits were filed in the High Court of Justice. In November 2023, the court ruled in LME&#x27;s favor, with Elliott and Jane Street appealing the decision to the Court of Appeals.

<doc id="223979" wikidata="Q927143" url="?curid=223979" title="Stepfamily">
<text>A stepfamily (sometimes called a bonus family) is a family where at least one parent has children who are not biologically related to their spouse. Either parent, or both, may have children from previous relationships or marriages. Two known classifications for stepfamilies include &quot;simple&quot; stepfamilies, where only one member of the family&#x27;s couple has a prior child or children and the couple does not have any children together, and &quot;complex&quot; or &quot;blended&quot; families, where both members of the couple have at least one child from another relationship.

== Etymology ==
The earliest recorded use of the prefix &quot;step-&quot;, in the form , is from an 8th-century glossary of Latin-Old English words meaning . is given for the Latin word and for . Similar words recorded later in Old English include , , and . The words are used to denote a connection resulting from the remarriage of a widowed parent and are related to the word meaning &#x27;bereaved&#x27;, with and occasionally used simply as synonyms for &quot;orphan&quot;. Words such as &quot;stepbrother&quot;, &quot;stepniece&quot; and &quot;stepparent&quot; appeared much later and have no particular connotation of bereavement. Corresponding words in other Germanic languages include Old High German and Old Norse .

== Terminology ==
A child is referred to as the stepdaughter or stepson of their biological or adoptive parent&#x27;s new spouse, and the spouse is referred to as the stepparent (father or mother) of the child.

A stepparent is the spouse of someone&#x27;s parent, and not their biological parent, stepfather being the male spouse and stepmother the female spouse.

A step-grandparent is the step-parent of someone&#x27;s parent, and not someone&#x27;s biological grandparent, stepgrandfather being the male one, and stepgrandmother the female one.

A step-uncle is the spouse of someone&#x27;s parent&#x27;s sister (aunt) or brother (uncle) and is not the father of someone&#x27;s cousin, except when the sibling marries another and never has children (no cousins). The sister&#x27;s niece/nephew should refer to a new spouse as uncle, not step-uncle. A step-aunt is the spouse of someone&#x27;s parent&#x27;s brother (uncle) or sister (aunt) and is not the mother of someone&#x27;s cousin, except when the sibling marries another and never had children (no cousins). The sister&#x27;s niece or nephew should refer to the newest spouse as aunt, not step-aunt. Similarly, a stepsibling is the offspring of a stepparent to whom one is not biologically or adoptive related, stepbrother being the male one and stepsister the female one. A stepgrandson is the grandson of someone&#x27;s spouse who one is not biologically related to. A step-granddaughter is the granddaughter of someone&#x27;s spouse to whom one is not biologically or adoptive related.

Alternatively, in Australia Under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth), a &quot;stepparent&quot; in relation to a child is interpreted as a person who is not a parent of the child and is, or has been, married to or a de facto partner of a parent of the child, and treats, or at any time while married to or a de facto partner of the parent treated, the child as a member of the family formed with the parent. If one member of the couple has prior children but the couple have another child together, the &quot;complex/blended&quot; designation replaces the &quot;simple&quot; designation upon the birth of the new child. Any subsequent child born to the couple is a half-sibling of the respective members&#x27; prior children.

Other types of stepfamilies include neotraditional, where both parents share the responsibility of their children, a matriarchal stepfamily, where an independent woman is in charge of the family with the stepfather becoming a mentor, and a romantic stepfamily, where both parents expect the combining of their separate families to run smoothly without realizing any possible issues.

== Challenges ==
According to James Bray, three of the challenges facing a stepfamily are financial and living arrangements, resolving feelings about the previous marriage, and anticipating parenting changes. Research has shown that parents who are constantly fighting with their ex-spouse tend to make their children suffer mentally and emotionally. However, parents who are close with their ex-spouse tend to make their new spouse insecure and anxious.

Additional challenges that a step- or blended family face are those regarding the inherent bond that biological parents have with their children and vice versa. Stepparents often face significant difficulties when interacting with the biological parent of their gender. Often, biological parents feel as though the stepfather or stepmother will ultimately replace them in the mind(s) of the child(ren). This is a common feeling for a parent when faced with the new circumstance of blended families.

== Legal status ==

Although historically stepfamilies are built through the institution of marriage and are legally recognized, it is currently unclear if a stepfamily can be both established and recognized by less-formal arrangements, such as when a man or woman with children cohabits with another man or woman outside of marriage. This relationship is becoming more common in all Western countries.

There appear to be many cultures in which these families are recognized socially as de facto families. However, in modern Western culture it is often unclear as to what, if any, social status and protection they enjoy in law.

The stepparent is a &quot;legal stranger&quot; in most of the U.S. and has no legal right to the minor child no matter how involved in the child&#x27;s life they are. The biological parents (and, where applicable, adoptive parents) hold that privilege and responsibility. If the biological parent does not give up their parental rights and custody of the child, the other parent&#x27;s subsequent marriage cannot create a parental relationship without the biological parent&#x27;s written consent before a &quot;child&quot; reaches adulthood. In most cases, the stepparent can not be ordered to pay child support.

Stepparents generally do not have the authority to give legal consent to medical treatment for a stepchild, unless the stepparent has legally adopted the child or been designated a legal guardian. A child&#x27;s parents or legal guardians may sign a statement authorizing a third party to consent to medical care.

If a stepparent legally adopts the partner&#x27;s child or children, he or she becomes the child&#x27;s legal parent. In such cases, the parents may stop using the terms &quot;stepparent&quot; and &quot;stepchild&quot; and instead refer to the child simply as their son or daughter; depending on the child&#x27;s degree of affinity for the adoptive parent and/or approval of the legal proceedings culminating in the child&#x27;s adoption, the child may likewise drop the &quot;step-&quot; designation from his or her description of the relationship. Even when all parties describe the relationship using the terms applied to biological and adoptive families, however, at least some of the emotional and psychological issues common to stepfamilies may or may not persist.
Thus, one possibility is that a stepfamily can be reconfigured, and thanks to the biological and adoptive links could leave the condition of a stepfamily.

== Stepparent adoption ==

=== United States ===
In the world (including the United States), the most common form of adoption is adopting a stepchild. By adopting a stepchild, the stepparent is agreeing to be fully responsible for their spouse&#x27;s child. The non-custodial parent no longer has any rights or responsibilities for the child, including child support.

When a stepparent adopts a stepchild, either the other biological parent willingly gives up their parental rights to the child, the court terminates those rights, or the other biological parent is deceased. Reasons a court may terminate the non-custodial parent&#x27;s rights include evidence of abuse or neglect, legal abandonment, or any other indications that a continued relationship between the child and that parent would be detrimental to the child. Grounds for legal child abandonment in most states is no contact between the parent and child for at least one year.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, one needs to put into writing what the child&#x27;s circumstances are for being adopted. Some circumstances may include: the child&#x27;s mental, physical, and emotional welfare, their background, religion, having a positive relationship, etc. If the child is an indigenous person, then the family must specify their plan to keep the child involved in their culture.

== Abuse ==

A common villain of classic fairy tales is the abusive stepmother, like the queen in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, Lady Tremaine in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, or Madame Fichini in &quot;The Trouble with Sophie&quot;, which shows mother-in-law as cruel. She mistreats her non-biological child by locking them away, or trying to kill them in some cases, and treats her own children, if any, very well. In popular culture, phrases like are uttered as a common threat that show just how aware people are about the assumed nature of stepfamily abuse. The thought is that the nonbiological child is more likely to be beaten because of the lack of kinship ties. The research on this topic shows that this issue is not so clearly defined. The image of the wicked stepmother is well known but much of the research available shows more of the abuse coming from stepfathers.
However, in children&#x27;s stories, it is rare to find a bad father-in-law – yet there are several, such as Charles Francis Mistrane, a bad father-in-law, violent and hateful in the &quot;Eleonore&quot; tale, by R.J.P Toreille, published in France in 2018.

Stepfathers have been shown to abuse female stepchildren more than males. They are also shown to be more abusive towards female children than biological families, but less abusive than adoptive fathers. The abuse studied with men in mind tends to focus on physical or sexual abuse of children rather than emotional abuse. Neglect is also discussed as a qualifying method of child abuse by stepparents in general. In 2004 a U.S. study by Weekes and Weekes-Shackelford found that while biological fathers fatally abuse children five and under at a rate of 5.6 per million per year, stepfathers were found to have a rate of 55.9 per million per year. A U.K. study done in 2000 had different results which found that many fewer children responded as being abused by a stepparent. Economic factors could also play a role in the abuse of stepchildren. In places with higher levels of social strain, abuse may be more prevalent or more violent. Other studies of census data and child neglect and abuse records have found that stepparents may be over-represented in abuse figures. They have found that when the data is balanced, biological parents have a much higher rate of abuse than stepparents do.

There is little research in the field of parental abuse by children in concern with stepchildren abusing stepparents. The abuse of stepchildren by their siblings is also a topic with little research.

== In research ==
In her book, &quot;Becoming a Stepfamily&quot;, Patricia Papernow (1993) suggests that each stepfamily goes through seven distinct stages of development, which can be divided into the early, middle, and late stages. The early stages consist of the fantasy, immersion, and awareness stages. In the fantasy stage, both children and parents are typically &quot;stuck&quot; in their fantasies or wishes for what their family could be like. The developmental task for this stage is for each member to articulate their wants and needs. In the Immersion stage, the family is typically struggling to live out the fantasy of a &quot;perfect&quot; blended family. In this stage, it is critical for the &quot;insider spouse&quot; (i.e. the biological parent who typically forms the emotional hub of the family) to understand that the feelings of the &quot;outsider spouse&quot; and children are real. The task of this stage is to persist in the struggle to become aware of the various experiences. This stage is followed by the awareness stage, in which the family gathers information about what the new family looks like (e.g., roles, traditions, &quot;family culture&quot;) and how each member feels about it. The tasks of this stage are twofold: individual and joint. The individual task is for each member to begin to put words to the feelings they are experiencing, and to voice their needs to other family members. The joint task is for family members to begin to transcend the &quot;experiential gaps&quot; and to try to form an understanding of other members&#x27; roles and experiences.

The middle stages consist of the mobilization and action stages. In the mobilization stage, the stepparent can begin to step forward to address the family&#x27;s process and structure. The tasks of this stage are to confront differences in each member&#x27;s perception of the new family, as well as to influence one another before shaming or blaming begins to take action to reorganize the family structure. The goal here is to make joint decisions about new stepfamily rituals, rules, and roles. The focus in this stage is on the stepfamily&#x27;s unique &quot;middle ground&quot; (i.e. the ), and on balancing this new middle ground with honoring of past and other relationships.

The later stages consist of the contact and resolution stages. In the contact stage, the couple is working well together, the boundaries between households are clear, and stepparents have definite roles with stepchildren as &quot;intimate outsiders.&quot; The task for this stage is in solidifying the stepparent&#x27;s role, and in continuing the process of awareness. Finally, in the resolution stage, the stepfamily&#x27;s identity has become secure. The family accepts itself for who it is, there is a strong sense of the stepfamily&#x27;s middle ground, and children feel secure in both households. The task for this stage is to nourish the depth and maturity gained through this process, and to rework any issues that might arise at family &quot;nodal events&quot; (e.g., weddings, funerals, graduations, etc.).

In her book, &quot;Stepmonster: A New Look at Why Real Stepmothers Think, Feel, and Act the Way We Do&quot;, social researcher Wednesday Martin takes an anthropological approach to examining stepfamily dynamics.

== Education ==
The prevalence of stepfamilies has increased over the past century with the increase of divorce and remarriage. According to the Step Family Foundation, These families are unique in their experiences facing many challenges which first-married families do not. For example, role ambiguity, dealing with stepchildren, and ex-spouses are only a few of the issues which are unique to these families. In response to these families&#x27; desire for assistance, stepfamily education has become an increasingly common topic among scholars and educators. Although still a relatively new facet within the marriage education realm, stepfamily education provides important information which may not be addressed in traditional marriage or relationship education curriculum. As discussed by Adler-Baeder and Higginbotham (2004) a number of curricula are currently available to stepfamilies and family life educators; however, further research is needed in order to determine best practices for the field. One way in which this gap is being filled is through the current implementation of Healthy Marriage Demonstration Grants in the U.S. As part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood, which include at-risk and diverse populations such as stepfamilies, are providing important information on the evaluation of stepfamily programs and their effectiveness in servicing stepfamilies.

<doc id="223980" wikidata="Q1325808" url="?curid=223980" title="Ice crystal">
<text>Ice crystals are solid ice in symmetrical shapes including hexagonal columns, hexagonal plates, and dendritic crystals. Ice crystals are responsible for various atmospheric optical displays and cloud formations.

== Formation ==

 At ambient temperature and pressure, water molecules have a V shape. The two hydrogen atoms bond to the oxygen atom at a 105° angle. Ice crystals have a hexagonal crystal lattice, meaning the water molecules arrange themselves into layered hexagons upon freezing.

Slower crystal growth from colder and drier atmospheres produces more hexagonal symmetry. Depending on environmental temperature and humidity, ice crystals can develop from the initial hexagonal prism into many symmetric shapes. Possible shapes for ice crystals are columns, needles, plates and dendrites. Mixed patterns are also possible. The symmetric shapes are due to depositional growth, which is when ice forms directly from water vapor in the atmosphere. Small spaces in atmospheric particles can also collect water, freeze, and form ice crystals. This is known as nucleation. Snowflakes form when additional vapor freezes onto an existing ice crystal.
=== Trigonal and cubic crystals ===
Supercooled water refers to water below its freezing point that is still liquid. Ice crystals formed from supercooled water have stacking defects in their layered hexagons. This causes ice crystals to display trigonal or cubic symmetry depending on the temperature. Trigonal or cubic crystals form in the upper atmosphere where supercooling occurs.

=== Square crystals ===
Water can pass through laminated sheets of graphene oxide unlike smaller molecules such as helium. When squeezed between two layers of graphene, water forms square ice crystals at room temperature. Researchers believe high pressure and the van der Waals force, an attractive force present between all molecules, drives the formation. The material is a new crystalline phase of ice.
== Weather phenomena ==

Ice crystals create optical phenomena like diamond dust and halos in the sky due to light reflecting off of the crystals in a process called scattering.

Cirrus clouds and ice fog are made of ice crystals. Cirrus clouds are often the sign of an approaching warm front, where warm and moist air rises and freezes into ice crystals. Ice crystals rubbing against each other also produces lightning. The crystals normally fall horizontally, but electric fields can cause them to clump together and fall in other directions.

== Detection ==
The aerospace industry is working to design a radar that can detect ice crystal environments to discern hazardous flight conditions. Ice crystals can melt when they touch the surface of warm aircraft, and refreeze due to environmental conditions. The accumulation of ice around the engine damages the aircraft. Weather forecasting uses differential reflectivity weather radars to identify types of precipitation by comparing a droplet&#x27;s horizontal and vertical lengths. Ice crystals are larger in the horizontal direction and are thus detectable.

<doc id="223983" wikidata="Q179367" url="?curid=223983" title="European roller">
<text>The European roller (Coracias garrulus) is the only member of the roller family breeding in Europe. Its range extends into the Maghreb, West Asia and Central Asia. It winters in southern Africa, primarily in dry wooded savanna and bushy plains. It occurs in a wide variety of habitats, but avoids treeless plains. It usually nests in tree holes.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The European roller was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current the binomial name &quot;Coracias garrulus&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. The generic name derives from Greek &quot;korakias&quot; referring to a type of corvid, perhaps the red-billed chough. The specific epithet &quot;garrulus&quot; is from Latin and means &#x27;chattering&#x27; in reference to the bird’s calls. Alternate English names include the blue roller, common roller, Eurasian roller, or simply roller.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018 found that the European roller was most closely related to the Abyssinian roller (&quot;Coracias abyssinicus&quot;).

The rollers are medium-sized Old World birds of open woodland habitats. They have brightly coloured plumage and a hooked bill. Most species are found south of the Sahara. The genus &quot;Coracias&quot; contains eight species of sit-and-wait hunters. The European roller is similar in appearance and behaviour to the Abyssinian roller. These two birds and the lilac-breasted roller have been considered to form subspecies.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* Western European roller (&quot;C. g. garrulus&quot;) : The nominate subspecies. Found in north-western Africa, southern Europe and east through north-western Iran to south-western Siberia.
* Eastern European roller (&quot;C. g. semenowi&quot;) : It is also called Kashmir roller and lives in Iraq and southern Iran east through Kashmir and southern Kazakhstan to Xinjiang in western China.

==Description==


The European roller is a stocky bird, the size of a Eurasian jay at in length with a wingspan. It is mainly blue with an orange-brown back.

The European roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blue contrasting with black flight feathers. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult.
The display of this bird is like that of a lapwing, with the twists and turns that give this species its English name.
The call is a harsh crow-like sound. It gives a raucous series of calls when nervous.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European roller is a bird of warmer regions. The nominate subspecies breeds in northern Africa from Morocco to Tunisia, in southern and east-central Europe, and eastwards through northwestern Iran to southwestern Siberia. The subspecies &quot;C. g. semenowi&quot; breeds from Iraq and southern Iran east through Kashmir and southern Kazakhstan to Xinjiang. The European range was formerly more extensive, but there has been a long-term decline in the north and west, with extinction as a nesting bird in Sweden and Germany. The European roller is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa south of the Sahara in two distinct regions, from Senegal east to Cameroon and from Ethiopia west (with observations in the Degua Tembien mountains) to Congo and south to South Africa. Some populations migrate to Africa through India. A collision with an aircraft over the Arabian Sea has been recorded.
It is a bird of warm, dry, open country with scattered trees, preferring lowlands, but occurs up to in Europe and in Morocco. Oak and pine woodlands with open areas are prime breeding habitat, but farms, orchards and similar areas with mixed vegetation are also used. In Africa, a similarly wide range of dry, open land with trees is used. It winters primarily in dry, wooded savanna and bushy plains, where it typically nests in tree holes.

==Migration==
The advent of sufficiently lightweight tracking technology has facilitated several recent studies of roller migration, providing new information on the non-breeding sites used by European rollers from different breeding populations. Individuals from south-west European populations migrate to Angola, Namibia and Botswana; French and north Spanish birds take a direct southerly route across the Sahara, while Portuguese and south Spanish birds take a more westerly route around the west African coast. European rollers from eastern European populations also spend the winter period in southern Africa, but further east in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Some population migrate through western India during August to November. The Sahel savannah region immediately south of the Sahara Desert, particularly the area around Lake Chad, appears to be important for European rollers from many populations as an autumn re-fuelling site, and Latvian and other north and north-eastern populations migrate northwards via the Arabian Peninsula in spring. Individuals from different breeding populations use distinct but overlapping winter sites; there is a correlation between the longitude of individual breeding and non-breeding sites, suggesting parallel migration. In the east, the northernmost breeders from Latvia tend to winter south of the southernmost breeders from Cyprus, indicating a pattern of &#x27;leap-frog&#x27; migration.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The European roller chick will vomit a foul-smelling orange liquid onto itself to deter a predator. The smell also warns the parents on their return to the nest.

===Food and feeding===
Rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts or overhead wires, like giant shrikes, whilst watching for the large insects, small reptiles, rodents and frogs that they eat. The diet of adult rollers is dominated by beetles, whereas nestlings mostly eat Orthoptera, such as grasshoppers and bush crickets.

===Breeding===

The nest site is usually in a natural cavity in a tree or in a hole excavated by a woodpecker. It is typically located above the ground. Pairs sometimes use a cavity in rocks or buildings and may occasionally excavate a hole in a sandy bank. The hole is unlined. The clutch is 2 to 6 white smooth glossy eggs that measure . They are laid at intervals of two or occasionally three days. They are incubated by both sexes but mainly by the female starting before the clutch is completed. They hatch after 17 to 19 days. The young are cared for by both parents but usually the male passes food to the female. The nestlings fledge after 26 to 27 days. Only a single brood is raised each year, but a replacement clutch is laid if the first is lost. European rollers generally first breed when they are two years old.

The maximum age recorded from ring-recovery data is 9 years and 2 months for a bird shot in Poland.

===Diseases ===
The European roller is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Moniliformis gracilis&quot;.

==Conservation status==
The Eurasian roller has an extensive distribution in Europe and western Asia, and its European breeding population is estimated at 159,000 to 330,000 birds. When Asian breeders are added, this gives a global total population of 277,000 to 660,000 individuals. There have been fairly rapid population declines across much of its range, so it was formerly classified as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2005; it has, however, been downlisted to least concern in 2015, as population development was judged to not meet the criteria for a more urgent rating at this time. The European population declined by 25% between 1990 and 2000. The northern areas of the breeding range have fared worst, with numbers in the Baltic states and northern Russia collapsing, and no birds left breeding in Estonia.

Threats include hunting while on migration around the Mediterranean, and large numbers, possibly in the thousands, are killed for food in Oman. Agricultural practices have led to the loss of trees and hedges which provide potential nest sites and perches for hunting, and pesticides have reduced the availability of insect food. At locations where foraging resources are abundant, providing nest boxes can be a useful short-term conservation solution; however, in other locations foraging habitat restoration is more important.

<text>In organic chemistry, the cycloalkanes (also called naphthenes, but distinct from naphthalene) are the monocyclic saturated hydrocarbons. In other words, a cycloalkane consists only of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a structure containing a single ring (possibly with side chains), and all of the carbon-carbon bonds are single. The larger cycloalkanes, with more than 20 carbon atoms are typically called cycloparaffins. All cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes.

The cycloalkanes without side chains (also known as monocycloalkanes) are classified as small (cyclopropane and cyclobutane), common (cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane), medium (cyclooctane through cyclotridecane), and large (all the rest). 

Besides this standard definition by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), in some authors&#x27; usage the term &quot;cycloalkane&quot; includes also those saturated hydrocarbons that are polycyclic.
In any case, the general form of the chemical formula for cycloalkanes is C&quot;n&quot;H2(&quot;n&quot;+1−&quot;r&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of carbon atoms and &quot;r&quot; is the number of rings. The simpler form for cycloalkanes with only one ring is C&quot;n&quot;H2&quot;n&quot;.

== Nomenclature ==


Unsubstituted cycloalkanes that contain a single ring in their molecular structure are typically named by adding the prefix &quot;cyclo&quot; to the name of the corresponding linear alkane with the same number of carbon atoms in its chain as the cycloalkane has in its ring. For example, the name of cyclopropane (C3H6) containing a three-membered ring is derived from propane (C3H8) - an alkane having three carbon atoms in the main chain. 

The naming of polycyclic alkanes such as bicyclic alkanes and spiro alkanes is more complex, with the base name indicating the number of carbons in the ring system, a prefix indicating the number of rings ( &quot;&quot;bicyclo&quot;-&quot; or &quot;&quot;spiro&quot;-&quot;), and a numeric prefix before that indicating the number of carbons in each part of each ring, exclusive of junctions. For instance, a bicyclooctane that consists of a six-membered ring and a four-membered ring, which share two adjacent carbon atoms that form a shared edge, is [4.2.0]-bicyclooctane. That part of the six-membered ring, exclusive of the shared edge has 4 carbons. That part of the four-membered ring, exclusive of the shared edge, has 2 carbons. The edge itself, exclusive of the two vertices that define it, has 0 carbons.

There is more than one convention (method or nomenclature) for the naming of compounds, which can be confusing for those who are just learning, and inconvenient for those who are well-rehearsed in the older ways. For beginners, it is best to learn IUPAC nomenclature from a source that is up to date, because this system is constantly being revised. In the above example [4.2.0]-bicyclooctane would be written bicyclo[4.2.0]octane to fit the conventions for IUPAC naming. It then has room for an additional numerical prefix if there is the need to include details of other attachments to the molecule such as chlorine or a methyl group. Another convention for the naming of compounds is the &quot;common name&quot;, which is a shorter name and it gives less information about the compound. An example of a common name is terpineol, the name of which can tell us only that it is an alcohol (because the suffix &quot;-ol&quot; is in the name) and it should then have a hydroxyl group (–OH) attached to it.

The IUPAC naming system for organic compounds can be demonstrated using the example provided in the adjacent image. The base name of the compound, indicating the total number of carbons in both rings (including the shared edge), is listed first. For instance, &quot;heptane&quot; denotes &quot;hepta-&quot;, which refers to the seven carbons, and &quot;-ane&quot;, indicating single bonding between carbons. Next, the numerical prefix is added in front of the base name, representing the number of carbons in each ring (excluding the shared carbons) and the number of carbons present in the bridge between the rings. In this example, there are two rings with two carbons each and a single bridge with one carbon, excluding the carbons shared by both the rings. The prefix consists of three numbers that are arranged in descending order, separated by dots: [2.2.1]. Before the numerical prefix is another prefix indicating the number of rings (e.g., &quot;bicyclo+&quot;). Thus, the name is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

Cycloalkanes as a group are also known as naphthenes, a term mainly used in the petroleum industry.

== Properties ==
Containing only C–C and C–H bonds, cycloalkanes are similar to alkanes in their general properties. Cycloalkanes with high angle strain, such as cyclopropane, have weaker C–C bonds, promoting ring-opening reactions.

Cycloalkanes have higher boiling points, melting points, and densities than alkanes. This is due to stronger London forces because the ring shape allows for a larger area of contact.

Even-numbered cycloalkanes tend to have higher melting points than odd-numbered cycloalkanes. While variations in enthalpy and orientational entropy of the solid-phase crystal structure largely explain the odd-even alternation found in alkane melting points, conformational entropy of the solid and liquid phases has a large impact on cycloalkane melting points. For example, cycloundecane has a large number of accessible conformers near room temperature, giving it a low melting point, whereas cyclododecane adopts a single lowest-energy conformation (up to chirality) in both the liquid phase and solid phase (above 199 K), and has a high melting point. These trends are broken from cyclopentadecane onwards, due to increasing variation in solid-phase conformational mobility, though higher cycloalkanes continue to display large odd-even fluctuations in their plastic crystal transition temperatures. Sharp plastic crystal phase transitions disappear from onwards, and sufficiently high molecular weight cycloalkanes, such as , have similar crystal lattices and melting points to high-density polyethylene.

== Conformations and ring strain ==

In cycloalkanes, the carbon atoms are &quot;sp&quot;3 hybridized, which would imply an ideal tetrahedral bond angle of 109° 28 whenever possible. Owing to evident geometrical reasons, rings with 3, 4, and (to a small extent) also 5 atoms can only afford narrower angles; the consequent deviation from the ideal tetrahedral bond angles causes an increase in potential energy and an overall destabilizing effect. Eclipsing of hydrogen atoms is an important destabilizing effect, as well. The strain energy of a cycloalkane is the increase in energy caused by the compound&#x27;s geometry, and is calculated by comparing the experimental standard enthalpy change of combustion of the cycloalkane with the value calculated using average bond energies. Molecular mechanics calculations are well suited to identify the many conformations occurring particularly in medium rings.

Ring strain is highest for cyclopropane, in which the carbon atoms form a triangle and therefore have C–C–C bond angles. There are also three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens. The ring strain is calculated to be around 120 kJ mol−1.

Cyclobutane has the carbon atoms in a puckered square with approximately 90° bond angles; &quot;puckering&quot; reduces the eclipsing interactions between hydrogen atoms. Its ring strain is therefore slightly less, at around 110 kJ mol−1.

For a theoretical planar cyclopentane the C–C–C bond angles would be 108°, very close to the measure of the tetrahedral angle. Actual cyclopentane molecules are puckered, but this changes only the bond angles slightly so that angle strain is relatively small. The eclipsing interactions are also reduced, leaving a ring strain of about 25 kJ mol−1.

In cyclohexane the ring strain and eclipsing interactions are negligible because the puckering of the ring allows ideal tetrahedral bond angles to be achieved. In the most stable &quot;chair form&quot; of cyclohexane, axial hydrogens on adjacent carbon atoms are pointed in opposite directions, virtually eliminating eclipsing strain. 
In medium-sized rings (7 to 13 carbon atoms) conformations in which the angle strain is minimised create transannular strain or Pitzer strain. At these ring sizes, one or more of these sources of strain must be present, resulting in an increase in strain energy, which peaks at 9 carbons (around 50 kJ mol−1). After that, strain energy slowly decreases until 12 carbon atoms, where it drops significantly; at 14, another significant drop occurs and the strain is on a level comparable with 10 kJ mol−1. At larger ring sizes there is little or no strain since there are many accessible conformations corresponding to a diamond lattice.

Ring strain can be considerably higher in bicyclic systems. For example, bicyclobutane, C4H6, is noted for being one of the most strained compounds that is isolatable on a large scale; its strain energy is estimated at 267 kJ mol−1.

== Reactions ==
Cycloalkanes, referred to as naphthenes, are a major substrate for the catalytic reforming process. In the presence of a catalyst and at temperatures of about 495 to 525 °C, naphthenes undergo dehydrogenation to give aromatic derivatives:

The process provides a way to produce high octane gasoline.

In another major industrial process, cyclohexanol is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane in air, typically using cobalt catalysts:
:2 C6H12 + O2 → 2 C6H11OH
This process coforms cyclohexanone, and this mixture (&quot;KA oil&quot; for ketone-alcohol oil) is the main feedstock for the production of adipic acid, used to make nylon.

The small cycloalkanes – in particular, cyclopropane – have a lower stability due to Baeyer strain and ring strain. They react similarly to alkenes, though they do not react in electrophilic addition, but in nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. These reactions are ring-opening reactions or ring-cleavage reactions of alkyl cycloalkanes.

== Preparation ==
Many simple cycloalkanes are obtained from petroleum. They can be produced by hydrogenation of unsaturated, even aromatic precursors. 

Numerous methods exist for preparing cycloalkanes by ring-closing reactions of difunctional precursors. For example, diesters are cyclized in the Dieckmann condensation:
The acyloin condensation can be deployed similarly. 

For larger rings (macrocyclizations) more elaborate methods are required since intramolecular ring closure competes with intermolecular reactions.

The Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition, provides a route to cyclohexenes:
The corresponding [2+2] cycloaddition reactions, which usually require photochemical activation, result in cyclobutanes.

<text>An orchidometer (or orchiometer) is a medical instrument used to measure the volume of the testicles.

==Instrument==

The orchidometer was introduced in 1966 by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader of the University of Zurich. It consists of a string of twelve numbered wooden or plastic beads of increasing size from about 1 to 25 millilitres. Doctors sometimes informally refer to them as &quot;Prader&#x27;s balls&quot;, &quot;the medical worry beads&quot;, or the &quot;endocrine rosary&quot;.

The beads are compared with the testicles of the patient, and the volume is read off the bead which matches most closely in size. Prepubertal sizes are 1–3 ml, pubertal sizes are considered 4 ml and up and adult sizes are 15-25 ml.

The orchidometer can be used to accurately determine size of testes. Discrepancy of testicular size with other parameters of maturation can be an important clue to various diseases. Small testes can indicate either primary or secondary hypogonadism. Testicular size can help distinguish between different types of precocious puberty. Since testicular growth is typically the first physical sign of true puberty, one of the most common uses is as confirmation that puberty is beginning in a boy with delayed puberty. Large testes (macroorchidism) can be a clue to one of the most common causes of inherited generalised learning disability, fragile X syndrome.

Stephen Shalet, a leading endocrinologist who works for the Christie Hospital in Manchester, is reported to have told &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;Every endocrinologist should have an orchidometer. It&#x27;s his stethoscope.&quot;

Orchidometers are also commonly used to measure testicular volume of rams.

==Related concept==
Numerous clinical scales and measurement systems exist to define genitals as normal male or female, or &quot;abnormal&quot;, including the Prader scale, Quigley scale, and the satirical Phall-O-Meter.

<doc id="223992" wikidata="Q1027878" url="?curid=223992" title="Wind shear">
<text>Wind shear (; also written windshear), sometimes referred to as wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere. Atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear. Vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with a change in altitude. Horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with a change in lateral position for a given altitude.

Wind shear is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance, but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts. It is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms, fronts, areas of locally higher low-level winds referred to as low-level jets, near mountains, radiation inversions that occur due to clear skies and calm winds, buildings, wind turbines, and sailboats. Wind shear has significant effects on the control of an aircraft, and it has been the only or a contributing cause of many aircraft accidents.

Sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into longer life cycles which can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed at different heights are dependent on horizontal temperature differences and explains the existence of the jet stream.
==Definition==
Wind shear refers to the variation of wind velocity over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of for light aircraft, and near for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low-level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during takeoff and landing in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of ). The rationale for this additional caution includes:
*microburst intensity can double in a minute or less,
*the winds can shift to excessive crosswinds,
* is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and
*several of the historical wind shear accidents involved microbursts.
Wind shear is also a key factor in the formation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.

==Occurrence==
Weather situations where shear is observed include:
*Weather fronts. Significant shear is observed when the temperature difference across the front is or more, and the front moves at or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and can therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above warm fronts is more of an aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.
*Upper-level jet streams. Associated with upper-level jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient at the edge of the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.
*Low-level jet streams. When a nocturnal low-level jet forms overnight above Earth&#x27;s surface ahead of a cold front, significant low-level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low-level jet. This is also known as non-convective wind shear as it is not due to nearby thunderstorms.
*Mountains.
*Inversions. When on a clear and calm night, a radiation inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above the top of the inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90 degrees in direction and in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low-level jet can sometimes be observed. It tends to be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.
*Downbursts. When an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind shear can result at the leading edge of the three-dimensional boundary. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become.

==Horizontal component==

===Weather fronts===

Weather fronts are boundaries between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones in the wind field and are the principal cause of significant weather. Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries. Cold fronts feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather and may be preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line that separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move from east to west across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along the local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.

===Near coastlines===

The magnitude of winds offshore is nearly double the wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between landmasses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.

==Vertical component==

===Thermal wind===

Thermal wind is a meteorological term not referring to an actual wind, but a &quot;difference&quot; in the geostrophic wind between two pressure levels and , with ; in essence, wind shear. It is only present in an atmosphere with horizontal changes in temperature (or in an ocean with horizontal gradients of density), i.e., baroclinicity. In a barotropic atmosphere, where temperature is uniform, the geostrophic wind is independent of height. The name stems from the fact that this wind flows around areas of low (and high) temperature in the same manner as the geostrophic wind flows around areas of low (and high) pressure.

The &quot;thermal wind equation&quot; is

:formula_1

where the are geopotential height fields with , is the Coriolis parameter, and is the upward-pointing unit vector in the vertical direction. The thermal wind equation does not determine the wind in the tropics. Since is small or zero, such as near the equator, the equation reduces to stating that is small.

This equation basically describes the existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is (even though other factors are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.

=== Effects on tropical cyclones ===
Tropical cyclones are, in essence, heat engines that are fueled by the temperature gradient between the warm tropical ocean surface and the colder upper atmosphere. Tropical cyclone development requires relatively low values of vertical wind shear so that their warm core can remain above their surface circulation center, thereby promoting intensification. Strongly sheared tropical cyclones weaken as the upper circulation is blown away from the low-level center.

===Effects on thunderstorms and severe weather===

Severe thunderstorms, which can spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to organize the storm in such a way as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period. This occurs as the storm&#x27;s inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low-level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and causes the thunderstorm to dissipate.

===Planetary boundary layer===
The atmospheric effect of surface friction with winds aloft forces surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise near the surface of Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure) when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above Earth&#x27;s surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft and are most emphasized at night.

====Effects on flight====
=====Gliding=====

In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of the flight of a glider.
Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.

When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.

Wind shear is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.

=====Parachuting=====
Wind shear or wind gradients are a threat to parachutists, particularly to BASE jumping and wingsuit flying. Skydivers have been pushed off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed, and have collided with bridges, cliffsides, trees, other skydivers, the ground, and other obstacles. Skydivers routinely make adjustments to the position of their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion.

=====Soaring=====
Soaring related to wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a technique used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.

Wind shear can also produce wave. This occurs when an atmospheric inversion separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction. If the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by thermals coming up from below, it will produce significant shear waves that can be used for soaring.

=====Impact on passenger aircraft=====

Windshear can be extremely dangerous for aircraft, especially during takeoff and landing. Sudden changes in wind velocity can cause rapid decreases in airspeed, leading to the aircraft being unable to maintain altitude. Windshear has been responsible for several deadly accidents, including Eastern Air Lines Flight 66, Pan Am Flight 759, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, and USAir Flight 1016.

Windshear can be detected using Doppler radar. Airports can be fitted with low-level windshear alert systems or Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, and aircraft can be fitted with airborne wind shear detection and alert systems. Following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have airborne wind shear detection and alert systems by 1993. The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by windshear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.

====Sailing====
Wind shear affects sailboats in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low-level wind shear can be factored into the selection of sail twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low-level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.

====Sound propagation====

Wind shear can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere, where waves can be &quot;bent&quot; by refraction phenomenon. The audibility of sounds from distant sources, such as thunder or gunshots, is very dependent on the amount of shear. The result of these differing sound levels is key in noise pollution considerations, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and must be considered in the design of noise barriers. This phenomenon was first applied to the field of noise pollution study in the 1960s, contributing to the design of urban highways as well as noise barriers.

The speed of sound varies with temperature. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, producing an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. In 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.

====Effects on architecture====
Wind engineering is a field of engineering devoted to the analysis of wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics, and several specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels, and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.

Wind turbines are affected by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel, and this, in turn, affects the turbine operation. This low-level wind shear can cause a large bending moment in the shaft of a two-bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.

<doc id="223993" wikidata="Q1362362" url="?curid=223993" title="Wake (physics)">
<text>In fluid dynamics, a wake may either be:
* the region of recirculating flow immediately behind a moving or stationary blunt body, caused by viscosity, which may be accompanied by flow separation and turbulence, or
* the wave pattern on the water surface downstream of an object in a flow, or produced by a moving object (e.g. a ship), caused by density differences of the fluids above and below the free surface and gravity (or surface tension).

==Viscosity==

The wake is the region of disturbed flow (often turbulent) downstream of a solid body moving through a fluid, caused by the flow of the fluid around the body.

For a blunt body in subsonic external flow, for example the Apollo or Orion capsules during descent and landing, the wake is massively separated and behind the body is a reverse flow region where the flow is moving toward the body. This phenomenon is often observed in wind tunnel testing of aircraft, and is especially important when parachute systems are involved, because unless the parachute lines extend the canopy beyond the reverse flow region, the chute can fail to inflate and thus collapse. Parachutes deployed into wakes suffer dynamic pressure deficits which reduce their expected drag forces. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations are often undertaken to model wake flows, although such modeling has uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling (for example RANS versus LES implementations), in addition to unsteady flow effects. Example applications include rocket stage separation and aircraft store separation.

==Density differences==
In incompressible fluids (liquids) such as water, a bow wake is created when a watercraft moves through the medium; as the medium cannot be compressed, it must be displaced instead, resulting in a wave. As with all wave forms, it spreads outward from the source until its energy is overcome or lost, usually by friction or dispersion.

The non-dimensional parameter of interest is the Froude number.

===Kelvin wake pattern===
==Other effects==
The above describes an ideal wake, where the body&#x27;s means of propulsion has no other effect on the water. In practice the wave pattern between the V-shaped wavefronts is usually mixed with the effects of propeller backwash and eddying behind the boat&#x27;s (usually square-ended) stern.

The Kelvin angle is also derived for the case of deep water in which the fluid is not flowing in different speed or directions as a function of depth (&quot;shear&quot;). In cases where the water (or fluid) has shear, the results may be more complicated. Also, the deep water model neglects surface tension, which implies that the wave source is large compared to capillary length.

==Recreation==
&quot;No wake zones&quot; may prohibit wakes in marinas, near moorings and within some distance of shore in order to facilitate recreation by other boats and reduce the damage wakes cause. Powered narrowboats on British canals are not permitted to create a breaking wash (a wake large enough to create a breaking wave) along the banks, as this erodes them. This rule normally restricts these vessels to or less.

Wakes are occasionally used recreationally. Swimmers, people riding personal watercraft, and aquatic mammals such as dolphins can ride the leading edge of a wake. In the sport of wakeboarding the wake is used as a jump. The wake is also used to propel a surfer in the sport of wakesurfing. In the sport of water polo, the ball carrier can swim while advancing the ball, propelled ahead with the wake created by alternating armstrokes in crawl stroke, a technique known as dribbling. Furthermore, in the sport of canoe marathon, competitors use the wake of fellow kayaks in order to save energy and gain an advantage, through the practice of sitting their boats on the wake of another, so their kayak is propelled by the wash.

<doc id="223995" wikidata="Q583264" url="?curid=223995" title="David Holmgren">
<text>David Holmgren (born 1955) is an Australian environmental designer, ecological educator and writer. He is best known as one of the co-originators of the permaculture concept with Bill Mollison.

==Early life== 
Holmgren was born in Fremantle, Western Australia in February 1955, the second of three children. His parents Venie and Jack Holmgren were bookshop proprietors, activists committed to social justice, and former members of the communist party who raised their children to question authority and stand up for their beliefs.

Holmgren was dux of John Curtin High School, but this remained unrecorded on the roll of honour due to his ‘dissident attitude’. On completing high school he hitchhiked around Australia, before moving to Tasmania in 1974 to study at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education&#x27;s Department of Environmental Design. In the alternative education environment there he chose to study landscape design, ecology and agriculture.

== Permaculture ==
Holmgren first met Bill Mollison in 1974 when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design. This led to an intense working relationship over the next three years, with Holmgren and Mollison sharing a house and garden, putting ideas into practice and collecting useful plant species. Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become &quot;Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements&quot; as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978.

Holmgren&#x27;s development of permaculture ideas and practices were also strongly influenced by Haikai Tane, as well as the work of P. A. Yeomans, Franklin Hiram King, Howard T. Odum and Albert Howard.

Holmgren initially concentrated his efforts on testing and refining his theories, first on his mother&#x27;s property in southern New South Wales (&quot;Permaculture in the Bush&quot;, 1985; 1993), then at his own property, &quot;Melliodora, Hepburn Permaculture Gardens&quot;, at Hepburn Springs, Victoria, which he developed with his partner, Su Dennett.

He started his consultancy business Holmgren Design Services in 1983, designing and advising on a wide range of projects including:
*Commonground Co-operative, Seymour Vic 
*Project Branchout 
*CERES Community Environment Park, Brunswick, Vic 
*‘Millpost Farm’, Bungendore NSW David Watson Millpost: A broad acre permaculture farm since 1979 
*‘Energy descent action and planning in the Hepburn Shire ’ report for Hepburn Shire, exploring innovation in sustainability and resilience planning at the local level

The publication in December 2002 of Holmgren&#x27;s major work on permaculture saw a deeper and more accessible systematisation of the principles of permaculture refined by Holmgren over more than 25 years of practice. The book, &quot;Permaculture: Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability&quot; (2002a), is dedicated to Howard T. Odum, who died two months before its publication, and it owes much to Odum&#x27;s vision of a world in energy transition.

&quot;Principles and Pathways&quot; offers twelve key permaculture design principles, each explained in separate chapters. It is regarded as a major landmark in permaculture literature, especially as the seminal work, Bill Mollison&#x27;s &quot;Permaculture: A Designer&#x27;s Manual&quot; (1988) was published fifteen years previously and has never been revised.

== Other contributions ==
=== Novel ecosystems ===
Holmgren is a public critic of the land management orthodoxy of removing all non-native plants despite their ecological functions.
Holmgren&#x27;s interest in recombinant ecosystems or &#x27;weedscapes&#x27; is partly inspired by a 1979 visit to New Zealand and interactions with New Zealand ecologist Haikai Tane (1995). It has also been shaped by Holmgren&#x27;s interactions and experimentation at Spring Creek Community Forest where an informal network of locals manage a riparian forest of mixed native and non native species, with outcomes including increased recreational use and reduced fire hazard. The site has hosted guided tours and has been the subject of scientific research.

His ‘Weeds or wild nature: a permaculture perspective’ (2011) was published in Plant Protection Quarterly, and he wrote the foreword to Tao Orion&#x27;s Beyond the War on Invasive Species.

=== Future scenarios ===
In 2007 Adam Grubb, founding editor of Energy Bulletin.net (now Resilience.org) published Holmgren&#x27;s extended essay &quot;Future Scenarios; mapping the cultural implications of Peak Oil and Climate Change&quot; at futurescenarios.org, which established Holmgren as a significant futurist articulating and clarifying the Energy Descent concept.

Influenced by the work of Nicole Foss, Holmgren&#x27;s more recent work has also taken into account the possible impacts of a global financial bubble burst.

=== Retrofitting the suburbs ===
Holmgren argues that Australian suburbs can be effectively retrofitted for liveability, resilience and sustainability through strategies such as home food production and preservation, building retrofits and behaviour change. An early version of these ideas, &#x27;Retrofitting the Suburbs for Sustainability&#x27;, was published by the CSIRO in 2005

Holmgren created the fictional story &#x27;Aussie St&#x27; to illustrate both the changes in Australian suburbs since the 1950s, and a possible resilient future.

His work on retrofitting the suburbs culminated in 2018 with the publication of &quot;RetroSuburbia: the downshifter&#x27;s guide to a resilient future&quot;. The work is both a manifesto and a manual on how Australian suburbs can be transformed to become productive and resilient in an energy decent future. It is divided into three fields for action – the Built, the Biological and the Behavioral – and contains real-life case studies and an update of the Aussie St story.

== Major projects ==
=== Melliodora ===

Holmgren&#x27;s home and major development site since 1986, “Melliodora” is a -acre property situated at the edge of Hepburn Springs, central Victoria. It is one of the best-documented and well-known permaculture demonstration sites in the world. The passive solar house, mixed food gardens and orchards, dams and livestock, and creek revegetation in the nearby public land show how permaculture design can help restore and improve land, and provide for residents&#x27; needs and enjoyment in a cool continental inland climate.

=== Fryers Forest Ecovillage ===

Fryers Forest Ecovillage, near Castlemaine, in Central Victoria, Australia is a significant design and test of his permaculture principles.

==Recognition==
Recognition for Holmgren&#x27;s contribution as an environmental designer, educator and activist has been slow to develop after the initial enthusiasm generated by the publication of &quot;Permaculture One&quot; when he was 23. The inclusion in &quot;Ecological Pioneers&quot; (of Australia) was the first substantial recognition by academic authors. The inclusion of a three part series on Melliodora in a best of ten years of &quot;Gardening Australia&quot;, the most popular Australian TV gardening program, and a person profile on the Australian broadcast network program &quot;Landline&quot; (ABC TV rural program) have been the most significant recognition by mainstream media. In 2012, following the publication of &quot;PP&amp;PBS&quot; in Italian, the environmental organisation Fondazione Parchi Monumentali Bardini e Peyron recognised Holmgren&#x27;s contribution with the award Il Monito del Giardin.

In 2014, Holmgren was inducted into the Green Lifestyle Awards Hall of Fame for his pioneering and ongoing work with permaculture since he co-founded the concept more than three decades ago. He is in the good company of Bob Brown, the inaugural inductee in 2012 and Olivia Newton-John in 2013.

In 2017 Holmgren was awarded an honorary doctorate from CQUniversity.

==Publications==

Although &quot;Permaculture One&quot; was published by a mainstream publisher (Corgi) most of Holmgren&#x27;s work has been self-published allowing experimentation with subject material such as case studies (&quot;Permaculture in bush&quot;, &quot;Trees on the treeless planes&quot; and &quot;Melliodora&quot;), book formats (&quot;Melliodora&quot; A3 landscape) and eBook formats (&quot;Melliodora&quot;, &quot;Collected Writings&quot;) before their more widespread uptake, and Web publishing (&quot;Future Scenarios&quot;). This DIY approach reflects permaculture principles that encourage experimentation and self-reliance.

&quot;The Essence of Permaculture&quot;, a summary of &quot;PP&amp;PBS&quot;, is the most translated work by Holmgren (available in 10 languages in 2015) while &quot;PP&amp;PBS&quot; is available in Spanish, Portuguese , Italian, Czech, Japanese, French, Korean and Chinese . &quot;Future Scenarios&quot; is available in Japanese.

<text>A virga, also called a dry storm, is an observable streak or shaft of precipitation that evaporates or sublimates before reaching the ground. A shaft of precipitation that does not evaporate before reaching the ground is known in meteorology as a precipitation shaft. At high altitudes, precipitation falls mainly as ice crystals before melting and finally evaporating. That is often due to compressional heating, because air pressure increases closer to the ground. Virga is very common in deserts and temperate climates. In North America, it is commonly seen in the Western United States and the Canadian Prairies. It is also very common in the Middle East, Australia, and North Africa.

Virgae can cause varying weather effects because as rain is changed from liquid to vapor form it removes significant amounts of heat from the air due to water&#x27;s high heat of vaporization. Precipitation falling into these cooling downdrafts may eventually reach the ground. In some instances these pockets of colder air can descend rapidly, creating a wet or dry microburst which can be extremely hazardous to aviation. Conversely, precipitation evaporating at high altitude can compressionally heat as it falls, and result in a gusty downburst which may substantially and rapidly warm the surface temperature. This fairly rare phenomenon, a heat burst, also tends to be of exceedingly dry air.

Virgae also have a role in seeding storm cells. That is because small particles from one cloud are blown into neighboring supersaturated air and act as nucleation particles for the next thunderhead cloud to begin forming.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Latin &quot;virga&quot;, meaning rod, sprig, staff, branch, shoot, twig, spray, sprout, switch or graft.

==Elsewhere in the solar system ==
Sulfuric acid rain in the atmosphere of Venus evaporates before reaching the ground due to the high heat near the surface. Similarly, virgae happen on gas giant planets such as Jupiter. In September 2008, NASA&#x27;s Phoenix lander discovered a snow variety of virga falling from Martian clouds.

<text>Balitoridae, the hillstream loaches or river loaches, is a family, of small fish from South, Southeast and East Asia. The family includes about 202 species. They are sometimes sold as &quot;lizardfish&quot; or (in Germany) &quot;flossensaugers&quot;. Many of the species are popular for aquaria, species in the genus &quot;Sewellia&quot; are most commonly sold in the aquaria trade. They have a number of similarities with the Cobitidae, their sibling family of &quot;loaches&quot;, such as multiple barbels around the mouth. They should not be confused with the loricariids, which look similar but are a family of catfish.

Most species are rheophilic, living in swift, clear and well-oxygenated streams. Several species of the family live in fast-flowing streams or torrents and have modified ventral fins used for clinging to rocks.

The subfamily Nemacheilinae has recently been separated as a distinct family, Nemacheilidae (stone loaches) and several genera have been separated into the family Gastromyzontidae.

==Genera==
Balitoridae contains the following genera:

<doc id="224011" wikidata="Q5532414" url="?curid=224011" title="Generalised logistic function">
<text>The generalized logistic function or curve is an extension of the logistic or sigmoid functions. Originally developed for growth modelling, it allows for more flexible S-shaped curves. The function is sometimes named Richards&#x27;s curve after F.J.Richards, who proposed the general form for the family of models in 1959.

==Definition==
Richards&#x27;s curve has the following form:
:formula_1
where formula_2 = weight, height, size etc., and formula_3 = time. It has six parameters:
*formula_4: the left horizontal asymptote;
*formula_5: the right horizontal asymptote when formula_6. If formula_7 and formula_6 then formula_5 is called the carrying capacity;
*formula_10: the growth rate;
*formula_11 : affects near which asymptote maximum growth occurs.
*formula_12: is related to the value formula_13
*formula_14: typically takes a value of 1. Otherwise, the upper asymptote is formula_15

The equation can also be written:

:formula_16

where formula_17 can be thought of as a starting time, at which formula_18. Including both formula_12 and formula_17 can be convenient:

:formula_21

this representation simplifies the setting of both a starting time and the value of formula_2 at that time.

The logistic function, with maximum growth rate at time formula_17, is the case where formula_24.

==Generalised logistic differential equation==
A particular case of the generalised logistic function is:

:formula_25

which is the solution of the Richards&#x27;s differential equation (RDE):

:formula_26

with initial condition

:formula_27

where

:formula_28

provided that formula_11 and formula_30

The classical logistic differential equation is a particular case of the above equation, with formula_31, whereas the Gompertz curve can be recovered in the limit formula_32 provided that:

:formula_33

In fact, for small formula_34 it is

:formula_35

The RDE models many growth phenomena, arising in fields such as oncology and epidemiology.

== Gradient of generalized logistic function ==
When estimating parameters from data, it is often necessary to compute the partial derivatives of the logistic function with respect to parameters at a given data point formula_3 (see). For the case where formula_37, 
:formula_38
==Special cases==
The following functions are specific cases of Richards&#x27;s curves:
* Logistic function
* Gompertz curve
* Von Bertalanffy function
* Monomolecular curve

<doc id="224012" wikidata="Q777000" url="?curid=224012" title="Appeal to consequences">
<text>Appeal to consequences, also known as argumentum ad consequentiam (Latin for &quot;argument to the consequence&quot;), is an argument that concludes a hypothesis (typically a belief) to be either true or false based on whether the premise leads to desirable or undesirable consequences. This is based on an appeal to emotion and is a type of informal fallacy, since the desirability of a premise&#x27;s consequence does not make the premise true. Moreover, in categorizing consequences as either desirable or undesirable, such arguments inherently contain subjective points of view.

In logic, appeal to consequences refers only to arguments that assert a conclusion&#x27;s truth value (&quot;true or false&quot;) without regard to the formal preservation of the truth from the premises; appeal to consequences does not refer to arguments that address a premise&#x27;s consequential desirability (&quot;good or bad&quot;, or &quot;right or wrong&quot;) instead of its truth value. Therefore, an argument based on appeal to consequences is valid in long-term decision making (which discusses possibilities that do not exist yet in the present) and abstract ethics, and in fact such arguments are the cornerstones of many moral theories, particularly related to consequentialism. Appeal to consequences also should not be confused with &quot;argumentum ad baculum&quot;, which is the bringing up of &#x27;artificial&#x27; consequences (i.e. punishments) to argue that an action is wrong.

== General form ==
An argument based on &quot;appeal to consequences&quot; generally has one of two forms:

=== Positive form ===
:If P, then Q will occur.
:Q is desirable.
:Therefore, P is true.

It is closely related to wishful thinking in its construction.

* &quot;Real estate markets will continue to rise this year: home owners enjoy the capital gains.&quot;
* &quot;Humans will travel faster than light: faster-than-light travel would be beneficial for space travel.&quot;

=== Negative form ===
:If P, then Q will occur.
:Q is undesirable.
:Therefore, P is false.

Appeal to force (&quot;argumentum ad baculum&quot;) is a special instance of this form.

This form somewhat resembles &quot;modus tollens&quot; but is both different and fallacious, since &quot;Q is undesirable&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;Q is false&quot;.

;Example
&quot;If the six men win, it will mean that the police are guilty of perjury, that they are guilty of violence and threats, that the confessions were invented and improperly admitted in evidence and the convictions were erroneous... This is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land would say that it cannot be right that these actions should go any further.&quot; Lord Denning in his judgment on the Birmingham Six.

== In law ==

In law, an argument from inconvenience or &quot;argumentum ab inconvenienti&quot;, is a valid type of appeal to consequences. Such an argument would seek to show that a proposed action would have unreasonably inconvenient consequences, as for example a law that would require a person wishing to lend money against a security to first ascertain the borrower&#x27;s title to the property by inquiring in every single courthouse in the country.

<text>Colima, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Colima, is among the 31 states that make up the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It shares its name with its capital and main city, Colima.

Colima is a small state of western Mexico on the central Pacific coast, and includes the four oceanic Revillagigedo Islands. Mainland Colima shares borders with the states of Jalisco and Michoacán. In addition to the capital city of Colima, the main cities are Manzanillo, Villa de Alvarez and Tecomán. Colima is the fourth smallest state in Mexico and has the smallest population, but has one of Mexico&#x27;s highest standards of living and the lowest unemployment. It is also the state with the highest murder rate per capita and one of the highest crime rates, due to its ports being a contested area for cartels.

==Geography==

The state covers a territory of 5,455 km2 and is the fourth smallest federal entity after Tlaxcala, Morelos and the Federal District of Mexico City, containing only 0.3% of the country&#x27;s total territory. The state is in the middle of Mexico&#x27;s Pacific coast, bordered by the Pacific Ocean and the states of Jalisco and Michoacán.

Colima&#x27;s territory includes the Revillagigedo Islands—Socorro, San Benedicto, Clarión, and Roca Partida. These are under federal jurisdiction but are considered part of the municipality of Manzanillo.

Politically, the state is divided into ten municipalities. Natural geography divides the state into a northern and southern region. The north has a cooler climate due to the higher mountains. The south is hotter and includes the Pacific Ocean coastline. The Revillagigedo Islands, of volcanic origin, are dispersed along the 19° north parallel over an area of about 400 km2—with a total landmass of 205 km2.

The altitude varies from sea level to 3,839 m (12,595 ft) at the crater of the Volcán de Colima.

The state is in an offshoot of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range and geographically consists of four mountain systems. The most important of these is the Cerro Grande and its related peaks of Jurípicho-Juluapan, Los Juanillos, La Astilla, El Ocote, El Peón, El Barrigón, San Diego, and La Media Luna. The second consists of mountain chains parallel to the coast between the Marabasco and Armería Rivers, which include El Espinazo del Diablo, El Escorpión, El Tigre, El Aguacate, El Centinela, El Tora and La Vaca. The third is located between the Armería and Salado Rivers and includes the Alcomún y Partida, San Miguel y Comala and San Gabriel/Callejones peaks. The last is between the Salado and Naranjo or Coahuayana Rivers and contains small mountain chains such as the Piscila, Volcancillos, La Palmera, El Camichín and Copales. Three quarters of the state is covered by mountains and hills.

At the very north of the state, the border is marked by two volcanoes. The Colima Volcano, also called the Volcán de Fuego, is active and the Nevado de Colima is not. The Nevado de Colima is taller at 4,271 m (14,013 ft) and gives its name to the national park that surrounds it. The Colima Volcano, 3825 m (12,549 ft), has a pyramidal peak, in contrast to the other, which has been leveled somewhat. The last major eruptions of the Colima Volcano occurred in 1998 and 1999.

The main rivers of the state are the Cihuatlán River, also called the Chacala, Marabasco, or Paticajo, which forms the state&#x27;s border with Jalisco on the west; the Armería, which descends from the Sierra de Cacoma and crosses the state north–south into the Pacific, and the Coahuayana River, which forms Colima&#x27;s eastern border with Michoacán. The Salado is another important river, which flows entirely within Colima before emptying into the Coahuayana. Many of the state&#x27;s streams and arroyos empty into the Salado.

Colima has a relatively short coastline, at 139 km (1.2% of Mexico&#x27;s total). It extends from the Boca de Apiza to the Cerro de San Francisco in front of Barra de Navidad, Jalisco.

Coastal lagoons include the Potrero Grande in Manzanillo along with the Miramar and the San Pedrito. On the Tecomán municipality coast there are the lagoons of Alcuzahua and Amela, with the Cuyutlán lagoon split between the municipalities of Armería and Manzanillo. Inland, there are various fresh water lakes, with the larger ones near the coast and smaller ones in the Valley of Colima. The valley lakes are fed by the runoff from the Colima Volcano and include the Carrizalillo, Las Cuatas, El Jabalí, El Calaboso, La María and La Escondida.

The predominant climate is hot and relatively moist, with the coast particularly moist. One exception is the Tecomán municipality where the climate is dry and very hot. The mildest climates are in the municipalities of Comala and Cuauhtémoc. On the coast, the average temperature varies from between 24 and 26 °C and inland, at the highest elevations, the temperature averages between 20 and 22 °C.

Cropland covers 27% of the state&#x27;s territory, with another 28% dedicated to pasture. Forest covers 35% with the rest composed of bodies of water and urban areas. Most wild vegetation in the west of the state consists of moderately deciduous rainforest of medium height. Plants that lose leaves do so in the dry season. These include commercially important trees such as red cedar, (&quot;Couratara guianensis&quot;), (&quot;Enterolobium cyclocarpum&quot;)—and trees locally known as , and . From the west of Manzanillo and into the municipalities of Armería and Coquimatlán, there is rainforest of medium height with tree species such as (&quot;Bursera&quot;) and (&quot;Parmentiera aculeatea&quot;), with some pines, oaks, and salt friendly mangrove forests and scrub.

There is great diversity of wildlife species although a number of mammal species, such as ocelots, pumas, wild boar and deer, are disappearing. Among the state&#x27;s rodents is the Magdalena rat (&quot;Xenomys nelsoni&quot;), a small rare animal little known outside Colima. Bird species include wild turkeys, although these have mostly disappeared, and a bird called the chachalaca. A number of ducks and other migratory birds pass through. Reptiles include crocodiles, with a nursery in Tecomán dedicated to their survival. It is also one of three Mexican states where the tarantula species &quot;Brachypelma hamorii&quot; is found, the other two being Michoacán and Jalisco.

==Demographics==

In the latter part of the 20th century, Colima had a very high population growth, expanding from 112,321 in 1950 to 567,996 in 2005. This growth was slowed by family planning programs. Despite this population growth, the state still ranks last of Mexico&#x27;s federal entities, with a total of 650,555 according to the 2010 census, only 0.6% of the country&#x27;s total. By 1980, the majority of the state&#x27;s population was living in urban centers. Today, 89% live in urban areas, above the national average of 78%. These urban populations are concentrated in the municipalities of Colima, Manzanillo, Tecomán and Villa de Alvarez.

The majority of the population is mestizo (mixed indigenous and Spanish). As of 2005, some 2,880 people were counted with the ability to speak an indigenous language. This is about 7 out of 1,000 people, slightly higher than the nation&#x27;s average of 6 per 1,000 people. There are ethnic Nahua and Otomi communities in Zacualpan and Suchitlán in the municipality of Comala, in Juluapan and Pueblo Nuevo in the municipality of Villa de Alvarez and in Las Pesadas in the municipality of Minatitlán. According to the 2020 Census, 1.86% of Colima&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent. Over 95% of the state&#x27;s population is Catholic with small communities of other Christian groups making up the rest.

==Principal communities==
The city of Colima is the capital and gives the state its name. It is located in the north central part of the state, just south of the foothills of the Colima Volcano in the Valley of Colima. The city began as a Spanish settlement that was originally established further south in 1523 but moved to the current location in 1527. The capital remains the state&#x27;s economic, political and cultural center.

Villa de Álvarez is part of the city of Colima&#x27;s metropolitan area. It maintains a distinct identity, with a combination bullfighting and charreada event that is one of the oldest of its kind in northwestern Mexico, which takes part in La Petatera, a bullring that is assembled each year for the event, made of logs and petates, and that is known as one of the world&#x27;s largest crafts. It is also known for late evening meals called cenadurias that typically feature sopes, enchiladas, tostadas, pozole, atole, and tamales.

The city of Los Martínez began at the end of the 18th century, established by someone known only by his last name of Martínez. In 1818, a strong earthquake sent many from nearby San Francisco to the area, and it was renamed San Francisco de Almoloyan. It was recognized as a town in 1860, with the name of Villa de Álvarez in honor of the first governor of the state. It was designated a city in 1991.

Manzanillo is the state&#x27;s primary port and tourist destination. It is on the Pacific coast, less than two hours&#x27; drive from the capital. Manzanillo is mostly popular with regional tourists and sports fishermen, but there have been efforts to broaden its appeal. The city is one of Mexico&#x27;s important Pacific ports, handing regional merchandise and acting as an overflow port for other ports from Mexico to Los Angeles. Most of the state&#x27;s recent economic development has been related to this port.

Coquimatlán comes from a Nahuatl phrase meaning &quot;land of networks&quot; referring to the interconnected ravines in the area. It was founded in the very early colonial period and still maintains its narrow streets and old houses with large main doors of wood and balconies with simple ironwork.
Tecomán is located in what has been an agricultural valley since the colonial era, today best known for its production of limes. The town is marked by an abstract sculpture depicting a lime tree created by sculptor Sebastián, which measures thirty meters in height and weighs 110 tons. In addition to being the main lime producer, the Tecoman Valley also produces cocoa, cotton, coconuts, mangos, papaya, avocados and melons.

==Economy==

The state has a high level of socioeconomic development, with one of the highest standards of living in Mexico and lowest unemployment. In the state, 96% have running water, 82% have sewerage and 98% have electricity. The 2009 GDP of the state was 43,370,725,000 pesos. Due to its small size and population, this is only 0.5% of Mexico&#x27;s total GDP. Most population and employment growth has been in the main urban areas of the state such as Colima, Villa de Alvarez, Manzanillo and Tecomán. According to INEGI (2010), 24.1% are employed in services. 20.4% in commerce, restaurants and hotels, 15.9% in transportation, storage and communications, 11.1% in finance, insurance and real estate, 9.5% in electricity, gas and water services, 5.7% in manufacturing, 5.1% in construction, 4.9% in agriculture and livestock and 3.8% in mining.

Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 1.2% of the state&#x27;s population and contribute 8.45% to its GDP. Colima produces about half of Mexico&#x27;s lime crop, and is second in the production of coconut meat and tuna . The principal markets for Colima&#x27;s agricultural products—especially produce—are Guadalajara, Mexico City, Puebla and Monterrey. During the dry season, there is migration from the rural areas into the urban ones as most agricultural work takes place during the rainy season. Most farm work consists of the harvesting of fruit. The agricultural production supports an agro-industry that attracts workers from neighboring Jalisco and Michoacán. Most of Colima&#x27;s agriculture is based on perennial plants, such as fruit trees, producing limes, coconuts, mangos and bananas, accounting for ninety percent of the volume of agricultural production and 79% of its value. Colima is the primary producer of limes in Mexico. Other important crops include corn, rice, melons, sorghum, chili peppers, coffee, tomatoes and tomatillos.

By volume the most important livestock is that of cattle, followed by domestic fowl, then honey and beeswax. Most livestock production is in the north of the state due to climate, and also includes pigs, goats and sheep. Commercially productive forest stands at about 108,225 hectares with about sixty percent of the trees salable. These forests are mostly rainforest, with some areas of holm oak. Lumber harvesting has decreased in the state owing to conservation measures.

Fishing is concentrated on the coastline in ocean waters of about 641 km2 as well as in 8,350 hectares of lagoons and 2,032 inland bodies of waters. There are also about 3,000 hectares dedicated to fish farming. Fish production has increased considerably since the 1980s. This is mostly due to more intensive ocean activities, but fish production from rivers and lakes has also grown, at about twelve percent.

Principal catches include tuna and squid, in which Colima ranks nationally at third and fourth place respectively. Other commercial species include huachinangos, red porgy, combers, wahoo, and mojarra. Fish farming mostly concerns raising shrimp along lakes and lagoons, such as Cuyutlán, Chupadero, and Potrero Grande, with an annual production of about 5,000 tons. Some oyster raising takes place as well.

The fishing industry in the state supports a canning industry mostly for tuna, shrimp and octopus along with the freezing of fish filets.

Mining, construction, and utilities employ 18.5% of the population and generate 27.53% of the GDP. Half of this is from production of electricity, gas, and water services. Mining is next in importance, with production of iron, mostly from the Peña Colorada, the largest deposit in the country. Manufacturing contributes 4.7% of the state&#x27;s GDP with 2,007 units of production. Most facilities produce beverages, metal structures, canned foods, cereals, furniture, printed materials, building supplies and dairy products.

Handcrafts in the state are mostly produced for local needs rather than the tourist market. One distinguished craft is the making of palm frond hats, including a local style called the &quot;colimote&quot;. Ixtlahuacán is noted for its production of hammocks. Other items include huarache sandals, boots, bird cages, cold cuts and costumes and masks for traditional dance. These costumes include &quot;Indian&quot; dresses decorated with cross stitch. The state is also known for the production of handcrafted furniture, especially those based on the designs of Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo, from Comala. Villa de Álvarez produces decorative objects in fine wood. Suchitlán in the municipality of Comala is distinguished by its production of masks and other accessories for festivals and ceremonies. Villages on the sides of the Cerro Grande are the principal producers of baskets made from reeds and palm fronds. Santiago in the municipality of Manzanillo is noted for crafts made of seashell and snail shells. The main craft in the city of Colima is the reproduction of archeological pieces, especially ceramics of the old red-burnished (rojo-bruñido) style.

About two thirds of the state&#x27;s GDP is from commerce and services which include transportation and storage, mostly linked with the Manzanillo port. Economic growth associated with the port continues to grow by double digits. Most commercial activity in general is concentrated in the cities of Colima, Tecomán and Manzanillo, which have the most developed communications, transportation and other infrastructure. The main distribution center is the city of Colima handing both basic commodities and industrial and other commercial merchandise for the rest of the state. Just under 95% of Colima&#x27;s commercial enterprises are retail outlets with 5.6% involved in wholesale. Only three percent of these enterprises are modern facilities with twenty-one traditional markets, forty-five major tianguis and numerous corner stores still dominating the state. Commercial sales increase by about five percent per year.

Much of the state&#x27;s tourism centers on its beaches in Manzanillo, and in the municipalities of Armería and Tecomán. Manzanillo is the most popular in the state, and a major tourism destination for Mexico&#x27;s Pacific coast. For this reason, it has developed infrastructure with hotels, restaurants, golf courses, and other attractions. For Holy Week 2011, one of Mexico&#x27;s busiest vacation times, the state gained 175 million pesos and had a hotel occupancy of 94%, 7% higher than the previous year. 70,249 visited during that period. Most of the visitors were at the state&#x27;s beaches with the busiest being Cuyutlán, El Real and Miramar.

==Tourist attractions==
Colima&#x27;s most important tourism destination is the beaches of Manzanillo, which is popular among those in western Mexico as well as many sports fishermen. Historically, the port was the point of departure for various maritime expeditions and received the annual Manila Galleon from the Philippines. It has called itself the &quot;World Capital of the Sailfish&quot; since 1957 when 336 species were caught off its shores. The abundance of this fish along with marlin has made it a popular destination with sports fishermen and the city holds the annual Dorsey International fishing tournament. It is not as well known or as visited as other Pacific destinations such as Puerto Vallarta, despite long sandy beaches and docks for cruise ships. In the 2000s, the city worked to renovate its downtown, with all buildings now showing white facades and many with red tile roofs.

The second most important destination is the small town of Comala, a small traditional town near the capital of Colima. Comala was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; in 2002 because of its natural surroundings and traditional architecture, which its downtown declared a historic monument. Since 1962, all the buildings in the town have been painted white and most have red tile roofs, giving it the nickname of &quot;White Village of America.&quot;

Most of the other attractions of the state are related to its history, and most of these are in and around the capital city of Colima. The former state government palace is located in the center of the city of Colima and dates from the 19th century. The main stairwell contains a mural by Colima painter Jorge Chávez Carrillo. The Palacio Federal is near Jardín Núñez in the city of Colima and dates from the beginning of the 20th century. The upper floor contains murals with scenes depicting Mexico City and portraits of people from Mexico&#x27;s history. The Archive of the History of the State is located at Jardín Juárez in the city of Colima. It dates from the early 20th century and was home to the Escuela de Artes . San Francisco de Almoloyan in the city of Colima is the ruins of an old Franciscan monastery from the 16th century. The Mesón de Caxitlán on the Colima Tecomán highway is the ruins of an old in on the former royal road from the 18th century.

Other important attractions include a number of former haciendas, many of which have been renovated. The Del Carmen hacienda is in the municipality of Villa de Álvarez. It was a cattle ranch from the 19th century, and has been restored. The San Antonio hacienda is in the municipality of Comala. It was a coffee plantation from the 19th century, with a chapel and aqueduct, which have all been restored. The former Nogueras hacienda in Comala has a main house that dates from the 19th century and a chapel from the 17th. It has been restored and is used primarily as a museum.

The United States Department of State considers the State of Colima so dangerous due to widespread crime that it has issued a &quot;Do Not Travel&quot; advisory to its citizens for the entire state.

==Culture==

Indigenous, and Spanish cultures have played a part in the shaping of the state, although traces can be hidden in modern local cultures and traditions. Most crafts and dances of the state are of indigenous origin although some originated after the Conquest. The Spanish contributed to bullfighting and charreada.

The most popular folk dances in the state include some that tell the story of the Spanish conquest—under various names, such as &quot;Conquista,&quot; &quot;Virgin of Guadalupe,&quot; &quot;capotes,&quot; and &quot;the fox.&quot; Another popular dance is called &quot;Apaches.&quot; These originated in the colonial period, along with &quot;Moros y Cristianos&quot; and &quot;machines.&quot; Dances with indigenous roots include &quot;sonajera India&quot; and &quot;morenos.&quot;

Pastorales, or short plays with religious themes, are traditions that began in the very early colonial period. A popular one from that time is the &quot;Adoration of the Three Wise Men,&quot; though it has evolved to meet modern tastes.

Colima has a number of important local festivals and other annual events. January 6 is the &quot;Los Chayacates de Ixtlahuacán&quot;—a mix of indigenous and Catholic practices based on the pastorale and the cultivation cycle of corn. On the Tuesday after Epiphany is the &quot;Entrance of the Señor de la Expiración&quot; in Rancho de Villa. On this date, the image returns to this village from Coquimatlán. It includes parades, dances, fireworks, and jaripeos.
Candlemas is an important event in Tecomán with traditional dances and fairs. Candlemas in Suchitlán is the most important annual event in the region, celebrated with dances such as Los Gallitos, Los Apaches and Los Morenos. The last two dances involved dancers with elaborately carved and decorated masks.

Villa de Álvarez celebrates its annual Fiestas Charro-Taurinas, originally the feast of the city&#x27;s patron saint, Philip of Jesus. In addition to bullfights and charreadas, mojigangas are featured. The Paspaques of Suchitlán—an agricultural ritual of pre-Hispanic origin—is celebrated by the Nahuas of this small village on March 19. It centers on preparing corn in various ways, such as tortillas, tamales, pozole, and more. Holy Week is a major event in many municipalities, which often hold passion plays during the week.

The Feria de Manzanillo occurs from April 29 to May 1 and celebrates the anniversary of its designation as a major port (Puerto de Altura). It is held with street parties, dances, contests, and jaripeos. May 3 is the Day of the Holy Cross, important in Suchitlán, and celebrated with the &quot;morenos&quot; dance. The Fiestas del Cristo de Caña in Quesería in May revolves around an 18th-century Christ image that came to the area from Pátzcuaro. It is celebrated with horse races, mojigangas, traditional dance, processions, and music. On September 29 Tamala, the municipality of Ixtlahuacán celebrates the feast of the Archangel Michael with a change of &quot;mayordomos&quot; (festival sponsors).

The most important festival in the state is Day of the Dead. For the weeks before and after, the state holds its Agricultural, Industrial, and Cultural Fair. On November 1, the city of Colima has an agricultural, livestock, commerce, and industry fair that includes dances, parades with floats and a charreada. Pastorelas are most commonly seen during December between the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe (December 12) and Christmas. Comala celebrates the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from the first to the December 12 with processions, bullfights, jaripeos, cockfights—and on the eighth with a dance to popular music, floats, and fireworks.

The state has produced one internationally famous artist named Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo. He is best known for illustrating Christmas cards for UNICEF in the 1960s, but he did much other work and designed furniture in a style now called Rangeliano. Many of his works are preserved at his former home of the Nogueras Hacienda in Comala, which is now a museum and cultural center run by the University of Colima. Other noted artists from the state include Gabriel Portillo, Mercedes Zamora, Jorge Chávez Carrillo, Pancha Magaña and Juan Soriano. Noted writers include Gregorio Torres Quintero, Fray Juan de Grijalva, Balbino Dávalos and Felipe Sevilla.

==Communications and transportation==
===Transport===

The most important transportation hub in the state is the port of Manzanillo, handling 91.3% of the shipping of the state and the immediate region. It also operates as an overflow port for the commercial and industrial zones of western Mexico, the Bajío area and the center of Mexico, but handles overflow from as far as Los Angeles. Most of the merchandise that passes through here is part of the trade between Mexico and Asia. The port infrastructure consists of two types of installations. One is artificial, located in the interior port of San Pedrito and the other located in the bay proper. The artificial structure is a tall dock with a length of 450 meters and 225 meters wide for a surface of 10,125m2. The Manzanillo port has a dock for cruise ships, and an average of 58 ships visit per year. Nearby are two large private marinas, one in Las Hadas and the other at Isla Navidad. The port area is not fully developed, with over 130 hectares reserved for expansion.

The two main airports are the Playa de Oro International Airport in Manzanillo and the Lic. Miguel de la Madrid Airport in Colima. Playa de Oro has flights to and from destinations in Mexico, the United States and Canada. The Miguel de la Madrid airport was opened in 1987, twenty-two km outside the capital. It extends over 386 hectares with runways that cover 16,200m2. The longest runway is 2.3 km long. It has one terminal. Most of the Colima airport flights go to Mexico City, with about 100,000 passengers going through the terminal in 2009.

The state has 1,424.5 km of roadway with 686.9 km paved with asphalt and the rest stone or dirt road. The main highway out of the state connects the city of Colima and Guadalajara. The second most important connects Manzanillo with Guadalajara. This roadway has broken Mexican records in the dimensions of its bridges. There are 191.5 km of railway with fifteen active stations.

===Media===
There are eight AM radio stations operating in the state and five FM stations. Most are in Colima and Manzanillo. There is no local television station with programming coming from Mexico City and through cable. Telephone service covers the entire state but rural areas still use analog. There are still some telegraph centers. The state has fourteen newspapers mostly in the city of Colima and Manzanillo, including: &quot;Correo de Manzanillo&quot;, &quot;Diario de Colima&quot;, and &quot;Ecos de la Costa.&quot;

==History==

===Name and seal===
The formal name of the state is &quot;Estado Libre y Soberano de Colima&quot; (Free and Sovereign State of Colima). The state is named after the capital city of Colima. This name is most likely derived from a Nahuatl phrase &quot;coliman&quot;, but the original meaning is in doubt with two most accepted versions. One interpretation means &quot;place in the hand of the grandfather&quot; with &quot;grandfather&quot; possibly referring to the volcano. The other interpretation is &quot;place in the hands of the ancestors&quot;. A third interpretation is based on an interpretation of Colima&#x27;s glyph as it appears in the Nomina and Mendocino codices, which has a bent arm with the hand turned and water on the shoulder. This glyph is still used in the state&#x27;s seal. This interpretation would then be &quot;place where the waters bend&quot;.

===Pre-Hispanic period===

The state was home to a number of pre-Hispanic cultures as part of Western Mexico. Archeological evidence dates human occupation of the area as far back as 1500 BCE, with sites here contemporary with San Lorenzo on the Gulf Coast and Tlatilco in the Valley of Mexico. One period of the area&#x27;s development is called the Los Ortices era, which began around 500 BCE. During this time the elements that characterize the pre-Hispanic peoples of Colima appear, including shaft tombs and a distinctive ceramic style called &quot;rojo bruñido,&quot; or burnished red.

The next phase, called Comala and centered on a site of the same name, was from around 100 to 600 CE. Comala people perfected burnished red pottery and created representations of people and animals with skill and fluid lines. The best known of these figures are known as the &quot;fattened dogs&quot;. The Comala site shows influence from Teotihuacan. Around 500 CE, another site in Armería developed along the river of the same name.

The Chanal site was active from the 6th to the 15th centuries and was the main culture for the Colima area. Belonging to this culture was a number of smaller sites and most of the ones known and explored to date. After Chanal the largest related site is La Campana but most contain pyramidal bases and plazas with structures often containing rounded edges. Images of Huehueteotl and Tlaloc appear with this culture, which may indicate the origins of the cultures that ultimately settled central Mexico.

There is one other site called Periquillo, which indicates one late migration into Colimas around the 10th century from the north.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the Purépechas invaded the territory of the Tecos and got as far as the salt fields of Tzacoalco. A chief named Colimotl or Colliman defeated the P&#x27;urhépechas during the Saltpeter War (1480-1510) (Guerra del Salitre). After this, the Tecos conquered Sayula, Zapotlán and Amunla, making them the dominant cultural group in this part of the state. Both the Periquillo and Chanal sites were occupied when the Spanish arrived in the 16th century.

===Colonial era===
After conquering the Aztecs and the Purépecha, the Spanish made incursions into Colima. The first incursion into the Colima area occurred under Juan Rodríguez de Villafuerte in 1522 but was defeated by the natives of the Tecomán Valley. Hernán Cortés then sent Gonzalo de Sandoval to defeat the Tecos, which he did at the Paso de Alima and the Palenque de Tecomán. Sandoval then established the first Spanish settlement in the Colima Valley called Caxitlán in 1523, making it the third oldest functioning city government in Mexico and the second municipality of western New Spain. In 1527, Francisco Cortés de San Buenaventura moved the Spanish settlement to its current located and changing the name to San Sebastián de Colima.

Revillagigedo Archipelago was brought to colonial attention in 1533 by Hernando de Grijalva. The state&#x27;s first port at Tzalahua would be an important site for about 300 years of Spanish colonial rule as a line of defense and a commercial center.

After the Conquest, the native population was reduced drastically. Some estimations state that the population declines from 150,000 in 1523 to 15,000 in 1554, rebounding somewhat in the 17th century. This population reduction led to the introduction of African slaves and indigenous people from neighboring regions.

Evangelization was carried out by the Franciscans who established the San Francisco de Coliman monastery in 1554 then the Almoloyan monastery. They would be followed by the Mercedarians and the Brothers of Saint John of the Cross. It was originally made part of the diocese of Valladolid (Morelia).

The port of Manzanillo, then called Santiago de Buena Esperanza, played a large part in the expeditions northwards ordered by Hernán Cortés, which later led to the European discovery of &quot;Las Californias&quot; — the Baja California Peninsula and Alta California. Cortés de San Buenaventura set out to conquer towards the north, covering the rest of the state and into what is now southern Sinaloa. Later the port would be a target for pirates as the Manila galleons would unload materials from the Spanish East Indies here. These pirates would include Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish. The last major battle against pirates at Manzanillo was in 1615 with Captain Sebastián Vizcaino defending the port against Dutch pirate Joris van Speilbergen.

Colima lost territory during the colonial period to 1822, and further into the 19th century. With the creation of Nueva Galicia in 1531, it lost its territories north of the Cihuatlán or Marabasco River and the region south of Lake Chapala. In 1550, Colima lost the provinces of Autlán and Amula. By the end of the 16th century, it lost the Motines region, now part of Michoacán and in the 19th century the Xilotlán region to Jalisco.

From the early colonial period, Colima was a province that answered to Mexico City. In 1789, the parish of Colima was incorporated into the diocese of Guadalajara. In 1796, Colima was converted into a sub delegation of the province of Guadalajara.

One colonial area industry in Colima was the production of &quot;coconut wine&quot; — an alcoholic beverage distilled from date palm fruit and coconut. One of the first introduced crops was cacao in the 16th century, with coconut, sugar cane, and cotton coming after. Other crops such as rice, indigo and vanilla would be introduced later.

===Independence to the present===
In the early 19th century, the commercial port of Manzanillo was opened to domestic and international traffic for a brief time. The first Colima newspaper called &quot;El Observador de las Leyes&quot; was published at this time as well.

With the outbreak of the Mexican War of Independence, authorities arrested the head of Indian communities along with suspected insurgents in October 1810. This was despite the fact that Nahua groups had organized to defend against the insurgents upon hearing that they were enemies of the king and planned to destroy churches. One accused insurgent was José Antonio Díaz, the parish priest of Almoloyán and friend of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Later he would join the insurgent army. During the war, the city of Colima was taken by the insurgents Jose Antonio Torres at the end of 1810 without resistance and taken back by the royalist army in 1811. In 1811, royalist troops defeated the insurgents under José Calixto Martinez at the Battle of Los Llanos de Santa Juana. Insurgents took back the city in 1812 under the command of Ignacio Sandoval and Miguel Gallaga. In 1813, the city was in royalist hands with the city swearing allegiance to the monarchist constitution. In 1821 the Plan of Iguala for Mexican independence was proclaimed in the city, and accepted by local authorities. Immediately after Independence, Colima was still a subdelegation of Guadalajara. In 1821, Colima lost the Zapotlán areas along with the towns of Tecalitlán and Xilotlán, but gained the town of Tonila. This and earlier losses of territory would define the area&#x27;s modern borders.

In 1824, with Mexico&#x27;s first constitution, Colima was an independent territory. It integrated with Michoacán in 1837. In 1846, it became a separate territory again, and in 1856, was made a state with the triumph of the Liberals. Its status as a state was reaffirmed by the 1857 Mexican Constitution and General Manuel Alvarez was declared its first constitutional governor.

Colima served as a provisional seat for Benito Juárez&#x27;s Liberal government in 1858 during the Reform War. In 1861, the Revillagigedo Islands were added to Colima&#x27;s territory. French troops entered the city in 1864, dissolving the state congress, with Colima becoming a department in 1865. In 1867, Republican troops under Ramon Corona retook the city. Colima became a diocese independent of Guadalajara in 1881.

The latter part of the 19th century saw the introduction of industry with textile factories such as La Armonía, La Atrevida and San Cayetano. The telegraph arrived to the state in 1869 to connect the capital and the port of Manzanillo. Similarly, the telephone service was added in 1883. Railroad service between the two cities began in 1889 and a city tram was added to the capital in 1892.

During the Mexican Revolution, there were no major battles but there were local clashes. In 1911, troops loyal to Francisco I. Madero entered Colima and suspended the state congress. After the war, social organizations that would mark Mexico&#x27;s development for much of the 20th century were created in Colima as well, especially ejidos, with the one in Suchitlán being the first. Another important movement was the creation of workers&#x27; unions and cooperatives such as the Unión de Estibadores in Manzanillo. In 1919, President Venustiano Carranza created the Sociedad Cooperativa de Salineros in the city of Colima with the exclusive rights to extract salt from Cuyutlán Lake. These changes were imposed by federal authorities outside of Colima, leading to political instability within the state, especially during elections.

Federal intervention from Mexico City continued into the 1920s, with a number of laws to reform schools, hospitals and other institutions, which before had been mostly operated by the Catholic Church. This was opposed by many in the state who supported the Church&#x27;s formerly prominent role in political and social affairs. The Ley de Cultos (Religion Law) of 1926 gave rise to the Cristero War pitting those favoring the Catholic Church against those favoring agrarian and socialist reform. Battles and skirmishes related to this conflict took place in a number of locales in Mexico but it caused severe problems in Colima, causing major divisions with no formal resolution.

Textile production that began in the 19th century ended by the mid 20th century, though farmers continued to grow cotton to ship to Guadalajara. In the 1940s, the Tecomán Valley began to be intensively cultivated, creating a new source income for the state, with limes as the principle crop, and leading to the development of agro-industry.

The Universidad (Popular) de Colima was founded in 1942.

Much of the history of the latter 20th century into the present revolves around economic development. A hurricane devastated the state in 1959. The Plan Colima was conceived and executed to improve the general infrastructure of the state during the 1980s by then Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid. It was prompted mostly by road congestion due to port shipping in Manzanillo as well as the growing tourism sector. It was designed to facilitate in-state transportation and connect the state better to the rest of Mexico. The main aspect of the plan was the construction of highways such as the highway that connects Manzanillo to Guadalajara and then onto Tampico. This highway was amplified at the end of the decade and made a toll road on approach to Manzanillo. The last decades have seen a new wave of industrial construction with the building of facilities for businesses such as Cementos Apasco, Citrojugo, Brun Foods, Embotelladora de Tecomán, Consorcio Minero Benito Juárez-Peña Colorada, Grupo Agroindustrial de Occidente, AMTEX and others.

Mexico&#x27;s struggles with drug traffickers include the state, which is along Pacific Coast smuggling routes. For the first quarter of 2011, there were 52 registered homicides in the state, most linked to organized crime. This is significantly higher than previous years with most of these occurring in Colima, Villa de Alvarez and Manzanillo.

==Archaeology==
A very early culture in Colima was Capacha culture, developing in the region between 2000 and 1200 BCE.

El Chanal is located four km north of the city of Colima. It is a complex of pyramid platforms with stairs, a Mesoamerican ballcourt and a number of plazas. A distinctive feature of the site are stones with glyphs that are found on stairways.

La Campana is in the urban area of Villa de Álvarez. It is a ceremonial center with various temples and pyramidal platforms with rounded edges. At least one of the platforms was used as a mausoleum with the tomb inside still visible.

==Education==
The state has 307 preschools, 510 primary schools, 131 middle schools and 57 high school and vocational level schools. Today, over 85% of the population finishes primary school. Just under 90% of those who start middle school finish. Over 91% of the population over the age of 15 is literate. About 12% of the population has a university level education and 26% less than primary.

High school level education is available in all regions of the state, with just under sixty percent of those starting a program finishing it, with most that do not dropping out.

The state system also has schools dedicated to special education, vocational training and early childhood centers for those needing various types of physical and educational therapy. Literacy programs for adults are handled by INEA and CONAFE.

Higher education consists of a number of technological schools, universities and teachers&#x27; colleges. Just over half of these are located in the city of Colima, with about 19% in Villa de Alvarez and eleven percent in Tecomán. Most technology related higher education is provided by the Instituto Tecnológico de Colima, with 76% of the students, followed by ITESM-Colima with 7.6% and Instituto Autónomo de Educación Superior de Tecomán with 16.2%. Most of the general university education is provided by the University of Colima (over 93%) with the rest attending the Universidad Autónoma del Pacífico. The main teachers&#x27; colleges are the Instituto Superior de Educación Normal de Colima and the Universidad Pedagógica Nacional. The main providers of post graduate education are the University of Colima and ITESM-Colima.

The University of Colima was founded in 1940, following the educational philosophy of President Lázaro Cárdenas meant to provide higher education to the poorer classes. Today, the university offers high school level classes along with undergraduate and graduate degrees. Much of the institution&#x27;s current size and offering is due to growth in the 1980s, and during that time its reputation in Mexico and abroad increased. Most of the university&#x27;s majors are concentrated in agriculture, industry and commerce with aim of enhancing Colima&#x27;s economy.

The Instituto Tecnológico de Colima was founded in 1976 with three majors in engineering and business with the aim of providing an alternative education focusing on preparing students for industry and service markets. Since then it has added majors in biotechnology, computer science, mechatronics and architecture, offering six undergraduate degrees and one master&#x27;s degree.

<text>The Boston Beer Company is an American brewery founded in 1984 by James &quot;Jim&quot; Koch and Rhonda Kallman. Boston Beer Company&#x27;s first brand of beer was named Samuel Adams after Founding Father Samuel Adams, an American revolutionary patriot. Since its founding, Boston Beer has started several other brands, and in 2019 completed a merger with Dogfish Head Brewery.

The Boston Beer Company is the fourth largest brewer in the United States, with products available throughout the United States and internationally.

==History==

===Early history===

The Boston Beer Company was founded in 1984 by James &quot;Jim&quot; Koch and Rhonda Kallman. The initial beer offering was &quot;Samuel Adams Boston Lager&quot;, a 4.8% abv amber or Vienna lager. Koch, the sixth-generation, first-born son to follow in his family&#x27;s brewing footsteps, brewed his first batch of the beer in his kitchen, using the original family recipe for &quot;Louis Koch Lager&quot;. At the time, Koch was working at Boston Consulting Group after receiving BA, MBA and JD degrees from Harvard University. While serving in his role as a manufacturing consultant at BCG, Koch developed a business plan for a locally focused beer company. He invested $100,000 of his own money and raised additional funds from investors, family members, and friends including former classmates and BCG colleagues. The company was organized as a limited liability partnership; most early investors did not have active roles in the company. However, one early investor, John B. Wing, held a board seat until 2002.

Koch named his beer after the Boston patriot Samuel Adams, who fought for American independence, and who also had inherited a brewing tradition from his father. In March 1985, Koch introduced the beer as &quot;Samuel Adams Boston Lager&quot;, over Patriot&#x27;s Day weekend which honors the first battle of the American Revolution and today is more widely known for the running of the Boston Marathon. Six weeks later, Samuel Adams was voted &quot;Best Beer in America&quot; at the Great American Beer Festival, in which 93 national and regional beers competed. The beer was first put on tap at Doyle&#x27;s Cafe in Jamaica Plain.

Initially, Koch rented excess capacity and brewed the beer at the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, best known for their Iron City brand of beer. As sales increased Koch developed other contract arrangements at various brewing facilities with excess capacity, ranging from Stroh breweries, Portland&#x27;s original Blitz-Weinhard brewery (shuttered in 1999), Cincinnati&#x27;s Hudepohl-Schoenling brewery (eventually purchased by the Boston Beer Company in early 1997), and industry giant SABMiller. The Boston Beer Company also has a small R&amp;D brewery located in Boston (Jamaica Plain), Massachusetts, where public tours and beer tastings are offered. The brewery occupies part of the premises of the old Haffenreffer Brewery.

===1990s – present===
In 1997, Jim Koch returned to his hometown of Cincinnati to purchase the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewery, where his father apprenticed in the 1940s. This was also an important step the company took to reduce reliance on contract brewing.
The Boston Beer Company went public, selling shares of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol, &quot;SAM&quot;. These shares, however, have no voting rights, while the company is controlled through its Class B Common Stock, of which Koch owns 100% of the shares.

Boston Beer launched Hardcore Cider in 1997, and Twisted Tea brand in 2000. In 2007, the Boston Beer Company purchased the former F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Company brewery in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley. The brewery had been owned by Diageo North America, Inc. and used for the production of Smirnoff Ice malt beverages since 2001. By 2012, Samuel Adams was producing two-thirds of all its beer at the Breinigsville facility, and it has increased brewing capacity there. In 2012 Boston Beer Company launched the Angry Orchard hard cider company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

From 2000 to 2002, the company sponsored a radio show on WNEW-FM in New York called &quot;Opie &amp; Anthony&quot;. The hosts created a promotion called &quot;Sex for Sam&quot;, in which hosts Opie and Anthony encouraged couples to have sex in notable public places in New York City. On August 15, 2002, a Virginia couple was charged with public lewdness after attempting to have sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral; this led to the firing of the radio hosts a week later.

In October 2007, in an incident referred to by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as &quot;Sam Adams v. Sam Adams&quot;, the Boston Beer Company demanded that control of the domain names &quot;samadamsformayor.com&quot; and &quot;mayorsamadams.com&quot; be turned over to the company. The domains had been purchased by an employee of the Portland, Oregon radio station NewsRadio 1190 KEX for the campaign of Portland mayoral candidate, Sam Adams. In a cease-and-desist letter, the company expressed concern that consumers might confuse the mayoral candidate with their beer. In an interview with the Associated Press the company said it was willing to discuss Adams&#x27; use of his name on his Web sites, &quot;probably for the length of the time the election is being held&quot;.

In April 2008, the Boston Beer Company issued its first product recall because of potential defects found in certain glass bottles manufactured by a third-party supplier which, at the time, supplied about a quarter of the bottles the Boston Beer Company used. The Boston Beer Company stated that they believed fewer than 1% of bottles from the supplier could contain small pieces of glass and issued a recall for the safety of consumers. There were no reports of injuries. News of the recall led to shares of the company temporarily dropping by more than 3%.

On July 4, 2013, a video commercial for Sam Adams beer was rolled out on the July 4th holiday that created controversy over an omitted phrase. The manufacturer decided to leave out &quot;endowed by their creator&quot; in its invocation of the Declaration of Independence which outraged critics. But Sam Adams said they were just following trade association rules. The company said in a statement:
&quot;The Beer Institute Advertising Code says, &#x27;Beer advertising and marketing materials should not include religion or religious themes.&#x27; We agree with that and try to adhere to these guidelines.&quot;

As of 2014, the company had 1,325 employees at its breweries in Boston, Massachusetts; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania.

In 2018, the company pushed for changes to the definition of &quot;craft brewery&quot; in order to accommodate a continuing shift away from beer-only operations toward other brewed products including ciders.

On May 9, 2019, Boston Beer Company acquired Delaware-based Dogfish Head Brewery for $300 million. As part of the merger, Dogfish Head owner Sam Calagione and his wife, Mariah, became the second largest non-institutional owners of Boston Beer Company.

In 2020, Boston Beer Company invested $85 million in its Cincinnati plant to quadruple its canning capacity of Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard, Twisted Tea, and Truly Hard Seltzer.

==Products==
;Samuel Adams Boston Lager
Following Jim Koch&#x27;s great-great grandfather&#x27;s recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.

;Samuel Adams Rebel IPA
First brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India pale ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo. In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale.

;Sam Adams Light
Introduced in 2001, Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. There was consideration to name the brew &quot;Turtle Adams&quot; after Sam Adams’ pet turtle. The company previously sold Boston Lightship, which was introduced in 1987.

;Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection
These Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood. The beers in this collection are American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.

;Samuel Adams Utopias
The company followed this up in 2002 with &quot;Utopias&quot;; at 24% ABV, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new &quot;vintages&quot; of &quot;Utopias&quot; annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% ABV by 2007.

&quot;Utopias&quot; is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released. Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of &quot;Utopias&quot; cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.

Because of legal restrictions, &quot;Utopias&quot; is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.

;Cranberry Lambic
Since 1990, the company has produced a seasonal fruit beer labeled &quot;Cranberry Lambic&quot;. &quot;Lambic&quot; describes a spontaneously fermented beer generally produced in Brussels or the nearby Pajottenland region, and the Samuel Adams product is not spontaneously fermented, consumers and brewers charged that &quot;Cranberry Lambic&quot; was mislabeled and could cause consumer confusion. Michael Jackson, a leading beer critic, called it &quot;a misleading name&quot;. Grant Wood, Senior Brewing Manager at Boston Beer, defended the name, saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t consider it mislabeling. Whenever I have served the Cranberry Lambic, I have always been really up front about it. Is it a true lambic made in that region in Belgium? No. Does it taste like one? Yes. So it&#x27;s sort of our homage to the style without the pain and agony of it.&quot;

;Triple Bock
Triple Bock was released in 1994, 1995, and 1997. It has a black, opaque color, no carbonation, and at 17.5% ABV it was the strongest beer brewed at the time it was introduced. Maple syrup was added in the brewing process. Triple Bock was a &quot;forerunner&quot; of later strong beers from Samuel Adams — Millennium (21% ABV released in 1999 only), and Utopias (24–26% ABV first released in 2002).

;Seasonal beers

In addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has four seasonal offerings. The spring seasonal beers are Cold Snap, a Witbier and Escape Route, a Kölsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale and Porch Rocker, a radler.

;Malt beverages
Beginning in 2001, Boston Beer began to produce Twisted Tea, a 5% abv malt beverage marketed as a &quot;hard iced tea&quot;. Its brand portfolio has since grown to include a number of flavored varieties, including a &quot;half and half&quot; variant designed to mimic an Arnold Palmer, and is primarily marketed in the American southeast.

;Hard seltzer
Boston Beer Company launched a line of hard seltzers in 2016 under the brand name Truly Spiked &amp; Sparkling.

;Subsidiaries
Boston Beer operates a number of other sub-brands, including &quot;The Traveler Brewing Company&quot; (which focuses on shandy variants), &quot;Coney Island Brewing Company&quot; (purchased from Schmaltz Brewery and brewing a nationally available line of hard sodas in addition to beer exclusive to the New York City market), and also owns the Los Angeles-based Angel City Brewery and the Concrete Beach Brewery in Miami.

==Weihenstephan partnership==
In October 2009, the Boston Beer Company announced a two-year project with German brewery Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan to jointly produce a new craft beer named Infinium, to be marketed in both Germany and the U.S. The brewers described the beer, which was sold in corked bottles and had alcohol content of 10.3% abv, as a Champagne-like &quot;crisp pale brew&quot;. Approximately 15,000 cases were released in North America in December 2010 at a suggested retail price of $20 per 750 mL bottle, Marketed towards drinkers who would rather toast with beer than Champagne on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Infinium is described by the brewers as &quot;the first new beer style created under the Reinheitsgebot in over a hundred years&quot;. This contract ended in 2011.

==Philanthropy==

===Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream===
In 2008, Jim Koch created the Brewing the American Dream program. As of 2015, the company had helped more than 4,000 entrepreneurs and together with their lending partner, Accion, made close to 400 loans totaling $400 million.

===2008 Hops shortage===
In early 2008, amidst a worldwide shortage of hops—a key ingredient in beer—Boston Beer Company agreed to sell 20,000 pounds of its hops, at cost, to craft brewers throughout the United States. The company selected 108 craft brewers to divide the 20,000 pounds they had spare.

Samuel Adams shared their hops again in June 2012.

===LongShot American Homebrew Competition===
Created in 1996, the Samuel Adams LongShot American Homebrew Competition is an annual competition among amateur homebrewers. Homebrewers submit their brew to a series of judging and taste tests with the chance to see their creation in larger-scale production and sold on store shelves as part of a Samuel Adams mixed 6-pack the following year.

==Sponsorship==
Starting in the 2018 season, Boston Beer Company&#x27;s Samuel Adams became the official beer of the Boston Red Sox, replacing Budweiser. The eight-year deal will last through the 2025 season and include signage and a Sam roof deck. The agreement also allows Boston Beer to use the Red Sox Logo for marketing purposes, run Red Sox related contests with tickets to games.

Since the 2021 season, Twisted Tea has been the naming sponsor of Team Twisted Tea Suzuki in the AMA Motocross and Supercross championships.

<text>Culiacán, officially Culiacán Rosales, is a city in northwestern Mexico, the capital and largest city of both Culiacán Municipality and the state of Sinaloa. The city was founded on 29 September 1531 by the Spanish conquerors Lázaro de Cebreros and Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán under the name &quot;Villa de San Miguel&quot;, referring to its patron saint, Michael the Archangel.

As of the 2020 INEGI census, Culiacán had an estimated population of 808,416, making it the 21st most populous city in Mexico. Its metropolitan area, with a population of 1,003,530, was the 17th most populous metropolitan area in Mexico.

The city is in a valley on the slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental, at the confluence of the Tamazula and Humaya Rivers, where both join to form the Culiacán River 55 m above sea level.

== Etymology ==
The genuine Aztec name of the Nahuatl language is Colhuacan or Culhuacan, which is from &quot;colhua&quot; or &quot;culhua&quot; and &quot;can&quot;, which is a place, and its meaning varies according to different historians: &quot;snake place&quot;, &quot;crooked hill&quot; or &quot;where walkers twist the path&quot;. The most accepted theory is &quot;place of the colhuas&quot;, or &quot;inhabited by the colhua tribe&quot;, and the most frequent meaning is &quot;place of worshiping the god Coltzin&quot;.

==History==

=== Prehispanic era ===
An ancient Indigenous settlement called Huey Colhuacan dates back to Tecpatl, corresponding to the year 628 CE. The Aztecs built it during their pilgrimage. Its exact location is unknown, but it is assumed that it was close to the current town of Culiacáncito.

===Founding ===
The city known today as Culiacán was co-founded in 1531 by conquistadors Lázaro de Cebreros and Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán under the name &quot;Villa de San Miguel&quot;. Upon their arrival in the 16th century, the Spanish found the existence of farmhouses organized in indigenous nations by the tribe of the Tahues, which brought together a group of people of the same origin and language who had a common tradition.

Other indigenous peoples that inhabited the original territory of Culiacán were the Tebacas, Pacaxes, Sabaibo, and Achires.

After their war of conquest, in 1531, de Cebreros and de Guzmán organized the territories acquired into three provinces. One of them was Culiacán, which was delimited to the South by the Elota River and to the North by the Mocorito River, depending on the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia. Organized in this way, the territory lasted until 1786, the year in which the administration system was implemented, with Sonora and Sinaloa forming the province of Arizpe and the older province of Culiacán remaining the same.

=== Independent Mexico ===
On 6 October 1821, independence was sworn in Culiacán. Culiacán was granted the category of city on 21 July 1823, when the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa separated by decree from Congress. In 1824, by the Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation, Sinaloa and Sonora met again, forming the Estado de Occidente. On 13 October 1830, the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa were definitively separated by decree, with the city of Culiacán designated the capital of the state of Sinaloa. In 1861, during the conservative government of the French Intervention, prefectures were installed, and the Municipalities Law was decreed that divided the Districts into City Councils. The Badiraguato District was suppressed and became part of the Culiacán District as a municipality.

From 1859 to 1873, the capital of Sinaloa was moved from Culiacán to Mazatlán. In the Restored Republic, Governor Eustaquio Buelna confronted the merchants of the port. He returned to Culiacán, and the Local Congress gave it the status of capital of the state.

=== Porfirian and revolutionary times ===
In 1878, Culiacán had three City Halls, whose headwaters were Culiacán, Quilá, and Badiraguato. This remained the case until 1880 when Badiraguato returned to being a district with the limits that previously corresponded to it.

Municipalities were established by law in 1912 as a new form of internal government. However, this law did not come into force until 1915, when political directories were suppressed, causing the districts to become free municipalities. Culiacán was established as a municipality by decree on 8 April 1915. Within its original limits was the current Municipality of Navolato, which was segregated from Culiacán on 27 August 1982, depriving the city of of valley agriculture.

Sometime later, the State Congress approved the extension of the capital city&#x27;s name, giving it its current official name of Culiacán de Rosales. &quot;Rosales&quot; honors the great Mexican military man Antonio Rosales, who fought in the second French Intervention and the Reform War, along with serving as the governor of Sinaloa.

=== After World War II ===

Beginning in the late 1950s, Culiacán became the birthplace of an incipient underground economy based on illicit drugs exported to the United States. The completion of the Pan-American Highway and the regional airport in the 1960s accelerated the expansion of workable distribution infrastructure for the enterprising few families that would later come to dominate the international drug cartels along Mexico&#x27;s Pacific Northwest. The Sinaloa Cartel made Culiacán its primary base.

On 17 October 2019, after an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to arrest one of the cartel leaders, widespread gunfights broke out across the city, leading to multiple deaths, in what has been called the &quot;Battle of Culiacán&quot;. One of Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán&#x27;s relatives, Ovidio Guzmán, was arrested by police, but were forced to release him.

== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms of the municipality and the city of Culiacán in Sinaloa, Mexico, has various elements that represent the history of the municipality yesterday and today.

Rolando Arjona Amábilis was the artist behind the official coat of arms of the Municipality of Culiacán, which was made official through municipal decree number 13 May 26, 1960, and published in number 90 of the Official Newspaper of the State of Sinaloa on 30 July 1960. Its shape is square with rounded corners ending in a point. The entire face of the shield is covered with a carmine color. In the center is a hieroglyph representing a hill with a human head inclined forward. This glyph alludes to Coltzin, &quot;the crooked god&quot;, an authentic figure of Nahuatl mythology, who gave its name to the Nahuatlaca-Colhua tribe and, in turn, to the town of its residence, Colhuacán or Teocolhuacán.

Across the face of the shield, there are symbols of water referring to rivers. In the central part and towards the left side, a cross is followed by a path on which footprints can be observed that end in a small construction. These motifs symbolize the missionaries of San Miguel de Culiacán left for the North, and they are invoked as an obligatory tribute to the goodness and heroism of the missionaries.

On the carmine border, the word &quot;Culiacán&quot; can be read in its upper part, and in its lower part the word &quot;Colhuacán&quot;, which corresponds to the true name of the place in the Nahuatl language. In the upper part of the shield, there is a hill with a germinating seed and the figure of a golden sun, alluding both to the tropical climate of this region and to the fundamentally agricultural effort of its inhabitants.

== Politics ==

The government of the municipality of Culiacán corresponds to its City Council, this is elected by a universal, direct, and secret vote for a period of three years that is not renewable for the immediate period but if not continuously, and that begins to exercise its position on the day 1 January of the year following your election; The city council is integrated by the Municipal President into a Procurator Trustee and the body of councilors made up of 18 representatives, once they are elected by relative majority and seven by the principle of proportional representation.

=== Syndications ===
For its internal regime, the municipality is subdivided into 17 receiverships, which in turn are divided into police stations, the 17 receiverships of the municipality are: El Salado, Higueras de Abuya, Baila, Aguaruto, Emiliano Zapata, Adolfo López Mateos (El Tamarindo), Jesús María, Las Tapias, Quilá, Sanalona, San Lorenzo, Tacuichamona, Tepuche, Imala, Costa Rica, Culiacáncito and Eldorado.

The city of Culiacán Rosales occupies only a part of the municipality of Culiacán and in 2010 had an urban area of 65 km2, being the largest in the state of Sinaloa and has a population of 675,773 inhabitants (of which 329,608 are men and 346,165 are women), according to the 2010 Population and Housing Census carried out by the (INEGI), resulting in a population density of 10,396.5 inhabitants / km2. concentrating 78.7% of the total urban population of the Municipality. The ethnic groups most represented in the Municipality are the Mixtec and Nahuatl, the total population of indigenous language speakers (HLI population) is 13,081 people. On the other hand, in the urban area of Culiacán, there are only 3,536 indigenous people.

The city ranks 20th in number of foreign population, which amounts to 6,693 inhabitants, which represent almost 1% of the total population; Among the main nationalities are Americans, Canadians, Spanish, Italians, Greeks, Argentines, Cubans, Colombians, Brazilians, Chinese, Japanese, Russians, Ukrainians, Venezuelans, Dominicans, Germans, among others.

The presence of people of Greek origin that occurred in the 1940s and 1950s coincided with the incipient but flourishing emergence of agriculture. This attracted a lot of Hellenic labor for the tillage of the land. This attracted a greater number of people; today, they make up the few thousand people who continue to live in the city. It is believed that the Greek community is the largest in Mexico.
=== Housing and urbanism ===

The total number of dwellings that exist in the city is 221,144, of which only 176,799 dwellings are occupied, with an average of 3.81 inhabitants per inhabited dwelling. In general, cement roofs, walls, and floors are used for the construction of the house, although homes or buildings do not cease to exist, most of them have sheet roofs and earth floors, this occurs mainly in the area peripheral to the south of the city, where the humble settlements of new inhabitants who arrive with the hope of obtaining a better quality of life proliferate.

Of the 176,799 occupied dwellings, 173,704 have electricity, 171,614 have piped water, 171,489 have drainage, and 169,550 have the 3 services simultaneously.

=== City zoning ===
The city is divided into different areas mainly:

The Historical Center of Culiacán is the original area of the city, in which most of the buildings of the Spanish colonization between the 16th and 19th centuries are found, it comprises a territorial extension of approximately 247,123 ha (2,471 km2). From the &#x27;70s onwards, there was a process of depopulation of the area due to the high costs of rents, the bustle of the main streets and avenues, and the priority of having more commercial spaces, but in recent years there has been a process of repopulation of the same with the construction of apartments in the periphery of the Center and a project of urban reorganization in which it is intended to have a higher population density.

Las Colonias, which are the first settlements that populated the perimeter around the original urban area by people from different social strata to have a largely wide space close to the Center; Among the best known and with the largest population, we find: Infonavit Humaya, Tierra Blanca, 6 January, Stase, Juntas de Humaya, Almada, Miguel Alemán, Centro Sinaloa, Morelos, Palmito, El Barrio, Aurora, etc.

The subdivisions, for their part, are places divided by different construction companies, in which there are, in certain sections, the same style of housing, housing people of lower middle class, middle and upper middle class, among the best known are: La Conquista, Villas del Rio, Valle Alto, Los Pinos, Villa Verde and Villa Fontana.

Residentials are considered to be areas strategically built for people with high purchasing power, with spacious houses, and large green areas, and in most cases, they are delimited as private, and we find: Tres Ríos, Chapultepec, Los Álamos, Guadalupe, Lomas de Guadalupe, Colinas de San Miguel, Montebello, La Campiña, Las Quintas, Isla Musalá and La Primavera.

Independent of these areas, we find one that stands out for its extension and its level of influence at the state level: the Tres Ríos Urban Development, which was started in 1990 with the aim of creating a better commercial, residential, and entertainment area for the city. The development also took advantage of the lands adjacent to the Culiacán, Humaya, and Tamazula rivers, embellishing the banks with vegetation and a new boardwalk.

<text>The James River is a river in Virginia that begins in the Appalachian Mountains and flows from the confluence of the Cowpasture and Jackson Rivers in Botetourt County to the Chesapeake Bay. The river length extends to if the Jackson River, the longer of its two headwaters, is included. It is the longest river in Virginia. Jamestown and Williamsburg, Virginia&#x27;s first colonial capitals, and Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s current capital, lie on the James River.

==History==

The Native Americans who populated the area east of the Fall Line in the late 16th and early 17th centuries called the James River the Powhatan River, named for the Powhatans who occupied the area. The Jamestown colonists who arrived in 1607 named it &quot;James&quot; after King James I of England as they constructed the first permanent English settlement in the Americas along the banks of the river about upstream from the Chesapeake Bay.

The navigable portion of the river was the major highway of colonial Virginia during its first 15 years, facilitating supply ships delivering supplies and more emigrants from England. However, for the first five years, despite hopes of discovering gold ores, these ships sent little of monetary value back to the sponsors. In 1612, businessman John Rolfe successfully cultivated a non-native strain of tobacco which proved popular in England. Soon, the river became the primary means of exporting the large hogsheads of this cash crop from an ever-growing number of plantations with wharfs along its banks. This development made the proprietary efforts of the Virginia Company of London successful financially, spurring even more development, investments and immigration. Below the falls at Richmond, many James River plantations had their own wharves, and additional ports and/or early railheads were located at Warwick, Bermuda Hundred, City Point, Claremont, Scotland, and Smithfield, and, during the 17th century, the capital of the colony at Jamestown.

Navigation of the James River played an important role in early Virginia commerce and in the settlement of the interior, although growth of the colony was primarily in the Tidewater region during the first 75 years. The upper reaches of the river above the head of navigation at the fall line were explored by fur-trading parties sent out by Abraham Wood during the late 17th century.

Although ocean-going ships were unable to navigate beyond present-day Richmond, portage of products and navigation with smaller craft to transport crops other than tobacco was feasible. Produce from the Piedmont and Great Valley regions descended the river to seaports at Richmond and Manchester through such port towns as Lynchburg, Scottsville, Columbia and Buchanan.

===James River and Kanawha Canal===
The James River was considered a route for transport of produce from the Ohio Valley. The James River and Kanawha Canal was built for this purpose, to provide a navigable portion of the Kanawha River, a tributary of the Ohio River. For the most mountainous section between the two points, the James River and Kanawha Turnpike was built to provide a portage link for wagons and stagecoaches. However, before the canal could be fully completed, in the mid-19th century, railroads emerged as a more practical technology and eclipsed canals for economical transportation, ending the canal&#x27;s progress at Eagle Rock. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) was completed between Richmond and the Ohio River at the new city of Huntington, West Virginia by 1873, dooming the canal&#x27;s economic prospects. In the late-19th century, the Richmond and Alleghany Railroad was laid along the eastern portion of the canal&#x27;s towpath, and became part of the C&amp;O within 10 years. In modern times, this rail line is used primarily in transporting West Virginia coal to export coal piers at Newport News.

=== Kepone contamination === 
During the 1960s and 1970s, mishandling and dumping of the insecticide Kepone resulted in the contamination of large stretches of the James River estuary downstream of the Allied Signal Company and LifeSciences Product Company plants in Hopewell, Virginia. Because of the pollution, sections of the river were considered &quot;dead&quot; and unfit for human use, and many businesses and restaurants along the river suffered economic losses. In December 1975 Virginia Governor Mills Godwin Jr. shut down the James River to fishing for 100 miles, from Richmond to the Chesapeake Bay. This ban remained in effect for 13 years, until efforts to clean up the river began to show results. A decade of accumulated silt, lying above the contaminated riverbed, helped to reduce levels of the chemical.

=== Clean-up ===
Since the 1970s, the health of the James River has improved substantially. The Chesapeake Bay Agreement of 1983, signed by the governors of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the mayor of the District of Columbia, and the EPA, established baseline environmental protections and promoted regional cooperation conducive to river clean-up. This original agreement has evolved as the Chesapeake Bay Program. The James River Association (JRA), founded in 1976, began publishing State of the James reports in 2016. In their 2023 report, JRA concluded that the &quot;overall grade of the State of the James has improved to a B with a score of 66% from its failing health decades ago.&quot;

==Watershed and course==
The James River drains a catchment comprising . The watershed includes about 4% open water and an area with a population of 2.5 million people (2000). The James River forms near Iron Gate on the border between Alleghany and Botetourt counties, from the confluence of the Cowpasture and Jackson rivers in the Appalachian Mountains. It flows into the Chesapeake Bay at Hampton Roads. Tidal waters extend west to Richmond at the river&#x27;s fall line (the head of navigation). 

Larger tributaries draining to the tidal portion include the Appomattox River, Chickahominy River, Warwick River, Pagan River, and the Nansemond River.

At its mouth near Newport News Point, the Elizabeth River and the Nansemond River join the James River to form the harbor area known as Hampton Roads. Between the tip of the Virginia Peninsula near Old Point Comfort and the Willoughby Spit area of Norfolk in South Hampton Roads, a channel leads from Hampton Roads into the southern portion of the Chesapeake Bay and out to the Atlantic Ocean a few miles further east. Many boats pass through this river to import and export Virginia products.

===Major tributaries===

* Appomattox River 
* Chickahominy River 
* Warwick River
* Pagan River 
* Nansemond River
* Looney Creek
* Cowpasture River
* Jackson River
* Craig Creek
* Catawba Creek
* Maury River


==Recreation==

The James River contains many parks and other recreational attractions. Canoeing, fishing, kayaking, hiking, and swimming are some of the activities that people enjoy along the river during the summer. From the river&#x27;s start in the Blue Ridge Mountains to Richmond, numerous rapids and pools offer fishing and whitewater rafting. The most intense whitewater stretch is a segment that ends in downtown Richmond where the river goes over the fall line. This is the only place in the country where extensive class III (class IV with above average river levels) whitewater conditions exist within sight of skyscrapers. Below the fall line east of Richmond, the river is better suited for water skiing and other large boat recreation. Here the river is known for its blue catfish, reaching average sizes of , with frequent catches exceeding . In the Chesapeake watershed, the James River is the last confirmed holdout for the nearly extirpated Atlantic sturgeon. In May 2007 a survey identified 175 sturgeon remaining in the entire river, with 15 specimens exceeding .

==Dams==
Due to its potential for generating mechanical power for rotating machinery such as grist mills, hydroelectric power, and as a water route for trade, many dams have been built across the James River since the time of European settlement of the region. While most of these dams have been removed or failed, several dams still exist along the upper course of the river. From the head of the river downstream to Richmond are found the following dams as identified by the current US Army Corps of Engineers National Inventory of Dams:
*The Cushaw Hydroelectric Project near Glasgow and Big Island.
*The Bedford Hydropower Project near Big Island.
*The Big Island Dam near Big Island.
*The Coleman Falls Dam in Coleman Falls
*The Holcomb Rock Dam near Lynchburg.
*The Reusens Dam near Lynchburg.
*The Scotts Mill Dam in Lynchburg.
*The Bosher Dam in Richmond.

The tallest dam is the Reusens Dam, which also has the greatest hydroelectric nameplate capacity and the greatest reservoir capacity. At 1,617 feet, the longest dam is the Cushaw Hydroelectric Project due to the highly angled path the dam takes across the river.

While not identified in the National Inventory of Dams, a very low head weir structure is found below Bosher Dam in Richmond on either side of Williams Island. Known as the &quot;Z-Dam&quot; for its zigzag course on the south side of the island, the current structure was built in 1932 and serves to direct water into Richmond&#x27;s water treatment facility on the north bank. The less than 5 feet tall dam does not serve any power or navigation purpose.

==Bridges==

===Highway bridges below Richmond===
In the Hampton Roads area, the river is as much as wide at points. Due to ocean-going shipping upriver as far as the Port of Richmond, a combination of ferryboats, high bridges and bridge-tunnels are used for highway traffic. Crossings east to west include:

*The Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (I-64)
*The Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel (I-664)
*The James River Bridge (US 17/ US 258/ VA 32)
*The Jamestown Ferry (VA 31) (toll-free)
*The Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge near Hopewell. This is a drawbridge on VA 106 / VA 156 which replaced ferry service in 1966. It was the site of a major collision of a ship in 1977.
*The Varina-Enon Bridge is a high cable-stayed bridge carrying I-295 which was the second of its type in the U.S. when it was completed.
*The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge carries the Pocahontas Parkway (State Route 895) via a high-level bridge to connect to State Route 150 at Interstate 95.

The SR 895 high-level crossing is the last bridge east of the Deepwater Port of Richmond and head of ocean-going navigation at the fall line of the James River. West of this point, potential flooding is more of an engineering concern than clearance for watercraft.

===Highway bridges at Richmond===
The following is a list of extant highway bridges across the James River with one or both ends within the City of Richmond.

* Interstate 95 James River Bridge (I-95)
* Mayo Bridge (US-360)
* Manchester Bridge (US-60)
* Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge (US-1, US-301 and U.S. Bicycle Route 1)
* Boulevard Bridge (VA-161) (toll bridge, restricted weights)
* Powhite Parkway Bridge (Powhite Parkway and VA-76) (toll bridge)
* Huguenot Memorial Bridge (VA-147)
* Edward E. Willey Bridge (VA-150)

===Highway bridges west of Richmond===
The following is a partial, incomplete list of extant highway bridges across the James River west of Richmond.

* World War II Veterans Memorial Bridge (SR 288)
* U.S. Route 522 near Maidens
* State Route 45 near Cartersville
* Columbia Road (Route 690) near Columbia
* U.S. Route 15 near Bremo Bluff
* State Route 602 at Howardsville
* State Route 20 near Scottsville
* State Route 56 near Wingina
* U.S. Route 60 at Bent Creek
* Monacan Bridge (U.S. Route 29 east of Lynchburg)
* Carter Glass Memorial Bridge (U.S. Route 29 Business at Lynchburg)
* John Lynch Memorial Bridge (Lynchburg)
* Blue Ridge Parkway near Big Island
* U.S. Route 501 at Snowden
* State Route 759 at Natural Bridge Station
* State Route 614 at Arcadia
* U.S. Route 11, State Route 43 and U.S. Bicycle Route 76 at Buchanan
* Interstate 81 at Buchanan
* State Route 630 at Springwood
* James Street at Eagle Rock connecting U.S. Route 220 and State Route 43
* U.S. Route 220 near Eagle Rock
* Bridge Street at Glen Wilton
* U.S. Route 220 near Iron Gate

===Bicycles===
The Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel prohibits bicycles, but bicyclists may take the Jamestown Ferry. After a fatal accident on the Boulevard Bridge , the City of Richmond requires bicycles to travel on the sidewalk for the length of the bridge.

==James River Reserve Fleet==

The James River Reserve Fleet is the anchorage () for a large portion of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, called the &quot;James River fleet&quot; or the &quot;ghost fleet&quot;, consisting of &quot;&quot; ships, mostly merchant vessels, that can be activated within 20 to 120 days to provide shipping for the United States during national emergencies, either military or non-military, such as commercial shipping crises. The fleet is managed by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Maritime Administration and is based in Fort Eustis, Virginia. It is a different entity from the United States Navy reserve fleets, which consist largely of warships.

<text>Hidalgo, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Hidalgo, is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, constitute the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It is divided into 84 municipalities and its capital city is Pachuca de Soto. It is located in east-central Mexico and is bordered by San Luis Potosí and Veracruz on the north, Puebla on the east, Tlaxcala and State of Mexico on the south and Querétaro on the west.

In 1869, Benito Juárez created the State of Hidalgo and made Pachuca its capital city; &quot;de Soto&quot; was added later in recognition of , who is considered the most important driving force in creating the state. The state was named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the initiator of the Mexican War of Independence.

The indigenous peoples of the state, such as the Otomi, retain much of their traditional culture. In addition to Mexicans of Spanish descent, there are also notable immigrant cultures: those of the descendants of Cornish miners from Cornwall (located in South West England) who arrived in the 19th century, a few self-proclaimed Italian descendants, and a small Jewish enclave which claims to be descended from Sephardi Jews which came to New Spain in the 16th century.

Hidalgo is known for its mountainous terrain, though part of the state is on a coastal plain. With a population of 2.858 million and an area of roughly 20,813 square km, Hidalgo is one of Mexico&#x27;s smaller states. The state contains a number of ecotourism, cultural and archeological attractions including the Huasteca area, the ruins of Tula, natural hot water springs, old haciendas and mountain ranges.

==History==

Prehistoric artifacts have been found in the Hidalgo regions of Tepeapulco, Tulancingo, Actopan and Huichapan. Their antiquity ranges from 14,000 to 2,500 B.C.E. The oldest evidence of Hidalguense occupation has been found in Huapalcalco in the municipality of Tulancingo The first settlers of these territories were Olmec groups, who exploited deposits of jade and serpentine. Exploitation of obsidian cobbled relief, as in the deposits of the Sierra de las Navajas, developed during the Mesoamerican Preclassic period. The first evidence of social stratification in Hidalgo has been found at La Loma in the municipality of Tepeji del Río de Ocampo.

The modern day state of Hidalgo is located within the pre-Hispanic region of Mesoamerica. Numerous migrations of indigenous people took place through here, mostly arriving or passing through from the north, with many eventually settling in the Valley of Mexico. The Toltecs initially settled in Xochicoatlán, now the municipality of Molango, at the beginning of the 7th century. From here they dispersed to locales such as Huejutla and Tollatzingo (now called Tulancingo) where they eventually had their capital of Tollan, today known as Tula.

The Toltecs were eventually overrun by Chichimecas, who established their capital in Metztitlán. The Aztecs arrived in the 12th century, initially establishing themselves in Mixquiahuala, then founding Tizayuca later. Eventually, the Aztecs took over most of what is now the southern portion of the state, incorporating it into the Aztec Empire.

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the conquistadors carved out territories for themselves from Aztec lands. Hernán Cortés took possession of lands to the northeast of Mexico City extending into modern Hidalgo state. Evangelization efforts followed soon thereafter with the first Franciscans arriving in 1523. This changed the social, economic and cultural structure of the areas as the Spanish took control of natural resources — especially minerals — and the labor the Indians provided. It also led to a massive decrease in the native population, especially during the governorship of the area by Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán. By the 18th century, the economy of the Hidalgo area was dominated by mining and agricultural haciendas. Much of the agricultural production during the colonial period was centered on livestock such as sheep and pigs as well as the making of pulque from the native maguey plant. However, the mining of silver, gold and other metals in the Pachuca/Real del Monte area would prove to be the economic backbone of the area through the colonial period and into most of post Independence period. The fortunes of the mining industry would rise and fall during the colonial period; one of the most productive eras came under the control of Pedro Romero de Terreros in the 18th century.
Despite Spanish control and evangelization efforts since the 16th century, many of the Otomi and other indigenous groups of the area had not been fully subjugated by the 18th century, especially in the Sierra Gorda and Sierra Baja areas. These groups and others manage a significant amount of success in maintaining cultural, political and economic autonomy through the colonial period. Much of the state still maintains a number of strong indigenous identities.

Many in Hidalgo, especially the indigenous, supported Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla&#x27;s cause, providing leaders such as José María Correa and José Antonio Magos, both of whom were active in the Mezquital Valley area. However, no major battles of the Mexican War of Independence were fought in the state. Instead, a number of smaller operations against local Spaniards were conducted. When the war ended in 1821, the country was divided into a number of states. The modern state of Hidalgo was initially part of the very large territory called “Mexico” (which extended in all directions from Mexico City), which eventually was split with the remaining portion becoming the modern State of Mexico. What is now Hidalgo was originally the districts of Tula, Tulancingo and Huejutla of the former entity. The state of Hidalgo would not be formally created until the 1860s.

The economic consequences to the mines of Pachuca and Real del Monte during the War of Independence were ruinous. In 1824, British mining companies were brought in to revive the sector. The British introduced steam-powered machinery and other modern techniques as well as a large quantity of Cornish miners. Many of these Cornish miners stayed and English names and foods such as pasties (called “pastes” in Spanish) help define the state, especially in the Pachuca and Real del Monte areas. These Englishmen were forced to sell their interest to Mexican capitalists in 1849, and the mining sector fell again.

In 1861, the government of the vast State of Mexico was centered in Toluca, west of Mexico City. The distance of the capital was one of the reasons why the state of Hidalgo would eventually separate. When French forces invaded central Mexico in 1862, the large territory of Mexico was divided into three military sectors for defence. The second district had its capital in Actopan and its borders were roughly commensurate with that of modern Hidalgo. The French succeeded in placing Maximilian I on the throne of Mexico, who visited Pachuca in 1865. Soon thereafter, insurgent activity against the French government intensified and after Maximilian was overthrown, the new republican government decided to make this military district the state of Hidalgo in 1869. The state was named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the first leader of the Mexican Independence movement.

From the establishment of the state until the Porfirio Díaz period, the economy, especially the mining sector was erratic. In the late 1880s, a number of modern inventions, such as the telegraph, telephone and railroad helped the Hidalgo economy. It also brought in another wave of foreign investment in the mining industry. By the mid-1900s, much of the mining production in Pachuca and Real del Monte was controlled by U.S. based interests such as the United States Mining Smelting and Refining Company. Pulque haciendas, primarily selling to nearby Mexico City, were prosperous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The prosperity of the state was best seen in the capital of Pachuca with the construction of many civic structures, but many rural areas were still quite impoverished. This situation would make the state favor the oncoming Mexican Revolution.

During the Mexican Revolution, local armed groups, such as the one led by Francisco P. Mariel in Huejutla, faced off against government troops. Forces led by Nicolas Flores took Jacala and threatened Zimapan and Ixmiquilpan in 1911. Later that same year Gabriel Hernández took Tulancingo and Pachuca, forcing the then-governor out of power. After Porfirio Díaz fled the country, several factions vied for power here. The government of the state was seized in 1915 by Agustin Sangins, who declared himself in favor of Victoriano Huerta, prompting opponents to take up arms in the Huasteca area, Jacala and Tulancingo. Victory initially went to those in support of Huerta. When Huerta&#x27;s government fell, the state had a chaotic succession of governors, each of whom supported different factions. When the war finally wound down by 1920, the state had a new constitution.
In 1920, the first airmail flight took place with a biplane piloted by Horacio Ruiz Gaviño taking off from Pachuca and landing in Mexico City 53 minutes later carrying 543 letters, 61 postcards and other items.
The war left the mining industry in ruins again and the desertion of same by the American companies. Modernization of the nearly destroyed infrastructure began in the 1920s with the reconstruction of telephone lines and the construction of highways within the state. In the 1930s, a number of companies such as Cruz Azul Cement were expropriated and popular credit schemes such as the Banco de Credito Ejidal were created. Over 130 schools in rural areas were also built. Construction and modernization of infrastructure would continue through the rest of the 20th century.
This wave of mining activity declined in the mid-20th century, causing the deterioration of the state&#x27;s economy, especially in the Pachuca area. In the 1950s and 1960s efforts were undertaken to shift the state&#x27;s economy from agriculture and mining to manufacturing. In 1952, an automotive motor production facility called Diesel Nacional (DINA) was constructed. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo in 1961, with the purpose of turning out engineers and other professionals to provide the impetus for the development of industry. These efforts soon paid dividends and construction growth, especially of suburban subdivisions for workers in newly built factories.

The growth of the Greater Mexico City area reached the southern border of Hidalgo state in the late 20th and early 21st century with the municipality of Tizayuca formally added into the region in 2005.

One problem the extreme southern part of the state has had in the past decade is the contamination of water from the drainage of the Valley of Mexico. Mexico City pumps out excess water from the area, as the valley has no natural drainage, to the north into Mexico and Hidalgo states. This water is increasingly polluted and is causing damage to these northern zones. The state is negotiating federal and other help to treat and recycle this water so that it does not do further damage to state agriculture and environment.

At least 93 people, including eight children, were killed, and 46 were injured when a clandestine gasoline pipe exploded in Tlahuelilpan on January 19, 2019.

==Demographics==


Several indigenous groups within the state have managed to maintain a relatively strong independent cultural identity since the Conquest. These ethnic groups include the Nahua, the Otomis and the Tepehuas, each still speaking their own language. The largest group is the Otomi, which has over 250,000 speakers in the state. The total number of people who speak an indigenous language of any kind was estimated at 320,029 in 2005.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.58% of Hidalgo&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

Population of the state historically has risen and fallen based on the state of the economy especially, the health of the mining sector. When mining activity fell in the mid-20th century, the population fell as well. The population began to recover in the 1980s. From then until 2000, the population grew from 1,547,493 to 2,235,591, leaving the state with a large number of people under the age of thirty. The mining sector has also been responsible for immigration to the state, most notably that of the Cornish in the 19th century in the Pachuca and Real de Monte areas. While most descendants of these Cornish immigrants now are monolingual Spanish speakers, many have retained the Protestant faith. The Cornish have influenced the cuisine here as well, with one of Hidalgo&#x27;s signature dishes being “pastes” (pa-stays), which are Cornish dough pockets filled with Mexican style meat, vegetable and sweet fillings.

Over 70% identify themselves as Catholic with significant minorities as Protestant or Evangelical. Another significant minority are those who practice the Jewish faith. Many of these claim ancestry from Sephardi Jews who came to New Spain in the 16th century to escape the Inquisition in Spain. When it reached New Spain, these people moved to the rural hills to continue their practice clandestinely. These are mostly concentrated in the community of Venta Prieta. While their claims have not been proven, there are indications that they are true. Most practitioners in Venta Prieta are Conservative.

==Culture==

Hidalgo&#x27;s literary history extends back to the 19th century with the oldest notable writers being Ignacio Rodríguez Galván and José María Rodríguez y Cos. Rodríguez Galván was born in 1816 in Tizayuca and is considered to be the first Mexican Romance writer. He wrote poetry and plays as well as founding a newspaper called Año Nuevo. Rodríguez y Cos was born in 1823 in Tulancingo and represents Positivism in Mexico, writing poetry and plays. The most important poet from the 20th century is Efrén Rebolledo from Actopán, who lived from 1877 to 1929. Other important writers from this century include Xavier Sorondo, Margarita Michelena, Gabriel Vargas, Ricardo Garibay, Gonzalo Martré and Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa Notable painters appear in the 20th century including Byron Galvez, Yadira Gutiérrez and José Hernández Delgadillo. The best known musician from the state is Nicandro Castillo, who wrote mostly popular music in the mid-20th century. As part of a performing group called Los Plateados, his work became part of a number of Mexican films, including &quot;Cuando habla el corazón&quot;, &quot;Seda, sangre y sol&quot; and &quot;Así se quiere en Jalisco&quot;. Other important musicians from the state include Abundio Martínez and Demetrio Vite Hernández.

The best known celebrity and artist from the state is Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta, better known as El Santo. Born in Tulancingo in 1917, not only was he Mexico&#x27;s best known lucha libre wrestler, he experienced success in the movies, playing his lucha libre character battling evil. He never took off his mask in public, until a few weeks before his death in 1984.

Day of the Dead in the state is referred to as the &quot;Xantolo&quot; which extends from October 31 to November 2. Like in other parts of Mexico, the days around November 2 honor the dead with altars and offerings, although each community has its own variations. One area which is known for its traditions is Huejutla de Reyes, where altars dedicated to the dead are especially large and profusely decorated with flowers, colored paper and traditional foods, with the intention of counteracting mourning. In a number of areas, rituals based on Huasteca traditions are also performed. One of these is called the &quot;Danza de Xantolo&quot;, in which masked figures in robes dance in candlelight. In other communities, youths in costume will dance from house to house, to be invited in to eat dishes prepared for the occasion. Another tradition is to have bands play at the cemeteries on November 2, where tombs are cleaned and decorated with flowers, garlands and more.

==Native gastronomy==
The Mezquital Valley has best preserved the state&#x27;s indigenous (especially Otomi) culinary heritage based a number of traditional native animal and vegetable products. One of these is the use of a number of edible insects, many of which are considered delicacies such as escamoles (ant eggs) and maguey larvae as well as others such as larvae found on nopal plants, “chacas” (beetles) and “chicharras” (cicadas). Other local animals still used for food include tadpoles (called atepocates), salamanders and their larvae, squirrels and rabbits. Plant species still commonly used include mesquite beans, nopal and other cactus, and various cactus fruit such as “tunas” (cactus pears) and “xoconostle.” These are often prepared in dishes that the state shares with most of the rest of Mexico such as tacos, tamales, moles and a specialty of central Mexico, mixiote. Another common central Mexican dish popular in the state is barbacoa. This dish has its origins in the pre-Hispanic period, when it was meat cooked in an underground pit. Today, it is most often cooked in pots in more conventional ovens, but the meat, today mostly pork, is still smothered in the alcoholic beverage pulque and wrapped in maguey leaves for flavor. This preparation of barbacoa is considered to be the state dish.

==Tourism==

The state secretary of tourism has divided the state&#x27;s attraction into &quot;corridors&quot; with similar themes. The Corridor de la Montaña (Mountain Corridor) is devoted to ecotourism and includes a number of different climates and ecosystems. These areas favor activities such as camping, extreme sports and well as family activities. They include places such as old mining haciendas, archeological sites and state parks. Municipalities which are promoted under this category include Mineral del Monte, Huasca de Ocampo and Mineral del Chico.
The Corridor de los Balnearios (Water Park Corridor) list most of the major water parks, spas, natural pools and thermal springs in the state. Hidalgo ranks second in Mexico for the number of thermal springs. These springs have an average temperature of 38C but some reach as high as 80C. They exist due to rivers of magma that flow under the surface. Municipalities promoted under this category include Ixmiquilpan, Actopan and Cardonal.

The Corridor Tulancingo y los 4 elementos (Tulancingo and the 4 elements Corridor) is named for its major location of Tulancingo and the sports that are promoted here. Sporting activities are classed under the elements of air, water, fire and earth and include hot air ballooning, fishing, boating, rustic ironwork produced in Apulco and hiking in the natural landscapes. The area extends from the municipality of Tulancingo to the municipality of Huehuetla. (4 elementos)

The Corridor de las Haciendas (Haciendas Corridor) contains most of the state&#x27;s 176 former haciendas which were constructed between the 16th and the 19th centuries. Most were devoted to mining or the making of pulque. Many contain the original buildings, including the main residences as well as tours. Many of these are in rural municipalities, which conserve old traditions. In the Apan area, most of the old haciendas were devoted to the making of pulque, which is still made and can be sampled. The area also contains many of the state&#x27;s former colonial monasteries as well as civic constructions such as the Padre Tembleque Aqueduct.

The Sierra and Huasteca Corridor covers this mountain range which is home to the Huastec people. The area includes ecotourism activities, camping and fishing in an area filled with dense vegetations and heated water sources. Municipalities featured here include Huejutla de Reyes, Zacualtipán and Molango where many indigenous people live. The cuisine of the area is also emphasized.

The Tolteca Corridor centers on the archeological site of Tula, which was the home of one of the principal pre-Hispanic civilizations of Mexico. Many of the oldest monasteries of the state, founded in the 16th century, are located here. Hacienda Demiñho, which was once one of the most important and largest haciendas in the state, is located in this area. Featured municipalities include Tula de Allende, Atotonilco de Tula, Tepeji del Rio, Mixquiahuala, Tlahuelilpan, Tlaxcoapan and Tezontepec.


==Geography==
Main article: &quot;Geografía del Estado de Hidalgo&quot;.
The terrain of the state is very rugged. At its lowest point it is only a few meters above sea level, and at its highest it is over 3,300 meters above sea level.

The state is divided into three geographical regions: the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the Sierra Madre Oriental (mountain ranges), and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which contains the highest peaks. Each of these regions is distinct from the rest.

=== Mountains ===
The Sierra Alta region is part of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain system, and in the temperate climate zone of the state. Some of Hidalgo&#x27;s main peaks are located here, including Cerro del Aguila, Cerro del Santo Roa, and Cerrro de Agua Fria. There is also Cerro la Aguja de Calnali, a volcanic cinder cone. Many of Hidalgo&#x27;s caves are located here, such as Texcatete in Zacualtipan; Texcapa in Tepehuacán; and Tecamachal and Villacastla in Molango.

The Sierra Baja is also located in the Sierra Madre Oriental system and is characterized by small plains surrounded by stony peaks. There are five major canyons located here, which take their names from the rivers that form them, from south to north: Amajac, Meztitlan, Amolon, Mezquititlán and Tolantongo. Although lower than the temperate Sierra Alta, the Sierra Baja still has a temperate climate due to strong, moist winds which flow from the northeast.
The Sierra Gorda mountain range is a branch of the Sierra Madre Oriental which crosses northwest Hidalgo and ends in San Luis Potosí. These are mostly mountains of volcanic origin. The Tula and Moctezuma Rivers meet here, whose waters then cut the Moctezuma Canyon, which has walls up to 480 meters high.

The Sierra de Tenango or Sierra Norte de Puebla mountain range begins to one side of the Valley of Tulancingo and extends down to the Huasteca region of the states of Puebla and Veracruz. The range is also known as the Sierra de Huayacocotla, with low lying mountains of a humid, cloudy temperate climate with frequent rain in the summer. Two of Hidalgo&#x27;s main dams, the Tejocotal and the Omitemetl, are located on the rivers here, and are part of the Necaxa Hydroelectrical System.

La Comarca Minera is the mining district in the mountains around Pachuca and Real del Monte. Cerro de las Navajas is located here, a mountain made primarily of obsidian. The mining district and mountains extend from Pachuca north towards the municipality of Huasca, then east towards Actopan. From Pachuca it also extends a short ways south to Mineral de la Reforma and Comarca. In most of this region there is extensive mining, both of precious metals as well as lead and building stone, such as sandstone and marble. Over 38 million kilograms of silver and 200 tons of fine gold have been extracted since the Spanish colonial era began in the 16th century. That nearly equals the weight of the stone used to build the Tembleque Aqueduct. In additions to mines, the area is home to extensive forests of oyamel fir, pines. and oaks. Many of its peaks are rocky and barren such as Zumate in Omitlán, Peñas Cargadas in Real del Monte and Peña del Conejo in San Jerónimo.


=== Valleys ===
The Valley of Tulancingo has a temperate climate with an average year round temperature of 15C. It is bordered by the Sierra de Tenango and the highlands of Apan. It is a large fertile valley with extensive agriculture.

The very northern part of the Valley of Mexico is located within the state, which is separated from the area in which Mexico City is found by a series of low lying mountains. This part of the Valley extends from Tizayuca towards Pachuca. It is separated from the Valley of Mezquital by the Sierra de Tezontlalpan and from the rest of the Valley of Mexico by the low lying Sierra de los Pitos. The climate here is temperate and semi arid with occasional freezes. Except for the forests on the mountain tops, the flora and fauna are those found in more arid regions such as maguey, yucca, rabbits, armadillos and mesquite trees.

Since many of the mountains surrounding Pachuca lack tree cover, little slows the prevailing winds which can reach speeds of up to 120 km per hour. This gives the capital city the nickname of La Bella Airosa (Beautiful Windy City).

The Valley of Mezquital is three valleys called the Actopan, the Ixmiquilpan and the Tasquillo as well as flat areas known as Tula and Alfajayucan. The vegetation is mostly that of semi arid regions with mesquite trees and various types of cacti growing. The only areas with tree cover are those near streams and other water sources and on the mountain tops of the peaks. Despite this, the region is considered to be Hidalgo&#x27;s granary, growing corn, beans, wheat, tomatoes, onions, oats, olives, cactus fruit, tejocote and much more. It produces more than half of the alfalfa and green chili peppers in Mexico. Due to the lack of rainfall, irrigation from the areas above and below ground streams is important. However, it is also one of the areas of Mexico with the highest levels of malnutrition. The valley averages 2000 meters above sea level and has a temperate climate with freezes being rare.

=== Water ===
Principal rivers include the Tula, Amajac and the Metztitlan. Other rivers in the state flow into these three, such as the Rosas, Cuautitlan, Guadalupe and Salado, which flow into the Tula River. One exception to this is the San Juan River, which forms part of the state&#x27;s border with Querétaro. This river flows into the Pánuco River in San Luis Potosí. The Amajac begins in the Sierra de Pachuca and flows southeast. The Metztitlan River begins at the state&#x27;s border with Puebla state and eventually flows into Metztitlan Lake. Principal lakes in the state are the Metztitlán, Zupitlan or Tulancingo, San Antonio, Pueblilla and Carrillos. The state also has a significant number of sulfur and hot water springs such as La Cantera in Tula, Mixquiahual and Vito in Atotonilco, Tephé in Ejido Tephé, Humedades y Dios Padra in Ixmiquilpan and Tolantongo and Textacapa in Cardonal.

===Climate===
There are three main climates in the state. The lowlands are hot with temperatures rising as high as 44C in the summer in places such as the municipality of Pisaflores. Temperate regions can have hot days but often the temperature is moderated by cooler winds and clouds. Cold climates dominate the highest altitudes where freezing temperatures at night are not uncommon. Rainfall varies widely from as low as 250mm per year to as high as 2,800mm per year. The main indicator of climate type is altitude.

The north of the state has the lowest elevation and the hottest climate. It is also the smallest region of the state. The second region averages about 800 meters above sea level and is more temperate in climate. The coldest climates at the highest areas are the most populated and average about 2,000 meters above sea level.
Major elevations in the state include Cerro la Peñuela (3,350 masl), Cerro el Jihuingo (3,240masl), Cerro la Paila (3,200 masl), Cerro las Navajas (3,180 masl), Cerro el Agual Azul (3,040 masl) and Cerro la Estancia (3,020 masl).

In addition to the three main geographic/climate regions, the state subdivides into a number of sub-regions. Sub-regions include the La Huasteca area. This extends like a green sash across part of the state, and altitude does not exceed 800 masl. It is mostly located near the Gulf Coast and receives a significant amount of rainfall from this body of water.

==Ecology==
Most plants are either of arid and desert habitats, or of the Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests habitat, with Mexican pine (&quot;Pinus pseudostrobus&quot;) in the higher mountains.

Wildlife includes 31 species of reptiles, thirteen species of duck, six of doves, and three of falcons, as well as mammals such as skunks, spider monkeys, wild boar, anteaters, and gray foxes.

A small habitat in the state is the Huasteca highland rainforest. It has plants blooming nearly year-round. Forests include tree species such as: “Tlacuilo,” Oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; species), Copaifera, “Zuchiate,” Mahogany (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;), and Mexican white cedar (&quot;Cupressus lusitanica&quot;). The area has one of the widest varieties of wild birds including eagles, hummingbirds, and wild turkeys. Reptiles include a wide variety of snakes, and mammals include coyotes, bobcats, wild boar, spotted deer, and rabbits. Tropical crops raised here include sugar cane, coconuts, pineapple, bananas, mamey, and tamarind.


==Economy==

Traditionally, Hidalgo&#x27;s economy has been based on mining and agriculture, with manufacturing more recently. Most industry is located in what is called the “Urban Industrial Corridor of the South,&quot; where most of the state&#x27;s economic activity is located. Outside of this corridor, the economy remains based on subsistence farming and has high levels of poverty, with the per capita income only 61.5% of the national average. Industry accounts for more than 25% of the state&#x27;s gross domestic product.

However, the state has a higher-than-average growth, averaging 7.7% since the mid-1990s. The state consistently produces an overall surplus. Like other Mexican states, Hidalgo is heavily dependent on the federal government for revenues, with almost 97% of revenues from federal sources, which is high. The state&#x27;s debt level is very low compared to other rated local and regional governments in Mexico and worldwide. One major debt issue is with pension funds but S&amp;P does not consider it onerous. As of the end of 2000, the state&#x27;s economic rating by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s was ‘mxA-‘ with a stable outlook.
The state contains 2.1 million hectares of land, 30% of which is cultivable. Most of this land is only farmed during the annual rainy season. Corn is the primary crop followed by barley, beans, oats, wheat, green chili peppers, squash and tomatoes. Thirty-eight percent of the land is dedicated to grazing and livestock production. Fishing and fish farming are also important producing mojarra, tilapia, carp, trout and charal. Most of the surface area of the state (38%) is used for the raising of livestock with 29% dedicated to agriculture. Forests cover about 22% of the state. Both pine and broadleaf forests are found in the higher mountain areas of the state. The lower altitude Huasteca has rainforest and semi-rainforest vegetation. Hidalgo has approximately 125,000 m3 of commercial timber with an estimated value of 47,771.701 pesos. Non-wood forest products are estimated to value 331,961 pesos. For much of the 20th century, forest size diminished. This is being countered with reforestation efforts over as much as 743,224 hectares, with about 2,500 hectares fully reforested every year. Just over 25% of the population if employed in agriculture and livestock production.

Mining is the oldest and most traditional large-scale economic activity in the state. The mining of magnesium provides the most income to the state, providing 28% of all revenues, followed by zinc (18%), silver (14.3%), limestone (12.9%) and lead (7.7%). Other minerals include gold, copper, cadmium and sulfur. Most precious metals such as gold, silver and copper are mined in Pachuca and Zimapan. Petroleum, natural gas and other similar deposits also exist.

The most important commercial sector of the state is that of retail foodstuffs, especially those selling groceries, meat and poultry. This represented over 40% of the commercial sector in 1998. Just over 30% of commerce was dedicated to non-food products such as clothing and pharmaceuticals with the rest mostly dedicated to wholesale foods. From the latter 20th century, tourism has taken up much of the economic slack left behind by the demise of much of the state&#x27;s mining industry, with income from this sector surpassing that of the petroleum industry. The state has a variety of historic, cultural and natural attractions. Commerce and tourism employ about 44% of the population.

Industrial production in the state centers on metal products, machinery and equipment, accounting for about 24% of the total. Non-metallic minerals, other than petroleum account for about 25%. However, the most important industry is automobile and train engine production, which is followed by the refining of petroleum products, based mostly in Tula. Automotive and train production is centered in Ciudad Sahagún. Most of the automobiles produced are sold in Mexico City. Other industries include the production of cement in Tula de Allende and textiles in Tepeji del Río and Tulancingo. This employs about 30% of the population.

Construction accounts for about 4% of the economy of Hidalgo, with utilities such as electricity accounting for about the same. Hidalgo produces about 8.7% of the total electricity used in the country.

In many of the more rural parts of the state, the making of crafts such as textiles, baskets, wood items and more can contribute significantly to household income. Textile production is widespread, but some of the best embroidery is done in Tenango de Doria, in which blouses, skirts and more are covered in designs of bright colors. Another area with noted embroidery is Acaxochitlán and nearby communities in the Sierra de Huasteca. The designs on these pieces are endemic to the area. In the Mezquital Valley, they make items with maguey fiber, often for rope, belts, bags and sandals. The weaving of cotton and wool into items such as blankets, wraps and other items is also a widespread craft. Fibers from maguey plants and palm trees are also used in the production of baskets, hats and mats. One native hat made from palm fronds is called &quot;garambullero&quot; as well as a type of rattle. Other materials worked into baskets and other items include reeds, willow branches and ixtle. The working of all these fibres and materials is primarily done by women.

As the state has a relative abundance of wood, crafts based on this material is common. The most important product is the making of wood furniture, most of which is in a rustic Spanish style. Miniature boxes, flutes and other items are a speciality of a community called Nith in the Ixmiquuilpan municipality. Molango is noted for its guitars. Tenango is noted for the making of wooden utensils such as spoons and spatulas. Pottery production is categorized by the type of clay used. In the Tulancingo Valley, the clay type is known as &quot;chapopote&quot; and is mostly worked into pots, comals and other cooking items. Huejutla is known for its &quot;barro blanco&quot; (white clay), also used to make items for cooking. In Huasca de Ocampo red clay is abundant. In Chililico, the clay is ochre and typically painted with images of birds and flowers. The Mezquital Valley and the Comarca Minera area makes a type of pottery which is not glazed, mostly for utilitarian items. In some areas, such as Tulancingo and Chapantongo, Talavera type glazed pottery is also made. Metalworking comes from the state&#x27;s mining past, where materials such as gold, silver, copper and iron are worked into jewelry, pots, jars, utensils, and railing. Areas best known for their metal working are Pachuca and Real del Monte (jewelry), The Sierra Alta and Tizapán (copper items) and the Mezquital Valley for ironwork.

==Education==
In the 1999–2000 school year, the state had 7,421 educational centers for grades K-12, with 33,994 teachers and 743,771 students. Only 19.1% of these students are at the middle school level, 8.3% in vocational schools and 3% in preparatory or in higher education. Most of the students at the higher levels are concentrated in municipalities such as Pachuca, Tula de Allende, Huejutla, Ixmiquilpan and Tulancingo. Fifty-three percent of four-year-olds and 95% of five-year-olds attend pre school or kindergarten. Ninety-two percent of those who finish primary school go on to secondary school. Seventy-four percent who finish secondary school go on to high school or vocational school. Of children over six years of age, 93.5% are attending school, which is slightly above the national average of 92.2%, putting Hidalgo in 14th place.

The Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo began at the same time the state was founded. In 1869, the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios, the university&#x27;s predecessor was founded. It was reorganized in 1872 under the Porfirio Díaz regime and in 1875, the school was moved from the house it was founded in on Allende Street to the former hospital of San Juan de Dios on the west side of Pachuca. The school was closed several times during the Mexican Revolution but was permanently reopened in 1925 as the University of Hidalgo. From the time to the present the school has grown adding new departments such as those in medicine and engineering. In 1948, the school gain autonomy from governmental oversight, changing its name to the current one. This school is the most important in the state as it is organized in the mid-20th century to spur the industrial development on which the state depends today.

==Infrastructure==
In recent years Hidalgo has experienced an increase in its infrastructure. Telephone coverage is one per 15.3 inhabitants, and 100% of the population has access to radio and/or television broadcasts, both private and public. There are twelve licensed broadcasters in the state, equally divided between private and public organizations.

Newspapers of Hidalgo include &quot;El Independiente de Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;El Reloj de Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Tulancingo&quot;, &quot;Milenio Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;Ruta&quot;, &quot;Síntesis de Bolsillo Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;Síntesis, El Periódico de Hidalgo&quot;, &quot;Unomásuno Hidalgo&quot;, and &quot;Visto Bueno.&quot;

The state contains 7,923 km of highways, most of which (48.2%) are rural roads. Six cities, Pachuca, Huichapan, Molango, Ixmiquilpan, Tizayuca and Zimapan, have air travel facilities. The airport in Pachuca is the largest, with a 1,800 meter runway for both passengers and freight. An average of 4,500 flights enter and leave the facility each year. There are 978.5 km of rail lines with only 60 km in disuse.

<text>A solder ring fitting, also known by the trademarked name Yorkshire fitting, is a pre-soldered capillary connector for joining copper pipes used in plumbing.

==Operation==
To obtain functional joints, the inside of the fitting and the outside of the copper pipe are cleaned using steel wool or cleaning tape, flux paste is applied, the pipe is inserted into the fitting and heat is applied from a portable butane torch or propane torch until a ring of solder shows at the edges of the fitting. To obtain a durable joint, forced cooling should not be used. Yorkshire fittings are made with lead-free solder.

The fittings come in a variety of configurations, such as tee-pieces, straight couplers, elbows or bends, reducers (to join pipes of different diameters), stop-ends, and there are versions with screw threads (male or female) at one end to fit taps and iron pipes.

Valves such as stoptaps &amp; gate valves are also available in solder ring configuration.

<text>Trail mix is a type of snack mix, typically a combination of granola, dried fruit, nuts, and sometimes candy, developed as food to be taken along on hikes. Trail mix is a popular snack food for hikes, because it is lightweight, easy to store, and nutritious, providing a quick energy boost from the carbohydrates in the dried fruit or granola, and sustained energy from fatty nuts.

The combination of fat nuts, raisins and chocolate as a trail snack, dates at least to the 1910s, when outdoorsman Horace Kephart recommended it in his popular camping guide &quot;Camping and Woodcraft&quot;.

==Other names==
In New Zealand, trail mix is known as scroggin or schmogle. In Australia, the term &quot;scroggin&quot; is used almost exclusively, although in more recent years, &quot;trail mix&quot; has been imported into the jargon from the US. Some claim that the name stands for sultanas, carob, raisins, orange peel, grains, glucose, and nuts or alternatively sultanas, chocolate, raisins and other goodies including nuts; but this may be a backronym.

The American term gorp is often used by campers and hikers in North America. Some claim it&#x27;s an acronym for &quot;good ol&#x27; raisins and peanuts.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites a 1913 reference to the verb &quot;gorp,&quot; meaning &quot;to eat greedily,&quot; so the acronym may be a backronym.

In Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and several other European countries, trail mix is called student fodder, student oats or student mix in the local languages. It usually does not include chocolate.

<text>xUnit is a label used for an automated testing software framework that shares significant structure and functionality that is traceable to a common progenitor SUnit.

The SUnit framework was ported to Java by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma as JUnit which gained wide popularity. Adaptations to other languages were also popular which led some to claim that the structured, object-oriented style works well with popular languages including Java and C#. 

The name of an adaptation is often a variation of &quot;SUnit&quot; with the &quot;S&quot; replaced with an abbreviation of the target language name. For example, JUnit for Java and RUnit for R. The term &quot;xUnit&quot; refers to any such adaptation where &quot;x&quot; is a placeholder for the language-specific prefix.

The xUnit frameworks are often used for unit testing testing an isolated unit of code but can be used for any level of software testing including integration and system.

== Architecture ==

An xUnit framework has the following general architecture.

=== Test case ===

A test case is the smallest part of a test that generally encodes a simple path through the software under test. The test case code prepares input data and environmental state, invokes the software under test and verifies expected results.

A programmer writes the code for each test case.

=== Assertions ===

A test case is implemented with one or more assertions that validate expected results. 

Generally, the framework provides assertion functionality. A framework may provide a way to use custom assertions.

=== Test suite ===

A test suite is a collection of related test cases. They share a framework which allows for reuse of environment setup and cleanup code.

Generally, a test runner may run the cases of a suite in any order so the programmer should not depend on top-to-bottom execution order.

=== Test fixture ===

A test fixture (also known as a test context) provides the environment for each test case of a suite. Generally, a fixture is configured to setup a known, good, runtime environment before tests run, and to cleanup the environment after.

The fixture is configured with one or more functions that setup and cleanup state. The test runner runs each setup function before each case and runs each cleanup function after.

=== Test runner ===

A test runner is a program that runs tests and reports results. The program is often part of a framework.

A test runner may produce results in various formats. Often, a common and default format is human-readable, plain-text. Additionally, the runner may produce structured output. Some xUnit adaptations (i.e. JUnit) can output XML that can be used by a continuous integration system such as Jenkins and Atlassian Bamboo.

<text>The Amiga 3000UX is a model of the Amiga computer family that was released with Amiga Unix, a full port of AT&amp;T Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4), installed along with AmigaOS. The system is otherwise equivalent to the standard A3000, once a right-click initiates a boot to Kickstart (Amiga&#x27;s kernel).

Sun Microsystems and Unix International featured the Amiga 3000UX on their stands at the 1991 Uniforum event, ostensibly to promote Commodore&#x27;s adoption of those exhibitors&#x27; technologies, specifically OPEN LOOK and SVR4. This may have led to unsubstantiated rumours about Sun potentially incorporating the model into its workstation range, sustained by persistent community perceptions of Commodore&#x27;s managerial incompetence.

It is possible that Commodore (or a third party) repurposed A3000UX machines for standard AmigaOS, as some standard A3000 models have been found with labeling suggesting they were originally to be sold as A3000UX machines.

<doc id="224034" wikidata="Q1656447" url="?curid=224034" title="Tarpit (networking)">
<text>A tarpit is a service on a computer system (usually a server) that purposely delays incoming connections. The technique was developed as a defense against a computer worm, and the idea is that network abuses such as spamming or broad scanning are less effective, and therefore less attractive, if they take too long. The concept is analogous with a tar pit, in which animals can get bogged down and slowly sink under the surface, like in a swamp.

==The original tarpit idea==

Tom Liston developed the original tarpitting program &quot;LaBrea&quot;. It can protect an entire network with a tarpit run on a single machine.

The machine listens for Address Resolution Protocol requests that go unanswered (indicating unused addresses), then replies to those requests, receives the initial SYN packet of the scanner and sends a SYN/ACK in response. It does not open a socket or prepare a connection, in fact it can forget all about the connection after sending the SYN/ACK. However, the remote site sends its ACK (which gets ignored) and believes the 3-way-handshake to be complete. Then it starts to send data, which never reaches a destination. The connection will time out after a while, but since the system believes it is dealing with a live (established) connection, it is conservative in timing it out and will instead try to retransmit, back-off, retransmit, etc. for quite a while.

Later versions of LaBrea also added functionality to reply to the incoming data, again using raw IP packets and no sockets or other resources of the tarpit server, with bogus packets that request that the sending site &quot;slow down&quot;. This will keep the connection established and waste even more time of the scanner.

==SMTP tarpits==
One of the possible avenues that were considered to battle bulk-spam at one time, was to mandate a small fee for every submitted mail. By introducing such artificial cost, with negligible impact on legitimate use as long as the fee is small enough, automated mass-scale spam would instantly become unattractive. Tarpitting could be seen as a similar (but technically much less complex) approach, where the cost for the spammer would be measured in terms of time and efficiency rather than money.

Authentication procedures increase response times as users attempt invalid passwords. SMTP authentication is no exception. However, server-to-server SMTP transfers, which is where spam is injected, require no authentication. Various methods have been discussed and implemented for SMTP tarpits, systems that plug into the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA, i.e. the mail server software) or sit in front of it as a proxy.

One method increases transfer time for all mails by a few seconds by delaying the initial greeting message (&quot;greet delay&quot;). The idea is that it will not matter if a legitimate mail takes a little longer to deliver, but due to the high volume, it will make a difference for spammers. The downside of this is that mailing lists and other legitimate mass-mailings will have to be explicitly whitelisted or they will suffer, too.

Some email systems, such as sendmail 8.13+, implement a stronger form of greet delay. This form pauses when the connection is first established and listens for traffic. If it detects any traffic prior to its own greeting (in violation of RFC 2821) it closes the connection. Since many spammers do not write their SMTP implementations to the specification, this can reduce the number of incoming spam messages.

Another method is to delay only known spammers, e.g. by using a blacklist (see Spamming, DNSBL). OpenBSD has integrated this method into their core system since OpenBSD 3.3, with a special-purpose daemon (spamd) and functionality in the firewall (pf) to redirect known spammers to this tarpit.

MS Exchange can tarpit senders who send to an invalid address. Exchange can do this because the SMTP connector is connected to the authentication system.

A more subtle idea is greylisting, which, in simple terms, rejects the first connection attempt from any previously unseen IP address. The assumption is that most spammers make only one connection attempt (or a few attempts over a short period of time) to send each message, whereas legitimate mail delivery systems will keep retrying over a longer period. After they retry, they will eventually be allowed in without any further impediments.

Finally, a more elaborate method tries to glue tarpits and filtering software together, by filtering e-mail in realtime, while it is being transmitted, and adding delays to the communication in response to the filter&#x27;s &quot;spam likeliness&quot; indicator. For example, the spam filter would make a &quot;guess&quot; after each line or after every x bytes received as to how likely this message is going to be spam. The more likely this is, the more the MTA will delay the transmission.

===Background===
SMTP consists of requests, which are mostly four-letter words such as MAIL, and replies, which are (minimally) three-digit numbers. In the last line of the reply, the number is followed by a space; in the preceding lines it is followed by a hyphen. Thus, on determining that a message being attempted to send is spam, a mail server can reply:

 451-Ophiomyia prima is an agromyzid fly
 451-Ophiomyia secunda is an agromyzid fly
 451-Ophiomyia tertia is an agromyzid fly
 451-Ophiomyia quarta is an agromyzid fly
 451-Ophiomyia quinta is an agromyzid fly
 451-Ophiomyia sexta is an agromyzid fly
 451-Ophiomyia septima is an agromyzid fly
 451 Your IP address is listed in the DNSBL. Please try again later.

The tarpit waits fifteen or more seconds between lines (long delays are allowed in SMTP, as humans sometimes send mail manually to test mail servers). This ties up the SMTP sending process on the spammer&#x27;s computer so as to limit the amount of spam it can send.

==IP-level tarpits==

The Linux kernel can now be patched to allow tarpitting of incoming connections instead of the more usual dropping of packets. This is implemented in iptables by the addition of a TARPIT target. The same packet inspection and matching features can be applied to tarpit targets as are applied to other targets.

==Mixed SMTP-IP level tarpits==

A server can determine that a given mail message is spam, e.g. because it was addressed to a spam trap, or after trusted users&#x27; reports. The server may decide that the IP address responsible for submitting the message deserves tarpitting. Cross-checking against available DNSBLs can help to avoid including innocent forwarders in the tarpit database. A daemon exploiting Linux libipq can then check the remote address of incoming SMTP connections against that database. SpamCannibal is a GPL software designed around this idea; Stockade is a similar project implemented using FreeBSD ipfirewall.

One advantage of tarpitting at the IP level is that regular TCP connections handled by an MTA are &quot;stateful&quot;. That is, although the MTA doesn&#x27;t use much CPU while it sleeps, it still uses the amount of memory required to hold the state of each connection. On the opposite, LaBrea-style tarpitting is &quot;stateless&quot;, thus gaining the advantage of a reduced cost against the spammer&#x27;s box. However, making use of botnets, spammers can externalize most of their computer-resource costs.

==Criticism==

It is known that a tarpitted connection may generate a significant amount of traffic towards the receiver, because the sender considers the connection as established and tries to send (and then retransmit) actual data. In practice, given current average computer botnet size, a more reasonable solution will be to drop suspicious traffic completely, without tarpitting. This way, only TCP SYN segments will be retransmitted, not the whole HTTP or HTTPS requests.

==Commercial implementations of tar-pitting==

As well as MS Exchange, there have been two other successful commercial implementations of the tar pit idea. The first was developed by TurnTide, a Philadelphia-based startup company, which was acquired by Symantec in 2004 for $28 million in cash. The TurnTide Anti Spam Router contains a modified Linux kernel which allows it to play various tricks with TCP traffic, such as varying the TCP window size. By grouping various email senders into different traffic classes and limiting the bandwidth for each class, the amount of abusive traffic is reduced - particularly when the abusive traffic is coming from single sources which are easily identified by their high traffic volume.

After the Symantec acquisition, a Canadian startup company called MailChannels released their &quot;Traffic Control&quot; software, which uses a slightly different approach to achieve similar results. Traffic Control is a semi-realtime SMTP proxy. Unlike the TurnTide appliance, which applies traffic shaping at the network layer, Traffic Control applies traffic shaping to individual senders at the application layer. This approach results in a somewhat more effective handling of spam traffic originating from botnets because it allows the software to slow traffic from individual spam zombies, rather than requiring zombie traffic to be aggregated into a class.

<text>The Cook&#x27;s Decameron: A Study In Taste, Containing Over Two Hundred Recipes For Italian Dishes is a cookbook by Emily Waters (as Mrs. W. G. Waters) first published in 1901.

Introduced in the form of a story inspired by Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (for which it is named), the book introduces the fictional Marchesa di Sant Andrea who learns that nine aristocratic friends have all been forced to postpone much anticipated dinner parties as their cooks have all resigned. That evening, the Marchesa and her friends meet and make plans to establish a cooking school under the Marchesa&#x27;s direction. Following the introductory fiction, the form reverts to a more conventional cookbook, and Waters presents more than 200 recipes for Italian dishes.

The book was initially published in 1901 in London (William Heineman) and New York (Brentano). It was successful enough to be reprinted and in 1920 Waters published a sequel, &quot;Just a Cookery Book&quot;, published by the Medici Society and containing 400 recipes.

Waters, who died in 1928, was also a skilled classicist and collaborated with her husband, William George Waters, in translating Italian Renaissance literature.
