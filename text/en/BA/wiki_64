<text>Marginalism is a theory of economics that attempts to explain the discrepancy in the value of goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. It states that the reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while the water has greater total utility, the diamond has greater marginal utility.

Although the central concept of marginalism is that of marginal utility, marginalists, following the lead of Alfred Marshall, drew upon the idea of marginal physical productivity in explanation of cost. The neoclassical tradition that emerged from British marginalism abandoned the concept of utility and gave marginal rates of substitution a more fundamental role in analysis. Marginalism is an integral part of mainstream economic theory.

== Main concepts ==
=== Marginality ===
For issues of marginality, constraints are conceptualized as a &quot;border&quot; or &quot;margin&quot;. The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her &quot;endowment&quot;, broadly conceived to include opportunities. This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a &quot;marginal&quot; value. A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a &quot;marginal&quot; change.

Neoclassical economics usually assumes that marginal changes are infinitesimals or limits. Although this assumption makes the analysis less robust, it increases tractability. One is therefore often told that &quot;marginal&quot; is synonymous with &quot;very small&quot;, though in more general analysis this may not be operationally true and would not in any case be literally true. Frequently, economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a resource, because decisions are often made in terms of units; marginalism seeks to explain unit prices in terms of such marginal values.

=== Marginal use ===

The marginal use of a good or service is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.

Marginalism assumes, for any given agent, economic rationality and an ordering of possible states-of-the-world, such that, for any given set of constraints, there is an attainable state which is best in the eyes of that agent. Descriptive marginalism asserts that choice amongst the specific means by which various anticipated specific states-of-the-world (outcomes) might be affected is governed only by the distinctions amongst those specific outcomes; prescriptive marginalism asserts that such choice &quot;ought&quot; to be so governed.

On such assumptions, each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.

=== Marginal utility ===

The marginal utility of a good or service is the utility of its marginal use. Under the assumption of economic rationality, it is the utility of its least urgent possible use &quot;from&quot; the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included.

In 20th century mainstream economics, the term &quot;utility&quot; has come to be formally defined as a &quot;quantification&quot; capturing preferences by assigning greater quantities to states, goods, services, or applications that are of higher priority. But marginalism and the concept of marginal utility predate the establishment of this convention within economics. The more general conception of utility is that of &quot;use&quot; or &quot;usefulness&quot;, and this conception is at the heart of marginalism; the term &quot;marginal utility&quot; arose from translation of the German &quot;Grenznutzen&quot;, which literally means &quot;border use&quot;, referring directly to the marginal use, and the more general formulations of marginal utility do not treat quantification as an &quot;essential&quot; feature. On the other hand, none of the early marginalists insisted that utility were &quot;not&quot; quantified, some indeed treated quantification as an essential feature, and those who did not still used an assumption of quantification for expository purposes. In this context, it is not surprising to find many presentations that fail to recognize a more general approach.

==== Quantified marginal utility ====
Under the special case in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state formula_1 to state formula_2 is
:formula_3
Moreover, if formula_1 and formula_2 are distinguishable by values of just one variable formula_6 which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in formula_6 to the size of that change:
:formula_8
(where &quot;c.p.&quot; indicates that the &quot;only&quot; independent variable to change is formula_6).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that
:formula_10
is well defined, and use &quot;marginal utility&quot; to refer to a partial derivative
:formula_11

==== Law of diminishing marginal utility ====
The law of diminishing marginal utility, also known as a Gossen&#x27;s First Law, is that &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, as additional amounts of a good or service are added to available resources, their marginal utilities are decreasing. This law is sometimes treated as a tautology, sometimes as something proven by introspection, or sometimes as a mere instrumental assumption, adopted only for its perceived predictive efficacy. It is not quite any of these things, although it may have aspects of each. The law does not hold under all circumstances, so it is neither a tautology nor otherwise proveable; but it has a basis in prior observation.

An individual will typically be able to partially order the potential uses of a good or service. If there is scarcity, then a rational agent will satisfy wants of highest possible priority, so that no want is avoidably sacrificed to satisfy a want of &quot;lower&quot; priority. In the absence of complementarity across the uses, this will imply that the priority of use of any additional amount will be lower than the priority of the established uses, as in this famous example:
:A pioneer farmer had five sacks of grain, with no way of selling them or buying more. He had five possible uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots to amuse him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words they were on the margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.

However, if there &quot;is&quot; a complementarity across uses, then an amount added can bring things past a desired tipping point, or an amount subtracted cause them to fall short. In such cases, the marginal utility of a good or service might actually be &quot;increasing&quot;.

Without the presumption that utility is quantified, the &quot;diminishing&quot; of utility should not be taken to be itself an arithmetic subtraction. It is the movement from use of higher to lower priority, and may be no more than a purely ordinal change.

When quantification of utility is assumed, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to a utility function whose &quot;slope&quot; is continually or continuously decreasing. In the latter case, if the function is also smooth, then the law may be expressed as
:formula_12
Neoclassical economics usually supplements or supplants discussion of marginal utility with indifference curves, which were originally derived as the level curves of utility functions, or can be produced without presumption of quantification, but are often simply treated as axiomatic. In the absence of complementarity of goods or services, diminishing marginal utility implies convexity of indifference curves, although such convexity would also follow from quasiconcavity of the utility function.

=== Marginal rate of substitution ===

The &quot;rate of substitution&quot; is the &quot;least favorable&quot; rate at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another. The &quot;marginal&quot; rate of substitution (MRS) is the rate of substitution at the margin; in other words, given some constraint.

When goods and services are discrete, the least favorable rate at which an agent would trade A for B will usually be different from that at which she would trade B for A:
:formula_13

When the goods and services are continuously divisible in the limiting case
:formula_14
and the marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the indifference curve (multiplied by formula_15).

If, for example, Lisa will not trade a goat for anything less than two sheep, then her
:formula_16

If she will not trade a sheep for anything less than two goats, then her
:formula_17

However, if she would trade one gram of banana for one ounce of ice cream &quot;and vice versa&quot;, then
:formula_18

When indifference curves (which are essentially graphs of instantaneous rates of substitution) and the convexity of those curves are not taken as given, the &quot;law&quot; of diminishing marginal utility is invoked to explain diminishing marginal rates of substitution – a willingness to accept fewer units of good or service formula_19 in substitution for formula_20 as one&#x27;s holdings of formula_19 grow relative to those of formula_20. If an individual has a stock or flow of a good or service whose marginal utility is less than would be that of some other good or service for which he or she could trade, then it is in his or her interest to effect that trade. As one thing is traded-away and another is acquired, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades are now changed. On the assumption that the marginal utility of one is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant. If any trader can better his or her own marginal position by offering an exchange more favorable to other traders with desired goods or services, then he or she will do so.

=== Marginal cost ===

At the highest level of generality, a marginal cost is a marginal opportunity cost. In most contexts, marginal cost refers to marginal &quot;pecuniary&quot; cost, that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

A thorough-going marginalism sees marginal cost as increasing under the law of diminishing marginal utility, because applying resources to one application reduces their availability to other applications. Neoclassical economics tends to disregard this argument, but to see marginal costs as increasing in consequence of diminishing returns.

== Application to price theory ==

Marginalism and neoclassical economics typically explain price formation broadly through the interaction of curves or schedules of supply and demand. In any case buyers are modelled as pursuing typically lower quantities, and sellers offering typically higher quantities, as price is increased, with each being willing to trade until the marginal value of what they would trade-away exceeds that of the thing for which they would trade.

=== Demand ===
Demand curves are explained by marginalism in terms of marginal rates of substitution.

At any given price, a prospective buyer has some marginal rate of substitution of money for the good or service in question. Given the &quot;law&quot; of diminishing marginal utility, or otherwise given convex indifference curves, the rates are such that the willingness to forgo money for the good or service decreases as the buyer would have ever more of the good or service and ever less money. Hence, any given buyer has a demand schedule that generally decreases in response to price (at least until quantity demanded reaches zero). The aggregate quantity demanded by all buyers is, at any given price, just the sum of the quantities demanded by individual buyers, so it too decreases as price increases.

=== Supply ===
Both neoclassical economics and thorough-going marginalism could be said to explain supply curves in terms of marginal cost; however, there are marked differences in conceptions of that cost.

Marginalists in the tradition of Marshall and neoclassical economists tend to represent the supply curve for any producer as a curve of marginal pecuniary costs objectively determined by physical processes, with an upward slope determined by diminishing returns.

A more thorough-going marginalism represents the supply curve as a &quot;complementary demand curve&quot; – where the demand is &quot;for&quot; money and the purchase is made &quot;with&quot; a good or service. The shape of that curve is then determined by marginal rates of substitution of money for that good or service.

=== Markets ===
By confining themselves to limiting cases in which sellers or buyers are both &quot;price takers&quot; – so that demand functions ignore supply functions or &quot;vice versa&quot; – Marshallian marginalists and neoclassical economists produced tractable models of &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; competition and of various forms of &quot;imperfect&quot; competition, which models are usually captured by relatively simple graphs. Other marginalists have sought to present what they thought of as more realistic explanations, but this work has been relatively uninfluential on the mainstream of economic thought.

=== Paradox of water and diamonds ===

The law of diminishing marginal utility is said to explain the paradox of water and diamonds, most commonly associated with Adam Smith, although it was recognized by earlier thinkers. Human beings cannot even survive without water, whereas diamonds, in Smith&#x27;s day, were ornamentation or engraving bits. Yet water had a very small price, and diamonds a very large price. Marginalists explained that it is the &quot;marginal&quot; usefulness of any given quantity that matters, rather than the usefulness of a &quot;class&quot; or of a &quot;totality&quot;. For most people, water was sufficiently abundant that the loss or gain of a gallon would withdraw or add only some very minor use if any, whereas diamonds were in much more restricted supply, so that the loss or gain was much greater.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== History ==
=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, wherein he writes 

There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle&#x27;s&#x27; value theory.

A great variety of economists concluded that there was &quot;some&quot; sort of inter-relationship between utility and rarity that effected economic decisions, and in turn informed the determination of prices.

Eighteenth-century Italian mercantilists, such as Antonio Genovesi, Giammaria Ortes, Pietro Verri, Cesare Beccaria, and Giovanni Rinaldo, held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted. In &quot;Della Moneta&quot; (1751), Abbé Ferdinando Galiani, a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;scarcity&quot;, with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.

Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, in &quot;Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse&quot; (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantilists, Étienne Bonnot de Condillac saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belongs, and by estimated scarcity. In &quot;De commerce et le gouvernement&quot; (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the 19th-century proto-marginalist Richard Whately, who wrote as follows in &quot;Introductory Lectures on Political Economy&quot; (1832): 

Whately&#x27;s student Nassau William Senior is noted below as an early marginalist.

Frédéric Bastiat in chapters V and XI of his &quot;Economic Harmonies&quot; (1850) also develops a theory of value as ratio between services that increment utility, rather than between total utility.

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by Daniel Bernoulli, in &quot;Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis&quot;. This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732. In 1728, Gabriel Cramer produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter. Each had sought to resolve the St. Petersburg paradox, and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the natural logarithm (Bernoulli) or square root (Cramer) thereof. However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In &quot;A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange&quot;, delivered in 1833 and included in &quot;Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent&quot; (1837), William Forster Lloyd explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications. The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.

In &quot;An Outline of the Science of Political Economy&quot; (1836), Nassau William Senior asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.

In &quot;De la mesure de l&#x27;utilité des travaux publics&quot; (1844), Jules Dupuit applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.

In 1854, Hermann Heinrich Gossen published &quot;Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln&quot;, which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy. However, Gossen&#x27;s work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism as a formal theory can be attributed to the work of three economists, Jevons in England, Menger in Austria, and Walras in Switzerland. William Stanley Jevons first proposed the theory in an article in 1862 and a book in 1871. Similarly, Carl Menger presented the theory in 1871. Menger explained why individuals use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs, but while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not. Léon Walras introduced the theory in &quot;Éléments d&#x27;économie politique pure&quot;, the first part of which was published in 1874. The American John Bates Clark is also associated with the origins of Marginalism, but did little to advance the theory. This new way of thinking was a very drastic shift in thinking from the classical school of economics, founded in part by Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. The classical school of economics believed in a concept called the labor theory of value which emphasized the idea that the amount of time it took to produce a good determined the value of that good. This concept&#x27;s rival, marginal utility on the other hand, focused on the value that the consumer received from the good when determining its value. What the marginalists understood was that the exchange value of goods can be used to describe the use value of goods. Meghnad Desai puts it this way, &quot;Individuals in their daily activity so managed their resources that they balanced the marginal utility - the utility (use value) derived from an extra unit of a commodity they consumed - with the price (exchange value) they paid for it&quot;. Thus, when consumption of a good goes up, the utility of that good decreases as it is consumed. Each person would continue to consume until the marginal utility would be equal to the price. Jevons also wanted to formulate a price theory that accounted for this marginal utility and discovered the following: cost production determines supply; supply determines final degree of utility; and final degree of utility determines value. Walras was able to articulate the utility maximization of the consumer far better than Jevons and Menger by assuming that utility was linked to the consumption of each good.

==== Second generation ====

Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists. In England, the second generation were exemplified by Philip Wicksteed, by William Smart, and by Alfred Marshall; in Austria by Eugen Böhm von Bawerk and by Friedrich von Wieser; in Switzerland by Vilfredo Pareto; and in America by Herbert Joseph Davenport and by Frank A. Fetter.

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines. The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras. Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger. Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of &quot;the American Psychological School&quot;, named in imitation of the Austrian &quot;Psychological School&quot;. Clark&#x27;s work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger. William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger&#x27;s conception. He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing marginal productivity of time and with time preference. (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by Knut Wicksell and with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference by Wicksell&#x27;s American rival Irving Fisher.)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, the first volume of which was published in 1890. Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant, or nearly so. Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he paired a marginal explanation of demand with a more classical explanation of supply, wherein costs were taken to be objectively determined. Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.

==== Marginal Revolution as a response to socialism ====
The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as a response to the rise of the worker&#x27;s movement, Marxian economics and the earlier (Ricardian) socialist theories of the exploitation of labour. The first volume of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; was not published until July 1867, when marginalism was already developing, but before the advent of Marxian economics, proto-marginalist ideas such as those of Gossen had largely fallen on deaf ears. It was only in the 1880s, when Marxism had come to the fore as the main economic theory of the workers&#x27; movement, that Gossen found (posthumous) recognition.

Aside from the rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a different &#x27;external&#x27; reason for marginalism&#x27;s success, which is its successful response to the Long Depression and the resurgence of class conflict in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848–1870 period of social peace. Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory of the free market as perfect, as performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers&#x27; coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.

Scholars have suggested that the success of the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution was their ability to formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, &quot;&quot; (1896), but the first was Wicksteed&#x27;s &quot;The Marxian Theory of Value. &quot;Das Kapital&quot;: A Criticism&quot; (1884, followed by &quot;The Jevonian Criticism of Marx: A Rejoinder&quot; in 1885). The most famous early Marxist responses were Rudolf Hilferding&#x27;s (1904) and &quot;The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1914) by Nikolai Bukharin.

=== Eclipse ===
In his 1881 work &quot;Mathematical Psychics&quot;, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth presented the indifference curve, deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. But it came to be seen that indifference curves could be considered as somehow &quot;given&quot;, without bothering with notions of utility.

In 1915, Eugen Slutsky derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves. Because of the World War, the Bolshevik Revolution, and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky&#x27;s work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by John Hicks and R. G. D. Allen derived much the same results and found a significant audience. Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky&#x27;s earlier accomplishment.

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility, most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way of dispensing with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a &quot;rabbit out of a hat&quot;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that marginal utility analysis had been superseded by indifference curve analysis, the former became at best somewhat analogous to the Bohr model of the atom—perhaps pedagogically useful, but &quot;old fashioned&quot; and ultimately incorrect.

=== Revival ===
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address a paradox of gambling, rather than the paradox of value. The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither risk nor uncertainty. So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The expected utility hypothesis of Bernoulli &quot;et alii&quot; was revived by various 20th century thinkers, including Frank Ramsey (1926), John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944), and Leonard Savage (1954). Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not merely utility but a quantified conception thereof back into the mainstream of economic thought, and would dispatch the Ockhamistic argument. It should perhaps be noted that in expected utility analysis the law of diminishing marginal utility corresponds to what is called risk aversion.

== Criticism==

=== Marxist criticism of marginalism ===

Karl Marx died before marginalism became the interpretation of economic value accepted by mainstream economics. His theory was based on the labor theory of value, which distinguishes between exchange value and use value. In his &quot;Capital&quot;, he rejected the explanation of long-term market values by supply and demand:
:Nothing is easier than to realize the inconsistencies of demand and supply, and the resulting deviation of market-prices from market-values. The real difficulty consists in determining what is meant by the equation of supply and demand.
:If supply equals demand, they cease to act, and for this very reason commodities are sold at their market-values. Whenever two forces operate equally in opposite directions, they balance one another, exert no outside influence, and any phenomena taking place in these circumstances must be explained by causes other than the effect of these two forces. If supply and demand balance one another, they cease to explain anything, do not affect market-values, and therefore leave us so much more in the dark about the reasons why the market-value is expressed in just this sum of money and no other.

In his early response to marginalism, Nikolai Bukharin argued that &quot;the subjective evaluation from which price is to be derived really starts from this price&quot;, concluding:

:Whenever the Böhm-Bawerk theory, it appears, resorts to individual motives as a basis for the derivation of social phenomena, he is actually smuggling in the social content in a more or less disguised form in advance, so that the entire construction becomes a vicious circle, a continuous logical fallacy, a fallacy that can serve only specious ends, and demonstrating in reality nothing more than the complete barrenness of modern bourgeois theory.

Similarly a later Marxist critic, Ernest Mandel, argued that marginalism was &quot;divorced from reality&quot;, ignored the role of production, further arguing:
:It is, moreover, unable to explain how, from the clash of millions of different individual &quot;needs&quot; there emerge not only uniform prices, but prices which remain stable over long periods, even under perfect conditions of free competition. Rather than an explanation of constants, and of the basic evolution of economic life, the &quot;marginal&quot; technique provides at best an explanation of ephemeral, short-term variations.

Maurice Dobb argued that prices derived through marginalism depend on the distribution of income. The ability of consumers to express their preferences is dependent on their spending power. As the theory asserts that prices arise in the act of exchange, Dobb argues that it cannot explain how the distribution of income affects prices and consequently cannot explain prices.

Dobb also criticized the &quot;motives&quot; behind marginal utility theory. Jevons wrote, for example, &quot;so far as is consistent with the inequality of wealth in every community, all commodities are distributed by exchange so as to produce the maximum social benefit.&quot; (See Fundamental theorems of welfare economics.) Dobb contended that this statement indicated that marginalism is intended to insulate market economics from criticism by making prices the natural result of the given income distribution.

=== Marxist adaptations to marginalism ===
Some economists strongly influenced by the Marxian tradition such as Oskar Lange, Włodzimierz Brus, and Michał Kalecki have attempted to integrate it with the insights of classical political economy, marginalism, and neoclassical economics. They believed that Marx lacked a sophisticated theory of prices, and neoclassical economics lacked a theory of the social frameworks of economic activity. Some other Marxists have also argued that on one level there is no conflict between marginalism and Marxism as one could employ a marginalist theory of supply and demand within the context of a big picture understanding of the Marxist notion that capitalists exploit surplus labor.

<text>Rodney George Laver (born 9 August 1938) is an Australian former professional tennis player. Laver was ranked as the world number 1 professional player indisputably for five years from 1965 to 1969, and by some sources also in 1964 and 1970. He was also ranked as the number 1 amateur in 1961 and 1962. Laver won 200 singles titles across his amateur and professional careers, the most won by any tennis player.

Laver won 11 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and 8 Pro major titles. He completed the Grand Slam (winning all four majors in a calendar year) in singles twice, in 1962 and 1969; the latter remains the only time a man has done so in the Open Era. He also completed the Pro Slam (winning all three pro majors in one year) in 1967. Laver won titles on all court surfaces of his time (grass, clay, hard, carpet, wood), and he contributed to five Davis Cup titles for Australiaduring a time when the Davis Cup was deemed as significant as the four majors. The Rod Laver Arena (the main show court of the Australian Open) and the Laver Cup tournament are named after him.

==Early life==
Rodney George Laver was born in Rockhampton, Australia, on 9 August 1938. He was the third of four children of Roy Laver, a cattleman and butcher, and his wife Melba Roffey.

Amongst his relatives were the cricketers Frank Laver and Jack Laver.

== Career ==
=== Amateur (1956–62) ===
Laver was a teenager when he left school to pursue a tennis career that lasted 24 years. He was coached in Queensland by Charlie Hollis and later by the Australian Davis Cup team captain Harry Hopman, who gave Laver the nickname &quot;Rocket&quot;.

Laver was both Australian and US Junior champion in 1957. He had his breakthrough on the world stage in 1959, when he reached all three finals at Wimbledon, winning the mixed doubles title with Darlene Hard. As an unseeded player, he lost the singles final to Peruvian Alex Olmedo after surviving an 87-game semifinal against American Barry MacKay (tennis). His first major singles title was the Australian Championships in 1960, where he defeated fellow Australian Neale Fraser in a five-set final after coming back from two sets down and saving a Fraser championship point in the fourth set. Laver captured his first Wimbledon singles crown in 1961 beating Chuck McKinley in straight sets in the final, which lasted just 53 minutes (one of the shortest men&#x27;s singles Wimbledon finals on record). Laver was ranked the world No. 1 amateur in 1961 by Lance Tingay.
In 1962, Laver became the first male player since Don Budge in 1938 to win all four Grand Slam singles titles in the same year. He won an additional 18 titles, for a season total of 22. Among those titles were the Italian Championships and the German Championships, giving Laver the &quot;clay court triple&quot; of Paris, Rome, and Hamburg that had been achieved previously only by Lew Hoad in 1956. At the Australian championships, Laver beat Roy Emerson in the final. The biggest hurdle to Laver&#x27;s winning the Grand Slam was the French Championships on slow clay, where Laver won three consecutive five-setters beginning with the quarterfinals. In his quarterfinal with Martin Mulligan, Laver saved a matchpoint in the fourth set with a backhand volley after coming to the net behind a second serve. In the final, Laver lost the first two sets and was down 0–3 in the fourth set before coming back to defeat Emerson. At Wimbledon, his progress was much easier. Laver lost only one set the whole tournament, to Manuel Santana in a quarterfinal, who held a set point for a two set lead. In the final, Laver beat Mulligan in 52 minutes (a minute shorter than the previous year&#x27;s final). At the US Championships, Laver lost only two sets during the tournament and defeated Emerson again in the final. Laver was ranked world number one amateur for 1962 by Tingay, by Ned Potter and by an Ulrich Kaiser panel of 13 experts.

In February 1963, he appeared on the panel game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, where all four panelists identified him based on his knowledge of the history of tennis.

=== Professional ===
==== Before the Open Era (1963–68) ====
In December 1962 Laver turned professional after winning the Davis Cup with the Australian team. After an initial period of adjustment he quickly established himself among the leading professional players such as Ken Rosewall, Lew Hoad and Andrés Gimeno, and also Pancho Gonzales when Gonzales returned to a full-time schedule in 1964. During the next seven years, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times, including four in a row beginning in 1966.

In the beginning of 1963, Laver was beaten consistently by both Rosewall and Hoad on an Australasian tour. Hoad won the first eight matches against Laver, and Rosewall won 11 out of 13. However, Laver won the best-of-five set matches against Rosewall at Kooyong Stadium and at Adelaide&#x27;s Memorial Stadium. By the end of the year, with six tournament titles, Laver had become the No. 2 professional player behind Rosewall. In the first phase of the World Series tour, Laver finished second, with a 25–16 record. The top two players Rosewall and Laver then played a series of matches against each other to determine the champion. Rosewall won 14–4.

Laver&#x27;s gross earnings for 1963 were first among the pro players.

In 1964, Laver and Rosewall both won seven important titles (in minor tournaments Laver won four and Rosewall won three), but Laver won 17 of 24 matches against Rosewall and captured the two most prestigious titles, the US Pro Championships over Gonzales and the Wembley Championships over Rosewall. In Tennis Week, Raymond Lee described the Wembley match, where Laver came from 5–3 down in the fifth set to win 8–6, as possibly their best ever and one that changed tennis history. Lee regards this win as the one that began and established Laver&#x27;s long reign as world number one. The other prestige title, the French pro, was won by Rosewall. Rosewall finished top of the official points table in 1964 and after winning at Wembley, Laver said &quot;I&#x27;ve still plenty of ambitions left and would like to be the world&#x27;s No. 1. Despite this win, I am not there yet – Ken is.&quot;
In 1965, Laver was clearly the No. 1 professional player, winning 17 titles and 13 of 18 matches against Rosewall. In ten finals, Laver won eight against the still dangerous Gonzales. Laver won the Wembley Pro, beating Gimeno in the final.

In 1966, Laver won 16 events, including the US Pro Championships (beating Rosewall in a five-set final), the Wembley Pro Championship (beating Rosewall easily in the final), and eight other important tournaments.

In 1967, Laver won 19 titles, including the Wimbledon Pro (beating Rosewall in straight sets in the final), the US Pro Championships (beating Gimeno in the final), the Wembley Pro Championships (beating Rosewall in the final), and the French Pro Championship (beating Gimeno in the final), which gave him a clean sweep of the four most important professional titles, a professional Grand Slam. The Wimbledon Pro tournament in 1967 was the only professional event ever staged on Wimbledon&#x27;s Centre Court before the Open Era began.

==== During the Open Era (1968–76) ====
With the dawn of the Open Era in 1968, professional players were once again allowed to compete in Grand Slam events. Laver became Wimbledon&#x27;s first Open Era champion in 1968, beating the best amateur, American Arthur Ashe, in a semifinal and fellow-Australian Tony Roche in the final, both in straight sets. Laver was also the runner-up to Ken Rosewall in the first French Open. In this first &quot;open&quot; year, there were only eight open events besides Wimbledon and the French Open, where professionals, registered players, and amateurs could compete against each other. The professionals mainly played their own circuit, with two groups – National Tennis League (NTL) and World Championships Tennis (WCT) – operating. Laver was ranked No. 1 universally, winning the US Professional Championships on grass and the French Pro Championship on clay (both over John Newcombe). Laver also won the last big open event of the year, the Pacific Southwest in Los Angeles on hard courts. Ashe regarded Laver&#x27;s 4–6, 6–0, 6–0 final win over Ken Rosewall as one of his finest performances. Laver&#x27;s post-match comment was, &quot;This is the kind of match you always dream about. The kind you play at night in your sleep.&quot; Laver ranked No. 1 for 1968 by the panel of journalists for the &#x27;Martini and Rossi&#x27; Award, by an Ulrich Kaiser panel of 18 experts, by Seagrams (a panel of 15 journalists), by &quot;World Tennis&quot;, by Lance Tingay, by Rino Tommasi, by Bud Collins and by &quot;The Times&quot;.

In 1969, Laver won all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time, sealing the achievement with a four-set win over Roche in the US Open final. He won 18 of the 32 singles tournaments he entered (still the Open Era titles record) and compiled a 106–16 win–loss record. In beating Newcombe in four sets in the Wimbledon final, he captured the title at the All England Club for the fourth consecutive time that he had entered the tournament (and reached the final for the sixth consecutive time as he had been runner-up in 1959 and 1960). He set a record of 31 consecutive match victories at Wimbledon between 1961 and 1970, which lasted until 1980 when it was eclipsed by Björn Borg. Unlike his first Grand Slam year in 1962, Laver in 1969 played in events open to all the best professional and amateur players of the world. In the year&#x27;s Grand Slam tournaments, Laver had five five-set-matches, twice coming back from two sets down in early rounds. In the four finals, however, he lost a total of only two sets. His hardest match was a marathon 90-game semifinal against Roche at the Australian Open under tropical hot conditions. Other opponents at the Australian Open included Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle, and Andrés Gimeno. At the French Open, Laver beat Gimeno, Tom Okker, and Rosewall. At Wimbledon, Laver overcame strong challenges from Stan Smith, Cliff Drysdale, Ashe, and Newcombe. At the US Open on slippery grass courts, he defeated Dennis Ralston, Emerson, Ashe, and Roche. Laver proved his versatility by winning the Grand Slam tournaments on grass and clay, plus the two most important hard court titles (South African Open at Ellis Park, Johannesburg and the US Professional Championships at Boston) and the leading indoor tournaments (Philadelphia US Pro Indoor and Wembley British Indoor). Laver ranked No. 1 for 1969 by the panel of 13 international journalists for the &#x27;Martini and Rossi&#x27; Award, by Tingay, by Collins, by Tommasi, by Frank Rostron and by &quot;World Tennis&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Laver lost his grip on the major tournaments. He played only five Grand Slam tournaments from 1970 through 1972. This was partly because of his contracts with NTL and WCT. But on the WCT tours, he remained the leading player and by far the leading prize money winner.

In 1970, Laver won 15 titles and US$201,453 in prize money, including the rich &quot;Tennis Champions Classic&quot; and five other big events (Sydney Dunlop Open, Philadelphia, Wembley, Los Angeles, South African Open). Those were the equivalent of the modern day ATP Masters Series and most had 8 or more of the world&#x27;s top ranked players participating. With only two majors played by all the best players (Wimbledon and the US Open), there was no clear-cut World No. 1 in 1970. Wimbledon champion Newcombe, US champion Rosewall, and Laver (who won the most titles and had a 3–0 win–loss record against Newcombe and a 5–0 record against Rosewall) were ranked the highest by different journalists and expert panels. The panel of 10 international journalists who voted for the &#x27;Martini and Rossi&#x27; Award, ranked Rosewall No. 1 with 97 points over Laver (89 pts) and Newcombe (81 pts). The panel of 12 journalists which made the WCT draw for 1971 ranked Laver 1st, Rosewall 2nd and Newcombe 3rd. Rex Bellamy ranked Laver No. 1, with Rosewall No. 2. Judith Elian of &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; Magazine (Paris) and Rino Tommasi placed Rosewall No. 1, while Robert Geist co-ranked Rosewall, Laver and Newcombe No. 1. Newcombe later wrote in his autobiography &quot;Newk-Life On and Off the Court&quot; (2002) that the top honour for 1970 belonged to Laver. Lance Tingay, John McCauley and Bud Collins. ranked Newcombe ahead of Rosewall and Laver.

In 1971 Laver won seven titles, including the Italian Open in Rome on clay over Jan Kodeš, the reigning French Open champion. Laver successfully defended his title at the &quot;Tennis Champions Classic&quot;, winning 13 consecutive winner-take-all matches against top opponents and US$160,000. For the year, Laver won a then-record US$292,717 in tournament prize money and became the first tennis player to surpass US$1 million in career prize money. In 1971 and 1972, Laver finished as the points leader of the WCT tournament series but lost the playoff finals at Dallas to Rosewall. The last match is rated as one of the best of all time and drew a TV audience of over 20 million.

In 1972, Laver cut back his tournament schedule, partly because of back and knee injuries and his tennis camp businesses, but he still won five titles that year. In 1973, Laver won seven titles and successfully participated in the semifinals and final of the Davis Cup, where he won all six of his rubbers for Australia. In 1974 Laver won six titles from 13 tournaments and ended the year as World No. 4 based on the ATP point system. At 36, he was the oldest player during the Open Era to have been included in the year-ending top five.

In 1975, Laver set a record for WCT tournaments by winning four titles and 23 consecutive matches but in 1976, he semi-retired from the main tour, playing only a few selected events. He also signed with World Team Tennis, where he became &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; at the age of 38 but won five titles overall that season.

Overall, despite turning 30 just months after the Open Era began, Laver had tremendous success, winning 74 singles titles, which remains seventh most of the era. Plus, like most players of his day, he regularly played doubles, winning 37 titles.

Laver&#x27;s career earnings were approximately $1,540,000.

=== Rivalries ===

Laver had a long-running, friendly rivalry with Ken Rosewall between 1963, when he started out as a pro, and 1976, when both were semi-retired from the main tour. Including tournaments and one-night stands, they played over 130 matches, all of them as professionals, with some results from the barnstorming pro tours lost or badly recorded. Overall a match score of 89–75 in favour of Laver can be documented.

Against the older Pancho Gonzales, whom he played 1964 to 1970 on the pro tour, Laver had a lead of 43–22.

Laver had another, even longer rivalry with his fellow Queenslander Roy Emerson. They met first on the senior amateur tour in 1958 and dominated the amateur circuit until 1962, before Laver turned pro. When open tennis arrived in 1968, Emerson joined the pro tour, and had many new battles with Laver. Overall the score is 49–18 in favour of Laver, with 7–2 in major Grand Slam tournaments.

Laver had also many battles with Lew Hoad in his first years on the pro circuit 1963–1966. Although he lost the first eight matches in January 1963, Laver later in the year began to turn around their rivalry, and until 1966, he had built a 38–21 lead. Against Arthur Ashe, Laver had a head-to-head lead of 21–3, winning all of the first 18 matches. Ashe&#x27;s first win came in 1974, when Laver was 35. Another younger rival in the Open Era was John Newcombe, whom Laver led 16–5 in their head-to-head score.

=== Davis Cup ===
Laver helped Australia win the Davis Cup four consecutive times from 1959 to 1962. In 1973, professionals were permitted to play in the Davis Cup for the first time, and Laver was on a winning team for the fifth time, claiming two singles and a doubles rubber in the final as Australia beat the United States 5–0. Australia were crowned Davis Cup champions in each of the five seasons Laver played in the competition. Laver won 16 out of 20 Davis Cup singles matches and all four of his doubles.

== Playing style ==
Although of average height and medium build (), Laver developed a technically complete serve-and-volley game, with aggressive groundstrokes to back it up. Commentator Dan Maskell described him as &quot;technically faultless&quot;. His left-handed serve was well disguised and wide swinging. His groundstrokes on both flanks were hit with topspin, as was the attacking topspin lob, which Laver developed into a weapon. His stroke technique was based on quick shoulder turns, true swings, and accurate timing. His backhand, often hit on the run, was a point-ender that gave him an advantage. Laver was very quick and had a strong left forearm. Rex Bellamy wrote, &quot;The strength of that wrist and forearm gave him blazing power without loss of control, even when he was on the run and at full stretch. The combination of speed and strength, especially wrist strength, enabled him to hit ferocious winners when way out of court.&quot; At the net, he had forcing volleys, often hit as stroke volleys. Especially on the backhand, he could hit sharp underspin angles as well. He was difficult to lob, because of his springing agility, and when forced to retreat, he could come up with a vicious counterpunch.

As an amateur, Laver was a somewhat flashy player, often a late starter. He had to learn to control his adventurous shot-making and integrate percentage tennis into his game when he turned professional. In his prime, he could adapt his style to all surfaces and to all conditions. Laver had a strong record in five-set-matches, often turning things around with subtle changes of tactics.

== Tennis legacy ==
Laver is regarded by many as the greatest tennis player in the history of the sport. Laver was ranked the world No. 1 amateur in 1961 by Lance Tingay and in 1962 by Tingay and Ned Potter. Laver was the number one professional in some rankings in 1964, in all rankings from 1965 to 1969 and in some rankings in 1970.

Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter, ranked Laver only in the &quot;second echelon&quot; of great players, just behind the six best. He writes that although Laver was &quot;absolutely unbeatable for a year or two late in the 1960s&quot;, a &quot;careful comparison&quot; could be made between Laver and the somewhat older Gonzales and that Kramer is &quot;positive that Gonzales could have beaten Laver regularly.&quot; Kramer&#x27;s main argument for downgrading Laver is that, &quot;Ken Rosewall beat Laver in those two World Championship of Tennis finals and that was a title Laver really wanted.&quot; Kramer sees as evidence of Gonzales&#x27; superiority over Laver the fact that Gonzales defeated Laver in a five-set match before 15,000 spectators in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in January 1970, when Gonzales was 41 years old and Laver was still considered the World No. 1 player. On the other hand, Gonzales was still a top ten player when this match took place and Laver subsequently won this event, beating Gonzales in a straight-sets semifinal. Overall, his head-to-head-record with Gonzales was either 35–19 or 38–21 in favour of Laver, depending on the source. Laver was 12–5 against Gonzales during the Open Era, although Gonzales was then in his late thirties.

In 1975, Don Budge ranked his top five players of all time and rated Laver number five behind Vines, Kramer, Perry and Tilden.

In 1978, Ellsworth Vines ranked his all-time top 10 in &quot;Tennis Myth and Method&quot; and rated Laver number four behind Budge, Kramer and Gonzales.

In the early years of the 21st century, Sidney Wood compiled his list of the Greatest Players of All Time (later published posthumously in a memoir &quot;The Wimbledon final that never was and other tennis tales from a bygone era&quot;). Wood first entered Wimbledon in 1927 and won the title in 1931. &quot;From that time on, through to the late 1970s (doubles only towards the end), I was privileged to compete against virtually every top player in the world&quot; said Wood. Wood ranked Laver number five, behind Budge, Kramer, Tilden and Gonzales.

In 2014, Frank Sedgman, in his autobiography &quot;Game Sedge and Match&quot;, ranked Laver number three, behind Jack Kramer and Roger Federer, in his list of greatest male tennis players of all time.

Many experts disagree with Kramer&#x27;s assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Butch Buchholz, Cliff Drysdale, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver as the best of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, &quot;You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver&#x27;s the best player of all time.&quot; Trabert said in January 2008, &quot;I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he&#x27;s done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you&#x27;ve got to say Laver is the best player of all time.&quot; Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, &quot;Give him credit? Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [Greatest of All Time] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own.&quot; Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), and during the Open Era (18 in 1969). After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a &quot;Professional Grand Slam&quot; by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.
In 1983, Fred Perry ranked the greatest male players of all time and put them in to two categories, before World War 2 and after. Perry ranked Laver number one in the post-World War 2 list.

Laver came out on top in various experts polls for the best of all time. In 1986, the US magazine &quot;Inside Tennis&quot; polled 37 experts, which resulted in a computerised tournament. Laver ranked first on this list ahead of John McEnroe, Don Budge, Kramer, Björn Borg, Gonzales, Tilden, Jimmy Connors, Fred Perry, and Lew Hoad. In a poll by the Associated Press in 2000, Laver was voted &quot;The Male Tennis Player of the Century&quot;, ahead of Pete Sampras, Tilden, Borg, Budge, McEnroe and Hoad (tied), Rosewall and Roy Emerson (tied), and Kramer. In an article in &quot;Tennis Week&quot; in 2007, the tennis historian Raymond Lee statistically analysed the all-time best players. Laver topped his list ahead of Tilden and Borg (tied), Roger Federer, Gonzales, Rosewall, Budge, Ivan Lendl, Connors, Sampras, McEnroe, and Kramer. In 2009 it was written that Rod Laver &quot;is considered by most folks who saw him play and many who&#x27;ve heard of his accomplishments, to be as great a tennis player that ever lived—current players included.&quot;. In July 2017, tennis player Roger Federer called Rod Laver the greatest of all time.

In 1989, Bud Collins wrote, &quot;I remain unconvinced that there ever was a better player than Rod Laver&quot;. Thirteen years later, however, as editor of the &quot;Total Tennis, The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia&quot;, Collins was more guarded. He wrote that Laver would &quot;be known as possibly the greatest player ever&quot;, but also said that Gonzales was &quot;probably as good as anyone who ever played the game, if not better&quot;—and called Tilden &quot;perhaps the greatest player of them all&quot;. In an August 2006 article for MSNBC, Collins ranked Laver as one of the five top men&#x27;s tennis stars of all time, along with Tilden, Gonzales, Borg, and Sampras. He pointed to Tilden&#x27;s &quot;phenomenal .938 winning percentage&quot;, and said &quot;If I had to choose someone to play for my life it would be Pancho Gonzalez&quot;, praised Borg&#x27;s uncanny transition from the French Open to Wimbledon, cited Sampras&#x27;s &quot;assault on the citadels of the past&quot;, and called Laver &quot;in my eyes, the greatest player ever&quot;.

In 1973, the ATP&#x27;s computer rankings were established. Laver attained his highest ranking on that computer of World No. 3 in 1974. Laver&#x27;s highest year-end ranking by the ATP was World No. 4 in 1974. Laver semi-retired from the main professional tennis tour in 1975 while still being ranked in the top 10. In terms of yearly prize money won, Laver was the leader from 1964 until 1971. The number of tournament singles titles that Laver won during his career varies depending on the source. The ATP credits Laver with 72 Open Era titles while &quot;Total Tennis: The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia&quot; (edited by Bud Collins), give him 47 or 54 titles during the Open Era. Collins credits him with 184 titles in amateur, professional, and open competition, without listing them in detail.

Laver&#x27;s eleven Grand Slam singles titles currently place him tied with Borg for sixth place on the all-time list. Among his contemporaries, only Emerson won more Grand Slam singles titles during his career (12 to Laver&#x27;s 11), though more recently Federer, Nadal, Sampras, and Djokovic have surpassed this number. Laver also won eight Major doubles titles. Laver is the only player to have twice won all four Grand Slam singles tournaments during the same calendar year – the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. Because none of the Majors were played on hardcourts in Laver&#x27;s era, he never won a Grand Slam tournament on that surface. The tennis landscape today is different as half of the year&#x27;s Majors are played on hardcourts. Only six players have won Major titles on clay, grass and hardcourts: Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are the only players in history to have simultaneously held Grand Slam tournament titles on the three surfaces.

Previous observations change substantially if we also consider professional grand slam majors, which were played on two different surfaces in the 1963-67 period (grass and wood/parquet), and wherein Laver, like Rosewall, excelled. Furthermore, the ATP Performance Zone website lists his (partial) career win/loss percentage on hardcourt as .813, on carpet as .766, on grass as .827 and on clay as .764.

Laver was unable to compete in the Grand Slam tournaments during his professional career between 1963 and 1968 and it is argued he would likely have won more titles had he been able to do so. Sports columnist Malcolm Knox of the Sydney Morning Herald assesses the effect of Laver&#x27;s ban on competing in Grand Slams. He states: &quot;..if grand slams are taken as the benchmark, consider this. Laver won 11 of the 16 grand slam titles he contested in his prime. The pro tour put him out of 20 grand slams from age 23 to 28&quot;. Based on this he puts Laver and Rosewall in &quot;a class of two&quot;.

== Honours ==
In 2000, the centre court at Melbourne Park, which today hosts the Australian Open, was named the Rod Laver Arena in his honour. In 2016, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia.

The hall at the Rockhampton Tennis Association&#x27;s Victoria Park precinct in Wandal where Laver competed until the age of 14 was named the Rod Laver Hall upon its completion in December 1963 in recognition of his Grand Slam win the previous year.

In 1969, Laver was awarded the ABC Sportsman of the Year Award and the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 and upgraded to a Legend of Australian Sport in 2002. He is also an Australian Living Treasure. In 1998, Laver received the Philippe Chatrier Award (the ITF&#x27;s highest accolade) for his contributions to tennis and in 2000, Centre Court at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne was renamed Rod Laver Arena.

Laver was named as a Queensland Great in June 2005. In 2009, he was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame. Also in 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Laver was named one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland.

Bronze busts of Laver and Margaret Court by sculptor Barbara McLean were unveiled at Melbourne Park in 1993 upon their induction into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame. Another bronze bust of Laver, also by McLean, was installed on the banks of the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton&#x27;s city centre which was unveiled by Laver and Rockhampton City Council deputy mayor Dell Bunt on 7 December 2002. There was some concern raised by the local community when the bust was removed in 2016 during the riverbank redevelopment. However, the bust was re-installed upon the completion of the redevelopment which was officially opened in 2018, with the recreational precinct on the low bank being named Rod Laver Plaza. A bronze statue of Laver by sculptor Lis Johnson was unveiled at Melbourne Park prior to the 2017 Australian Open.

==Personal life==
On 27 July 1998, Laver suffered a stroke while being interviewed by ESPN-TV in the United States for their &quot;SportsCentury&quot; 20th Century sports retrospective series. He was hospitalised for a month and suffered from memory and speech difficulties after the stroke, but recovered over the course of the following year.

In 1966, Laver married Mary Benson in San Rafael, California. Born Mary Shelby Peterson in Illinois, she was a divorcee with three children and ten years his senior. Together, they had a son named Rick. The family lived at various locations in California including Rancho Mirage, Corona del Mar, a ranch near Santa Barbara and Carlsbad. Mary Laver died in November 2012 at the age of 84 at their home in Carlsbad. Since 2018, he has been living with his partner Susan Johnson, a widow from Florida.

In 1985, Laver&#x27;s cousin was killed in the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191; the latter&#x27;s son survived the crash.

Laver resides in Carlsbad, California, and attended San Diego Chargers games on occasion. On 1 October 2017, he was inducted into the Southern California Tennis Hall of Fame.

== Performance timeline ==
Laver joined the professional tennis circuit in 1963 and as a consequence was banned from competing in the amateur Grand Slams until the start of the Open Era at the 1968 French Open.

<text>Luca Signorelli ( – 16 October 1523) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Cortona, in Tuscany, who was noted in particular for his ability as a draftsman and his use of foreshortening. His massive frescos of the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; (1499–1503) in Orvieto Cathedral are considered his masterpiece. 

In his early 40s he returned to live in Cortona, after working in Florence, Siena and Rome (1478–84, painting a now lost section of the Sistine Chapel). With an established reputation, he remained based in Cortona for the rest of his life, but often travelled to the cities of the region to fulfill commissions. He was probably trained by Piero della Francesca in Florence, as his cousin Giorgio Vasari wrote. 

Cortona hosted a major exhibition in 2023 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his death.

== Biography ==
He was born Luca d&#x27;Egidio di Ventura in Cortona, Tuscany (some sources call him Luca da Cortona). The precise date of his birth is uncertain, but birth dates between 1441 and 1445 have been proposed. He died in 1523 in his native Cortona, where he is buried.

His first impressions of art seem to originate in Perugia – including the styles of artists such as Benedetto Bonfigli, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo and Pinturicchio. Lazzaro Vasari, the great-grandfather of art historian Giorgio Vasari, was Luca&#x27;s maternal uncle. According to Giorgio Vasari, Lazzaro had Luca apprenticed to Piero della Francesca. In 1472 the young artist was painting at Arezzo, and in 1474 at Città di Castello. He presented to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici a work which is likely &quot;School of Pan&quot;. Janet Ross and her husband Henry discovered the painting in Florence and subsequently sold it to the Kaiser Frederick Museum in Berlin, though it was destroyed there a few days after the end of World War II. The painting&#x27;s subject is almost the same as that which he also painted on the wall of the Petrucci palace in Siena – the principal figures being Pan himself, Olympus, Echo, a man reclining on the ground, and two listening shepherds.

Signorelli worked in central Italy, leading a very requested workshop, increasing his importance during the 1490s. He often returned to his native Cortona, and worked in nearby Umbria, especially in Città di Castello, where he left one of his masterpieces: &quot;the Martyrdome of St Sebastian&quot; (still in the umbrian town). This painting was very influential for the young Raphael, who worked in the same town and sketched some drawings of the &quot;Martyrdom&quot;. 

In 1498, Signorelli moved to the Monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore south of Siena, where he painted eight frescoes, forming part of a vast series depicting the life of St. Benedict; they are at present much injured. In the palace of Pandolfo Petrucci he worked on various classic or mythological subjects, including the aforementioned &quot;School of Pan&quot;. Signorelli remained healthy until his death, continuing to paint and accept commissions into his final year, including the altarpiece of the Church at Foiano.

== Work in Orvieto ==


From the Monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore near Siena, Signorelli went to Orvieto and produced his masterpiece, the frescoes in the chapel of S. Brizio (then called the Cappella Nuova), in the cathedral.

The Cappella Nuova already contained two groups of images in the vaulting over the altar, the Judging Christ and the Prophets, murals initially begun by Fra Angelico fifty years prior. The works of Signorelli in the vaults and on the upper walls represent the events surrounding the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment. The events of the Apocalypse fill the space which surrounds the entrance into the large chapel.

The Apocalyptic events begin with the &quot;Preaching of Antichrist&quot;, and proceed to the &quot;Doomsday&quot; and &quot;The Resurrection of the Flesh&quot;. They occupy three vast lunettes, each of them a single continuous narrative composition. In one of them, the Antichrist, after his portents and impious glories, falls headlong from the sky, crashing down into an innumerable crowd of men and women.

The events of the Last Judgment fill the facing vault and the walls around the altar. The series is composed of &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;the&quot; &quot;Elect and the Condemned&quot;, &quot;Hell&quot;, the &quot;Resurrection of the Dead&quot;, and the &quot;Destruction of the Reprobate&quot;.
To Angelico&#x27;s ceiling, which contained the &quot;Judging Christ&quot; and the &quot;Prophets&quot; led by John the Baptist, Signorelli added the &quot;Madonna leading the Apostles&quot;, the &quot;Patriarchs&quot;, &quot;Doctors of the Church&quot;, &quot;Martyrs&quot;, and &quot;Virgins&quot;. The unifying factor of the paintings is found in the scripture readings in the Roman liturgies for the Feast of All Saints and Advent.

Stylistically, the daring and terrible inventions, with their powerful treatment of the nude and arduous foreshortenings, were striking in their day. Michelangelo is claimed to have borrowed, in his own fresco at the Sistine Chapel wall, some of Signorelli&#x27;s figures or combinations. The lower walls, in an unprecedented style, are richly decorated with a great deal of subsidiary work connected with Dante, specifically the first eleven books of his &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, and with the poets and legends of antiquity. A &quot;Pietà&quot; composition in a niche in the lower wall contains explicit references to two important Orvietan martyr saints, San Pietro Parenzo and San Faustino.

The contract for Signorelli&#x27;s work is still on record in the archives of the Cathedral of Orvieto. He undertook the task of completing the ceiling on April 5, 1499 for 200 ducats, as well as 600 ducats for the walls, along with lodging, and a monthly payment of two measures of wine and two quarters of corn. The contract directed Signorelli to consult the Masters of the Sacred Page for theological matters. This is the first such recorded instance of an artist receiving theological advice, although art historians believe such discussions were routine. Signorelli&#x27;s first stay in Orvieto lasted no more than two years. In 1502 he returned to Cortona, later returning to Orvieto to continue the lower walls. He painted a dead Christ, with Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, and the local martyr Saints Pietro Parenzo and Faustino. The figure of the dead Christ, according to Vasari, is the image of Signorelli&#x27;s son Antonio, who died from the plague during the course of the execution of the paintings.

== Work in Siena, Cortona, Rome, and Arezzo ==

After finishing the frescoes at Orvieto, Signorelli was often in Siena. In 1507 he executed a great altarpiece for S. Medardo at Arcevia in the Marche, the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, with the &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; and other episodes.

In 1508 Pope Julius II summoned artists to Rome, including Signorelli, Perugino, Pinturicchio and Il Sodoma to paint the large rooms in the Vatican Palace. They began work, but soon the Pope dismissed all to make way for Raphael. Their work was taken down, except for the ceiling in the Stanza della Segnatura. Luca returned to Siena, but mostly lived in his hometown of Cortona. He was constantly at work, but the products of his closing years were not of the quality of his works from 1490 to 1505.

In 1520 Signorelli went with one of his pictures to Arezzo. He was partially paralyzed when he began a fresco of the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; in the chapel of Cardinal Passerini&#x27;s palace near Cortona, which is the last picture attributed to him (alternatively, a &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; at Foiano della Chiana). Signorelli stood in great repute as a citizen, entering the magistracy of Cortona as early as 1488 and holding a leading position by 1523, the year of his death.

Signorelli paid great attention to anatomy. It is said that he carried on his studies in burial grounds, and his mastery of the human form implies a familiarity resulting from dissections. He surpassed contemporaries in showing the structure and mechanism of the nude in immediate action, even going beyond nature in experiments of this kind, trying hypothetical attitudes and combinations. His drawings in the Louvre demonstrate this and bear a close analogy to the method of Michelangelo. He aimed at powerful truth rather than nobility of form; comparatively neglecting color, and his chiaroscuro exhibits sharp oppositions of lights and shadows. He had a vast influence over the painters of his own and of succeeding times, but had no pupils or assistants of high repute; one being a nephew named Francesco.

Vasari, who claimed Signorelli as a relative, described him as kindly, and a family man, and said that he always lived more like a nobleman than a painter. Vasari included Signorelli&#x27;s portrait, one of seven, in his study in Arezzo, along with Michelangelo and himself. The Torrigiani Gallery in Florence contains a grand life-sized portrait by Signorelli of a man in a red cap and vest, and corresponds with Vasari&#x27;s observation. In the National Gallery, London, are the &quot;Circumcision of Christ&quot; and three other works. Legend holds that Signorelli depicted himself in the left foreground of his Orvietan mural &quot;The Preaching of the Antichrist&quot;. Fra Angelico, his predecessor in the Orvieto cycle, is thought to stand behind him in the piece. However, the figure thought to be Fra Angelico is not dressed as a Dominican friar, and Signorelli&#x27;s supposed portrait does not match that in Vasari&#x27;s study.

<text>Philip Massinger (1583 – 17 March 1640) was an English dramatist. His plays, including &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot;, &quot;The City Madam&quot;, and &quot;The Roman Actor&quot;, are noted for their satire and realism, and their political and social themes.

==Early life==
The son of Arthur Massinger or Messanger, he was baptised at St. Thomas&#x27;s Salisbury on 24 November 1583. He apparently belonged to an old Salisbury family, for the name occurs in the city records as early as 1415. He is described in his matriculation entry at St. Alban Hall, Oxford (1602), as the son of a gentleman. His father, who had also been educated at St. Alban Hall, was a member of parliament, and was attached to the household of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Herbert recommended Arthur in 1587 for the office of examiner in the Court of the Marches.

William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who would come to oversee the London Stage and the royal company as King James&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain, succeeded to the title in 1601. It has been suggested that he supported Massinger at Oxford, but the omission of any reference to him in any of Massinger&#x27;s prefaces points to the contrary. Massinger left Oxford without a degree in 1606. His father had died in 1603, and that may have left him without financial assistance. The lack of a degree and the want of patronage from Lord Pembroke may both be explained on the supposition that he had become Roman Catholic. On leaving the university he went to London to make his living as a dramatist, but his name cannot be definitely affixed to any play until fifteen years later, when &quot;The Virgin Martyr&quot; (registered with the Stationers Company, 7 December 1621) appeared as the work of Massinger and Thomas Dekker.

==First plays==
During these years he worked in collaboration with other dramatists. A joint letter, from Nathan Field, Robert Daborne and Philip Massinger, to Philip Henslowe, begs for an immediate loan of five pounds to release them from their &quot;unfortunate extremity&quot;, the money to be taken from the balance due for the &quot;play of Mr. Fletcher&#x27;s and ours.&quot; A second document shows that Massinger and Daborne owed Henslowe £3 on 4 July 1615. The earlier note probably dates from 1613, and from this time Massinger apparently worked regularly with John Fletcher. Sir Aston Cockayne, Massinger&#x27;s constant friend and patron, refers in explicit terms to this collaboration in a sonnet addressed to Humphrey Moseley on the publication of his folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher (&quot;Small Poems of Divers Sorts&quot;, 1658), and in an epitaph on the two poets he says: &quot;Plays they did write together, were great friends, And now one grave includes them in their ends.&quot;

==Massinger and the King&#x27;s Men==
After Philip Henslowe&#x27;s death in 1616 Massinger and Fletcher began to write for the King&#x27;s Men. Between 1623 and 1626 Massinger produced unaided for the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men, then playing at the Cockpit Theatre, three pieces, &quot;The Parliament of Love&quot;, &quot;The Bondman&quot; and &quot;The Renegado&quot;. With the exception of these plays and &quot;The Great Duke of Florence&quot;, produced in 1627 by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men, Massinger continued to write regularly for the King&#x27;s Men until his death. The tone of the dedications of his later plays affords evidence of his continued poverty. In the preface to &quot;The Maid of Honour&quot; (1632) he wrote, addressing Sir Francis Foljambe and Sir Thomas Bland: &quot;I had not to this time subsisted, but that I was supported by your frequent courtesies and favours.&quot;

The prologue to &quot;The Guardian&quot; (licensed 1633) refers to two unsuccessful plays and two years of silence, when the author feared he had lost the popular favour. It is probable that this break in his production was owing to his free handling of political matters. In 1631, Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, refused to license an unnamed play by Massinger because of &quot;dangerous matter as the deposing of Sebastian, King of Portugal&quot;, calculated presumably to endanger good relations between England and Spain. There is little doubt that this was the same piece as &quot;Believe as You List&quot;, in which time and place are changed, Antiochus being substituted for Sebastian, and Rome for Spain. In the prologue, Massinger ironically apologises for his ignorance of history, and professes that his accuracy is at fault if his picture comes near &quot;a late and sad example.&quot; The obvious &quot;late and sad example&quot; of a wandering prince could be no other than Charles I&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Elector Palatine. An allusion to the same subject may be traced in &quot;The Maid of Honour&quot;. In another play by Massinger, not extant, Charles I is reported to have himself struck out a passage put into the mouth of Don Pedro, king of Spain, as &quot;too insolent.&quot; The poet seems to have adhered closely to the politics of his patron, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, who had leanings to democracy and was a personal enemy of the Duke of Buckingham. The servility towards the Crown displayed in Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s plays reflected the temper of the court of James I. The attitude of Massinger&#x27;s heroes and heroines towards kings is very different. Camiola&#x27;s remarks on the limitations of the royal prerogative (&quot;Maid of Honour&quot;, Act V, Scene v) could hardly be acceptable at court.

==Death==
Massinger died suddenly at his house near the Globe Theatre, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Saviour&#x27;s, Southwark, on 18 March 1640. In the entry in the parish register he is described as a &quot;stranger&quot;, which, however, implies nothing more than that he belonged to another parish. He is buried in the same tomb as Fletcher. That grave can be seen to this day in the chancel of what is now Southwark Cathedral near London Bridge on the south bank of the Thames. There the names of Fletcher and Massinger appear on adjacent plaques laid in the floor between the choir stalls. Next to these is a plaque commemorating Edmund Shakespeare (William&#x27;s younger brother) who is buried in the cathedral, although the exact location of his grave is unknown.

==Religion and politics==
The supposition that Massinger was a Roman Catholic rests upon three of his plays, &quot;The Virgin Martyr&quot; (licensed 1620), &quot;The Renegado&quot; (licensed 1624) and &quot;The Maid of Honour&quot; (c. 1621). &quot;The Virgin Martyr&quot;, in which Dekker probably had a large share, is really a miracle play, dealing with the martyrdom of Dorothea in the time of Diocletian, and the supernatural element is freely used. Caution must be used in interpreting this play as an elucidation of Massinger&#x27;s views; it is not entirely his work. In &quot;The Renegado&quot;, however, the action is dominated by the beneficent influence of a Jesuit priest, Francisco, and the doctrine of baptismal regeneration is enforced. In &quot;The Maid of Honour&quot; a complicated situation is solved by the decision of the heroine, Camiola, to take the veil. For this she is held up &quot;to all posterity a fair example for noble maids to imitate.&quot;

Conversely, characters in Massinger&#x27;s plays sometimes masquerade as Catholic clergy (&quot;The Bashful Lover&quot;) and even hear believers&#x27; confessions (&quot;The Emperor of the East&quot;)—a violation of a sacrament that would be surprising for a Catholic.

As noted above, Massinger placed moral and religious concerns over political considerations, in ways that offended the interests of king and state in his generation. While not a &quot;democrat&quot; in any modern sense (no one in his society was), Massinger&#x27;s political sympathies, insofar as we can determine them from his works, might have placed him in a predicament similar to that of the head of the house he revered, the Earl of Pembroke—who found that he could not support King Charles in the English Civil War, and became one of the few noblemen to back the Parliamentary side. Massinger did not live long enough to have to take a position in that conflict.

==Style and influence==
It seems doubtful whether Massinger was ever a popular playwright, for the best qualities of his plays would appeal rather to politicians and moralists than to the ordinary playgoer. He contributed, however, at least one great and popular character to the English stage. Sir Giles Overreach, in &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot;, is a sort of commercial Richard III, a compound of the lion and the fox, and the part provides many opportunities for a great actor. He made another considerable contribution to the comedy of manners in &quot;The City Madam&quot;. In Massinger&#x27;s own judgment &quot;The Roman Actor&quot; was &quot;the most perfect birth of his Minerva.&quot; It is a study of the tyrant Domitian, and of the results of despotic rule on the despot himself and his court. Other favourable examples of his grave and restrained art are &quot;The Duke of Milan&quot;, &quot;The Bondman&quot; and &quot;The Great Duke of Florence&quot;.

For an examination of William Shakespeare&#x27;s influence on Massinger, see T. S. Eliot&#x27;s essay on Massinger. It includes the famous line, &quot;Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal...&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Making Massinger&quot;, a play by Simon Butteriss, was recorded and streamed by Wiltshire Creative, who commissioned it. The play is in verse and described as a revenge tragicomedy. The cast includes Samuel Barnett, Edward Bennett, Hubert Burton, Julia Hills, Jane How and Nina Wadia.

With Thomas Middleton and William Rowley:
*&quot;The Old Law&quot;, comedy (c. 1615–18; printed 1656).

Some of these &quot;collaborations&quot; are in fact more complex: revisions by Massinger of older plays by Fletcher and others, etc. (It is not necessary to suppose that Massinger, Fletcher, Ford, and Rowley-or-Webster sat down in a room together to write a play.)

More than a dozen of Massinger&#x27;s plays are said to be lost, though the titles of some of these may be duplicates of those of existing plays. Eleven of these lost plays were manuscripts used by John Warburton&#x27;s cook for lighting fires and making pies. The tragedy &quot;The Jeweller of Amsterdam&quot; (c. 1616–19) may be a lost collaboration, with Fletcher and Field.

The list given above represents a consensus of scholarship; individual critics have assigned various other plays, or portions of plays, to Massinger—like &quot;The Faithful Friends,&quot; or the first two acts of &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (1611).

Massinger&#x27;s independent works were collected by Thomas Coxeter (4 vols., 1759, revised edition with introduction by Thomas Davies, 1779), by J. Monck Mason (4 vols., 1779), by William Gifford (4 vols., 1805, 1813), by Hartley Coleridge (1840), by Lt. Col. Cunningham (1867), and selections by Arthur Symons in the Mermaid Series (1887–1889).

Subsequent work on Massinger includes Philip Edwards and Colin Gibson, eds., &quot;The Plays and Poems of Philip Massinger&quot; (5 vols., Oxford, 1976), Martin Garrett, ed., &quot;Massinger: the Critical Heritage&quot; (London, 1991), chapters in Annabel Patterson, &quot;Censorship and Interpretation: the Conditions of Writing and Reading in Early Modern England&quot; (Madison, 1984) and Martin Butler, &quot;Theatre and Crisis 1632–1642&quot; (Cambridge, 1984), and Martin Garrett, &quot;Philip Massinger&quot; in the revised &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (Oxford, 2005).

<text>Sir Adolphus William Ward (2 December 1837 – 19 June 1924) was an English historian and man of letters.

==Life==
Ward was born at Hampstead, London, the son of John Ward. He was educated in Germany and at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

In 1866, Ward was appointed professor of history and English literature in Owens College, Manchester, and was principal from 1890 to 1897, when he retired. He took an active part in the foundation of Victoria University, of which he was vice-chancellor from 1886 to 1890 and from 1894 to 1896, and he was a founder of Withington Girls&#x27; School in 1890. He was a Member of the Chetham Society, serving as a member of council from 1884 and as president from 1901 until 1915.

In 1897, the freedom of the city of Manchester was conferred upon him, he delivered the Ford Lectures at the University of Oxford in 1898, and on 29 October 1900 he was elected master of Peterhouse, Cambridge.

He was elected in 1903 a fellow of the British Academy and was the academy&#x27;s president from 1911 to 1913. In 1919 he delivered the British Academy&#x27;s Shakespeare Lecture.

Ward served as president of the Royal Historical Society from 1899 to 1901, and he was knighted in 1913.

==Works==
Ward&#x27;s major work is his standard &quot;History of English Dramatic Literature to the Age of Queen Anne&quot; (1875), re-edited after a thorough revision in three volumes in 1899. He also wrote &quot;The House of Austria in the Thirty Years&#x27; War&quot; (1869), &quot;Great Britain and Hanover: Some Aspects of the Personal Union&quot; (1899), and &quot;The Electress Sophia and the Hanoverian Succession&quot; (1903) (2nd ed. 1909). His &quot;Germany, 1815–1890&quot; has three volumes.

Ward edited George Crabbe&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (2 vols., 1905–1906) and Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (1869); he wrote the volumes on Geoffrey Chaucer and Charles Dickens in the &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series, translated Ernst Curtius&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot; (5 vols., 1868–1873); with G. W. Prothero and Stanley Mordaunt Leathes he edited the &quot;Cambridge Modern History&quot; between 1901 and 1912, and with A. R. Waller edited the &quot;Cambridge History of English Literature&quot; (1907, etc.).

Ward&#x27;s collected papers were published in 5 volumes by Cambridge University Press in 1921.

<doc id="221428" wikidata="Q215519" url="?curid=221428" title="Democratic Unionist Party">
<text>The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is a unionist, loyalist, British nationalist and national conservative political party in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1971 during the Troubles by Ian Paisley, who led the party for the next 37 years. It is currently led by Gavin Robinson, who initially stepped in as an interim after the resignation of Jeffrey Donaldson. It is the second-largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and won five seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the 2024 election. The party has been mostly described as right-wing and socially conservative, being anti-abortion and opposing same-sex marriage. The DUP sees itself as defending Britishness and Ulster Protestant culture against Irish nationalism and republicanism. It is also Eurosceptic and supported Brexit.

The DUP evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party and has historically strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the church Paisley founded. During the Troubles, the DUP opposed sharing power with Irish nationalists or republicans as a means of resolving the conflict, and likewise rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs. It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973, the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. In the 1980s, the DUP was involved in setting up the loyalist paramilitary movements Third Force and Ulster Resistance, the latter of which helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland.

For the first three decades of the DUP&#x27;s history, the Ulster Unionist Party was the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland; however, by 2004, the DUP had overtaken the UUP in terms of seats in both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the UK House of Commons. In 2006, the DUP co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and the following year agreed to enter into power-sharing devolved government with Sinn Féin, who agreed to support the Police Service, courts, and rule of law. Paisley became joint First Minister of Northern Ireland. However, the DUP&#x27;s only Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Jim Allister, and seven DUP councillors left the party in protest, founding the Traditional Unionist Voice.

Ian Paisley was succeeded as DUP leader and First Minister by Peter Robinson (2008–2015), then by Arlene Foster (2015–2021). After Foster was ousted, Edwin Poots briefly became leader and nominated Paul Givan as First Minister, but was himself forced to step down after three weeks. In June 2021, he was succeeded by Jeffrey Donaldson. In protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol, Givan resigned as First Minister in February 2022, collapsing the Northern Ireland Executive. On 30 January 2024, Donaldson announced that the DUP had agreed a deal with the UK government that resulted in power-sharing being restored. Donaldson resigned as leader on 29 March 2024 after being charged with historical sex offences, with the party&#x27;s deputy leader, Gavin Robinson, being appointed as interim leader and later confirmed as party leader in May 2024.

== History ==

=== 1970s ===

The Democratic Unionist Party evolved from the Protestant Unionist Party, which itself grew out of the Ulster Protestant Action movement. The DUP was founded on 30 September 1971 by Ian Paisley, leader of the Protestant Unionist Party, and Desmond Boal, formerly of the Ulster Unionist Party. Paisley, a well-known Protestant fundamentalist minister, was the founder and leader of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. He would lead both the DUP and the Free Presbyterian Church for the next 37 years, and his party and church would be closely linked. When the DUP formed, Northern Ireland was in the midst of an ethnic-nationalist conflict known as the Troubles, which began in 1969 and would last for the next thirty years. The conflict began amid a campaign to end discrimination against the Catholic/Irish nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force. This protest campaign was opposed, often violently, by unionists who viewed it as an Irish republican front. Paisley had led the unionist opposition to the civil rights movement. The DUP were more hardline or loyalist than the UUP and its founding arguably stemmed from worries of the Ulster Protestant working class that the UUP was not paying them enough heed.

The DUP opposed the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. The Agreement was an attempt to resolve the conflict by setting up a new assembly and government for Northern Ireland in which unionists and Irish nationalists would share power. The Agreement also proposed the creation of a Council of Ireland, which would facilitate co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The DUP won eight seats in the 1973 election to the Assembly. Along with other anti-Agreement unionists, the DUP formed the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) to oppose the Agreement. In the February 1974 UK election, the UUUC won 11 out of 12 Northern Ireland seats, while the pro-Agreement unionists failed to win any. On 15 May 1974, anti-Agreement unionists called a general strike aimed at bringing down the Agreement. The strike coordinating committee included DUP leader Paisley, the other UUUC leaders, and the leaders of the loyalist paramilitary groups. The strike lasted fourteen days and brought Northern Ireland to a standstill. Loyalist paramilitaries helped enforce the strike by blocking roads and intimidating workers. On the third day of the strike, loyalists detonated four car bombs in Dublin and Monaghan, killing 33 civilians. The strike led to the downfall of the Agreement on 28 May.

Following the downfall of the Agreement, in 1975 the British government set up a Constitutional Convention, an elected body of unionists and nationalists which would seek agreement on a political settlement for Northern Ireland. In the election to the convention, the UUUC (which included the DUP) won 53% of the vote. The UUUC opposed a power-sharing government and recommended only a return to majority rule (i.e. unionist rule). As this was unacceptable to nationalists, the convention was dissolved.

The DUP opposed UK membership of the European Economic Community (EEC). In June 1979, in the first election to the European Parliament, Paisley won one of the three Northern Ireland seats. He topped the poll, with 29.8% of the first preference votes. He retained that seat in every European election until 2004, when he was replaced by Jim Allister, who resigned from the DUP in 2007 while retaining his seat.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

During 1981, the DUP opposed the then-ongoing talks between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Taoiseach Charles Haughey. That year, Paisley and other DUP members attempted to create a Protestant loyalist volunteer militia—called the (Ulster) Third Force—which would work alongside the police and army to fight the Irish Republican Army (IRA). They organized large rallies where men were photographed in military formation waving firearms certificates. Paisley declared: &quot;This is a small token of the men who are placed to devastate any attempt by Margaret Thatcher and Charles Haughey to destroy the Union&quot;. The DUP helped organize a loyalist &#x27;Day of Action&#x27; on 23 November 1981, to pressure the British government to take a harder line against the IRA. Paisley addressed a Third Force rally in Newtownards, where thousands of masked and uniformed men marched before him. He declared: &quot;My men are ready to be recruited under the crown to destroy the vermin of the IRA. But if they refuse to recruit them, then we will have no other decision to make but to destroy the IRA ourselves!&quot; In December, Paisley claimed that the Third Force had 15,000–20,000 members. James Prior, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replied that private armies would not be tolerated.

The Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed by the British and Irish governments in November 1985, following months of talks between the two. The Agreement confirmed there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its citizens, and proposed the creation of a new power-sharing government. It also gave the Irish government an advisory role on some matters in Northern Ireland. Both the DUP and UUP mounted a major protest campaign against the Agreement, dubbed &quot;Ulster Says No&quot;. Both unionist parties resigned their seats in the British House of Commons, suspended district council meetings, and led a campaign of mass civil disobedience. There were strikes and mass protest rallies.

On 23 June 1986, DUP politicians occupied the Stormont Parliament Building in protest at the Agreement, while 200 supporters protested outside and clashed with police. The DUP politicians were forcibly removed by police the next day. On 10 July, Paisley and deputy DUP leader Peter Robinson led 4,000 loyalist supporters in a protest in which they &#x27;occupied&#x27; the town of Hillsborough. Hillsborough Castle is where the Agreement had been signed. On 7 August, Robinson led hundreds of loyalist supporters in an invasion of the village of Clontibret, in the Republic of Ireland. The loyalists marched up and down the main street, vandalised property, and attacked two Irish police officers (Gardaí) before fleeing back over the border. Robinson was arrested and convicted for unlawful assembly.

On 10 November 1986, a rally was held in which DUP politicians Paisley, Robinson and Ivan Foster announced the formation of the Ulster Resistance Movement (URM). This was a loyalist paramilitary group whose purpose was to &quot;take direct action as and when required&quot; to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism. Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Most, but not all, of the weaponry was seized by police in 1988. In 1989, URM members attempted to trade Shorts&#x27; missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime. Following these revelations, the DUP said that it had cut its links with the URM in 1987.

In the mid-1980s, the Irish republican party Sinn Féin began to contest and win seats in local council elections. In response, the DUP fought elections under the slogan &quot;Smash Sinn Féin&quot; and vowed to exclude Sinn Féin councillors from all council business. Their 1985 manifesto said &quot;The Sinn Féiners must be ostracised and isolated&quot; at all local government bodies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, DUP councillors attempted to exclude Sinn Féin councillors by ignoring them, boycotting their speeches, or drowning them out by making as much noise as possible – such as by heckling and banging tables.

In early January 1994, the UDA released a document calling for the repartition of Ireland with the goal of making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant. The plan was to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. The Irish Catholic/nationalist-majority areas would be handed over to the Republic, and those left in the rump state would be &quot;expelled, nullified, or interned&quot;. DUP press officer Sammy Wilson spoke positively of the document, calling it a &quot;valuable return to reality&quot; and lauded the UDA for &quot;contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity&quot;.

=== 1998–2004 ===
During the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s, the DUP was initially involved in the negotiations under former United States Senator George J. Mitchell that led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, but withdrew in protest when Sinn Féin, an Irish republican party with links to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), was allowed to participate while the IRA kept its weapons. The DUP opposed the Agreement in the Good Friday Agreement referendum, in which the Agreement was approved with 71.1% of the electorate in favour.

The DUP&#x27;s opposition was based on a number of reasons, including:
* The early release of paramilitary prisoners
* The mechanism to allow Sinn Féin to hold government office despite ongoing IRA activity
* The lack of accountability of ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive
* The lack of accountability of the North/South Ministerial Council and North/South Implementation Bodies

The DUP contested the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election that resulted from the Good Friday Agreement, winning 20 seats, the third-highest of any party. It then took up two of the ten seats in the multi-party power-sharing Executive. While serving as ministers, they refused to sit at meetings of the executive committee in protest at Sinn Féin&#x27;s participation. The Executive ultimately collapsed over an alleged IRA espionage ring at Stormont (see Stormontgate).

The Good Friday Agreement relied on the support of a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists in order for it to operate. During the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the DUP argued for a &quot;fair deal&quot; that could command the support of both unionists and nationalists. After the results of this election the DUP argued that support was no longer present within unionism for the Good Friday Agreement. They went on to publish their proposals for devolution in Ireland entitled &quot;Devolution Now&quot;. These proposals have been refined and re-stated in further policy documents including &quot;Moving on&quot; and &quot;Facing Reality&quot;.

In the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the DUP won 30 seats, the most of any party. In January 2004, it became the largest Northern Ireland party at Westminster, when MP Jeffrey Donaldson joined after defecting from the UUP. In December 2004, English MP Andrew Hunter took the DUP whip after earlier withdrawing from the Conservative Party, giving the party seven seats, in comparison to the UUP&#x27;s five, Sinn Féin&#x27;s four, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party&#x27;s (SDLP) three.

=== 2005–2007 ===
In the 2005 UK general election, the party reinforced its position as the largest unionist party, winning nine seats, making it the fourth largest party in terms of seats in the British House of Commons behind Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. In terms of votes, the DUP was the fourth largest party on the island of Ireland.

At the local government election of 2005, the DUP emerged as the largest party at local government level with 182 councillors across Northern Ireland&#x27;s 26 district councils. The DUP had a majority of the members on Castlereagh Borough Council, which had long been a DUP stronghold and was home to party leader Peter Robinson, also in Ballymena Borough Council, home to the party&#x27;s founder Ian Paisley, and finally Ards Borough Council. As well as outright control on these councils, the DUP was also the largest party in eight other councils – Antrim Borough Council, Ballymoney Borough Council, Banbridge District Council, Belfast City Council, Carrickfergus Borough Council, Coleraine Borough Council, Craigavon Borough Council and Newtownabbey Borough Council.

On 11 April 2006, it was announced that three DUP members were to be elevated to the House of Lords: Maurice Morrow, Wallace Browne, the former Lord Mayor of Belfast, and Eileen Paisley, a vice-president of the DUP and wife of DUP Leader Ian Paisley. None, however, sit as DUP peers.

On 27 October 2006, the DUP issued a four-page letter in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; newspaper asking &quot;Are the terms of Saint Andrew&#x27;s a basis of moving forward to devolution?&quot;, with responses to be received to its party headquarters by 8 November. It was part of the party&#x27;s policy of consultation with its electorate before entering a power-sharing government.

On 24 November 2006, Ian Paisley refused to nominate himself as First Minister of Northern Ireland designate. There was confusion between all parties whether he actually said that if Sinn Féin supported policing and the rule of law that he would nominate himself on 28 March 2007 after the Assembly elections on 7 March 2007. The Assembly meeting was brought to an abrupt end when the building had to be evacuated because of a security breach. Paisley later released a statement through the press office stating that he did in fact imply that if Sinn Féin supported policing and the rule of law, he would go into a power-sharing government with them. This was following a statement issued by 12 DUP MLAs stating that what Ian Paisley had said in the chamber could not be interpreted as a nomination.

In February 2007, the DUP suggested that it would begin to impose fines up to £20,000 on members disobeying the party whip on crucial votes. On 24 March 2007 the DUP party executive overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution put to them by the party officers that did not agree to an establishment of devolution and an executive in Northern Ireland by the Government&#x27;s deadline of 26 March, but did agree to setting up an executive on 8 May 2007.

On 27 March 2007, the party&#x27;s sole Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Jim Allister, resigned from the party, in opposition to the decision to enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin. He retained his seat as an independent MEP as leader of his new hard-line anti-St Andrews Agreement splinter group that he formed with other disaffected members who had left the DUP over the issue, Traditional Unionist Voice, a seat which he retained until Diane Dodds won the seat back for the DUP in 2009. MP Gregory Campbell warned on 6 April 2007 that his party would be watching to see if benefits flow from its agreement to share power with Sinn Féin.

=== Robinson leadership (2008–2015) ===

On 31 May 2008, the party&#x27;s central Executive Committee met at the offices of Castlereagh Borough Council where Ian Paisley formally stepped down as party leader and Peter Robinson was ratified as the new leader, with Nigel Dodds as his deputy.

On 11 June 2008, the party supported the government&#x27;s proposal to detain terrorist suspects for up to 42 days as part of the Counter-Terrorism Bill, leading &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper to dub all of the party&#x27;s nine MPs as part of &quot;Brown&#x27;s dirty dozen&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the party had been given &quot;sweeteners for Northern Ireland&quot; and &quot;a peerage for the Rev Ian Paisley&quot;, amongst other offers, to secure the bill.

Members of the DUP were lambasted by the press and voters, after MPs&#x27; expenses reports were leaked to the media. Several newspapers referred to the &quot;Swish Family Robinson&quot; after Peter Robinson, and his wife Iris, claimed £571,939.41 in expenses with a further £150,000 being paid to family members. Further embarrassment was caused to the party when its deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, had the highest expenses claims of any Northern Ireland MP, ranking 13th highest out of all UK MPs. Details of all MPs&#x27; expenses claims since 2004 were published in July 2009 under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

In January 2010, Peter Robinson was at the centre of a high-profile scandal relating to his 60-year-old MP/MLA wife Iris Robinson&#x27;s infidelity with a 19-year-old man, and alleged serious financial irregularities associated with the scandal.

In the 2010 general election, the party suffered a major upset when its leader, Peter Robinson, lost his Belfast East seat to Naomi Long of the APNI on a swing of 22.9%. However, the party maintained its position elsewhere, fighting off a challenge from the Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force in Antrim South and Strangford and from Jim Allister&#x27;s Traditional Unionist Voice in Antrim North.

The DUP were strongly criticised after the Red Sky scandal in which DUP ministers attempted to influence a decision at a meeting of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. The decision related to an £8 million contract of east Belfast firm Red Sky. The Housing Executive cancelled Red Sky&#x27;s contract after a BBC &quot;Spotlight&quot; investigation into the company, which was shown to be overcharging taxpayers. The DUP cited &quot;sectarian bias&quot; in relation to the decision. The party suspended DUP councillor Jenny Palmer, who sat on the executive board, after she confessed that DUP special adviser Stephen Brimstone pressured her into changing her vote at the meeting.

In the 2015 general election, when the result was expected to be a hung parliament, the issue of DUP and the UK Independence Party forming a coalition government with the UK Conservative Party was considered by Nigel Farage (leader of UKIP). The then Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, warned against this &quot;Blukip&quot; coalition, with a spoof website highlighting imagined policies from this coalition – such as reinstating the death penalty, scrapping all benefits for under 25s and charging for hospital visits. Additionally, issues were raised about the continued existence of the BBC (as the DUP, UKIP and Conservatives had made a number of statements criticising the institution) and support for same-sex marriage. However, in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live deputy leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds told BBC Newsline that the DUP was &quot;against discrimination based on religion ... or sexual orientation&quot;.

On 10 September 2015, Peter Robinson stepped aside as First Minister and other DUP ministers, with the exception of Arlene Foster, resigned their portfolios.

=== Foster leadership (2015–2021) ===
Arlene Foster became leader of the DUP on 17 December 2015, and served as First Minister of Northern Ireland from January 2016 to January 2017.

Two days before the UK Brexit referendum, held on 23 June 2016, the DUP paid £282,000 for a four-page glossy wrap-around to the free newspaper &quot;Metro&quot;, which is distributed in major towns and cities in the British mainland, but not Northern Ireland, advocating a &#x27;Leave&#x27; vote.

On 4 October 2016, First Minister Arlene Foster and DUP MPs held a champagne reception at the Conservative Party conference, marking what some have described as an &quot;informal coalition&quot; or an &quot;understanding&quot; between the two parties to account for the Conservatives&#x27; narrow majority in the House of Commons. The relationship between the parties was formalised after the 2017 United Kingdom general election with the signing of the Conservative–DUP agreement. In October 2017, the DUP held a similar reception at the Conservative Party conference, which was attended by leading Conservative figures including First Secretary of State Damian Green, Brexit Secretary David Davis, then-Chief Whip Gavin Williamson, and party chairman Patrick McLoughlin. This was reciprocated in November, when Damian Green and Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith attended the DUP&#x27;s conference, with Smith giving a keynote address. The third such annual DUP reception at the Conservative conference took place in October 2018, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson addressing the DUP conference a month later. Prominent Conservative MPs such as Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, former International Development Secretary Priti Patel, Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis, and European Research Group chair Jacob Rees-Mogg headlined various fundraising events for the DUP from 2017 onwards.

Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage also spoke at a DUP fundraiser in May 2018, with his main financial backer, Arron Banks, stating that he would support a bid by Farage to seek office as a DUP candidate after the end of his tenure as Member of the European Parliament in 2019.

In her capacity as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in 2012, Foster oversaw the establishment of a green energy scheme, which led to the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal (RHI scandal). The scheme gave a perverse incentive to use more energy and increase their carbon footprint to those who signed up to it since they could claim £1.60 for every £1 spent on heating with, for example, wood pellets. With no cost controls, it could cost the public purse up to £490 million.

Foster refused calls to step down as First Minister over her alleged role in the RHI scandal. In January 2017 this led Martin McGuinness to resign in protest and the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed. A snap election followed after Sinn Féin refused to re-nominate a deputy First Minister. In this Northern Ireland Assembly election, held in March 2017, the DUP lost 10 seats, leaving them only one seat and 1,200 votes ahead of Sinn Féin, a result described by the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. The withdrawal of the party whip from Jim Wells in May 2018 left the DUP on 27 seats, the same number as Sinn Féin.

In the 2017 UK general election, the DUP had 10 seats overall, 3 seats ahead of Sinn Féin. With no party having received an outright majority in the UK Parliament, the DUP entered into an agreement to support government by the Conservative Party. A DUP source said: &quot;The alternative is intolerable. For as long as Corbyn leads Labour, we will ensure there’s a Tory PM.&quot; The DUP would later withdraw their support over new Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s revised proposal for a deal with the EU.

At the 2019 UK general election, the DUP lost vote share and lost two of its seats.

Due to the RHI scandal and deadlock between the DUP and Sinn Féin, Northern Ireland did not have an Executive and the Assembly did not meet for three years. In January 2020, the main parties signed the New Decade, New Approach agreement and the Executive was re-formed with Foster as First Minister and Michelle O&#x27;Neill of Sinn Féin as deputy First Minister.

In April 2021, it was reported that the majority of DUP MLAs and MPs had signed a letter of no confidence in Foster. She therefore announced that she would step down as DUP leader in May and as First Minister in June.

=== Poots leadership (2021) ===
After Foster&#x27;s announcement, the DUP held its first ever leadership election in May 2021, with Edwin Poots becoming leader after narrowly defeating Jeffrey Donaldson. This caused a fracture in the party. Some DUP members spoke of their &quot;disgust&quot; at the way in which Foster had been ousted. There were claims that Poots supporters engaged in bullying and intimidation during the leadership election, and some party members walked out before his speech. Police also investigated claims the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) threatened members of Donaldson&#x27;s campaign team. Poots admitted party members were &quot;bruised&quot; but denied claims of intimidation. Several party members resigned, including councillors.

On 17 June 21 days after becoming DUP leader, Poots announced he would be resigning after an internal party revolt. He said he would stay in post until a successor was elected. He had agreed a deal whereby his close ally, Paul Givan, would become First Minister. In return, he would let Westminster pass Irish language law for Northern Ireland, which the DUP had earlier agreed to implement by signing the New Decade, New Approach agreement. Most DUP MLAs opposed Poots&#x27;s decision, forcing him to step down.

On 22 June, Jeffrey Donaldson was confirmed to be succeeding Poots, as the only candidate in the leadership contest.

=== Donaldson leadership (2021–2024) ===
Jeffrey Donaldson was ratified as DUP leader on 30 June 2021, and said his top priority was to get rid of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the post-Brexit trade arrangements. Hours after he became leader, MLA Alex Easton left the DUP, saying the party no longer had any &quot;respect, discipline or decency&quot;. This meant the DUP were no longer the biggest party in the Assembly.

As part of the party&#x27;s protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol, the DUP&#x27;s Paul Givan resigned as First Minister in February 2022, collapsing the Northern Ireland Executive.

In April, shortly before the 2022 Assembly election, all of the DUP&#x27;s officers in South Down refused to endorse the party&#x27;s candidate Diane Forsythe and resigned from the DUP.

In the May 2022 Assembly election, the DUP&#x27;s vote share dropped almost 7% and it lost three seats, making Sinn Féin the largest party for the first time. However, the DUP said they will not allow the election of a Speaker until their issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol are dealt with; meaning the Assembly cannot continue its business and a new Executive cannot be formed. The DUP were condemned by other parties for their actions.

In July 2022, the DUP voted to support Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a confidence vote, making it the only party besides the Conservative Party to do so.

Since the May 2022 election, the DUP has blocked the formation of a new Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.

Following the publication of the Windsor Framework, the DUP signalled opposition to the agreement. The party formed a panel to form a report on the plan, members included; Arlene Foster, Peter Robinson, Carla Lockhart, Lord Weir, Ross Reed, John McBurney, Brian Kingston and Deborah Erskine. David Kerr, the former UUP adviser to former First Minister David Trimble, has warned that DUP leadership risks splitting the party over its continued opposition to power sharing.

In the 2023 Northern Ireland local elections, the DUP was overtaken by the Sinn Fein as the largest party. While the DUP maintained its 122 seats, the Sinn Fein was able to win 39 new seats to jump to 144 seats. After the election, Chris Heaton-Harris called for the party to end the boycott of Sinn Féin and work alongside the party.

During Donaldson&#x27;s leadership, the DUP has developed a 5-point plan &quot;to build a better Northern Ireland within the Union&quot;, this includes &quot;supporting and boosting [the] National Health Service, growing [the] economy and creating jobs, tackling the cost of living crisis, securing a better education system and negotiating the removal of the Irish Sea Border.&quot;

On 29 January 2024, an urgent meeting of the DUP executive was called following the passing over the deadline to restore power sharing at Stormont. Details of the meeting were reportedly leaked to the BBC. Jeffrey Donaldson revealed in the morning that his party would return to Stormont. The Northern Ireland Executive formation ended 23 months of stalemate.

Donaldson resigned as leader on 29 March 2024 after being charged with historical sex offences. Gavin Robinson was named as interim leader.

=== Robinson leadership (2024-present) ===
On 29 May 2024, Gavin Robinson was confirmed as leader of the party by its executive - a role he had held on an interm basis since 29 March 2024.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the DUP lost three seats in Lagan Valley, North Antrim and South Antrim. This saw Sinn Fein elect the highest number of MPs in Northern Ireland with seven.

== Policies and views ==

=== Unionism ===
The Democratic Unionist Party are Ulster unionists, which means that they support Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom and are opposed to a united Ireland. The party sees itself as defending Britishness and Ulster Protestant culture against Irish nationalism and republicanism. It supports marching rights for the loyalist Orange Order, which many DUP members are members of; it is also in favour of flying the British Union Flag from government buildings all year round. The DUP assert that &quot;Irish and Gaelic culture should not be allowed to dominate funding&quot; in Northern Ireland and have blocked proposed laws that would promote and protect the Irish language. The DUP are staunch supporters of the British security forces and their role in the Northern Ireland conflict. The party wants to prevent British soldiers and police officers from being prosecuted for killings committed during the conflict.

=== Ulster loyalism ===
The party has also been described as right-wing populist and containing some extremist tendencies. It is linked to the Ulster loyalist faction of unionism, which has been identified as a form of ethnic nationalism. The DUP was endorsed in the 2017 general election by the Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella group of loyalist paramilitary groups, which are proscribed terrorist organisations. However, the party leadership strongly rejected the endorsement, with party leader Arlene Foster stating: &quot;We did not seek that statement, we did not seek endorsement from any paramilitary organisation and indeed I fundamentally reject an endorsement from anyone that&#x27;s involved with paramilitarism or criminality.&quot;

=== Euroscepticism and foreign policy ===
The DUP is a Eurosceptic party that supported the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum and was the only party in the Stormont power executive to campaign for leave. The party opposes a hard Irish border, and wishes to maintain the Common Travel Area.

Speaking as a member of the European Parliament in 1991, then leader Ian Paisley set out the DUP&#x27;s Eurosceptic position: 
Later in 1991, speaking at the DUP annual conference Paisley compared Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl to Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler.

East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson caused controversy in March 2016 during a &quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; episode discussing the implications of the EU referendum, when he was recorded agreeing with a member of the public who said that they wanted to leave the European Union and &quot;get the ethnics out&quot;. Wilson stated &quot;You are absolutely right&quot;. Wilson said he was agreeing with the desire to leave the European Union, not the &quot;ethnics out&quot; call. Wilson was criticised by the Polish consul in Northern Ireland and various other political parties.

The DUP strongly opposed the Northern Ireland backstop in 2019 seeing it as weakening Northern Ireland&#x27;s place within the United Kingdom, and this opposition was regarded by a number of commentators as the main reason why the withdrawal agreement was not ratified by the Parliament of the United Kingdom before 2020. During most of the May government, the DUP said the Northern Ireland backstop must be removed from the Brexit withdrawal agreement for continued support of Theresa May&#x27;s government in the House of Commons through the confidence and supply deal, although the party said that it was open to a time limit on the backstop.

The DUP voted &quot;No&quot; in all three meaningful votes on the EU Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Theresa May.

The DUP are strongly supportive of Israel.

In 2011, the DUP abstained on military intervention in Libya. The DUP opposed the British government&#x27;s proposed military intervention against Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War in 2013. However, the DUP supported military action against Islamic State targets in Syria in 2015.

=== LGBT rights ===

The DUP is socially conservative and has strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the small church founded by the party&#x27;s founder Ian Paisley. The vast majority of DUP members are evangelical Christians and, on average, 65% of its representatives since the party was founded have been Free Presbyterians. The party also has links with the Caleb Foundation, a Protestant fundamentalist pressure group.

The DUP has opposed LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. Party leaders—as well as many prominent party members—have condemned homosexuality, and a 2014 survey found that two-thirds of party members believe homosexuality is wrong.

==== Opposition to LGBT rights legislation ====
The DUP campaigned against the legalisation of homosexual acts, which it believed to be a &quot;harmful deviance&quot; linked to paedophilia, in Northern Ireland through the &quot;Save Ulster from Sodomy&quot; campaign between 1977 and 1982.

The Labour government elected in 1997 sought to reform the law to extend LGBT rights. The DUP consistently voted against the Labour government, including by voting against reducing of the age of consent for gay sex from 18 to 16 in June 1998 (and again in February 2000), against a motion for a gender-neutral Civil Registration Bill in October 2001, against allowing unmarried gay and straight couples to adopt children in November 2002, against the Gender Recognition Bill 2004, against the Civil Partnership Act 2004, for an amendment opposing the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007, and against same-sex female couples and single mothers accessing in vitro fertilisation in January 2008.

The party vetoed the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland from 2015 onwards, which for a time made Northern Ireland the only region of the UK where same-sex marriage was not permitted, prior to the passage of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019. Former DUP minister Jim Wells called the issue a &quot;red line&quot; for power-sharing talks, adding that &quot;Peter will not marry Paul in Northern Ireland&quot;. In August 2012, in the wake of a council debate on same-sex marriage, Magherafelt DUP councillor Paul McClean called for homosexuality to be made illegal again in Northern Ireland. In response, the DUP reiterated their support for the &quot;current definition of marriage&quot;, but did not comment with regard to outlawing homosexuality. McClean repeated his comments in April 2015, and a few days later, DUP leader Peter Robinson said that McClean was &quot;entitled to that opinion&quot;, and that if homosexuality was illegal, he would &quot;hope that people would obey the law&quot;.

The party attempted to introduce a &quot;conscience clause&quot; into law in Northern Ireland, which would let businesses refuse to provide a service if it went against their religious beliefs. This came after a Christian-owned bakery was taken to court for refusing to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan. Opponents argued that the clause would allow discrimination against LGBT people.

==== Homosexuality &#x27;cure&#x27; and conversion therapy controversies ====

In June 2008, Iris Robinson, commenting on a homophobic assault, offered to refer homosexuals to psychiatric counselling, suggesting it could &quot;cure&quot; him of his homosexuality. Although she condemned the attack, she called homosexuality an &quot;abomination&quot; that made her feel &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;nauseous&quot;. In July, Robinson stated in Parliament that homosexuality was &quot;viler&quot; than child sex abuse, adding she felt &quot;totally repulsed by both&quot;. In a subsequent statement that same day, however, she said that she had &quot;clearly intended to say that child abuse was even worse than homosexuality and sodomy&quot;. Her remarks were widely condemned by other parties and by the Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association, with SDLP MP Alasdair McDonnell saying her comments &quot;create space for all sorts of homophobic attacks&quot;.

In November 2015, the DUP deputy mayor of Derry and Strabane, Thomas Kerrigan, suggested that homosexuality could be &quot;cured&quot; through prayer, suggesting that young people not attending church left themselves open to lifestyles such as &quot;being gay&quot;, drinking, or taking drugs. Kerrigan&#x27;s remarks attracted condemnation from the Rainbow Project and from Bebe Johnston, the mother of a gay man from Derry who died by suicide. While the DUP indicated Kerrigan&#x27;s remarks were not party policy, they stated &quot;party members may hold personal views on this matter&quot;.

==== Internal dissent on LGBT issues ====
In recent years, the party has become more split on the issue of LGBT rights with some DUP members moderating their opinions on the matter. In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that Arlene Foster softening her stance on LGBT issues was a contributing factor in her resignation as leader. In July 2021, deputy leader Paula Bradley expressed an apology for the &quot;absolutely atrocious&quot; statements made by the party&#x27;s politicians about LGBT people and added &quot;there have been some very hurtful comments and some language that really should not have been used.”. Her apology was supported by DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson. In September 2021, Donaldson met with the Rainbow Project, the first official meeting between a DUP leader and an LGBT group.

However, the efforts of leading DUP figures to moderate the party&#x27;s position has faced resistance. In 2019, following the selection of Alison Bennington, the DUP&#x27;s first openly LGBT candidate (who would later be elected as a councillor), Ballymoney DUP alderman John Finlay issued a complaint to DUP party officers, stating his &quot;deep concern&quot; at &quot;the decision to select an openly gay candidate&quot;, remarking that &quot;Dr. Paisley must be turning in his grave&quot;.

=== Abortion ===
Party members have campaigned strongly against any extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland, unanimously opposing a bill by Labour MP Diana Johnson to protect women in England and Wales from criminal prosecution if they ended a pregnancy using pills bought online. They have opposed extra funding for international family planning programmes.

=== Economic and fiscal policies ===

The DUP is in favour of keeping the &quot;triple lock&quot; for pensions, the Winter Fuel Allowance, and greater spending in Northern Ireland for services such as health.

The DUP revived calls for a 25-mile sea bridge to link Northern Ireland with Scotland.

To address the cost of living crisis, in the May 2022 Assembly Election the DUP supported a windfall tax on energy firms, and an energy support payment &quot;to support hard-pressed families.&quot;

The party has been described as &quot;a right-wing party in terms of social issues, but left-of-centre on economic issues.&quot;

=== Social policy ===
Some DUP politicians have called for creationism to be taught in state schools, and for museums to include creationism in their exhibits. In 2007, a DUP spokesman confirmed that these views were in line with party policy.

In 2011, the DUP called for a debate in the House of Commons over bringing back the death penalty for some serious crimes such as murder or rape.

== Associations with loyalist paramilitaries ==

Though the party has never had official links to any major paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland, multiple DUP members have had associations with loyalist groups, or expressed support for their actions, particularly during the Troubles.
In 1972, William McCrea issued a press statement, saying, &quot;We call on all Loyalists to give their continued support to the Ulster Defence Association as it seeks to ensure the safety of all law-abiding citizens against the bombs and bullets of the IRA. As the Catholic population have given their support to the IRA throughout this campaign of terror so must Loyalists grant unswerving support to those engaged in the cause of truth.&quot; McCrea became the DUP party chairman in February 1976. 
He and fellow DUP member Ivan Foster conducted funerals for Wesley Somerville and Harris Boyle, two UVF members who were killed while carrying out the Miami Showband killings in 1975. Foster had given the graveside oration for Sinclair Johnston, a UVF member who was shot by police during rioting in Larne in 1972.

McCrea also conducted the funeral service for Benjamin Redfern, a UDA member who was crushed while trying to escape the Maze Prison in a bin lorry in 1984. Redfern was serving a life sentence for the murder of two Catholics.
In 1996, Billy Wright, a former UVF member who had founded the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force, organised a rally in defence of &#x27;free speech&#x27;. McCrea accepted an invitation to address the meeting.

Omagh businessman Eddie Sayers stood as a DUP candidate in the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election for the constituency of Mid Ulster, but was not elected. He later became active in the UDA, and was appointed Brigadier for its Mid Ulster Brigade.

Bangor DUP councillor Billy Baxter was arrested in 1993 and convicted for soliciting funds for the UVF. He was subsequently expelled from the party.

In July 1994, DUP press officer Sammy Wilson and DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson were pallbearers at the funeral of UDA member Ray Smallwoods, who served half of a 15-year sentence for the attempted murder of Bernadette McAliskey in 1981. That same year, the UDA drafted a document – the ‘Doomsday scenario’ – which declared that in the event of a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, the organisation&#x27;s aim would be to &quot;establish an ethnic Protestant homeland&quot; within which the Catholic population would be &quot;expelled, nullified or interned.&quot; Wilson praised the document, describing it as a &quot;very valuable return to reality&quot; which &quot;shows that some loyalist paramilitaries are looking ahead and contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity&quot;.

In 2006, George Seawright was listed by the UVF as one of its members killed during the Troubles. Seawright was elected a DUP Belfast City Councillor in 1981, and a DUP candidate in the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, though he was expelled from the party in 1984. His election agent was UVF leader John Bingham.

Former UVF member John Smyth, who was jailed for his activities in the 1970s, was a DUP councillor on the Antrim Borough Council for over a decade.

In 2014, Billy Hutchinson, a former member of the UVF who was convicted of murder in 1974, said that &quot;most UVF men are DUP supporters, or those who vote anyway&quot;.

In January 2023, DUP councillor and former Mayor of Lisburn Paul Porter took part in a march to mark the 25th anniversary of the shooting dead of UDA member Jim Guiney by the INLA. The march was criticised by Marian Walsh, whose 17-year-old son Damien was murdered by the UDA in 1993.

In 2023, Tyler Hoey was selected as a DUP candidate to contest the Mid and East Antrim Council elections. In 2020, Hoey &#x27;liked&#x27; a Twitter post commemorating the Greysteel massacre, which stated, &quot;On this day 27 years ago, An Ulster Freedom Fighters Active Service Unit from North Antrim-Londonderry Brigade &#x27;Trick or Treated&#x27; its way into the republican Rising Sun bar in Greysteel in order to gain revenge for the Shankill Bombing. Spirit of &#x27;93&quot;. Following this revelation, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said that Hoey &quot;deeply regrets some of the things that he said in the past&quot; and that he is &quot;entitled to a second chance.&quot;

== Leadership ==

Founder Ian Paisley led the party from its foundation in 1971 onwards, and retired as leader of the party in spring 2008.

Paisley was replaced by former deputy leader Peter Robinson on 31 May 2008, who in turn was replaced by Arlene Foster on 17 December 2015.

Foster announced in April 2021 that she would stand down as leader on 28 May 2021. Edwin Poots won the subsequent leadership election (the first in the party&#x27;s history), against Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, however he stepped down after just 20 days in office and was replaced as leader by Donaldson on 26 June 2021. Donaldson resigned with immediate effect on 29 March 2024. As a result of Donaldson&#x27;s resignation, deputy leader Gavin Robinson became the party&#x27;s acting leader the same day. Following the announcement on 22 May 2024 that the 2024 United Kingdom general election would be held on 4 July, Robinson&#x27;s leadership of the DUP was confirmed by the party executive on 29 May 2024 without a contested leadership election.

<text>In navigation, bearing or azimuth is the horizontal angle between the direction of an object and north or another object. The angle value can be specified in various angular units, such as degrees, mils, or grad. More specifically:
* [[#Absolute|Absolute bearing]] refers to the clockwise angle between the magnetic north (&quot;magnetic bearing&quot;) or true north (&quot;true bearing&quot;) and an object. For example, an object to due east would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees. Thus, it is the same as [[azimuth]].
* [[#Relative|Relative bearing]] refers to the angle between the craft&#x27;s forward direction (heading) and the location of another object. For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be immediately in front; an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind. Bearings can be measured in mils, points, or degrees. Thus, it is the same as an &quot;azimuth difference&quot; (modulo +/- 360 degrees).

Alternatively, the US Army defines the &quot;bearing&quot; from point A to point B as the smallest angle between the ray AB and either north south, whichever is closest. The bearing is expressed in terms of 2 characters and 1 number: first, the character is either N or S; next is the angle numerical value; third, the character representing the perpendicular direction, either E or W. The bearing angle value will always be less than 90 degrees. For example, if Point B is located exactly southeast of Point A, the bearing from Point A to Point B is &quot;S 45° E&quot;. 
For example, if the bearing between Point A and Point B is S 45° E, the azimuth between Point A and Point B is 135°. 
==Types==

===Absolute===
In nautical navigation the absolute bearing is the clockwise angle between north and an object observed from the vessel.

If the north used as reference is the true geographical north then the bearing is a &quot;true bearing&quot; whereas if the reference used is magnetic north then the bearing is a &quot;magnetic bearing&quot;. 
An absolute bearing is measured with a bearing compass.

The measurement of absolute bearings of fixed landmarks and other navigation aids is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the nautical chart together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel.

A &quot;grid bearing&quot; (also known as grid azimuth) is measured in relation to the fixed horizontal reference plane of grid north, that is, using the direction northwards along the grid lines of the map projection as a reference point.

A &quot;compass bearing&quot;, as in vehicle or marine navigation, is measured in relation to the magnetic compass of the navigator&#x27;s vehicle or vessel (if aboard ship). It should be very close to the magnetic bearing. The difference between a magnetic bearing and a compass bearing is the deviation caused to the compass by ferrous metals and local magnetic fields generated by any variety of vehicle or shipboard sources (steel vehicle bodies/frames or vessel hulls, ignition systems, etc.)

===Relative===
In nautical navigation the relative bearing of an object is the clockwise angle from the heading of the vessel to a straight line drawn from the observation station on the vessel to the object.

The relative bearing is measured with a pelorus or other optical and electronic aids to navigation such as a periscope, sonar system, and radar systems. Since World War II, relative bearings of such diverse point sources have been and are calibrated carefully to one another. The United States Navy operates a special range off Puerto Rico and another on the west coast to perform such systems integration. Relative bearings then serve as the baseline data for converting relative directional data into true bearings (N-S-E-W, relative to the Earth&#x27;s true geography). By contrast, Compass bearings have a varying error factor at differing locations about the globe, and are less reliable than the compensated or true bearings.

The measurement of relative bearings of fixed landmarks and other navigational aids is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the nautical chart together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the vessel&#x27;s position, speed, course, etc.

The measurement of relative bearings of other vessels and objects in movement is useful to the navigator in avoiding the danger of collision. For example:

* The navigator on a ship observes a lighthouse when its relative bearing is 45° and again when it is 90°. He now knows that the distance from the ship to the lighthouse is equal to the distance travelled by the vessel between both observations.
* The pilot of a boat observes that the relative bearing of another boat is less than 180° and decreasing (that is, it is now closer to dead ahead than before). He now knows he will pass astern of the other boat. If the bearing were to remain constant, the two boats would be on a collision course.

==Examples==
; Piloting
: A bearing can be taken on another vessel to aid piloting. If the two vessels are travelling towards each other and the relative bearing remains the same over time, there is likelihood of collision and action needs to be taken by one or both vessels to prevent this from happening.

; Warfare
A bearing can be taken to a fixed or moving object in order to target it with gunfire or missiles. This is mainly used by ground troops when planning on using an air-strike on the target.

; Search and rescue
: A bearing can be taken to a person or vessel in distress in order to go to their aid.

==Usages==

There are several methods used to measure navigation bearings including:
#In land navigation, a &#x27;bearing&#x27; is ordinarily calculated in a clockwise direction starting from a reference direction of 0° and increasing to 359.9 degrees. Measured in this way, a bearing is referred to as an &quot;azimuth&quot; by the US Army but not by armies in other English speaking nations, which use the term bearing. If the reference direction is north (either true north, magnetic north, or grid north), the bearing is termed an &quot;absolute bearing&quot;. In a contemporary land navigation context, true, magnetic, and grid bearings are always measured in this way, with true north, magnetic north, or grid north being 0° in a 360-degree system.
#In aircraft navigation, an angle is normally measured from the aircraft&#x27;s track or heading, in a clockwise direction. If the aircraft encounters a target that is not ahead of the aircraft and not on an identical track, then the angular bearing to that target is called a &quot;relative bearing&quot;.
#In marine navigation, starboard bearings are &#x27;green&#x27; and port bearings are &#x27;red&#x27;. Thus, in ship navigation, a target directly off the starboard side would be &#x27;Green090&#x27; or &#x27;G090&#x27;. This method is only used for a &quot;relative bearing&quot;. A navigator on watch does not always have a corrected compass available with which to give an accurate bearing. If available, the bearing might not be numerate. Therefore, every forty-five degrees of direction from north on the compass was divided into four &#x27;points&#x27;. Thus, 32 points of 11.25° each makes a circle of 360°. An object at 022.5° relative would be &#x27;two points off the starboard bow&#x27;, an object at 101.25° relative would be &#x27;one point abaft the starboard beam&#x27; and an object at 213.75° relative would be &#x27;three points on the port quarter&#x27;. This method is only used for a &quot;relative bearing&quot;.
#An informal method of measuring a &quot;relative bearing&quot; is by using the &#x27;clock method&#x27;. In this method, the direction a vessel, aircraft or object is measured as if a clock face is laid over the vessel or aircraft, with the number twelve pointing forward. Something straight ahead is at &#x27;twelve o&#x27;clock&#x27;, while something directly off to the right is at &#x27;three o&#x27;clock&#x27;. This method is only used for a relative bearing.
#In land surveying, a bearing is the clockwise or counterclockwise angle between north or south and a direction. For example, bearings are recorded as N57°E, S51°E, S21°W, N87°W, or N15°W. In surveying, bearings can be referenced to true north, magnetic north, grid north (the Y axis of a map projection), or a previous map, which is often a historical magnetic north.
#If navigating by gyrocompass, the reference direction is true north, in which case the terms &quot;true bearing&quot; and &quot; geodetic bearing&quot; are used. 
#In stellar navigation, the reference direction is that of the North Star, Polaris. 
#In satellite broadcasting, a bearing is the combination of antenna azimuth and elevation required to point (aim) a satellite dish antenna in a given direction. The bearing for geostationary satellites is constant. The bearing for polar-orbiting satellites varies continuously.
==Arcs==
Moving from A to B along a great circle can be considered as always going in the same direction (the direction of B), such as when holding fixed a steering wheel or ship&#x27;s wheel. However, following a great circle does keep the same bearing, which applies when following a rhumb line. Accordingly, the direction at A of B, expressed as a bearing, is not in general the opposite of the direction at B of A (when traveling on the great circle formed by A and B); see inverse geodetic problem. For example, assume A and B in the northern hemisphere have the same latitude, and at A the direction to B is east-northeast. Then going from A to B, one arrives at B with the direction east-southeast, and conversely, the direction at B of A is west-northwest.

To &quot;keep to a bearing&quot; is not, in general, the same as going in a fixed direction along a great circle. Conversely, one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change. Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South. When travelling East or West, it is only on the Equator that one can keep East or West and be going straight (without the need to adjust). Anywhere else, maintaining latitude requires a change in direction, requires adjustment. This change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to a lower latitude.

<text>A bearing is a machine element that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion and reduces friction between moving parts. The design of the bearing may, for example, provide for free linear movement of the moving part or for free rotation around a fixed axis; or, it may prevent a motion by controlling the vectors of normal forces that bear on the moving parts. Most bearings facilitate the desired motion by minimizing friction. Bearings are classified broadly according to the type of operation, the motions allowed, or the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts.

The term &quot;bearing&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;&quot;; a bearing being a machine element that allows one part to bear (i.e., to support) another. The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, roughness, and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices installed into a machine or machine part. The most sophisticated bearings for the most demanding applications are very precise components; their manufacture requires some of the highest standards of current technology.

==Types of bearings==
Rotary bearings hold rotating components such as shafts or axles within mechanical systems and transfer axial and radial loads from the source of the load to the structure supporting it. The simplest form of bearing, the &quot;plain bearing&quot;, consists of a shaft rotating in a hole. Lubrication is used to reduce friction. Lubricants come in different forms, including liquids, solids, and gases. The choice of lubricant depends on the specific application and factors such as temperature, load, and speed. In the &quot;ball bearing&quot; and &quot;roller bearing&quot;, to reduce sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability, and performance.

== History ==

It is sometimes assumed that the invention of the rolling bearing, in the form of wooden rollers supporting– or bearing –an object being moved, predates the invention of a wheel rotating on a plain bearing; this underlies speculation that cultures such as the Ancient Egyptians used roller bearings in the form of tree trunks under sleds. There is no evidence for this sequence of technological development. The Egyptians&#x27; own drawings in the tomb of Djehutihotep show the process of moving massive stone blocks on sledges as using liquid-lubricated runners which would constitute plain bearings. There are also Egyptian drawings of plain bearings used with hand drills.

Wheeled vehicles using plain bearings emerged between about 5000 BC and 3000 BC.

A recovered example of an early rolling-element bearing is a wooden ball bearing supporting a rotating table from the remains of the Roman Nemi ships in Lake Nemi, Italy. The wrecks were dated to 40 BC.

Leonardo da Vinci incorporated drawings of ball bearings in his design for a helicopter around the year 1500; this is the first recorded use of bearings in an aerospace design. However, Agostino Ramelli is the first to have published roller and thrust bearings sketches. An issue with the ball and roller bearings is that the balls or rollers rub against each other, causing additional friction. This can be reduced by enclosing each individual ball or roller within a cage. The captured, or caged, ball bearing was originally described by Galileo in the 17th century.

The first practical caged-roller bearing was invented in the mid-1740s by horologist John Harrison for his H3 marine timekeeper. In this timepiece, the caged bearing was only used for a very limited oscillating motion, but later on, Harrison applied a similar bearing design with a true rotational movement in a contemporaneous regulator clock.

The first patent on ball bearings was awarded to Philip Vaughan, a British inventor and ironmaster in Carmarthen in 1794. His was the first modern ball-bearing design, with the ball running along a groove in the axle assembly.

Bearings played a pivotal role in the nascent Industrial Revolution, allowing the new industrial machinery to operate efficiently. For example, they were used for holding wheel and axle assemblies to greatly reduce friction compared to prior non-bearing designs.

The first patent for a radial-style ball bearing was awarded to Jules Suriray, a Parisian bicycle mechanic, on 3 August 1869. The bearings were then fitted to the winning bicycle ridden by James Moore in the world&#x27;s first bicycle road race, Paris-Rouen, in November 1869.

In 1883, Friedrich Fischer, founder of FAG, developed an approach for milling and grinding balls of equal size and exact roundness by means of a suitable production machine, which set the stage for the creation of an independent bearing industry. His hometown Schweinfurt later became a world-leading center for ball bearing production.

The modern, self-aligning design of ball bearing is attributed to Sven Wingquist of the SKF ball-bearing manufacturer in 1907 when he was awarded Swedish patent No. 25406 on its design.

Henry Timken, a 19th-century visionary and innovator in carriage manufacturing, patented the tapered roller bearing in 1898. The following year he formed a company to produce his innovation. Over a century, the company grew to make bearings of all types, including specialty steel bearings and an array of related products and services.

Erich Franke invented and patented the wire race bearing in 1934. His focus was on a bearing design with a cross-section as small as possible and which could be integrated into the enclosing design. After World War II, he founded with Gerhard Heydrich the company Franke &amp; Heydrich KG (today Franke GmbH) to push the development and production of wire race bearings.

Richard Stribeck&#x27;s extensive research on ball bearing steels identified the metallurgy of the commonly used 100Cr6 (AISI 52100), showing coefficient of friction as a function of pressure.

Designed in 1968 and later patented in 1972, Bishop-Wisecarver&#x27;s co-founder Bud Wisecarver created vee groove bearing guide wheels, a type of linear motion bearing consisting of both an external and internal 90-degree vee angle.

In the early 1980s, Pacific Bearing&#x27;s founder, Robert Schroeder, invented the first bi-material plain bearing that was interchangeable with linear ball bearings. This bearing had a metal shell (aluminum, steel or stainless steel) and a layer of Teflon-based material connected by a thin adhesive layer.

Today&#x27;s ball and roller bearings are used in many applications, which include a rotating component. Examples include ultra high-speed bearings in dental drills, aerospace bearings in the Mars Rover, gearbox and wheel bearings on automobiles, flexure bearings in optical alignment systems, and air bearings used in coordinate-measuring machines.

== Design ==

=== Motions ===

Common motions permitted by bearings are:
* Radial rotation, e.g. shaft rotation;
* Linear motion, e.g. drawer;
* Spherical rotation, e.g. ball and socket joint;
* Hinge motion, e.g. door, elbow, knee.

=== Materials ===

The first plain and rolling-element bearings were wood, closely followed by bronze. Over their history, bearings have been made of many materials, including ceramic, sapphire, glass, steel, bronze, and other metals. Plastic bearings made of nylon, polyoxymethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and UHMWPE, among other materials, are also in use today.

Watchmakers produce &quot;jeweled&quot; watches using sapphire plain bearings to reduce friction, thus allowing more precise timekeeping.

Even basic materials can have impressive durability. Wooden bearings, for instance, can still be seen today in old clocks or in water mills where the water provides cooling and lubrication.

== Types ==
By far, the most common bearing is the plain bearing, a bearing that uses surfaces in rubbing contact, often with a lubricant such as oil or graphite. A plain bearing may or may not be a device. It may be nothing more than the bearing surface of a hole with a shaft passing through it, or of a planar surface that another (in these cases, not a discrete device); or it may be a layer of bearing metal either fused to the substrate (semi-discrete) or in the form of a separable sleeve (discrete). With suitable lubrication, plain bearings often give acceptable accuracy, life, and friction at minimal cost. Therefore, they are very widely used.

However, there are many applications where a more suitable bearing can improve efficiency, accuracy, service intervals, reliability, speed of operation, size, weight, and costs of purchasing and operating machinery.

Thus, many types of bearings have varying shapes, materials, lubrication, principle of operation, and so on.

There are at least 6 common types of bearing, each of which operates on a different principle:

* Plain bearing, consisting of a shaft rotating in a hole. There are several specific styles: bushing, journal bearing, sleeve bearing, rifle bearing, composite bearing;
* Rolling-element bearings, whose performance does not depend on avoiding or reducing friction between two surfaces but employs a different principle to achieve low external friction: the rolling motion of an intermediate element in between the surfaces which bear the axial or radial load. Classified as either:
** Ball bearing, in which the rolling elements are spherical balls;
** Roller bearing, in which the rolling elements are cylindrical rollers, linearly-tapered (conical) rollers, rollers with a curved taper (such as so-called spherical rollers), or gears;
* Jewel bearing, a plain bearing in which one of the bearing surfaces is made of an ultrahard glassy jewel material such as sapphire to reduce friction and wear;
* Fluid bearing, a noncontact bearing in which the load is supported by a gas or liquid (i.e. air bearing);
* Magnetic bearing, in which the load is supported by a magnetic field;
* Flexure bearing, in which the motion is supported by a load element which bends.

The following table summarizes the notable characteristics of each of these bearing types.

== Characteristics ==
=== Friction ===

Reducing friction in bearings is often important for efficiency, to reduce wear and to facilitate extended use at high speeds and to avoid overheating and premature failure of the bearing. Essentially, a bearing can reduce friction by virtue of its shape, by its material, or by introducing and containing a fluid between surfaces or by separating the surfaces with an electromagnetic field.
* Shape: gains advantage usually by using spheres or rollers, or by forming flexure bearings.
* Material: exploits the nature of the bearing material used. (An example would be using plastics that have low surface friction.)
* Fluid: exploits the low viscosity of a layer of fluid, such as a lubricant or as a pressurized medium to keep the two solid parts from touching, or by reducing the normal force between them.
* Fields: exploits electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic fields, to keep solid parts from touching.
* Air pressure: exploits air pressure to keep solid parts from touching.

Combinations of these can even be employed within the same bearing. An example is where the cage is made of plastic, and it separates the rollers/balls, which reduce friction by their shape and finish.

=== Loads ===

Bearing design varies depending on the size and directions of the forces required to support. Forces can be predominately radial, axial (thrust bearings), or bending moments perpendicular to the main axis.

=== Speeds ===

Different bearing types have different operating speed limits. Speed is typically specified as maximum relative surface speeds, often specified ft/s or m/s. Rotational bearings typically describe performance in terms of the product &quot;DN&quot; where &quot;D&quot; is the mean diameter (often in mm) of the bearing and &quot;N&quot; is the rotation rate in revolutions per minute.

Generally, there is considerable speed range overlap between bearing types. Plain bearings typically handle only lower speeds, rolling element bearings are faster, followed by fluid bearings and finally magnetic bearings which are limited ultimately by centripetal force overcoming material strength.

=== Play ===

Some applications apply bearing loads from varying directions and accept only limited play or &quot;slop&quot; as the applied load changes. One source of motion is gaps or &quot;play&quot; in the bearing. For example, a 10 mm shaft in a 12 mm hole has 2 mm play.

Allowable play varies greatly depending on the use. As an example, a wheelbarrow wheel supports radial and axial loads. Axial loads may be hundreds of newtons force left or right, and it is typically acceptable for the wheel to wobble by as much as 10 mm under the varying load. In contrast, a lathe may position a cutting tool to ±0.002 mm using a ball lead screw held by rotating bearings. The bearings support axial loads of thousands of newtons in either direction and must hold the ball lead screw to ±0.002 mm across that range of loads

=== Stiffness ===

Stiffness is the amount that the gap varies when the load on the bearing changes, distinct from the friction of the bearing.

A second source of motion is elasticity in the bearing itself. For example, the balls in a ball bearing are like stiff rubber and under load deform from a round to a slightly flattened shape. The race is also elastic and develops a slight dent where the ball presses on it.

The stiffness of a bearing is how the distance between the parts separated by the bearing varies with the applied load. With rolling element bearings, this is due to the strain of the ball and race. With fluid bearings, it is due to how the pressure of the fluid varies with the gap (when correctly loaded, fluid bearings are typically stiffer than rolling element bearings).

== Lubrication ==

Some bearings use a thick grease for lubrication, which is pushed into the gaps between the bearing surfaces, also known as &quot;packing&quot;. The grease is held in place by a plastic, leather, or rubber gasket (also called a &quot;gland&quot;) that covers the inside and outside edges of the bearing race to keep the grease from escaping. Bearings may also be packed with other materials. Historically, the wheels on railroad cars used sleeve bearings packed with &quot;waste&quot; or loose scraps of cotton or wool fiber soaked in oil, then later used solid pads of cotton.

Bearings can be lubricated by a ring oiler, a metal ring that rides loosely on the central rotating shaft of the bearing. The ring hangs down into a chamber containing lubricating oil. As the bearing rotates, viscous adhesion draws oil up the ring and onto the shaft, where the oil migrates into the bearing to lubricate it. Excess oil is flung off and collects in the pool again.

A rudimentary form of lubrication is splash lubrication. Some machines contain a pool of lubricant in the bottom, with gears partially immersed in the liquid, or crank rods that can swing down into the pool as the device operates. The spinning wheels fling oil into the air around them, while the crank rods slap at the surface of the oil, splashing it randomly on the engine&#x27;s interior surfaces. Some small internal combustion engines specifically contain special plastic &quot;flinger wheels&quot; which randomly scatter oil around the interior of the mechanism.

For high-speed and high-power machines, a loss of lubricant can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also, in dirty environments, the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris, increasing friction. In these applications, a fresh supply of lubricant can be continuously supplied to the bearing and all other contact surfaces, and the excess can be collected for filtration, cooling, and possibly reuse. Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex internal combustion engines in parts of the engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies. High-speed turbochargers also typically require a pressurized oil system to cool the bearings and keep them from burning up due to the heat from the turbine.

Composite bearings are designed with a self-lubricating polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) liner with a laminated metal backing. The PTFE liner offers consistent, controlled friction as well as durability, whilst the metal backing ensures the composite bearing is robust and capable of withstanding high loads and stresses throughout its long life. Its design also makes it lightweight-one tenth the weight of a traditional rolling element bearing.

== Mounting ==

There are many methods of mounting bearings, usually involving an interference fit. When press fitting or shrink fitting a bearing into a bore or onto a shaft, it&#x27;s important to keep the housing bore and shaft outer diameter to very close limits, which can involve one or more counterboring operations, several facing operations, and drilling, tapping, and threading operations. Alternatively, an interference fit can also be achieved with the addition of a tolerance ring.

== Service life ==
The service life of the bearing is affected by many factors not controlled by the bearing manufacturers. For example, bearing mounting, temperature, exposure to external environment, lubricant cleanliness, and electrical currents through bearings. High frequency PWM inverters can induce electric currents in a bearing, which can be suppressed by the use of ferrite chokes. The temperature and terrain of the micro-surface will determine the amount of friction by touching solid parts. Certain elements and fields reduce friction while increasing speeds. Strength and mobility help determine the load the bearing type can carry. Alignment factors can play a damaging role in wear and tear, yet overcome by computer aid signaling and non-rubbing bearing types, such as magnetic levitation or air field pressure.

Fluid and magnetic bearings can have practically indefinite service lives. In practice, fluid bearings support high loads in hydroelectric plants that have been in nearly continuous service since about 1900 and show no signs of wear.

Rolling element bearing life is determined by load, temperature, maintenance, lubrication, material defects, contamination, handling, installation and other factors. These factors can all have a significant effect on bearing life. For example, the service life of bearings in one application was extended dramatically by changing how the bearings were stored before installation and use, as vibrations during storage caused lubricant failure even when the only load on the bearing was its own weight; the resulting damage is often false brinelling. Bearing life is statistical: several samples of a given bearing will often exhibit a bell curve of service life, with a few samples showing significantly better or worse life. Bearing life varies because microscopic structure and contamination vary greatly even where macroscopically they seem identical.

Bearings are often specified to give an &quot;L10&quot; (US) or &quot;B10&quot; (elsewhere) life, the duration by which ten percent of the bearings in that application can be expected to have failed due to classical fatigue failure (and not any other mode of failure such as lubrication starvation, wrong mounting etc.), or, alternatively, the duration at which ninety percent will still be operating. The L10/B10 life of the bearing is theoretical, and may not represent service life of the bearing. Bearings are also rated using the C0 (static loading) value. This is the basic load rating as a reference, and not an actual load value.

For plain bearings, some materials give a much longer life than others. Some of the John Harrison clocks still operate after hundreds of years because of the &quot;lignum vitae&quot; wood employed in their construction, whereas his metal clocks are seldom run due to potential wear.

Flexure bearings rely on elastic properties of a material. Flexure bearings bend a piece of material repeatedly. Some materials fail after repeated bending, even at low loads, but careful material selection and bearing design can make flexure bearing life indefinite.

Although long bearing life is often desirable, it is sometimes not necessary. describes a bearing for a rocket motor oxygen pump that gave several hours life, far in excess of the several tens of minutes needed.

Depending on the customized specifications (backing material and PTFE compounds), composite bearings can operate up to 30 years without maintenance.

For bearings which are used in oscillating applications, customized approaches to calculate L10/B10 are used.

Many bearings require periodic maintenance to prevent premature failure, but others require little maintenance. The latter include various kinds of polymer, fluid and magnetic bearings, as well as rolling-element bearings that are described with terms including &quot;sealed bearing&quot; and &quot;sealed for life&quot;. These contain seals to keep the dirt out and the grease in. They work successfully in many applications, providing maintenance-free operation. Some applications cannot use them effectively.

Nonsealed bearings often have a grease fitting, for periodic lubrication with a grease gun, or an oil cup for periodic filling with oil. Before the 1970s, sealed bearings were not encountered on most machinery, and oiling and greasing were a more common activity than they are today. For example, automotive chassis used to require &quot;lube jobs&quot; nearly as often as engine oil changes, but today&#x27;s car chassis are mostly sealed for life. From the late 1700s through the mid-1900s, industry relied on many workers called oilers to lubricate machinery frequently with oil cans.

Factory machines today usually have &quot;lube systems&quot;, in which a central pump serves periodic charges of oil or grease from a reservoir through &quot;lube lines&quot; to the various &quot;lube points&quot; in the machine&#x27;s bearing surfaces, bearing journals, pillow blocks, and so on. The timing and number of such &quot;lube cycles&quot; is controlled by the machine&#x27;s computerized control, such as PLC or CNC, as well as by manual override functions when occasionally needed. This automated process is how all modern CNC machine tools and many other factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a hand pump that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called &quot;one-shot systems&quot; from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.

The oiling system inside a modern automotive or truck engine is similar in concept to the lube systems mentioned above, except that oil is pumped continuously. Much of this oil flows through passages drilled or cast into the engine block and cylinder heads, escaping through ports directly onto bearings and squirting elsewhere to provide an oil bath. The oil pump simply pumps constantly, and any excess pumped oil continuously escapes through a relief valve back into the sump.

Many bearings in high-cycle industrial operations need periodic lubrication and cleaning, and many require occasional adjustment, such as pre-load adjustment, to minimize the effects of wear.

Bearing life is often much better when the bearing is kept clean and well-lubricated. However, many applications make good maintenance difficult. One example is bearings in the conveyor of a rock crusher are exposed continually to hard abrasive particles. Cleaning is of little use because cleaning is expensive, yet the bearing is contaminated again as soon as the conveyor resumes operation. Thus, a good maintenance program might lubricate the bearings frequently but not include any disassembly for cleaning. The frequent lubrication, by its nature, provides a limited kind of cleaning action by displacing older (grit-filled) oil or grease with a fresh charge, which itself collects grit before being displaced by the next cycle. Another example are bearings in wind turbines, which makes maintenance difficult since the nacelle is placed high up in the air in strong wind areas. In addition, the turbine does not always run and is subjected to different operating behavior in different weather conditions, which makes proper lubrication a challenge.

<doc id="221431" wikidata="Q2860082" url="?curid=221431" title="Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford">
<text>Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford, (1 August 1776 – 27 March 1849), styled The Honourable Archibald Acheson from 1790 to 1806 and Lord Acheson from 1806 to 1807, was a British politician who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada and Governor General of British North America in the 19th century.

==Early life==
Acheson was born on 1 August 1776 at Markethill, County Armagh, Ireland. Gosford was the son of Arthur Acheson, 1st Earl of Gosford, and his wife Millicent (née Pole). He succeeded his father to his titles and estates in 1807.

==Career==

Acheson sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Armagh from 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801, when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom. Subsequently, he was a Member of the British House of Commons representing Armagh to 1807, when he succeeded to his father&#x27;s Irish titles as Earl of Gosford. He entered the British House of Lords in 1811 upon being elected an Irish representative peer.

In 1831 he was appointed the first Lord Lieutenant of Armagh for life, having previously been a Governor of Armagh since 1805. The new position incorporated the post of Custos Rotulorum of County Armagh which he also already held. He was created Baron Worlingham in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1835 and thus became a member of the UK House of Lords in his own right. He commissioned Thomas Hopper (1776–1856) to design a new house, Gosford Castle on his Gosford estate. The house would not be completed until after his death.

In 1835, he became Governor General of British North America (also Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada), and commissioner in the Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty&#x27;s Subjects of Lower Canada. He was instructed to appease the reformists, led by Louis-Joseph Papineau, without giving them any real power. Gosford attempted to distance himself from his predecessor, Lord Aylmer, who had exacerbated the hostility of French-Canadians to the British administration. Gosford officially established the Diocese of Montreal in 1836, though it had been unofficially created a few years before. In August of that year Gosford dissolved the Legislative Assembly when they refused to pass his budget.

In November, Lord Gosford learned of the planned Lower Canada Rebellion and had many of Papineau&#x27;s followers arrested, although Papineau himself escaped to the United States. The next month, he issued a reward for the capture of Papineau, and declared martial law in Lower Canada.

Lord Gosford resigned in November 1837 and returned to Britain the next year. Lord Durham, was appointed Governor General in 1838. He produced the Durham Report which recommended that Lower Canada and Upper Canada be reunited, with responsible government, which Lord Gosford had unsuccessfully argued against.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Sparrow, the daughter and heiress of Robert Sparrow of Worlingham Hall, Suffolk, with whom he had a son and four daughters.

*Archibald Acheson, 3rd Earl of Gosford (20 August 1806 – 15 June 1864), he succeeded his father upon his death.
*Lady Mary Acheson (27 June 1809 – 13 March 1850). On 9 July 1835 she married James Hewitt, 4th Viscount Lifford. They had four sons, and four daughters.
* Lady Millicent French Acheson (circa 1812 – 29 August 1887). She married Henry Bence Jones on 28 May 1842. They had three sons, and four daughters. The youngest son, Archibald, married a daughter of Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow.

Lord Gosford died in 1849.

===Legacy===
It is believed the city of Gosford in New South Wales, Australia was named after him, the Governor of New South Wales having served with him in Canada.

<text>A Europhile is a person who is fond of, admires, or loves European culture, society, history, food, music etc. In its narrower, and often pejorative sense, the term europhile is most often used in Europe itself in a political context, that is, in the context of an uncritical attitude towards the European Union. It refers to organizations and individuals with explicitly unquestioning pro-European attitudes, as opposed to Eurosceptics and Europhobes.

<doc id="221433" wikidata="Q290738" url="?curid=221433" title="Trent–Severn Waterway">
<text>The Trent–Severn Waterway is a canal route connecting Lake Ontario at Trenton to Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, at Port Severn. Its major natural waterways include the Trent River, Otonabee River, Kawartha Lakes, Lake Simcoe, Lake Couchiching and Severn River. Its scenic, meandering route has been called &quot;one of the finest interconnected systems of navigation in the world&quot;.

The canal was surveyed as a military route, but the first lock was built in 1833 as a commercial venture. This connected a number of lakes and rivers near the centre of the waterway, opening a large area to navigation by steamship. The government had begun construction of three additional locks when the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 broke out. This led the government to re-examine the project, concluding that the route would have too many locks to allow rapid movement for military purposes. They decided that the locks under construction would be completed, but the rest could be turned into timber slides. This left the completed inland section with no outlet, which business interests addressed by connecting to the route with a number of new toll roads, plank roads, and later, railways.

John A. Macdonald&#x27;s government restarted construction in the 1880s, adding a number of new locks and pushing the route westward before construction once again halted. For many years after this, the canal was used as a political tool to garner votes from areas along the route, with little construction being carried out. It was not until just before the turn of the century that a number of political changes built up incredible pressure on Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals and serious work started once again. The canal reached Peterborough and Lake Simcoe in 1904. The final sections were greatly delayed by World War I, with the link to Trenton opening in 1918, followed by the link to Georgian Bay in early 1920. The first complete transit of the waterway was made in July of that year.

By the time the route was completed, its usefulness as a commercial waterway was over; ships plying the Great Lakes had grown much larger than the canal could handle, and the railways that had connected to the canal now took most of its freight. But the introduction of motor boats found the Trent–Severn perfectly positioned as a pleasure boating route, and today it is one of Ontario&#x27;s major tourist attractions. Its passage through cottage country, both Muskoka in the west and the Kawarthas in the east, draws thousands of visitors every year. It also forms a major portion of the Great Loop. Today it is officially organized as a National Historic Site of Canada linear park operated by Parks Canada It is open for navigation from May until October, while its shore lands and bridges are open year-round.

==Geography==
The total length of the waterway is , beginning at Trenton, Ontario, with roughly of man-made channels. There are 44 locks, including 37 conventional locks, two sets of flight locks, hydraulic lift locks at Peterborough and Kirkfield, and a marine railway at Big Chute which transports boats between the upper and lower sections of the Severn. The system also includes 39 swing bridges and 160 dams and control structures that manage the water levels for flood control and navigation on lakes and rivers that drain approximately of central Ontario&#x27;s cottage country region, across four counties and three single-tier cities, an area that is home to more than a million Canadians.

It reaches its highest point of at Balsam Lake, the highest point to which a vessel can be navigated from sea level in the Great Lakes–Saint Lawrence River drainage basin. The navigable summit of the Monongahela River (part of the Mississippi River drainage basin) at Fairmont, West Virginia is, at , the highest point in North America (the summit of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal at its highest point of is higher still).

The Trent–Severn Waterway is managed by Parks Canada under the statutory authority of the Historic Canals Regulations (which outline and delegate the responsibilities for navigation, resource protection, dredge and fill operations, the operation of boater campgrounds, etc.). The navigation corridor includes over of shoreline and over of water. More than private and commercial properties abut the navigation corridor of the Trent–Severn Waterway. The Trent–Severn Waterway also has regulatory responsibility and authority under the Dominion Water Power Act for the 18 hydroelectric generating facilities located along its route.

==History==

Samuel de Champlain was the first European to travel the network of inland waters from Georgian Bay to the Bay of Quinte with the Hurons in 1615. It was this same route that would later be canalized and become the Trent–Severn Waterway.

===Military origins===
The desire for a communications route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron had been a topic of discussion as early as 1785, and gained new importance with the opening of the War of the First Coalition in 1793. Had the newly formed United States entered the conflict on the side of their French allies, they could have cut access to the upper great lakes at Detroit or Lake St. Clair. This would have denied waterborne access to the important British trading post at Michilimackinac.

To solve this problem, John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, began construction of Yonge Street and the Penetanguishene Road to provide an overland portage route to Georgian Bay via Lake Simcoe that would bypass these choke points. Construction of Yonge began in 1794, reaching today&#x27;s Holland Landing in 1796. However, the road was not passable for much of its length until 1816, and the entire route to Georgian Bay some time after that. The route was used for its original military purpose sparingly during the War of 1812, primarily to ship supplies to a naval depot built at Holland Landing. Its rough location is marked today by a large anchor that was being shipped from Chatham, England to Wasaga Beach (then known as Schooner Town), but was abandoned in Holland Landing when the war ended.

The lack of convenient access to the upper lakes demonstrated by the war led to new calls for inland waterways for military use, and led to the construction of a number of canals to provide rapid access to the Upper Canada area. These included canals at Grenville, Chute-à-Blondeau and Carillon Canals, all along the Ottawa River, as well as the most ambitious of them all, the -long Rideau Canal from today&#x27;s Ottawa to Kingston. Together, they connected Montreal, Ottawa and Lake Ontario, bypassing significant hazards along the Saint Lawrence River and long stretches of open water on Lake Ontario.

The need for a similar route bypassing Yonge Street and providing access to the upper lakes remained an issue, and several surveys in the area were carried out between 1815 and 1827. Prominent among these was a survey made by Catty in 1819, which concluded that no reasonable alternative to the Trent River was obvious on the eastern end of the route. Unfortunately, its circuitous route ran to Rice Lake before ending up only from the shores of Lake Ontario. Further, the Imperial government&#x27;s interest was tempered by the cost of the Rideau, originally budgeted at $2,370,000 but eventually costing more than $4 million by the time it opened in 1832. Several attempts to raise the funds for the Trent system using local sources, including a proposed lottery, all failed and the plans remained dormant.

===Bethune&#x27;s lock===
James Gray Bethune was a businessman in the port town of Cobourg with a steamship company working Lake Ontario. He was skeptical that the Trent connection would ever be built, but he felt that the inland sections north of Peterborough still offered considerable commercial prospects. The problem of connecting to Lake Ontario could be solved by other means. Bethune, a major player in local politics, led efforts to build a railway from Coburg, which would either have to route around Rice Lake through other counties, or build directly over it. Port Hope, a short distance to the west and a major competitor for Coburg&#x27;s shipping traffic, proposed both a road and a canal. Port Hope&#x27;s location at the western end of Rice Lake placed them slightly closer to the lake than Coburg, and offered a direct land route to Peterborough around the western tip of the lake while remaining within their Northumberland County.

By 1832, Bethune had completed his first plan for a combined canal and rail network. This would start in Coburg and run via railway to Sully (today known as Harwood), where it would connect to steamers on Rice Lake. These would cross the lake to the Otonabee River, providing access to southern Peterborough. Here they could transship via stagecoach to Bridgenorth on Lake Chemong. Locks at Purdy&#x27;s Mill (today&#x27;s Lindsay) and Bobcaygeon would provide access to an extended area including Pigeon Lake, Stony Lake, Sturgeon Lake and Lake Scugog, known collectively as the Back Lakes (today known as &quot;the Kawarthas&quot;).

Bethune launched the &quot;Pemedash&quot; on Rice Lake in 1832, providing daily service between Peterborough and Coburg. The boat was a flat-bottomed design able to travel in shallow waters, more a powered barge than passenger steamer. It had side-wheels and was powered by what one passenger called a &quot;feeble eighteen-horsepower engine&quot;. Catharine Parr Traill called it &quot;a poor excuse for a steamboat&quot; when her family used it in late summer 1832. A second steamer of the same design was built in Peterborough, sawn in half, carried overload to Bridgenorth and launched as the &quot;Sturgeon&quot; on 5 September 1833. Both steamers proved popular; in the less than three months the lakes were open to traffic in its first year of operation, the &quot;Sturgeon&quot; made 61 trips, delivering 60 barrels of pork and 55 tons of other cargo.

A group organized by Bethune met on 1 June 1833 to review tenders for the construction of a series of locks on the Back Lakes. However, they received only two tenders, both for the lock at Bobcaygeon. After several additional meetings and a visit to the site, the contract was awarded to Pierce, Dumble and Hoar for a price of $8,000. The company&#x27;s crew arrived on 2 August and began construction immediately. The rest of the season was taken up with basic construction, blasting out the lock from the limestone with blackpowder. When the weather turned cold on 14 November the lock was nowhere near complete, and the contract was extended.

By the time the land thawed in the spring, Bethune was insolvent due to bookkeeping irregularities at his branch of the Bank of Upper Canada in Coburg, likely due to his use of some of these funds for the transport scheme. His steamers were sold off to new owners. In spite of there being no money from Bethune, and that the contract was clearly underbid, Pierce, Dumble, and Hoar decided to continue construction using their own funds. This proved disastrous; the lock was set too high in the rock and could not be filled at low water in the summer, and even when water was available it leaked out faster than it filled. It remained useless for four years.

===Baird&#x27;s survey===
Bethune&#x27;s early efforts inspired others in the area to form plans of their own to build the complete network. Further progress ran afoul of local politics, in particular the fact that the route ran through two counties, Durham and Northumberland. These were represented by a total of three members of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, each with their own ideas of where the southern end of canal should be built. John Brown was the director of the Port Hope Canal Company, while George Strange Boulton of Cobourg was busy forming the Cobourg and Rice Lake Railway with Bethune. Each favoured their own route in Durham, over the complaints of those living in Northumberland who wanted the route to follow the Trent through their county.

Boulton hatched a plan to kill the Trent route by ordering a complete survey of the river, hoping the cost of canalizing it would be far greater than building his railway. After several debates in the Legislature, on 13 February 1833 money was set aside for a survey, contracting Nicol Hugh Baird of Montreal to carry it out. Baird had worked on several canals and other engineering projects around the world, including the Rideau, and was at that time supervising a new bridge over the foot of the Trent that would replace a ferry service. Although the money had been set aside, nothing further occurred for months. This prompted a meeting in Peterborough on 27 August that demanded the work begin, leading to Baird&#x27;s arrival on 7 September. As soon as word was out that he had arrived, citizen&#x27;s groups in the two towns began tit-for-tat exchanges in local newspapers denouncing each other&#x27;s efforts.

Baird&#x27;s report was submitted on 28 November 1833. It placed the cost of making the Trent navigable to Rice Lake at $1,167,236 using 34 locks long and wide, along with 17 dams used to raise water levels in various portions of the route. He predicted it would take four years to complete. The report went on in great length to justify the expense, saying it would pay for itself in tolls, estimated to be $30,000 a year from timber shipments alone. On 6 March 1834, Robert Maigny submitted his estimates for the Port Hope Canal, using 34 locks by at a total cost of $507,130.

===Huron link, expansion===
At this point further work ended while the new Lieutenant Governor, Sir John Colborne, arranged a trip to visit the area. His six-day tour covered most of the lakes and rivers in the system, including the Talbot River that connected the Back Lakes to Lake Simcoe. On his return, taking Bethune&#x27;s route using the &quot;Pemedash&quot; and then stage to York, he reported that he was delighted by his trip. Interpreted as support for further work on the system, this led to a petition calling for a route to connect Lake Simcoe with Rice Lake &quot;by canal or otherwise&quot;. Baird was once again hired to survey this western section of the waterway.

Baird&#x27;s new report was filed in September 1835, calling for another 32 locks and 13 dams, at a price of $1,310,340. Including the work on the Trent, this brought the price of the system as a whole to $2,477,575. Knowing that the legislature would be uninterested in such a proposal, he also outlined an alternative using a mix of water and rail transit, using specially designed barges that could carry a train of cars that would then be switched onto short sections of railway to bypass the trickier sections of the route. The idea was not unlike modern containerized shipping. Using this method, Baird believed that the price would be cut by about $1.5 million, and be completed in only three years. Perhaps believing this suggestion might be accepted, Baird also purchased stock in the Cobourg railway.

At this point the route began to experience pushback from the supporters of the Welland Canal, connecting Lake Ontario to Lake Erie. The Welland was losing money due to competition from the Erie Canal, and the prospect of another competitor to the north was a worrying development. The Ontario Legislature, then in the grip of the Family Compact, had powerful supporters of the Welland block further progress. William Hamilton Merritt, founder of the Welland Canal Company, was willing to support inland locks and even a private canal of the limited size proposed by Port Hope, but staunchly opposed any western extension. This opposition would frustrate further development for many years. With any hope of government backing clearly out of the question, the Port Hope and Rice Lake Canal Company closed down.

Strong support for the inland routes remained among the populace, and to appease these interests the government formed the Inland Water Commission to study the system. As an interim measure, on 3 March 1836 they submitted a new proposal for four locks at a total cost of $80,000. One of these would replace the nonfunctional lock at Bobcaygeon, one in Purdy&#x27;s Mills (Lindsay) would allow transit to Lake Scugog, one at Whitla&#x27;s Rapids (Scott&#x27;s Mills) would allow passage further up the Otonabee in Peterborough, and one at Hastings, east of Rice Lake, would allow partial transit down the Trent. Together they would open of waterway to continual navigation. Most importantly, the report noted that this would allow the iron ore at Marmora to travel west to Rice Lake where it could travel by train to Lake Ontario. This was approved by the legislature on 28 November 1836, while further proposals to improve various other locations were all ignored.

===Hiatus===
In the midst of construction, in 1837 the Upper Canada Rebellion broke out. Although quickly suppressed, the Rebellions of 1837 served to worry the Imperial government enough to appoint John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham to fix the problems. In spite of holding the position of Governor General for only a brief period before resigning, his &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot; was implemented in large part and caused sweeping changes to the government. The newly merged Province of Canada had a single parliament with special rules intended to balance the power of the French and English speaking colonies.

As part of the formation of the new Province, the former Inland Water Commission was moved to the new government&#x27;s Board of Works. The new government broke the power of the Family Compact, and reduced the influence of its French counterpart, the Château Clique. But it also resulted in a body whose decisions often separated along regional lines. By this time a new force had entered the process, central Ontario lumber barons. They used the many rivers of the province to float logs to mills, notably John Rudolphus Booth&#x27;s mill in Ottawa, at that time the largest sawmill in the world. Locks presented a barrier to their rafts, as would any traffic on the rivers, so they were opposed to any further work on the system.

Examining the project, the Board of Works concluded that a route with as many locks as Baird had proposed would take so long to transit that it would not be useful militarily, and thus of little interest to the new federalist government. They agreed to continue construction of the four locks contracted in 1836, largely as a way to employ the many immigrants arriving in the area. They showed little interest in the rest of the route, and agreed to allow the rest of the surveyed lock locations to be turned into timber slides.

===Road and railway connections===
With the completion of the four locks, the Back Lakes were now open to navigation for most of the year. Newly arriving settlers in the area expanded the types of products available. By the 1850s, Peterborough had gristmills, sawmills, carding and fulling mills and a tannery. Meanwhile, logging companies and farmers were setting up all across central Ontario, using the lakes to ship their products. This left the problem of getting these products to market, which in turn led to a small railway rush with the express intent of connecting to the Back Lake navigation. Through the 1850s and &#x27;60s, numerous railways were built to connect at various points.

The first to make the attempt was the long-planned Cobourg and Rice Lake Railway. Having originally been planned in 1831 and chartered in 1834, the Panic of 1837 and Rebellion later that year upset their plans to the point where the company&#x27;s charter lapsed in 1840. Next was the Peterborough and Port Hope Railway (P&amp;PH), the competing plan from Port Hope, which had the advantage of being able to loop around the western edge of Rice Lake to produce an all-land route directly to Peterborough. This so worried Cobourg interests that they hired Baird to plan a road route, and opened the Cobourg Plank Road in 1846. This stymied the P&amp;PH, who decided to reroute their line westward to Beaverton on Lake Simcoe.

The numerous delays meant that there was still no rail connection to the waterway in 1850. The original Cobourg group reorganized as the Cobourg and Peterborough Railway in 1852, this time planning to bridge over Rice Lake and provide direct access to Peterborough. The line opened on 29 December 1854, but suffered from continual damage due to ice that closed the Rice Lake bridge for much of its history. In spite of these problems, the railway provided the long-needed route south, and was one of the most financially successful routes in the area. The good times came to an end when the Port Hope interests, now known as the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway (but soon to be renamed as the Midland Railway of Canada), opened the Millbrook Branch that reached Peterborough on 12 May 1858.

Among the other routes available were another plank road further west from Whitby to Lake Scugog, which offered access to the waterway via the lock at Lindsay. This was the closest point on the network to Toronto, and the town of Prince Albert at its midpoint became the largest grain trading site in Upper Canada. This route, today known as Brock Street in Whitby, was rendered superfluous by the Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Railway (WPP&amp;L), which ran beside it and offered far faster service to Toronto. Other routes connected to points further north, including the Victoria Railway that met the waterway at Fenelon Falls, the Lindsay, Bobcaygeon and Pontypool Railway that met it at Lindsay and Bobcaygeon, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway that met it at the northern tip of Balsam Lake. These had the advantage of running directly into Toronto, avoiding a switch onto the Grand Trunk Railway needed on the WPP&amp;L.

===Confederation and the Trent Valley Canal Association===
Work on the canal system remained stagnant until Confederation in 1867. This turned the Province of Canada&#x27;s government into a federal body, and gave the new province of Ontario&#x27;s government control over construction. Lacking the power of the federal coffers, they could only afford small projects. Between confederation and 1879 they rebuilt the lock at Lindsay, which had been converted to a timber slide, and built new locks at Young&#x27;s Point and Rosedale. These enlarged the continuous area served by the waterway, but still lacked any outlet to the major bodies of water.

Having watched work on the system stagnate for years, in September 1879 a group of Conservative politicians formed the Trent Valley Canal Association to agitate for further work. They were soon joined by Liberals and neutral parties, eventually coming to represent almost every riding from Trenton to Midland. The Toronto &quot;Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;Their activity shows an amount of energy that betokens a body determined to deserve success.&quot; For the next forty years, the Association maintained its pressure on successive governments and never allowed any of them to renege on their agreements to continue work on the system. Their basic concept, agreed to at their first meeting, was to arrange periodic meetings of all the municipal leaders along the route, and collect petitions from their constituents, as well as ask them to write letters directly to their members of Parliament. This quickly produced an almost continual stream of letters.

The concept proved successful, and the government of John A. Macdonald was convinced to provide funding to add new locks at Burleigh Falls, Lovesick Lake, Buckhorn and Fenelon Falls. This greatly expanded the navigable route, from Balsam Lake in the west to Lakefield in the east. In 1881, oversight of the expansion was given to Tom Rubidge of Peterborough. Rubidge had already concluded that the Trent system was essentially useless in comparison to the Sydenham-Killaly proposals to expand navigation on the St. Lawrence, which would be able to carry ships. He felt any work on the Trent at this point was a waste of money and was unhappy to be put in charge of the project. His distaste was further increased when his infant daughter Mary died in 1883 while he was surveying the route. He is noted for his &quot;cussedness&quot; and lack of public relations capability, qualities that dogged his time on the Trent.

Among the most difficult of the sections completed during this period was the locks at Burleigh Falls; Baird had described the &quot;dreaded iron-bound nature of the rock&quot; which required new tools and techniques to beat. The work was finally undertaken by George Goodwin starting in late 1884, using steam powered drills and shovels. It was during this time that one of the most infamous events in the system&#x27;s history took place; at 9:45 a.m. on 4 September 1885 James Simmons and George Morton were hauling a load of dynamite from Tweed to Burleigh Falls when it exploded, leaving behind a wide crater and nothing but bits of horse and man. The site became a brief tourist attraction.

Construction was beset by arguments between Rubidge and the construction team led by Goodwin. From late 1886, Rubidge was under extreme pressure from the press and the politicians along the line, and he became increasingly paranoid, suspicious of everyone involved in the project for their real or imagined attempts to have him removed. He took his anger out on the project as a whole, and especially Goodwin, who began to complain to Rubidge&#x27;s superiors in Ottawa. Rubidge responded by appointing two of his helpers to watch over the construction, harassing Goodwin and his workers continually with a range of problems, even locking up the canoes of the government engineers so they could not get around the sites. Goodwin&#x27;s complaints grew in frequency and anger, and finally he demanded that John Page, the engineer in the Department of Canals and Railways overseeing all canal work, visit the site. This request eventually led to Rubidge&#x27;s removal from the oversight position and his replacement by David Stark, at that time the superintendent of Ottawa River canal projects. Construction was finally completed in 1887, and the first boat passed through the entire section on 26 October.

===Another hiatus, another report===
The federal elections in early 1887 led to Macdonald winning a solid majority in spite of promising nothing to the canal. This cost the Conservatives several seats in the area, but his support of the protectionist National Policy won him many others in the area among businesses that were worried about being flooded by cheap US products. The press was filled with comments to the effect that Macdonald had only been interested in the canal as a vote-getting measure; the Peterborough &quot;Examiner&quot; led the charges, complaining that &quot;Whatever expenditure there had been on the scheme is properly chargeable to the capital (political) account and this is the explanation of all the delay and trifling with this important work.&quot; With every delay the canal became more important to the locals, prompting one long-time Macdonald supporter, Reverend J. Logan, to be quoted saying &quot;Henceforth I have only one politic and that is the Trent Valley Canal.&quot;

Rubidge was still involved in the Trent at this time, having been tasked with producing a survey of the complete route and cost estimates for its completion. After the election, John Page sent Rubidge back to Peterborough to complete this work. Rubidge took the opportunity to return to the worksite and claim he was always in command and had left only for personal reasons. Stark had not yet arrived, and with the work essentially completed by this time, no one seems to have been willing to invest the effort to find out what was going on. When Stark did begin to assert some control, he started by asking one of the other government engineers working with Rubidge, Aylmer, to set up a new office in Peterborough. As he left, Aylmer took the opportunity to break into Rubidge&#x27;s desk and take the now long-overdue survey with him, prompting a break-and-enter charge which Aylmer countered with a libel charge. Another of the government engineers, Fuller, ended up in a fist fight with Rubidge over a property dispute, leading to Fuller&#x27;s conviction on assault and his dismissal from the department.

Looking for any reason to cancel further work, or at least delay it, Macdonald inquired about the status of Rubidge&#x27;s survey. Rubidge promised it would be ready for 20 August, but it never appeared. Stark telegraphed Rubidge on 1 September about it, and Rubidge stated that his fight with Fuller had put it off. It was finally delivered in 15 November. The report closely followed Baird&#x27;s plans completed decades earlier, changing only its ultimate outlet on the west, following the North River to Waubaushene. He placed the cost at $8,684,650, including another 71 locks in addition to the 12 already built or nearing completion, as well as of dug canal. Page added another $1.1 million in ancillary charges like land claims and completion of the work already underway, bringing the total for the entire waterway to $9,984,500. This compares with Baird&#x27;s original estimate of $2.5 million, a number that Stark had personally backed in 1880. This prompted Stark to send in his own estimate, returning to the original Severn route in the west, and calculated the new total to be only $3 million.

This latest controversy was just what Macdonald was waiting for. Pointing out the huge differences in the two estimates, on 8 October 1887 he formed the Trent Valley Canal Commission to study the issue. This was immediately denounced as a measure &quot;to give them an opportunity to get out of the work.&quot; This is precisely what happened; the first meeting of the Commission was not scheduled until 1 April 1888, and the final report was not expected until after the next election. A series of interviews were carried out and questionnaires sent which garnered little response, which the Commission took as evidence that there was little interest in the topic. In 1890 an interim report caused Macdonald to suggest that &quot;Some further enquiry is necessary&quot;. One of the few positive results was a measure of the water supply by the new chief engineer of the Trent, Richard Rogers, that suggested there was a million times more water available than would be needed for the entire route to lock 100 times a day for the 200-day navigation period.

The Commission handed in its final report on 17 December 1890. They accepted Rogers&#x27; calculation of the amount of water available and generally agreed that the routes were possible and even desirable. They also suggested that some of the more complex areas could be greatly simplified by replacing a series of locks with a single hydraulic boat lift, and recommended further study into this option. They also left considerable room for interpretation as to the desirability of completing the works at either end, allowing politicians to pick and chose what sections, if any, they agreed to fund.

===Decision to complete===
By the time the Commission filed their report, parliament was out for the 1891 elections, just what Macdonald had hoped would happen by forming the Commission. As the election continued, it appeared it would be a very close fought result, and Macdonald decided to use the Trent to shore up any seats he could. On 3 March he was personally handed a letter by D.R. Murphy, a Conservative organizer in the Trent area, asking for any help he might provide. Macdonald, ill and bedridden, replied with a telegram stating &quot;Trent Valley Canal Commission have reported favourably on the completion of the scheme. Parliament will be asked next session for a grant for the purpose.&quot; Nine of the thirteen seats in the area were won by Conservatives, reversing their losses from the previous election. Macdonald lived only a short time after the election and suffered a series of strokes that led to his death on 6 June 1891.

In the aftermath of Macdonald&#x27;s death, the Conservatives went through a series of leaders as they lurched from one political disaster to the next. In spite of repeated promises to carry out Macdonald&#x27;s last wishes regarding the canal, nothing had been completed by the time another election began to approach. Then there was a flurry of highly visible surveys carried out, and Rogers was asked to complete detailed plans for further construction. On 22 April 1895 a $475,000 contract was signed for a canal between Balsam Lake and Kirkfield. A second followed on 27 August for the first section from Lakefield to Peterborough. The Peterborough &quot;Examiner&quot; was not amused, asking, &quot;Why have five years, singularly coincident with the general election, been allowed to elapse between the spurts of activity that mark the survey and construction of portions of the canal? Why ... has it been degraded into a vote-catching machine?&quot;

Although the Conservatives attempted to use the Trent to the advantage once again, the attempt failed in Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s strong win in the 1896 election. Having watched the canal hand the Conservatives votes for decades, the new Liberal government immediately cancelled the work. But it was not long before the same political forces that led the Conservatives to support the plan soon found their effect on the Liberals as well, and yet another meeting with the Trent Association and a subsequent visit by George Albert Blair, the newly appointed Minister of Canals and Railways. The Association&#x27;s trump card was the argument that the canal could be a significant shipping route for grain from western Canada, which at that time was having trouble moving eastward due to insufficient capacity in the railway and waterway systems.

But this argument backfired; Blair agreed a canal was needed, but argued instead for a new system along the St. Lawrence. Laurier himself strongly supported railways, especially the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway project. Once again the Association swung into action, bringing over 270 delegates to a meeting on the issue in Ottawa. The Grand Trunk, whose line along the St. Lawrence stood to lose considerable traffic if an alternate shipping route was completed, nevertheless provided train tickets to everyone involved at a reduced fare. The result was a huge crowd of businessmen who descended on Ottawa on 6 April 1897, and began a series of speeches calling for the completion of the Trent. After some time, Laurier himself rose to speak and stated &quot;The government has adopted the completion of the Trent Valley route as part of their policy.&quot; This was met by thunderous applause.

===Opposition from Toronto===
By this time the era of the barge canal as a commercial system was over. The formerly hugely profitable Erie Canal watched traffic dwindle as freight moved to railways, so its operators made it free to use in hopes of maintaining traffic levels and their positive economic effects on the surrounding towns. But this change had little effect, and traffic continued to decline. The chief engineer of New York, who had control over the canal, stated that &quot;canals as a successful and necessary means of transportation have outlived their usefulness.&quot; When a multi-national panel was formed to consider several possible routes to link the upper Great Lakes to the Atlantic, the Trent was not even mentioned.

In the case of the Trent, the railways originally intended to service the waterway now provided an even better transport option. The operators of these railways would compete with any commercial traffic on the canal, and this was especially disconcerting for the grain trade the Trent Association had pitched. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), then stopping at Fort William, were in the midst of completing a link to the Montreal area, as well as building out a network of shorter links in the southern Ontario area that serviced the lake trade. Another railway rush ensued as the Grand Trunk and Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) bought up similar lines, all with the hopes of gaining some part of the rapidly growing grain trade. At the time, almost all of these routes ran through Toronto.

When Laurier made his announcement, the possibility that the Trent would provide any sort of reasonable shipping route in lieu of railways or a canal able to carry oceangoing ships was immediately attacked by business interests in Toronto. When the first $600,000 contract was announced on 31 May 1898, Edmund Osler, member for Toronto West and a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), was the first to oppose it in parliament, stating that the government must have &quot;money to burn.&quot; To the great amusement of the Liberals, other Conservatives from the Trent area then began arguing with Osler. Nevertheless, the government agreed to use the funds released in that budget solely for the completion of existing work, as opposed to expansions. It soon became clear that Laurier&#x27;s government was delaying any further work.

===Laurier completes the system===
Matters changed with the rise of the Liberal&#x27;s new leadership under the direction of Wilfrid Laurier. Prior to the 1896 election the party had strongly supported free trade with the US, known as &quot;reciprocity&quot;, but put this aside for this election and accepted the high-tariff, protectionist National Policy. To support industry, they proposed a wide variety of public works, especially those that took place in Conservative ridings that were subject to swaying. This was the case for all of the Ontario counties involved in the Trent system, and it became a centrepiece of the Ontario strategy. With their election win, in spite of losing the popular vote, the party began the final completion of the Trent system.

At this time, business interests in Port Hope once again argued for completing the route by making a new canal from the western end of Rice Lake south to their town. This would place the exit closer to Toronto and make the route shorter overall. A January 1900 report noted it would add to the route to Montreal, still the ultimate endpoint for overseas shipping, but much more importantly ships would have to travel in the open across Lake Ontario, whereas the Trenton exit was protected. A follow-up report suggested the Trenton route would be cheaper and contracts were sent out for this section, and while several tenders were received, once again the government declined to begin construction.

===Mulock&#x27;s madness===


While this work was ongoing, a side-project began that ultimately brought down the Liberals. William Mulock of Newmarket, a growing industrial and market town north of Toronto, was Laurier&#x27;s right-hand-man in the province. In 1904 the Northern Railway of Canada raised its rates and made several changes that would greatly increase the costs of the industries in the town, so much they claimed it would put them out of business. Mulock hatched a plan to extend the Trent south to the town, an extension officially known as the Holland Subdivision, but universally referred to as the Newmarket Canal.

Critics attacked the concept immediately, pointing out that the economic potential of such a link was nonexistent. But the possibility of bringing federal money to his riding in York North was too good to give up, and Mulock campaigned for it continually, presenting petitions on the part of local residents in favour. However, a survey put the price well over $300,000, a significant amount for such a short link, and was then greatly increased due to changes that appear to have been politically motivated on the part of the Department of Railways and Canals. By the time the plans were complete, the price was approaching $1 million.

In spite of this price, and that Mulock had left the seat in 1905, the party continued to support the project in order to keep the riding in their hands. It became the subject of continual attacks by the Conservatives in the House, and when calculations showed there was too little water to keep it running in the summer, it was heaped with scorn in the press. The party continued to support it throughout, even as it became clear the project was doomed.

The 1911 election brought a swift end to what was by then known as &quot;Mulock&#x27;s madness&quot;. Within days of taking office, Robert Borden ordered a review of the project, and cancelled it shortly thereafter. The remains of the construction, estimated to be 85% complete by that time, were abandoned in place and dot the local landscape to this day. The locals now refer to it as the &quot;ghost canal&quot;.

===Canal today===
Travel was blocked beyond Balsam Lake until the opening of the Kirkfield Lift Lock in 1907.

The lock system aided the development of central Ontario, allowing a quick and efficient flow of goods to and from the major trading centres along Lake Ontario. The rugged, rough terrain of this area of the province made travel by land extremely difficult and time-consuming.

When the canal was finally completed in 1920, it failed to have a major impact on the economy of the regions it was built to serve. By the time it was completed its design had been made obsolete by larger boats: it had been designed for boats too small to be commercially viable. In the years that it was under construction, railways had further developed their networks and improved service, which influenced settlement patterns.

In 1910-11, the Township of Smith and the Chemong Yacht Club filed a claim for land damages caused by the Trent Canal.

The waterway became obsolete for commercial purposes when the present day Welland Canal was completed in 1932. The Welland Canal could handle ships large enough to sail across the ocean, though cargo was generally transferred to or from larger ocean-going vessels at Montreal.

The Trent–Severn system is still in service. It is maintained and operated by the national park service, Parks Canada, and now is used for tourism and by recreational boaters. There is a cruise line that operates the ship &quot;Kawartha Voyageur&quot;, as well as houseboat rental firms. In June 2013, Barry Devolin, Member of Parliament for the riding of Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock, reintroduced Bill C-530, the &quot;Trent–Severn Water Authority Act&quot;, in order to re-capitalize the century-old infrastructure of the waterway.

<doc id="221440" wikidata="Q470755" url="?curid=221440" title="Mark Pryor">
<text>Mark Lunsford Pryor (born January 10, 1963) is an American attorney, politician and lobbyist who served as a United States Senator from Arkansas from 2003 to 2015. He previously served as Attorney General of Arkansas from 1999 to 2003 and in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1991 to 1995. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Fayetteville, Arkansas, Pryor is the son of former Arkansas Governor and U.S. Senator David Pryor. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and his J.D. degree from its law school. He worked in private practice for several years until being elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 1990. He was elected the state attorney general in 1998. Pryor announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2001, running for the same Senate seat his father had held from 1979 to 1997. He was elected with 54% of the vote, defeating Republican incumbent Tim Hutchinson.

He was reelected with no Republican opposition in 2008. During the 112th Congress he served as the chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance. Pryor ran for reelection in 2014, but was defeated by Republican Tom Cotton. In 2020, Pryor was hired as a lobbyist by Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. He is the most recent Democrat to serve in the U.S. Senate from Arkansas.

==Early life and education==
Pryor was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas, to the future state First Lady Barbara Jean (Lunsford) and future Governor and U.S. Senator David Hampton Pryor, then a state representative. He attended Little Rock Central High School until his father was elected to the United States Senate in 1979, after which he attended Walt Whitman High School in Maryland until graduating in 1981.

He graduated from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and went on to receive his Juris Doctor from the university&#x27;s law school in 1988. During college, he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

==Early career==

Prior to entering politics, Pryor worked as a private practice attorney focusing on civil litigation.

===Arkansas House of Representatives===

He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1991 to 1995.

===Arkansas attorney general===

In 1994, he ran for Arkansas Attorney General, challenging incumbent Winston Bryant in the Democratic primary. Pryor lost 58%-42%. In 1998, he ran for the same position again and became the Democratic Party nominee. He defeated Republican nominee Betty Dicky, the Redfield City Attorney, 59%-41%. He won all but four counties in the state: Benton, Boone, Marion, and Baxter. He was also delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 2000.

==U.S. Senate==

Pryor was recognized for providing a high level of constituent service, and he helped to secure millions of dollars in highway funds for the state. Pryor was also a committed advocate of the state’s military families; he guided the SACRIFICE Act to passage, thus providing families of those injured in combat more timely and reliable medical care.

===Elections===
;2002

In late 2001, Pryor announced his candidacy for the Senate seat held by Tim Hutchinson, who six years earlier had become the first Arkansas Republican to serve in that body since Reconstruction. The seat had been held by his father David Pryor (also a former Arkansas governor), who actively campaigned for his son. Pryor defeated Hutchinson 54% to 46% and was the only Democratic candidate for the Senate to defeat a Republican incumbent in that election cycle.

;2008

Pryor won reelection in 2008 without a Republican opponent. There had been speculation that former Governor Mike Huckabee would run against Pryor if his presidential bid was unsuccessful, but on March 8, Huckabee said he would not contest the race. The only Republican to express interest in the race, health care executive Tom Formicola, decided not to run. Pryor&#x27;s only announced opponent was Green Party candidate Rebekah Kennedy, whom he defeated 80% to 20%.

;2014

Pryor ran for reelection to a third term in 2014, against Republican U.S. House Rep. Tom Cotton.

In March 2014, during an MSNBC news segment regarding the Senate race, Pryor said that Cotton gave off a &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; to a seat in the Senate due to his service in the military. After receiving much criticism for the remark, Pryor later said he was not attacking Cotton’s military service, but his perceived lack of accomplishments in the House: &quot;But the point remains that he&#x27;s been in the House now for a little over a year, he hasn&#x27;t passed any legislation. There&#x27;s not one thing he&#x27;s done for Arkansas.&quot;

FactCheck.org called two ads aired by Pryor&#x27;s 2014 Senate campaign misleading in their criticisms of Paul Ryan&#x27;s Medicare plan, supported by his opponent.

This race was originally thought out to be close, but Pryor lost in a landslide, with 39% of the vote to Cotton&#x27;s 57%. This was the worst performance in the nation for any incumbent Senator since the defeat of then-fellow Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln in 2010.

===Tenure===
Somewhat atypically, Pryor was the Baby of the Senate for 19 days in January 2009, at age 45, despite never having held that distinction in his first term. This was due to the defeat of the younger John E. Sununu, making Pryor the oldest member to ever be the youngest within the Senate until the appointment of Michael Bennet.

In June 2007, before the annual Arkansas Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson dinner, Pryor announced his endorsement of his colleague Sen. Hillary Clinton for president of the United States.

In 2013, Pryor voted with President Obama 90% of the time.

Since 2009, Pryor&#x27;s top three donors have been lawyers ($1,131,431), leadership PACs ($429,149), and lobbyists ($323,769).

===Legislation sponsored===
Pryor introduced the Drought Information Act of 2013 (S. 376; 113th Congress) on February 25, 2013. The bill that would authorize funding for the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) through 2018. The NIDIS is &quot;charged with providing timely information to prevent drought and extreme weather damage.&quot; The bill passed the United States Senate on February 3, 2014.

Pryor introduced the bill &quot;To repeal section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013&quot; on January 27, 2014. The bill would repeal the provision of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 that would reduce the amount of the annual cost of living increase to non-disabled military veterans under age 62. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting Pryor&#x27;s bill would stop the reduction of $6.813 billion from the amount paid to veterans annually.

==Political positions==

===Fiscal policy===
On February 13, 2009, Pryor voted to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

On April 16, 2012, Pryor was the only Democratic senator to vote against the &quot;Buffett Rule,&quot; which was defeated 51 voting in favor to 45 voting against cloture of the filibuster.

In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Pryor opposed the bill. Pryor was up for election in 2014 and was at that time considered &quot;the Senate&#x27;s most vulnerable incumbent.&quot;

===Agriculture===
Senator Pryor was consistently force against proposed cuts to conservation, rural development, agriculture research, nutrition, and forestry programs. In 2014, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, he wrote the $20 billion annual spending legislation that allocates funds for agriculture programs. Pryor secured a legislation within the 2014 Farm bill to allow domestic forestry products to be recognized by USDA as biobased, ensuring such products can be used by the federal government and can be sold as a greener alternative to consumers.

Through the annual budget process, Pryor helped allocate more than $125 million to advance research in forestry, specialty crops, animal science, wetland management, aquaculture and weather management. 
Pryor also worked closely with Senator Boozman to advance agricultural and food law research by allowing institutions such as the National Agricultural Law Center to enter into partnerships with private industry.

===Estate tax===
In June 2006, Pryor voted against repeal of the federal estate tax. In 2013, Pryor and Senator John Boozman (R-AR) were credited by Arkansas Farm Bureau president Randy Veach for their opposition to President Obama&#x27;s plan to raise the estate tax. Pryor co-sponsored a bill that would implement a one-year extension on current estate tax rates. The bill did not pass. In 2008 Pryor voted against expanding the pool of people exempt from the estate tax.

===Health care===
Pryor voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. &quot;Obamacare&quot;) in December 2009, and later voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

===Foreign policy===
Pryor opposes bringing Guantanamo Bay prisoners to the United States for trial.

On September 28, 2006, Pryor was one of 12 Senate Democrats who voted to adopt S.3930, the Military Commissions Act of 2006. He voted against the flag burning amendment in June 2006.

On March 15, 2007, Pryor was one of two Democratic senators to vote against a resolution aimed at withdrawing most American combat troops from Iraq in 2008. The vote, requiring 60 votes to pass, was 50 to 48 against.

===Social policy===
In 2003, Pryor voted for a federal ban on partial-birth abortion. He has voted in favor of the expansion of embryonic stem cell research. He voted against restricting UN funding for population control policies, prohibiting minors crossing state lines for abortion, and barring Health and Human Services grants to organizations that perform abortions.

On December 18, 2010, Pryor voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

===Gun policy===
In 2004, Pryor voted to extend the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

In 2013, Pryor voted against a measure that would have required background checks for all firearms purchases.

In March 2013, Pryor cosponsored a bill that would flag individuals attempting to buy guns who have used an insanity defense, were ruled dangerous by a court, or had been committed by a court to mental health treatment. It did not address the gun show loophole. The bill has not been passed into law.

===Judicial nominees===
On May 23, 2005, Pryor was one of the 14 senators who forged a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; use of the judicial filibuster. This effectively ended any threat of a Democratic filibuster (and thus also avoided the Republican leadership&#x27;s threatened implementation of the so-called nuclear option). Under the agreement, the Democrats would exercise the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance.&quot; The threat of a filibuster removed, Republicans were able to force cloture on the three most conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor-no close relation), who subsequently passed a vote by the full Republican-controlled Senate. He did, however, vote against the nomination of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.

On November 21, 2013, Pryor was one of only three Democratic senators to dissent from Harry Reid&#x27;s leadership to vote against the nuclear option which switched the Senate away from operating on a supermajority basis, to requiring only a simple majority for certain decisions. In his speech on the Senate floor that day, he said that the Senate was, &quot;a place for debate...where Members...can reach across the aisle and find solutions...Part of that is to allow the minority to speak, even if it is a minority of one. We need to protect that right, and we need to protect every Senator&#x27;s right to debate and to amend legislation.&quot; He said that the Senate was, in a sense, &quot;the only place where the minority is guaranteed a voice. They sometimes get outvoted, but they are guaranteed at least to be heard,&quot; and said that he was, &quot;disappointed in the use of the nuclear option. I opposed that. I think it could do permanent damage to this institution and could have some very negative ramifications for our country and for the American people.&quot;.

==Post-Senate career==
In March 2015, Pryor became a partner at D.C.-based law and lobbying firm Venable. During the 2016 and 2020 United States presidential election Pryor was a member of the Platform Committee for the Democratic National Convention.

In 2020, he was recruited by the law and lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, and described the opportunity to work for the powerhouse firm as &quot;kind of like being able to go play football at Clemson or Alabama.&quot; As of 2021, Pryor&#x27;s clients include drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company, meat processor Tyson Foods, power and natural gas conglomerate Duke Energy, and auto manufacturer General Motors, among others.

In 2021, he wrote a piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that called for President Joe Biden to appoint an aggressive antitrust enforcer to lead the Department of Justice Antitrust Division. Pryor is a member of the Board of Advisors of the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF).

==Personal life==
Pryor lives in Little Rock and has a son and a daughter, Adams and Porter. He is married to Joi Pryor. They are members of the First Assembly of God in North Little Rock.

In 1996, Pryor was diagnosed with clear-cell sarcoma, a rare form of cancer, in his left leg. His treatment and rehabilitation took 15 months, and he was told by one doctor that he might have to have his leg amputated, but it was discovered early enough and the cancer was successfully removed.

<text>The polska (Swedish plural &quot;polskor&quot;) is a family of music and dance forms shared by the Nordic countries: called &quot;polsk&quot; in Denmark, polka or polska in Estonia, &quot;polska&quot; in Sweden and Finland, and by several different names in Norway. Norwegian variants include , and . The polska is almost always seen as a partner dance in , although variants in time, as well as in compound meters also exist.

==Evolution==
As suggested by the name, the roots of the polska are often traced back to the influence of the Polish court throughout the northern countries during the early 17th century. (&quot;Polska&quot; also happens to be homonymous with the Swedish word for the Polish language.) This view is sometimes challenged by those who see earlier evidence of the musical tradition in Nordic &quot;visor&quot; or songs, that may have become grafted onto the newer foreign influences when the court dances began to filter out into the middle class and rural communities. In addition, some earlier triple meter dances and melodies may have evolved into the polska. 

The polska dances were likely inspired by court dances such as the &quot;polonaise&quot; or the time minuet involving larger sets of people. Some see traces of the evolution from set dances to couples dances and from duple time to triple time in the minuets, still danced in some communities of Finland and Denmark. In these, the dance starts with a large set of dancers dancing a slower formal section and ends with couples or foursomes dancing a faster, more energetic polska section. In the late 1600s it was common in northern Europe that only the slower Alla breve or section of the music was written down on paper, as paper was expensive. The musicians were expected to be able to improvise a dance in which was based on the same motivic material as the previous dance. The parts played in were the ones evolving to the modern &quot;polska&quot;.

In the prevalent time form, polska dances were most common in Norway, Sweden and Swedish-speaking Finland, but with versions seen in Finnish-speaking Finland and in Denmark. It is best to discuss these dances by country as their regional histories, while contemporaneous, were quite varied and the dances known today differ significantly from one country to the next.

==Norway==
Norway&#x27;s dances show the most consistent living tradition, with unique local dances still performed socially today within specific regions or communities. There are two predominant broad types, each characterized by its own music, instrumentation, and dance tradition.

* Dances referred to as pols are commonly danced to music played on standard fiddles (violins) and largely adhere to a conventional structure composed of two eight-bar phrases, each phrase repeated, and then the whole structure repeated (a total of 64 three-beat measures). The dances typically have a structure that matches the phrasing, with a section in which the couple walks an elaborate promenade, a section in which they dance turn (upper body facing as a couple, bodies rotating counter-clockwise at a rate of one revolution per two measures), a section in escort position, and concluding with a section dancing the pols turn (bodies facing with the couple rotating clockwise at the rate of one turn per measure). Dances in this style were and are danced widely in Norway, predominately in eastern Norway and the mountainous spine bordering Sweden. Communities where this style is popular include the mining town of Røros, and many others in the provinces of Trøndelag, Østerdal, and in Gudbrandsdalen, where the dance in this style is called .
* The other strong tradition in Norway is the &quot;springdans&quot; (running dance) or &quot;springar&quot;, danced primarily in communities in western Norway and the fjord areas of west central Norway. Here, the music is played largely on the &quot;hardingfele&quot; (or Hardanger fiddle; a specially constructed fiddle fitted with four conventionally fingered and bowed strings but also resonating strings (usually five) that produce a distinctive droning sound). The music is also distinct in that tunes are built through the repetition and elaboration of short two- or four-measure motifs. The dance is similarly freer in form, led by the male through a spontaneous sequencing of standard movements as the couple moves through a large variety of holds and underarm turns (these movements appearing similar to modern swing and salsa although in a much slower style). In some traditions much of the dance may be danced with the couple near a single spot (e.g., springar danced in Telemark) while in others they may continue moving counterclockwise around the dance floor (e.g., those danced in Valdres and Hallingdal). The music and dance are still in triple time, but often composed of measures with very asymmetrical beats—for example, a short first and attendant longer second beat—in which the dancers&#x27; steps show adaptation to the unique rhythm.

==Sweden==
In Sweden, the polska music tradition is continuous, with tunes and styles passed down through families, relatives, and neighbors. While styles have certainly evolved over time, the traditions and the roots can be traced back hundreds of years. In addition, through the 19th century a series of professional and semi-professional archivists travelled the land transcribing and annotating tunes. In contrast, however, polska dance traditions came under severe pressure during the industrialization of Sweden and, with few exceptions, succumbed entirely during the early 20th century. Most of what is known about Swedish polska dance comes from research conducted during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. While some early films were located, researchers for the most part collected descriptions from older dancers—in some cases quite elderly ones—who had learned the dances in tradition from close relatives or others in an older generation.

On the other hand, what is known about Swedish polska dancing indicates a rich tradition with perhaps several hundred unique variations of the triple time dances and, frequently, a parallel music tradition of uniquely styled tunes. Broadly, there are three styles of music for Swedish polska:

* The semiquaver or sixteenth-note polska is typically played and danced in a smooth character and even rhythm. This style was characteristic of the music and dance in southern Sweden and up the eastern Baltic coast. Dances in Småland and other provinces of southern Sweden were typically &quot;slängpolskas&quot; with the couple dancing on a spot, often involving intricate patterns of holds and underarm turns similar to those seen in Norwegian springar. Farther up the coast the dances tended to become danced with couples moving counterclockwise around the periphery of the room (perhaps influenced by the introduction of the waltz) and devoting most of the dance to the clockwise couple turn where the couples face each other and make a full rotation with each measure (e.g., the village of Bingsjö in Dalarna and villages in the provinces of Hälsingland and Medelpad).
* The quaver or eighth-note polska is a pervasive style found throughout Sweden, but perhaps reaching its apotheosis in the folk district of Dalarna, where uniquely styled versions can be distinguished in communities only a few kilometers separated from one another or the next municipality (e.g., Boda, Rättvik, and Orsa). The accompanying dance styles tend to emphasize a clockwise couple turn alternating with a resting step in which couples walk—typically stepping on only the first and third beat—in escort position. Rhythms can also become asymmetrical, as for example, the &quot;early two&quot; seen in polska dances from western Dalarna danced in Älvdalen and Transtrand or the &quot;late third&quot; in the south of Dalarna. The wide variation in the placement of the second beat perhaps explains why Swedish fiddlers typically tap their feet on only the first and third beat.
*The triplet polska is the style most commonly seen in the mountainous western sections of the provinces bordering Norway: Värmland, western Dalarna, Jämtland and Härjedalen. The dance traditions show strong cross-border influences with many dances that combine phrase-matching sequences of elaborated promenading, (slower counterclockwise turning) and polska (faster clockwise turning) that are similar to those seen with Norwegian pols. This dance style is also seen with eighth note polska in the border areas.

A typical tune in the Swedish polska tradition shows a common structure, with two related eight-measure phrases, each repeated (a total of 32 bars constituting a single complete rendition of the tune), and the whole structure repeated two or more times. However, there are longer tunes (a &quot;storpolska&quot; or &quot;big polska&quot; has three or occasionally even four phrases) and there exist many tunes with odd numbers of measures per phrase and phrases that vary in length between parts. The first beat is not stressed except in
&quot;hambo&quot; a dance from the beginning of the 20th century.

It is important that sharp lines and distinctions not be drawn. For example, all three styles of polska music form the historical traditions of Jämtland; sixteenth note polskas can also be found in virtually all areas of Sweden; and the placement of the second beat can be controversial even among fiddlers from the same community. Moreover, interesting counter-examples may be found for virtually any statement made in this article.

<doc id="221443" wikidata="Q2746767" url="?curid=221443" title="The Nome Trilogy">
<text>The Nome Trilogy, also known as The Bromeliad Trilogy or just The Bromeliad, is a trilogy of children&#x27;s books by British writer Terry Pratchett, consisting of the books &quot;Truckers&quot; (1989), &quot;Diggers&quot; (1990) and &quot;Wings&quot; (1990). The trilogy tells the story of the Nomes, a race of tiny people from another world who now live hidden among humans. Through the books they struggle to survive in the human world and, once they learn of their history from an artefact known as &quot;The Thing&quot;, make plans to return home.

&quot;Diggers&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; are contemporaneous sequels to &quot;Truckers&quot;, as each book follows different characters through mostly concurrent events. The central character throughout &quot;Truckers&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; is Masklin, while in &quot;Diggers&quot; it is mainly Grimma.

==Themes==
Pratchett covered the idea of small people in some of his early writing, including his unconnected first novel, &quot;The Carpet People&quot; (1971/1992), about the tiny inhabitants of a household carpet, even smaller than Nomes. In 1973 Pratchett wrote &quot;Rincemangle, the Gnome of Even Moor&quot;, one of many serialised children&#x27;s stories for the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot;, in his own words &quot;an earlier and shorter version of what became &quot;Truckers&quot;&quot;.

The main theme in the trilogy is the struggle of challenging society&#x27;s accepted beliefs in the face of new information. This theme recurs through the books and includes changes in the scientific establishment, political establishment, religious beliefs, accepted history and family values of the nomes.

&quot;The Bromeliad&quot; was used as the title for the collected trilogy in the US, as well as some UK editions. It refers to the story told by Grimma in &quot;Diggers&quot; that some species of small frogs live their entire lives inside the flowers of epiphytic bromeliad plants, which is a metaphor used for the Nomes&#x27; experience throughout the books. The frogs themselves appear in &quot;Wings&quot;. The name is also a pun on &quot;The Iliad&quot; and, according to the Annotated Pratchett File, &quot;The Belgariad&quot;.

==Continuity==
References in the books - primarily that they are both set in the fictional town of Blackbury - suggest that they are set in the same world as Pratchett&#x27;s Johnny Maxwell novels (1992–1996), which begin with &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot;.

After being asked if he would write about the Nomes&#x27; return (as implied at the end of &quot;Wings&quot;), Pratchett replied that there could be another book about the nomes. No such book had been announced as of his death.

==US version==
Unusually for Pratchett&#x27;s work, the books were localised. One notable difference between the US and UK versions is the earth-moving machine in &quot;Diggers&quot;, which is called &quot;Jekub&quot; (from JCB) in the UK version, &quot;CAT&quot; in some US editions and &quot;Big John&quot; in others. All three names refer to common generic trademarks for heavy equipment in their respective countries.

==Plot synopses==
===&quot;Truckers&quot; (1989)===
Masklin, a 4-inch high Nome, lives in a grass verge by a motorway service station with his friend Grimma and the remaining elders of their once-large tribe, which has been dwindling due to food shortage and predation by foxes, while several Nomes have headed across the motorway. The other younger members of the tribe departed some time before to find a new place to live, but never returned after crossing the motorway - where they were inevitably killed by cars or lorries. Masklin, finding it increasingly difficult to find food for the group, formulates a plan to escape on a truck from the nearby service station - the final straw being when a fox runs into the path of a lorry after attacking two elder nomes called Mr Mert and Mrs Coom, killing them both. The Elders, led by Granny Morkie and Old Torrit, initially oppose the move but finally agree, bringing with them &#x27;The Thing&#x27;, a small black cube that has been the tribe&#x27;s symbol of authority for as long as anyone can remember.

The truck finally delivers them to the loading bay of Arnold Bros department store, where they are greeted by Angalo De Haberdasheri, an &#x27;Inside&#x27; Nome. Angalo introduces the &#x27;Outsiders&#x27; to his father Duke Cido de Haberdasheri, leader of the Haberdasheri clan, where they learn that most &#x27;Inside&#x27; Nomes do not believe that &#x27;Outside&#x27; exists, being contrary to the religion of Arnold Bros (est 1905), which states that &#x27;The Store&#x27; contains &#x27;All Things Under One Roof&#x27;.

Ejected from the Duke&#x27;s presence, the Outsiders wander the underfloor corridors until &#x27;The Thing&#x27; is accidentally dropped next to an electrical cable, where it starts to recharge itself. &#x27;The Thing&#x27; then powers up and identifies itself as the navigational computer of the Galactic Survey Starship &#x27;Swan&#x27;; the ship developed an engine fault many thousands of years ago, and marooned its Nome crew on Earth. When it asks its primary mission, Masklin tells it to keep the Nomes safe and get them home.

After the Thing picks up radio signals indicating Arnold Bros. is to be demolished, Masklin tries to persuade the &#x27;Insiders&#x27; to evacuate. Only when the old Stationeri Abbot (who dies shortly afterwards) is convinced by the Thing, do they finally win the confidence of the Store Nomes. Taking command of the evacuation and guided by The Thing, Masklin, Grimma and a selected group of Nomes learn how to operate a truck using string and wood levers to operate the controls, then lead the Nomes to the loading bay and steal a truck filled with supplies. Arriving at an abandoned quarry, the Nomes begin a new life Outside, while Masklin watches the planes at the local airport and plans the next step on their journey home...

===&quot;Diggers&quot; (1990)===
Things are going well for the Quarry Nomes since their escape from now-demolished Arnold Bros. department store, with most of the former &#x27;Inside&#x27; Nomes adapting to life outside. Torit dies from old age. Masklin, however, is struggling to deal with his feelings for Grimma. When he clumsily suggests that they should settle down together, Grimma instead tries to tell him that she doesn&#x27;t want to be restricted by a conventional relationship, using the analogy of South American tree frogs that spend their whole lives in a plant called a bromeliad, not knowing anything of the outside world. Masklin doesn&#x27;t understand, and the two fall out. When Masklin, Abbot Gurder and Angalo De Haberdasheri subsequently take The Thing with them to investigate the nearby airport but don&#x27;t come back, it is left to Grimma to deal with a new threat; the abandoned quarry is to be reopened...

Grimma, believing Masklin to be surely dead, finally admits her feelings for him but must put them aside to deal with an attempted revolt by Gurder&#x27;s apprentice, Nisodemus. Nisodemus proposes that they rebuild the store, but is challenged by Grimma. He stands in the road to prove to the Nomes that Arnold Bros. chose him to be leader, but is run over by a car. After attempting to keep the returning humans out by locking the quarry gates, Dorcas and two other nomes try to remove a battery from a lorry, it rolls down a hill into the path of an oncoming train. It is presumed all three nomes are killed. The Nomes in the quarry tie up a security guard and leave a message asking to be left alone. The quarry Nomes finally make an escape attempt using Jekub, an old JCB digger, which Dorcas the engineer discovered in an old shed and repaired. The digger allows the Nomes to escape en masse when the humans return. After being pursued across fields by police cars, they are rescued by Masklin aboard the recovered starship &#x27;Swan&#x27;. Masklin presents Grimma with a bromeliad as a sign that he finally understands her, and they depart Earth for their home planet.

===&quot;Wings&quot; (1990)===
The story is not a sequel but happens simultaneously with the events of &quot;Diggers&quot;.

Masklin, Angalo and Gurder are searching for a plane. They have discovered from a newspaper article that Richard Arnold (or &#x27;Grandson Richard, 39&#x27;, as the paper refers to him), the grandson of the Arnold Brothers who originally built the store, is planning to fly to Florida for the launch of a new satellite. The Thing states that, if they can get it on board the space shuttle, it will be able to contact the spaceship &#x27;Swan&#x27; which has been buried on the moon for thousands of years awaiting instructions.

The Thing connects to the airline computers and finds that &#x27;Grandson Richard, 39&#x27; is due to board Concorde. They sneak on board, and Gurder is overwhelmed to find that the Concorde is just like the store inside, except that there are fewer places for the Nomes to hide. Masklin discovers where &#x27;Grandson Richard, 39&#x27; is sitting, and he suggests hiding in his carry-on luggage.

Arriving in Florida, the Nomes help themselves to hotel food while Arnold is in the shower. Coming out unexpectedly, he sees Masklin, but they escape into the surrounding Everglades where they discover another group of Nomes led by Shrub (that is her name) and her son Pion. Initially they do not understand each other, but The Thing is able to translate; the new group of Nomes speak authentic Nomish, the original language of the Nomes.

The outside Nomes have learned how to ride wild geese and have established contact with thousands of other Nome tribes across the world. Travelling by goose, they reach the launch pad and place The Thing close enough to the shuttle to copy itself to the satellite on board. The Nomes escape moments before the rocket engine ignites.

Having used up its available power, The Thing shuts down. Masklin realises that without The Thing to guide the ship in, it could crash, so he is forced to reveal himself to the humans who take him to a building with a power source. The Thing recharges and informs Masklin that the ship will arrive shortly. While escaping, he encounters Richard Arnold, and Masklin uses The Thing to translate for him, asking Arnold for help. Arnold tells Masklin that his grandfather and great-uncle told stories about Nomes in the store because they heard noises at night, and helps him escape. Aboard the ship he meets up with Angalo, Gurder and Pion and they plan to return to the quarry to get the others, making a short detour to South America to pick up some frogs in a bromeliad.

The Nomes see Concorde flying over the sea to the east, and Masklin realises that it must be flying back to England. They arrive back at the quarry in time to see the Store Nomes careening around a nearby field on Jekub, pursued by a police car, and rescue them (as told in &quot;Diggers&quot;). Masklin presents Grimma with the bromeliad, and they reconcile. All the quarry Nomes climb onboard except for Gurder, who will stay behind on Earth with The Thing to find and tell all other earthbound Nomes about the &#x27;Swan&#x27;. They depart for home, promising to return one day and collect Gurder and all the other Nomes still left on Earth.

==Adaptations==
===TV series===
A stop motion animated series of &quot;Truckers&quot; was produced in the United Kingdom by Cosgrove Hall.

===Film===
In 2001, DreamWorks (now DreamWorks Animation) acquired the film rights to the trilogy, and announced plans to combine all three books into a single film, to be directed by Andrew Adamson. In late 2008, Danny Boyle was attached to direct &quot;Truckers&quot;, but the project fell apart due to financial problems. The following year, the &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;&#x27;s Oscar-winning screenwriter Simon Beaufoy was hired to work on the project. Plans to move forward with DreamWorks&#x27; adaptation resurfaced in 2010 with the announcement that &quot;Legend of the Guardians&quot; screenwriter John Orloff would pen the script for director Anand Tucker. Tucker was later announced to direct another DWA film &quot;Trolls&quot;, which was planned to be partially based on a Pratchett novel, before he was replaced by Mike Mitchell.

<doc id="221444" wikidata="Q3595615" url="?curid=221444" title="Henry Austin Dobson">
<text>Henry Austin Dobson (18 January 1840 – 2 September 1921), commonly Austin Dobson, was an English poet and essayist.

==Life==

He was born at Plymouth, the eldest son of George Clarisse Dobson, a civil engineer, of French descent. When he was about eight, the family moved to Holyhead, and his first school was at Beaumaris in Anglesey. He was later educated at Coventry, and the Gymnase, Strasbourg. He returned at the age of sixteen with the intention of becoming a civil engineer. (His younger brother James would in fact become a noted engineer, helping complete the Buenos Aires harbour works in the 1880s and 1890s.) At the beginning of his career, he continued to study at the South Kensington School of Art, in his spare time, but without definite ambition. In December 1856 he entered the Board of Trade, gradually rising to the rank of principal in the harbour department, from which he retired in the autumn of 1901. In 1868, he married Frances Mary, daughter of the distinguished civil engineer Nathaniel Beardmore (1816–1872) of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and settled at Ealing. Dobson died in 1921 and his funeral was held on 6 September at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Ealing. He is buried in the Westminster Cemetery Uxbridge Road, Hanwell, Middlesex.

==Works==
His official career was uneventful, but as a poet and biographer he was distinguished. Those who study his work are struck by its maturity. It was about 1864 that he turned his attention to writing original prose and verse, and some of his earliest works were his best. It was not until 1868 that the appearance of &quot;St Paul&#x27;s&quot;, a magazine edited by Anthony Trollope, gave Harry Dobson an opportunity and an audience; and during the next six years he contributed some of his favourite poems, including &quot;Tu Quoque,&quot; &quot;A Gentleman of the Old School,&quot; &quot;A Dialogue from Plato,&quot; and &quot;Une Marquise.&quot; Many of his poems in their original form were illustrated—some, indeed, were written to support illustrations. Composer Mary Augusta Wakefield set at least one of his poems to music.


By the autumn of 1873 Dobson had produced enough verse for a volume, and published &quot;Vignettes in Rhyme&quot;, which quickly went through three editions. During the period of their appearance in the magazine the poems had received unusual attention, George Eliot, among others, encouraging the anonymous author. The little book immediately introduced him to a larger public. The period was an interesting one for a first appearance, since the air was full of metrical experiment. Swinburne&#x27;s bold excursions into classical metre had broken new ground; it was hopeless to attempt to compete, and the poets of the day were looking for fresh forms and variations. Early in 1876, a small body of English poets discovered the French forms of Théodore de Banville, Clément Marot and François Villon, and determined to introduce them into English verse.

Dobson, who had already made successful use of the &quot;triolet&quot;, was at the head of this movement, and in May 1876 he published in &quot;The Prodigals&quot; the first original ballade written in English. This he followed by English versions of the rondel, rondeau and villanelle. An article in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; by Edmund Gosse, &quot;A Plea for Certain Exotic Forms of Verse&quot;, appearing in July 1877, simultaneously with Dobson&#x27;s second volume, &quot;Proverbs in Porcelain&quot;, drew the general eye to the possibilities and achievements of the movement. The experiment was deemed a success. In 1883 Dobson published &quot;Old-World Idylls&quot;, which contained some of his most characteristic work. By this time his taste was gradually settling on the period with which it has since become almost exclusively associated; and the spirit of the 18th century was revived in &quot;The Ballad of Beau Brocade&quot; and in &quot;The Story of Rosina&quot;, as nowhere else in modern English poetry. In &quot;Beau Brocade&quot;, the pictorial quality of his work is at its very best. He has been compared with Randolph Caldecott, with which it has much in common; but Dobson&#x27;s humour was not so &quot;rollicking&quot; and his portraiture not so broad as that of the illustrator of &quot;John Gilpin&quot;. His appeal was more intellectual.

&quot;At the Sign of the Lyre&quot; (1885) was the next of Dobson&#x27;s separate volumes of verse, and he also published a volume of &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1897). &quot;At the Sign of the Lyre&quot; contains much variety. The admirably fresh and breezy &quot;Ladies of St James&#x27;s&quot; has precisely the qualities we have traced in his other 18th-century poems; there are ballades and rondeaus, with all the earlier charm; and in &quot;A Revolutionary Relic&quot;, as in &quot;The Child Musician&quot; of the &quot;Old-World Idylls&quot;, the poet reaches a depth of true pathos which he does not often attempt, but in which, when he seeks it, he never fails. Contrasting with these are the light occasional verses, influenced by Winthrop Mackworth Praed, but also quite individual. The chief novelty in &quot;At the Sign of the Lyre&quot; was the series of &quot;Fables of Literature and Art&quot;, founded in manner upon John Gay. It is in these perhaps, more than in any other of his poems, that we see how Dobson interpenetrates the literature of fancy with the literature of judgment.

After 1885 Dobson was engaged mainly in critical and biographical prose, by which he added considerably to the general knowledge of his favourite 18th century writers. His biographies of Henry Fielding (1883), Thomas Bewick (1884), Richard Steele (1886), Oliver Goldsmith (1888), Horace Walpole (1890) and William Hogarth (1879-1891-1897-1902-1907) are studies marked alike by assiduous research, sympathetic presentation and sound criticism. In &quot;Four Frenchwomen&quot; (1890), in the three series of &quot;Eighteenth-Century Vignettes&quot; (1892-1894-1896), and in &quot;The Paladin of Philanthropy&quot; (1899), which contain unquestionably his most delicate prose work, the accurate detail of each study is relieved by a charm of expression which could only be attained by a poet. In 1901 he collected his hitherto unpublished poems in a volume entitled &quot;Carmina Votiva&quot;.

Dobson received an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) from the University of Edinburgh in March 1902.

In 2005 the Industrial/Nu metal band, Industrial Frost, used the words of a Dobson poem called &quot;Before Sedan&quot; as the lyrics of a song of the same name.

<doc id="221451" wikidata="Q7487522" url="?curid=221451" title="Shameless (album)">
<text>Shameless is the sixth full-length album by the rock band Therapy?, and the third and final to be released on Ark 21 Records. It was released on 3 September 2001. The album was recorded at Bob Lang Studios in Seattle from January to February 2001.

&quot;Shameless&quot; is considered by the band to be a straightforward punk rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album with more &#x27;tunes&#x27; than previous album &quot;Suicide Pact – You First&quot;, and reflects the no-nonsense trash-rock that they were listening to at the time. It was also the final album to feature drummer Graham Hopkins, who departed in December 2001. The limited edition CD-ROM included a live video of &quot;Gimme Back My Brain&quot;, recorded at the Visions magazine party in Dortmund in June 2001. The album reached number 196 in the UK Albums Chart.

The album was released on CD and cassette.

<text>Rev Robert Blair (17 April 1699 – 4 February 1746) was a Scottish poet. His fame rests upon his poem &quot;The Grave&quot;, which in a later printing was illustrated by William Blake.

==Biography==

He was the eldest son of the Rev. Robert Blair, one of the king&#x27;s chaplains, and was born at Edinburgh. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and in the Netherlands, and in 1731 was appointed minister of Athelstaneford in East Lothian. In 1738, he married Isabella, daughter of Professor William Law, with whom he had six children. His family&#x27;s wealth gave him leisure for his favourite pursuits: gardening and the study of English poets.

Blair published only three poems. One was a commemoration of his father-in-law and another was a translation. His reputation rests entirely on his third work, &quot;The Grave&quot; (1743), which is a poem written in blank verse on the subject of death and the graveyard. It is much less conventional than its gloomy title might lead one to expect. Its religious subject no doubt contributed to its great popularity, especially in Scotland, where it gave rise to the so-called &quot;graveyard school&quot; of poetry. The poem extends to 767 lines of various merit, in some passages rising to great sublimity, and in others sinking to commonplace.

The poem is now best known for the illustrations created by William Blake following a commission from Robert Cromek. Blake&#x27;s designs were engraved by Luigi Schiavonetti, and published in 1808.

See the biographical introduction prefixed to Blair&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Works&quot;, by Robert Anderson, in his &quot;Poets of Great Britain&quot;, vol. viii. (1794). The only modern edition of &quot;The Grave&quot; is that of Professor James A. Means, which was published in 1973 by the Augustan Reprint Society, Los Angeles.

<text>Prometheus is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered on 24 October 1980 from images taken by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe, and was provisionally designated .

In late 1985 it was officially named after Prometheus, a Titan in Greek mythology. It is also designated .

Prometheus is extremely elongated, measuring approximately . It has several ridges and valleys and a number of impact craters of about diameter are visible, but it is less cratered than nearby Pandora, Epimetheus, and Janus. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it is likely that Prometheus is a very porous icy body. There is much uncertainty in these values, however, and so this remains to be confirmed.

==Interactions with F Ring and other moons==

Prometheus is a shepherd satellite for the inner edge of Saturn&#x27;s narrow F Ring. Pandora orbits just outside the F Ring, and has traditionally been viewed as an outer shepherd of the ring; however, recent studies indicate that only Prometheus contributes to the confinement of the ring.

Images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe show that Prometheus&#x27;s gravitational influence creates kinks and knots in the F Ring as it shepherds material from it. The orbit of Prometheus appears to be chaotic, due to a series of four 121:118 mean-motion resonances with Pandora. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus, as they approach to within approximately 1400 km. Prometheus is itself a significant perturber of Atlas, with which it is in a 53:54 mean-longitude resonance.

<text>Carlo (or Carlino) Dolci (25 May 1616 – 17 January 1686) was an Italian Baroque painter, active mainly in Florence, known for highly finished religious pictures, often repeated in many versions.

==Biography==
He was born in Florence, on his mother&#x27;s side the grandson of a painter. He was precocious and apprenticed at a young age to Jacopo Vignali, and when only eleven years of age he attempted a whole figure of St John, and a head of the infant Christ, which received some approbation. However Dolci was not prolific. &quot;He would take weeks over a single foot&quot;, according to his biographer Baldinucci. His painstaking technique made him unsuited for large-scale fresco painting. He painted chiefly sacred subjects, and his works are generally small in scale, although he made a few life-size pictures. He often repeated the same composition in several versions, and his daughter, Agnese Dolci, also made copies of his works.

After attempting the whole figure of St John, and the head of the infant Christ, he painted a portrait of his mother, displaying a new and delicate style which brought him into notice. This procured him extensive employment at Florence (from which city he hardly ever moved) and in other parts of Italy.

Dolci was known for his piety. It is said that every year during Passion Week he painted a half-figure of the Savior wearing the Crown of Thorns. In 1682, when he saw Giordano, nicknamed &quot;fa presto&quot; (quick worker), paint more in five hours than he could have completed in months, he fell into a depression.

Dolci&#x27;s daughter, Agnese (died circa 1680), was also a painter. Dolci died in Florence in 1686.

==Works==

The grand manner, vigorous coloration or luminosity, and dynamic emotion of the Bolognese-Roman Baroque are foreign to Dolci and to Baroque Florence. While he fits into a long tradition of prestigious official Florentine painting, Dolci appears constitutionally blind to the new aesthetic, shackled by the Florentine tradition that holds each drawn figure under a microscope of academicism. Wittkower describes him as the Florentine counterpart, in terms of devotional imagery, of the Roman Sassoferrato. Pilkington declared his touch &quot;inexpressibly neat ... though he has often been censured for the excessive labour bestowed on his pictures, and for giving his carnations more of the appearance of ivory than the look of flesh&quot;, a flaw that had been already apparent in Agnolo Bronzino.

Among his best works are a &quot;St Sebastian&quot;; the &quot;Four Evangelists&quot; at Florence; &quot;Christ Breaking the Bread&quot;; the &quot;St Cecilia at the Organ&quot;; an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; in the National Gallery, London; the &quot;St Catherine Reading&quot; and &quot;St Andrew praying before his Crucifixion&quot; (1646) in the Palazzo Pitti. He completed his portrait of &quot;Fra Ainolfo de&#x27; Bardi&quot;, when he was only sixteen. He also painted a large altarpiece (1656) for the church of Sant&#x27; Andrea Cennano in Montevarchi. As was typical for Florentine painters, this was a painting about painting, and in it the Virgin of Soriano holds a miraculous and iconic painting of St Dominic.

<text>High Anxiety is the seventh full-length album by the rock band Therapy?, and was the first to be released on Spitfire Records. It was released on 5 May 2003. The album was recorded from December 2002 to January 2003 at Parkgate Studios in Hastings.

&quot;High Anxiety&quot; was the first album to feature drummer Neil Cooper, and the last recorded with guitarist/cellist Martin McCarrick, who departed in 2004. The album has a similar production value to &quot;Troublegum&quot;, and is a return to that album&#x27;s sense of melodic punk.

The album title is taken from a 1977 Mel Brooks movie of the same name.

The US released limited edition CD-ROM included the video of &quot;If It Kills Me&quot;. The album reached number 113 in the UK Albums Chart.

The album was released on CD and cassette.

Polish label Metal Mind Productions re-released the album on 2 November 2009. The album was remastered using 24-Bit technology, limited to 1000 copies, on a gold disk digipak CD.

<doc id="221466" wikidata="Q127879" url="?curid=221466" title="Message Passing Interface">
<text>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a portable message-passing standard designed to function on parallel computing architectures. The MPI standard defines the syntax and semantics of library routines that are useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in C, C++, and Fortran. There are several open-source MPI implementations, which fostered the development of a parallel software industry, and encouraged development of portable and scalable large-scale parallel applications.

==History==
The message passing interface effort began in the summer of 1991 when a small group of researchers started discussions at a mountain retreat in Austria. Out of that discussion came a Workshop on Standards for Message Passing in a Distributed Memory Environment, held on April 29–30, 1992 in Williamsburg, Virginia. Attendees at Williamsburg discussed the basic features essential to a standard message-passing interface and established a working group to continue the standardization process. Jack Dongarra, Tony Hey, and David W. Walker put forward a preliminary draft proposal, &quot;MPI1&quot;, in November 1992. In November 1992 a meeting of the MPI working group took place in Minneapolis and decided to place the standardization process on a more formal footing. The MPI working group met every 6 weeks throughout the first 9 months of 1993. The draft MPI standard was presented at the Supercomputing &#x27;93 conference in November 1993. After a period of public comments, which resulted in some changes in MPI, version 1.0 of MPI was released in June 1994. These meetings and the email discussion together constituted the MPI Forum, membership of which has been open to all members of the high-performance-computing community.

The MPI effort involved about 80 people from 40 organizations, mainly in the United States and Europe. Most of the major vendors of concurrent computers were involved in the MPI effort, collaborating with researchers from universities, government laboratories, and industry.

MPI provides parallel hardware vendors with a clearly defined base set of routines that can be efficiently implemented. As a result, hardware vendors can build upon this collection of standard low-level routines to create higher-level routines for the distributed-memory communication environment supplied with their parallel machines. MPI provides a simple-to-use portable interface for the basic user, yet one powerful enough to allow programmers to use the high-performance message passing operations available on advanced machines.

In an effort to create a universal standard for message passing, researchers did not base it off of a single system but it incorporated the most useful features of several systems, including those designed by IBM, Intel, nCUBE, PVM, Express, P4 and PARMACS. The message-passing paradigm is attractive because of wide portability and can be used in communication for distributed-memory and shared-memory multiprocessors, networks of workstations, and a combination of these elements. The paradigm can apply in multiple settings, independent of network speed or memory architecture.

Support for MPI meetings came in part from DARPA and from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant ASC-9310330, NSF Science and Technology Center Cooperative agreement number CCR-8809615, and from the European Commission through Esprit Project P6643. The University of Tennessee also made financial contributions to the MPI Forum.

== Overview ==

MPI is a communication protocol for programming parallel computers. Both point-to-point and collective communication are supported. MPI &quot;is a message-passing application programmer interface, together with protocol and semantic specifications for how its features must behave in any implementation.&quot; MPI&#x27;s goals are high performance, scalability, and portability. MPI remains the dominant model used in high-performance computing today.

MPI is not sanctioned by any major standards body; nevertheless, it has become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for communication among processes that model a parallel program running on a distributed memory system. Actual distributed memory supercomputers such as computer clusters often run such programs.

The principal MPI-1 model has no shared memory concept, and MPI-2 has only a limited distributed shared memory concept. Nonetheless, MPI programs are regularly run on shared memory computers, and both MPICH and Open MPI can use shared memory for message transfer if it is available. Designing programs around the MPI model (contrary to explicit shared memory models) has advantages when running on NUMA architectures since MPI encourages memory locality. Explicit shared memory programming was introduced in MPI-3.

Although MPI belongs in layers 5 and higher of the OSI Reference Model, implementations may cover most layers, with sockets and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used in the transport layer.

Most MPI implementations consist of a specific set of routines directly callable from C, C++, Fortran (i.e., an API) and any language able to interface with such libraries, including C#, Java or Python. The advantages of MPI over older message passing libraries are portability (because MPI has been implemented for almost every distributed memory architecture) and speed (because each implementation is in principle optimized for the hardware on which it runs).

MPI uses Language Independent Specifications (LIS) for calls and language bindings. The first MPI standard specified ANSI C and Fortran-77 bindings together with the LIS. The draft was presented at Supercomputing 1994 (November 1994) and finalized soon thereafter. About 128 functions constitute the MPI-1.3 standard which was released as the final end of the MPI-1 series in 2008.
At present, the standard has several versions: version 1.3 (commonly abbreviated &quot;MPI-1&quot;), which emphasizes message passing and has a static runtime environment, MPI-2.2 (MPI-2), which includes new features such as parallel I/O, dynamic process management and remote memory operations, and MPI-3.1 (MPI-3), which includes extensions to the collective operations with non-blocking versions and extensions to the one-sided operations.
MPI-2&#x27;s LIS specifies over 500 functions and provides language bindings for ISO C, ISO C++, and Fortran 90. Object interoperability was also added to allow easier mixed-language message passing programming. A side-effect of standardizing MPI-2, completed in 1996, was clarifying the MPI-1 standard, creating the MPI-1.2.

&quot;MPI-2&quot; is mostly a superset of MPI-1, although some functions have been deprecated. MPI-1.3 programs still work under MPI implementations compliant with the MPI-2 standard.

&quot;MPI-3.0&quot; introduces significant updates to the MPI standard, including nonblocking versions of collective operations, enhancements to one-sided operations, and a Fortran 2008 binding. It removes deprecated C++ bindings and various obsolete routines and objects. Importantly, any valid MPI-2.2 program that avoids the removed elements is also valid in MPI-3.0.

&quot;MPI-3.1&quot; is a minor update focused on corrections and clarifications, particularly for Fortran bindings. It introduces new functions for manipulating MPI_Aint values, nonblocking collective I/O routines, and methods for retrieving index values by name for MPI_T performance variables. Additionally, a general index was added. All valid MPI-3.0 programs are also valid in MPI-3.1.

&quot;MPI-4.0&quot; is a major update that introduces large-count versions of many routines, persistent collective operations, partitioned communications, and a new MPI initialization method. It also adds application info assertions and improves error handling definitions, along with various smaller enhancements. Any valid MPI-3.1 program is compatible with MPI-4.0.

MPI-4.1 is a minor update focused on corrections and clarifications to the MPI-4.0 standard. It deprecates several routines, the MPI_HOST attribute key, and the mpif.h Fortran include file. A new routine has been added to inquire about the hardware running the MPI program. Any valid MPI-4.0 program remains valid in MPI-4.1.

MPI is often compared with Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM), which is a popular distributed environment and message passing system developed in 1989, and which was one of the systems that motivated the need for standard parallel message passing. Threaded shared memory programming models (such as Pthreads and OpenMP) and message passing programming (MPI/PVM) can be considered complementary and have been used together on occasion in, for example, servers with multiple large shared-memory nodes.

==Functionality==

The MPI interface is meant to provide essential virtual topology, synchronization, and communication functionality between a set of processes (that have been mapped to nodes/servers/computer instances) in a language-independent way, with language-specific syntax (bindings), plus a few language-specific features. MPI programs always work with processes, but programmers commonly refer to the processes as processors. Typically, for maximum performance, each CPU (or core in a multi-core machine) will be assigned just a single process. This assignment happens at runtime through the agent that starts the MPI program, normally called mpirun or mpiexec.

MPI library functions include, but are not limited to, point-to-point rendezvous-type send/receive operations, choosing between a Cartesian or graph-like logical process topology, exchanging data between process pairs (send/receive operations), combining partial results of computations (gather and reduce operations), synchronizing nodes (barrier operation) as well as obtaining network-related information such as the number of processes in the computing session, current processor identity that a process is mapped to, neighboring processes accessible in a logical topology, and so on. Point-to-point operations come in synchronous, asynchronous, buffered, and &quot;ready&quot; forms, to allow both relatively stronger and weaker semantics for the synchronization aspects of a rendezvous-send. Many outstanding operations are possible in asynchronous mode, in most implementations.

MPI-1 and MPI-2 both enable implementations that overlap communication and computation, but practice and theory differ. MPI also specifies &quot;thread safe&quot; interfaces, which have cohesion and coupling strategies that help avoid hidden state within the interface. It is relatively easy to write multithreaded point-to-point MPI code, and some implementations support such code. Multithreaded collective communication is best accomplished with multiple copies of Communicators, as described below.

==Concepts==
MPI provides several features. The following concepts provide context for all of those abilities and help the programmer to decide what functionality to use in their application programs. Four of MPI&#x27;s eight basic concepts are unique to MPI-2.

===Communicator===
Communicator objects connect groups of processes in the MPI session. Each communicator gives each contained process an independent identifier and arranges its contained processes in an ordered topology. MPI also has explicit groups, but these are mainly good for organizing and reorganizing groups of processes before another communicator is made. MPI understands single group intracommunicator operations, and bilateral intercommunicator communication. In MPI-1, single group operations are most prevalent. Bilateral operations mostly appear in MPI-2 where they include collective communication and dynamic in-process management.

Communicators can be partitioned using several MPI commands. These commands include codice_1, where each process joins one of several colored sub-communicators by declaring itself to have that color.

===Point-to-point basics===
A number of important MPI functions involve communication between two specific processes. A popular example is codice_2, which allows one specified process to send a message to a second specified process. Point-to-point operations, as these are called, are particularly useful in patterned or irregular communication, for example, a data-parallel architecture in which each processor routinely swaps regions of data with specific other processors between calculation steps, or a master–slave architecture in which the master sends new task data to a slave whenever the prior task is completed.

MPI-1 specifies mechanisms for both blocking and non-blocking point-to-point communication mechanisms, as well as the so-called &#x27;ready-send&#x27; mechanism whereby a send request can be made only when the matching receive request has already been made.

===Collective basics===
Collective functions involve communication among all processes in a process group (which can mean the entire process pool or a program-defined subset). A typical function is the codice_3 call (short for &quot;broadcast&quot;). This function takes data from one node and sends it to all processes in the process group. A reverse operation is the codice_4 call, which takes data from all processes in a group, performs an operation (such as summing), and stores the results on one node. codice_4 is often useful at the start or end of a large distributed calculation, where each processor operates on a part of the data and then combines it into a result.

Other operations perform more sophisticated tasks, such as codice_6 which rearranges &quot;n&quot; items of data such that the &quot;n&quot;th node gets the &quot;n&quot;th item of data from each.

===Derived data types===
Many MPI functions require that you specify the type of data which is sent between processes. This is because MPI aims to support heterogeneous environments where types might be represented differently on the different nodes (for example they might be running different CPU architectures that have different endianness), in which case MPI implementations can perform &quot;data conversion&quot;. Since the C language does not allow a type itself to be passed as a parameter, MPI predefines the constants codice_7, codice_8, codice_9 to correspond with codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, etc.

Here is an example in C that passes arrays of codice_10s from all processes to one. The one receiving process is called the &quot;root&quot; process, and it can be any designated process but normally it will be process 0. All the processes ask to send their arrays to the root with codice_14, which is equivalent to having each process (including the root itself) call codice_2 and the root make the corresponding number of ordered codice_16 calls to assemble all of these arrays into a larger one:

int send_array[100];
int root = 0; /* or whatever */
int num_procs, *recv_array;
MPI_Comm_size(comm, &amp;num_procs);
recv_array = malloc(num_procs * sizeof(send_array));
MPI_Gather(send_array, sizeof(send_array) / sizeof(*send_array), MPI_INT,
 recv_array, sizeof(send_array) / sizeof(*send_array), MPI_INT,
 root, comm);
However, you may instead wish to send data as one block as opposed to 100 codice_10s. To do this define a &quot;contiguous block&quot; derived data type:

MPI_Datatype newtype;
MPI_Type_contiguous(100, MPI_INT, &amp;newtype);
MPI_Type_commit(&amp;newtype);
MPI_Gather(array, 1, newtype, receive_array, 1, newtype, root, comm);
For passing a class or a data structure, codice_18 creates an MPI derived data type from codice_19 data types, as follows:

int MPI_Type_create_struct(int count,
 int *blocklen,
 MPI_Aint *disp,
 MPI_Datatype *type,
 MPI_Datatype *newtype)

where:
* codice_20 is a number of blocks, and specifies the length (in elements) of the arrays codice_21, codice_22, and codice_23.
* codice_21 contains numbers of elements in each block,
* codice_22 contains byte displacements of each block,
* codice_23 contains types of element in each block.
* codice_27 (an output) contains the new derived type created by this function

The codice_22 (displacements) array is needed for data structure alignment, since the compiler may pad the variables in a class or data structure. The safest way to find the distance between different fields is by obtaining their addresses in memory. This is done with codice_29, which is normally the same as C&#x27;s codice_30 operator but that might not be true when dealing with memory segmentation.

Passing a data structure as one block is significantly faster than passing one item at a time, especially if the operation is to be repeated. This is because fixed-size blocks do not require serialization during transfer.

Given the following data structures:

struct A {
 int f;
 short p;

struct B {
 struct A a;
 int pp, vp;


Here&#x27;s the C code for building an MPI-derived data type:

static const int blocklen[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
static const MPI_Aint disp[] = {
 offsetof(struct B, a) + offsetof(struct A, f),
 offsetof(struct B, a) + offsetof(struct A, p),
 offsetof(struct B, pp),
 offsetof(struct B, vp)
static MPI_Datatype type[] = {MPI_INT, MPI_SHORT, MPI_INT, MPI_INT};
MPI_Datatype newtype;
MPI_Type_create_struct(sizeof(type) / sizeof(*type), blocklen, disp, type, &amp;newtype);
MPI_Type_commit(&amp;newtype);
==MPI-2 concepts==

===One-sided communication===
MPI-2 defines three one-sided communications operations, codice_31, codice_32, and codice_33, being a write to remote memory, a read from remote memory, and a reduction operation on the same memory across a number of tasks, respectively. Also defined are three different methods to synchronize this communication (global, pairwise, and remote locks) as the specification does not guarantee that these operations have taken place until a synchronization point.

These types of call can often be useful for algorithms in which synchronization would be inconvenient (e.g. distributed matrix multiplication), or where it is desirable for tasks to be able to balance their load while other processors are operating on data.

===Dynamic process management===
The key aspect is &quot;the ability of an MPI process to participate in the creation of new MPI processes or to establish communication with MPI processes that have been started separately.&quot; The MPI-2 specification describes three main interfaces by which MPI processes can dynamically establish communications, codice_34, codice_35/codice_36 and codice_37. The codice_34 interface allows an MPI process to spawn a number of instances of the named MPI process. The newly spawned set of MPI processes form a new codice_39 intracommunicator but can communicate with the parent and the intercommunicator the function returns. codice_40 is an alternate interface that allows the different instances spawned to be different binaries with different arguments.

===I/O===
The parallel I/O feature is sometimes called MPI-IO, and refers to a set of functions designed to abstract I/O management on distributed systems to MPI, and allow files to be easily accessed in a patterned way using the existing derived datatype functionality.

The little research that has been done on this feature indicates that it may not be trivial to get high performance gains by using MPI-IO. For example, an implementation of sparse matrix-vector multiplications using the MPI I/O library shows a general behavior of minor performance gain, but these results are inconclusive. It was not 
until the idea of collective I/O implemented into MPI-IO that MPI-IO started to reach widespread adoption. Collective I/O substantially boosts applications&#x27; I/O bandwidth by having processes collectively transform the small and noncontiguous I/O operations into large and contiguous ones, thereby reducing the locking and disk seek overhead. Due to its vast performance benefits, MPI-IO also became the underlying I/O layer for many state-of-the-art I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and Parallel NetCDF. Its popularity also triggered research on collective I/O optimizations, such as layout-aware I/O and cross-file aggregation.

==Official implementations==

* The initial implementation of the MPI 1.x standard was MPICH, from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Mississippi State University. IBM also was an early implementor, and most early 90s supercomputer companies either commercialized MPICH, or built their own implementation. LAM/MPI from Ohio Supercomputer Center was another early open implementation. ANL has continued developing MPICH for over a decade, and now offers MPICH-3.2, implementing the MPI-3.1 standard.
* Open MPI (not to be confused with OpenMP) was formed by the merging FT-MPI, LA-MPI, LAM/MPI, and PACX-MPI, and is found in many TOP-500 supercomputers.

Many other efforts are derivatives of MPICH, LAM, and other works, including, but not limited to, commercial implementations from HPE, Intel, Microsoft, and NEC.

While the specifications mandate a C and Fortran interface, the language used to implement MPI is not constrained to match the language or languages it seeks to support at runtime. Most implementations combine C, C++ and assembly language, and target C, C++, and Fortran programmers. Bindings are available for many other languages, including Perl, Python, R, Ruby, Java, and CL (see #Language bindings).

The ABI of MPI implementations are roughly split between MPICH and Open MPI derivatives, so that a library from one family works as a drop-in replacement of one from the same family, but direct replacement across families is impossible. The French CEA maintains a wrapper interface to facilitate such switches.

===Hardware===
MPI hardware research focuses on implementing MPI directly in hardware, for example via processor-in-memory, building MPI operations into the microcircuitry of the RAM chips in each node. By implication, this approach is independent of language, operating system, and CPU, but cannot be readily updated or removed.

Another approach has been to add hardware acceleration to one or more parts of the operation, including hardware processing of MPI queues and using RDMA to directly transfer data between memory and the network interface controller without CPU or OS kernel intervention.

===Compiler wrappers===
mpicc (and similarly mpic++, mpif90, etc.) is a program that wraps over an existing compiler to set the necessary command-line flags when compiling code that uses MPI. Typically, it adds a few flags that enable the code to be the compiled and linked against the MPI library.

==Language bindings==
Bindings are libraries that extend MPI support to other languages by wrapping an existing MPI implementation such as MPICH or Open MPI.

===Common Language Infrastructure===
The two managed Common Language Infrastructure .NET implementations are Pure Mpi.NET and MPI.NET, a research effort at Indiana University licensed under a BSD-style license. It is compatible with Mono, and can make full use of underlying low-latency MPI network fabrics.

===Java===
Although Java does not have an official MPI binding, several groups attempt to bridge the two, with different degrees of success and compatibility. One of the first attempts was Bryan Carpenter&#x27;s mpiJava, essentially a set of Java Native Interface (JNI) wrappers to a local C MPI library, resulting in a hybrid implementation with limited portability, which also has to be compiled against the specific MPI library being used.

However, this original project also defined the mpiJava API (a de facto MPI API for Java that closely followed the equivalent C++ bindings) which other subsequent Java MPI projects adopted. One less-used API is MPJ API, which was designed to be more object-oriented and closer to Sun Microsystems&#x27; coding conventions. Beyond the API, Java MPI libraries can be either dependent on a local MPI library, or implement the message passing functions in Java, while some like P2P-MPI also provide peer-to-peer functionality and allow mixed-platform operation.

Some of the most challenging parts of Java/MPI arise from Java characteristics such as the lack of explicit pointers and the linear memory address space for its objects, which make transferring multidimensional arrays and complex objects inefficient. Workarounds usually involve transferring one line at a time and/or performing explicit de-serialization and casting at both the sending and receiving ends, simulating C or Fortran-like arrays by the use of a one-dimensional array, and pointers to primitive types by the use of single-element arrays, thus resulting in programming styles quite far from Java conventions.

Another Java message passing system is MPJ Express. Recent versions can be executed in cluster and multicore configurations. In the cluster configuration, it can execute parallel Java applications on clusters and clouds. Here Java sockets or specialized I/O interconnects like Myrinet can support messaging between MPJ Express processes. It can also utilize native C implementation of MPI using its native device. In the multicore configuration, a parallel Java application is executed on multicore processors. In this mode, MPJ Express processes are represented by Java threads.

===Julia===
There is a Julia language wrapper for MPI.

===MATLAB===
There are a few academic implementations of MPI using MATLAB. MATLAB has its own parallel extension library implemented using MPI and PVM.

===OCaml===
The OCamlMPI Module implements a large subset of MPI functions and is in active use in scientific computing. An 11,000-line OCaml program was &quot;MPI-ified&quot; using the module, with an additional 500 lines of code and slight restructuring and ran with excellent results on up to 170 nodes in a supercomputer.

===PARI/GP===

PARI/GP can be built to use MPI as its multi-thread engine, allowing to run parallel PARI and GP programs on MPI clusters unmodified.

===Python===
Actively maintained MPI wrappers for Python include: mpi4py, numba-mpi and numba-jax.

Discontinued developments include: pyMPI, pypar, MYMPI and the MPI submodule in ScientificPython.

===R===
R bindings of MPI include Rmpi and pbdMPI, where Rmpi focuses on manager-workers parallelism while pbdMPI focuses on SPMD parallelism. Both implementations fully support Open MPI or MPICH2.

==Example program==
Here is a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in MPI written in C. In this example, we send a &quot;hello&quot; message to each processor, manipulate it trivially, return the results to the main process, and print the messages.
/*
 &quot;Hello World&quot; MPI Test Program
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
 char buf[256];
 int my_rank, num_procs;

 /* Initialize the infrastructure necessary for communication */
 MPI_Init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

 /* Identify this process */
 MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;my_rank);

 /* Find out how many total processes are active */
 MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;num_procs);

 /* Until this point, all programs have been doing exactly the same.
 Here, we check the rank to distinguish the roles of the programs */
 if (my_rank == 0) {
 int other_rank;
 printf(&quot;We have %i processes.\n&quot;, num_procs);

 /* Send messages to all other processes */
 for (other_rank = 1; other_rank &lt; num_procs; other_rank++)
 sprintf(buf, &quot;Hello %i!&quot;, other_rank);
 MPI_Send(buf, 256, MPI_CHAR, other_rank,
 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

 /* Receive messages from all other processes */
 for (other_rank = 1; other_rank &lt; num_procs; other_rank++)
 MPI_Recv(buf, 256, MPI_CHAR, other_rank,
 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
 printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, buf);

 } else {

 /* Receive message from process #0 */
 MPI_Recv(buf, 256, MPI_CHAR, 0,
 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
 assert(memcmp(buf, &quot;Hello &quot;, 6) == 0);

 /* Send message to process #0 */
 sprintf(buf, &quot;Process %i reporting for duty.&quot;, my_rank);
 MPI_Send(buf, 256, MPI_CHAR, 0,
 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

 /* Tear down the communication infrastructure */
 MPI_Finalize();
 return 0;


When run with 4 processes, it should produce the following output:

Here, codice_41 is a command used to execute the example program with 4 processes, each of which is an independent instance of the program at run time and assigned ranks (i.e. numeric IDs) 0, 1, 2, and 3. The name codice_41 is recommended by the MPI standard, although some implementations provide a similar command under the name codice_43. The codice_39 is the communicator that consists of all the processes.

A single program, multiple data (SPMD) programming model is thereby facilitated, but not required; many MPI implementations allow multiple, different, executables to be started in the same MPI job. Each process has its own rank, the total number of processes in the world, and the ability to communicate between them either with point-to-point (send/receive) communication, or by collective communication among the group. It is enough for MPI to provide an SPMD-style program with codice_39, its own rank, and the size of the world to allow algorithms to decide what to do. In more realistic situations, I/O is more carefully managed than in this example. MPI does not stipulate how standard I/O (stdin, stdout, stderr) should work on a given system. It generally works as expected on the rank-0 process, and some implementations also capture and funnel the output from other processes.

MPI uses the notion of process rather than processor. Program copies are &quot;mapped&quot; to processors by the MPI runtime. In that sense, the parallel machine can map to one physical processor, or to &quot;N&quot; processors, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of available processors, or even something in between. For maximum parallel speedup, more physical processors are used. This example adjusts its behavior to the size of the world &quot;N&quot;, so it also seeks to scale to the runtime configuration without compilation for each size variation, although runtime decisions might vary depending on that absolute amount of concurrency available.

==MPI-2 adoption==
Adoption of MPI-1.2 has been universal, particularly in cluster computing, but acceptance of MPI-2.1 has been more limited. Issues include:

# MPI-2 implementations include I/O and dynamic process management, and the size of the middleware is substantially larger. Most sites that use batch scheduling systems cannot support dynamic process management. MPI-2&#x27;s parallel I/O is well accepted.
# Many MPI-1.2 programs were developed before MPI-2. Portability concerns initially slowed adoption, although wider support has lessened this.
# Many MPI-1.2 applications use only a subset of that standard (16-25 functions) with no real need for MPI-2 functionality.

==Future==
Some aspects of the MPI&#x27;s future appear solid; others less so. The MPI Forum reconvened in 2007 to clarify some MPI-2 issues and explore developments for a possible MPI-3, which resulted in versions MPI-3.0 (September 2012) and MPI-3.1 (June 2015). The development continued with the approval of MPI-4.0 on June 9, 2021, and most recently, MPI-4.1 was approved on November 2, 2023.

Architectures are changing, with greater internal concurrency (multi-core), better fine-grained concurrency control (threading, affinity), and more levels of memory hierarchy. Multithreaded programs can take advantage of these developments more easily than single-threaded applications. This has already yielded separate, complementary standards for symmetric multiprocessing, namely OpenMP. MPI-2 defines how standard-conforming implementations should deal with multithreaded issues, but does not require that implementations be multithreaded, or even thread-safe. MPI-3 adds the ability to use shared-memory parallelism within a node. Implementations of MPI such as Adaptive MPI, Hybrid MPI, Fine-Grained MPI, MPC and others offer extensions to the MPI standard that address different challenges in MPI.

Astrophysicist Jonathan Dursi wrote an opinion piece calling MPI obsolescent, pointing to newer technologies like the Chapel language, Unified Parallel C, Hadoop, Spark and Flink. At the same time, nearly all of the projects in the Exascale Computing Project build explicitly on MPI; MPI has been shown to scale to the largest machines as of the early 2020s and is widely considered to stay relevant for a long time to come.

<doc id="221467" wikidata="Q725728" url="?curid=221467" title="Theodore G. Bilbo">
<text>Theodore Gilmore Bilbo (October 13, 1877 – August 21, 1947) was an American politician who twice served as governor of Mississippi (1916–1920, 1928–1932) and later was elected a U.S. Senator (1935–1947). Bilbo was a demagogue and filibusterer whose name was synonymous with white supremacy. Like many Southern Democrats of his era, Bilbo believed that black people were inferior; he defended segregation, and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, the United States&#x27; largest white supremacist terrorist organization. He also published a pro-segregation work, &quot;Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization&quot;.

Bilbo was educated in rural Hancock County (later Pearl River County). He attended Peabody Normal College in Nashville, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University Law School. After teaching school, he attained admission to the bar in 1906 and practiced in Poplarville. He then served in the Mississippi State Senate for four years, from 1908 to 1912.

Bilbo overcame accusations of accepting bribes and won an election for lieutenant governor, a position that he held from 1912 to 1916. In 1915, he was elected governor and served from 1916 to 1920. During this term, he earned accolades for enacting Progressive measures such as compulsory school attendance and increased spending on public works projects. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1920.

Bilbo won the election to the governorship again in 1927, and he served from 1928 to 1932. During this term, Bilbo caused controversy by attempting to move the University of Mississippi from Oxford to Jackson. In another controversy, he aided Democratic nominee Al Smith in the 1928 presidential election by spreading the story that Republican nominee Herbert Hoover had socialized with a black woman; Mississippi voters, considering whether to maintain their allegiance to the Democratic Party in light of Smith&#x27;s Catholicism and support for the repeal of Prohibition, largely remained with Smith after Bilbo&#x27;s appeal to racism.

In 1930, under Governor Bilbo, Mississippi introduced a sales tax—the first American state to do so. In 1934, Bilbo won election to a seat in the United States Senate. In the Senate, Bilbo maintained his support for segregation and white supremacy; he was also attracted to the ideas of the black separatist movement, considering it a potentially viable method of maintaining segregation. He proposed resettling the 12 million American blacks in Africa. In his second term, he made anti-black racism a major theme. Regarding economic policy, he moved away from support for the New Deal and increasingly joined the Conservative Coalition. Opposing Roosevelt, he became isolationist in foreign policy and opposed labor unions. He was the leader in fighting FDR&#x27;s Fair Employment Practice Committee and helped kill the nomination of New Dealer Aubrey Willis Williams, a liberal Southerner, to head the Rural Electrification Administration. Although reelected to a third term in 1946, liberals led by Glen H. Taylor blocked his seating based on denying the vote to blacks and accepting bribes. By the time he died (without taking his seat), the national media had made him the symbol of racism.

Bilbo died in a New Orleans hospital while undergoing cancer treatment and was buried at Juniper Grove Cemetery in Poplarville. Bilbo was of short stature (), frequently wore bright, flashy clothing to draw attention to himself, and was nicknamed &quot;The Man&quot; because he tended to refer to himself in the third person.

==Education and family background==
On October 13, 1877, Bilbo was born in the small town of Juniper Grove in Hancock (later Pearl River) County. His parents, Obedience &quot;Beedy&quot; (née Wallis or Wallace) and James Oliver Bilbo, were of Scotch-Irish descent; James was a farmer and veteran of the Confederate States Army who rose from poverty during Theodore Bilbo&#x27;s early years to become Vice President of the Poplarville National Bank. Theodore Bilbo obtained a scholarship to attend Peabody Normal College in Nashville, Tennessee, and later attended Vanderbilt University Law School, but did not graduate from either. He also taught school and worked at a drug store during his legal studies. During his teaching career, Bilbo was accused of being overly familiar with a female student. He was admitted to the bar in Tennessee in 1906, and began a law practice in Poplarville, Mississippi, the following year.

Although he had been admitted to the senior class at Vanderbilt, he left without graduating. He was accused of cheating in academics, but he likely left school for financial reasons. Though these accusations never rose to the level of formal charges, they helped create the perception that Bilbo was profligate and dishonest.

==State Senate==
On November 5, 1907, Bilbo was elected to the Mississippi State Senate. He served there from 1908 to 1912. In 1909 he attended non-credit summer courses at the University of Michigan Law School when the legislature was not in session.

In 1910, Bilbo attracted national attention in a bribery scandal. After the death of U.S. Senator James Gordon, the legislature was deadlocked in choosing between LeRoy Percy or former Governor James K. Vardaman as Gordon&#x27;s successor. After 58 ballots, on February 28, Bilbo was one of several candidates to break the stalemate by switching his vote to Percy, who won 87–82. Bilbo told a grand jury the next day that he had accepted a $645 bribe from L. C. Dulaney but that he had done so as part of a private investigation. The State Senate voted 28–10 to expel him from office, falling one vote short of the majority needed. The Senate passed a resolution – which did not require a majority – calling him &quot;unfit to sit with honest, upright men in a respectable legislative body.&quot;

During his subsequent campaign for lieutenant governor, Bilbo commented on Washington Dorsey Gibbs, a state senator from Yazoo City. Gibbs was insulted and broke his cane over Bilbo&#x27;s head during an ensuing skirmish. But Bilbo&#x27;s campaign was successful, and he served as lieutenant governor from 1912 to 1916. One of his first acts as lieutenant governor was to remove from the records the resolution calling him &quot;unfit to sit with honest men.&quot;

==First governorship==
After serving as Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi for four years, Bilbo was elected governor in 1915. Cresswell (2006) argues that, in his first term (1916–1920), Bilbo had &quot;the most successful administration&quot; of all the governors who served between 1877 and 1917, putting state finances in order and supporting Progressive measures such as compulsory school attendance, a new charity hospital, and a board of bank examiners.

In his first term, his Progressive program was largely implemented. He was known as &quot;Bilbo the Builder&quot; because he authorized a state highway system, as well as limestone crushing plants, new dormitories at the Old Soldiers&#x27; Home, a tuberculosis hospital, and his work on eradication of the South American tick. Several other reforms were carried out during Bilbo’s time in office; affecting areas such as agriculture, education, taxation, public health, social welfare and labor rights.

In 1916 he pushed through a law eliminating public hangings. The Haynes Report, a call to national action in response to race riots throughout the summer of 1919, pointed to Bilbo as exemplifying the collective failure of the states to stop or even prosecute thousands of lawless executions over several decades. Before the mob lynching of John Hartfield in Ellisville, Mississippi, on June 26, 1919, according to the report, Bilbo said in a speech:
 Hartfield had purportedly entered into a consensual relationship with a local white woman; when the relationship was discovered, he fled but was tracked and kidnapped by a local mob. Hartfield was held and beaten before ultimately being publicly lynched without trial. Subsequently the mob burned and mutilated his remains, allegedly selling parts of his corpse as souvenirs. All this, including the premeditated murder, was done with the overt support of local authorities and was announced in the local papers the day prior.

==Congressional campaign and paternity suit==

The state constitution prohibited governors from having successive terms, so Bilbo chose to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1918. During the campaign, a bout of Texas fever broke out among cattle; Bilbo supported a program to dip cattle in insecticide to kill the ticks carrying the fever. Mississippi farmers were generally not happy about the idea, and Bilbo lost the primary to Paul B. Johnson Sr.

Lee M. Russell, then Governor, had served as Bilbo&#x27;s lieutenant governor and was being sued by his former secretary, who accused him of breach of promise and of seducing and impregnating her. She had undergone an abortion that prevented her from having further children. Russell asked Bilbo to convince the woman not to sue. Bilbo was unsuccessful, but Russell&#x27;s secretary was also unsuccessful in her suit.

Judge Edwin R. Holmes asked Bilbo to submit documents pertinent to the case. Bilbo refused and was later caught hiding in a barn to avoid a subpoena. Subsequently, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison for contempt of court and served ten days behind bars. He also lost his bid to return to the governorship in 1923.

==Second governorship==

In 1927, Bilbo was elected governor again after winning the Democratic primary election over Governor Dennis Murphree, who had succeeded to the top position from the lieutenant governorship on the death of Governor Henry L. Whitfield. Bilbo criticized Murphree for calling out the Mississippi National Guard to prevent a lynching in Jackson, declaring that no black person was worthy of protection by the Guard.

He also tried to move the University of Mississippi from Oxford to Jackson, although the idea never came to fruition.

During the 1928 presidential election, Bilbo helped Al Smith (D) from New York to carry the state by a large margin. Conservative, Protestant Democratic voters were considering abandoning Smith because he was Catholic and supported the repeal of prohibition. Bilbo spread the rumor that Republican candidate Herbert Hoover had socialized with a black woman, which helped keep Southern Democrats in Smith&#x27;s column.

In 1929, Thomas G. Gunter of Benton County, Mississippi, was convicted of the murder of his son-in-law, Marlin Drew, on the testimony of his seven-year-old granddaughter, Dorothy Louise. He was sentenced to five years in prison.

Three months later, after his daughter Pearl gave birth to her fourth child, she confessed that she had killed Marlin during an argument over the paternity of her then-unborn child and requested that her 63-year-old father be pardoned. Pearl said she had coached Dorothy Louise to implicate her father. She added it was always her intention to tell the truth after the birth of her baby and that she could not bear the thought of it beginning its life in prison. Governor Bilbo then granted Gunter a 90-day suspension of sentence as Pearl was bound over for an appearance before the Grand Jury. After the Grand Jury indicted Pearl for murder and perjury, Pearl was arraigned and pled guilty. The judge, however, used his statutory discretion and suspended Pearl&#x27;s sentence.

When Gunter&#x27;s 90-day suspension expired in February 1930, the governor denied his application for a pardon and ordered him to return to prison. The governor stated, &quot;Somebody ought to be in the penitentiary all the time for the murder of a sleeping man. If Judge Pegram does not believe Mrs. Drew is guilty enough to serve her term, then the man convicted of her murder will have to serve his term. Husbands ought to have some protection.&quot; Gunter, however, refused to return to the penitentiary, and as of February 1931, when an account of the case was written, he and Pearl had fled the state of Mississippi.

=== Firing the professors ===
In 1930, Bilbo convened a meeting of the State Board of Universities and Colleges to approve his plans to dismiss 179 faculty members. Appearing before reporters after the meeting, he announced, &quot;Boys, we&#x27;ve just hung up a new record. We&#x27;ve bounced three college presidents and made three new ones in the record time of two hours. And that&#x27;s just the beginning of what&#x27;s going to happen.&quot; The presidents of the University of Mississippi (&quot;Ole Miss&quot;), Mississippi A&amp;M (later Mississippi State University), and the Mississippi State College for Women were all fired and replaced, respectively, by a realtor, a press agent, and a recent B.A. degree-recipient. The Dean of the Medical School at Ole Miss was replaced by &quot;a man who once had a course in dentistry.&quot;

The Association of American Universities and the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools then suspended recognition of degrees from all four of Mississippi&#x27;s state colleges. The American Medical Association voted to cancel the state&#x27;s college of medicine accreditation.

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), meeting in Cleveland, passed a resolution that the remaining Mississippi professors would &quot;be regarded as retired members of the profession&quot; after finding that their dismissals had been made &quot;for political considerations and without concern for the welfare of the students.&quot;

During the crisis, Bilbo was burned in effigy by students at Ole Miss, but he was unconcerned about the state&#x27;s image. He made national headlines by giving an interview while &quot;sitting in a tub of hot water, soap in one hand, washrag in the other, and a cigar in his mouth.&quot; The lack of recognition continued until &quot;satisfactory evidence of improved conditions&quot; was provided to the AAUP and the other institutions in 1932.

In his final year of office, Bilbo and the legislature were at a stalemate when he refused to sign their tax bills, and the legislature refused to approve them. At the end of his term, the State of Mississippi was effectively bankrupt. The state treasury had only $1,326.57 in its coffers, and the state was $11.5 million in debt.

Bilbo, whose actions had halted U.S. Department of Agriculture funding of the agricultural school at Mississippi State, was hired as a &quot;consultant on public relations&quot; for the USDA for a short time. He clipped newspaper articles for a high salary, a reward from Senator Pat Harrison for Bilbo&#x27;s campaign support. Pundits dubbed him the &quot;Pastemaster General.&quot; Soon, Bilbo made plans to run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Hubert Stephens.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1934, Bilbo defeated Stephens to win a seat in the United States Senate. There he spoke against &quot;farmer murderers,&quot; &quot;poor-folks haters,&quot; &quot;shooters of widows and orphans,&quot; &quot;international well-poisoners,&quot; &quot;charity hospital destroyers,&quot; &quot;spitters on our heroic veterans,&quot; &quot;rich enemies of our public schools,&quot; &quot;private bankers &#x27;who ought to come out in the open and let folks see what they&#x27;re doing&#x27;,&quot; &quot;European debt-cancelers,&quot; &quot;unemployment makers,&quot; pacifists, Communists, munitions manufacturers, and &quot;skunks who steal Gideon Bibles from hotel rooms.&quot;

In Washington, Bilbo feuded with Mississippi senior Senator Pat Harrison. Bilbo, whose base was among tenant farmers, hated the upper-class Harrison, who represented the rich planters and merchants. The feud started in 1936 when Harrison nominated Judge Holmes for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Bilbo disliked Holmes, dating back to the Russell case, and spoke against him for five hours. Bilbo was the only Senator to vote &quot;no,&quot; and Holmes was confirmed.

Later that year, Harrison faced a primary challenge from former Governor Mike Conner. Bilbo supported Conner. Bilbo&#x27;s former law partner Stewart C. &quot;Sweep Clean&quot; Broom, campaigned for Harrison. Harrison won reelection.

When the Senate majority leader&#x27;s job opened up in 1937, Harrison ran and faced a close contest with Kentucky&#x27;s Alben Barkley. Harrison&#x27;s campaign manager asked Bilbo to consider voting for Harrison. Bilbo said he would vote for Harrison only if Harrison asked him personally. When asked if he would make the personal appeal to Bilbo, Harrison replied, &quot;Tell the son of a bitch I wouldn&#x27;t speak to him even if it meant the presidency of the United States.&quot; Harrison lost by one vote, 37-to-38, and his reputation as the Senator who wouldn&#x27;t speak to his home-state colleague remained intact. Bilbo had taken revenge by voting against his fellow Mississippian.

Bilbo&#x27;s outspoken support of segregation and white supremacy was controversial in the Senate. Attracted by the ideas of black separatists such as Marcus Garvey, Bilbo proposed an amendment to the federal work-relief bill on June 6, 1938, which would have deported twelve million black Americans to Liberia at federal expense to relieve unemployment. Bilbo wrote a book advocating the idea. Garvey praised him in return, saying that Bilbo had &quot;done wonderfully well for the Negro.&quot; But Thomas W. Harvey, a senior Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League leader in the US, distanced himself from Bilbo because of his racist speeches.

Bilbo continued to pursue the idea of repatriating African Americans, with support from black separatists such as Mittie Maude Lena Gordon, founder of the Peace Movement of Ethiopia. Gordon collaborated with Bilbo on his proposed legislation, the Greater Liberia Bill, and directed the Peace Movement of Ethiopia in a national grassroots campaign in support. Gordon’s support of Bilbo was motivated by her belief that only &quot;government aid&quot; could attain her foreign policy goal of African-American repatriation to West Africa. Her desire for this foreign policy measure was shaped by her belief in racial separatism, which she shared with Bilbo and which also attracted him to this foreign policy measure. However, his desire for racial separatism was motivated by his white supremacist views, but hers by a perception that African-Americans could never attain desirable social conditions in American society. Moreover, Gordon’s recognition of the power of government officials to help her attain her goal provoked her to use her gender in her communication with Bilbo in order to appeal to his masculinity. On April 24, 1939, Bilbo presented the bill to the Senate. It proposed relocating African Americans to Liberia and further suggested the purchase of 400,000 square miles of West African territory from France and Britain, credited on debt form World War I, for the emigrants. The movement was to be funded through federal expenditures, initially suggesting $1 billion, and encouraged support from &quot;any country in Europe that owes us a war debt&quot;. Black Americans between the ages of 21 and 50 would receive material aid, including a 50-acre land grant, and financial assistance for one year after reallocating. The bill failed to generate enough support and was unsuccessful.

The Democrats assigned Bilbo to the least essential Senate committee on the governance of the District of Columbia to limit his influence. Bilbo, however, used his position to advance his white supremacist views. Bilbo was against giving any vote to district residents, especially as the district&#x27;s black population was increasing because of the Great Migration. After re-election, he advanced to sufficient seniority to chair the committee, 1945–1947. He also served on the Pensions Committee, chairing it 1942–1945.

In his 1940 re-election bid, President Roosevelt praised Bilbo as &quot;a real friend of liberal government.&quot; Bilbo, in turn, boasted himself as being &quot;...100 percent for Roosevelt ... and the New Deal.&quot;
In the 1930s, Bilbo supported Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. He became known as the &quot;Redneck Liberal.&quot; After 1940, however, he moved steadily to the right regarding foreign policy, economic policy, and the rights of workers and unions. He became isolationist and opposed the draft and preparations for war. He increasingly voted with the Conservative Coalition that controlled domestic policy. He switched from a supporter to an opponent of labor unions. He ridiculed blacks, Jews and Italians and helped defeat the renewal of Roosevelt&#x27;s Fair Employment Practice Committee, which tried to abolish job discrimination based on race or ethnicity. He always favored agriculture, and he owned a large farm himself. As the war began, he complained that Roosevelt&#x27;s policies were driving up wages and reducing his profits. He supported programs sought by large farmers.

Bilbo revealed his membership in the Ku Klux Klan in an August 1946 interview on the radio program &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, saying, &quot;No man can leave the Klan. He takes an oath not to do that. Once a Ku Klux, always a Ku Klux.&quot;

He was a prominent participant in the lengthy southern Democratic filibuster of the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynching bill before the Senate in 1938, during which he argued, &quot;If you succeed in the passage of this bill, you will open the floodgates of hell in the South. Raping, mobbing, lynching, race riots, and crime will be increased a thousandfold&quot;.

Bilbo denounced Richard Wright&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Black Boy&quot; (1945), on the Senate floor. &quot;Its purpose is to plant the seeds of devilment and trouble-breeding in the days to come in the mind and heart of every American Negro ... It is the dirtiest, filthiest, lousiest, most obscene piece of writing that I have ever seen in print.&quot;

Bilbo was outspoken in saying that blacks should not be allowed to vote anywhere in the United States, regardless of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. Black World War II veterans complained of longstanding disfranchisement in the South, which Mississippi had achieved in 1890 by changes to its constitution related to electoral and voter registration rules, which the other Confederate states and Oklahoma followed with similar changes through 1910, most of which survived court challenges. Bilbo&#x27;s campaign was accused of provoking violence related to voting.

In 1946, he wrote to General MacArthur, head of the Allied occupation of Japan, that the Japanese should &quot;all be sterilized.&quot;

During the 1946 Democratic Senate primary in Mississippi, his last race, Bilbo was the subject of a series of attacks by journalist Hodding Carter in his paper, the Greenville &quot;Delta Democrat-Times.&quot; Dismayed that the Supreme Court had ruled that white primaries were unconstitutional, he urged his white supporters to prevent black citizens from voting. At least half of all black citizens were prevented from voting in the primary due to threats of violence. He won that primary against three other opponents with 51.0 percent of the vote. As usual, Bilbo faced no Republican opposition in the 1946 general election. Based on a request by liberal Democratic Senator Glen H. Taylor of Idaho, the newly elected Republican majority in the United States Senate refused to seat Bilbo for the term to which he was elected because of his speeches. He was believed to have incited violence against blacks who wanted to vote in the South. In addition, a committee found that he had taken bribes—one contractor gave him a Cadillac for Christmas in 1946. A filibuster by Southerners threatened to delay the seating of all the new senators. It was resolved when a supporter proposed that Bilbo&#x27;s credentials remain on the table while he returned to Mississippi to seek medical treatment for oral cancer.

==Death==

Bilbo retired to his &quot;Dream House&quot; estate in Poplarville, Mississippi, where he wrote and published a summary of his racial ideas entitled &quot;Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization&quot; (Dream House Publishing Company, 1947). His house, which served as the eponym and office of his publishing company, burned down in late fall that year, with the fire consuming many copies of the book.

Bilbo died at sixty-nine in New Orleans, Louisiana. On his deathbed, he summoned Leon Louis, the editor of the black newspaper &quot;Negro South&quot; to make a statement:

His funeral at Juniper Grove Cemetery in Poplarville was attended by five thousand mourners, including the governor and the junior senator. A bronze statue of Bilbo was placed in the rotunda of the Mississippi State Capitol building. It was relocated to another room now frequently used by the Legislative Black Caucus, and some members used the statue&#x27;s outstretched arm as a coat rack. The statue was moved to storage in 2021.

According to Charles Pope Smith, when he died:Theodore G. Bilbo was perhaps the most controversial public figure on the national scene...The extremism of his pronouncements on race relations had polarized much of the country...To the vast majority of southern whites Bilbo had become the leading spokesman in the fight to preserve that section&#x27;s structure of racial segregation from those who wanted to bring about racially equality. To liberal whites and blacks, on the other hand, Bilbo was America&#x27;s most vicious race-baiter.

==In popular culture==
Bilbo was satirized multiple times in popular culture.
* In 1946, he was the subject of Bob and Adrienne Claiborne&#x27;s song &quot;Listen Mr. Bilbo&quot; (1946), sung by Pete Seeger.
* Jack Webb devoted an episode of his crusading 1946 radio show &quot;One Out of Seven&quot; to attacking Bilbo&#x27;s racial views. He dramatized extracts from Bilbo&#x27;s speeches and letters attacking Negroes, &quot;Dagoes&quot; (Italians), and Jews, while asserting after each extract some variation of &quot; ... but Senator Bilbo is an honorable man. We do not intend to prove otherwise&quot;, a reference to Marc Antony&#x27;s funeral oration in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.
* In 1947, he was the subject of the blues song &quot;Bilbo Is Dead&quot; by Andrew Tibbs.
* Bilbo is the subject of the talking blues song &quot;Talking Bilbo&quot; by Lee Hays, included in the ten-disc compilation &quot;Songs for Political Action&quot; curated by Bear Family Records.
* He was also mentioned in the 1947 Gregory Peck film &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; as an exemplar of bigotry.
* In 2001, fantasy writer Andy Duncan published a satirical &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-themed short story titled &quot;Senator Bilbo&quot;, set after the events in the novel and featuring a hobbit, Senator Bilbo (not to be confused with Bilbo Baggins), who holds racial views that are similar to Theodore Bilbo&#x27;s.

<text>Luca Giordano (18 October 1634 – 3 January 1705) was an Italian late-Baroque painter and printmaker in etching. Fluent and decorative, he worked successfully in Naples, Rome, Florence, and Venice, before spending a decade in Spain.

==Early life and training==



Born in Naples, Giordano was the son of the painter Antonio Giordano. In around 1650 he was apprenticed to Ribera on the recommendation of the viceroy of Naples and his early work was heavily influenced by his teacher. Like Ribera, he painted many half-length figures of philosophers, either imaginary portraits of specific figures, or generic types.

He acquired the nickname &quot;Luca fa presto&quot;, which translates into &quot;Luca paints quickly.&quot; His speed, in design as well as handiwork, and his versatility, which enabled him to imitate other painters deceptively, earned for him two other epithets, &quot;The Thunderbolt&quot; (&quot;Fulmine&quot;) and &quot;The Proteus&quot; of painting.

Following a period studying in Rome, Parma and Venice, Giordano developed an elaborate Baroque style fusing Venetian and Roman influences. His mature work combines the ornamental pomp of Paul Veronese with the lively complex schemes, the &quot;grand manner&quot;, of Pietro da Cortona. He is also noted for his lively and showy use of colour.

==Florence==
In 1682–1683 Giordano painted various fresco series in Florence, including one in the dome of the Corsini Chapel of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence. In the large block occupied by the former Medici palace, he painted the ceiling of the Biblioteca Riccardiana (&quot;Allegory of Divine Wisdom&quot;) and the long gallery of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. The vast frescoes of the latter are contained in the 1670s gallery addition, overlooking the gardens. The planning was overseen by Alessandro Segni and commissioned by Francesco Riccardi. They include the prototypic hagiographic celebration of the Medici family in the center, surrounded by a series of interlocking narratives: allegorical figures (the &quot;Cardinal Virtues&quot;, the &quot;Elements of Nature&quot;) and mythological episodes (&quot;Neptune and Amphitrita&quot;, &quot;The Rape of Proserpine&quot;, &quot;The Triumphal procession of Bacchus&quot;, &quot;The Death of Adonis&quot;,&quot; Ceres&quot; and &quot;Triptolemus&quot;).

==Court painter in Spain (1692–1702)==
In 1692 Giordano went to Spain at the invitation of Charles II. He stayed there for ten years, returning to Naples in 1702, following Charles&#x27; death. While in Spain, he painted major decorative schemes at the Buen Retiro Palace, El Escorial, the sacristry of Toledo Cathedral and the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. &quot;The Allegory of the Golden Fleece&quot;, a c. 1694 fresco on the ceiling of the Casón del Buen Retiro is one of the possible reasons given for the building having survived when most of the other Buen Retiro palace complex buildings were demolished in the nineteenth century, now it&#x27;s an annex of the Prado Museum Complex that holds a library for researchers. He also painted part of the frescoes at the Church of Saint Anthony of the Germans and many pictures for the court, private patrons and churches. His pupils, Aniello Rossi and Matteo Pacelli, assisted him in Spain.

Giordano was popular at the Spanish court, and the king granted him the title of &quot;caballero&quot;. His works can be seen all around Madrid, and the Museo del Prado houses a large compilation of his works. Not far from there, the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando owns several of his works and in the neighboring Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum there is a &quot;Judging of Salomon&quot; long term loan, belonging to Baroness Carmen Thyssen Private Collection.

==Late work in Naples==
After his return to Naples early in 1702, Giordano continued to paint prolifically. Executed in a lighter, less rhetorical style, these late works, prefiguring Rococo, proved influential throughout the eighteenth century, and were admired by Fragonard.

He spent large sums in acts of munificence, and was particularly liberal to poorer artists. One of his maxims was that the good painter is the one whom the public like, and that the public are attracted more by colour than by design.

Giordano had an astonishing facility, which often lead to an impression of superficiality of his works. He left many works in Rome, and far more in Naples. Of the latter, his &quot;Christ expelling the Traders from the Temple&quot; in the church of the Padri Girolamini, a colossal work, full of expressive &quot;lazzaroni&quot; or beggars from Naples; also the frescoes of the &quot;Triumph of Judith&quot; at San 
Martino, and those in the Tesoro della Certosa, including the subject of &quot;Moses and the Brazen Serpent&quot;; and the cupola paintings in the Church of Santa Brigida. This church contains the artist&#x27;s own tomb. Other notable examples are the &quot;Judgment of Paris&quot; formerly in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, but destroyed in World War II, and &quot;Christ with the Doctors in the Temple&quot;, in the Palazzo Corsini, Rome. In later years, he painted influential frescoes for the Cappella Corsini, the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi and other works.
Giordano died in Naples in 1705. Sources differ as to whether he died on 3 January or 12 January 1705.

==Influence==
His best pupils in painting were Paolo de Matteis and Nicola Malinconico. However, his influence, like his travels and career, were broad and prolific. For example, he is said to have influenced in Venice, Sebastiano Ricci, Giovan Battista Langetti, Giovanni Coli, and Filippo Gherardi. Other pupils included Juan Antonio Boujas, Nunzio Ferraiuoli (Nunzio degli Afflitti), Ansel Fiammingo (il Franceschitto or Francesquitto), Giovanni Battista Lama, Andrea Miglionico, Giuseppe Simonelli, Andrea Vicenti, Andrea Viso, Tommaso Fasano, Tommaso Giaquinto, Domenico di Marino, Pietro di Martino, Pedro de Calabria, Matteo Pacelli, Francisco Tramulles, Nicolo Maria Rossi, Aniello Rossi, and Raimondo de Dominici.

As a young man, Giordano engraved works with considerable skill, including some of his own paintings, such as the &quot;Slaughter of the Priests of Baal&quot;. He also painted much on the crystal borderings of looking-glasses, cabinets and others seen in many Italian palaces, and was, in this form of art, the master of Pietro Garofalo.

==Critical reputation==
Giordano has been criticized as being a prolific trader of all styles, and master of none. Michael Levey remarks of him &quot;Giordano was the ideal rococo painter, speedy, prolific, dazzling in colour, assured in draughtsmanship, ever-talented and never touching the fringe of genius.&quot; He has been viewed as a proto-Tiepolo, reanimating that grand manner of Cortona in a style that would brighten with Tiepolo.

<text>Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) is a software tool for parallel networking of computers. It is designed to allow a network of heterogeneous Unix and/or Windows machines to be used as a single distributed parallel processor. Thus large computational problems can be solved more cost effectively by using the aggregate power and memory of many computers. The software is very portable; the source code, available free through netlib, has been compiled on everything from laptops to Crays.

PVM enables users to exploit their existing computer hardware to solve much larger problems at less additional cost. PVM has been used as an educational tool to teach parallel programming but has also been used to solve important practical problems. It was developed by the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Emory University. The first version was written at ORNL in 1989, and after being rewritten by University of Tennessee, version 2 was released in March 1991. Version 3 was released in March 1993, and supported fault tolerance and better portability.

PVM was a step towards modern trends in distributed processing and grid computing but has, since the mid-1990s, largely been supplanted by the much more successful MPI standard for message passing on parallel machines. PVM is free software, released under both the BSD License and the GNU General Public License.

== Design ==

PVM is a software system that enables a collection of heterogeneous computers to be used as a coherent and flexible concurrent computational resource, or a &quot;parallel virtual machine&quot;.

The individual computers may be shared-memory or local-memory multiprocessors, vector supercomputers, specialized graphics engines, or scalar workstations and PCs, that may be interconnected by a variety of networks, such as Ethernet or FDDI.

PVM consists of a run-time environment and library for message passing, task and resource management, and fault notification. While PVM will not automatically make a commercial software package run faster, it &quot;does&quot; provide a powerful set of functions for manually parallelizing an existing source program, or for writing new parallel/distributed programs.

The PVM software must be specifically installed on every machine that is to be used in a given &quot;virtual machine&quot;. There is no &quot;automatic&quot; installation of executables onto remote machines in PVM, although simply copying the codice_1 and codice_2 directories to another &quot;similar&quot; machine (and setting codice_3 and codice_4) is sufficient for running PVM programs. Compiling or building PVM programs requires the full PVM installation.

User programs written in C, C++, or Fortran can access PVM through provided library routines.

PVM also supports broadcasting (PVM_bcast) which sends to all processes in a group and multicasting (PVM_mcast) which sends to a specific list of processes.

<doc id="221477" wikidata="Q2605546" url="?curid=221477" title="Wesley Wyndam-Pryce">
<text>Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (also spelled Wyndam-Price and Wyndham-Price) is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Played by Alexis Denisof, Wesley first appeared in the fourteenth episode of &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s third season in 1999, appearing in nine episodes before moving over to spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot; where he became a main character for all five seasons. Following &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s final season, the character&#x27;s story is continued in the 2007 canonical comic book series &quot;&quot;.

Wesley is introduced as a member of the Watchers&#x27; Council — an organization which trains Slayers to fight monsters such as vampires and demons. Created as an irritating foil for the character of Rupert Giles, he was intended to be killed off shortly after his first appearance, but the character was popular with his creators and television viewers, and was instead written into &quot;Angel&quot;, in which he joined a supernatural detective agency. Over the course of &quot;Angel&quot;, Wesley went through dramatic character developments, becoming darker and less comedic.

==Appearances==
===Television===
Wesley is introduced in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; season 3 (1998–1999) episode &quot;Bad Girls&quot; as the new Watcher of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Faith (Eliza Dushku). Pompous and ineffective, he fails to elicit any respect from either his Slayers or his predecessor, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), all of whom frequently ridicule and undermine him. He develops a crush on high school senior Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), and their mutual flirting throughout the season culminates in a pair of awkward kisses in the finale &quot;Graduation Day, Part Two&quot;. When Faith goes rogue after accidentally killing a human being, the Scooby Gang neglect to inform Wesley, and his subsequent interference ruins Faith&#x27;s brief chance at redemption. When Wesley fails to convince the Watchers&#x27; Council to help save the life of her vampire lover Angel (David Boreanaz), an enraged Buffy severs all ties with them. Despite this, Wesley offers his assistance in the fight against the Mayor, proving entirely useless in battle when he is knocked down almost instantly.

Wesley reappears in the first season (1999–2000) of spin-off show &quot;Angel&quot;, in the episode &quot;Parting Gifts&quot;. Introduced as a self-proclaimed &quot;rogue demon-hunter&quot;, Wesley reveals that he was fired from the Watchers&#x27; Council for incompetence, but is soon accepted into supernatural detective agency Angel Investigations, working alongside Angel and Cordelia (effectively filling the gap left by the death of Doyle (Glenn Quinn). When Faith is hired by evil law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart to assassinate Angel, Wesley is kidnapped and tortured by his former charge, until Angel forces Faith to take responsibility for her actions. Although still bitter towards her and doubtful of her chances at redemption, Wesley proves his loyalty to Angel by betraying his former colleagues at the Watchers&#x27; Council to protect Faith. In the second season (2000–2001), Wesley embarks on a romantic relationship with a woman named Virginia Bryce after helping to prevent her father from sacrificing her to a demon. When Angel descends into darkness and fires the team, Wesley continues Angel Investigations with Cordelia and Charles Gunn (J. August Richards). Having overcome his cowardice of earlier episodes, he gets himself shot trying to protect Gunn and spends the next two episodes in a wheelchair; this injury also leads to the demise of his relationship with Virginia, who becomes disturbed by his dangerous lifestyle. When Angel returns to the fold, Wesley is appointed team leader, but feels inferior due to his father&#x27;s berating and Angel&#x27;s habit of taking charge. However, when put in charge of a rebellion in the demon dimension Pylea, Wesley proves to be an effective, albeit ruthless, leader.

In &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s third season (2001–2002), Wesley&#x27;s path becomes filled with tragedies and difficult choices. Just as he starts developing romantic feelings for his teammate Fred (Amy Acker), he finds himself mystically influenced to kill her after a demon influences him to become homicidally misogynistic. While studying the birth of Angel&#x27;s infant son Connor, Wesley discovers a prophecy which claims that Angel will kill the baby. Intending to take him to safety, Wesley betrays his friends and kidnaps Connor, a decision which has disastrous consequences when he has his throat slit and the baby is kidnapped into a hell dimension by Angel&#x27;s sworn enemy, Holtz. Angel then attempts to kill him while he is in recovery at the hospital. Alienated from Angel Investigations, a recovered Wesley forms his own team to fight evil, but maintains an interest in his former friends&#x27; affairs. He also begins a sexual relationship with Wolfram &amp; Hart lawyer Lilah Morgan (Stephanie Romanov), who tries to convince him to join the firm. In the fourth season (2002–2003), Angel is rescued and revived by Wesley after being sunk to the bottom of the ocean by his now-adolescent son Connor (Vincent Kartheiser). Wesley eventually returns to the team full-time to help them battle the Beast, making difficult decisions such as seeking the aid of Angel&#x27;s evil alter ego Angelus and breaking Faith out of prison. Having developed genuine feelings for Lilah, he mourns her when she is killed by Cordelia, now possessed by the entity known as Jasmine (Gina Torres). In the season finale, following the defeat of Jasmine, Wesley joins the rest of Angel Investigations in taking over Wolfram &amp; Hart in the hopes that they can turn it into a power for good.

Season 5 (2003–2004) sees Wesley suffer yet more loss. In the episode &quot;Lineage&quot;, Wesley&#x27;s father makes his first appearance after being alluded to in earlier episodes. Roger Wyndam-Pryce (Roy Dotrice) is revealed to have sinister intentions when he tries to steal Angel&#x27;s free will and threatens to murder Fred; Wesley responds by shooting him dead, only to discover he was not actually his father, but a cyborg copy. Despite the deception having been revealed, he is visibly shaken by his willingness to end his father&#x27;s life to save another. After being in love with her for almost two seasons, Wesley finally gets together with Fred in the subsequent episode &quot;Smile Time&quot;, only to watch her die in the next episode when she is taken over by the ancient demon Illyria. He retaliates by killing Knox, the man responsible for raising Illyria, and stabbing Gunn after discovering he played an indirect role in Fred&#x27;s death. Descending into alcoholism, Wesley holds onto Illyria as the only thing he has left of Fred, helping her understand the human world she is unfamiliar with. He inadvertently restores his and his friends&#x27; memories of Connor when he smashes the Orlon Window, thinking that Angel had betrayed his trust. Wesley visibly feels guilty after remembering how he betrayed his friends by taking Connor from Angel and realizes his own role in causing Fred&#x27;s death, and later apologizes to Gunn for stabbing him. Towards the end of the season, Angel proposes an attack against the Circle of the Black Thorn, a powerful group of demons under the employ of the Wolfram &amp; Hart&#x27;s Senior Partners. In the show&#x27;s final episode, Wesley does battle with the warlock Cyvus Vail (Dennis Christopher) and is mortally wounded. He spends his dying moments with Illyria at his side, finally agreeing to let the demon take the form of Fred, thus allowing Wesley, in some way, to say goodbye to the woman he loved.

Joss Whedon revealed in an interview that Wesley was originally intended to survive and appear in &quot;Angel&quot; season 6, but he was inspired to kill Wesley off after being pitched the idea of his death scene by one of the script writers.

===Literature===

Wesley appears in comic books and novels based on the &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; television series. He appears in numerous &quot;Angel&quot; novels as a member of Angel Investigations, but has a more prominent role in some; in &quot;Stranger to the Sun&quot; he falls under a mystical slumber after receiving a mysterious package in the mail and becomes trapped in a nightmare, while &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; sees his love of reading get the better of him after being sucked into a book about the occult. The comic book &quot;&quot; focuses on Wesley&#x27;s struggles to save the life of Fred&#x27;s love interest and (unbeknownst to Wesley) future murderer, Knox. &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is a series of &quot;Buffy&quot; novels set in an alternate future where Wesley is Watcher to the current Slayer, Anna.

&quot;&quot; (2007-2011), a canonical comic book continuation of the television series, reveals that Wesley was unable to move on after his death due to the standard perpetuity clause in his Wolfram &amp; Hart contract. Now incorporeal, Wesley acts as the last remaining link to Senior Partners, who have sent Angel and all of Los Angeles to hell as punishment for their attack in season 5. Following the destruction of the Wolfram &amp; Hart building at the hands of a now vampiric Gunn, Wesley&#x27;s ghost fades away. He convinces the White Room to send him back to Hell, where his sudden appearance causes Illyria to change back and forth between Illyria and Fred&#x27;s personae. When Angel is confronted by Gunn, now a deluded vampire who believes he is the champion of the Shanshu prophecy, Wesley delivers Angel a vision from the Senior Partners explaining that the prophecy has always concerned Angel. When Angel realizes that the Senior Partners need him alive for their plans, he devises a plan to get himself killed, thus forcing them to rewind time to the last moment before Los Angeles was sent to hell. However, this would not reverse Wesley&#x27;s death. Wesley is resigned to his fate, believing that he has nothing more to live for now that Fred is gone, and walks away, but not before asking Spike to take care of Illyria. In the new timeline, Angel names a wing of the Los Angeles public library in memory of Wesley and Fred.

==Concept and creation==
Wesley was initially designed to be a foil for the character of Rupert Giles. Actor Alexis Denisof comments that Wesley and Giles come from very similar backgrounds, but have gone in different directions &quot;with the tools that they had&quot;; he was conceived as a &quot;nemesis&quot; for Giles and Buffy. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, who wrote Wesley&#x27;s first episode &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, explains, &quot;The way Faith is a reflection of Buffy, Wesley takes up a lot of the space that Giles traditionally occupies.&quot; He elaborates that, because Giles is usually the &quot;stuffy guy from England who tells you to sit up straight and obey the rules&quot;, introducing Wesley, who embodies those traits &quot;to the nth degree&quot;, allows Giles to become &quot;subversive&quot; and &quot;cool&quot;. Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.
Alexis Denisof, who had been living in England before coming to L.A., was unaware of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; since it had not yet aired in Britain. When actor Tony Head found out that Mutant Enemy were looking for an actor to play Wesley, Head contacted Denisof, an old friend from England, to ask whether he would be interested in the role. Denisof claims that Wesley was originally supposed to &quot;come in, irritate Giles and Buffy for a couple shows, and then be gloriously terminated&quot;. However, the writers became fond of the character&#x27;s &quot;curious humour&quot; and found themselves unable to kill him off. Joss Whedon struggled to find a place for Wesley in the series where he wouldn&#x27;t clash with Giles, and eventually approached Denisof with the offer of appearing in spin-off show &quot;Angel&quot;. For Wesley to work as a long-term character, Denisof claimed they had to re-shape the character to be more sympathetic.

==Characterization==
Wesley matures significantly over the course of both &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;; in his early appearances he was largely cowardly and incompetent. Alexis Denisof claims that his initial goal in playing the character was to be as annoying as possible for the other characters. He explains,

I thought that an irritating version of Giles would be annoying for [Giles] and also for Buffy. Wesley&#x27;s purpose was to come there and point the finger and get things shipshape. He&#x27;s a by-the-book school teacher. Considering what kind of person it would be who would have dedicated his life to this peculiar task of being a Watcher, and what would be the unique characteristics of somebody who had made those decisions, and then was taken out of that environment and put into Sunnydale. To Wesley that was a completely new and bizarre place.

During this time, Denisof came up with a background story for Wesley regarding his father to explain &quot;why he was so repressed.&quot; The writers used this story in the show, alluding to it in early &quot;Angel&quot; episodes such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot;, and &quot;Belonging&quot;. While discussing Wesley&#x27;s character development over the course of &quot;Angel&quot;, Denisof explains: &quot;I decided that Wesley was internally confronting his father and that released him a little bit and made him less repressed.&quot;

Wesley is introduced in &quot;Angel&quot; having been fired from the Watcher&#x27;s Council. Denisof says the experience gave the character &quot;a little shake&quot;. He elaborates,

When he arrived in Sunnydale, he was straight out of Watcher grad school; he lacked practical experience. He was living in the ideal of the perfect way to execute his duties. I think that losing his job and going out alone roughened him up a little, lopped off some of his sharper corners. It made him more approachable and more personable, less sure of himself all the time. 

Coming into the show immediately following the death of Doyle, Wesley serves as a partial replacement for that character. Comparing the two characters, Denisof states, &quot;Wesley is a clearer counterpart to Angel, whereas Doyle had more street smarts. Although [Doyle] was struggling with his demon nature, he had seen a lot more of the world in the same way Angel had.&quot; Nonetheless, Denisof believes that in this period, his character &quot;was so anxious to be a tough rogue demon hunter but was clearly a kind of soft puppy dog.&quot;

Denisof complimented the season 3 &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Billy&quot;, in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after becoming supernaturally misogynous, &quot;because it was the first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with&quot;. Discussing Wesley&#x27;s betrayal of his friends to protect Angel&#x27;s baby, Denisof explains,

It isn&#x27;t that he&#x27;s purely bad or purely good, we&#x27;re discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren&#x27;t as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all – i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son – and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it&#x27;s grey rather than black or white.

Science fiction magazine &quot;Starburst&quot; said that &quot;somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley&quot;. Denisof says of the period, &quot;It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character&#x27;s darker layers. You couldn&#x27;t have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters.&quot; Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was &quot;more or less isolated from the [main cast], barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we&#x27;d chew each other out. There&#x27;s definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world.&quot; Wesley&#x27;s dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram &amp; Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because &quot;we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had to put our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group.&quot; Discussing the way Wesley&#x27;s English accent softens over the course of &quot;Angel&quot;, Denisof says,

[The modified accent] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he&#x27;s spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn&#x27;t surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it&#x27;s understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, as a result of his environment.

Denisof had earlier stated that he thought &quot;it&#x27;s better for the father [of Wesley] to be kept in the background and not become part of the story.&quot; When Wesley&#x27;s father finally did appear in &quot;Angel&quot; season 5, he said:

I had mixed feelings [at first]. It was a lot of pressure to have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can&#x27;t necessarily control. Wesley&#x27;s a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That&#x27;s one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we&#x27;re children. The shooting [of the cyborg Wesley believed to be his father] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father – I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.

Wesley undergoes yet another drastic personality change in &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s fifth season following the death of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably &quot;unbalanced&quot;. &quot;By the time we get to the last few episodes, he&#x27;s got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way,&quot; says Denisof. &quot;But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there&#x27;s nothing more for him to lose.&quot; Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a &quot;much deeper, darker place&quot; than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, &quot;The Girl in Question&quot;. Denisof continues,

They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That was going to be a fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [the WB] decided to cancel the show.

The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley&#x27;s death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, &quot;It was very upsetting to read. It&#x27;s too good a story because it hurts.&quot;

<text>Harvey Forbes Fierstein ( ; born June 6, 1952) is an American actor, playwright, and screenwriter, known for his distinctive gravelly voice. He gained notice for his theater work in &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, winning both the Tony Award for Best Play and Best Actor in a Play. He went on to win the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical for &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, then Best Actor in a Musical for playing Edna Turnblad in &quot;Hairspray&quot;, a role he reprised for the &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot; television special.

On film he appeared in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and as the voice of Yao in &quot;Mulan&quot; and &quot;Mulan II&quot;.

Fierstein also wrote the books for the Tony Award-winning musicals &quot;Kinky Boots, Newsies&quot;, and Tony Award-nominated, Drama League Award-winner &quot;A Catered Affair.&quot; He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Early life and education==
Harvey Fierstein was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Jacqueline Harriet (née Gilbert), a school librarian, and Irving Fierstein, a handkerchief manufacturer. Fierstein has a brother, Ronald Fierstein. The family belonged to a Conservative Jewish temple. Prior to puberty, Fierstein was a soprano in a professional boys&#x27; choir.

Fierstein graduated from the High School of Art and Design and received a BFA from the Pratt Institute in 1973.

==Career==
As one of the first openly gay celebrities in the United States, Fierstein helped turn gay and lesbian life into a viable subject for contemporary drama &quot;with no apologies and no climactic suicides&quot;.

Fierstein has authored op-eds for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the PBS series &quot;In the Life&quot;.

===1970s===
Fierstein began working in the theater as a founding member of The Gallery Players of Park Slope before being cast in Andy Warhol&#x27;s only play, &quot;Pork&quot;. Fierstein&#x27;s other early roles included &quot;a transvestite in his own Flatbush Tosca...a 300-year-old woman, Lillian Russell, and 26 other parts in Ronald Tavel&#x27;s &quot;My Fetus Lived on Amboy Street&quot;&quot;. Fierstein also performed his own drag routine in Greenwich Village, including an impersonation of Ethel Merman singing &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get a Man With a Gun&quot;.

===1980s===

Fierstein is known for the play and film &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, which he wrote and starred in both off-Broadway (with a young Matthew Broderick) and on Broadway (with Estelle Getty and Fisher Stevens). The 1982 Broadway production won him two Tony Awards, for Best Play and Best Actor in a Play; two Drama Desk Awards, for Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Actor in a Play; and the Theatre World Award. Fierstein is the first gay actor to win a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. The film adaptation of &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination as Best Male Lead.

Fierstein also wrote the book for &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1983), winning another Tony Award, this time for Best Book of a Musical, and a Drama Desk nomination for Outstanding Book. During his Tony Award acceptance speech, Fierstein acknowledged his male lover; according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, this was &quot;not a first&quot;, but was &quot;still startling to many viewers&quot;.

Fierstein narrated the documentary &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&quot; (1984), for which he won a News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award. His playwriting credits include &quot;Spookhouse&quot; (1984), &quot;Safe Sex&quot; (1987), and &quot;Forget Him&quot; (1988). &quot;Legs Diamond&quot;, his 1988 collaboration with Peter Allen, was a critical and commercial failure, closing after 72 previews and 64 performances, but the songs live on in Peter Allen&#x27;s biographical musical, &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;.

===1990s===
Fierstein was praised for his 1990 role as the voice of Karl, Homer Simpson&#x27;s assistant, in the &quot;Simpson and Delilah&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Fierstein portrayed Mark Newberger in &quot;Cheers&quot;, earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1992.

In 1993, Fierstein co-starred with Mara Wilson, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, and Robin Williams in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;.

In 1994, Fierstein became the first gay actor to play a principal gay character in a television series when he appeared as fashion designer Dennis Sinclair in the short-lived CBS series &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girls&quot;.

Fierstein voiced the role of Yao in Disney&#x27;s animated feature &quot;Mulan&quot;, a role he later reprised for the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and the direct-to-DVD sequel &quot;Mulan II&quot;.

Fierstein voiced the character of Elmer in the 1999 HBO special based on his children&#x27;s book &quot;The Sissy Duckling&quot;, which won the Humanitas Prize for Children&#x27;s Animation.

===2000s===

Fierstein&#x27;s Broadway acting credits include playing the mother, Edna Turnblad, in &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2002), for which he won a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. He later replaced Alfred Molina as Tevye in the 2004 revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

In 2007, Fierstein wrote the book to the musical &quot;A Catered Affair&quot;; he also starred in the production. After tryouts at San Diego&#x27;s Old Globe Theatre in September 2007, the show opened on Broadway April 17, 2008. It received 12 Drama Desk Award nominations and won the Drama League Award for Distinguished Production of a Musical.

Fierstein returned to the theater when he reprised the role of Tevye, replacing an injured Chaim Topol, in the national tour of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; starting in December 2009.

===2010s===
On February 15, 2011, Fierstein replaced Douglas Hodge as Albin/Zaza in the Broadway revival of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;. The show closed on May 1, 2011, after playing 433 performances and 15 previews.

Fierstein wrote the book for the stage musical &quot;Newsies&quot;, along with Alan Menken (music) and Jack Feldman (lyrics). The musical opened on Broadway in March 2012. Fierstein was nominated for the Tony Award for Book of a Musical.

Fierstein wrote the book for a stage musical version of the film &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; with music and lyrics by Cyndi Lauper. After a fall 2012 run at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago, it opened at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on Broadway in April 2013. The musical was nominated for thirteen 2013 Tony Awards and won six, including best musical.

Fierstein&#x27;s play &quot;Casa Valentina&quot; was produced on Broadway by the Manhattan Theatre Club at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. The play opened in April 2014. It was directed by Joe Mantello, with a cast that featured Patrick Page, John Cullum, and Mare Winningham.

Fierstein wrote the teleplay for the December 3, 2015, NBC TV broadcast of &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot;, featuring Stephanie Mills as Aunt Em, Queen Latifah as The Wiz, and David Alan Grier as the Lion. The teleplay is an adaptation of &quot;The Wiz&quot;, which ran on Broadway from October 1974 until January 1979.

Fierstein then wrote the teleplay for, and starred in, the 2016 NBC TV broadcast of &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot; with Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Kristin Chenoweth, and Martin Short.

In April 2016, Fierstein, along with his &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; collaborator Cyndi Lauper, was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Fierstein wrote and starred in &quot;Bella Bella&quot;, a solo monologue play about New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug. It premiered at Manhattan Theatre Club&#x27;s Stage One at City Center on October 1, 2019, directed by Kimberly Senior.

===2020s===
Fierstein&#x27;s book &quot;I Was Better Last Night: A Memoir&quot; was released on March 1, 2022, and quickly became a New York Times Bestseller.

== Personal life ==
Fierstein is gay. He reportedly dated journalist Ted Casablanca from 1987 to 1992.

Fierstein is Jewish. In 2005, he said that although he does not believe in God, he prays three or four times each day.

Fierstein&#x27;s distinctive gravelly voice is a result of an overdeveloped vestibular fold in his vocal cords, essentially giving him a &quot;double voice&quot; when he speaks.

Fierstein has struggled with alcohol abuse. In a 2022 interview, he stated that he stopped drinking alcohol following a 1996 suicide attempt.

Speaking with &quot;People&quot; magazine in February 2022 to promote his memoir &quot;I Was Better Last Night&quot;, Fierstein stated, &quot;I&#x27;m still confused as to whether I&#x27;m a man or a woman,&quot; and that as a child he often wondered if he&#x27;d been born in the wrong body. &quot;When I was a kid, I was attracted to men. I didn&#x27;t feel like a boy was supposed to feel. Then I found out about gay. So that was enough for me for then&quot;. The interview also noted his ease at playing both Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and Edna Turnblad in &quot;Hairspray&quot;. He avoided identifying as non-binary in the interview, saying he had thought about it a lot and &quot;it&#x27;s the term that bothers me&quot;, but concluded that &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve missed anything by not making up my mind&quot;. On the &quot;LGBTQ&amp;A&quot; podcast the following month, Fierstein said, &quot;I&#x27;m comfortable being me and if I ask myself, &#x27;Would you want to transition?&#x27; The answer&#x27;s no&quot;.

<text>Sleeping Murder: Miss Marple&#x27;s Last Case is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in October 1976 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed for £3.50 and the US edition for $7.95.

The book features Miss Marple. Released posthumously, it was the last published Christie novel, although not the last Miss Marple novel in order of writing. The story is explicitly set in 1944 but the first draft of the novel was possibly written during the Blitz in 1940. Miss Marple aids a young couple who choose to uncover events in the wife&#x27;s past life, and not let sleeping murder lie.

==Plot summary==
Newlywed Gwenda Reed travels ahead of her husband to find a home for them on the south coast of England. In a short time, she finds and buys Hillside, a large old house that feels just like home. She supervises workers in a renovation, staying in a one-time nursery room while the work progresses. She forms a definite idea for the little nursery. When the workmen open a long sealed door, she sees the very wallpaper that was in her mind. Furthermore, a place that seems logical to her for a doorway between two rooms proves to have been one years earlier. She goes to London for a visit with relatives, the author Raymond West, his wife, and his aunt, Miss Jane Marple. During a performance of the play &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, when the line &quot;Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young&quot; is spoken, Gwenda screams out; she saw an image of herself viewing a man saying those words strangling a blonde-haired woman named Helen.

Gwenda was born in India where her father was stationed; then from a toddler&#x27;s age, once her mother died, was raised in New Zealand by her mother&#x27;s sister. Her father died a few years after her mother. She has memories of being on a ship, but it is clearly two ships. Miss Marple suggests that Gwenda lived in England with her father and his second wife, which proves to be the case. Her stepmother, Helen Halliday née Kennedy, met her father travelling from India back to England, where their shipboard romance led to marriage upon arrival in England. They rented a house in Dillmouth, where Helen grew up. The coincidences prove to be memories from Gwenda&#x27;s stay in that house 18 years ago as a very young child. Now Gwenda ponders her frightening image and the closing words of the play: are they real memories as well? Her husband Giles arrives from New Zealand, and the couple decide to pursue this mystery.

Helen was raised mainly by her half-brother, Dr Kennedy, now retired from practice and moved to another village. He replies to an advertisement placed by Giles seeking information about Helen.

Miss Marple arranges to visit friends in Dillmouth. Miss Marple is often at the house, pulling out bindweed from the neglected garden. She finds the man who once gardened for the Kennedy family, sister and brother, who supplies several useful descriptions of events then. Miss Marple finds the cook from the Halliday household, Edith, who remembers that time well. The Hallidays were soon to move to a house in Norfolk before Helen disappeared. Helen wanted to get away. The servants presumed this was from her husband, but it was not. She was mainly interested in escaping her brother. She did fall in love with Halliday, and loved his daughter.

The Reeds advertise, seeking the Hallidays&#x27; former maid Lily. She writes first to Dr Kennedy, thinking he is a friend. She says that she does not believe that Helen ran off, as the clothes packed in her suitcase made no sense (taking an evening gown but not the shoes and belt that go with it). The Reeds and Dr Kennedy agree he should write back to her to arrange a meeting at his present home. Lily never arrives.

The police find Lily&#x27;s body, strangled, in a copse near the train station. She came by an earlier train, but had Dr Kennedy&#x27;s letter with her, for the later arrival time. Miss Marple advises Gwenda to tell the police everything. Soon they are digging up the garden, at the end of the terrace, to find Helen&#x27;s body. Gwenda is in the house alone when Dr Kennedy approaches her, ready to kill her by strangling when his attempt to poison her failed. Miss Marple arrives with a container of soapy solution, which she sprays in his eyes to stop the murder attempt.

Dr Kennedy had strangled his sister, saying the closing words from that play, unaware of young Gwenda at the stair railing above. He buried Helen in the garden. He set up her husband to think he had strangled her, but there was no body, so he was taken as insane, and died in a nursing home. His diary from that time showed him to be quite sane, but he could not explain what he had seen, his strangled wife next to him. Kennedy had first given drugs to make Halliday paranoid, and then drugged his drink so Dr Kennedy could pose him next to the strangled Helen. Then Kennedy moved her body again. The letter found with Lily was not the one she received from Kennedy; he switched it after he killed her. He knew the police would see through his scheme. He sent the nanny Leonie home to Switzerland with medicines that killed her. Miss Marple explains all this to the Reeds, the full confession from Kennedy and how they should have seen it from the start, from those words in the play (spoken by a brother who had just killed his sister).

==Writing and publication process==
&quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, like &quot;Curtain&quot; (Hercule Poirot&#x27;s last mystery, which concludes the sleuth&#x27;s career and life), was written by Christie during the Second World War, apparently sometime during the Blitz, which took place between September 1940 and May 1941. Agatha Christie&#x27;s literary correspondence files indicate that the initial draft of the novel was written early in 1940.

Christie&#x27;s notebooks are open to interpretation in hindsight; John Curran argues that &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; was still being planned at the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. His basis is the many changes to the title of the novel, since other authors had used her first title ideas: one of Christie&#x27;s notebooks contain references to &quot;Cover Her Face&quot; (second title) under &quot;Plans for Sept. 1947&quot; and &quot;Plans for Nov. 1948&quot;, suggesting she was planning to re-read and revise the manuscript.

Previous biographers, who did not have access to the Notebooks, state that &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; was written in 1940.

Nevertheless, support for the story being first written in 1940 is found in the correspondence files of Christie&#x27;s literary agents: Christie&#x27;s royalty statement for 15 March 1940 states that the secretarial agency hired by Edmund Cork to type up &quot;Murder in Retrospect&quot; (the first title of the manuscript) charged £19 13s. 9d. On 7 June 1940, Edmund Cork wrote to Christie advising her that he would have the necessary &#x27;deed of gift&#x27; drawn up so her husband Max would become the owner of the unpublished Miss Marple novel. Christie eventually visited Edmund Cork&#x27;s offices at 40 Fleet Street, London, on 14 October 1940 and signed the document transferring ownership of the copyright of &quot;Murder in Retrospect&quot; to her husband in consideration of what was termed her &quot;natural love and affection for him&quot;.

Christie refers in her autobiography to the last Poirot and Miss Marple novels that she penned during the Second World War. She writes that she had written an extra two books during the first years of the war in anticipation of being killed in the raids, for at the time she was working in London. One, which she wrote first, was for her daughter, Rosalind Hicks – a book with Hercule Poirot in it – and the other, with Miss Marple in it, was for Max. She adds that these two books, after being composed, were put in the vaults of a bank, and were made over formally by deed of gift to her daughter and husband.

The last Marple novel Christie wrote, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, was published in 1971, followed by Christie&#x27;s last Poirot novel &quot;Elephants Can Remember&quot; in 1972 and then, in 1973, her very last novel &quot;Postern of Fate&quot;. Aware that she would write no more novels, Christie authorised the publication of &quot;Curtain&quot; in 1975 to send off Poirot. She then arranged to have &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; published in 1976, but she died before its publication in October of that year.

By contrast to Poirot, who dies in the final novel, Miss Marple lives on. This last published novel is set in 1944, but follows novels set in later years, which show Miss Marple to have aged. In &quot;Nemesis&quot;, Miss Marple does no gardening on the advice of her doctor, showing her to be in more fragile health. In &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, she is frequently pulling bindweed from the neglected garden at the Reeds&#x27; home, but that may be a cover for searching for the site of the victim&#x27;s burial. There is a reference to a wireless set as a desired purchase by Lily, were she to receive money by responding to the newspaper notice seeking her; this reinforces the story&#x27;s setting being in the 1930s, as the author intended in her final revisions (done in 1950).

==Title changes==
Christie&#x27;s original manuscript of &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; was entitled &quot;Murder in Retrospect&quot; after one of the chapters in the book. When the Hercule Poirot novel &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; was later serialised in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from September to November 1941, the magazine&#x27;s editing board retitled it &quot;Murder in Retrospect&quot;. This was also the title used by Christie&#x27;s American publisher Dodd Mead and Company, presumably in order to capitalise on the recent US serialisation. Christie&#x27;s original manuscript of &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; was duly retitled &quot;Cover Her Face&quot;.

Following the publication of P.D. James&#x27;s début crime novel &quot;Cover Her Face&quot; in 1962, Christie became aware of the need to think up yet another title for the last Miss Marple book. She wrote to Edmund Cork on 17 July 1972, asking him to send her a copy of the unpublished Miss Marple manuscript and a copy of Max&#x27;s deed of gift. So much time had passed that she was unable to remember if the manuscript was still called &quot;Cover Her Face&quot; or &quot;She Died Young&quot;.

==Allusions to other works==
* When the police inspector sees Miss Marple he comments on a case of poison pen near Lymstock, which is the plot of &quot;The Moving Finger&quot;.
* Early in the novel, Miss Marple has a brief conversation with Colonel Arthur Bantry, her neighbour in St Mary Mead, whose death was referenced in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot;, published in 1962, emphasising the 1945 setting of &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;. Detective Inspector Primer mentions that Colonel Melrose pointed her out to him in the past, after telling Gwenda that Miss Marple was well known to the Chief Constables of three counties, who relied on her, but was not yet his chief.
* In &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, the concept of an unknown person, X, is briefly used by the characters figuring out what happened to Helen. In &quot;Curtain&quot;, Poirot&#x27;s last case, written about the same time, Captain Hastings refers to the murderer Poirot seeks as Mr X. The notation is used throughout &quot;Curtain&quot;, but just briefly in &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;. In both novels, X proved to be a character already well-known to other characters in the novel.
* The plot of John Webster&#x27;s 17th-century play &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; concerns a woman who is strangled by her brother because of the man she married, which is exactly Dr. Kennedy&#x27;s situation as to his sister. Miss Marple at the end says she should have known all along it was Kennedy, because of the words he uttered, words that triggered Gwenda&#x27;s deeply held memory.
* There is a brief appearance in &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; of a character that appears more prominently in Christie&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot;. The character was known as Mrs. Lancaster and the story featured her characters Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. In &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, when Gwenda visits the sanatorium to find out about Kelvin Halliday, an elderly lady drinking hot milk asks her if it is her poor child, at 10:30 behind the fireplace, to which Gwenda responds negatively. While not introduced by name in &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, this elderly lady matches the description of Mrs. Lancaster from &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot;; indeed the scene from that book is nearly identical to the one described in this, save for changes in sanatorium location and character the message was delivered to.

==Literary significance and reception==
George Thaw in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; of 22 October 1976 said: &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s last novel is very good. &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; is the last of Miss Marple&#x27;s excursions into detection. But perhaps it is her best. Agatha Christie wrote it years ago but if I was going to pick a swansong book this is certainly the one that I would choose. It&#x27;s her best for years.&quot;

Gavin Lambert in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; of 19 September 1976 said: &quot;Displays Agatha Christie&#x27;s personal sense of what she calls &#x27;evil,&#x27; of murder as an affront and a violation and an act of unique cruelty... When Marple tells us here that &#x27;it was real evil that was in the air that night,&#x27; Christie makes us feel her curious primitive shiver. It is certainly the most interesting aspect of her personality and probably accounts for her extraordinary success.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;Slightly somniferous mystery, written in the &#x27;forties but published after Christie&#x27;s death. Concerns a house where murder has been committed, bought (by the merest coincidence) by someone who as a child saw the body. Sounds like Ross Macdonald, and certainly doesn&#x27;t read like vintage Christie. But why should an astute businesswoman hold back one of her better performances for posthumous publication?&quot; H. R. F. Keating included the novel in his list of &quot;100 Best Crime and Mystery Books&quot;. It was one of the bestselling books of 1976.

==Adaptations==

===Television===
;BBC adaptation
&quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; was filmed by the BBC as a 100-minute film in the sixth adaptation (of twelve) in the series &quot;Miss Marple&quot; starring Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. It was transmitted in two 50-minute parts on Sunday, 11 January and Sunday, 18 January 1987. This adaptation is fairly true to the plot of the novel.

;Japanese animated adaptation
The novel was adapted as a set of four episodes of the Japanese animated television series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Great Detectives Poirot and Marple&quot;, airing in 2005.

;ITV adaptation
A second British television adaptation, set in 1951, was transmitted on 5 February 2006 as part of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;, starring Geraldine McEwan and Sophia Myles, as Miss Marple and Gwenda, respectively. This adaptation had numerous plot changes. The most significant change is at the end it is revealed that Gwenda&#x27;s mother and stepmother were one and the same person. Claire was a jewel thief and to escape the Indian Police-Detectives, she faked her death and assumed the identity of &quot;Helen Marsden&quot;. Other changes include the deletion of some of Helen&#x27;s suitors, and the addition of a travelling company of performers called &quot;The Funnybones&quot;, which Helen was performing with at the time of her death. Dr Kennedy is made the half-brother of Kelvin&#x27;s first wife (whose name is changed from Megan to Claire). Gwenda has an absent fiancé, Charles, rather than a husband. At the end, Gwenda leaves him and becomes engaged to a member of his company, Hugh Hornbeam. Dr Kennedy does not try to kill Gwenda and does not appear to be crazy, merely that he was in love with his sister and killed her so no one could have her. Kelvin is not taken to hospital and drugged by Dr Kennedy with datura. Instead, he is murdered when Dr Kennedy pushes him over a rocky cliff.

<doc id="221484" wikidata="Q1132152" url="?curid=221484" title="Math rock">
<text>Math rock is a style of alternative and indie rock with roots in bands such as King Crimson and Rush. It is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, and extended chords. Bearing similarities to post-rock, math rock has been described as the &quot;opposite side of the same coin&quot;. Opting for a &quot;rockier&quot; approach to songwriting and timbres, the style is often performed by smaller ensembles which emphasize the role of the guitar.

Polvo, Don Caballero, Slint, Bitch Magnet, Bastro and Ruins are considered by some to be the genre&#x27;s pioneers.

== History and precursors ==

The albums &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Discipline&quot; by King Crimson, as well as &quot;Spiderland&quot; by Slint, are generally considered seminal influences on the development of math rock. The Canadian punk rock group Nomeansno (founded in 1979 and inactive as of 2016) have been cited by music critics as a &quot;secret influence&quot; on math rock, predating much of the genre&#x27;s development by more than a decade. An even more avant-garde group of the same era, Massacre, featured the guitarist Fred Frith and the bassist Bill Laswell. With some influence from the rapid-fire energy of punk, Massacre&#x27;s influential music used complex rhythmic characteristics. Black Flag&#x27;s 1984 album, &quot;My War&quot;, also included unusual polyrhythms.

Two songs on Yes&#x27; album &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971) have drawn attention – Paul Lester of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; writes that &quot;Five Per Cent for Nothing&quot; finds drummer Bill Bruford &quot;inventing math rock&quot;, while &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; was described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone and Joe Tangari as &quot;a deftly constructed proto math-rock epic&quot;.

Examples of modern math rock bands include Delta Sleep, Covet, Tricot, and TTNG.

== Characteristics ==

Math rock is typified by its rhythmic complexity, seen as &quot;mathematical&quot; in character by listeners and critics. While most rock music uses a meter (however accented or syncopated), math rock makes use of more non-standard, frequently changing time signatures such as , , , or .

As in traditional rock, the sound is most often dominated by guitars and drums. However, drums play a greater role in math rock in providing driving, complex rhythms. Math rock guitarists make use of tapping techniques and loop pedals to build on these rhythms, as illustrated by songs like those of math rock supergroup Battles.

Lyrics are generally not the focus of math rock; the voice is treated as just another instrument in the mix. Often, vocals are not overdubbed, and are positioned less prominently, as in the recording style of Steve Albini. Many of math rock&#x27;s best-known groups are entirely instrumental such as Don Caballero or Hella.

A significant intersection exists between math rock and emo, exemplified by bands such as Tiny Moving Parts or American Football, whose sound has been described as &quot;twinkly, mathy rock, a sound that became one of the defining traits of the emo scene throughout the 2000s&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term began as a joke, but has since developed into the accepted name for the musical style. One advocate of this is Matt Sweeney, singer with Chavez, a group often linked to the math rock scene. Despite this, not all critics see math rock as a serious sub-genre of rock, and some of the genre&#x27;s most notable acts have disavowed the term.
==Artists==

=== Asian ===
Math rock has a significant presence in Japan; the most prominent Japanese groups include Toe, Tricot, The Cabs, and Lite. Other Japanese groups which incorporate math rock in their music include Ling Tosite Sigure, Zazen Boys and Mouse on the Keys while the Japanoise scene features bands such as Ruins, Zeni Geva, and Boredoms.

Taiwan has a very small indie music scene, of which math rock is an emergent genre that is quickly gaining in popularity, with well-known math rock bands including Elephant Gym.

=== North American ===
Polvo of Chapel Hill, North Carolina is often considered one of the household names in math rock, although the band members themselves have disavowed the categorization.

In California, power pop groups Game Theory and the Loud Family were both led by Scott Miller, who was said to &quot;tinker with pop the way a born mathematician tinkers with numbers&quot;. The origin of Game Theory&#x27;s name is mathematical, suggesting a &quot;nearly mathy&quot; sound cited as &quot;IQ rock.&quot;

Although the Seattle grunge scene was not widely associated with math rock, some consider Soundgarden to be one of few exceptions, due to the odd time signatures found in many of their songs.

<doc id="221485" wikidata="Q852932" url="?curid=221485" title="Chaos A.D.">
<text>Chaos A.D. is the fifth studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, released in 1993 by Roadrunner Records. After the success of &quot;Arise&quot;, the band decided to expand the experimentation of that album and depart further from their earlier thrash metal sound. The album incorporates multiple genres such as groove metal and hardcore punk, and features the band&#x27;s first fully acoustic song. 

&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; is also Sepultura&#x27;s only album on Epic Records, which handled its release for North American distribution. It is also the first album to feature Paulo Jr. on bass after having played with the band in a live capacity since 1984.

The album peaked at 32 on the Billboard 200, becoming Sepultura&#x27;s highest charting record at the time and Roadrunner&#x27;s first album in the top 40. The album received widespread acclaim upon release and has come to be regarded as one of Sepultura&#x27;s best albums, and a landmark in heavy metal.

==Production==
The band considered numerous producers, including avant-garde jazz composer John Zorn and Al Jourgensen of industrial metal pioneers Ministry. They ultimately chose Andy Wallace, who had previously mixed &quot;Arise&quot;. Sepultura wanted isolation, and for that Andy Wallace suggested Rockfield Studios, located in South Wales. The recording sessions marked the first time Sepultura had recorded as a quartet as opposed to a trio, which saw Andreas Kisser handling both bass and guitar duties on their previous three albums; as such, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; was the first album to include Paulo Jr., who had been playing live with the band since joining in 1984.

&quot;Kaiowas&quot; was recorded live among the ruins of the medieval castle of Chepstow. It was an entirely acoustic track, with Kisser and Max Cavalera on the guitars and drummer Igor Cavalera and Paulo Jr. on percussion. When they recorded &quot;Kaiowas&quot;, the quartet never even considered playing the track live, because they thought it would be too difficult to recreate the drumming on stage. They changed their minds after seeing a video of the American band Neurosis: &quot;We saw in that live video that the Neurosis guys put down their guitars and everybody started to play the drums on stage&quot;, lead guitarist Andreas remembers. &quot;We decided to try the same thing. We rehearsed it once and it was wonderful. We haven&#x27;t stopped playing the song live since.&quot;

During recording sessions, Sepultura recorded several covers: &quot;The Hunt&quot;, from New Model Army, &quot;Polícia&quot;, from Titãs, &quot;Inhuman Nature&quot;, from the American hardcore punk band Final Conflict, and &quot;Crucificados pelo Sistema&quot;, from Brazilian Ratos de Porão. Igor, a New Model Army fan, convinced the other band members to include &quot;The Hunt&quot; on the record. Paulo joked that the money of the LP would go straight to new dentures for Justin Sullivan, the toothless singer of New Model Army. The latter 3 covers would be included as B-sides and also on the compilation &quot;Blood-Rooted&quot;. &quot;Polícia&quot; is also included as a bonus track on the Brazilian edition of the album. Up until the time the album was due, the title was originally Propaganda after track 6, but Max Cavalera changed it to &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; after the Misfits&#x27; &quot;Earth A.D.&quot;

==Musical style==
Out of the boredom of playing the &quot;Arise&quot; songs for two years straight and concerned about the threat of musically stagnating, Sepultura pushed the envelope on &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; The new material came out slower, with more emphasis on groove than speed. The first track, &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot;, revealed the band&#x27;s new direction. The song starts with the heartbeat of Max&#x27;s then-unborn first son, Zyon, followed by some Afro-Brazilian drumming reminiscent of Salvador, Bahia samba-reggae group Olodum. About the track&#x27;s introductory guitar riff, Max said it &quot;could have been created by a death metal band.&quot;

According to Max Cavalera, &quot;diversity was the key to &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;&quot;, also saying &quot;Biotech Is Godzilla&quot; was &quot;pure hardcore&quot;. &quot;Nomad&quot;, with its characteristically slow riffs, was described by lead guitarist Andreas Kisser as their answer to Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Sad but True&quot;. The album also featured Sepultura&#x27;s first all-acoustic incursion, &quot;Kaiowas&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s like a mixture of Led Zeppelin, Sonic Youth and Olodum&quot;, said Max of that particular song.

&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; was their first record to use some lower guitar tunings. Half of the songs in the album are tuned down to D standard, except for &quot;Kaiowas&quot;, which is in drop C tuning. Max Cavalera said he &quot;had to fight Andreas over&quot; retuning the guitars to D, partly because all of Sepultura&#x27;s songs, until then, were written in standard tuning. He argued that Black Sabbath also played in D, and they could do the same.

==Themes==
After traveling extensively abroad for their &quot;Arise&quot; tour, the band came to see their home-country in a new light. Brazil&#x27;s political issues and music then came to the fore. Sepultura targeted and denounced racism, discrimination, xenophobia and neocolonialism, and how they fueled destructive policies and power-hungry politicians. Writing for &quot;VICE&quot;, author J.J. Anselmi declared that the &quot;social messages of &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; are timeless and universal, making it one of the most important metal albums ever recorded.&quot;

The lyrics of &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot; mention &quot;tanks on the streets, confronting police, bleeding the plebs.&quot; Its chorus (&quot;Refuse! Resist!&quot;) resembles a protest march slogan, and when released as a single featured a photograph of a South Korean student rushing at Seoul&#x27;s riot police contingent while holding a Molotov cocktail. Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Max Cavalera remembered: &quot;This certainly got in touch with the dark side of Sepultura. &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot; is an anti-police song – a real piece of anarchy. You could call the album riot music. It was full of heavy shit and some of it was risky, but it was just where we were coming from at the time.&quot; The next song, &quot;Territory&quot;, dealt with the conflict between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. &quot;Slave New World&quot; — with its lyrics co-written by Biohazard bassist Evan Seinfeld — was a protest against censorship.

Massacres were a major part of &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;″s overall theme. &quot;Amen&quot; tackled the massacre of David Koresh&#x27;s followers in Waco, Texas. &quot;Manifest&quot; had a faux-radio report of the Carandiru massacre, and &quot;Kaiowas&quot; was made in honor of a Brazilian Indian tribe that committed collective suicide in protest against the government that wanted to drive them off the land of their ancestors. &quot;Nomad&quot;, written by Andreas, talked about people expelled from their homelands.

On &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, Sepultura honored one of their biggest idols, Jello Biafra. Max had called Biafra asking him to contribute to the album with a song about the growing neo-Nazi movement. &quot;I asked for something like &#x27;Nazi Punks Fuck Off - Part 2&#x27;&quot;, remembers Max, referring to the anti-Nazi song &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off&quot; by the Dead Kennedys. But Biafra wasn&#x27;t interested in recycling old ideas, and suggested a song called &quot;Biotech Is Godzilla&quot;, that he had written during his visit to Eco &#x27;92, a world conference about ecology organized in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;Jello spent ten minutes explaining me his crazy theories&quot;, said Max to Anamaria G. of &quot;Bizz&quot; magazine, &quot;he said that George Bush had sent a group of scientists to Brazil to test germs and bacteria on human beings and use them as guinea pigs. The lyrics claim that biotechnology created AIDS. But they don&#x27;t say that technology is bad, just that it&#x27;s in the wrong hands.&quot;

==Touring and promotion==
By the time &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; arrived, Sepultura were the biggest act of Roadrunner&#x27;s roster. Aware of the band&#x27;s increasing popularity, the label spent nearly $1 million on a &quot;marketing blitz&quot; which quickly guaranteed them silver and gold records in Belgium, France and the UK. The group also signed an exclusive distribution deal with a major label, Epic Records, home of Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. This deal eventually went sour: Epic paid little attention to Sepultura, preferring to invest in Fight and Prong.

The &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; tour launched on October 23, 1993, with gothic metal band Paradise Lost as the opening act. The tour went well, except for an incident where Berlin&#x27;s police received a false tip claiming that Sepultura&#x27;s tour bus was loaded with a major cocaine shipment. Enraged by the unjust search and seizure procedure, Max re-wrote &quot;Antichrist&quot;, from their 1985 &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot; EP, as &quot;Anti-Cop&quot;, and then the band proceeded in playing the song live throughout the tour (a recorded version is available on the combined re-release of &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot;/&quot;Morbid Visions&quot; and &quot;The Roots of Sepultura&quot; albums). While touring Europe, rumors floated around that Sepultura would be part of the latest edition of Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Rock&quot; music festival, taking place in January 1994. The event would happen simultaneously on São Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. The North American leg, which was co-headlined by Pantera, coincided with the 1994 FIFA World Cup, with the concert in Irvine, California, taking place on July 17, a few hours after the tournament final, in nearby Pasadena. Sepultura, whose members attended the match, took to the stage decorated in the Brazilian colors in celebration of the national team&#x27;s triumph in the tournament.

In October 1994, the Black Sabbath tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black&quot; was released. It was the brainchild of producer Bob Chiappardi, a project two years in the making. &quot;Nativity in Black&quot; featured mostly &quot;up-and-coming&quot; bands such as White Zombie, Biohazard, Type O Negative and Therapy?. Sepultura&#x27;s contribution was their &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; cover, a song they played live since the &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; (1989) tour. According to the band, the invitation came due to their good relations with Concrete, Chiappardi&#x27;s production company. In November, Sepultura did a brief Brazilian tour with The Ramones. Fellow countrymen Viper and Raimundos were the opening acts. The tour spanned five dates, with shows in Curitiba, Florianópolis, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Santo André. The joint tour came about as happenstance: both bands wanted to tour in Brazil in the same time period.

==&quot;Third World Chaos&quot;==

Sepultura&#x27;s second home video, &quot;Third World Chaos&quot;, was released in VHS format in June 27, 1995. It features interviews, music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and portions of concerts and jam sessions from the &quot;Chaos AD&quot; tour. The video starts with a live (and sped-up) rendition of their Motörhead cover &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; from their 1994 Monsters of Rock show, at Donington Park, UK. It segues to a series of press clippings with Roy Mayorga&#x27;s &quot;Chaos BC&quot; remix serving as background music. The &quot;Slave New World&quot; promotional video comes next, with a brief making of scene and Max explaining to a Japanese interviewer the song&#x27;s theme. This leads to Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson interviewing both Max and Andreas, and they clarify the concept behind &quot;Kaiowas&quot; title and how it was recorded. The band plays the song live on MTV Europe and on their Monsters of Rock gig. More backstage antics are shown, now with tourmates Biohazard together in a percussive jam. The promos for &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot; and &quot;Territory&quot; are next.

There&#x27;s also older archival footage on &quot;Third World Chaos&quot;. One example is the &quot;Arise&quot; video, whose location shooting was California&#x27;s Death Valley, where the infamous Manson Family resided for a time in the late 1960s. There&#x27;s also their first ever promo —&quot;Inner Self&quot;—a track taken from their &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, with many commending the album&#x27;s experimentation and sense of the band coming into their own. AllMusic declared it one of the best heavy metal albums of all time, calling it &quot;a remarkable achievement not only in its concentrated power and originality, but also in the degree to which Sepultura eclipsed their idols in offering a vision of heavy metal&#x27;s future.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; proclaimed that &quot;Sepultura will separate casual headbangers from rabid addicts fast... even non-metalheads will be impressed by the variety in [&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;]: they&#x27;re not averse to slowing things down.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==

&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; was a watershed moment for the band. The quartet faced many challenges with the record. For one, they made a risqué transition from their earlier death/thrash sound. Sepultura also traversed the radical shift in the rock music scene of the 1990s, with the sudden popularity of alternative rock. &quot;We made a record that was very metal&quot;, said Max Cavalera; there &quot;was an explosion of grunge and nobody wanted anything to do with metal.&quot; Despite everything, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; was ultimately a triumph. &quot;It was a magical and very inspiring time&quot; remembers the elder Cavalera.

&quot;Sound of the Beast&quot; author Ian Christe credits &quot;Chaos A.D&quot;, along with Pantera, for developing the groove metal style, which would later influence other artists in the &#x27;90s. It is one of Joe Duplantier&#x27;s top ten albums, guitarist-songwriter for Gojira. In his opinion, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; &quot;gave birth to the whole nu-metal scene.&quot; Korn were inspired by the album when they started out. At least two members from Slipknot attested how &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; was important to them.

&quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; was ranked 29th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s and 63th on &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s 100 greatest metal albums lists. &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, charted at number 26 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;40 Greatest Metal Songs&quot; list. In &quot;Rolling Stone Brasil&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest MPB records, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; held the 46th position. According to the magazine, the album was a &quot;point of inflection&quot; for the band and the heavy metal scene. It paved the way to &quot;another essential record&quot;—&quot;Roots&quot;—ranked No. 57 in the same list.
===Impact===

Sepultura&#x27;s newfound interest in the music and socials ills of Brazil inspired—or ran parallel to—their fellow countrymen&#x27;s own MPB/metal experiments. One particular case was Overdose, Sepultura&#x27;s former Cogumelo labelmates. Overdose&#x27;s 5th album, &quot;Progress of Decadence&quot; (1993), opened with &quot;Rio, Samba e Porrada na Morro&quot;, an industrial-meets-samba intro five years in the making. The rest of the album segues into their own brand of groove metal. Furthermore, Overdose inserted political themes in their lyrics, although they had been doing such before Sepultura.

Saravá metal group Gangrena Gasosa&#x27;s debut &quot;Welcome to Terreiro&quot; (1993) opens with &quot;Troops of Olodum&quot;, a spoof on Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Troops of Doom&quot; complete with the song&#x27;s intro riff and Olodum-styled percussion.

On Brazilian band Angra&#x27;s concept album, &quot;Holy Land&quot;, lead guitar player Kiko Loureiro said that, when composing for their second album, the MPB influence &quot;came naturally&quot;. Despite this statement there was, indeed, a concerted effort by the group to explore their Brazilian musical identity. It was partly a response to the criticism directed towards &quot;Angels Cry&quot; (1994), which drew many comparisons to Helloween, Iron Maiden and others. &quot;Holy Land&quot; and Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; were released a month apart from each other, and they both highlighted a major moment for Brazil&#x27;s metal scene.

Although it became a popular trend in the 1990s, the mixing of metal and percussion remains a controversial topic in the Brazilian scene. One example is the &quot;tribal&quot; thrash metal of Krucipha, which takes inspiration from Pernambuco&#x27;s maracatu through the states&#x27; manguebeat movement. The band&#x27;s music still divides opinions, enraging metal purists.

<text>Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (, , &quot;Tie Me!&quot;) is a 1989 Spanish black romantic comedy film co-written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, starring Victoria Abril and Antonio Banderas alongside Loles León, Francisco Rabal, Julieta Serrano, María Barranco, and Rossy de Palma. The plot follows a recently released psychiatric patient who kidnaps an actress in order to make her fall in love with him. He believes his destiny is to marry her and father her children.

The film was highly successful with both critics and audiences in Spain. Its United States release was entangled in controversy, instrumental in the implementation by the MPAA of a new rating category, NC-17, for films of an explicit nature that were previously categorized as pornographic due to the X rating.

==Plot==
Ricky, a 23-year-old psychiatric patient, has been deemed cured and is released from a psych hospital. Until then, he has been the lover of the hospital&#x27;s female director. An orphan, free, and alone, his goal is to have a normal life with actress Marina Osorio, a former porn star and recovering drug addict, whom he once slept with during an escape from the asylum.

At a studio, Marina is filming &quot;The Midnight Phantom&quot;, a Euro-horror film about a mutilated, masked muscleman in love with her character. The film is directed by Máximo Espejo, an old director confined to a wheelchair after a stroke. Máximo is a mentor to Marina, and threatens to throw out a journalist who mentions the words &quot;porn&quot; and &quot;junkie&quot; in her presence. Máximo is secretly attracted to Marina and plans to enjoy what could be his last experience of directing a female lead.

When Ricky comes to the set, he steals some items, including the keys to Marina&#x27;s apartment, and becomes an unwelcome presence in her life. Ricky, while wearing a wig, does a handstand to try to capture her attention, but Marina does not remember him and dismisses him.

After filming the last scene, Marina prepares to change for the post-shoot party. Ricky follows her to her apartment. When she answers the door, Ricky forces his way in. He grabs her and headbutts Marina to silence her when she screams; he tapes her mouth and binds her with rope. Marina wakes up with a toothache which normal painkillers do not relieve, as she is addicted to stronger drugs. Ricky says that he captured her, so that when she gets to know him better, she will fall in love and they will get married and have children. Marina declares she will never love him, enraged at being handcuffed, gagged and lashed to the bed. However, Ricky remains determined to win her heart.

Marina is shocked and in pain, and persuades Ricky to take her to a doctor who can give her the necessary painkillers. When Ricky leaves her alone with the doctor, she cannot communicate her plight. They cannot obtain the drugs in the pharmacy, so Ricky tries to buy them on the black market. However, rather than paying the street price, he attacks the dealer to steal the tablets.

During the wrap party, Marina&#x27;s sister Lola, who is the film&#x27;s assistant director, steals the show with a musical number. Worried about her sister&#x27;s disappearance, Lola visits Marina&#x27;s apartment and leaves a note. To avoid being discovered, Ricky moves Marina to her next door neighbor&#x27;s apartment, which is empty, but the owner left his keys with Lola so she can water his plants while he is away during the summer.

In the street again, Ricky is spotted by the dealer whom he attacked. Ricky is then beaten, robbed and left unconscious. During his absence, Marina tries to escape from her captivity. However, when Ricky returns covered with blood and cuts, she notices his vulnerability and devotion to her. She cares for him, cleaning and sterilizing his wounds, and is struck by the realization that she has fallen in love with her captor. They eventually have sex and decide to visit Ricky&#x27;s hometown.

When he is about to leave to steal a car for the trip, Marina, who still considers herself his prisoner, tells him to keep her tied up so that she will not try to escape. However, in Ricky&#x27;s absence, Lola re-enters the apartment and discovers Marina tied up and rescues her. Marina informs Lola that she is in love with her captor. Lola is astonished, but once convinced, she agrees to drive Marina to Ricky&#x27;s hometown. They find him in the ruins of his family house in a deserted village, then the three climb into Lola&#x27;s car to return to the city. When Lola accepts Ricky as a member of the family, saying that she will find Ricky a job within the week, Marina begins to cry, and they drive off together, singing &quot;Resistiré&quot; (&quot;I will prevail&quot;) in unison.

===Casting===
&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; marked Almodóvar&#x27;s breaking-up with his longtime star, Carmen Maura, in a rift that took many years to heal. In any case, at the age of 44, Maura was too old to play the protagonist, a role that demanded a younger actress. The film was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration with Victoria Abril, whom Almodóvar had previously considered for the role of Cristal, the prostitute neighbor in &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; (1984), and Candela, the model fleeing a relationship with a terrorist in &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; (1988). Abril had a cameo role in &quot;Law of Desire&quot;, and was already a well-established actress, identified with strong female characters.

The male lead was played by Banderas, in his fifth and most important collaboration with Almodóvar. His role in &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; launched his career in American films. Loles Léon, a stand-up comedian, plays Marina&#x27;s sassy sister Lola. She had previously appeared as the meddlesome telephonist in &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot;. Francisco Rabal, one of Spain&#x27;s foremost actors, took the role of the film director. Almodóvar cast his own mother, Francisca Caballero, as Marina&#x27;s mother. Rossy de Palma, the actress of Picassoesque appearance discovered by Almodóvar in 1986, plays the small role of the drug dealer.

===Analysis===
The Spanish title &quot;¡Átame!&quot; literally means &quot;Tie Me Up!&quot;, while the second part of the English title, &quot;Tie Me Down!&quot;, is presumably intended to suggest the idea of a lasting relationship. Almodóvar has consistently denied that the ropes within &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; have any links with sadomasochism. There is no erotic charge to the ropes and gags. He explained: 

Ricky&#x27;s stated ambition is to be a good husband to Marina and a good father to their children. Indeed, the relationship between Marina and Ricky is meant, ultimately, to be a parody of how such relationships work, as if heterosexuality (and its consequence, marriage) are almost inevitably equivalent in character to the infamous Stockholm syndrome. The cords that tie us one to another become literal ropey metaphors in the film. It is a tale not of kinky sex, but of a sweeter human bondage, of loose ends tied into lover&#x27;s knots.

&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; follows in the myth of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and the notion that the savagery of the Beast is, in the presence of Beauty, tamed by gentler feelings. This has been a recurrent theme in films such as &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932) and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931). This theme is also present in Spanish Literature. In the play &quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;, by Calderon de la Barca, the main character is Segismundo, a half-man, half-beast who has been imprisoned for his whole twenty years; once released into the world, he finds that his violence is tamed by female beauty.

The abduction narrative of &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; has some similarities with the film &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965), directed by William Wyler, in which a butterfly specialist abducts a young woman in order to add her to his collection. &quot;The Collector&quot; was adapted from the eponymous novel by John Fowles. In style, theme and plot details, however, &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; differs greatly from Wyler&#x27;s film and the novel that inspired it. Bride kidnapping is also a central plot device in the Hollywood musical &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954).

===Genre===
&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; combines two different film genres: romantic comedy and horror film. In spite of some dark elements, it can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director&#x27;s clearest love story. Almodóvar described the film as a &quot;romantic fairy tale&quot;. Ricky, in his violent courtship of Marina follows, in an exaggerated manner, the path of the romantic film genre like those made popular in the late 1950s by Doris Day with various male film stars: &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959) with Rock Hudson, &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot; (1963) with James Garner, and &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962) with Cary Grant.

&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; is also rooted on the tradition of the horror film genre. Marina plays the lead in the horror film &quot;The Midnight Phantom&quot;, in which she defeats the Phantom&#x27;s attempt to kill her, overcoming him and thus subverting the horror film tradition of a woman as victim, in a way that parallels Marina&#x27;s relationship with Ricky. While filming &quot;The Midnight Phantom&quot;, Lola notes that the film they are working on is &#x27;more a love story than a horror story&#x27;, to which Maximo the director replies, &quot;sometimes they&#x27;re indistinguishable&quot;. &quot;The Midnight Phantom&quot; is not simply a film within the film: just as the girl in &quot;The Midnight Phantom&quot; defeats the monster, so ultimately Marina will succeed in taming Ricky. In a way, &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; is an extension of &quot;The Midnight Phantom&quot; and both films mix variant versions of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; that are within the genres of horror and romance. &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; also makes reference to two horror films: &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956) and &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968). Máximo has a poster of the former in his editing room, and Marina watches the latter while Ricky is away.

===Music===
The soundtrack was composed by Ennio Morricone in the style of a thriller, and is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). Almodóvar admired Morricone&#x27;s soundtracks for westerns, but found the music for &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; conventional and uninspiring, too similar to Morricone&#x27;s work for the film &quot;Frantic&quot;, and used only half of Morricone&#x27;s music.

&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down&quot;! prominently features two songs. The film closes with the theme &quot;Resistiré&quot; (&quot;I Will Resist&quot;) by Dúo Dinámico, a Spanish pop duo from the 1960s, suggesting Marina&#x27;s happy resistance to Ricky&#x27;s unconventional courtship. The wrap party scene breaks the hardship of the kidnapping scene. It presents Marina&#x27;s sister Lola, played by Loles León, singing the bolero &quot;Canción del Alma&quot;, a song popularized in Latin America by Alfredo Sadel.

==Reception==
&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot;, Almodóvar&#x27;s eighth film, was completed in late 1989. Its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in early 1990, was inauspicious. The projector broke down and in the following press conference Almodóvar, whose films have not been well understood in Germany, was subjected to heavy questioning about his homosexuality, drug abuse, and the Spanishness of his film.

Released in Spain in January 1990, &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; was an enormous success, becoming the highest-grossing domestic film of its year, reaching an audience of over a million. It had twice the audience of the most critically acclaimed Spanish film of that year, Carlos Saura&#x27;s &quot;¡Ay Carmela!&quot;, a film starring Almodóvar&#x27;s former muse Carmen Maura.

The film was generally well received by Spanish critics. Lluis Bonet, writing in &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, called the film &quot;a terrible tender love story&quot;, agreeing with the director that the best scene was that in which Marina, initially held hostage by Ricky against her will, finally asks to be tied up by him so she will not be tempted to flee from the love he has successfully provoked in her. Critic Javier Maqua in &quot;Cinco Días&quot; called Marina&#x27;s request evidence of &quot;the greatest intensity of love&quot;. Rossy de Palma, who plays a drug dealer in the film, explained that the film&#x27;s kidnapping was not to be imitated in real life and was only justified by the &quot;exceptional nature of the characters&quot;.

British critics took time to warm to Almodóvar&#x27;s films and dismissed &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot;. Lawrence O&#x27;Toole of &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; described it as &quot;fairly banal, schematic and essentially humorless&quot;.

In the United States, the film was met with opposition from rating agencies and the public due to a lengthy sex scene and two sequences in which Marina and later her sister Lola sit on the toilet to urinate. Particularly controversial was the shot of Marina in a bath tub, pleasuring herself with a scuba diver toy. &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; was entangled in a rating classification battle and was the subject of heated debate. Eventually released unrated, the film was decried by feminists and women&#x27;s advocacy groups for its sadomasochist overtones and portrayal of successful female abduction and abuse. Modern audiences have criticized Almodóvar for &quot;... condon[ing] Ricky&#x27;s behavior, suggesting that it&#x27;s okay to brutalize and subjugate a woman so long as one is allegedly motivated by sincere passion&quot;. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 32 reviews, with an average score of 6.20/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; undermines its own effectiveness with an excess of camp, but writer-director Pedro Almodóvar and an attractive cast make it all worth watching.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 55% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; grossed $4,087,361 at the North American box office.

==Controversy==
There was a legal battle over the decision by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which determines film ratings in the United States, to give &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; an X rating, which, by that point, had become heavily associated with pornography. This marginalized its distribution and reduced its chance of box-office success. Miramax, the film&#x27;s distribution company in North America, filed a lawsuit against the MPAA over the X rating. When the case came to court in New York, it gave rise to a general debate on cinema, censorship, and sexuality in the United States.

The attorney for Miramax claimed that the AAP (Average American Parent) was not well served by a system that was lenient on films with hard violence and drug use, while being harsh with films depicting sex. Miramax lost its case in court, and the film was ultimately released unrated. However, numerous other filmmakers had complained about the X rating given to their films, and in September 1990, the MPAA dropped the X rating and replaced it with the NC-17 rating, with &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot; as the first film released with the new rating. This was especially helpful to films of an explicit nature that were previously assumed to be pornographic because of the X rating. &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; itself would eventually be given that rating for a &quot;scene of strong adult sensuality with nudity.&quot;

==Home video==
&quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD in Spanish with English subtitles. It includes the film&#x27;s trailer, but there are no other extras. The Region 2 DVD, released in the UK, includes an interview of Almodóvar by Banderas, footage of the premiere in Madrid, poster and still galleries, and trailers.

On 19 August 2014, the film was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection in the United States. A new documentary produced by Criterion was included among the extras, including some that were ported over from previous releases.

<doc id="221501" wikidata="Q178642" url="?curid=221501" title="Soulfly">
<text>Soulfly is an American heavy metal band formed in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997. Soulfly is led by former Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera, who formed the band after he left the Brazilian group in 1996. To date the band has released twelve studio albums, one tour EP, twenty-three singles, one video album, and twelve music videos. Their debut album, &quot;Soulfly&quot;, was released on April 21, 1998, while their most recent album, &quot;Totem&quot;, was released on August 5, 2022.

Soulfly incorporates many styles of metal with Brazilian tribal and world music, much like Cavalera&#x27;s previous band Sepultura. The original lyrical content revolved around spirituality, political and religious themes, with later albums encompassing other themes including war, violence, aggression, slavery, hatred and anger. All of their first six studio albums debuted on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with a peak position at number 32 for their second album, &quot;Primitive&quot;. &quot;Soulfly&quot; has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==History==
===Formation, self-titled album, and &quot;Primitive&quot; (1997–2001)===
Soulfly was formed in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997. Max Cavalera was troubled during the recording of Soulfly&#x27;s self-titled album, and on the band&#x27;s website he said that he founded the band &quot;with the idea of combined sounds and spiritual beliefs&quot;. As well as leaving Sepultura, one of the world&#x27;s most renowned thrash/groove metal bands, he had to deal with the death of his stepson and best friend Dana Wells. The self-titled debut album was released in April 1998, and reached number 79 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The name &quot;Soulfly&quot; came about during the recordings of &quot;Headup&quot; with Deftones, which Cavalera said it invokes &quot;a tribal belief.&quot;

In addition to the core band, which at the time consisted of Roy Mayorga on drums and percussion, Cello Dias on bass and Lúcio &quot;Jackson Bandeira&quot; Maia on lead guitar, &quot;Soulfly&quot; featured Burton C. Bell, Dino Cazares and Christian Olde Wolbers from Fear Factory, Fred Durst and DJ Lethal from Limp Bizkit, Chino Moreno from Deftones, Benji Webbe formerly of Welsh band Dub War and now a member of Skindred, Eric Bobo from Cypress Hill, Jorge do Peixe and Gilmar Bola Oito from Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi, and Mario C. The album was recorded at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California, and was overseen by producer Ross Robinson.

In addition to fronting Soulfly, Cavalera also branched out into other areas not usually associated with heavy metal musicians. He became a speaker at music conventions, appearing at CMJ&#x27;s New Music Marathon in New York and Holland&#x27;s Crossing Border Festival, both in late 1997, and sang a TV commercial for Sprite in Brazil. After recording the first album, Jackson Bandeira returned to Brazil with Nação Zumbi and was replaced by Logan Mader of Machine Head for the live tour that followed. Soulfly played on the 1998 Ozzfest mainstage alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth, and Tool, and played small club tours around the world with bands such as System of a Down and Cold. After the world tour in support of &quot;Soulfly&quot;, Logan Mader was replaced by Mikey Doling who had just been displaced by the breakup of Snot.

A variety of influences, including nu metal, appeared on 2000s &quot;Primitive&quot;, and it was the most successful album by the band in the U.S., reaching number 32 on the Billboard 200 and number 11 on the independent charts. Joe Nuñez, from Chicago, replaced Roy Mayorga on drums for &quot;Primitive&quot;. The album featured a number of guest appearances as well, including Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Sean Lennon, Chino Moreno of Deftones, Tom Araya of Slayer, Grady Avenell of Will Haven, Cutthroat Logic, Babatunde and Asha Rabouin and was produced by Toby Wright. In addition, artwork was created by longtime Bob Marley artist Neville Garrick. The release of the album was followed by world tours with the likes of Pantera, Morbid Angel and Ozzfest.

=== &quot;3&quot;, new line-up and &quot;Prophecy&quot; (2002–2004) ===
In late 2001, Joe Nunez left Soulfly to join Stripping the Pistol, saying that it was &quot;time for [him] to move on&quot;. Roy Mayorga departed from his band Medication to rejoin Soulfly for the recording of their third album, &quot;3.&quot; &quot;3&quot; was the first Soulfly album which was produced by Max Cavalera. Other musicians performing on &quot;3&quot; included Cristian Machado of Ill Niño, and guitarist Wiley Arnet and drummer Greg Hall of Sacred Reich, and Max&#x27;s stepson Richie Cavalera. The album reached number 46 on the Billboard 200 in that year. After the release of &quot;3&quot; on June 25, 2002, Soulfly toured throughout Europe and North America with bands such as Slayer, In Flames, God Forbid, and Will Haven.

In September 2003, after the world tour for &quot;3&quot;, Dias was fired from the band, and Mayorga and Doling both left the band in protest, leaving Cavalera as the sole remaining member for three weeks.

Cavalera recruited a new lineup in October 2003 for the recording of Soulfly&#x27;s &quot;Prophecy&quot; album. Joe Nunez returned on drums with Kentucky native Bobby Burns, formerly of Primer 55, on bass and New Jersey native Marc Rizzo, formerly of Ill Niño, on lead guitar. David Ellefson, formerly of Megadeth at the time, also played bass on several of the album&#x27;s songs.

Max Cavalera explained on the band&#x27;s website that he wanted to use different musicians as part of the group for each album. &quot;This is an approach that I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a while. I never wanted Soulfly to be a band like Metallica, with the same four guys. On every Soulfly album, we&#x27;ve changed the line up and it will probably continue that way. In order to do that, I had to start from the inside out and bring in people who caught my attention, that I had never played with before, and create this.&quot; While a member of Sepultura, Cavalera had shown an interest in world music as shown in &quot;Roots&quot;, featuring elements of the music of Brazil&#x27;s indigenous peoples. This approach continued on the &quot;Prophecy&quot; album, with Cavalera traveling to Serbia to record with traditional musicians. On the song &quot;Moses&quot;, he worked with Serbian band Eyesburn, which also features reggae influences from one of his heroes, Bob Marley. Other tracks on the album feature instruments from the Middle Ages, sheepskin bagpipes, and Serbian Gypsies. Danny Marianino and Asha Rabouin returned as guest vocalists on &quot;Prophecy&quot;, as well, and Max Cavalera produced the album. &quot;Prophecy&quot; was released on March 30, 2004, and in April of that year had reached a peak of number 82 on the Billboard 200, although it has reached the top 50 of the Australian album charts. Soulfly followed the album release with tours supporting Black Sabbath and Morbid Angel.

In February 2005, Soulfly released their first DVD, entitled &quot;The Song Remains Insane&quot;. This was a biography of the band, containing live footage from all over the globe, interviews, and all of the band&#x27;s music videos. In August 2005, Roadrunner Records reissued their self-titled first album as part of the label&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration.

=== &quot;Dark Ages&quot; (2005–2007) ===
In December 2004, as recording was beginning for Soulfly&#x27;s fifth studio album, the band was rocked by several tragedies that affected the outcome of the album. On December 8, Cavalera&#x27;s friend &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott was shot and killed while playing in Ohio, and on December 10, Cavalera&#x27;s eight-month-old grandson Moses unexpectedly died due to health complications. The following fall, on October 4, 2005, &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was released. Many critics have described &quot;Dark Ages&quot; as a return to Cavalera&#x27;s thrash metal roots of the early Sepultura days; however, the world music influence found on the first four Soulfly albums is still present. In fact, this time, Cavalera traveled to five different countries — Serbia, Turkey, Russia, France, and the United States — in order to record all the sounds that he desired to have on the new album.

The core band on &quot;Dark Ages&quot; still consisted of Cavalera, Joe Nunez, Bobby Burns and Marc Rizzo, and on this album, Dave Ellefson came back to lend his talents to a couple of tracks, Eyesburn vocalist Coyote sang on &quot;Innerspirit&quot;, Stormtroopers of Death vocalist Billy Milano and Russian singer Paul Fillipenko of FAQ screamed on the hardcore influenced &quot;Molotov&quot;, and Max&#x27;s stepson, Ritchie Cavalera from Phoenix-based band Incite, sang on &quot;Staystrong&quot;. Soulfly supported &quot;Dark Ages&quot; on a world tour with various bands such as Deftones, Korn, Throwdown, and Skindred that has stretched through North America, South America, Europe, Russia, and Australia.

On August 17, 2006, Soulfly played the 10th Annual D-Low Memorial show with several guest artists including Dave Ellefson and Roy Mayorga, the latter of whom who currently plays with Stone Sour. Most notably, Max was reunited onstage for the first time in 10 years with his brother Igor Cavalera. Max and Igor formed Sepultura together in the early 1980s, but had not played together since Max&#x27;s departure in 1997. Igor joined the band midway through the set for a jam on the drums and stayed onstage to play the Sepultura classics &quot;Roots Bloody Roots&quot; and &quot;Attitude&quot; on Joe Nunez&#x27;s drum kit.

In the time between legs of Soulfly&#x27;s world tour for &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and afterwards, members of Soulfly stayed extremely busy by focusing on projects and activities outside of the band. Cavalera guested on the Apocalyptica single &quot;Repressed&quot; with Bullet For My Valentine vocalist Matt Tuck during a visit to Germany, went to Russia in January 2007 to guest on the album &quot;Circus Dogs&quot; by Russian hardcore band FAQ and played on Saint-Petersbourg with Radiohead album sound producer Nike &quot;Naik&quot; Groshin, played a surprise jam session in Serbia with Dan Lilker of Brutal Truth and S.O.D., and spent time in Arizona writing for future releases. Marc Rizzo spent the year on the road throughout North America playing his solo flamenco-meets-shred metal, gaining him further recognition as one of the world&#x27;s premier metal guitarists. Earlier in 2005, Rizzo had released his debut solo album, &quot;Colossal Myopia&quot;, through Shrapnel Records, and in 2007 he prepared his follow-up, &quot;The Ultimate Devotion&quot;, which has now been released. Burns purchased a studio in Orlando, Florida with his partner Tim Lau, revived his former band Primer 55, and worked on new releases for his Love Said No and King Street projects. In September 2006, Burns suffered a mild stroke, was forced to sit out of Soulfly&#x27;s North American tour, and his spot in the band was briefly filled by Dave Ellefson and Danny Lilker. Nunez worked on the development of several drum accessories with Slug Drums, and taught drum lessons and worked construction in Chicago. Soulfly ventured to Undercity Recording Studios in March 2007 to record a cover of the Marilyn Manson single &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; with Logan Mader producing. The song was later released in June 2007 by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine in issue 1164 as part of their &quot;Higher Voltage&quot; compilation. During time in the studio, Max Cavalera also recorded vocals for the song &quot;War Is My Destiny&quot; with Ill Bill and Immortal Technique for Ill Bill&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Hour of Reprisal&quot;, which released on September 16, 2008.

=== &quot;Conquer&quot; and &quot;Omen&quot; (2008–2010) ===

In August 2007, Soulfly did a tour that consisted of a mixture of festival and club shows through Europe before playing the 11th Annual D-Low Memorial Show in Tempe, Arizona on August 31, 2007. Cavalera Conspiracy also made their debut live performance at the show by opening for Soulfly. One week after performing the show, Soulfly went to Bobby Burns and Tim Lau&#x27;s newly renovated Porch Studio in Orlando, Florida to begin work on their sixth studio album, which Cavalera had begun writing during the summer. After working halfway through recording until September 29, Cavalera halted the session to travel throughout Egypt to record more sounds to integrate into the new songs. In November 2007, Cavalera returned to Orlando to complete tracking and the album was mixed by Andy Sneap in early 2008. The album featured collaborations Dave Peters from Throwdown and David Vincent from Morbid Angel.

Soulfly released their sixth album entitled &quot;Conquer&quot; on July 29, 2008. Following the release of the album, the band toured the United States with Devastation and Bleed the Sky in the fall, toured Europe in winter of 2009 with Incite, played a small UK and European festivals during the spring and summer of 2009, and went on a fall 2009 U.S. headlining tour with Cattle Decapitation, Prong, and Mutiny Within.

Soulfly entered the Edge of the Earth Studios in Los Angeles, California, on November 6, 2009, to begin recording their seventh album with Max Cavalera and Logan Mader both producing. Through a series of streaming web video updates, frontman Max Cavalera revealed on November 13, 2009, that the album would be called &quot;Omen&quot; and would feature guest appearances by Tommy Victor of Prong and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. Additionally, the album features performances on drums from Max&#x27;s sons: Zyon Cavalera on a b-side cover of Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Refuse-Resist&quot; and Igor Cavalera (not to be confused with his brother of the same name) on a cover of Excel&#x27;s &quot;Your Life, My Life&quot;. &quot;Omen&quot; has been released worldwide on May 25, 2010.

From May 13 – December 16, 2010, Soulfly conducted a world tour in support of their new album &quot;Omen&quot;.

On July 18, 2010, bassist Bobby Burns posted following message on his Twitter profile: &quot;To all the fans... Soulfly and I have decided to part ways. Stay tuned for my next projects already in the works. Thanks 4 ur support!!!&quot;

=== Line up change, &quot;Enslaved&quot; and &quot;Savages&quot; (2011–2013) ===
On July 1, 2011, Soulfly announced that the group had recruited former Static-X and current Asesino, and then Prong, and Ministry bassist Tony Campos into the band, replacing Bobby Burns.

In August 2011, Joe Nunez was replaced by Borknagar drummer David Kinkade. In September 2011, the band announced they entered the recording studio to make their next album due for an early 2012 release. In late October it was revealed that recording had finished, and Kinkade claimed that the new album is like &quot;&quot;Arise&quot; on crack&quot;. Confirmed guests on the album were Adam Warren of Oceano and Dez Fafara of Coal Chamber and DevilDriver, although Warren pulled out of recording and was replaced by Cattle Decapitation frontman Travis Ryan. In the December 2011 issue of Metal Hammer, Cavalera stated that the main theme of the album would be slavery, with song titles &quot;Slave&quot;, &quot;Chains&quot;, &quot;Legions&quot; (a song about the Roman Empire), &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Redemption of Man by God&quot; (featuring Dez Fafara), and &quot;Revengeance&quot; (with Max&#x27;s 3 sons featuring: Zyon on drums, Richie on vocals and Igor writing half the guitar riffs). The album was produced by Zeuss with artwork from Marcelo Vasco, who has designed album artwork for bands such as Borknagar, Obituary, and Dimmu Borgir. On December 6, the album title was announced to be &quot;Enslaved&quot; and has a release date of March 13, 2012. Soulfly performed at the 13th annual Gathering of the Juggalos in Cave-in-Rock, IL August 2012. Throughout 2012, Soulfly have headlined the &quot;Maximum Cavalera Tour&quot;, supported by Incite (fronted by Richie Cavalera) and Lody Kong (featuring Igor Cavalera Jr. and Zyon Cavalera). In October 2012 Kinkade announced his retirement from drumming, leaving Soulfly after their show in Bangkok. Max&#x27;s son Zyon, who performed during the South America tour earlier in the year, will take over drums for the upcoming US tour and for the foreseeable future.

In April 2013 Max announced Soulfly&#x27;s intention to record more material after their tour, with producer Terry Date, and confirmed on May 3 that Zyon would perform drums on the album. In July Max announced that the album would be called &quot;Savages&quot;. The band released the album on September 30 in the UK, October 1 in the US, and October 4 in Europe. &quot;Savages&quot; features a number of guest vocalists including Igor Cavalera Jr. of Lody Kong, Jamie Hanks of I Declare War, Neil Fallon of Clutch, and Mitch Harris of Napalm Death.

=== &quot;Archangel&quot; and &quot;Ritual&quot; (2014–2019) ===

On December 6, 2014, Max Cavalera said through an interview that he started writing for the tenth Soulfly record. Cavalera and his gang entered the studio on January 3, 2015. On May 1, bassist Tony Campos announced via his Facebook page that he was leaving Soulfly to join Fear Factory. &quot;Archangel&quot;, produced by Matt Hyde, was released on August 14, 2015, through Nuclear Blast. They embarked on the &quot;We Sold Our Souls To Metal&quot; tour on September 30, 2015, to promote the album. The tour was accompanied by the bands Soilwork, Decapitated and Shattered Sun. The tour lasted for a 27 show trek ending in Albuquerque, NM on October 30. They played at The Rockbar Theater in San Jose, CA on December 12, 2015.

In 2017, they toured North America with Cannabis Corpse, Harm&#x27;s Way, Noisem and Lody Kong. In this tour, they played the Nailbomb album &quot;Point Blank&quot; in full, bringing Igor Jr. into the band as co-lead vocalist and keyboardist/sampler for the tour. After releasing his latest album with Cavalera Conspiracy, Max revealed his plans to finish writing and recording the next Soulfly album in early 2018, while also declaring his intentions to bring back some of the tribal elements from the band&#x27;s early days to commemorate 20 years since Soulfly&#x27;s self-titled debut album. A live album of their performance at 1998 Dynamo Open Air, entitled simply &quot;Live at Dynamo Open Air 1998&quot;, was released on June 22, 2018.

Soulfly released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Ritual&quot;, on October 19, 2018.

===Departure of Marc Rizzo and &quot;Totem&quot; (2020–2023)===

In a June 2020 interview on Kazakhstan&#x27;s &quot;Armatura&quot; podcast, Cavalera confirmed that he had been &quot;writing some riffs&quot; for the twelfth Soulfly album. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m very inspired right now for riffs and music. I listen to a lot of heavy stuff. So I&#x27;ve been composing new Soulfly music, hopefully for next year. So I think next year we&#x27;ll have a new Soulfly record.&quot; In a May 2021 interview with Finland&#x27;s Kaaos TV, Cavalera further reiterated the album&#x27;s progress and confirmed that it would likely not be released before 2022: &quot;We&#x27;re just working on it. We&#x27;re still just developing it. It&#x27;s in the early stages of being recorded. We recorded some, and we have to record a little bit more. But we&#x27;re just really taking our time.&quot; During the 2022 tour, Cavalera announced the new album would come out around the month of July 2022. 

In August 2021, it was announced lead guitarist Marc Rizzo had left the band, and that his replacement on the 2021 North American tour would be Dino Cazares of Fear Factory. On May 5, 2022, the band released the single &quot;Superstition&quot; and announced that the new album&#x27;s title would be &quot;Totem&quot;, which was released on August 5.

On January 5, 2023, the band announced Mike DeLeon of Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals as the band&#x27;s new touring guitarist. It was later revealed that other guitarists were also planned to cover many of the tour dates for 2023.

===Upcoming thirteenth studio album (2024–present)===
In a January 2024 interview on the &quot;Nu Pod With Joshua Toomey and Ro Kohli&quot; podcast, Cavalera confirmed that he would be &quot;working on new Soulfly this year, writing and hopefully recording&quot; the band&#x27;s next album for a 2025 release.

<text>Rant in E-Minor is an album by stand-up comedian and satirist Bill Hicks. Both this album and a similar album of new material, &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;, were released posthumously by Rykodisc on February 25, 1997, marking three years since Hicks&#x27; death.

The material on this album is darker and angrier in tone than some of his earlier work; Hicks can be heard screaming at his audience in between chapters, and very prominently during the track &quot;You&#x27;re Wrong Night&quot;.

On April 15, 2016, Comedy Dynamics released a new version of the album in both double CD and double vinyl LP formats called &quot;Rant in E-Minor: Variations&quot;. While the original album was culled from various performances and included musical interludes performed by Hicks, the new version presents a complete and uninterrupted performance recorded at the Laff Stop in Austin, Texas on October 24, 1993.

<text>Alive or Just Breathing is the second studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was released on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was Killswitch Engage&#x27;s first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band&#x27;s first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album to the best of their abilities. &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, Leach left the band for personal and health issues. Killswitch Engage quickly recruited Howard Jones to replace Leach. Jones would stay in the band for nearly ten years, until his departure in 2012, which prompted Leach to rejoin the band on the ten-year anniversary of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;. This is also the last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, as he would switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.

==Background==
In June 2000, Killswitch Engage released their debut album, titled &quot;Killswitch Engage&quot; through Ferret Records. The band got its recording deal as a favor for the artwork bassist Mike D&#x27;Antonio created for Ferret. The label&#x27;s CEO, Carl Severson signed the band without a contract simply to get the album out to the public because he thought the album &quot;ruled&quot;, and stated &quot;I had a one-off deal and when I knew they wanted to go someplace bigger, I figured it was in my best interest, as their friend, to make the best thing happen for them.&quot; After the album was released, Severson showed it to Roadrunner Records A&amp;R man, Mike Gitter.

Gitter played the album for other Roadrunner employees and stated &quot;The feeling was this was something that touched upon classic metal, pulls it up through hardcore, and creates something fairly new and completely exciting. When their music started circulating around the office, there was an immediate &#x27;Holy ... this is great!&#x27; feeling about it. People weren&#x27;t halfway about it.&quot; Gitter offered to sign the band to the label and felt that signing Killswitch Engage was the label&#x27;s last chance to have any heavy metal bands on the roster. The band was apprehensive at first, judging by the artist roster of Roadrunner at the time, but after nearly six months of deliberation, Killswitch Engage signed to Roadrunner due to the opportunities it provided for them. After signing, the band began work on their major label debut, which would become &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;. Gitter has claimed that signing Killswitch Engage was the most gratifying signing of his career.

==Writing and recording==

===Writing===
In summer of 2001, Killswitch Engage recorded a demo produced by drummer/guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz which featured the songs &quot;Transfiguration&quot; (which would later become &quot;Fixation on the Darkness&quot;), &quot;Just Barely Breathing&quot;, and &quot;Numbered Days&quot;. After giving the demo to Roadrunner, the label agreed to let Dutkiewicz produce &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; because they were impressed with his production skills.

As Killswitch Engage started writing for &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, then-guitarist Pete Cortese, who co-wrote &quot;Fixation on the Darkness&quot;, left the band to spend more with his family. The music for &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was all written by Dutkiewicz, D&#x27;Antonio, and guitarist Joel Stroetzel, while all of the lyrics were written by singer Jesse Leach. After completing the composition for the album, the band knew they would need to find a second guitarist to play with Stroetzel, because &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was written for two guitarists during live performances.

Taking into account that this would be the band&#x27;s first album on a major label, Killswitch Engage was adamant on making the best album that they could. This required Dutkiewicz to spend more time in the studio producing and writing songs as a whole, rather than just a collection of guitar riffs put together. D&#x27;Antonio stated the writing process for the record went very fast as he wrote the &quot;moshy, hardcore&quot; style riffs, Stroetzel wrote the thrash metal styled riffs, and Dutkiewicz wrote the &quot;catchy&quot; choruses. Leach said that his main goal when writing lyrics was to be used as an instrument to shine the light of God through his music. He felt that music lyrics in general featured too much negativity and wanted to have positivity shown in his. Jesse has also stated in an Instagram comment that the album &quot;Life. Love. Regret.&quot; by Unbroken was massively influential to the lyrics of the Alive or Just Breathing.

===Recording===
On November 3, 2001, Killswitch Engage entered Zing Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts to begin recording &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;. Upon entering the studio, the album already had its title, derived from a lyric in the song &quot;Just Barely Breathing.&quot; The band members all had jobs and some were going to school during the recording of the album, so each member came in for short periods as they had time available. Stroetzel said this was helpful, as it reduced stress, but regretted that they were not able to get more done in one session. A problem that D&#x27;Antonio, Dutkiewicz, and Stroetzel encountered was keeping their guitars in tune during the sessions. They spent a large amount of the recording budget buying new guitars to improve the tuning. Since the recording of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, they have learned how to keep in tune better as they record.

Jesse Leach had troubles gaining confidence as he was recording his vocals, but was determined to make them a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Leach spoke of Dutkiewicz and recording vocals stating, &quot;I definitely hand it to Adam D. – he&#x27;s the man. We&#x27;re taking our time, dissecting things. It&#x27;s made me push myself to my limits – getting a lot more passion and deliver out of what I&#x27;m doing.&quot; After struggling with nervousness for a while, Dutkiewicz and Leach went to Leach&#x27;s home in Rhode Island to finish recording vocals. Mike Gitter was reluctant to hear of this when Killswitch Engage turned the record into Roadrunner, but was ultimately pleased with the results. Before the completion of the record, the band brought in Tom Gomes to play drums as Dutkiewicz moved to the empty guitar position. Though Dutkiewicz recorded most of the drums himself, Gomes provided additional percussion on the album, before he was an official member of the band. Backing vocals on &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; were done by Leach, Dutkiewicz, as well as Dutkiewicz&#x27;s sister Becka, and All That Remains singer Philip Labonte.

During the &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; recording sessions, Killswitch Engage recorded 15 songs. Three of the songs were re-recordings of songs from the band&#x27;s debut album. Stroetzel stated that the band decided to re-record &quot;Temple From the Within&quot;, &quot;Vide Infra&quot;, and &quot;In the Unblind&quot; because at the time, Killswitch Engage was unsure of how many people would ever hear &quot;Killswitch Engage&quot; because it was released through a small label. &quot;Temple From the Within&quot; and &quot;Vide Infra&quot; made it onto &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;. &quot;In the Unblind&quot; and two newly written songs titled &quot;When the Balance is Broken&quot; and &quot;Untitled and Unloved&quot; respectively, did not make it on to the album, but would eventually be heard on the 2005 reissue of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;.

&quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was mixed in February 2002 at Backstage Productions in Ripley, Derbyshire, UK by Andy Sneap. Dutkiewicz brought the album to the UK and oversaw the mixing process. The band chose Sneap after hearing good things about his work. The band and label were both very pleased with the mix, and Dutkiewicz in particular noted his satisfaction with the drum tones.

===Artwork and packaging===
Mike D&#x27;Antonio owns a graphic design company called Darkicon Designs and has made album covers and various other pieces of art (T-shirts, posters, logos, etc.) for bands such as Shadows Fall, All That Remains, Crowbar among others. Killswitch Engage made sure to have written in their contract with Roadrunner that D&#x27;Antonio would produce all of the band&#x27;s artwork. D&#x27;Antonio stated about the cover of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, &quot;I wanted something that looked &#x27;old school cut-and-paste&#x27; for the cover. Something with texture that appeared like it was just laid down and photographed. I remember Roadrunner hating the cover, saying there was too much going on and nothing to focus on. I told them I did not agree, and that some day they would get it.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was released on May 21, 2002. Killswitch Engage filmed a music video for the song &quot;My Last Serenade&quot;, which gained heavy rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and propelled the album to number 37 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers chart. &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; also stayed at number one on CMJ&#x27;s Loud Rock radio chart for over a month. By the time the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; was released, &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; sold 114,000 copies in the United States. Music videos were also filmed for &quot;Life to Lifeless&quot; and &quot;Fixation on the Darkness&quot;. Upon the release of the album, Killswitch Engage embarked on their first nationwide tour, supporting Soilwork and Hypocrisy and would tour for the next year in support of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;. Other legs of the tour featured the band touring with acts such as Kittie, Poison the Well, Shadows Fall, and Hotwire.

Missing his wife whom he had married two weeks prior to the tour, Jesse Leach left Killswitch Engage in the middle of their first national tour. With a combination of depression, missing his wife, and throat problems, Leach sent D&#x27;Antonio an email just a few days before the band was scheduled to play a show, announcing his departure. D&#x27;Antonio stated in an interview that &quot;after three years of hanging out with the dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email was a little bit harsh.&quot; Killswitch Engage very quickly set up auditions to fill the vocalist position in the band and eventually settled on Howard Jones, who was at the time the frontman of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones very quickly had to learn a set of songs to tour with the band. Leach and the rest of the band quickly reconciled and remained close friends.

After the touring process for the album was over, Tom Gomes left the band and was replaced by Justin Foley. This line-up of Killswitch Engage would last until early 2012, when Jones left the band. Following Jones&#x27; departure, Jesse Leach rejoined the band on the ten-year anniversary of &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;.

In 2005, as part of Roadrunner&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the label re-released &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; as a special edition. The re-release included a bonus enhanced cd with all of the songs left over from the album&#x27;s recording sessions, as well as a re-recorded version of &quot;Fixation on the Darkness&quot;, featuring Jones on lead vocals, a track of studio outtakes and music videos for &quot;My Last Serenade&quot;, &quot;Fixation on the Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Life to Lifeless&quot;. The special edition also included expanded artwork and a biography documenting the recording and release of the album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was met with rave reviews. Erik Thomas from Metalreview.com said &quot;while this album certainly is responsible for the vast amount of saturation, it stands as a pretty trendsetting, stellar must-own example of metalcore.&quot; Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic stated &quot;This is a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer.&quot; Taylor also expressed the impressiveness of the band&#x27;s &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; work ethic as Dutkiewicz handled all production and D&#x27;Antonio &quot;took the time to give much thought on the album&#x27;s packaging and art direction.&quot; Dom Lawson of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine gave the album five &quot;Ks&quot; (or five out of five stars). He praised the album&#x27;s unique new sound, music, and vocal performances from Leach. Kevin Boyce of &quot;CMJ&quot; said, &quot;This album is more addictive than crack cocaine that&#x27;s been smothered in caffeine and nicotine and drenched with chocolate. Starting with the track &#x27;Numbered Days,&#x27; this 12-track platter never takes its foot off of the throttle.&quot; Boyce also stated his favorite song from the album was &quot;My Last Serenade,&quot; and applauded &quot;Just Barely Breathing,&quot; comparing parts of it to Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;.

Reviewing the 2005 re-release of the album, Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net said that &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; is &quot;one special album&quot; and that its release &quot;marked a defining moment in metal.&quot; Alisoglu also viewed the album as one of the greatest albums of 2002 and of &quot;the new century.&quot; &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; is one of only 21 albums to have a perfect site rating on Blabbermouth.net. In 2009, MetalSucks compiled a list of the &quot;21 Best Metal Albums of the 21st Century So Far&quot; based on the opinions of various musicians, managers, publicists, label representatives and writers, where &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was placed at number four on the list. Noisecreep posted a list of the top 10 best metal albums of the past decade in 2010, where the album was listed at number six.

In a review for 411mania.com, Evocator Manes stated his dislike for the melodic &quot;smooth parts&quot; that he felt were too repetitious throughout &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, however he praised the album&#x27;s production and positive lyrics. Jesse Leach stated there was a small portion of Killswitch Engage fans who disliked his use of clean singing on the album.

<text>In numismatics, the term milled coinage (also known as machine-struck coinage) is used to describe coins which are produced by some form of machine, rather than by manually hammering coin blanks between two dies (hammered coinage) or casting coins from dies.

==Introduction==
Until 1550, coinage techniques used in European mints had not progressed from the hammered coinage of Ancient Greece. This was problematic because an increase in the supply of bullion from central Europe and America was overworking mints. That led to low quality coins which were easily forged or clipped, i.e. precious metal was shaved from the edges of the coins. In accordance with Gresham&#x27;s law, the clipped and forged coins drove good coins out of circulation, depreciating the currency.

Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s notebooks showed there was a better way and Donato Bramante, the architect who made the initial plans for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, developed a screw press to make the lead bullae attached to Papal documents. In 1550, the French ambassador to Augsburg, Charles de Marillac, saw a way for France to get an economic advantage over the Holy Roman Empire when he learned that a local engineer had perfected a mechanical process of rolling bullion to the required thickness, cutting blanks from the rolled metal, and striking coins from those blanks. This technology was significantly more advanced than the general manufacturing processes of the 16th century making the coins difficult to counterfeit. The negotiations which obtained rights to the process for France were so secret that the inventor was identified with a codename, but he was most likely Marx Schwab. Aubin Olivier went to Augsburg to learn the technique and Henry II of France made him chief engineer of a mechanized mint in Paris, called the Moulin des Étuves, on 27 March 1551. This mint produced well-struck and perfectly round gold and silver coins. Having perfectly round coins made it easy to detect clipping, but the coiners&#x27; establishment would have none of this and within a decade the Moulin des Étuves&#x27; ex-employees were finding work in Navarre and England.
In England, a 1560 proclamation of Elizabeth I exchanged old debased coins for new pure coins. The Tower Mint added machinery to its hammering for this &quot;great recoinage&quot;. Eloy Mestrelle undertook the technology transfer from France, but when the great recoinage ended, mint authorities found him redundant and in 1578 he was hanged for counterfeiting. In 1632, Charles I employed another French refugee, Nicholas Briot, to improve coinage standards in both England and Scotland, which had its own coinage until 1707, but the English Civil War ended his machine coinage. Yet another Frenchman, Peter Blondeau, provided machinery for a proposed coinage designed by Thomas Simon with Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s portrait. The restoration of 1660 ended that, but in 1662 Charles II recalled Blondeau to establish a permanent machine-made coinage. He employed a secret process for placing lettering or other designs on the edges of coins. The inscription chosen for the edge—DECVS ET TVTAMEN, meaning an ornament and a safeguard—refers to the protection against clipping which the lettered edge provided. In accordance with Gresham&#x27;s law, however, the inferior hammered coins limited the circulation of his coins until the hammered coins were demonetized in 1695.

Meanwhile, in continental Europe, France readopted machine made coins in 1639. Both machine-made and hammered coins continued through the recoinage of French silver in 1641, but by now machine-made coinage&#x27;s time had come, and hammered French coinage ended in 1645. Zürich and Heidelberg experimented with coinage machinery in 1558 and 1567 respectively, and the Hall mint in Tirol permanently adopted coinage machinery in 1567. Unlike the screw press used in France and England, Hall used a roller press. Here two cylindrical dies impressed designs on bullion which rolled between them. Coins were then cut from the rolled and impressed metal. This technique spread from Hall to Cologne in 1568, Dresden in 1574, Kremnica and Danzig in 1577, as well as other small mints. Its most significant impact occurred when Philip II of Spain used his personal funds to build a mint at Segovia which used this technique to convert silver from the Americas to coins efficiently. This allowed the king to pay his debts at a better rate than he otherwise could. The Segovia mint was owned by the King&#x27;s Royal House; but other Spanish mints, which were run by the National Treasury, continued hammered coinage for decades.

==Coins of the Industrial Revolution==
The Industrial Revolution shifted the focus of the economy from a rural to an urban, money based, enterprise. The main technology of the Industrial Revolution, the Watt steam engine, also increased the overall level of economic activity. Both of these factors increased the demand for money. Factories were financed by introducing paper money and credit, but low-denomination coins were required to pay their workers and in England copper coins were scarce. Matthew Boulton had backed Watt&#x27;s development of the steam engine, and he used it to power coin-making machinery at his Soho Manufactory. Boulton struck coins for the East India Company, supplied steam powered coining machinery to the Moscow mint, and manufactured private tokens which circulated widely in England. In 1797, Boulton received a contract to strike royal British copper coins called cartwheels. In 1805, he received a further contract to supply steam powered coinage machinery when the British Royal Mint left the Tower of London and established a new facility on Little Tower Hill.

==In the Americas and East Asia==
When Spain introduced coinage to America in 1536, coins were still hammered. The fineness of the silver in this coinage was reduced in 1732 and the Mexico City mint began striking the new coins using machinery. Other Spanish American mints followed and their thaler size silver coins are widely known as Spanish Milled Dollars.
The Spanish Milled Dollar, and its successor the Mexican Peso, were widely used in trade with the Sinosphere, where coins were previously cast. In what is now Vietnam, emperor Minh Mạng introduced a coin based on the Spanish Milled Dollar in 1832. The subsequent French rulers of the area had a coinage based on the Spanish Milled Dollar struck at the Paris mint. Commodore Perry opened Japan to foreign trade, which was mostly paid for in Mexican pesos, in 1853. In 1870, two years after the shogunate was overthrown, the restored Emperor Meiji built a mint at Osaka and imported minting machinery from Birmingham, England for it. Likewise, Spanish Milled Dollars and Mexican pesos became the primary currency used for trade in large parts of southern China during the mid 1800s. China struck similar coins for Turkestan in 1877, and for its own use in 1890.

In modern practice in the United States, milling, or a milled edge, can refer to the raised edge on the coin face, applied by a special milling machine after the planchets are cut out and polished. In addition, the reeding of coins of higher value, applied by the collar holding the coin when it is stamped, can be considered part of the milled edge.

<text>Venice is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 162. It is south of New Orleans on the west bank of the Mississippi River at . It is the last community down the Mississippi accessible by automobile, and it is the southern terminus of the Great River Road. This has earned the town the nickname &quot;The end of the world.&quot; The ZIP code for Venice is 70091.

In 2001, the combined population for Venice and the neighboring communities of Orchard (often considered a part of Venice) and Boothville, Louisiana, was about 2,740 people, with about 975 families. About 460 of those people lived in Venice.

Venice has a diverse variety of fish. It is known as the starting point for many doing offshore fishing, who then head to Port Eads. Its main offshore rival is nearby Grand Isle.

==History==

In 1969, Venice was almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Camille. The pressure fell below 950 hPa, with winds over 100 miles per hour. The community would be devastated again 36 years later by Hurricane Katrina.

In 2000, a deck hand on a shrimp boat was accused of the murder of his captain, whose body was discovered a few days after a storm on the Gulf of Mexico. The media, including newspapers in the city, discovered that the man had been coerced into making a false confession, and he was eventually acquitted. 

Venice was again almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Since then, significant reconstruction, reopening, and reoccupation has taken place. The high bridge leading to Venice was not destroyed during the hurricane.

In late April 2010, Venice faced an environmental disaster when oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began washing ashore in the community.

==Geography==
Venice is located along the west bank of the Mississippi River at 29°16′37″N, 89°21′17″W. It has an area of , of which is land and is water.

==Demographics==


In 2020 its population was 162.

==Industry==
Local industries include commercial and sport fishing, as well as service and transport for off-shore petroleum platforms.

==Education==
Plaquemines Parish School Board operates the public schools of the parish.

It is served by Boothville-Venice Elementary School in Boothville and South Plaquemines High School in Buras. Prior to 2005 Boothville-Venice High School (PreK-12) served the community, but Hurricane Katrina damaged the original building.

Plaquemines Parish is in the service area of Nunez Community College.

<doc id="221519" wikidata="Q1047080" url="?curid=221519" title="Differential form">
<text>In mathematics, differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds. The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan. It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.

For instance, the expression formula_1 is an example of a -form, and can be integrated over an interval formula_2 contained in the domain of formula_3:
: formula_4
Similarly, the expression formula_5 is a -form that can be integrated over a surface formula_6:
: formula_7
The symbol formula_8 denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the &quot;wedge product&quot;, of two differential forms. Likewise, a -form formula_9 represents a volume element that can be integrated over a region of space. In general, a -form is an object that may be integrated over a -dimensional manifold, and is homogeneous of degree in the coordinate differentials formula_10
On an -dimensional manifold, a top-dimensional form (-form) is called a &quot;volume form&quot;.

The differential forms form an alternating algebra. This implies that formula_11 and formula_12 This alternating property reflects the orientation of the domain of integration. 

The exterior derivative is an operation on differential forms that, given a -form formula_13, produces a -form formula_14 This operation extends the differential of a function (a function can be considered as a -form, and its differential is formula_15). This allows expressing the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green&#x27;s theorem, and Stokes&#x27; theorem as special cases of a single general result, the generalized Stokes theorem.

Differential -forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a differentiable manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and -forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product. The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds. This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms. As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.

== History ==
Differential forms are part of the field of differential geometry, influenced by linear algebra. Although the notion of a differential is quite old, the initial attempt at an algebraic organization of differential forms is usually credited to Élie Cartan with reference to his 1899 paper. Some aspects of the exterior algebra of differential forms appears in Hermann Grassmann&#x27;s 1844 work, &quot;Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik (The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics)&quot;.

== Concept ==

Differential forms provide an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.

=== Integration and orientation ===
A differential -form can be integrated over an oriented manifold of dimension . A differential -form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal oriented length, or 1-dimensional oriented density. A differential -form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal oriented area, or 2-dimensional oriented density. And so on.

Integration of differential forms is well-defined only on oriented manifolds. An example of a 1-dimensional manifold is an interval , and intervals can be given an orientation: they are positively oriented if , and negatively oriented otherwise. If then the integral of the differential -form over the interval (with its natural positive orientation) is
: formula_16
which is the negative of the integral of the same differential form over the same interval, when equipped with the opposite orientation. That is:
: formula_17
This gives a geometrical context to the conventions for one-dimensional integrals, that the sign changes when the orientation of the interval is reversed. A standard explanation of this in one-variable integration theory is that, when the limits of integration are in the opposite order (), the increment is negative in the direction of integration.

More generally, an -form is an oriented density that can be integrated over an -dimensional oriented manifold. (For example, a -form can be integrated over an oriented curve, a -form can be integrated over an oriented surface, etc.) If is an oriented -dimensional manifold, and is the same manifold with opposite orientation and is an -form, then one has:
: formula_18
These conventions correspond to interpreting the integrand as a differential form, integrated over a chain. In measure theory, by contrast, one interprets the integrand as a function with respect to a measure and integrates over a subset , without any notion of orientation; one writes formula_19 to indicate integration over a subset . This is a minor distinction in one dimension, but becomes subtler on higher-dimensional manifolds; see below for details.

Making the notion of an oriented density precise, and thus of a differential form, involves the exterior algebra. The differentials of a set of coordinates, , ..., can be used as a basis for all -forms. Each of these represents a covector at each point on the manifold that may be thought of as measuring a small displacement in the corresponding coordinate direction. A general -form is a linear combination of these differentials at every point on the manifold:
: formula_20
where the are functions of all the coordinates. A differential -form is integrated along an oriented curve as a line integral.

The expressions , where can be used as a basis at every point on the manifold for all -forms. This may be thought of as an infinitesimal oriented square parallel to the –-plane. A general -form is a linear combination of these at every point on the manifold: and it is integrated just like a surface integral.

A fundamental operation defined on differential forms is the exterior product (the symbol is the wedge ). This is similar to the cross product from vector calculus, in that it is an alternating product. For instance,
: formula_21

because the square whose first side is and second side is is to be regarded as having the opposite orientation as the square whose first side is and whose second side is . This is why we only need to sum over expressions , with ; for example: . The exterior product allows higher-degree differential forms to be built out of lower-degree ones, in much the same way that the cross product in vector calculus allows one to compute the area vector of a parallelogram from vectors pointing up the two sides. Alternating also implies that , in the same way that the cross product of parallel vectors, whose magnitude is the area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors, is zero. In higher dimensions, if any two of the indices , ..., are equal, in the same way that the &quot;volume&quot; enclosed by a parallelotope whose edge vectors are linearly dependent is zero.

=== Multi-index notation ===
A common notation for the wedge product of elementary -forms is so called multi-index notation: in an -dimensional context, for we define Another useful notation is obtained by defining the set of all strictly increasing multi-indices of length , in a space of dimension , denoted Then locally (wherever the coordinates apply), formula_22 spans the space of differential -forms in a manifold of dimension , when viewed as a module over the ring of smooth functions on . By calculating the size of formula_23 combinatorially, the module of -forms on an -dimensional manifold, and in general space of -covectors on an -dimensional vector space, is  choose : This also demonstrates that there are no nonzero differential forms of degree greater than the dimension of the underlying manifold.

=== The exterior derivative ===
In addition to the exterior product, there is also the exterior derivative operator . The exterior derivative of a differential form is a generalization of the differential of a function, in the sense that the exterior derivative of is exactly the differential of . When generalized to higher forms, if is a simple -form, then its exterior derivative is a -form defined by taking the differential of the coefficient functions:
: formula_24
with extension to general -forms through linearity: if a_I \, dx^I \in \Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;,}} then its exterior derivative is
: formula_25

In , with the Hodge star operator, the exterior derivative corresponds to gradient, curl, and divergence, although this correspondence, like the cross product, does not generalize to higher dimensions, and should be treated with some caution. 

The exterior derivative itself applies in an arbitrary finite number of dimensions, and is a flexible and powerful tool with wide application in differential geometry, differential topology, and many areas in physics. Of note, although the above definition of the exterior derivative was defined with respect to local coordinates, it can be defined in an entirely coordinate-free manner, as an antiderivation of degree 1 on the exterior algebra of differential forms. The benefit of this more general approach is that it allows for a natural coordinate-free approach to integrate on manifolds. It also allows for a natural generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, called the (generalized) Stokes&#x27; theorem, which is a central result in the theory of integration on manifolds.

=== Differential calculus ===
Let be an open set in . A differential -form (&quot;zero-form&quot;) is defined to be a smooth function on – the set of which is denoted . If is any vector in , then has a directional derivative , which is another function on whose value at a point is the rate of change (at ) of in the direction:
: formula_26
(This notion can be extended pointwise to the case that is a vector field on by evaluating at the point in the definition.)

In particular, if is the th coordinate vector then is the partial derivative of with respect to the th coordinate vector, i.e., , where , , ..., are the coordinate vectors in . By their very definition, partial derivatives depend upon the choice of coordinates: if new coordinates , , ..., are introduced, then
: formula_27

The first idea leading to differential forms is the observation that is a linear function of :

: formula_28

for any vectors , and any real number . At each point &quot;p&quot;, this linear map from to is denoted and called the derivative or differential of at . Thus . Extended over the whole set, the object can be viewed as a function that takes a vector field on , and returns a real-valued function whose value at each point is the derivative along the vector field of the function . Note that at each , the differential is not a real number, but a linear functional on tangent vectors, and a prototypical example of a differential -form.

Since any vector is a linear combination of its components, is uniquely determined by for each and each , which are just the partial derivatives of on . Thus provides a way of encoding the partial derivatives of . It can be decoded by noticing that the coordinates , , ..., are themselves functions on , and so define differential -forms , , ..., . Let . Since , the Kronecker delta function, it follows that

The meaning of this expression is given by evaluating both sides at an arbitrary point : on the right hand side, the sum is defined &quot;pointwise&quot;, so that
: formula_29
Applying both sides to , the result on each side is the th partial derivative of at . Since and were arbitrary, this proves the formula .

More generally, for any smooth functions and on , we define the differential -form pointwise by
: formula_30
for each . Any differential -form arises this way, and by using it follows that any differential -form on may be expressed in coordinates as
: formula_31
for some smooth functions on .

The second idea leading to differential forms arises from the following question: given a differential -form on , when does there exist a function on such that ? The above expansion reduces this question to the search for a function whose partial derivatives are equal to given functions . For , such a function does not always exist: any smooth function satisfies
: formula_32
so it will be impossible to find such an unless
: formula_33
for all and .

The skew-symmetry of the left hand side in and suggests introducing an antisymmetric product on differential -forms, the exterior product, so that these equations can be combined into a single condition
: formula_34
where is defined so that:
: formula_35

This is an example of a differential -form. This -form is called the exterior derivative of . It is given by
: formula_36

To summarize: is a necessary condition for the existence of a function with .

Differential -forms, -forms, and -forms are special cases of differential forms. For each , there is a space of differential -forms, which can be expressed in terms of the coordinates as
: formula_37
for a collection of functions . Antisymmetry, which was already present for -forms, makes it possible to restrict the sum to those sets of indices for which .

Differential forms can be multiplied together using the exterior product, and for any differential -form , there is a differential -form called the exterior derivative of .

Differential forms, the exterior product and the exterior derivative are independent of a choice of coordinates. Consequently, they may be defined on any smooth manifold . One way to do this is cover with coordinate charts and define a differential -form on to be a family of differential -forms on each chart which agree on the overlaps. However, there are more intrinsic definitions which make the independence of coordinates manifest.

== Intrinsic definitions ==
Let be a smooth manifold. A smooth differential form of degree is a smooth section of the th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of . The set of all differential -forms on a manifold is a vector space, often denoted formula_38.

The definition of a differential form may be restated as follows. At any point formula_39, a -form formula_40 defines an element
: formula_41
where formula_42 is the tangent space to at and formula_43 is its dual space. This space is to the fiber at of the dual bundle of the th exterior power of the tangent bundle of . That is, formula_40 is also a linear functional formula_45, i.e. the dual of the th exterior power is isomorphic to the th exterior power of the dual:
: formula_46

By the universal property of exterior powers, this is equivalently an alternating multilinear map:
: formula_47
Consequently, a differential -form may be evaluated against any -tuple of tangent vectors to the same point of . For example, a differential -form assigns to each point formula_39 a linear functional on formula_42. In the presence of an inner product on formula_42 (induced by a Riemannian metric on ), may be represented as the inner product with a tangent vector formula_51. Differential -forms are sometimes called covariant vector fields, covector fields, or &quot;dual vector fields&quot;, particularly within physics.

The exterior algebra may be embedded in the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map. The alternation map is defined as a mapping 
: formula_52
For a tensor formula_53 at a point ,
:formula_54
where is the symmetric group on elements. The alternation map is constant on the cosets of the ideal in the tensor algebra generated by the symmetric 2-forms, and therefore descends to an embedding
: formula_55

This map exhibits formula_40 as a totally antisymmetric covariant tensor field of rank . The differential forms on are in one-to-one correspondence with such tensor fields.

== Operations ==
As well as the addition and multiplication by scalar operations which arise from the vector space structure, there are several other standard operations defined on differential forms. The most important operations are the exterior product of two differential forms, the exterior derivative of a single differential form, the interior product of a differential form and a vector field, the Lie derivative of a differential form with respect to a vector field and the covariant derivative of a differential form with respect to a vector field on a manifold with a defined connection.

=== Exterior product ===
The exterior product of a -form and an -form , denoted , is a ()-form. At each point of the manifold , the forms and are elements of an exterior power of the cotangent space at . When the exterior algebra is viewed as a quotient of the tensor algebra, the exterior product corresponds to the tensor product (modulo the equivalence relation defining the exterior algebra).

The antisymmetry inherent in the exterior algebra means that when is viewed as a multilinear functional, it is alternating. However, when the exterior algebra is embedded as a subspace of the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map, the tensor product is not alternating. There is an explicit formula which describes the exterior product in this situation. The exterior product is
: formula_57
If the embedding of formula_58 into formula_59 is done via the map formula_60 instead of formula_61, the exterior product is
: formula_62
This description is useful for explicit computations. For example, if , then is the -form whose value at a point is the alternating bilinear form defined by
: formula_63
for .

The exterior product is bilinear: If , , and are any differential forms, and if is any smooth function, then
: formula_64
: formula_65

It is &quot;skew commutative&quot; (also known as &quot;graded commutative&quot;), meaning that it satisfies a variant of anticommutativity that depends on the degrees of the forms: if is a -form and is an -form, then
: formula_66
One also has the graded Leibniz rule:formula_67

=== Riemannian manifold ===
On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the metric defines a fibre-wise isomorphism of the tangent and cotangent bundles. This makes it possible to convert vector fields to covector fields and vice versa. It also enables the definition of additional operations such as the Hodge star operator formula_68 and the codifferential formula_69, which has degree and is adjoint to the exterior differential .

==== Vector field structures ====
On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, -forms can be identified with vector fields; vector fields have additional distinct algebraic structures, which are listed here for context and to avoid confusion.

Firstly, each (co)tangent space generates a Clifford algebra, where the product of a (co)vector with itself is given by the value of a quadratic form – in this case, the natural one induced by the metric. This algebra is &quot;distinct&quot; from the exterior algebra of differential forms, which can be viewed as a Clifford algebra where the quadratic form vanishes (since the exterior product of any vector with itself is zero). Clifford algebras are thus non-anticommutative (&quot;quantum&quot;) deformations of the exterior algebra. They are studied in geometric algebra.

Another alternative is to consider vector fields as derivations. The (noncommutative) algebra of differential operators they generate is the Weyl algebra and is a noncommutative (&quot;quantum&quot;) deformation of the &quot;symmetric&quot; algebra in the vector fields.

=== Exterior differential complex ===
One important property of the exterior derivative is that . This means that the exterior derivative defines a cochain complex:
: formula_70

This complex is called the de Rham complex, and its cohomology is by definition the de Rham cohomology of . By the Poincaré lemma, the de Rham complex is locally exact except at . The kernel at is the space of locally constant functions on . Therefore, the complex is a resolution of the constant sheaf , which in turn implies a form of de Rham&#x27;s theorem: de Rham cohomology computes the sheaf cohomology of .

== Pullback ==
Suppose that is smooth. The differential of is a smooth map between the tangent bundles of and . This map is also denoted and called the pushforward. For any point and any tangent vector , there is a well-defined pushforward vector in . However, the same is not true of a vector field. If is not injective, say because has two or more preimages, then the vector field may determine two or more distinct vectors in . If is not surjective, then there will be a point at which does not determine any tangent vector at all. Since a vector field on determines, by definition, a unique tangent vector at every point of , the pushforward of a vector field does not always exist.

By contrast, it is always possible to pull back a differential form. A differential form on may be viewed as a linear functional on each tangent space. Precomposing this functional with the differential defines a linear functional on each tangent space of and therefore a differential form on . The existence of pullbacks is one of the key features of the theory of differential forms. It leads to the existence of pullback maps in other situations, such as pullback homomorphisms in de Rham cohomology.

Formally, let be smooth, and let be a smooth -form on . Then there is a differential form on , called the pullback of , which captures the behavior of as seen relative to . To define the pullback, fix a point of and tangent vectors , ..., to at . The pullback of is defined by the formula
:formula_71

There are several more abstract ways to view this definition. If is a -form on , then it may be viewed as a section of the cotangent bundle of . Using to denote a dual map, the dual to the differential of is . The pullback of may be defined to be the composite
: formula_72
This is a section of the cotangent bundle of and hence a differential -form on . In full generality, let formula_73 denote the th exterior power of the dual map to the differential. Then the pullback of a -form is the composite
: formula_74, formula_75.

== Integration ==
A differential -form can be integrated over an oriented -dimensional manifold. When the -form is defined on an -dimensional manifold with , then the -form can be integrated over oriented -dimensional submanifolds. If , integration over oriented 0-dimensional submanifolds is just the summation of the integrand evaluated at points, according to the orientation of those points. Other values of correspond to line integrals, surface integrals, volume integrals, and so on. There are several equivalent ways to formally define the integral of a differential form, all of which depend on reducing to the case of Euclidean space.

=== Integration on Euclidean space ===
Let be an open subset of . Give its standard orientation and the restriction of that orientation. Every smooth -form on has the form
: formula_76
for some smooth function . Such a function has an integral in the usual Riemann or Lebesgue sense. This allows us to define the integral of to be the integral of :
: formula_77
Fixing an orientation is necessary for this to be well-defined. The skew-symmetry of differential forms means that the integral of, say, must be the negative of the integral of . Riemann and Lebesgue integrals cannot see this dependence on the ordering of the coordinates, so they leave the sign of the integral undetermined. The orientation resolves this ambiguity.

=== Integration over chains ===
Let be an -manifold and an -form on . First, assume that there is a parametrization of by an open subset of Euclidean space. That is, assume that there exists a diffeomorphism
: formula_78
where . Give the orientation induced by . Then defines the integral of over to be the integral of over . In coordinates, this has the following expression. Fix an embedding of in with coordinates . Then
: formula_79
Suppose that is defined by
: formula_80
Then the integral may be written in coordinates as
: formula_81
where
: formula_82
is the determinant of the Jacobian. The Jacobian exists because is differentiable.

In general, an -manifold cannot be parametrized by an open subset of . But such a parametrization is always possible locally, so it is possible to define integrals over arbitrary manifolds by defining them as sums of integrals over collections of local parametrizations. Moreover, it is also possible to define parametrizations of -dimensional subsets for , and this makes it possible to define integrals of -forms. To make this precise, it is convenient to fix a standard domain in , usually a cube or a simplex. A -chain is a formal sum of smooth embeddings . That is, it is a collection of smooth embeddings, each of which is assigned an integer multiplicity. Each smooth embedding determines a -dimensional submanifold of . If the chain is
: formula_83
then the integral of a -form over is defined to be the sum of the integrals over the terms of :
: formula_84

This approach to defining integration does not assign a direct meaning to integration over the whole manifold . However, it is still possible to assign such a meaning indirectly because every smooth manifold may be smoothly triangulated in an essentially unique way, and the integral over may be defined to be the integral over the chain determined by a triangulation.

=== Integration using partitions of unity ===
There is another approach, expounded in , which does directly assign a meaning to integration over , but this approach requires fixing an orientation of . The integral of an -form on an -dimensional manifold is defined by working in charts. Suppose first that is supported on a single positively oriented chart. On this chart, it may be pulled back to an -form on an open subset of . Here, the form has a well-defined Riemann or Lebesgue integral as before. The change of variables formula and the assumption that the chart is positively oriented together ensure that the integral of is independent of the chosen chart. In the general case, use a partition of unity to write as a sum of -forms, each of which is supported in a single positively oriented chart, and define the integral of to be the sum of the integrals of each term in the partition of unity.

It is also possible to integrate -forms on oriented -dimensional submanifolds using this more intrinsic approach. The form is pulled back to the submanifold, where the integral is defined using charts as before. For example, given a path , integrating a -form on the path is simply pulling back the form to a form on , and this integral is the integral of the function on the interval.

=== Integration along fibers ===
Fubini&#x27;s theorem states that the integral over a set that is a product may be computed as an iterated integral over the two factors in the product. This suggests that the integral of a differential form over a product ought to be computable as an iterated integral as well. The geometric flexibility of differential forms ensures that this is possible not just for products, but in more general situations as well. Under some hypotheses, it is possible to integrate along the fibers of a smooth map, and the analog of Fubini&#x27;s theorem is the case where this map is the projection from a product to one of its factors.

Because integrating a differential form over a submanifold requires fixing an orientation, a prerequisite to integration along fibers is the existence of a well-defined orientation on those fibers. Let and be two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions and , respectively. Suppose that is a surjective submersion. This implies that each fiber is -dimensional and that, around each point of , there is a chart on which looks like the projection from a product onto one of its factors. Fix and set . Suppose that
: formula_85
and that does not vanish. Following , there is a unique
: formula_86
which may be thought of as the fibral part of with respect to . More precisely, define to be the inclusion. Then is defined by the property that
: formula_87
where
: formula_88
is any -covector for which
: formula_89
The form may also be notated .

Moreover, for fixed , varies smoothly with respect to . That is, suppose that
: formula_90
is a smooth section of the projection map; we say that is a smooth differential -form on along . Then there is a smooth differential -form on such that, at each ,
:formula_91
This form is denoted . The same construction works if is an -form in a neighborhood of the fiber, and the same notation is used. A consequence is that each fiber is orientable. In particular, a choice of orientation forms on and defines an orientation of every fiber of .

The analog of Fubini&#x27;s theorem is as follows. As before, and are two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions and , and is a surjective submersion. Fix orientations of and , and give each fiber of the induced orientation. Let be an -form on , and let be an -form on that is almost everywhere positive with respect to the orientation of . Then, for almost every , the form is a well-defined integrable form on . Moreover, there is an integrable -form on defined by
: formula_92
Denote this form by
: formula_93
Then proves the generalized Fubini formula
: formula_94

It is also possible to integrate forms of other degrees along the fibers of a submersion. Assume the same hypotheses as before, and let be a compactly supported -form on . Then there is a -form on which is the result of integrating along the fibers of . The form is defined by specifying, at each , how pairs with each -vector at , and the value of that pairing is an integral over that depends only on , , and the orientations of and . More precisely, at each , there is an isomorphism
: formula_95
defined by the interior product
: formula_96
for any choice of volume form in the orientation of . If , then a -vector at determines an -covector at by pullback:
: formula_97
Each of these covectors has an exterior product against , so there is an -form on along defined by
: formula_98
This form depends on the orientation of but not the choice of . Then the -form is uniquely defined by the property
: formula_99
and is smooth . This form also denoted and called the integral of along the fibers of . Integration along fibers is important for the construction of Gysin maps in de Rham cohomology.

Integration along fibers satisfies the projection formula . If is any -form on , then
: formula_100

===Stokes&#x27;s theorem===

The fundamental relationship between the exterior derivative and integration is given by the Stokes&#x27; theorem: If is an ()-form with compact support on and denotes the boundary of with its induced orientation, then
: formula_101

A key consequence of this is that &quot;the integral of a closed form over homologous chains is equal&quot;: If is a closed -form and and are -chains that are homologous (such that is the boundary of a -chain ), then formula_102, since the difference is the integral formula_103.

For example, if is the derivative of a potential function on the plane or , then the integral of over a path from to does not depend on the choice of path (the integral is ), since different paths with given endpoints are homotopic, hence homologous (a weaker condition). This case is called the gradient theorem, and generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus. This path independence is very useful in contour integration.

This theorem also underlies the duality between de Rham cohomology and the homology of chains.

=== Relation with measures ===
On a &quot;general&quot; differentiable manifold (without additional structure), differential forms &quot;cannot&quot; be integrated over subsets of the manifold; this distinction is key to the distinction between differential forms, which are integrated over chains or oriented submanifolds, and measures, which are integrated over subsets. The simplest example is attempting to integrate the -form over the interval . Assuming the usual distance (and thus measure) on the real line, this integral is either or , depending on &quot;orientation:&quot; formula_104, while formula_105. By contrast, the integral of the &quot;measure&quot; on the interval is unambiguously (i.e. the integral of the constant function with respect to this measure is ). Similarly, under a change of coordinates a differential -form changes by the Jacobian determinant , while a measure changes by the &quot;absolute value&quot; of the Jacobian determinant, , which further reflects the issue of orientation. For example, under the map on the line, the differential form pulls back to ; orientation has reversed; while the Lebesgue measure, which here we denote , pulls back to ; it does not change.

In the presence of the additional data of an &quot;orientation&quot;, it is possible to integrate -forms (top-dimensional forms) over the entire manifold or over compact subsets; integration over the entire manifold corresponds to integrating the form over the fundamental class of the manifold, . Formally, in the presence of an orientation, one may identify -forms with densities on a manifold; densities in turn define a measure, and thus can be integrated .

On an orientable but not oriented manifold, there are two choices of orientation; either choice allows one to integrate -forms over compact subsets, with the two choices differing by a sign. On a non-orientable manifold, -forms and densities cannot be identified —notably, any top-dimensional form must vanish somewhere (there are no volume forms on non-orientable manifolds), but there are nowhere-vanishing densities— thus while one can integrate densities over compact subsets, one cannot integrate -forms. One can instead identify densities with top-dimensional pseudoforms.

Even in the presence of an orientation, there is in general no meaningful way to integrate -forms over subsets for because there is no consistent way to use the ambient orientation to orient -dimensional subsets. Geometrically, a -dimensional subset can be turned around in place, yielding the same subset with the opposite orientation; for example, the horizontal axis in a plane can be rotated by 180 degrees. Compare the Gram determinant of a set of vectors in an -dimensional space, which, unlike the determinant of vectors, is always positive, corresponding to a squared number. An orientation of a -submanifold is therefore extra data not derivable from the ambient manifold.

On a Riemannian manifold, one may define a -dimensional Hausdorff measure for any (integer or real), which may be integrated over -dimensional subsets of the manifold. A function times this Hausdorff measure can then be integrated over -dimensional subsets, providing a measure-theoretic analog to integration of -forms. The -dimensional Hausdorff measure yields a density, as above.

=== Currents ===
The differential form analog of a distribution or generalized function is called a current. The space of -currents on is the dual space to an appropriate space of differential -forms. Currents play the role of generalized domains of integration, similar to but even more flexible than chains.

== Applications in physics ==
Differential forms arise in some important physical contexts. For example, in Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism, the Faraday 2-form, or electromagnetic field strength, is
: formula_106
where the are formed from the electromagnetic fields formula_107 and formula_108; e.g., , , or equivalent definitions.

This form is a special case of the curvature form on the principal bundle on which both electromagnetism and general gauge theories may be described. The connection form for the principal bundle is the vector potential, typically denoted by , when represented in some gauge. One then has
: formula_109

The current -form is
: formula_110
where are the four components of the current density. (Here it is a matter of convention to write instead of , i.e. to use capital letters, and to write instead of . However, the vector rsp. tensor components and the above-mentioned forms have different physical dimensions. Moreover, by decision of an international commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, the magnetic polarization vector has been called formula_111 for several decades, and by some publishers ; i.e., the same name is used for different quantities.)

Using the above-mentioned definitions, Maxwell&#x27;s equations can be written very compactly in geometrized units as
: formula_112
where formula_113 denotes the Hodge star operator. Similar considerations describe the geometry of gauge theories in general.

The -form formula_114, which is dual to the Faraday form, is also called Maxwell 2-form.

Electromagnetism is an example of a gauge theory. Here the Lie group is , the one-dimensional unitary group, which is in particular abelian. There are gauge theories, such as Yang–Mills theory, in which the Lie group is not abelian. In that case, one gets relations which are similar to those described here. The analog of the field in such theories is the curvature form of the connection, which is represented in a gauge by a Lie algebra-valued one-form . The Yang–Mills field is then defined by
: formula_115

In the abelian case, such as electromagnetism, , but this does not hold in general. Likewise the field equations are modified by additional terms involving exterior products of and , owing to the structure equations of the gauge group.

== Applications in geometric measure theory ==
Numerous minimality results for complex analytic manifolds are based on the Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms. A succinct proof may be found in Herbert Federer&#x27;s classic text &quot;Geometric Measure Theory&quot;. The Wirtinger inequality is also a key ingredient in Gromov&#x27;s inequality for complex projective space in systolic geometry.

<text>Boothville is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States. Its population was 854 as of the 2010 census, and 718 at the 2020 U.S. census.

Jeré Longman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that before Hurricane Katrina in 2005 the community served as &quot;a hub of the fishing and oil and gas industries; as of September 2023 the Times listed it as &quot;(inundated&quot;).

==History==

Boothville was named for Colonel Booth, a landowner.

==Demographics==
Boothville first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. census.

==Education==
Plaquemines Parish School Board operates the public schools of the parish.

It is served by Boothville-Venice Elementary School in Boothville and South Plaquemines High School in Buras. Prior to 2005 Boothville-Venice High School (PreK-12) served the community, but Hurricane Katrina damaged the original building.

Plaquemines Parish is in the service area of Nunez Community College.

<text>Live/Dead is the first official live album (and fourth overall) released by the rock band Grateful Dead. Recorded over a series of concerts in early 1969 and released later the same year, it was the first live rock album to use 16-track recording.

In 2005 the tracks &quot;Dark Star&quot;, &quot;St. Stephen&quot;, &quot;Death Don&#x27;t Have No Mercy&quot;, &quot;Feedback&quot; and &quot;We Bid You Goodnight&quot; were released, in their original sequence and with a new mix, on the respective February 27, 1969 and March 2, 1969 discs of the &quot;Fillmore West 1969: The Complete Recordings&quot; box set (the first 1:34 of &quot;Dark Star&quot; can be found on the previous track, &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot;). &quot;Feedback&quot; and &quot;We Bid You Goodnight&quot; were also released on the triple disc, highlights release &quot;Fillmore West 1969&quot;.

==Recording==
To assuage debt accrued with their record label from their recent album &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;, as well as fulfill their record contract, the band decided to record a live album. They were also interested in releasing an album more representative of their live performances and actual musicianship, as opposed to the in-studio experimentation of previous albums. The band&#x27;s soundman, Owsley &quot;Bear&quot; Stanley, asked electronics designer Ron Wickersham to invent a microphone splitter that fed both into the PA and the record inputs, with no loss in quality. The songs were recorded with an Ampex 16-track machine.

Kreutzmann later explained, &quot;We got our hands on the latest in recording technology — a sixteen-track recorder (which, of course, is antiquated these days) — and we hauled it up the steps of the Avalon, and later the Fillmore West, and we became the first band ever to make a live sixteen-track recording. We weren’t trying to make history; we were just trying to record a live album. ... Studio versions could never do those songs justice, but advances in live recording (some of which were at our own hands) meant that we could bring the live Dead experience to vinyl&quot;.
Unlike in later years, in early 1969 the contents of the Dead&#x27;s set lists varied little. They improvised the medley of &quot;Dark Star&quot;/&quot;St. Stephen&quot;/&quot;The Eleven&quot; several times a week, which enabled them to explore widely within the songs&#x27; simple frameworks. The &quot;Dark Star / St. Stephen&quot; pairing was taken from the February 27, 1969 show at the Fillmore West; &quot;The Eleven&quot; and &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot; were from the January 26, 1969 show at the Avalon Ballroom; &quot;Death Don&#x27;t Have No Mercy,&quot; &quot;Feedback,&quot; and &quot;And We Bid You Goodnight&quot; were recorded March 2, 1969, at the Fillmore West.

Two songs had seen previous release. &quot;St. Stephen&quot; had appeared in a studio version on &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; and &quot;Dark Star&quot; as a single. &quot;The Eleven&quot; was named for its unusual, complex time signature ( time).

==Title and packaging==
The title has a double meaning. It refers both to the band (the &quot;Dead&quot;) playing live, and is an oxymoron, contrasting the two words in apparent contradiction. The artwork, created by Robert Donovan Thomas (aka Bob Thomas), also illustrated this juxtaposition. The word &quot;Live&quot; is seen on the front cover, and the word &quot;Dead&quot; fills the back cover of the gatefold. Additionally, on the back cover, the top portion of &quot;Dead&quot; somewhat cryptically spells out &quot;Acid&quot;.

The original Warner Bros. LP [#2WS 1830] included an 8.5&quot; × 11&quot; bi-fold insert with Celtic symbols and lyrics for &quot;Saint Stephen&quot;, &quot;The Eleven&quot;, and &quot;Dark Star&quot;. The tracks are presented as one continuous concert. As such, vinyl copies are pressed with automatic sequencing, for stacking on a record changer (Record One containing sides 1 &amp; 4 and Record Two containing sides 2 &amp; 3). CD versions present the track segues without interruption.

==Release==
The album was a financial success for the band in the eyes of their label, Warner Bros. Keyboardist Tom Constanten commented that &quot;Warner Bros. had pointed out that they had sunk $100,000-plus (about $820,000-plus adjusted for 2023) into &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; ... so someone had the idea that if we sent them a double live album, three discs for the price of one wouldn&#x27;t be such a bad deal.&quot; It was the final album with Constanten, who left the band in January 1970.

A six-and-a-half-minute edit of &quot;Turn On Your Lovelight&quot; was issued first on the Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders album &quot;The Big Ball&quot; in 1970, and later on &quot;Skeletons from the Closet: The Best of Grateful Dead&quot;. A two-and-a-half minute edit of &quot;Dark Star&quot; was released on the soundtrack album for &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;, an Antonioni film for which Garcia created additional music. The album&#x27;s version of &quot;St. Stephen&quot; appears on the 1977 Grateful Dead compilation &quot;What a Long Strange Trip It&#x27;s Been&quot;, but fades out during the final verse.

&quot;Live/Dead&quot; was expanded with hidden bonus tracks as part of the 2001 box set &quot;The Golden Road (1965–1973)&quot;, and has a longer intro on &quot;Dark Star&quot;. This version was released separately in 2003.

==Reception and legacy==

The album was met with very positive reviews, with &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau writing that it &quot;contains the finest rock improvisation ever recorded&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lenny Kaye saying it foreshadows &quot;where rock is likely to be in about five years&quot;. In his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1970 critics poll, Christgau ranked &quot;Live/Dead&quot; as the third best popular music album.

In retrospect, AllMusic notes that &quot;few recordings have ever represented the essence of an artist in performance as faithfully as &quot;Live/Dead&quot;&quot;, while Grateful Dead scholar Blair Jackson regards it as the best psychedelic rock album of the 1960s. Engineer and author Michael Hageloh claims that with the album, the Dead &quot;spontaneously create[d] the form now known as &#x27;jam rock and became &quot;legends with a generation-spanning cult following&quot;. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann comments &quot;It was our first live release and it remains one of our best-loved albums. Its appeal was that it took great &#x27;you-had-to-be-there&#x27; live versions of songs like &#x27;Dark Star&#x27; and &#x27;The Eleven&#x27; and put them right in people’s living rooms.&quot;

In 2003, the album was ranked number 244 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 247 in a 2012 revised list. It was voted number 242 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

<doc id="221525" wikidata="Q1952404" url="?curid=221525" title="Multilinear map">
<text>In linear algebra, a multilinear map is a function of several variables that is linear separately in each variable. More precisely, a multilinear map is a function

:formula_1

where formula_2 (formula_3) and formula_4 are vector spaces (or modules over a commutative ring), with the following property: for each formula_5, if all of the variables but formula_6 are held constant, then formula_7 is a linear function of formula_6. One way to visualize this is to imagine two orthogonal vectors; if one of these vectors is scaled by a factor of 2 while the other remains unchanged, the cross product likewise scales by a factor of two. If both are scaled by a factor of 2, the cross product scales by a factor of formula_9.

A multilinear map of one variable is a linear map, and of two variables is a bilinear map. More generally, for any nonnegative integer formula_10, a multilinear map of &quot;k&quot; variables is called a &quot;k&quot;-linear map. If the codomain of a multilinear map is the field of scalars, it is called a multilinear form. Multilinear maps and multilinear forms are fundamental objects of study in multilinear algebra.

If all variables belong to the same space, one can consider symmetric, antisymmetric and alternating &quot;k&quot;-linear maps. The latter two coincide if the underlying ring (or field) has a characteristic different from two, else the former two coincide.

==Examples==
* Any bilinear map is a multilinear map. For example, any inner product on a formula_11-vector space is a multilinear map, as is the cross product of vectors in formula_12.
* The determinant of a matrix is an alternating multilinear function of the columns (or rows) of a square matrix.
* If formula_13 is a &quot;Ck&quot; function, then the formula_10th derivative of formula_15 at each point formula_16 in its domain can be viewed as a symmetric formula_10-linear function formula_18.

==Coordinate representation==
Let

:formula_1

be a multilinear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces, where formula_20 has dimension formula_21, and formula_22 has dimension formula_23. If we choose a basis formula_24 for each formula_20 and a basis formula_26 for formula_22 (using bold for vectors), then we can define a collection of scalars formula_28 by

:formula_29

Then the scalars formula_30 completely determine the multilinear function formula_31. In particular, if

:formula_32

for formula_33, then

:formula_34

==Example==
Let&#x27;s take a trilinear function

:formula_35
where , and .

A basis for each is formula_36 Let

:formula_37
where formula_38. In other words, the constant formula_39 is a function value at one of the eight possible triples of basis vectors (since there are two choices for each of the three formula_40), namely: 
:formula_41

Each vector formula_42 can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors

:formula_43

The function value at an arbitrary collection of three vectors formula_44 can be expressed as
:formula_45
or in expanded form as
:formula_46

==Relation to tensor products==
There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between multilinear maps

:formula_1

and linear maps

:formula_48

where formula_49 denotes the tensor product of formula_2. The relation between the functions formula_51 and formula_15 is given by the formula

:formula_53

==Multilinear functions on &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrices==
One can consider multilinear functions, on an matrix over a commutative ring with identity, as a function of the rows (or equivalently the columns) of the matrix. Let be such a matrix and , be the rows of . Then the multilinear function can be written as

:formula_54

satisfying

:formula_55

If we let formula_56 represent the th row of the identity matrix, we can express each row as the sum

:formula_57

Using the multilinearity of we rewrite as

:formula_58

Continuing this substitution for each we get, for ,

:formula_59

Therefore, is uniquely determined by how operates on formula_60.

==Example==
In the case of 2×2 matrices, we get

:formula_61

where formula_62 and formula_63. If we restrict formula_64 to be an alternating function, then formula_65 and formula_66. Letting formula_67, we get the determinant function on 2×2 matrices:

:formula_68

==Properties==
* A multilinear map has a value of zero whenever one of its arguments is zero.

<doc id="221530" wikidata="Q1179446" url="?curid=221530" title="De Rham cohomology">
<text>In mathematics, de Rham cohomology (named after Georges de Rham) is a tool belonging both to algebraic topology and to differential topology, capable of expressing basic topological information about smooth manifolds in a form particularly adapted to computation and the concrete representation of cohomology classes. It is a cohomology theory based on the existence of differential forms with prescribed properties.

On any smooth manifold, every exact form is closed, but the converse may fail to hold. Roughly speaking, this failure is related to the possible existence of &quot;holes&quot; in the manifold, and the de Rham cohomology groups comprise a set of topological invariants of smooth manifolds that precisely quantify this relationship.

==Definition==
The de Rham complex is the cochain complex of differential forms on some smooth manifold , with the exterior derivative as the differential:

:formula_1

where is the space of smooth functions on , is the space of -forms, and so forth. Forms that are the image of other forms under the exterior derivative, plus the constant function in , are called exact and forms whose exterior derivative is are called closed (see &quot;Closed and exact differential forms&quot;); the relationship then says that exact forms are closed.

In contrast, closed forms are not necessarily exact. An illustrative case is a circle as a manifold, and the -form corresponding to the derivative of angle from a reference point at its centre, typically written as (described at &quot;Closed and exact differential forms&quot;). There is no function defined on the whole circle such that is its derivative; the increase of in going once around the circle in the positive direction implies a multivalued function . Removing one point of the circle obviates this, at the same time changing the topology of the manifold. 

One prominent example when all closed forms are exact is when the underlying space is contractible to a point or, more generally, if it is simply connected (no-holes condition). In this case the exterior derivative formula_2 restricted to closed forms has a local inverse called a homotopy operator. Since it is also nilpotent, it forms a dual chain complex with the arrows reversed compared to the de Rham complex. This is the situation described in the Poincaré lemma. 

The idea behind de Rham cohomology is to define equivalence classes of closed forms on a manifold. One classifies two closed forms as cohomologous if they differ by an exact form, that is, if is exact. This classification induces an equivalence relation on the space of closed forms in . One then defines the -th de Rham cohomology group formula_3 to be the set of equivalence classes, that is, the set of closed forms in modulo the exact forms.

Note that, for any manifold composed of disconnected components, each of which is connected, we have that

:formula_4

This follows from the fact that any smooth function on with zero derivative everywhere is separately constant on each of the connected components of .

==De Rham cohomology computed==
One may often find the general de Rham cohomologies of a manifold using the above fact about the zero cohomology and a Mayer–Vietoris sequence. Another useful fact is that the de Rham cohomology is a homotopy invariant. While the computation is not given, the following are the computed de Rham cohomologies for some common topological objects:

===The -sphere===
For the -sphere, formula_5, and also when taken together with a product of open intervals, we have the following. Let , and be an open real interval. Then

:formula_6

===The -torus===
The formula_7-torus is the Cartesian product: formula_8. Similarly, allowing formula_9 here, we obtain

:formula_10

We can also find explicit generators for the de Rham cohomology of the torus directly using differential forms. Given a quotient manifold formula_11 and a differential form formula_12 we can say that formula_13 is formula_14-invariant if given any diffeomorphism induced by formula_14, formula_16 we have formula_17. In particular, the pullback of any form on formula_18 is formula_14-invariant. Also, the pullback is an injective morphism. In our case of formula_20 the differential forms formula_21 are formula_22-invariant since formula_23. But, notice that formula_24 for formula_25 is not an invariant formula_26-form. This with injectivity implies that

:formula_27

Since the cohomology ring of a torus is generated by formula_28, taking the exterior products of these forms gives all of the explicit representatives for the de Rham cohomology of a torus.

===Punctured Euclidean space===
Punctured Euclidean space is simply formula_29 with the origin removed.

:formula_30

===The Möbius strip===
We may deduce from the fact that the Möbius strip, , can be deformation retracted to the -sphere (i.e. the real unit circle), that:

:formula_31

==De Rham theorem==

Stokes&#x27; theorem is an expression of duality between de Rham cohomology and the homology of chains. It says that the pairing of differential forms and chains, via integration, gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology formula_3 to singular cohomology groups formula_33 de Rham&#x27;s theorem, proved by Georges de Rham in 1931, states that for a smooth manifold , this map is in fact an isomorphism.

More precisely, consider the map

:formula_34

defined as follows: for any formula_35, let be the element of formula_36 that acts as follows:

:formula_37

The theorem of de Rham asserts that this is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology.

The exterior product endows the direct sum of these groups with a ring structure. A further result of the theorem is that the two cohomology rings are isomorphic (as graded rings), where the analogous product on singular cohomology is the cup product.

==Sheaf-theoretic de Rham isomorphism==
For any smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, let formula_38 be the constant sheaf on &quot;M&quot; associated to the abelian group formula_39; in other words, formula_38 is the sheaf of locally constant real-valued functions on &quot;M.&quot; Then we have a natural isomorphism

:formula_41

between the de Rham cohomology and the sheaf cohomology of formula_38. (Note that this shows that de Rham cohomology may also be computed in terms of Čech cohomology; indeed, since every smooth manifold is paracompact Hausdorff we have that sheaf cohomology is isomorphic to the Čech cohomology formula_43 for any good cover formula_44 of &quot;M&quot;.)

===Proof===
The standard proof proceeds by showing that the de Rham complex, when viewed as a complex of sheaves, is an acyclic resolution of formula_38. In more detail, let &quot;m&quot; be the dimension of &quot;M&quot; and let formula_46 denote the sheaf of germs of formula_47-forms on &quot;M&quot; (with formula_48 the sheaf of formula_49 functions on &quot;M&quot;). By the Poincaré lemma, the following sequence of sheaves is exact (in the abelian category of sheaves):

:formula_50

This long exact sequence now breaks up into short exact sequences of sheaves

:formula_51

where by exactness we have isomorphisms formula_52 for all &quot;k&quot;. Each of these induces a long exact sequence in cohomology. Since the sheaf formula_48 of formula_49 functions on &quot;M&quot; admits partitions of unity, any formula_48-module is a fine sheaf; in particular, the sheaves formula_46 are all fine. Therefore, the sheaf cohomology groups formula_57 vanish for formula_58 since all fine sheaves on paracompact spaces are acyclic. So the long exact cohomology sequences themselves ultimately separate into a chain of isomorphisms. At one end of the chain is the sheaf cohomology of formula_38 and at the other lies the de Rham cohomology.

==Related ideas==
The de Rham cohomology has inspired many mathematical ideas, including Dolbeault cohomology, Hodge theory, and the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. However, even in more classical contexts, the theorem has inspired a number of developments. Firstly, the Hodge theory proves that there is an isomorphism between the cohomology consisting of harmonic forms and the de Rham cohomology consisting of closed forms modulo exact forms. This relies on an appropriate definition of harmonic forms and of the Hodge theorem. For further details see Hodge theory.

===Harmonic forms===

If is a compact Riemannian manifold, then each equivalence class in formula_60 contains exactly one harmonic form. That is, every member formula_13 of a given equivalence class of closed forms can be written as

:formula_62

where formula_63 is exact and formula_64 is harmonic: formula_65.

Any harmonic function on a compact connected Riemannian manifold is a constant. Thus, this particular representative element can be understood to be an extremum (a minimum) of all cohomologously equivalent forms on the manifold. For example, on a -torus, one may envision a constant -form as one where all of the &quot;hair&quot; is combed neatly in the same direction (and all of the &quot;hair&quot; having the same length). In this case, there are two cohomologically distinct combings; all of the others are linear combinations. In particular, this implies that the 1st Betti number of a -torus is two. More generally, on an formula_7-dimensional torus formula_67, one can consider the various combings of formula_68-forms on the torus. There are formula_7 choose formula_68 such combings that can be used to form the basis vectors for formula_71; the formula_68-th Betti number for the de Rham cohomology group for the formula_7-torus is thus formula_7 choose formula_68.

More precisely, for a differential manifold , one may equip it with some auxiliary Riemannian metric. Then the Laplacian formula_76 is defined by

:formula_77
with formula_2 the exterior derivative and formula_79 the codifferential. The Laplacian is a homogeneous (in grading) linear differential operator acting upon the exterior algebra of differential forms: we can look at its action on each component of degree formula_68 separately.

If formula_81 is compact and oriented, the dimension of the kernel of the Laplacian acting upon the space of -forms is then equal (by Hodge theory) to that of the de Rham cohomology group in degree formula_68: the Laplacian picks out a unique harmonic form in each cohomology class of closed forms. In particular, the space of all harmonic formula_68-forms on formula_81 is isomorphic to formula_33 The dimension of each such space is finite, and is given by the formula_68-th Betti number.

===Hodge decomposition===
Let formula_81 be a compact oriented Riemannian manifold. The &quot;Hodge decomposition&quot; states that any formula_68-form on formula_81 uniquely splits into the sum of three components:

:formula_90

where formula_63 is exact, formula_92 is co-exact, and formula_64 is harmonic.

One says that a form formula_92 is co-closed if formula_95 and co-exact if formula_96 for some form formula_97, and that formula_64 is harmonic if the Laplacian is zero, formula_65. This follows by noting that exact and co-exact forms are orthogonal; the orthogonal complement then consists of forms that are both closed and co-closed: that is, of harmonic forms. Here, orthogonality is defined with respect to the inner product on formula_100:

:formula_101

By use of Sobolev spaces or distributions, the decomposition can be extended for example to a complete (oriented or not) Riemannian manifold.

<text>Pilottown (or Pilot Town) is an unincorporated community and ghost town in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States.
It serves as a base for river pilots to guide ships across the bar and up and down the Mississippi River. As of 2020, there are no permanent residents of the community.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the French settlement and fort that preceded Pilottown near the mouth of the Mississippi was known as La Balize, a name that meant &quot;seamark&quot; in French. La Balize was located about downriver from Pilottown.

==History==

Pilottown was constructed and settled after September 1860 in its current location. It replaced the earlier village of La Balize, that had been founded more than 160 years earlier downriver. After the hurricane of September 14–15, 1860, blew its buildings down and destroyed the area in a storm surge, La Balize was finally abandoned. The main river passage was moved to the Southwest Pass, because of its deeper water. The Mississippi River pilots built their new settlement upriver above Head of Passes. They named it Pilottown.

The first French settlers had built a crude fort and dwellings for La Balize near the mouth of the Mississippi in 1699. The name meant &quot;seamark&quot;, and the French built a 62-foot-high (19 m) wooden pyramidal structure in 1721 to help guide ships on the Mississippi River and at its shifting delta. This was where river pilots came to live.

Pilottown is built on piers in swampy ground on the East Bank of the lower Mississippi River, about downriver from New Orleans () and about south of Venice, Louisiana. Pilottown is located a few miles above Head of Passes, the point considered to be the mouth of the Mississippi River. Below there the River splits into multiple branches. This is part of the active delta front that has, over time, built up the larger Mississippi River Delta.

Pilottown serves as a temporary home for members of the Crescent River Port Pilots&#x27; Association and as a base for oil exploration. Although the captain is always responsible for his ship, all oceangoing ships must take a pilot on board when entering the Mississippi River system. The river has shifting passages and sand bars that make the journey difficult, especially given the tides and the powerful current downriver. The Associated Branch Pilots supplies river pilots for ships traveling between the Gulf of Mexico and Pilottown. The Crescent River Port Pilots&#x27; Association supplies river pilots between Pilottown and New Orleans, Louisiana, and the New Orleans-Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association supplies pilots for ships that are bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Pilottown consists of a few buildings, including temporary housing for river pilots and a weather station, and some large oil tanks. Because Pilottown is only a few feet above river level, a raised concrete walkway connects these buildings and runs the length of the island, to provide some footing in flood conditions.

Pilottown is accessible only by water or by helicopter. In the 19th and early 20th century many fishermen, pilots and their families lived here, but now most make their residence in larger communities upriver. The pilots stay in temporary quarters in Pilottown only while working. The peak population was probably reached in the 1860s, when La Balize had a population of some 800 people.

Pilottown no longer has any permanent residents; the remaining few in 2005 did not return after Hurricane Katrina. The Crescent River Port Pilots still maintain headquarters but pilots do not reside full-time. Pilottown is not listed in the United States census figures. Pilottown&#x27;s one-room school was closed in the 1970s. Although Pilottown still has its own zip code of 70081, the Pilottown Post Office was closed when the US Postal Service could not find a postmaster willing to live in the village.

===Hurricane Katrina===
Hurricane Katrina struck southern Louisiana near Pilottown, inflicting heavy damage on nearly every structure. The headquarters of the Associated Branch Pilots, located in Pilottown for over 100 years, was pushed backward off its foundation, leading the pilots to decide against rebuilding in Pilottown. They have since relocated 10 miles upriver to Venice. The Crescent River Port Pilots decided to remain in Pilottown to provide pilotage on their route which begins at Pilottown.

<doc id="221536" wikidata="Q1366301" url="?curid=221536" title="Right-hand rule">
<text>In mathematics and physics, the right-hand rule is a convention and a mnemonic, utilized to define the orientation of axes in three-dimensional space and to determine the direction of the cross product of two vectors, as well as to establish the direction of the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. 
The various right- and left-hand rules arise from the fact that the three axes of three-dimensional space have two possible orientations. This can be seen by holding your hands together with palms up and fingers curled. If the curl of the fingers represents a movement from the first or x-axis to the second or y-axis, then the third or z-axis can point along either right thumb or left thumb.

== History ==
The right-hand rule dates back to the 19th century when it was implemented as a way for identifying the positive direction of coordinate axes in three dimensions. William Rowan Hamilton, recognized for his development of quaternions, a mathematical system for representing three-dimensional rotations, is often attributed with the introduction of this convention. In the context of quaternions, the Hamiltonian product of two vector quaternions yields a quaternion comprising both scalar and vector components. Josiah Willard Gibbs recognized that treating these components separately, as dot and cross product, simplifies vector formalism. Following a substantial debate, the mainstream shifted from Hamilton&#x27;s quaternionic system to Gibbs&#x27; three-vectors system. This transition led to the prevalent adoption of the right-hand rule in the contemporary contexts. In specific, Gibbs outlines his intention for establishing a right-handed coordinate system in his pamphlet on vector analysis. In Article 11 of the pamphlet, Gibbs states &quot;The letters formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are appropriated to the designation of a &quot;normal system of unit vectors&quot;, i.e., three unit vectors, each of which is at right angles to the other two ... We shall always suppose that formula_3 is on the side of the formula_5 plane on which a rotation from formula_1 to formula_2 (through one right angle) appears counter-clockwise.&quot; While Gibbs did not use the term &quot;right-handed&quot; in his discussion, his instructions for defining the normal coordinate orientation are a clear statement of his intent for coordinates that follow the right-hand rule.
The cross product of vectors formula_8 and formula_9 is a vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by formula_8 and formula_9 with the direction given by the right-hand rule: If you put the index of your right hand on formula_8 and the middle finger on formula_9, then the thumb points in the direction of formula_14.

The right-hand rule in physics was introduced in the late 19th century by John Fleming in his book Magnets and Electric Currents. Fleming described the orientation of the induced electromotive force by referencing the motion of the conductor and the direction of the magnetic field in the following depiction: “If a conductor, represented by the middle finger, be moved in a field of magnetic flux, the direction of which is represented by the direction of the forefinger, the direction of this motion, being in the direction of the thumb, then the electromotive force set up in it will be indicated by the direction in which the middle finger points.&quot;

==Coordinates==
For right-handed coordinates, if the thumb of a person&#x27;s right hand points along the &quot;z&quot;-axis in the positive direction (third coordinate vector), then the fingers curl from the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis (first coordinate vector) toward the positive &quot;y&quot;-axis (second coordinate vector). When viewed at a position along the positive &quot;z&quot;-axis, the ¼ turn from the positive &quot;x-&quot; to the positive &quot;y-&quot;axis is counter-clockwise.

For left-handed coordinates, the above description of the axes is the same, except using the left hand; and the ¼ turn is clockwise.

Interchanging the labels of any two axes reverses the handedness. Reversing the direction of one axis (or three axes) also reverses the handedness. Reversing two axes amounts to a 180° rotation around the remaining axis, also preserving the handedness. These operations can be composed to give repeated changes of handedness. (If the axes do not have a positive or negative direction, then handedness has no meaning.)

==Rotations==
===A rotating body===
In mathematics, a rotating body is commonly represented by a pseudovector along the axis of rotation. The length of the vector gives the speed of rotation and the direction of the axis gives the direction of rotation according to the right-hand rule: right fingers curled in the direction of rotation and the right thumb pointing in the positive direction of the axis. This allows some simple calculations using the vector cross-product. No part of the body is moving in the direction of the axis arrow. If the thumb is pointing north, Earth rotates according to the right-hand rule (prograde motion). This causes the Sun, Moon, and stars to appear to revolve westward according to the left-hand rule.

===Helixes and screws===
A helix is a curved line formed by a point rotating around a center while the center moves up or down the &quot;z&quot;-axis. Helices are either right or left handed with curled fingers giving the direction of rotation and thumb giving the direction of advance along the &quot;z&quot;-axis.

The threads of a screw are helical and therefore screws can be right- or left-handed. To properly fasten or unfasten a screw, one applies the above rules: if a screw is right-handed, pointing one&#x27;s right thumb in the direction of the hole and turning in the direction of the right hand&#x27;s curled fingers (i.e. clockwise) will fasten the screw, while pointing away from the hole and turning in the new direction (i.e. counterclockwise) will unfasten the screw.

==Curve orientation and normal vectors==
In vector calculus, it is necessary to relate a normal vector of a surface to the boundary curve of the surface. Given a surface with a specified normal direction (a choice of &quot;upward direction&quot; with respect to ), the boundary curve around is defined to be &quot;positively oriented&quot; provided that the right thumb points in the direction of and the fingers curl along the orientation of the bounding curve .

==Electromagnetism==
*When electricity flows (with direction given by conventional current) in a long straight wire, it creates a cylindrical magnetic field around the wire according to the right-hand rule. The conventional direction of a magnetic line is given by a compass needle.
*Electromagnet: The magnetic field around a wire is relatively weak. If the wire is coiled into a helix, all the field lines inside the helix point in the same direction and each successive coil reinforces the others. The advance of the helix, the non-circular part of the current, and the field lines all point in the positive &quot;z&quot; direction. Since there is no magnetic monopole, the field lines exit the +&quot;z&quot; end, loop around outside the helix, and re-enter at the −&quot;z&quot; end. The +&quot;z&quot; end where the lines exit is defined as the north pole. If the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction of the circular component of the current, the right thumb points to the north pole.
*Lorentz force: If an electric charge moves across a magnetic field, it experiences a force according to the Lorentz force, with the direction given by the right-hand rule. If the index finger represents the direction of flow of charge (i.e. the current) and the middle finger represents the direction of the magnetic field in space, the direction of the force on the charge is represented by the thumb. Because the charge is moving, the force causes the particle path to bend. The bending force is computed by the vector cross-product. This means that the bending force increases with the velocity of the particle and the strength of the magnetic field. The force is maximum when the particle direction and magnetic fields are perpendicular, is less at any other angle, and is zero when the particle moves parallel to the field.

===Ampère&#x27;s right-hand grip rule===

Ampère&#x27;s right-hand grip rule, also called the &quot;right-hand screw rule&quot;, &quot;coffee-mug rule&quot; or the &quot;corkscrew-rule;&quot; is used either when a vector (such as the Euler vector) must be defined to represent the rotation of a body, a magnetic field, or a fluid, or vice versa, when it is necessary to define a rotation vector to understand how rotation occurs. It reveals a connection between the current and the magnetic field lines in the magnetic field that the current created. Ampère was inspired by fellow physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, who observed that needles swirled when in the proximity of an electric current-carrying wire and concluded that electricity could create magnetic fields.

===Application===
This rule is used in two different applications of Ampère&#x27;s circuital law:
# An electric current passes through a straight wire. When the thumb is pointed in the direction of conventional current (from positive to negative), the curled fingers will then point in the direction of the magnetic flux lines around the conductor. The direction of the magnetic field (counterclockwise rotation instead of clockwise rotation of coordinates when viewing the tip of the thumb) is a result of this convention and not an underlying physical phenomenon.
# An electric current passes through a solenoid, resulting in a magnetic field. When wrapping the right hand around the solenoid with the fingers in the direction of the conventional current, the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic north pole.

==Cross products==
The cross product of two vectors is often taken in physics and engineering. For example, as discussed above, the force exerted on a moving charged particle when moving in a magnetic field B is given by the magnetic term of Lorentz force:

:formula_15 (vector cross product)

The direction of the cross product may be found by application of the right-hand rule as follows: 
# The index finger points in the direction of the velocity vector v.
# The middle finger points in the direction of the magnetic field vector B.
# The thumb points in the direction of the cross product F.

For example, for a positively charged particle moving to the north, in a region where the magnetic field points west, the resultant force points up.

===Applications===
The right-hand rule has widespread use in physics. A list of physical quantities whose directions are related by the right-hand rule is given below. (Some of these are related only indirectly to cross products, and use the second form.)

* For a rotating object, if the right-hand fingers follow the curve of a point on the object, then the thumb points along the axis of rotation in the direction of the angular velocity vector.
* A torque, the force that causes it, and the position of the point of application of the force.
* A magnetic field, the position of the point where it is determined, and the electric current (or change in electric flux) that causes it.
* A magnetic field in a coil of wire and the electric current in the wire.
* The force of a magnetic field on a charged particle, the magnetic field itself, and the velocity of the object.
* The vorticity at any point in the field of the flow of a fluid
* The induced current from motion in a magnetic field (known as Fleming&#x27;s right-hand rule).
* The &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; unit vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system can be chosen to follow the right-hand rule. Right-handed coordinate systems are often used in rigid body and kinematics.

==Meta-mathematical issues==
Unlike most mathematical concepts, the meaning of a right-handed coordinate system cannot be expressed in terms of any mathematical axioms. Rather, the definition depends on chiral phenomena in the physical world, for example the culturally transmitted meaning of right and left hands, a majority human population with dominant right hand, or certain phenomena involving the weak force.
