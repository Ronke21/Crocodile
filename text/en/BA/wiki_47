<text>A spritzer () is a tall, chilled drink, usually made with white wine and carbonated water or sparkling mineral water. Fermented simple syrup can be used instead of white wine to keep it sweet but flavor neutral.

==Origin==
&quot;Spritzer&quot; is derived from the variant of the German language spoken in Austria, where the drink is very popular. It is used alongside the equally common form &quot;Gespritzter&quot; (mostly pronounced &quot;G&#x27;spritzter&quot;, a noun derived from the past participle of &quot;spritzen&quot;, i.e. squirt), a term also found in some German regions, such as Hessen (e.g. &quot;Süssgespritzter&quot;, i.e. a &quot;sweet spritzer&quot; using fizzy lemonade instead of soda water (&quot;Sauergespritzter&quot;)). In most of Germany, the word &quot;Schorle&quot; is used to denote a Spritzer.

==Alcoholic spritzers==
Alcoholic spritzers are increasingly available ready-mixed in cans; their relatively low alcohol and calorific content means they are often marketed to women.

In Hesse, &quot;gespritzt&quot; usually refers to a mixture of soda water or lemonade and &quot;Apfelwein&quot; (in Central Hessian dialect, &quot;Ebblwoi&quot;), an alcoholic drink from fermented apple juice somewhat similar to dry hard cider.
In Hungary spritzer, called &quot;fröccs&quot;, is very popular. There are dozens of different types of spritzer. They are distinguished by the proportion of wine and carbonated water or the type of other liquids added. Examples include:

* Kisfröccs or &quot;Fütty&quot; (&#x27;short spritzer&#x27; or &quot;whistle&quot;), made with 1dl of wine and 1dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Nagyfröccs (&#x27;full spritzer&#x27;), made with 2dl of wine and 1dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Hosszúlépés (&#x27;long step&#x27;), made with 1dl of wine and 2dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Házmester (&#x27;concierge&#x27;), made with 3dl of wine and 2dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Háziúr (&#x27;landlord spritzer&#x27;), made with 4dl of wine and 1dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Viceházmester (&#x27;vice concierge&#x27;), made with 2dl of wine and 3dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Sportfröccs (&#x27;sport spritzer&#x27;), made with 1dl of wine and 4dl of carbonated soda water; 
* Újházy fröccs (&#x27;Ujhazy spritzer&#x27;), made with 2dl of wine and a special pickle juice; and, 
* Macifröccs (&#x27;teddy bear spritzer&#x27;), made with red wine, soda and raspberry syrup;
* Krúdy-fröccs (Krúdy spritzer), made with 9dl of wine and 1dl of carbonated soda water.

Other variations include: &quot;șpriț de vară&quot; (or &quot;summer spritzer&quot;) in Romania (1 part white wine to 2 parts sparkling water), &quot;Brizganec&quot; or ‘’Špricar’’in Slovenia (wine and the popular domestic mineral water Radenska), &quot;špricer&quot; in Serbia (white wine or rosé, mixed with sparkling water, half of glass of each). In Croatia, a popular drink called &quot;gemišt&quot; is mixed with white wine and sparkling water to taste.

In north-eastern regions of Italy, especially Venice and surroundings, a &quot;spritz&quot; is a popular light cocktail, a mix of sparkling white wine (e.g., Prosecco), sparkling water, and Aperol or Bitter Campari. Spritzer in Italy is not so popular anymore and is called &quot;spritz bianco&quot; (&quot;white spritz&quot;).

==Non-alcoholic spritzer==
In the United States, some non-alcoholic carbonated juices are sold as &quot;spritzers&quot;. The same type of carbonated juice (actually made with juice and carbonated mineral water) is known in Germany as &quot;Saftschorle&quot; or &quot;Fruchtschorle&quot;. (Both short for rarely used &quot;Fruchtsaftschorle&quot;.) Particularly &quot;Apfelschorle&quot; (apple juice spritzer) is one of the most popular soft drinks in Germany. In Austria Apfelschorle is called &quot;Apfelsaft g&#x27;spritzt&quot;. &quot;... g&#x27;spritzt&quot; can be combined with every juice, e.g. Orangensaft g&#x27;spritzt or Pago/Cappy g&#x27;spritzt (producers of juices).

<text>In thermodynamics, the chemical potential of a species is the energy that can be absorbed or released due to a change of the particle number of the given species, e.g. in a chemical reaction or phase transition. The chemical potential of a species in a mixture is defined as the rate of change of free energy of a thermodynamic system with respect to the change in the number of atoms or molecules of the species that are added to the system. Thus, it is the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the amount of the species, all other species&#x27; concentrations in the mixture remaining constant. When both temperature and pressure are held constant, and the number of particles is expressed in moles, the chemical potential is the partial [[Molar concentration|molar]] [[Gibbs free energy]]. At chemical equilibrium or in phase equilibrium, the total sum of the product of chemical potentials and stoichiometric coefficients is zero, as the free energy is at a minimum. In a system in diffusion equilibrium, the chemical potential of any chemical species is uniformly the same everywhere throughout the system.

In semiconductor physics, the chemical potential of a system of electrons is known as the Fermi level.

==Overview==

Particles tend to move from higher chemical potential to lower chemical potential because this reduces the free energy. In this way, chemical potential is a generalization of &quot;potentials&quot; in physics such as gravitational potential. When a ball rolls down a hill, it is moving from a higher gravitational potential (higher internal energy thus higher potential for work) to a lower gravitational potential (lower internal energy). In the same way, as molecules move, react, dissolve, melt, etc., they will always tend naturally to go from a higher chemical potential to a lower one, changing the particle number, which is the conjugate variable to chemical potential.

A simple example is a system of dilute molecules diffusing in a homogeneous environment. In this system, the molecules tend to move from areas with high concentration to low concentration, until eventually, the concentration is the same everywhere. The microscopic explanation for this is based on kinetic theory and the random motion of molecules. However, it is simpler to describe the process in terms of chemical potentials: For a given temperature, a molecule has a higher chemical potential in a higher-concentration area and a lower chemical potential in a low concentration area. Movement of molecules from higher chemical potential to lower chemical potential is accompanied by a release of free energy. Therefore, it is a spontaneous process.

Another example, not based on concentration but on phase, is an ice cube on a plate above 0 °C. An H2O molecule that is in the solid phase (ice) has a higher chemical potential than a water molecule that is in the liquid phase (water) above 0 °C. When some of the ice melts, H2O molecules convert from solid to the warmer liquid where their chemical potential is lower, so the ice cube shrinks. At the temperature of the melting point, 0 °C, the chemical potentials in water and ice are the same; the ice cube neither grows nor shrinks, and the system is in equilibrium.

A third example is illustrated by the chemical reaction of dissociation of a weak acid HA (such as acetic acid, A = CH3COO−):
:HA H+ + A−
Vinegar contains acetic acid. When acid molecules dissociate, the concentration of the undissociated acid molecules (HA) decreases and the concentrations of the product ions (H+ and A−) increase. Thus the chemical potential of HA decreases and the sum of the chemical potentials of H+ and A− increases. When the sums of chemical potential of reactants and products are equal the system is at equilibrium and there is no tendency for the reaction to proceed in either the forward or backward direction. This explains why vinegar is acidic, because acetic acid dissociates to some extent, releasing hydrogen ions into the solution.

Chemical potentials are important in many aspects of multi-phase equilibrium chemistry, including melting, boiling, evaporation, solubility, osmosis, partition coefficient, liquid-liquid extraction and chromatography. In each case the chemical potential of a given species at equilibrium is the same in all phases of the system.

In electrochemistry, ions do &quot;not&quot; always tend to go from higher to lower chemical potential, but they &quot;do&quot; always go from higher to lower &quot;electrochemical potential&quot;. The electrochemical potential completely characterizes all of the influences on an ion&#x27;s motion, while the chemical potential includes everything &quot;except&quot; the electric force. (See below for more on this terminology.)

==Thermodynamic definition==
The chemical potential &quot;μ&quot;&quot;i&quot; of species &quot;i&quot; (atomic, molecular or nuclear) is defined, as all intensive quantities are, by the phenomenological fundamental equation of thermodynamics. This holds for both reversible and irreversible infinitesimal processes:

: formula_1

where d&quot;U&quot; is the infinitesimal change of internal energy &quot;U&quot;, d&quot;S&quot; the infinitesimal change of entropy &quot;S&quot;, d&quot;V&quot; is the infinitesimal change of volume &quot;V&quot; for a thermodynamic system in thermal equilibrium, and d&quot;N&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the infinitesimal change of particle number &quot;N&quot;&quot;i&quot; of species &quot;i&quot; as particles are added or subtracted. &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature, &quot;S&quot; is entropy, &quot;P&quot; is pressure, and &quot;V&quot; is volume. Other work terms, such as those involving electric, magnetic or gravitational fields may be added.

From the above equation, the chemical potential is given by

: formula_2

This is because the internal energy &quot;U&quot; is a state function, so if its differential exists, then the differential is an exact differential such as

: formula_3 

for independent variables &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ... , &quot;xN&quot; of &quot;U&quot;. 

This expression of the chemical potential as a partial derivative of &quot;U&quot; with respect to the corresponding species particle number is inconvenient for condensed-matter systems, such as chemical solutions, as it is hard to control the volume and entropy to be constant while particles are added. A more convenient expression may be obtained by making a Legendre transformation to another thermodynamic potential: the Gibbs free energy formula_4. From the differential formula_5 (for formula_6 and formula_7, the product rule is applied to) and using the above expression for formula_8, a differential relation for formula_9 is obtained:

: formula_10

As a consequence, another expression for formula_11 results:

: formula_12

and the change in Gibbs free energy of a system that is held at constant temperature and pressure is simply

: formula_13

In thermodynamic equilibrium, when the system concerned is at constant temperature and pressure but can exchange particles with its external environment, the Gibbs free energy is at its minimum for the system, that is formula_14. It follows that

: formula_15

Use of this equality provides the means to establish the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction.

By making further Legendre transformations from &quot;U&quot; to other thermodynamic potentials like the enthalpy formula_16 and Helmholtz free energy formula_17, expressions for the chemical potential may be obtained in terms of these:

: formula_18
: formula_19

These different forms for the chemical potential are all equivalent, meaning that they have the same physical content, and may be useful in different physical situations.

== Applications ==
The Gibbs–Duhem equation is useful because it relates individual chemical potentials. For example, in a binary mixture, at constant temperature and pressure, the chemical potentials of the two participants A and B are related by
: formula_20

where formula_21 is the number of moles of A and formula_22 is the number of moles of B. Every instance of phase or chemical equilibrium is characterized by a constant. For instance, the melting of ice is characterized by a temperature, known as the melting point at which solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium with each other. Chemical potentials can be used to explain the slopes of lines on a phase diagram by using the Clapeyron equation, which in turn can be derived from the Gibbs–Duhem equation. They are used to explain colligative properties such as melting-point depression by the application of pressure. Henry&#x27;s law for the solute can be derived from Raoult&#x27;s law for the solvent using chemical potentials.

==History==
Chemical potential was first described by the American engineer, chemist and mathematical physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs. He defined it as follows:

Gibbs later noted also that for the purposes of this definition, any chemical element or combination of elements in given proportions may be considered a substance, whether capable or not of existing by itself as a homogeneous body. This freedom to choose the boundary of the system allows the chemical potential to be applied to a huge range of systems. The term can be used in thermodynamics and physics for any system undergoing change. Chemical potential is also referred to as partial molar Gibbs energy (see also partial molar property). Chemical potential is measured in units of energy/particle or, equivalently, energy/mole.

In his 1873 paper &quot;A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces&quot;, Gibbs introduced the preliminary outline of the principles of his new equation able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact. By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e. bodies, being in composition part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional volume–entropy–internal energy graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium, i.e. &quot;necessarily stable&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, and &quot;unstable&quot;, and whether or not changes will ensue. In 1876, Gibbs built on this framework by introducing the concept of chemical potential so to take into account chemical reactions and states of bodies that are chemically different from each other. In his own words from the aforementioned paper, Gibbs states:
In this description, as used by Gibbs, &quot;ε&quot; refers to the internal energy of the body, &quot;η&quot; refers to the entropy of the body, and &quot;ν&quot; is the volume of the body.

==Electrochemical, internal, external, and total chemical potential==
The abstract definition of chemical potential given above—total change in free energy per extra mole of substance—is more specifically called total chemical potential. If two locations have different total chemical potentials for a species, some of it may be due to potentials associated with &quot;external&quot; force fields (electric potential energy, gravitational potential energy, etc.), while the rest would be due to &quot;internal&quot; factors (density, temperature, etc.) Therefore, the total chemical potential can be split into internal chemical potential and external chemical potential:
: formula_23
where
: formula_24
i.e., the external potential is the sum of electric potential, gravitational potential, etc. (where &quot;q&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are the charge and mass of the species, &quot;V&quot;ele and &quot;h&quot; are the electric potential and height of the container, respectively, and &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity). The internal chemical potential includes everything else besides the external potentials, such as density, temperature, and enthalpy. This formalism can be understood by assuming that the total energy of a system, formula_25, is the sum of two parts: an internal energy, formula_26, and an external energy due to the interaction of each particle with an external field, formula_27. The definition of chemical potential applied to formula_28 yields the above expression for formula_29.

The phrase &quot;chemical potential&quot; sometimes means &quot;total chemical potential&quot;, but that is not universal. In some fields, in particular electrochemistry, semiconductor physics, and solid-state physics, the term &quot;chemical potential&quot; means &quot;internal&quot; chemical potential, while the term electrochemical potential is used to mean &quot;total&quot; chemical potential.

==Systems of particles==

===Electrons in solids===

Electrons in solids have a chemical potential, defined the same way as the chemical potential of a chemical species: The change in free energy when electrons are added or removed from the system. In the case of electrons, the chemical potential is usually expressed in energy per particle rather than energy per mole, and the energy per particle is conventionally given in units of electronvolt (eV).

Chemical potential plays an especially important role in solid-state physics and is closely related to the concepts of work function, Fermi energy, and Fermi level. For example, n-type silicon has a higher internal chemical potential of electrons than p-type silicon. In a p–n junction diode at equilibrium the chemical potential (&quot;internal&quot; chemical potential) varies from the p-type to the n-type side, while the total chemical potential (electrochemical potential, or, Fermi level) is constant throughout the diode.

As described above, when describing chemical potential, one has to say &quot;relative to what&quot;. In the case of electrons in semiconductors, internal chemical potential is often specified relative to some convenient point in the band structure, e.g., to the bottom of the conduction band. It may also be specified &quot;relative to vacuum&quot;, to yield a quantity known as work function, however, work function varies from surface to surface even on a completely homogeneous material. Total chemical potential, on the other hand, is usually specified relative to electrical ground.

In atomic physics, the chemical potential of the electrons in an atom is sometimes said to be the negative of the atom&#x27;s electronegativity. Likewise, the process of chemical potential equalization is sometimes referred to as the process of electronegativity equalization. This connection comes from the Mulliken electronegativity scale. By inserting the energetic definitions of the ionization potential and electron affinity into the Mulliken electronegativity, it is seen that the Mulliken chemical potential is a finite difference approximation of the electronic energy with respect to the number of electrons, i.e.,
: formula_30

===Sub-nuclear particles===
In recent years, thermal physics has applied the definition of chemical potential to systems in particle physics and its associated processes. For example, in a quark–gluon plasma or other QCD matter, at every point in space there is a chemical potential for photons, a chemical potential for electrons, a chemical potential for baryon number, electric charge, and so forth.

In the case of photons, photons are bosons and can very easily and rapidly appear or disappear. Therefore, at thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potential of photons is in most physical situations always and everywhere zero. The reason is, if the chemical potential somewhere was higher than zero, photons would spontaneously disappear from that area until the chemical potential went back to zero; likewise, if the chemical potential somewhere was less than zero, photons would spontaneously appear until the chemical potential went back to zero. Since this process occurs extremely rapidly - at least, it occurs rapidly in the presence of dense charged matter or also in the walls of the textbook example for a photon gas of blackbody radiation - it is safe to assume that the photon chemical potential here is never different from zero. A physical situation where the chemical potential for photons can differ from zero are material-filled optical microcavities, with spacings between cavity mirrors in the wavelength regime. In such two-dimensional cases, photon gases with tuneable chemical potential, much reminiscent to gases of material particles, can be observed. 

Electric charge is different because it is intrinsically conserved, i.e. it can be neither created nor destroyed. It can, however, diffuse. The &quot;chemical potential of electric charge&quot; controls this diffusion: Electric charge, like anything else, will tend to diffuse from areas of higher chemical potential to areas of lower chemical potential. Other conserved quantities like baryon number are the same. In fact, each conserved quantity is associated with a chemical potential and a corresponding tendency to diffuse to equalize it out.

In the case of electrons, the behaviour depends on temperature and context. At low temperatures, with no positrons present, electrons cannot be created or destroyed. Therefore, there is an electron chemical potential that might vary in space, causing diffusion. At very high temperatures, however, electrons and positrons can spontaneously appear out of the vacuum (pair production), so the chemical potential of electrons by themselves becomes a less useful quantity than the chemical potential of the conserved quantities like (electrons minus positrons).

The chemical potentials of bosons and fermions is related to the number of particles and the temperature by Bose–Einstein statistics and Fermi–Dirac statistics respectively.

===Ideal vs. non-ideal solutions===

Generally the chemical potential is given as a sum of an ideal contribution and an excess contribution:
: formula_31

In an ideal solution, the chemical potential of species &quot;i&quot; (μ&quot;i&quot;) is dependent on temperature and pressure.

μ&quot;i&quot;0(&quot;T&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) is defined as the chemical potential of pure species &quot;i&quot;. Given this definition, the chemical potential of species &quot;i&quot; in an ideal solution is

: formula_32

where &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant, and formula_33 is the mole fraction of species &quot;i&quot; contained in the solution. The chemical potential becomes negative infinity when formula_34, but this does not lead to nonphysical results because formula_34 means that species &quot;i&quot; is not present in the system.

This equation assumes that formula_11 only depends on the mole fraction (formula_33) contained in the solution. This neglects intermolecular interaction between species &quot;i&quot; with itself and other species [&quot;i&quot;–(&quot;j&quot;≠&quot;i&quot;)]. This can be corrected for by factoring in the coefficient of activity of species &quot;i&quot;, defined as γ&quot;i&quot;. This correction yields

: formula_38

The plots above give a very rough picture of the ideal and non-ideal situation.

<text>Guillaume Delisle, also spelled Guillaume de l&#x27;Isle, or Guillelmo Delille (; 28 February 1675, Paris – 25 January 1726, Paris) was a French cartographer known for his popular and accurate maps of Europe and the newly explored Americas.

==Childhood and education==
Delisle was the son of Marie Malaine and Claude Delisle (1644–1720). His mother died after childbirth and his father married again, to Charlotte Millet de la Croyère. Delisle and his second wife had as many as 12 children, but many of them died at a young age. Although the senior Delisle had studied law, he also taught history and geography. He had an excellent reputation in Paris’ intellectual circles, and served as a tutor to lords . Among them was the duke Philippe d’Orléans, who later became regent for the crown of France, and collaborated with Nicolas Sanson, a well-known cartographer. Guillaume and two of his half-brothers, Joseph Nicolas and Louis, ended up pursuing similar careers in science.

While his father has to be given credit for educating Guillaume, the boy showed early signs of being an exceptional talent. He soon contributed to the family workshop, by drawing maps for his father&#x27;s historical works. Some have questioned the authorship of these first maps, saying that Delisle only copied what his father had done before him. In order to perfect his skills, Guillaume Delisle became the student of the astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini. Early on he produced high-quality maps, the first being his &quot;Carte de la Nouvelle-France et des Pays Voisins&quot; in 1696.

==Career==

At 27, Delisle was admitted into the French &quot;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot;, an institution financed by the French state. After that date, he signed his maps with the title of &quot;Géographe de l’Académie&quot;. Five years later, he moved to the &quot;Quai de l’Horloge&quot; in Paris, a true publishing hub where his business prospered. Delisle&#x27;s progress culminated in 1718 when he received the title of &quot;Premier Géographe du Roi&quot;. He was appointed to teach geography to the Dauphin, King Louis XIV’s son, a task for which he received a salary. Historian Mary Sponberg Pedley says, &quot;once authority was established, a geographer&#x27;s name might retain enough value to support two or three generations of mapmakers&quot;. In Delisle&#x27;s case, it could be said that his accomplishments surpassed his father&#x27;s. Up to that point, he had drawn maps not only of European countries, such as Italy, Spain, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, and regions such as the Duchy of Burgundy, but he had also contributed to the empire&#x27;s claims to recently explored continents of Africa and the Americas.

Like many cartographers of his day, Delisle did not travel with the explorers. He drew maps mostly in his office, relying on a variety of data. The quality of his maps depended on a solid network to provide him first-hand information. Given his family&#x27;s and his own reputation, Delisle had access to fairly recent accounts of travellers who were returning from the New World, which gave him an advantage over his competitors. Being a member of the &quot;Académie&quot;, he also kept current with recent discoveries, especially in astronomy and measurement. When he could not confirm the accuracy of a source, he would indicate it clearly on his maps. For instance, his &quot;Carte de la Louisiane&quot; shows a river that the baron of Lahontan claimed he discovered. As no one else could validate it, Delisle noted a warning to the viewer that it might not exist.

Delisle&#x27;s search for exactitude and intellectual honesty entangled him in a legal dispute in 1700 with Jean-Baptiste Nolin, a fellow cartographer. On March 8, 1700, De L&#x27;Isle accused Nolin (at first not naming him) of having copied proprietary cartographic information from a manuscript globe that he had made for Chancellor Boucherat, which resided in the cabinet of the latter&#x27;s son. This globe included information that De L&#x27;Isle had intentionally not put in print, such as the Sea of the West, because, according to De L&#x27;Isle himself, he did not want to make it available to France&#x27;s competition. De L’Isle wrote of the Sea of the West. Delisle took Nolin to court to prove his plagiarism. In the end, Delisle convinced the jury of scientists that Nolin knew only the old methods of cartography and must have stolen the information from Delisle&#x27;s own manuscript. Nolin&#x27;s maps were confiscated and he was forced to pay the court costs of the case. The high scientific quality of the work produced by the Delisle family contrasted with the workshop of Sanson. While Sanson knowingly published outdated facts and mistakes, Delisle worked to present up-to-date knowledge.

==Legacy==
After Guillaume Delisle&#x27;s death in 1726, his widow tried to preserve the workshop and protect the family. She appealed to the king with the help of the abbot Bignon, the king&#x27;s librarian and president of the academies. By that time, Guillaume&#x27;s brothers Joseph-Nicolas and Louis had already left France to serve Peter the Great in Russia. The youngest Delisle, Simon Claude, lacked practical knowledge in cartography; he asked for the king&#x27;s help in finding him an associate. The Delisle workshop was bequeathed to Philippe Buache.

Dutch cartographer Jan Barend Elwe reissued maps by Delisle in the late 18th century.

==Maps==

===Louisiana===

Delisle&#x27;s 1718 &quot;Carte de la Louisiane et du Cours du Mississippi&quot; is an example of French cartography at its height. It was widely circulated in Europe and remained in print for years, either copied exactly or used as a base map. As a result of its accurate representation of the lower Mississippi and the surrounding areas, Delisle&#x27;s map became a source map for all succeeding maps of the Mississippi River. It is particularly notable for its relatively accurate depiction of the Gulf area, as well as for its wealth of detail and information. The map is centered on the Mississippi River and the interior of what would later become the continental United States. It spans the area from the bottom of Lake Superior in the north to the point at which the Rio Grande meets the Gulf of Mexico in the south; the map also extends from the Atlantic coast, where numerous European settlements had been made, and westward to the Rocky Mountains.
The map is very detailed, including information on both known Indian territories (identified by tribes) and English colonies. The hundreds of labels on the map name lakes, rivers, colonies, cities, forts, mountains, and Indian tribes. It is ornamented with animals, ships, and cities, marked by small squares, circles, or rectangles with crosses on the top. These symbols are defined in the legend, which is located at the bottom of the map. It notes Indian habitations and includes an undulating line to mark the routes of Fernando de Soto and Louis de Moscoso in the area of the Mississippi where they were chased by Indian tribes. Next to the legend is a 16-point compass, placed in the center of the Gulf of Mexico. A &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; indicates the geographic north; the magnetic north is omitted from the compass, suggesting that the map was not created as for navigational purposes.

The map does not have much detail for the Carolina region, shown as extending into present-day Tennessee and Kentucky. For example, there is a flawed conception of the Appalachians as reaching into the Michigan peninsula, an error potentially borrowed from earlier maps by Morden Brown or Sanson. The largest area of the map by far was &quot;La Louisiane&quot;, or Louisiana. This was a France-centric version of the continent, intended to convey that the colony was firmly established colony by 1718. The colony consisted of between four hundred to seven hundred men, women, and children clustered around the mouth of the Mississippi. The map labeled major waterways and copper mines which could serve to boost the nation&#x27;s commerce. It was considered to be a politically charged document that also depicted explorers’ routes and controversial territorial claims in the New World.

The British and Spanish areas of the map appear small compared to those of the French, even though the French presence in the interior of the continent was minimal at the time. The map extended the territories under French control by pushing the British colonial border further east than the Appalachian frontier. The British were incensed to see the claim that the Province of Carolina was named for the French king, Charles IX, and not for England&#x27;s Charles II.

Because of the perceived territorial offenses against the British colonies on the map, there was a political controversy between England and France that lasted for at least fifteen years. The English Board of Trade filed several complaints. In 1720 a rival map was published and distributed by Englishman Herman Moll. Delisle&#x27;s map is part of the complex relationship between Europe and the Americas known as the Trans-Atlantic Exchange. Delisle extended the French territorial claims to the Rio Grande and Pecos River, causing outrage in turn in Spain. Spanish cartographers reacted by producing their own maps of their territories; this information had previously been protected as &quot;virtual state secrets.&quot; Months after Delisle&#x27;s map of Louisiana was published, Louis XV awarded him the unique title of &quot;premier geographe du roi&quot;, with a pension of 1200 &quot;livres&quot;.

The Delisle map of 1718 is significant as a major shift in cartographic authority in the Western cartographic tradition, from the classical Greek traditions to one based more strongly on science. Delisle based this and other maps on astrologically determined latitudes and longitudes, as well as on critical examinations of primary and secondary source material. In this way, this map is a precursor to the cartography of the later 18th century, which relied on science and expressed imperial ambitions.

===New France===
Delisle&#x27;s 1703 &quot;Carte du Canada ou de la Nouvelle France&quot; is praised as the first map to correctly depict the latitude and longitude of Canada. To accomplish this feat, Delisle – while never having personally visited the New World – devoted seven years to in-depth research. He made several earlier sketches drawn from information extracted from the &quot;Jesuit Relations&quot;, and personal relationships with many missionaries and explorers enhanced his ability to gain a rather extensive knowledge of the landscape. He also used calculations of the eclipse to find the precise longitude of Quebec which had, up until that point, only been guessed at. The research behind this map, in addition to its mathematical nature, made it a standard for maps to come. It had a large impact when it was published, underscoring the French strength in New France in the early 18th century, and it stood out as an early example of a more dispassionate, scientific type of map relative to the impressionistic ones of centuries before.

The map itself is quite detailed, covering such vast areas as New France, Greenland, Labrador, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, and the Great Lakes and Arctic regions. Delisle did not attempt to fill in areas of white space where his knowledge was insufficient, rather he let these spaces remain, a decision indicative of cartographical renewal in France in that period. In spite of these holes and the scientific nature of his map, Delisle&#x27;s 1703 &quot;Carte&quot; still contains a large amount of information from Indians and considerations on imperial influence. In at least one instance, Delisle employed information from Indians that was not necessarily confirmed by a European authority. For example, on the map, Lake Winnipeg – marked as &quot;Lac des Assenipoils&quot; – is shown with its water communication down to the Hudson Bay, information taken from an Indian report rather than one of European discovery. Furthermore, although hundreds of Indian tribes were identified in Delisle&#x27;s earlier sketches, he consolidated a number of related bands under one heading in his final map. In other instances, information about certain traditional grounds provided in earlier maps, such as those of the Mistassini Cree, was omitted in Delisle&#x27;s 1703 map either due to famine, disease, or collapse of hunting grounds.

The map provides a large cartouche in the upper left corner, which includes scenes from the New World implying imperial claims. The cartouche was done by the artist N. Guerard and carried the symbol of French royalty. Other parts of the cartouche included a Jesuit missionary performing a baptism of an Indian and a Recollects missionary guiding Indians toward the road to heaven. There is also the image of an Iroquois brandishing a scalp of a Frenchman, and Iroquois on a bed of thistles, a Huron holding rosary beads, and beaver. In this way, the map – which is otherwise relatively scientific – is not entirely depoliticized.

==Persia==
The map of Iran at the end of the Safavid period is depicted in 1724 (late Safavid dynasty). In French this is named Carte de Perse. Starting from the Sea of Azov and the Crimea from the West, it extends to Kashmir and Kabul in the east. In the north, the map goes to the highest point of the Caspian Sea and to the south the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. The name of Persian Gulf in the map is explicitly included as the Golfe Persique.

This map covers areas which today are countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Armenia, and the republic of Azerbaijan. The map also contains parts of today’s Russia, Pakistan, Turkey, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kurdistan, and the Arabian Peninsula. In the map Delisle has drawn mountains and connecting roads between cities.

<text>The American Law Institute (ALI) is a research and advocacy group of judges, lawyers, and legal scholars established in 1923 to promote the clarification and simplification of United States common law and its adaptation to changing social needs. Members of ALI include law professors, practicing attorneys, judges and other professionals in the legal industry. ALI writes documents known as &quot;treatises&quot;, which are summaries of generally state court common law (legal principles that come out of U.S. state court decisions, compare federal common law -- most common law in the U.S. is developed at the state level). Many courts and legislatures look to ALI&#x27;s treatises as authoritative reference material concerning many legal issues. However, some legal experts and the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, along with some conservative commentators, have voiced concern about ALI rewriting the law.

The ALI drafts, approves, and publishes &quot;Restatements of the Law&quot;, &quot;Principles of the Law&quot;, model acts, and other proposals for law reform. The ALI is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

At any time, ALI is engaged in up to 20 projects examining the law. Some current projects have been watched closely by the media, particularly the revision of the Model Penal Code Sexual Assault provisions.

==History==
The movement that led to ALI&#x27;s founding began in 1888. Law professor Henry Taylor Terry, then teaching in Japan, wrote that year to the American Bar Association (ABA) to recommend that it should solicit proposals for a &quot;complete scientific arrangement of the whole body” of the law, and in response, the ABA set up a special committee on classification of law. James DeWitt Andrews, chair of the committee from 1901 to 1908, then launched his own &quot;Corpus Juris&quot; project in 1910, and in 1913, founded the American Academy of Jurisprudence (AAJ) to build the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot; jointly with the ABA. Andrews and his supporters proposed that the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot; would be systematically compiled with the assistance of leading experts in each field of American law. They argued that the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot; would be more comprehensive, authoritative, and accurate than existing treatises and digests like the West American Digest System, and they regarded the lawyers who worked on such digests, such as West Publishing&#x27;s attorney-editors, as second- and third-rate mediocrities. However, Andrews ran into staunch resistance from the very legal academics whom he needed to rally behind him to make such a project possible, especially John Henry Wigmore, dean of Northwestern University School of Law. Separately from the legal practitioners at the ABA, the legal academics at the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) formed committees to study the creation of a &quot;national center for study of law and jurisprudence&quot; in 1915, and a &quot;juristic center&quot; in 1916. The ABA finally pulled the plug on the hapless Andrews in 1923, who was still trying to rally support for the AAJ and what he was now calling a &quot;Codex Library&quot;, and threw its support behind the AALS&#x27;s proposal for the founding of a &quot;juristic center&quot;, which evolved into ALI. What seems to have finally united the ABA and the AALS behind the foundation of ALI in 1923 was the shared perception that &quot;Andrews and his Academy of Jurisprudence should not be entrusted with the task of classifying and restating American law&quot;. 

The ALI was founded in 1923 on the initiative of William Draper Lewis, Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, following a study by a group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers who sought to address the uncertain and complex nature of early 20th century American law. According to the &quot;Committee on the Establishment of a Permanent Organization for the Improvement of the Law,&quot; part of the law&#x27;s uncertainty stemmed from the lack of agreement on fundamental principles of the common-law system, while the law&#x27;s complexity was attributed to the numerous variations within different jurisdictions. The committee recommended that a perpetual society be formed to improve the law and the administration of justice in a scholarly and scientific manner.

The organization was incorporated on February 23, 1923, at a meeting called by the committee in the auditorium of Memorial Continental Hall in Washington, D.C. According to ALI&#x27;s Certificate of Incorporation, its purpose is &quot;to promote the clarification and simplification of the law and its better adaptation to social needs, to secure the better administration of justice, and to encourage and carry on scholarly and scientific legal work&quot;.

==Publications==
The basic approach and format of all American Law Institute publications is similar:

* An expert in the field of law, usually a legal scholar, is designated as reporter. With the help of assistants, the reporter does the basic research and prepares material.
* An initial draft is submitted for suggestions and revisions to a small group of advisers—judges, lawyers, and law teachers—with special knowledge of the subject. In most projects, the draft is also reviewed by a group of ALI members with a particular interest in the topic.
* The revised draft is next submitted for additional analysis and consideration to the ALI Council, a body of some 70 prominent judges, practicing lawyers, and law teachers. The draft can then be referred either to the reporter and advisers for further review or to the general ALI membership.
* When approved by the council, the draft is presented as a tentative draft to an annual meeting of the entire membership for debate and discussion. The membership may approve the draft, subject to revisions, or refer it back to the reporter and advisers. A series of tentative drafts is produced in this way over a number of years.
* A proposed final draft consisting of all prior tentative drafts as modified by membership action may then be submitted to the council and the membership. When the project has been approved by both, an official text is published.

The final product thus reflects the review and criticism of experienced members of the bench, bar, and academia. The process may take many years, and it is not unusual for a single Restatement of the law project to take over twenty years to complete.

===&quot;Restatements of the Law&quot;===

Restatements are essentially codifications of case law, common law judge-made doctrines that develop gradually over time because of the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot;. Although Restatements are not binding authority in and of themselves, they are highly persuasive because they are formulated over several years with extensive input from law professors, practicing attorneys, and judges. They are meant to reflect the consensus of the American legal community as to what the law is (and in some areas, what it should become). All told, the Restatement of the Law is one of the most respected and well-used sources of secondary authority, covering nearly every area of common law.

Restatements are primarily addressed to courts and aim at clear formulations of common law and its statutory elements, and reflect the law as it presently stands or might appropriately be stated by a court. Although Restatements aspire toward the precision of statutory language, they are also intended to reflect the flexibility and capacity for development and growth of the common law. That is why they are phrased in the descriptive terms of a judge announcing the law to be applied in a given case rather than in the mandatory terms of a statute.

ALI recently completed the Fourth Restatement of U.S. Foreign Relations Law and the Principles of Election Administration.

===Principles of the law===
Beginning with the Principles of Corporate Governance (issued in 1994), the American Law Institute issued studies of areas of law thought to need reform. This type of analysis typically results in a publication that recommends changes in the law. Principles of the Law issued so far include volumes on Aggregate Litigation (2010), Family Dissolution (2002), Intellectual Property (2008), Software Contracts (2010), Transnational Civil Procedure (2006; cosponsored by UNIDROIT), and Transnational Insolvency: Cooperation Among the NAFTA Countries (2003). Work in the Principles of the Law series continues with projects covering Corporate Compliance, Data Privacy, Election Law, and Government Ethics.

=== Model acts ===
ALI has also produces model acts on topics ranging from air flight, criminal procedure, evidence, federal securities law, land development, pre-arraignment procedure, to property. Some of these projects were undertaken jointly with the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL).

The chief joint ALI-NCCUSL project is the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which the institute has been developing and revising with the National Conference since the 1940s. First published in 1952, the UCC is one of a number of uniform acts that have been promulgated in conjunction with efforts to harmonize the law of sales and other commercial transactions in all 50 states within the United States. The Uniform Commercial Code is generally viewed as one of the most important developments in American law, having been enacted (with local adaptations) in almost every jurisdiction.

The Model Penal Code (MPC) is another ALI statutory formulation that has been widely accepted throughout the United States. Adopted by the institute membership in 1962 after twelve years of drafting and development, the code&#x27;s purpose was to stimulate and assist legislatures in making an effort to update and standardize the penal law of the United States. Primary responsibility for criminal law lies with the individual states, and such national efforts work to produce similar laws in different jurisdictions. The standard they used to make a determination of what the penal code should be was one of &quot;contemporary reasoned judgment&quot;, meaning what a reasoned person at the time of the development of the MPC would judge the penal law to do. The chief reporter for this undertaking was Herbert Wechsler, who later became a director of the institute.

ALI recently completed the Sentencing revision, and is still working on the sexual assault and related offenses project that is re-examining Article 213 of the Model Penal Code.

==Membership==
Membership in the American Law Institute is limited to 3,000 elected members who are judges, lawyers, and legal scholars from different practice areas. Membership includes distinguished foreign judges, such as Lord Gill from Scotland.

===Governance===
The institute is governed by its council, a volunteer board of directors that oversees the management of ALI&#x27;s business and projects. Having no fewer than 42 and no more than 65 members, the council consists of lawyers, judges, and academics, and reflects a broad range of specialties and experiences.

<text>&#x27; (CJS&quot;&quot;&#x27;; Latin for &#x27;Second Body of the Law&#x27;) is an encyclopedia of United States law at the federal and state levels. It is arranged alphabetically, into over 430 topics, which in turn are arranged into subheadings. , &quot;CJS&quot; consisted of 164 bound volumes, five index volumes and 11 table of cases volumes.

&quot;CJS&quot; is named after the 6th century of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, the first codification of Roman law and civil law. The name literally means &#x27;body of the law&#x27;; denotes the second edition of the encyclopedia, which was originally issued as  by the American Law Book Company (from 1914 to 1937). &quot;CJS&quot; is published by West in print form and on Westlaw. The print edition is updated annually with pocket supplements and revised editions of bound volumes. Before Thomson&#x27;s acquisition of West, &quot;CJS&quot; competed against the &quot;American Jurisprudence&quot; legal encyclopedia.

While legal encyclopedias like &quot;CJS&quot; were at one time heavily used by the courts, the growth of statutory and regulatory governance has had the effect of eroding this reliance. As such, rather than being used as sources of authoritative statements of law, legal encyclopedias are now more often used as tools for finding relevant case law.

Volumes 82, 97, and 98 of appeared behind the closing credits of the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television series. Throughout the series, approximately twenty volumes can be seen on the shelf behind Mason&#x27;s desk.

<text>The Crystal Method is an American electronic music act formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, by Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland in 1993. They were pioneers of the big beat genre and their music has appeared in numerous TV shows, films, video games, and advertisements. Their 1997 debut studio album &quot;Vegas&quot; was certified platinum in 2007, and saw follow-ups &quot;Tweekend&quot;, &quot;Legion of Boom&quot;, &quot;Divided by Night&quot;, and &quot;The Crystal Method&quot;.

In 2017, Ken Jordan retired from music and left the group, with Scott Kirkland adopting The Crystal Method as a solo moniker.

==History==

The Crystal Method originally had two members, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland. Before The Crystal Method was formed, Jordan and Kirkland started working on music while working at a grocery store. Jordan was also a local DJ in Las Vegas as well as the college radio program director at UNLV. Jordan taught Kirkland how to DJ, and when Jordan moved to Los Angeles to work for a producer, Kirkland took over his job DJing at the local club. Kirkland also moved out to Los Angeles, and they formed The Crystal Method in 1993.

While working as a production duo for a rapper, a person named Crystal would handle transportation needs. The rapper repeatedly referred to her method of transportation as &quot;The Crystal Method.&quot; The pair adopted the name based on the layout of the three words and the sound of the name.

===Early days (1993–1995)===
By the early 1990s, both Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland had moved from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Jordan and Kirkland rented a house together, in La Crescenta, Glendale, California, which had a small underground shelter beneath the front lawn. Originally intending to turn the shelter into a studio, it proved to be an unrealistic idea and the duo set up a studio in their house which was located near a 210 Freeway overpass. They subsequently named their studio The Bomb Shelter. They were interviewed on the front lawn of the house in the documentary &quot;Better Living Through Circuitry&quot;.

After The Bomb Shelter was built, a tape of The Crystal Method&#x27;s music found its way to British DJ Justin King. King was interested in starting a record label that would showcase American electronic dance acts. Together with Steve Melrose, King formed the record label City of Angels Record Label. The first official release from the City of Angels label was The Crystal Method&#x27;s &quot;Now is the Time&quot;. The Crystal Method were signed to Outpost Recordings in 1996.

===&quot;Vegas&quot; (1996–1998)===
After the band signed with Outpost, they began working on their debut album. The group&#x27;s final single on the City of Angels Record Label was &quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot;. Their next single was &quot;Come2gether&quot;, from the &quot;Mortal Kombat: More Kombat&quot; soundtrack.

On August 26, 1997, The Crystal Method released their debut studio album, &quot;Vegas&quot;. &quot;Vegas&quot; peaked at number 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 1998, then platinum in 2007.

The album&#x27;s release was supported by its four singles (&quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot;, &quot;Trip Like I Do&quot;, &quot;Busy Child&quot;, and &quot;Comin&#x27; Back&quot;) and by the inclusion of eight of its tracks on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;N2O&quot;. The game&#x27;s publisher, Fox Interactive, sponsored The Crystal Method&#x27;s 1998 tour. Jordan said that in live performances, &quot;We definitely go for intensity. We&#x27;re not interested in making our shows look like reality. We&#x27;re interested in making the most intense and dynamic experience you&#x27;ve ever been through.&quot;

A reworking of &quot;Trip Like I Do&quot;, called &quot;(Can&#x27;t You) Trip Like I Do&quot;, was also included as a collaborative effort with Filter on soundtrack to the film adaptation of &quot;Spawn&quot; in 1997 and on the soundtrack of Michael Benveniste&#x27;s &quot;Tedd Can&quot; chronicles.

===&quot;Tweekend&quot; (1999–2002)===
In 1999, the band recorded their second studio album, &quot;Tweekend&quot;, which featured more guest artists than &quot;Vegas&quot;. The album was released in July 2001, and peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, which remains the group&#x27;s highest album chart position to date.

Featured guests from the album include Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland, and others, like Doug Grean, DJ Swamp, Ryan &quot;Ryu&quot; Maginn, and Julie Gallios. Four singles were released from &quot;Tweekend&quot;: &quot;Wild, Sweet and Cool&quot;, &quot;Murder&quot;, &quot;Blowout&quot;, &quot;Name of the Game&quot;.

Jordan and Kirkland formerly ran a radio show called &quot;Community Service&quot; which aired Friday nights on radio station Indie 103.1, in California. They played music and hosted guests including Death in Vegas and Unkle.

A year after the release of &quot;Tweekend&quot;, The Crystal Method released a continuous mix album based on their radio show, titled &quot;Community Service&quot;. The album does not feature any new studio material from The Crystal Method, but is composed of remixes of bands like P.O.D., Rage Against the Machine, and Garbage, plus remixes of songs from &quot;Tweekend&quot;. Their remix of P.O.D.&#x27;s &quot;Boom&quot; from this album, also appeared in the video game &quot;Amplitude&quot;.

&quot;Community Service&quot; peaked at number 160 on the Billboard 200, number five on the Top Electronic Albums chart, and number 15 on the Top Independent Albums chart.

===&quot;Legion of Boom&quot; (2003–2005)===

After the release of &quot;Community Service&quot;, The Crystal Method went back into the studio to record their third album, &quot;Legion of Boom&quot;. During the recording, they used the house as their recording studio instead of The Bomb Shelter.

In December 2003, the single &quot;Born Too Slow&quot;, with vocals from John Garcia and guitar by Wes Borland was released. &quot;Legion of Boom&quot; was released on January 13, 2004, and peaked at number 36 on the Billboard 200. It sold over 25,000 copies in its first week. The track was also part of the soundtrack of the 2003 video game &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;, used prominently in its demo.

The other single released from &quot;Legion of Boom&quot;, &quot;Starting Over&quot;, featured vocals from Rahzel. No other singles were released but other songs, including &quot;Weapons of Mass Distortion&quot;, &quot;Bound Too Long&quot; and &quot;Realizer&quot;, appeared in various movies and TV shows. &quot;I Know It&#x27;s You&quot; appeared in the trailer for the film &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, and includes vocals from Milla Jovovich.

In 2005, the album was nominated for the Best Electronic/Dance Album Grammy, the first year that category existed. It lost to &quot;Kish Kash&quot; by Basement Jaxx.

Around this time, Jordan and Kirkland formed their own record label, called Tiny E Records. Also in 2005, Jordan and Kirkland composed an original theme for the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;, which remained in use for seven seasons before Jordan and Kirkland remixed the theme which has been in use since the beginning of season 8.

In 2004, The Crystal Method collaborated with Alan Parsons, on his fourth solo album since the demise of the Alan Parsons Project, &quot;A Valid Path&quot;, on the song &quot;We Play The Game&quot;.

On April 5, 2005, The Crystal Method released their sequel to &quot;Community Service&quot;, titled &quot;Community Service II&quot;, another continuous mix of electronica songs and remixes of music by artists including The Doors, Unkle, New Order and Smashing Pumpkins. The album peaked at number 31 on the Top Independent Albums chart and number 8 on the Top Electronic albums chart.

A 5 track EP, &quot;Community Service II Exclusives&quot;, was released through the iTunes Store. It included one new track, &quot;Badass&quot;, and full versions of four tracks from &quot;Community Service II&quot;. It was removed from the iTunes store not long after it was released.

===&quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;London&quot;, and &quot;Vegas&quot; re-release (2006–2008)===

The group composed and performed the score for the film &quot;London&quot;, which was released in February 2006. The soundtrack album included excerpts from the score, two Crystal Method vocal tracks—&quot;Smoked&quot; and &quot;Glass Breaker&quot;, which were also released as a single—and songs by artists like Evil Nine, The Out Crowd, and The Perishers.

Shortly after the release of the &quot;London&quot; soundtrack, The Crystal Method was approached by Nike to take part in a series of music releases specifically designed to be listened to while running. The group&#x27;s contribution, &quot;&quot;—the first in the series—was initially released digitally, in June 2006, with the physical release following a year later. &quot;Drive&quot; peaked at number 23 on the Top Electronic Albums chart. The album, a 45-minute continuous mix, starts off slow, increases in tempo, and slows at the end, following the arc of a typical distance run. In 2006 the track &quot;Robogirl&quot; released by the duo appeared on &quot;Dance Dance Revolution: SuperNOVA&quot;.

In 2007, ten years after its original release, the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Vegas&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA. One month later, a special edition of the album was released, with a second disc including remixes and video.

In late 2008, the group remixed their song &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;. Where the original version featured samples of Jesse Jackson, this &quot;Vote &#x27;08 Remix&quot; used samples of Barack Obama, marking the presidential election.

===&quot;Divided by Night&quot; (2009–2012)===

Following the release of &quot;Legion of Boom&quot;, The Crystal Method began construction of a new, full-sized recording studio in Los Angeles—Crystalwerks. When it was finished, they began work on their fourth studio album, &quot;Divided by Night&quot;.

On April 14, 2009, The Crystal Method released the digital single &quot;Drown in the Now&quot;. A second single, &quot;Black Rainbows&quot;, was released via Beatport two weeks later.

The &quot;Divided by Night&quot; tour started in Boston on May 6, and the album was released the following week. It peaked at number 38 on the Billboard 200, number two on the Top Electronic Albums chart, and number four on the Top Independent Albums chart, and also granted the duo another Grammy nomination. The album features guest artists including LMFAO, Peter Hook (of New Order), Matisyahu, Meiko, Justin Warfield, Emily Haines (of Metric), and Jason Lytle.

&quot;X Games 3D: The Movie&quot;, released in August 2009, included a number of Crystal Method songs and remixes, including &quot;Drown in the Now&quot; and &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;.

===&quot;The Crystal Method&quot; and Ken Jordan&#x27;s departure (2013–2017)===
Originally scheduled for a June, 2013, release, their eponymous fifth studio album &quot;The Crystal Method&quot; was delayed by a surgery to remove a cyst in Scott Kirkland&#x27;s brain. The album was released on January 14, 2014.

When approximately halfway creating the next album process, Scott Kirkland received news that he had developed &quot;what&#x27;s called a benign posterior fossa arachnoid cyst that needed to be removed from my head.&quot; He explains, &quot;It&#x27;s a simple procedure as far as brain surgery goes, but they still had to cut into my skull and noodle around in there. The surgery wasn&#x27;t as bad as the infection afterwards, which landed me in the ICU for ten days. Thankfully, I made it out okay. In hindsight, as weird as it sounds, I think we were able to make a better record because we came through this.&quot; Following his 2013 recovery, Scott regrouped with Ken Jordan and continued working on the album.

In late 2013, the duo were asked to compose the score and opening theme of &quot;Almost Human&quot;, a science fiction crime drama airing on Fox. The same year, two of the Crystal Method&#x27;s songs, &quot;Play for Real&quot; and &quot;Over It&quot;, were featured in the 2013 racing game &quot;Asphalt 8: Airborne&quot;.

In 2014, TCM&#x27;s song &quot;Single Barrel (Sling the Decks)&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Lucy&quot;.

In early 2017, Ken Jordan decided to retire from music, and left The Crystal Method; however, Scott Kirkland continues to produce and play shows under the moniker as a solo project.

In 2017, Scott as The Crystal Method went on tour with Tool, and collaborated with Tool bass player Justin Chancellor on a side project called Bandwidth.

===&quot;The Trip Home&quot; (2018)===
On July 17, 2018, Scott Kirkland announced the next Crystal Method album was titled &quot;The Trip Home&quot; and would be released on September 28, 2018. Kirkland also announced the first single, &quot;Holy Arp&quot;, would be released on July 27, 2018.

On July 20, 2018, Kirkland announced a North American tour to support the new album.

On September 7, 2018, Kirkland announced the second single &quot;There&#x27;s a Difference&quot; featuring Franky Perez, which released the same day.

On November 26, 2018, Kirkland and Jean-Michel Jarre announced that they would be collaborating on a track on Jean-Michel Jarre&#x27;s next electronica album.

=== &quot;The Trip Out&quot; (2022) ===
On February 18, 2022, The Crystal Method announced a follow-up album to &quot;The Trip Home&quot; titled &quot;The Trip Out&quot; while simultaneously releasing their first single &quot;Post Punk&quot; featuring DJ Hyper and Iggy Pop. 

The second single &quot;Watch Me Now&quot; featuring Koda &amp; VAAAL debuted April 11th, live on NBC&#x27;s &quot;American Song Contest&quot;, and would later go on to be featured in the soundtrack for &quot;MLB The Show 23&quot;. The album was released on Ultra Records on April 15, 2022.

<text>Dušan Makavejev (, ; 13 October 1932 – 25 January 2019) was a Serbian film director and screenwriter. He is known for his groundbreaking films of Yugoslav cinema in the late 1960s and early 1970s—many of which belong to the Black Wave. Makavejev&#x27;s most internationally successful film was the 1971 political satire &quot;W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism&quot;, which he both directed and wrote.

==Career==
Makavejev&#x27;s first three feature films, &quot;Man Is Not a Bird&quot; (1965, starring actress and icon of the &quot;Black Wave&quot; period in film, Milena Dravić), &quot;Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator&quot; (1967, starring actress and icon of the &quot;Black Wave&quot; period in film, Eva Ras) and &quot;Innocence Unprotected&quot; (1968), all won him international acclaim. The last-mentioned won the Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1970 he was a member of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.

His 1971 movie &quot;W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism&quot; (starring Milena Dravić, Jagoda Kaloper, and Ivica Vidović) was banned in Yugoslavia due to its sexual and political content. He described authoritarian figures in the film as people who are not in control of themselves striving to control others. The political scandal surrounding Makavejev&#x27;s film was symptomatic of an increasingly oppressive political climate in Yugoslavia that effectively ended the director&#x27;s domestic career and resulted in his leaving Yugoslavia to live and work abroad in Europe and North America. Makavejev&#x27;s next film, &quot;Sweet Movie&quot; (1974), was the first feature work that the director produced entirely outside of Yugoslavia (the film was made in Canada). The film&#x27;s explicit depiction of sex together with its bold treatment of the more taboo dimensions of sexuality reduced the size of its audience (i.e. it was largely confined to the art house context) and also resulted in the film&#x27;s being censored in several countries. Makavejev said: &quot;After &quot;Sweet Movie&quot; it was as if I had burned all my bridges. I just lost the chance to talk to producers.&quot;

After a seven-year hiatus in feature film production, Makavejev released the comparatively more conventional black comedy entitled &quot;Montenegro&quot; (1981). The director&#x27;s next feature film, &quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; (1985), which was based on short stories by Frank Moorhouse and featured performances by Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi, is arguably his most accessible picture.

Makavejev appears as one of the narrators in the 2007 Serbian documentary film &quot;Zabranjeni bez zabrane&quot; (&quot;Banned without being banned&quot;), which gives profound insight into the history and the nature of Yugoslav film censorship through its investigation of the country&#x27;s distinctive political-cultural mechanisms for unofficially banning politically controversial films. The film contains original interviews with key filmmakers from the communist era.

He published two books of selected articles: &quot;Poljubac za drugaricu parolu&quot; (1960) and &quot;24 sličice u sekundi&quot; (1965).

==Views==

In 1993 Makavejev wrote and appeared in a half hour televised &quot;Opinions&quot; lecture in Britain, produced by Open Media for Channel 4 and subsequently published in &quot;The Times&quot;. Makavejev speaks of himself as a citizen of the world but &quot;of the leftovers of Yugoslavia too&quot;. He cites Jacques Tourneur&#x27;s Hollywood horror classic &quot;Cat People&quot; as one of the rare films in the history of the cinema that mention Serbs, &quot;a people from an obscure region who were haunted by evil; when hurt they turn into ferocious cats, like panthers, and killed those whom they thought to be the source of hurt of rejection&quot;. He comments on the division of Bosnia on ethnic lines:

:&quot;Creators of nationalist myths, both Serbs and Croats, came from the same mountainous region that was probably the source of this Hollywood story. Before the armed conflict, these people were whipping up nationalist fever and indoctrination until conflict became inevitable and both nations were trapped in a bloody embrace...How long will it take for an ethnically &quot;clean&quot; state for every single person who miraculously stays alive? A state for each family, a state for the father in case he is a Croat, a state for the mother in case she is a Muslim, a state for the daughter in case she is a Yugoslav, a state for the son in case he is a Serb, a specific flag for the dog, a currency for the cat.&quot;

<doc id="218663" wikidata="Q5302469" url="?curid=218663" title="Dover Beach">
<text>&quot;Dover Beach&quot; is a lyric poem by the English poet Matthew Arnold. It was first published in 1867 in the collection &quot;New Poems&quot;; however, surviving notes indicate its composition may have begun as early as 1849. The most likely date is 1851.

The title, locale and subject of the poem&#x27;s descriptive opening lines is the shore of the English ferry port of Dover, in Kent, facing Calais, in France, at the Strait of Dover, the narrowest part () of the English Channel, where Arnold spent his honeymoon in 1851. Many of the beaches in this part of England are made up of small stones or pebbles rather than sand, and Arnold describes the sea ebbing over the stones as a &quot;grating roar&quot;.

==Analysis==
In Stefan Collini&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Dover Beach&quot; is a difficult poem to analyze, and some of its passages and metaphors have become so well known that they are hard to see with &quot;fresh eyes&quot;. Arnold begins with a naturalistic and detailed nightscape of the beach at Dover in which auditory imagery plays a significant role (&quot;Listen! you hear the grating roar&quot;). The beach, however, is bare, with only a hint of humanity in a light that &quot;gleams and is gone&quot;. Reflecting the traditional notion that the poem was written during Arnold&#x27;s honeymoon (see composition section), one critic notes that &quot;the speaker might be talking to his bride&quot;. Because Arnold was known for his discontent with the current state of society during his time, this poem is coming from the point of view of a man who feels as though society is not as beautiful as it once was. However, he sees a glimmer of hope through his lover.

Arnold looks at two aspects of this scene, its soundscape (in the first and second stanzas) and the retreating action of the tide (in the third stanza). He hears the sound of the sea as &quot;the eternal note of sadness&quot;. Sophocles, a 5th-century BC Greek playwright who wrote tragedies on fate and the will of the gods, also heard this sound as he stood upon the shore of the Aegean Sea. Critics differ widely on how to interpret this image of the Greek classical age. One sees a difference between Sophocles interpreting the &quot;note of sadness&quot; humanistically, while Arnold, in the industrial nineteenth century, hears in this sound the retreat of religion and faith. A more recent critic connects the two as artists, Sophocles the tragedian, Arnold the lyric poet, each attempting to transform this note of sadness into &quot;a higher order of experience&quot;.

Having examined the soundscape, Arnold turns to the action of the water wave itself and sees in its retreat a metaphor for the loss of faith in the modern age, once again expressed in an auditory image (&quot;But now I only hear / Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar&quot;). This fourth stanza begins with an image not of sadness, but of &quot;joyous fulness&quot; similar in beauty to the image with which the poem opens.

The final stanza begins with an appeal to love, then moves on to the famous ending metaphor. Critics have varied in their interpretation of the first two lines; one calls them a &quot;perfunctory gesture ... swallowed up by the poem&#x27;s powerfully dark picture&quot;, while another sees in them &quot;a stand against a world of broken faith&quot;. Midway between these is one of Arnold&#x27;s biographers, who describes being &quot;true / To one another&quot; as &quot;a precarious notion&quot; in a world that has become &quot;a maze of confusion&quot;.

The metaphor with which the poem ends is most likely an allusion to a passage in Thucydides&#x27;s account of the Peloponnesian War (Book 7, 44). He describes an ancient battle that occurred on a similar beach during the Athenian invasion of Sicily. The battle took place at night; the attacking army became disoriented while fighting in the darkness and many of their soldiers inadvertently killed each other. This final image has also been variously interpreted by the critics. Culler calls the &quot;darkling plain&quot; Arnold&#x27;s &quot;central statement&quot; of the human condition. Pratt sees the final line as &quot;only metaphor&quot; and thus susceptible to the &quot;uncertainty&quot; of poetic language.

&quot;The poem&#x27;s discourse&quot;, Honan tells us, &quot;shifts literally and symbolically from the present, to Sophocles on the Aegean, from Medieval Europe back to the present—and the auditory and visual images are dramatic and mimetic and didactic. Exploring the dark terror that lies beneath his happiness in love, the speaker resolves to love—and exigencies of history and the nexus between lovers are the poem&#x27;s real issues. That lovers may be &#x27;true / To one another&#x27; is a precarious notion: love in the modern city momentarily gives peace, but nothing else in a post-medieval society reflects or confirms the faithfulness of lovers. Devoid of love and light the world is a maze of confusion left by &#x27;retreating&#x27; faith.&quot;

Critics have questioned the unity of the poem, noting that the sea of the opening stanza does not appear in the final stanza, while the &quot;darkling plain&quot; of the final line is not apparent in the opening. Various solutions to this problem have been proffered. One critic saw the &quot;darkling plain&quot; with which the poem ends as comparable to the &quot;naked shingles of the world&quot;. &quot;Shingles&quot; here means flat beach cobbles, characteristic of some wave-swept coasts. Another found the poem &quot;emotionally convincing&quot; even if its logic may be questionable. The same critic notes that &quot;the poem upends our expectations of metaphor&quot; and sees in this the central power of the poem. The poem&#x27;s historicism creates another complicating dynamic. Beginning in the present it shifts to the classical age of Greece, then (with its concerns for the sea of faith) it turns to Medieval Europe, before finally returning to the present. The form of the poem itself has drawn considerable comment. Critics have noted the careful diction in the opening description, the overall, spell-binding rhythm and cadence of the poem and its dramatic character. One commentator sees the strophe-antistrophe of the ode at work in the poem, with an ending that contains something of the &quot;cata-strophe&quot; of tragedy. Finally, one critic sees the complexity of the poem&#x27;s structure resulting in &quot;the first major &#x27;free-verse&#x27; poem in the language&quot;.

==Composition==
According to Tinker and Lowry, &quot;a draft of the first twenty-eight lines of the poem&quot; was written in pencil &quot;on the back of a folded sheet of paper containing notes on the career of Empedocles&quot;. Allott concludes that the notes are probably from around 1849–50. &quot;Empedocles on Etna&quot;, again according to Allott, was probably written 1849–52; the notes on Empedocles are likely to be contemporary with the writing of that poem.

The final line of this draft is:

Tinker and Lowry conclude that this &quot;seem[s] to indicate that the last nine lines of the poem as we know it were already in existence when the portion regarding the ebb and flow of the sea at Dover was composed.&quot; This would make the manuscript &quot;a prelude to the concluding paragraph&quot; of the poem in which &quot;there is no reference to the sea or tides&quot;.

Arnold&#x27;s visits to Dover may also provide some clue to the date of composition. Allott has Arnold in Dover in June 1851 and again in October of that year &quot;on his return from his delayed continental honeymoon&quot;. To critics who conclude that ll. 1–28 were written at Dover and ll. 29–37 &quot;were rescued from some discarded poem&quot; Allott suggests the contrary, i.e., that the final lines &quot;were written at Dover in late June,&quot; while &quot;ll. 29–37 were written in London shortly afterwards&quot;.

==Influence==
William Butler Yeats responds directly to Arnold&#x27;s pessimism in his four-line poem &quot;The Nineteenth Century and After&quot; (1929):

Anthony Hecht, United States Poet Laureate in the early 1980s, replied to &quot;Dover Beach&quot; in his poem &quot;The Dover Bitch&quot;.

The anonymous figure to whom Arnold addresses his poem becomes the subject of Hecht&#x27;s poem. In Hecht&#x27;s poem she &quot;caught the bitter allusion to the sea&quot;, imagined &quot;what his whiskers would feel like / On the back of her neck&quot;, and felt sad as she looked out across the channel. &quot;And then she got really angry&quot; at the thought that she had become &quot;a sort of mournful cosmic last resort&quot;. After which she says &quot;one or two unprintable things&quot;.

Kenneth and Miriam Allott, referring to &quot;The Dover Bitch&quot; as &quot;an irreverent &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot;&quot;, nonetheless see, particularly in the line &quot;a sort of mournful cosmic last resort&quot;, an extension of the original poem&#x27;s main theme.

&quot;Dover Beach&quot; has been mentioned in a number of novels, plays, poems, films and songs:

* Samuel Barber composed a setting of &quot;Dover Beach&quot; in 1931 for baritone and string quartet.
* In Dodie Smith&#x27;s novel, &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; (1940), the book&#x27;s protagonist remarks that Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; reminds her of &quot;Dover Beach&quot; (in the film adaptation of the novel, the character quotes (or, rather, misquotes) a line from the poem).
* In &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953), author Ray Bradbury has his protagonist Guy Montag read part of &quot;Dover Beach&quot; to his wife Mildred and her friends after attempts at intellectual conversation fail and Montag discovers just how shallow and uncaring they are about their families and the world around them. One of Mildred&#x27;s friends cries over the poem while the other chastises Montag for exposing them to something she deems obscene and the two break off their friendship with Mildred in disgust as they leave the house.
* Joseph Heller&#x27;s novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1961) alludes to the poem in the chapter &quot;Havermyer&quot;: &quot;the open-air movie theater in which—for the daily amusement of the dying—ignorant armies clashed by night on a collapsible screen.&quot;
* Charles M. Fair in &quot;The Dying Self&quot; (1969) speaks of &quot;the coming of this unhappy epoch, in which men are a danger to themselves roughly in proportion to their own triviality, announced in the Victorian Age&quot; and exemplified by &quot;the only first-rate poem Arnold ever wrote: &#x27;Dover Beach&#x27;.&quot;
* Ian McEwan quotes part of the poem in his novel &quot;Saturday&quot; (2005), where the effects of its beauty and language are so strong and impressive that it moves a brutal criminal to tears and remorse. He also seems to have borrowed the main setting of his novella On Chesil Beach (2005) from &quot;Dover Beach&quot;, additionally playing with the fact that Arnold&#x27;s poem was composed on his honeymoon (see above).
* Sam Wharton quotes the final stanza in his Jonathan Hare novel &quot;Ignorant Armies&quot;, set in 1954, and one of his characters uses it as a commentary on the failure of senior people to maintain appropriate standards of conduct.
* In the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966), the American aspiring novelist Cliff Bradshaw recites parts of the poem to the singer Sally Bowles because she wants to hear proper English after having been in Berlin for some time.
* In P. D. James&#x27;s novel &quot;Devices and Desires&quot; (1989) her character Adam Dalgliesh, thinking about his response to a police officer after having discovered a murder on a beach on the north-east coast of Norfolk, about &quot;walking and thinking&quot; on the beach notes: &quot;I was thinking about the clash of ignorant armies by night, since no poet walks by the sea at moonlight without silently reciting Matthew Arnold&#x27;s marvellous poem.&quot;

The poem has also provided a ready source for titles:

* &quot;On a Darkling Plain&quot; by Clifford Irving, &quot;A Darkling Plain&quot; by Philip Reeve, &quot;As on a Darkling Plain&quot; by Ben Bova (the title refers to the plain of a Saturnian moon covered with strange unexplained artefacts), &quot;A Tour of the Darkling Plain&quot; (the &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; correspondence of Adaline Glasheen and Thornton Wilder), &quot;Clash by Night&quot;, a play by Clifford Odets (later made into a film noir by Fritz Lang), &quot;Clash by Night&quot;, a science fiction novel by Lewis Padgett (Henry Kuttner &amp; CL Moore), &quot;Ignorant Armies&quot; by Sam Wharton, and Norman Mailer&#x27;s National Book Award winner &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot;, about the 1967 March on the Pentagon.
* The Sea of Faith movement is so called as the name is taken from this poem, as the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the &quot;sea of faith&quot; is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.
* &quot;Sea of Faith&quot; by John Brehm, a collection of poems [The University of Wisconsin Press, 2004] (and the title of the eponymous poem, which begins &quot;Once when I was teaching &#x27;Dover Beach&#x27;&quot;.
* &quot;Dover Beach&quot; by Billy Collins. 
* In the Richard Condon novel &quot;Arigato&quot; (1972), the protagonist Captain Huntingdon ponders leaving his innocence behind and recites the following lines: 

Even in the U. S. Supreme Court the poem has had its influence: Justice William Rehnquist, in his concurring opinion in &quot;Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.&quot;, 458 US 50 (1982), called judicial decisions regarding Congress&#x27;s power to create legislative courts &quot;landmarks on a judicial &#x27;darkling plain&#x27; where ignorant armies have clashed by night.&quot;

<doc id="218664" wikidata="Q1138056" url="?curid=218664" title="Coventry Canal">
<text>The Coventry Canal is a navigable narrow canal in the Midlands of England.

It starts in Coventry and ends to the north at Fradley Junction, just north of Lichfield, where it joins the Trent and Mersey Canal. It also has connections with the Ashby Canal, the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and the Oxford Canal.

Some maps show the canal as a northern and a southern section, connected by a stretch of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, but others, including the Canal and River Trust show the through route as the Coventry Canal. This reflects a complicated period of ownership and re-leasing when the Coventry Canal company was in financial difficulties during construction.

It runs through or past the towns of Bedworth, Nuneaton, Atherstone, Polesworth and Tamworth. It is navigable for boats up to length, beam and headroom. It forms part of the Warwickshire ring.

==Route in detail==

The canal starts at Coventry Canal Basin. The basin was opened in 1769 and expanded in 1788. It is situated just north of Coventry City Centre and just outside the city&#x27;s inner ring road. Many of the buildings and the site were restored between 1993 and 1995. The Canal Bridge, Canal House and the warehouses are grade II listed buildings. All boats going in and out of Coventry Canal Basin have to pass through the Canal Bridge.

From the canal basin, the canal meanders north through Coventry passing under many road bridges including prominent hump-back bridges under the Foleshill Road, Foleshill through Little Heath and the Longford Road, Longford.

Five miles north of Coventry, at Hawkesbury Junction, a superbly preserved iron bridge crosses the start of the Oxford Canal, which journeys southwards to join the River Thames at Oxford. At Hawkesbury Junction there are buildings from the working days of the canal, and the Greyhound pub is a traditional stop for boaters. Hawkesbury Junction is also known to regular boaters as Sutton Stop, though strictly this refers to the stop lock, a short distance along the Oxford Canal.

A few miles north of Hawkesbury, just outside Bedworth, is Marston Junction, where the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal starts its meandering, rural and lock-free journey towards the former coal mines at Moira; although it is now navigable only for to Snarestone.

From Marston Junction, the Coventry canal runs north-west through Nuneaton, Atherstone and Polesworth, to Tamworth. At Atherstone a set of 11 locks (Top Lock No. 1 to Atherstone Bottom Lock No. 11) lower the level of the canal towards Polesworth. The only other locks on the Coventry canal are the two Glascote locks which lower the level of the canal a further about before Fazeley Junction.

In a suburb of Tamworth, at Fazeley Junction, boaters can turn south towards Birmingham along the Birmingham &amp; Fazeley Canal.

The Coventry Canal continues northwards to end at Fradley Junction where it joins the Trent and Mersey Canal. From Fazeley to a point halfway to Fradley, some maps show the canal as the &quot;Birmingham and Fazeley Canal&quot; (see History).

==History==
The Coventry Canal Company was formed by the (8 Geo. 3. c. 36). James Brindley was commissioned to build the canal, and work started on it in December that year. Due to the high standards of construction demanded by Brindley, the canal company ran out of money by the time the canal had reached Atherstone in 1769, and Brindley was replaced by Thomas Yeoman.

Thomas Dadford advised on the canal&#x27;s aqueduct over the River Tame (now known as Tame Aqueduct) in 1784, and in June 1785 Thomas Sheasby was awarded the contract to connect the Coventry Canal to the Trent and Mersey Canal.

Although the canal reached the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal at Fazeley, the final Parliament-approved stretch to the Trent and Mersey at Fradley was not finished until 1789.

The Trent and Mersey company, and the Birmingham and Fazeley company, anxious to allow through traffic between Birmingham and the Trent and Mersey Canal, gained permission to complete and operate the approved but unbuilt section from Fazeley to Fradley. The B&amp;F worked north from Fazeley, and the T&amp;M worked south from Fradley. The full length from Coventry to Fradley was opened in 1789.

The Coventry Canal Company later bought the northern section, nowadays sometimes referred to as &quot;Coventry Canal (detached portion)&quot;, while the middle section remained under the ownership of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, and thus some maps show this middle section as the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, but others describe the complete route as the Coventry Canal. The Canal and River Trust who manage the canal describe the whole route from Coventry to the Trent and Mersey Canal as the Coventry Canal.

==Operation==
The Coventry canal was a vital trade artery for many years. In particular, it was part of a Birmingham–London route via the B&amp;F Canal, Coventry Canal, Oxford Canal, and the Thames.

When the Grand Junction Canal and some smaller companies (which much later merged to form the Grand Union Canal company) opened a direct rival route from Birmingham to London, via Warwick, Napton, Braunston, and Bletchley, trade still remained high on the Coventry. This was partly because of the work done by the Oxford company to shorten its route north of Braunston, and because Grand Junction traffic using the Braunston–Fazeley route avoided the high tolls charged by the Oxford Canal company on its Braunston–Napton section (which was also part of the new route).

The Coventry paid a dividend right up to 1947 and remained navigable to the present day. Today, the canal is also a popular route for narrowboat trips. Many tourists hire narrowboats to explore Coventry&#x27;s industrial heritage.

It was nationalised in 1948 being operated first by the British Transport Commission and then by the British Waterways Board, the forerunners of Canal &amp; River Trust.

In 1957, Coventry Canal Society was established to promote the proper use and maintenance of the canal, and to protect its interests. The canal acts as a base to Mercia Canoe Club, which is part of Coventry Canal Society.

<text>Franco-Ontarians ( or if female, sometimes known as &quot;Ontarois&quot; and &quot;Ontaroises&quot;) are Francophone Canadians that reside in the province of Ontario. Most are French Canadians from Ontario. In 2021, according to the Government of Ontario, there were Francophones in the province. The majority of Franco-Ontarians in the province reside in Eastern Ontario, Northeastern Ontario, Central Ontario (including the Greater Toronto Area), although small francophone communities may be found in other regions of the province.

The first francophones to settle in Ontario did so during the early 17th century, when most of it was part of the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; region of New France. However, French settlement into the area remained limited until the 19th century. The late 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts by the provincial government to assimilate the Franco-Ontarian population into the anglophone majority with the introduction of regulations that promoted the use of English over French, for example Regulation 17. During the late 1960s and 1970s, because of the Quiet Revolution, Franco-Ontarians established themselves as a distinct cultural identity – having only identified as French Canadians before. Francophone rights were furthered in the 1970s as a result of &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;temps&quot;, a Franco-Ontarian civil disobedience movement that pressured several provincial departments to adopt bilingual policies. 

The provincial government passed the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; in 1986 which recognized the French language as a &quot;historic language of Ontario,&quot; and as an official language of the province&#x27;s education system, judiciary, and legislature. However, the Act did not make the French language an official language in its entirety; with other provincial services only made available in French in designated communities and regions with a significant Franco-Ontarian population. 
==Definition==
The term &quot;Franco-Ontarian&quot; has two related usages, which overlap closely but are not identical: it may refer to francophone residents of Ontario, regardless of their ethnicity or place of birth, or to people of French Canadian ancestry &quot;born&quot; in Ontario, regardless of their primary language or current place of residence. In June 2009, the provincial government expanded the definition of a francophone as a person whose mother tongue is French, or a person that has a different mother tongue but still uses French as the primary language at home. The term &quot;Ontarois&quot; is used sometimes to distinguish French-speaking Ontarians, while the general term for Ontarian in French is &quot;Ontarien&quot;. The use of the term &quot;Ontarois&quot; follows the convention that a francophone minority is referred to with endings of -ois.

In popular usage, the first meaning predominates and the second is poorly understood. Although most Franco-Ontarians meet both definitions, there are notable exceptions. For example, although Louise Charron was the first native-born Franco-Ontarian appointed to the bench of the Supreme Court of Canada, she was preceded as a francophone judge from Ontario by Louise Arbour, a Quebecer who worked in Ontario for much of her professional career as a lawyer and judge. As a result, both women have been referred to as &quot;the first Franco-Ontarian Supreme Court justice&quot;, although the technically correct practice is to credit Charron, Franco-Ontarian in both senses, with that distinction.

Conversely, two of the most famous rock musicians from Ontario, Avril Lavigne and Alanis Morissette, are Franco-Ontarian by the second definition but not by the first, since they were born to Franco-Ontarian parents but currently live outside Ontario and work primarily in English. Former Prime Minister Paul Martin was born in Windsor to a Franco-Ontarian father from Pembroke and an anglophone mother, although many Canadians consider him a Quebecer as he represented a Montreal riding in Parliament.

Both meanings can be politically charged. Using the second to the exclusion of the first may be considered offensive to some in that it excludes francophones born in or with ethnic origins from other francophone countries from the Franco-Ontarian community. Using the first to the exclusion of the second obscures the very real ethno-cultural distinctions that exist between Franco-Ontarians, Québécois, Acadians, Métis and other Canadian francophone communities, and the pressures toward assimilation into the English Canadian majority that the community faces. As a result, the complex political and sociological context of &quot;Franco-Ontarian&quot; can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings and understanding the distinctions between the two.

==Demographics==
Franco-Ontarians constitute the largest French-speaking community in Canada outside Quebec. According to the province of Ontario, there are Francophones in Ontario, making up 4.6 per cent of the province&#x27;s population. However, the figure is derived from the province&#x27;s &quot;Inclusive Definition of Francophones&quot; (IDF), which includes respondents from the 2021 Canadian Census who reported French as their mother tongue and respondents whose mother tongue was not French but have proficiency in the language and use it as their primary language at home. Before the introduction of IDF in 2009, a respondent&#x27;s mother tongue was the main measure used by the government to determined the number of francophones in the province. There were Ontarians, or 4.2 per cent of the population, that reported having French as a mother tongue in the 2021 census, making it the most common mother tongue in the province after English.

The majority of Franco-Ontarians are bilingual in both French and English; a minority (40,045 respondents in 2016) reported having proficiency in only the French language and limited or no knowledge of English. In the same census, more than 1.52 million Ontarians, or 11.5 per cent of the province&#x27;s population, reported having proficiency in the French language; while 11.2 per cent of the population reported to be bilingual in French and English. However, that figure includes both Franco-Ontarians and Ontarians who speak French as a second language.

In 2016, approximately 16.1 per cent of francophone Ontarians identified as a visible minority. More than half of Ontario&#x27;s francophone visible minority population reside within Central Ontario (including the Greater Toronto Area), with 37.8 per cent residing in Eastern Ontario, and the remaining 5.7 per cent in other areas of the province.

In 2016, 59.5 per cent of francophones in Ontario were born in the province, while 19.6 per cent originated from Quebec, and 16.4 per cent came from all other provinces or territories in Canada. However, the percentage of those born in the province varies between region, with 85.3 per cent of francophones in Northeastern Ontario being born in Ontario; whereas only 39.6 per cent of francophones in Central Ontario were born in the province. 4.5 per cent of francophones in Ontario were born outside Canada. 35 per cent of francophones born outside Canada were born in Africa, while 28 per cent were from Europe, 20 per cent from Asia, and 17 per cent from other countries in the Americas. Francophone immigrants account for 15 per cent of all immigrants into Ontario, and nearly a third of all immigrants into Central Ontario. 17.4 per cent of immigrants to the province between 2011 and 2016 were francophone.

===Communities===

Franco-Ontarians may be found in all areas of Ontario. Approximately 43.1 per cent of francophones in province reside in Eastern Ontario, with 268,070 francophones living in that region. Francophones comprise approximately 15.4 per cent of Eastern Ontario&#x27;s total population. More than 68 per cent of francophones that live in Eastern Ontario reside in its Champlain region, an area that encompasses Cornwall, Hawkesbury, Ottawa and Pembroke (all of which are adjacent to or near the Ontario-Quebec border). 

However, Northeastern Ontario is the region that has the highest proportion of francophones, with the 122,360 francophone residents of the region making up 22.6 per cent of the region&#x27;s population. Central Ontario also has a large population of Franco-Ontarians, with 191,375 francophones residing in that region, which includes 63,055 Franco-Ontarians living in the Greater Toronto Area. Other areas include 33,555 Franco-Ontarians in Southwestern Ontario and 7,055 Franco-Ontarians in Northwestern Ontario.

==History==
===Early history===

Étienne Brûlé is often considered the first francophone and European to have arrived in the region in 1610. During this time, most of Ontario formed a part of New France&#x27;s &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; region; with most of the European inhabitants in the region at the time being coureurs de bois and voyageurs, or Jesuit missionaries in Huronia; most notably the settlements of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons (in present-day Midland) in 1649, and another settlement in Sault Sainte Marie in 1668. During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the military of New France established a number of fortifications and garrisons in the region, including Fort Frontenac (in present-day Kingston) in 1673, and Fort Rouillé (in present-day Toronto) in 1750. The development of Fort Pontchartrain in Detroit, led to the development of Petite Côte, a permanent settlement south of the Detroit River. The settlement was the first permanent settlement in Ontario, and eventually became Windsor. However, European settlement into the region remained largely limited during this period.

After the Treaty of Paris was negotiated in 1763, New France was ceded to the British. Present day Ontario was governed as a part of the Province of Quebec until 1791, when Ontario was severed from the colony, forming Upper Canada. In 1797, the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada passed the &quot;Upper Canada School Act&quot;, which provided for schools that used English and French and instructional languages. In 1798, during the final years of the French Revolution, French nobleman Joseph-Geneviève de Puisaye led a small group of royalists from France to settle lands north of York (present day Toronto). 

French migration into Canada West/Ontario did not accelerate until the second half of the 19th century, farmers from Canada East/Quebec began to migrate in search of fertile land in Eastern Ontario, and along the Canadian Pacific Railway north of Lake Nipissing and Lake Huron. A large number of French Canadians were also drawn to Northern Ontario during this period, with the discovery of nickel in Sudbury, and gold in Timmins.

In an attempt to alleviate anti-French sentiments, in 1885 George William Ross, the provincial Minister of Education, mandated the requirement of English to be taught in francophone schools for two hours in the first four years of elementary school, and for four hours in its final four years.

===20th century===
====1901–1950====
The late 19th century, and early 20th century saw the Ontario government much less supportive of, and often openly hostile toward the Franco-Ontarian community. In an attempt to protect Franco-Ontarian language rights, the &quot;Association canadienne-française d&#x27;Éducation de l&#x27;Ontario&quot; (ACFÉO) was formed in 1910, who typically opposed the English-only initiatives launched by the Orange Order of Canada, and Irish Catholics led by Michael Fallon, the Bishop of London, Ontario. However, French Canadian migration throughout Ontario continued, with sawmills and papermills in Kapuskasing, and Hearst; and automotive plants in Oshawa and Windsor attracting French Canadian laborers during the 1920s.
In 1912, the provincial government passed Regulation 17, which limited the use of the French as the primary language of instruction to the first two years of elementary school. However, enforcement of the regulation was abandoned in 1927, when it became apparent to the provincial government that the regulation perpetuated inferior schooling of pupils in the province. Instead, a new policy permitting French-language schools instruction was introduced, with French given legal status in Ontario&#x27;s education system, and the bilingual University of Ottawa Normal School was officially recognized. The regulation formally remained in the statutes of Ontario until 1944, when the regulations were revised.

Although the regulation itself was rescinded in 1927, the government did not fund French language high schools. As a result, francophones had to pursue high school education in English, pay tuition to private high schools (which few Franco-Ontarian families could afford), or simply stop attending school after Grade 9. Due to the lack of funding, several generations of Franco-Ontarians grew up without formal education, with the dropout rate for francophones high during this period. Franco-Ontarians thus opted for jobs which did not require reading and mathematical skills, such as mining and forestry, and were virtually absent from white collar jobs. Sociologically, it meant that education was not a value transmitted to younger Franco-Ontarians. Further, those that did have higher levels of education often pursue job opportunities in larger cities, particularly Ottawa or even Montreal, which can create a barrier to economic development in their home communities. As well, even today many students of Franco-Ontarian background are still educated in anglophone schools. This has the effect of reducing the use of French as a first language in the province, and thereby limiting the growth of the Franco-Ontarian community.

Quebec writer Yves Beauchemin once controversially referred to the Franco-Ontarian community as &quot;warm corpses&quot; (« cadavres encore chauds ») who had no chance of surviving as a community. In a similar vein, former Quebec Premier René Lévesque referred to them as &quot;dead ducks&quot;.

====1951–2000====
The late 1960s saw a schism form between the francophones in Quebec, and the other francophone communities of Canada, notably the francophones in Ontario. The emergence of a separate &quot;québécois&quot; identity during the Quiet Revolution; also resulted in the development of a unique Franco-Ontarian identity, with francophones in Ontario forced to re-conceptualize their identities without relying on francophones in Quebec.

Recommendations from the Provincial Committee on Aims and Objectives of Education in the Schools of Ontario, and the Bériault Report led to the provincial government passing the &quot;Schools Administration Act&quot;, and the &quot;Secondary Schools and Boards Act&quot; in 1968. The following acts introduced public funding for French-language secondary schools, and laid the foundation for the province&#x27;s present elementary and secondary francophone school system. In 1969, the provincial government established its French-language public educational broadcaster, TFO.

Following the advice of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, Ontario&#x27;s premier John Robarts made French an official language of the provincial legislature in 1970. While the Victoria Charter was being negotiated between the provincial premiers and the federal government, Robarts agreed that the province would recognize Franco-Ontarians rights to access provincial public service in the French language, and for French-speakers to receive the services of an interpreter, if needed, in Ontario&#x27;s courts. However, plans to adopt these measures were abandoned after negotiations for the Victoria Charter collapsed. His successor, Bill Davis instead opted to simply provide legal services in French, with the issuance of bilingual drivers licenses and government documents.

A civil disobedience movement made up of Franco-Ontarian wanting to further accessibility rights for French-speakers emerged in 1975, known as &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;temps&quot;. Members of &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;temps&quot; refused to pay tickets issued in only in English, pressuring the provincial judiciary to act in a bilingual manner. As a result of the protest, the Ontario&#x27;s Attorney General, Roy McMurtry authorized the first French-language provincial court proceeding in 1976. 

Other departments in the government of Ontario also began to adopt policies of bilingualism, and policies for French services, such as the Ministry of Health in 1979, and the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services in 1980. French was formally made an official language of the provincial judiciary in 1984. In 1986, the provincial &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, where it recognized French as a &quot;historic language in Ontario,&quot; an official language in its courts and in education, as well as the &quot;desirable use&quot; of French in its provincial institutions including the Legislature. However, the Act itself did not make the province bilingual, instead designating a number of communities where French-speakers constitute a majority or significant minority, as an area where provincial services are required to be provided in French and English.

The following legislation saw pushback from several anglophone Ontario towns and cities, most notably Sault Ste. Marie, which was persuaded by the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada to declare themselves &quot;English-only&quot; in the wake of the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; and the Meech Lake Accord debate. This was considered by many observers to be a direct contributor to the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement in the 1990s, and consequently to the 1995 Quebec referendum.

===21st century===
On October 19, 2004, a Toronto lawyer successfully challenged a &quot;no left turn&quot; traffic ticket on the basis that the sign was not bilingual in accordance with the 1986 &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;. The judge in &quot;R. v. Myers&quot; ruled that the traffic sign was not a municipal service, but instead was regulated under the provincial &quot;Highway Traffic Act&quot; and therefore subject to the bilingual requirements of the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;. As this was a lower court ruling, it did not affect any other court. However the implication of the decision was that many traffic signs in bilingually designated areas of Ontario would be invalid. It was feared that the ruling would have a similar effect as the Manitoba Language Rights ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada, in this case forcing municipalities to erect new bilingual road signs at great expense and invalidating millions of dollars in existing tickets before the courts. The City of Toronto appealed the ruling. At the appeal hearing both parties asked the court to enter a plea of guilty. A guilty verdict was entered even though no arguments were made by either side on the merits of the case. The situation created a legal vacuum for several years, during which numerous defendants used the bilingual signage argument to fight traffic tickets. The precedent was overturned by the Ontario Court of Appeal in a 2011 case, &quot;R. v. Petruzzo&quot;, on the grounds that the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; specifically states that municipalities are not required to offer services in French, even in provincially regulated areas such as traffic signage, if the municipality has not specifically passed its own bylaw governing its own provision of bilingual services.

Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Francophone Affairs, Madeleine Meilleur, became the province&#x27;s first cabinet minister to attend a Francophonie summit in 2004, travelling to Ouagadougou with counterparts from Quebec, New Brunswick and the federal government. Meilleur also expressed the hope that Ontario would someday become a permanent member of the organization. On November 26, 2016, Ontario was granted observer status by La Francophonie.

On January 10, 2005, Clarence-Rockland became the first Ontario city to pass a bylaw requiring all new businesses to post signs in both official languages. Clarence-Rockland is 60 per cent francophone, and the city council noted that the bylaw was intended to address the existence of both English-only and French-only commercial signage in the municipality.

In 2008, the provincial government officially introduced a French licence plate, with the French slogan &quot;Tant à découvrir&quot; in place of &quot;Yours to Discover&quot;, as an optional feature for drivers who wished to use it.

In 2009, the government faced controversy during the H1N1 flu pandemic, when it sent out a health information flyer in English only, with no French version published or distributed for the province&#x27;s francophone residents. In response, MPP France Gélinas introduced a private member&#x27;s bill in May 2011 to have the provincial Commissioner of French Language Services report to the full Legislative Assembly of Ontario rather than exclusively to the Minister of Francophone Affairs.

====2010s====
On April 26, 2010, the Ontario government designated September 25 as Franco-Ontarian Day. This date was chosen as it represented the anniversary of the official raising of the Franco-Ontarian flag in 1975. On 22 February 2016, premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne formally issued an apology on behalf of the government of Ontario to Franco-Ontarians for the passage of Regulation 17, and its harmful impact on its communities. The motion for the government to present an official apology to the Franco-Ontarian community was first presented by Glenn Thibeault.

In 2015, MPP France Gélinas introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to mandate the creation of a fully independent French-language university. Although her bill did not pass, the government of Kathleen Wynne announced the creation of a French-language university in 2017.

In 2018, the provincial government of Doug Ford announced several government cutbacks that impacted the Franco-Ontarian community, including ending the position of the French Language Services Commissioner and transferring its responsibilities to the office of the Ontario Ombudsman, reducing the status of the Ministry of Francophone Affairs from a full ministry to a government office, and cancelling funding announced by the prior government of Kathleen Wynne for the creation of the French-language university. After extensive backlash to the announcement, Ford reversed course, announcing that the commissioner position would be retained and that the office of francophone affairs would be restored to a full government ministry. The actions led to one Franco-Ontarian MPP, Amanda Simard, leaving his caucus to sit as an independent. During this period, governments in Quebec began to fly the Franco-Ontarian flag as a gesture of solidarity. The flag was hoisted at Montreal City Hall on November 23, and at the National Assembly of Quebec on December 1.

Ford later cancelled funding for the new Francophone university, created by the previous government. However, in September 2019 the provincial and federal governments announced a new funding plan for the creation of the first French language university in the province. The province&#x27;s first publicly-funded university that operates solely as a French-language institution was incorporated in April 2018 as the Université de l&#x27;Ontario français, expecting to accept its first cohort of full-time students in 2021.

====2020s====
On September 21, 2020, Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed an amendment to the &quot;Franco-Ontarian Emblem Act, 2001&quot;, first proposed by Progressive Conservative MPP, Natalia Kusendova, to designate Franco-Ontarian flag as an official emblem of Ontario. It received royal assent and became law on September 24, 2020.

On September 25, 2020, the government under Doug Ford, through Minister of Francophone Affairs, Caroline Mulroney, announced that Franco-Ontarians will be able to request a free replacement driver&#x27;s licence or Ontario photo card displaying their name using French-language characters.

The Université de Hearst, which teaches entirely in French and for decades operated as a federated college of Laurentian University using Laurentian&#x27;s degree-granting authority, was chartered as a fully independent university in 2021.

==Politics==
The Ministry of Francophone Affairs is a department of the government of Ontario responsible for the provision of provincial services to the Franco-Ontarian community. Caroline Mulroney is the provincial cabinet minister responsible for the Francophone Affairs portfolio. The French language has been recognized as an official language of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario since 1970. 

In 2016, the government of Ontario was granted observer status to the &quot;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&quot;, permitting the provincial government to submit requests to the organization&#x27;s ministerial conferences, and participate in certain meetings held by the organization. Ontario is one of four governments in Canada that participates in the &quot;Francophonie&quot;, with the federal government of Canada and the provincial governments of New Brunswick and Quebec being full-fledged members of the organization.

===Access to services===
Although French is an official language in Ontario&#x27;s education system, legislature, and judiciary, the province as a whole is not officially bilingual and its other provincial services do not provide English/French bilingual service throughout the entirety of the province. However, the Ontario &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; requires all provincial ministries and agencies to provide French-language services within 26 designated municipalities and regions. 

An area is designated as a French service area if the francophone population is greater than 5,000 people &quot;or&quot; 10 percent of the community&#x27;s total population. Due to the 5,000 population threshold, large cities that are actually overwhelmingly anglophone with only very small francophone populations proportional to the size of the city, such as Toronto and Mississauga, are nevertheless still subject to the Act. Francophones who live in non-designated areas can also receive French language services by directly contacting the Office of Francophone Affairs in Toronto, or in the nearest designated community. The most recent addition to the list of designated areas is the city of Markham. It was named in June 2015, and after the three-year implementation period provided for by the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;, officially became a bilingual service centre in 2018. Enforcement of the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; is conducted through the office of the provincial French Language Services Commissioner. 

The following census divisions (denoted in dark blue on the map) are designated areas in their entirety:

* Algoma District
* Cochrane District
* Greater Sudbury
* City of Hamilton
* Nipissing District
* City of Ottawa
* Prescott and Russell United Counties
* Sudbury District
* Timiskaming District
* City of Toronto

The following census divisions (denoted in light blue on the map) are not fully designated areas, but have communities within their borders which are designated for bilingual services:

*Municipality of Chatham-Kent: Tilbury, Dover Township, Tilbury East Township
*Essex County: Lakeshore, Tecumseh, Windsor
*Frontenac County: Kingston
*Kenora District: Ignace
*Middlesex County: London
*Niagara Region: Port Colborne, Welland
*Peel Region: Mississauga, Brampton
*Renfrew County: Laurentian Valley, Pembroke, Whitewater Region
*Thunder Bay District: Greenstone, Manitouwadge, Marathon, Terrace Bay
*Simcoe County: Essa, Penetanguishene, Tiny
*United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry: Cornwall, North Glengarry, North Stormont, South Glengarry, South Stormont, Winchester
*York Region: Markham

The &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; only applies to provincial government services, and does not require services operated by the municipal government to provide bilingual services, although several municipalities have done so at their own discretion. There are presently 44 communities in Ontario whose municipal government and services are bilingual in English and French. Most of these are communities are members of the Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario, or &quot;AFMO&quot;.

====Judicial access====

The provincial judicial system is officially bilingual in English and French, with access to a French-speaking justice viewed as a quasi-constitutional right in Ontario. The official languages of the provincial courts was set in s. 125 of the &quot;Courts of Justice Act&quot;, with s. 126 of the same act outlining the specific rights afforded to a French-speaking party. French-language access within Ontario&#x27;s judicial administrative offices is also required in designated communities under the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;. Francophone linguistic rights are further reinforced for criminal cases as those tried under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, a federal statute, have the right to be tried in either English or French as specified in section 530 of the Code.

However, in practice the courts function primarily in English. Francophones in some parts of the province have noted some difficulty in actually accessing French language services, especially in civil litigation matters; for example, francophones in the justice system have sometimes faced unnecessary and expensive delays in their judicial proceedings, or been forced to proceed in English even if they were merely functional but not fluent in the language, due to gaps in the system&#x27;s ability to actually provide full French services. Acting upon a number of complaints received from the French Language Service Commissioner, the Attorney General of Ontario launched a committee in 2009 to address French language rights in the judicial system.

==Education==
===Elementary and secondary===
Legislation on educational instruction in the French language was first passed in Upper Canada under the &quot;Upper Canada School Act, 1797&quot;, which provided for schools that used English or French as an instructional languages. The use of French as the primary language of instruction was later limited to the first two years of elementary education in Ontario, from 1912 to 1927. In 1927, its enforcement was dropped with the province again permitting French-language instruction past Grade 2. The present public French-language elementary and secondary school system originates from education reforms implemented by the province in 1968. French-language rights for resident elementary and secondary school students in Ontario are afforded through the provincial &quot;Education Act&quot; and Section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

Public education in Ontario is managed by the provincial Ministry of Education, which sets the guidelines and curriculum for both its English and French language public school systems. There were 103,490 students enrolled in Ontario&#x27;s public francophone elementary and secondary schools during the 2015–16 academic year.

In addition to language, public education in Ontario is also split between a secularized, and separate school school systems. As a result, twelve public francophone school boards operate within the province; with four secularized public school boards forming a part of the &quot;Association des conseils scolaires des écoles publiques de l&#x27;Ontario&quot;, and eight separate school boards forming a part of &quot;Association franco-ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques&quot;. In 2016, Ontario&#x27;s public francophone school boards operated 351 elementary schools, and 104 secondary schools.

These school boards were formed after the passage of the &quot;Fewer School Boards Act&quot; in 1997, with a number of secularized and separate school boards being split and re-consolidated into larger school districts based on language. The re-consolidated French school boards often serve a significantly larger catchment area than an English-language school board in the province, due to the smaller francophone population.

In addition to public elementary and secondary school, a number of private schools also operate with French as the primary instructional language.

===Post-secondary===

Ontario is home to several public post-secondary institutions that operate either as francophone or as bilingual English and French institutions. There were approximately 21,300 students enrolled in a post-secondary francophone program/institution in Ontario during the 2015–16 academic year.

Ontario has two francophone post-secondary colleges, Collège Boréal, and Collège La Cité. The former is based in Sudbury, and operates satellite campuses throughout Ontario; while the latter is based in Ottawa, with a satellite campus in Hawkesbury. A third French-language college, Collège des Grands-Lacs, formerly operated in Toronto from 1995 to 2002. After the college ceased operations, its programs were taken over by Collège Boréal.

There are several publicly-funded universities in Ontario where French is the official instructional language. Universities that operate as francophone institutions includes the Université de Hearst and the Université de l&#x27;Ontario français. Five other Ontario-based universities are officially bilingual institutions, offering instruction in both English and French, Laurentian University, the Royal Military College of Canada, the University of Ottawa, the University of Sudbury, and the Northern Ontario School of Medicine University.

Three other universities in Ontario also maintain federated or affiliated institutions that provide bilingual instruction in either English or French. Although these affiliated institutions and schools are bilingual, their parent universities are otherwise considered anglophone institutions. Affiliated institutions that are bilingual include Dominican University College, an institution affiliated with Carleton University in Ottawa; Glendon College, an institution affiliated with York University in Toronto; and Saint Paul University, an institution federated with the University of Ottawa. Additionally, the University of Toronto also operates the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, a functionally bilingual graduate school.

==Language==
The dialects of French spoken in Ontario are similar to, but distinct from, Quebec French and constitute part of the greater Canadian French dialect. According to Michel Laurier (1989), the semantic and stylistic value of the use of the subjunctive is progressively disappearing. In the article &quot;Le français canadien parlé hors Québec : aperçu sociolinguistique &quot; (1989), Edward Berniak and Raymond Mougeon underline some characteristics: 
* the use of the possessive &quot;à&quot;
* the transfer of rules from English to French, e.g., &quot;J’ai vu un film sur/à la télévision&quot; which comes from &quot;I saw a film on television&quot;, or &quot; Je vais à la maison/chez moi &quot; coming from &quot;I&#x27;m going home&quot;.
* the loaning of English conjunctions, for instance, &quot;so&quot; for &quot;ça fait que&quot; or &quot;alors&quot;.

Due to the large English majority in the province, English loanwords are sometimes used in the informal or slang registers of Franco-Ontarian French. While English loanwords occur to a large extent in many varieties of French in Canada and Europe, there has been more of a conscious effort in Quebec to eliminate anglicisms. In addition, the majority of Franco-Ontarians are, out of necessity, functionally or fluently bilingual in English, a fact that encourages borrowing, as does the fact that the English language has a greater prestige in the province from its being a majority language. Franco-Ontarian communities with a small francophone population tend to have more English-influenced French, and some younger speakers there may feel more comfortable using English than French. On the other hand, the French spoken in French-dominant Ontarian communities (such as Hearst and Hawkesbury), or in those communities near the Quebec border (such as Ottawa), is virtually indistinguishable from Quebec French.

Furthermore, improved access to publicly funded French-language schools and the establishment of bilingual universities and French language community colleges has improved French-language proficiency in younger populations.

==Culture==
The primary cultural organization of the Franco-Ontarian community is the Assemblée de la francophonie de l&#x27;Ontario, or AFO, which coordinates many of the community&#x27;s cultural and political activities.

Franco-Ontarians retain many cultural traditions from their French Canadian ancestry. For example, unmarried elder siblings &quot;dansent sur leurs bas&quot; (dance on their socks) when their younger siblings get married. Catholic Franco-Ontarians attend &quot;messe de minuit&quot; (midnight mass) on Christmas Eve. Many Franco-Ontarians also enjoy late night feasts/parties on Christmas Eve, called &quot;réveillon&quot;, at which tourtière is a common dish. They also celebrate Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day on June 24 as the national holiday for French Canadians.

===Franco-Ontarian identity===
The concept of Franco-Ontarians as a distinct cultural identity emerged during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Prior to this time, virtually all French Canadians were understood as a single unified cultural group regardless of which province they lived in, with Quebec serving as the &quot;citadel&quot; of French Canada.

However, the Estates General of French Canada of 1966 to 1969 radically reshaped the landscape of French Canadian identity. During the Estates General of Canada the Quebec delegation, influenced by the Quiet Revolution, had pushed forward a new concept of a uniquely &quot;québécois&quot; identity, believing that the French Canadian population risked assimilation unless they focused their efforts on saving &quot;the body of the nation,&quot; namely Quebec. However, many Franco-Ontarians perceived the refocus in priorities by the Quebec delegation as an abandonment of the other French Canadian communities, and their shared French Canadian identity. This resulted in what is sometimes described as a &quot;rupture&quot; between the francophones of Quebec, and the Franco-Ontarian community, who were then forced to re-conceptualize their own cultural identities while being reliant on the federal government, as opposed to Quebec.

The actual depth of this &quot;rupture&quot; has been questioned by academics, as Quebec continues to exert strong cultural influence on francophone minority communities in the rest of Canada. However, it remains a prominent theme in contemporary cultural analysis of French Canadian identities, 
It is also evident that by the early 1970s, a uniquely Franco-Ontarian cultural space had emerged with the creation of new institutions and symbols. 

===Symbols===
====Franco-Ontarian Flag====

The Franco-Ontarian flag consists of two bands of green and white. The left portion has a solid light green background with a white fleur-de-lys in the middle, while the right portion has a solid white background with a stylized green trillium in the middle. The green represents the summer months, while the white represents the winter months. The trillium is the floral symbol of Ontario, while the fleur-de-lys represents the French-Canadian heritage of the Franco-Ontarian community. The green color on the flag is Pantone 349.

The flag was created in 1975 by Gaétan Gervais, history professor and Michel Dupuis, first year political science student, both from Laurentian University. It was officially recognized by the Ontario PC government as the emblem of the Franco-Ontarian community in the &quot;Franco-Ontarian Emblem Act&quot; of 2001. In September 2020, the flag was made an official emblem of the province.

==== Franco-Ontarian Day ====
Franco-Ontarian Day is celebrated on September 25, the anniversary of the first raising of the Franco-Ontarian flag in Sudbury in 1975. 

In 2010, the Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs Madeleine Meilleur introduced Bill 24 to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario to have Franco-Ontarian Day officially recognised by the province. The bill, the &quot;Franco-Ontarian Day Act, 2010&quot;, passed unanimously and received royal assent in May 2010.

====Monuments====
Seven monuments known as &quot;Les Monuments de la francophonie d&#x27;Ottawa&quot;, were erected in Ottawa by the francophone community to commemorate francophone contribution to the development and well-being of the city. The first of the series of monuments, &quot;Monuments de la francophonie d&#x27;Ottawa&quot; was designed by Edward J. Cuhaci, and represents the first homes and the founding of Bytown. The next five monuments, each progressing uphill, highlight business achievements that were crucial to the prosperity of Ottawa economy. The seventh monument, an unfinished granite block, symbolizes future developments. 

A monument to Franco-Ontarians also exists at Queen&#x27;s Park in Toronto. The &quot;Notre Place&quot; monument commemorates the Franco-Ontarian community as well as the contributions the francophone community made to Ontario. The monument was first proposed in 2015. Work on the monument began on 25 September 2017, on Franco-Ontarian day, and was unveiled on the same day the following year. The stainless steel columns were designed to commemorate Franco-Ontarian contributions in the province&#x27;s forestry industry, while the surrounding public square was intended to be used as a gathering space. The name of the monument, &quot;Notre Place&quot;, is a reference to song from Paul Demers and François Dubé. The name of the monument, and the Franco-Ontarian flag is also present on the stoned wall bench that surrounds most of the square. Designed by the architectural firm Brooke McIlroy, the cost to construct the monument was approximate C$900,000.

===Arts===
====Film====
Through their proximity to Gatineau and Montreal, Ottawa and the communities east of it toward Montreal are the only regions in Ontario which have consistent access throughout the year to French-language theatrical films. However, Cinéfest in Sudbury and the Toronto International Film Festival include francophone films in their annual festival programs, the Toronto-based Cinéfranco festival programs a lineup consisting entirely of francophone films, and community groups in many smaller communities offer French film screenings from time to time, sometimes in conjunction with the Tournée Québec Cinéma touring program of Quebec films. Francophone films also air on TFO, Radio-Canada and cable channels such as Unis and Super Écran.

====Literature====

Ontario has seven francophone publishing companies, including Sudbury&#x27;s Prise de parole, Ottawa&#x27;s Editions Le Nordir and Les Éditions David.

Notable Franco-Ontarian writers, essayists and poets, include Lola Lemire Tostevin, Daniel Poliquin, Robert Dickson, Jean-Marc Dalpé, François Paré, Gaston Tremblay, Michel Bock, Doric Germain, Fernand Dorais, Hédi Bouraoui, Philippe Bernier Arcand, Andrée Christensen, Patrice Desbiens and Jean Éthier-Blais. The French-language scholar Joseph Médard Carrière was Franco-Ontarian.

====Music and theatre====

Nine professional theatre companies offer French language theatrical productions, including five companies in Ottawa (Théâtre du Trillium, Théâtre de la Vieille 17, Vox Théâtre, Théâtre la Catapulte and Créations In Vivo), one in Sudbury (Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario) and three in Toronto (Théâtre Corpus, Théâtre La Tangente and Théâtre français de Toronto). There are also numerous community theatre groups and school theatre groups.

Annual music festivals include La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang in Sudbury and the Festival Franco-Ontarien in Ottawa. Notable figures in Franco-Ontarian music include Robert Paquette, Marcel Aymar, En Bref, Chuck Labelle, Les Chaizes Muzikales, Brasse-Camarade, Swing, Konflit Dramatik, Stéphane Paquette, Damien Robitaille and CANO.

The song &quot;Notre Place&quot; by Paul Demers and François Dubé, long considered an unofficial anthem of the Franco-Ontarian community after it was written for a gala to celebrate the passage of the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; in 1986, was legally designated as the community&#x27;s official anthem by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 2017.

Place des Arts, a multidisciplinary arts centre bringing together many of the francophone arts and culture organizations in Sudbury, opened in 2022.

====Visual arts====
La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario is an art museum whose collections and exhibitions are centred around Franco-Ontarian artists.

===Media===
==== Print ====
Ontario had one francophone daily newspaper, &quot;Le Droit&quot; in Ottawa; due to the increasingly challenging business environment for print newspapers, it moved across the river to Gatineau in 2019 to take advantage of Quebec government funding assistance, but continues to cover Ottawa-related news.

Several other communities in Ontario are served by francophone community weekly papers, including &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; and &quot;Le Métropolitain&quot; in Toronto, &quot;Le Voyageur&quot; in Sudbury, &quot;L&#x27;Action&quot; in London/Sarnia, &quot;Le Rempart&quot; in Windsor, &quot;Le Régional&quot; in Hamilton-Niagara and &quot;Le Journal de Cornwall&quot; in Cornwall. 

Important historical publications include Ottawa&#x27;s &quot;Le Progrès&quot;, which was launched in 1858 as the province&#x27;s first francophone newspaper, and Sudbury&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot;, which was published from 1942 to 1968.

====Radio====
On radio, the Franco-Ontarian community is served primarily by Radio-Canada&#x27;s Ici Radio-Canada Première network, which has originating stations in Ottawa (CBOF), Toronto (CJBC), Sudbury (CBON) and Windsor (CBEF), with rebroadcasters throughout Ontario. &quot;Ici Musique&quot;, Radio-Canada&#x27;s arts and culture network, currently broadcasts only in Ottawa (CBOX), Toronto (CJBC-FM), Sudbury (CBBX), Kitchener-Waterloo (CJBC-FM-1) and Windsor (CJBC-FM-2), with an additional transmitter licensed but not yet launched in Timmins.

Non-profit francophone community stations exist in several communities, including Penetanguishene (CFRH), Hearst (CINN), Kapuskasing (CKGN), Cornwall (CHOD), Ottawa (CJFO) and Toronto (CHOQ). Many campus radio stations air one or two hours per week of French-language programming as well, although only CHUO at the University of Ottawa and CKLU at Laurentian University are officially bilingual stations.

Francophone commercial radio stations exist in Sudbury (CHYC), Timmins (CHYK) and Sturgeon Falls/North Bay (CHYQ); all three stations are owned and operated by Le5 Communications, and air distinct locally targeted morning shows while operating for the remainder of the day as a shared region-wide simulcast with each station originating some of the common programming. Ottawa francophones are served by the commercial radio stations licensed to Gatineau, and many other Eastern Ontario communities are within the broadcast range of the Gatineau and Montreal media markets. One station in Hawkesbury (CHPR) airs a few hours per week of locally oriented programming, but otherwise simulcasts a commercial station from Montreal.

====Television====

The province has two Ici Radio-Canada Télé stations, CBOFT-DT in Ottawa and CBLFT-DT in Toronto, which previously had rebroadcast transmitters throughout the province but remain available provincewide on basic cable. Both stations carry identical programming directed from Radio-Canada&#x27;s master control in Montreal, except for local news and advertisements. CBOFT produces a newscast for broadcast only in the Ottawa area, while CBLFT produces another serving the rest of the province. The network formerly also operated CBEFT in Windsor, which was shut down in 2012.

The provincial government operates TFO, a sister channel to TVOntario, which is available provincewide via mandatory carriage on basic cable or satellite packages and via online streaming; it formerly also transmitted over the air in selected communities with significant francophone populations, but this was discontinued in 2012. In 2003, TFO produced and aired &quot;Francoeur&quot;, the first Franco-Ontarian &quot;téléroman&quot;. In 2008, TFO also began airing the first Franco-Ontarian sitcom, &quot;Météo+&quot; — itself, in part, a satire of the Franco-Ontarian community&#x27;s relative lack of access to local French-language media. In 2012, the production team behind &quot;Météo+&quot; launched &quot;Les Bleus de Ramville&quot;.

The Quebec-based francophone network TVA as well as specialty channels TV5 Québec Canada and Ici RDI are available on all Ontario cable systems, as these channels are mandated by the CRTC for carriage by all Canadian cable operators. Where there is sufficient local demand for French-language television, Ontario cable systems may also offer French-language channels such as Noovo, Ici ARTV, Elle Fictions and RDS, although these channels only have discretionary status outside Quebec and are typically offered only on a digital cable tier rather than in basic cable packages.

<text>In playing cards, a suit is one of the categories into which the cards of a deck are divided. Most often, each card bears one of several pips (symbols) showing to which suit it belongs; the suit may alternatively or additionally be indicated by the color printed on the card. The rank for each card is determined by the number of pips on it, except on face cards. Ranking indicates which cards within a suit are better, higher or more valuable than others, whereas there is no order between the suits unless defined in the rules of a specific card game. In most decks, there is exactly one card of any given rank in any given suit. A deck may include special cards that belong to no suit, often called jokers.

While English-speaking countries traditionally use cards with the French suits of Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds, many other countries have their own traditional suits. Much of central Europe uses German suited cards with suits of Acorns (Clubs), Leaves (Spades), Hearts (Hearts) and Bells (Diamonds); Spain and parts of Italy and South America use Spanish suited cards with their suits of Swords (Spades), Batons (Clubs), Cups (Hearts) and Coins (Diamonds); German Switzerland uses Swiss suited cards with Acorns (Clubs), Shields (Hearts), yellow Roses (Spades) and Bells (Diamonds); and many parts of Italy use Italian suited cards which have the same suits but different patterns compared with Spanish suited cards. Asian countries such as China and Japan also have their own traditional suits. Tarot card packs have a set of distinct picture cards alongside the traditional four suits.

==History==
Modern Western playing cards are generally divided into two or three general suit-systems. The older Latin suits are subdivided into the Italian and Spanish suit-systems. The younger Germanic suits are subdivided into the German and Swiss suit-systems. The French suits are a derivative of the German suits but are generally considered a separate system.

===Origin and development of the Latin suits===

The earliest card games were trick-taking games and the invention of suits increased the level of strategy and depth in these games. A card of one suit cannot beat a card from another regardless of its rank. The concept of suits predates playing cards and can be found in Chinese dice and domino games such as Tien Gow.

Chinese money-suited cards are believed to be the oldest ancestor to the Latin suit system. The money-suit system is based on denominations of currency: Coins, Strings of Coins, Myriads of Strings (or of coins), and Tens of Myriads. Old Chinese coins had holes in the middle to allow them to be strung together. A string of coins could easily be misinterpreted as a stick to those unfamiliar with them.

By then the Islamic world had spread into Central Asia and had contacted China, and had adopted playing cards. The Muslims renamed the suit of myriads as cups; this may have been due to seeing a Chinese character for &quot;myriad&quot; () upside-down. The Chinese numeral character for Ten () on the Tens of Myriads suit may have inspired the Muslim suit of swords. Another clue linking these Chinese, Muslim, and European cards are the ranking of certain suits. In many early Chinese games like Madiao, the suit of coins was in reverse order so that the lower ones beat the higher ones. In the Indo-Persian game of Ganjifa, half the suits were also inverted, including a suit of coins. This was also true for the European games of Tarot and Ombre. The inverting of suits had no purpose in terms of play but was an artifact from the earliest games.

These Turko-Arabic cards, called Kanjifa, used the suits coins, clubs, cups, and swords, but the clubs represented polo sticks; Europeans changed that suit, as polo was an obscure sport to them.

The Latin suits are coins, clubs, cups, and swords. They are the earliest suit-system in Europe, and were adopted from the cards imported from Mamluk Egypt and Moorish Granada in the 1370s.

There are four types of Latin suits: Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and an extinct archaic type. The systems can be distinguished by the pips of their long suits: swords and clubs.
* Northern Italian swords are curved outward and the clubs appear to be batons. They intersect one another.
* Southern Italian and Spanish swords are straight, and the clubs appear to be knobbly cudgels. They do not cross each other (The common exception being the three of clubs).
* Portuguese pips are like the Spanish, but they intersect like Northern Italian ones. They sometimes have dragons on the aces. This system lingers on only in the Tarocco Siciliano and the Unsun Karuta and Komatsufuda of Japan. Unsun Karuta additionally has a fifth Guru suit (circular whirls).
* The archaic system is like the Northern Italian one, but the swords are curved inward so they touch each other without intersecting.
* Minchiate (a game that used a 97-card deck) used a mixed system of Italian clubs and Portuguese swords.

Despite a long history of trade with China, Japan was not introduced to playing cards until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1540s. Early locally made cards, Karuta, were very similar to Portuguese decks. Increasing restrictions by the Tokugawa shogunate on gambling, card playing, and general foreign influence, resulted in the Hanafuda deck that today is used most often for fishing-type games and the Komatsufuda and Kabufuda decks that are used for gambling. In hanafuda, the role of rank and suit in organizing cards became switched, so the deck has 12 suits, each representing a month of the year, and each suit has 4 cards, most often two normal, one Ribbon and one Special (though August, November and December each differ uniquely from this convention). In komatsufuda and kabufuda, the designs of the suits became much more abstract. The latter much moreso to the point where the suit does not matter (only rank) and the face cards indistinguishable; thus becoming a single-suited deck with ranks 1-10 and the designs quadruplicated. Unsun karuta did not face the same restrictions and instead developed an additional suit and additional ranks.

===Invention of German and French suits===

During the 15th-century, manufacturers in German speaking lands experimented with various new suit systems to replace the Latin suits. One early deck had five suits, the Latin ones with an extra suit of shields. The Swiss-Germans developed their own suits of shields, roses, acorns, and bells around 1450. Instead of roses and shields, the Germans settled with hearts and leaves around 1460. The French derived their suits of &quot;trèfles&quot; (clovers or clubs ), &quot;carreaux&quot; (tiles or diamonds ), &quot;cœurs&quot; (hearts ), and &quot;piques&quot; (pikes or spades ) from the German suits around 1480. French suits correspond closely with German suits with the exception of the tiles with the bells but there is one early French deck that had crescents instead of tiles. The English names for the French suits of clubs and spades may simply have been carried over from the older Latin suits.

===Tarot cards===
Beginning around 1440 in northern Italy, some decks started to include an extra suit of (usually) 21 numbered cards known as trionfi or trumps, to play tarot card games. Always included in tarot decks is one card, the Fool or Excuse, which may be part of the trump suit depending on the game or region. These cards do not have pips or face cards like the other suits. Most tarot decks used for games come with French suits but Italian suits are still used in Piedmont, Bologna, and pockets of Switzerland. A few Sicilian towns use the Portuguese-suited Tarocco Siciliano, the only deck of its kind left in Europe.

The esoteric use of Tarot packs emerged in France in the late 18th century, since when special packs intended for divination have been produced. These typically have the suits cups, pentacles (based on the suit of coins), wands (based on the suit of batons), and swords. The trump cards and Fool of traditional card playing packs were named the Major Arcana; the remaining cards, often embellished with occult images, were the Minor Arcana. Neither term is recognised by card players.

== Suits ==
=== Symbolic origin ===
In divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot, the Minor Arcana, and the suits by extension, are believed to represent relatively mundane features of life. The court cards may represent the people whom one meets.

Each suit also has distinctive characteristics and connotations commonly held to be as follows:

=== Comparisons between suits ===

==Suits in games with traditional decks==
===Trumps===
In a large and popular category of trick-taking games, one suit may be designated in each deal to be &quot;trump&quot; and all cards of the trump suit rank above all non-trump cards, and automatically prevail over them, losing only to a higher trump if one is played to the same trick. Non-trump suits are called plain suits.

===Special suits===
Some games treat one or more suits as being special or different from the others. A simple example is Spades, which uses spades as a permanent trump suit. A less simple example is Hearts, which is a kind of point trick game in which the object is to avoid taking tricks containing hearts. With typical rules for Hearts (rules vary slightly) the queen of spades and the two of clubs (sometimes also the jack of diamonds) have special effects, with the result that all four suits have different strategic value. Tarot decks have a dedicated trump suit.

=== Chosen suits ===
Games of the Karnöffel Group have between one and four chosen suits, sometimes called selected suits or, misleadingly, trump suits. The chosen suits are typified by having a disrupted ranking and cards with varying privileges which may range from full to none and which may depend on the order they are played to the trick. For example, chosen Sevens may be unbeatable when led, but otherwise worthless. In Swedish Bräus some cards are even unplayable. In games where the number of chosen suits is less than four, the others are called unchosen suits and usually rank in their natural order.

===Ranking of suits===
Whist-style rules generally preclude the necessity of determining which of two cards of different suits has higher rank, because a card played on a card of a different suit either automatically wins or automatically loses depending on whether the new card is a trump. However, some card games also need to define relative suit rank. An example of this is in auction games such as bridge, where if one player wishes to bid to make some number of heart tricks and another to make the same number of diamond tricks, there must be a mechanism to determine which takes precedence in the bidding order.

There is no standard order for the four suits and so there are differing conventions among games that need a suit hierarchy. Examples of suit order are (from highest to lowest):
===Pairing or ignoring suits===
The pairing of suits is a vestigial remnant of Ganjifa, a game where half the suits were in reverse order, the lower cards beating the higher. In Ganjifa, progressive suits were called &quot;strong&quot; while inverted suits were called &quot;weak&quot;. In Latin decks, the traditional division is between the long suits of swords and clubs and the round suits of cups and coins. This pairing can be seen in Ombre and Tarot card games. German and Swiss suits lack pairing but French suits maintained them and this can be seen in the game of Spoil Five.

In some games, such as blackjack, suits are ignored. In other games, such as Canasta, only the color (red or black) is relevant. In yet others, such as bridge, each of the suit pairings are distinguished.

In contract bridge, there are three ways to divide four suits into pairs: by &quot;color&quot;, by &quot;rank&quot; and by &quot;shape&quot; resulting in six possible suit combinations.
* Color is used to denote the &quot;red&quot; suits (hearts and diamonds) and the &quot;black&quot; suits (spades and clubs).
* Rank is used to indicate the &quot;major&quot; (spades and hearts) versus &quot;minor&quot; (diamonds and clubs) suits.
* Shape is used to denote the &quot;pointed&quot; (diamonds and spades, which visually have a sharp point uppermost) versus &quot;rounded&quot; (hearts and clubs) suits. This is used in bridge as a mnemonic.

===Four-color suits===

Some decks, while using the French suits, give each suit a different color to make the suits more distinct from each other. In bridge, such decks are known as &quot;no-revoke&quot; decks, and the most common colors are black spades, red hearts, blue diamonds and green clubs, although in the past the diamond suit usually appeared in a golden yellow-orange. A pack occasionally used in Germany uses green spades (comparable to leaves), red hearts, yellow diamonds (comparable to bells) and black clubs (comparable to acorns). This is a compromise deck devised to allow players from East Germany (who used German suits) and West Germany (who adopted the French suits) to be comfortable with the same deck when playing tournament Skat after the German reunification.

==Other suited decks==

===Swiss-German Experimental Suit Systems===
This is a list of suit systems devised by early Swiss-German cardmakers mentioned by Michael Dummett:

Other suit systems:

===Suited-and-ranked decks===
A large number of games are based around a deck in which each card has a rank and a suit (usually represented by a color), and for each suit there is exactly one card having each rank, though in many cases the deck has various special cards as well.

===Other modern decks===
Decks for some games are divided into suits, but otherwise bear little relation to traditional games. An example would be the board game Taj Mahal, in which each card has one of four background colors, the rule being that all the cards played by a single player in a single round must be the same color. The selection of cards in the deck of each color is approximately the same and the player&#x27;s choice of which color to use is guided by the contents of their particular hand.

In the trick-taking card game &quot;Flaschenteufel&quot; (&quot;The Bottle Imp&quot;), all cards are part of a single sequence ranked from 1 to 37 but split into three suits depending on its rank. players must follow the suit led, but if they are void in that suit they may play a card of another suit &quot;and this can still win the trick if its rank is high enough&quot;. For this reason every card in the deck has a different number to prevent ties. A further strategic element is introduced since one suit contains mostly low-ranking cards and another, mostly high-ranking cards.

Whereas cards in a traditional deck have two classifications—suit and rank—and each combination is represented by one card, giving for example &quot;4 suits × 13 ranks = 52 cards&quot;, each card in a Set deck has four classifications each into one of three categories, giving a total of &quot;3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81&quot; cards. Any one of these four classifications could be considered a &quot;suit&quot;, but this is not really enlightening in terms of the structure of the game.

==Uses of playing card suit symbols==
Card suit symbols occur in places outside card playing:
* The four suits were famously employed by the United States&#x27; 101st Airborne Division during World War II to distinguish its four constituent regiments:
**Clubs (♣) identified the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment; currently worn by the 1st Brigade Combat Team.
**Diamonds (♦) identified the 501st PIR. 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment is now part of the 4th Brigade (ABN), 25th Infantry Division in Alaska; the Diamond is currently used by the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade.
**Hearts (♥) identified the 502nd PIR; currently worn by the 2nd Brigade Combat Team.
**Spades (♠) identified the 506th PIR; currently worn by the 4th Brigade Combat Team.

== Character encodings ==

In computer and other digital media, suit symbols can be represented with character encoding, notably in the ISO and Unicode standards, or with Web standard (SGML&#x27;s named entity syntax):
Unicode is the most frequently used encoding standard, and suits are in the Miscellaneous Symbols Block (2600–26FF) of the Unicode.

==Metaphorical uses==
In some card games the card suits have a dominance order, for example: club (lowest) - diamond - heart - spade (highest). That led to &quot;in spades&quot; being used to mean &quot;more than expected, in abundance, very much&quot;.

Other expressions drawn from bridge and similar games include &quot;strong suit&quot; (any area of personal strength) and &quot;to follow suit&quot; (to imitate another&#x27;s actions).

<text>ProQuest LLC is an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based global information-content and technology company, founded in 1938 as University Microfilms by Eugene Power.

ProQuest is known for its applications and information services for libraries, providing access to dissertations, theses, ebooks, newspapers, periodicals, historical collections, governmental archives, cultural archives, and other aggregated databases. This content was estimated to be around 125 billion digital pages.

The company began operations as a producer of microfilm products, subsequently shifting to electronic publishing, and later grew through acquisitions. On December 1, 2021, Clarivate bought ProQuest from Cambridge Information Group for $5.3 billion in what was described as &quot;huge deal in the library and information publishing world&quot;. Clarivate said that the operational concept behind the acquisition was integrating ProQuest&#x27;s products and applications with Web of Science.

==Businesses==
ProQuest was founded as a microfilm publisher. It began publishing doctoral dissertations in 1939, has published more than 3 million searchable dissertations and theses, and is designated as an offsite digital archive for the United States Library of Congress. The company&#x27;s scholarly content includes dissertations and theses, primary source material, ebooks, scholarly journals, historical and current newspapers and periodicals, data sources, and other content of interest to researchers. ProQuest Video Preservation and Discovery Service, allows libraries to preserve and provide access to their proprietary audio and video collections.

In May 2014, ProQuest LLC also operated businesses under the following names:

*Bowker provides bibliographic information management solutions to publishers, libraries and booksellers, and is the ISBN Agency for the United States.
*Dialog is an online information service with more than 1.4 billion unique records curated for corporate, business and government researchers, with a focus on pharmaceutical, engineering and patent research.
*EBL (Ebook Library), an ebook aggregator with a catalog of titles from academic publishers, serves academic, corporate and research libraries while supporting emerging collection development models such as patron-driven acquisition.
*ebrary offers access to ebook collections, by subscription or a perpetual archive model, in subject packages tailored for academic, corporate, government, public and high school libraries.

==History==
Eugene Power, a 1927 BA and 1930 MBA graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the company as University Microfilms in 1938, preserving works from the British Museum on microfilm. By June 1938, Power worked in two rented rooms from a downtown Ann Arbor funeral parlor, specializing in microphotography to preserve library collections. In his autobiography &quot;Edition of One&quot;, Power details the development of the company, including how University Microfilms assisted the OSS during World War II. This work mainly involved filming maps and European newspapers so they could be shipped back and forth overseas more cheaply and discreetly.

Power also noticed a niche market in dissertations publishing. Students were often forced to publish their own works in order to finish their doctoral degree. Dissertations could be published more cheaply as microfilm than as books. ProQuest still publishes so many dissertations that its Dissertations and Theses collection (formerly called Digital Dissertations) has been declared the official U.S. off-site repository of the Library of Congress.

The idea of universal adoption of microfilm publication of doctoral dissertations was furthered considerably by two articles researched and written by a then recent recipient of the doctorate in history at Stanford University. Vaughn Davis Bornet seized on the idea and published &quot;Doctoral Dissertations and the Stream of Scholarship&quot; and &quot;Microfilm Publication of Doctoral Dissertations&quot;.

As the dissertations market grew, the company expanded into filming newspapers and periodicals. The company&#x27;s main newspaper database is ProQuest Newsstand.

In 1962, Xerox acquired the company for 51,750 shares of Xerox common stock, worth about $7.9 million. Under Xerox&#x27;s ownership, the name of the company changed several times, from University Microfilms to Xerox University Microfilms, to University Microfilms International, then shortened to UMI. In 1985, it was purchased from Xerox by Bell &amp; Howell. In 1986, UMI acquired Data Courier, owner of ABI/INFORM, from the Bingham family.

In the 1980s, UMI began producing CD-ROMs that stored databases of periodicals abstracts and indexes. At a time when modem connections were slow and expensive, it was more efficient to mail database CD-ROMs regularly to subscribing libraries, who installed the discs on dedicated PCs. The ProQuest brand name was first used for databases on CD-ROM. An online service called ProQuest Direct was launched in 1995; its name was later shortened to just ProQuest. The bibliographic databases are mainly sold to schools, universities and libraries.

In 1998, the company announced the &quot;Digital Vault Initiative&quot;, purported to include 5.5 billion images digitized from UMI microfilm, including some of the best existing copies of major newspapers dating back 100 to 150 years, and Early English books dating back to the 15th century. While work continues to digitize the contents of the microfilm vault, ProQuest is already providing navigation of 125 billion digital pages, including nearly 20 million pages of newspaper content dating from pre-Revolutionary War America.

In 1999, the company name changed to Bell &amp; Howell Information and Learning, and then in 2001 to ProQuest Information and Learning; Bell &amp; Howell renamed itself the ProQuest Company.

Also in 1999, the company acquired Chadwyck-Healey, a one-time microfilm publishing company that was one of the first to produce full-text CD-ROM databases. This acquisition gave Proquest ownership of a 100+ person publishing operation based in Cambridge, England and became the basis for a substantial overseas expansion.

During the 2000–2004 fiscal years, as well as the first three quarters of the 2005 fiscal year, ProQuest systematically overstated its net income. Cumulatively, pre-tax profits were overstated by 129.9 million dollars (or about 31 percent). In 2008, Voyager Learning Company and ProQuest&#x27;s CFO (from the time of the earnings overstatements) settled SEC &quot;charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC&#x27;s complaint&quot;.

In 2001 ProQuest acquired Norman Ross Publishing, a small New York based microfilm publisher.

In 2002 ProQuest acquired bigchalk.com, a company founded in 1999 with the combined assets of ProQuest&#x27;s K-12 division and Infonautics Inc.&#x27;s K-12 business.

In 2004, ProQuest Information and Learning acquired Seattle start-up Serials Solutions, a venture providing access management and search services for content hosted by other companies.

Also in 2004, the company acquired Copley Publishing Group.

In 2005 three ProQuest executives formed a distribution company called National Archive Publishing Co, of XanEdu, UMI, and Digital Service Operations. The building that would house this new company stood at 300 Zeeb Road in Scio, home to nearly 6 billion pages of information.

In 2006, ProQuest Company, then the parent company of ProQuest Information and Learning, sold it to Cambridge Information Group, owner of R. R. Bowker. From the time of this sale, this article follows the history of ProQuest Information and Learning, not ProQuest Company. (ProQuest Company subsequently renamed itself to Voyager Learning Company, and later became part of Cambium Learning Group.)

In 2007, ProQuest Information and Learning was merged with CSA to form ProQuest CSA. Later that year it was renamed ProQuest LLC.

In 2008, ProQuest LLC acquired complete ownership of RefWorks, a web-based citation manager of which it had been part owner since 2001. RefWorks was merged with ProQuest&#x27;s existing COS business to form RefWorks/COS.

Also in 2008, ProQuest acquired Dialog, a major online database firm, from Thomson Reuters.

In 2010, ProQuest acquired two properties from LexisNexis, the Congressional Information Service (CIS) and University Publications of America (UPA). CIS produced one of the world&#x27;s most exhaustive online collections of legislative content and highly respected statistical works, while UPA included deep historical content sets. The acquisition included digital products and an expansive microfilm vault that would leverage ProQuest&#x27;s strength in conversion from film to searchable electronic formats.

In 2011, ProQuest acquired Ebrary, an online digital library of full texts of over 170,000 scholarly e-books. In 2013, ProQuest acquired Ebook Library (EBL), with plans to combine ebrary and EBL into a single e-book platform.
In 2014, ProQuest acquired Pi2 Solutions, a privately owned company specializing in Drug Safety Triager (DST) &amp; Product Literature Database (PLD) systems for the biopharmaceutical industry. The company aligned Pi2 Solutions with its ProQuest Dialog corporate information service.

In 2015, ProQuest acquired SiPX and Coutts Information Services, including the MyiLibrary platform and the Online Acquisitions and Selection Information System (OASIS).

In October 2015, ProQuest acquired Ex Libris. It was to merge the Workflow Solutions division of ProQuest, which included the former Serials Solutions, into Ex Libris, with the enlarged entity to be named &quot;Ex Libris, a ProQuest Company&quot;.

In June 2016, ProQuest acquired Alexander Street Press, a provider of streaming videos and ebooks.

In January 2020, ProQuest acquired Innovative Interfaces, Inc., a provider of technology solutions to academic and public libraries.

On 17 May 2021, it was announced that Clarivate would acquire ProQuest. On July 28, 2021, Clarivate announced that the acquisition was delayed due to a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe. On December 1, 2021, Clarivate successfully completed the acquisition of ProQuest.

<doc id="218675" wikidata="Q604922" url="?curid=218675" title="Death in the Clouds">
<text>Death in the Clouds is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, published in 1935. It features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and Chief Inspector Japp. It is a &quot;closed circle&quot; murder mystery: the victim is a passenger on a cross-Channel aircraft flight, and the perpetrator can only be one of eleven fellow-passengers and crew.

The book was first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company on 10 March 1935 under the title of Death in the Air and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in July of the same year under Christie&#x27;s original title. The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).

==Plot summary==
Hercule Poirot travels back to England on the midday flight from Le Bourget Airfield in Paris to Croydon Airport in London. He is one of eleven passengers in the plane&#x27;s rear compartment. The others include mystery writer Daniel Clancy; French archaeologists Armand Dupont and his son Jean; dentist Norman Gale; Doctor Bryant; French moneylender Madame Giselle; businessman James Ryder; Cicely, Countess of Horbury; the Honourable Venetia Kerr; and Jane Grey, a hairdresser. As the plane is close to landing, a wasp is spotted flying around the rear compartment before a steward finds that Giselle is dead. Poirot, who has slept through most of the flight, dismisses the belief she died from a wasp sting. Instead, he points out a dart on the floor, which is found to have a poisoned tip: Giselle was stung in the neck with it. The question remains how she was murdered without anyone noticing.

The police find a small blowpipe in the side of Poirot&#x27;s seat. Annoyed at being identified as a suspect, he vows to clear his name and solve the case. Requesting a list of the passengers&#x27; possessions, he notes something that intrigues him but doesn&#x27;t say what it is or to which passenger it refers. Aided by Jane in the investigation, Poirot works with Inspector Japp in England and Inspector Fournier in France. Clues gradually emerge: the victim had two coffee spoons with her cup and saucer; the blowpipe was bought in Paris by an American man; Lady Horbury is one of Giselle&#x27;s debtors, and had been cut off from her husband&#x27;s money; Giselle employed blackmail to ensure that her debtors didn&#x27;t miss their repayments; only the stewards and Clancy passed by the victim on the flight; Lady Horbury&#x27;s maid was on the flight after asking to be on it at the last moment.

Poirot pursues his enquiries in both London and Paris. On a flight to Paris, he conducts an experiment that shows that the use of the blowpipe, or anything similar, would have been noticed by the other passengers. It subsequently emerges that Giselle has an estranged daughter, Anne Morisot, who now stands to inherit her fortune. Poirot meets Anne and learns that she has an American or Canadian husband, whom she married a month earlier. Poirot afterwards comments that he feels that he has seen Anne before. When Jane makes a remark about needing to file a nail, he realises that Anne was Lady Horbury&#x27;s maid Madeleine – he had seen her come into the rear compartment during the flight when Lady Horbury summoned her to fetch a dressing-case. He immediately instructs Fournier to find Anne. French police discover her body on the boat-train to Boulogne, with a bottle beside it; she appears to have poisoned herself.

Poirot makes his dénouement of the case in the presence of Japp, Gale, and Clancy. Giselle&#x27;s killer was Norman Gale, who sought her fortune. The murder was carefully planned: Gale had brought his dentist&#x27;s coat on the flight, which he changed into after some time to pose as a steward, knowing no-one would pay attention to such a person. Under the guise of delivering a spoon to Giselle, he stabbed her with the dart, then removed his coat and returned to his seat before the body was found. Anne&#x27;s murder was part of the plan – Gale married her when he learned she was Giselle&#x27;s daughter, intending to kill her at a later date in Canada, after she had received her mother&#x27;s estate, and having ensured that he would in turn inherit the money from her. However, he had to kill her earlier than planned because she claimed her inheritance on the same day that Poirot met her.

The wasp that buzzed around in the rear compartment was released from a matchbox that Gale brought with him; both this and his coat had aroused Poirot&#x27;s suspicions when he read the list of passengers&#x27; possessions. Both the wasp and the blowpipe, which Gale planted in the cabin, were intended to mislead. Gale denies Poirot&#x27;s theory, but after Poirot lies to him about the police finding his fingerprints on the bottle that contained the poison, he inadvertently lets slip that he wore gloves in Anne&#x27;s murder. Gale is arrested. Afterwards, Poirot pairs off Jane with Jean Dupont, who had fallen in love with her during the case.

==Reception==
&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 4 July 1935 summarized thus: &quot;Any of the other nine passengers and two stewards could be suspected. And all of them were, including Clancy, the writer of detective stories, whom the author evidently enjoys making absurd. It will be a very acute reader who does not receive a complete surprise at the end.&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; in its main paper gave the book a second review in its issue of 2 July 1935 when they described its plot as &quot;ingenious&quot; and commented on the fact that Christie had evolved a method of presenting a crime in a confined space (with reference to &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;) which &quot;however often employed, never loses its originality.&quot;

Isaac Anderson in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 24 March 1935 began his column:
In &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s issue of 30 June 1935, &quot;Torquemada&quot; (Edward Powys Mathers) started his review, &quot;My admiration for Mrs. Christie is such that with each new book of hers I strain every mental nerve to prove that she has failed, at last, to hypnotize me. On finishing &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot;, I found that she had succeeded even more triumphantly than usual.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I hope that some readers of this baffling case will foresee at least the &quot;false&quot; denouement. I did not even do that. Agatha Christie has recently developed two further tricks: one is, as of the juggler who keeps on dropping things, to leave a clue hanging out for several chapters, apparently unremarked by her little detective though seized on by us, and then to tuck it back again as unimportant. Another is to give us some, but by no means all, of the hidden thoughts of her characters. We readers must guard against these new dexterities. As for Poirot, it is only to him and to Cleopatra that a certain remark about age and custom is strictly applicable. But might not Inspector Japp be allowed to mellow a little, with the years, beyond the moron stage?&quot;

An admirer of Christie, Milward Kennedy of &quot;The Guardian&quot; began his review of 30 July 1935, &quot;Very few authors achieve the ideal blend of puzzle and entertainment as often does Agatha Christie.&quot; He did admit that, &quot;&quot;Death in the Clouds&quot; may not rank with her greatest achievements, but it is far above the average detective story.&quot; He finished by saying, &quot;Mrs Christie provides a little gallery of thumb-nail sketches of plausible characters; she gives us all the clues and even tells us where to look for them; we ought to find the murderer by reason, but are not likely to succeed except by guesswork.&quot;

A review in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; of 20 July 1935 concluded, &quot;We leave Poirot to figure it all out. He is at it and in it, with his usual brilliance, till the end.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;Exceptionally lively specimen, with wider than usual class and type-range of suspects. Scrupulously fair, with each clue presented openly and discussed. Note Clancy the crime writer, and the superiority of French police to British (no signs of insularity here).&quot;

==References or allusions==

===References to other works===
*In Chapter 6, Monsieur Fournier makes reference to Monsieur Giraud, the French detective whom Poirot meets in &quot;Murder on the Links&quot;.
*In Chapter 7, Poirot refers to a case of poisoning in which the killer uses a &quot;psychological&quot; moment to his advantage, an allusion to &quot;Three Act Tragedy&quot;.
*In Chapter 21, Poirot refers to a case in which all the suspects were lying, an allusion to &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;.

===References in other works===
*In Chapter 12 of a later Poirot novel, &quot;Mrs McGinty&#x27;s Dead&quot; (1952), Christie&#x27;s alter ego, Ariadne Oliver, refers to a novel of hers in which she made a blowpipe one foot long, only to be told later that they were six feet long. This was a belated but sly and self-referential acknowledgement of a fundamental error in the plot of &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot;.

===Allusions to real life===
*An event experienced by Christie herself, shortly after her second marriage (to Sir Max Mallowan), and described in her &quot;Autobiography&quot;, is alluded to in Chapter 13. &quot;Imagine, in a little hotel in Syria was an Englishman whose wife had been taken ill. He himself had to be somewhere in Iraq by a certain date. Eh bien, would you believe it, he left his wife and went on so as to be on duty in time? And both he and his wife thought that quite natural; they thought him noble, unselfish. But the doctor, who was not English, thought him a barbarian.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Television===
====British live-action adaptation====
The novel was adapted as an episode for the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, in 1992. It starred David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, and Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector James Japp. Although the adaptation remained largely faithful to most of the novel&#x27;s plot, it featured a number of changes:

* The characters of Dr Bryant, James Ryder and Armand Dupont are omitted from the adaptation; Jean Dupont is the only archaeologist on the flight.
* The aircraft is a slightly anachronistic Douglas DC-3, instead of a Handley Page H.P.42 as described in the novel. The DC3 first flew in December 1935, the novel is set in June 1935 (Poirot watches Fred Perry winning the French Championships). All H.P.42s had been destroyed by 1940, and the still-flying DC3 used in the production, registration G-AMRA, was built in 1944.
* Poirot is assisted by Japp throughout the investigation; he comes with him to investigate the case in France. Inspector Fournier is given a lesser role as a result.
* The details of some of the characters are modified:
** Jane Grey is an air stewardess on the flight. Although she works with Poirot on the case, she is not matched up with anyone at its conclusion.
** Daniel Clancy suffers from a mental malady, in which he believe his fictional detective has a control on his life. He attends the denouement mainly to learn who the killer is, rather than witnessing a real-life detective at work.
** Venetia Kerr and Poirot do not change seats on the flight.
** Anne Morisot (a.k.a. Madeleine) has married Gale in Paris, not Rotterdam.
**Armand Dupont is dead for two years.
* Poirot meets some of the suspects at a tennis match he attends in Paris, by invitation of Jane.

====Japanese animated adaptation====
It was later adapted as the final 4 episodes of the Japanese animated television series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Great Detectives Poirot and Marple&quot;, airing in 2005.

===Radio===
The novel was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4 in 2003, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot, Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector Japp (as in the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; adaptation), Geoffrey Whitehead as Monsieur Fournier, and Teresa Gallagher as Jane Grey.

==In popular culture==
* The novel is referenced notably in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Unicorn and the Wasp&quot;, which featured both the Doctor and Donna meeting Agatha Christie in the year 1926, and investigating a series of murders alongside her that were inspired by her novels to that date, committed by a giant, alien wasp. The Doctor notably remarks towards the end of the episode, that although Christie&#x27;s memories of the events were erased after the wasp&#x27;s death, she recalled them in such a way, that they later inspired her to write &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot; with the inclusion of a wasp as part of its plot. The book cover shown in the episode is one of the 1974 Fontana Books edition.

<doc id="218676" wikidata="Q563283" url="?curid=218676" title="Gaius Asinius Quadratus">
<text>Gaius Asinius Quadratus () (fl. AD 248) was a Greek historian of Rome and Parthia of the third century. He was a senator who wrote a 15-book history of Rome, &quot;Chilieteris&quot; (&quot;The Millennium&quot;), which, according to the Suda, covered the period from the founding of Rome until the rule of Alexander Severus. He also wrote a &quot;Parthika&quot; in nine books, presumably a narrative of the Parthian campaigns of the preceding century. Some scholars attribute to him a &quot;Germanika&quot;, based on an excerpt preserved by Agathias, although this is debated.

Asinius is the &quot;nomen&quot; of the &quot;gens&quot; Asinia of ancient Rome. He was the son of Gaius Julius Asinius Quadratus, who was brother of Gaius Asinius Rufus (born &quot;circa&quot; 160). These brothers were sons of Gaius Asinius Nicomachus (born &quot;circa&quot; 135) and his wife and cousin Julia Quadratilla (born &quot;circa&quot; 145) (or perhaps Asinia Marcellina, descendant of the family of Gaius Asinius Pollio), and grandchildren of Gaius Asinius Rufus (&quot;circa&quot; 110 - after 136), a notable in Lydia in 134 and 135 who became a Roman senator in 136, and wife Julia.

It has been suggested that Quadratus is identical with a suffect consul of the Severan period, Gaius Asinius Protimus Quadratus.

The &quot;thousand years&quot; of Quadratus&#x27; title has been explained in various ways. Felix Jacoby argues that Quadratus unusually dated the founding of Rome to the first Olympiad in 776. Giuseppe Zecchini, though, claims that Quadratus used the traditional dating of the founding of Rome and intended the work to extend to 248, when Philip the Arab celebrated the first millennium, but that he died before its completion. Thirty fragments of his work remain, which have been published by Jacoby in the &quot;Fragmente der griechischen Historiker&quot;. Most of these derive from the dictionary of Stephanus of Byzantium.

<doc id="218677" wikidata="Q369806" url="?curid=218677" title="Yasunori Mitsuda">
<text>is a Japanese composer and musician. He is best known for his work in video games, primarily for the &quot;Chrono&quot;, &quot;Xeno&quot;, &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; franchises, among various others. Mitsuda began composing music for his own games in high school, later attending a music college in Tokyo. While still a student, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team.

Mitsuda joined Square upon graduation in 1992 and worked there as a sound effects designer for two years before telling Square&#x27;s vice president Hironobu Sakaguchi he would quit unless he could write music for their games. Shortly after, Sakaguchi assigned him to work on the soundtrack for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; (1995), whose music has since been cited as among the best in video games.

Mitsuda went on to compose for several other games at Square, including &quot;Xenogears&quot; (1998) and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; (1999). He left the company and became independent in 1998. In 2001, he respectively founded his own music production studio and record company, Procyon Studio and Sleigh Bells. Mitsuda has also worked on anime series, films, and television programs.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Mitsuda was born in Tokuyama, Japan, on January 21, 1972, and was raised in the Kumage District of Yamaguchi Prefecture. He took piano lessons beginning at the age of five, but was more interested in sports at the time and did not take music seriously, quitting by the age of six. For a while, he wanted to become a professional golfer. By high school, Mitsuda wanted to become a music composer, inspired by Vangelis&#x27; &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and Henry Mancini&#x27;s &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; film scores. He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one, which was a rare item at the time. He started to program computer games and compose music for them, as well as take more technically oriented classes.

After high school, Mitsuda decided to leave town and become independent. With encouragement from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school&#x27;s low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training both in and out of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team studying under composer Motoi Sakuraba. With his school term ending, Mitsuda saw an advertisement for sound production at Square in a copy of &quot;Famitsu&quot;. With no plans as to what he wanted to do after school, he applied for the position and joined the company in April 1992.

===Career===
Although his official job title was as a composer, Mitsuda found himself working more as a sound engineer. Over the next two years, he created sound effects for &quot;Hanjuku Hero&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, and &quot;Romancing SaGa 2&quot;. In 1994, realizing that he would never get a chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay, he gave Square&#x27;s vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, an ultimatum: let him compose, or he would quit. Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, telling him that &quot;after you finish it, maybe your salary will go up&quot;. Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game, in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release. Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score, frequently working until he passed out, and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game. He worked himself so hard that he developed stomach ulcers and had to be hospitalized, which led Uematsu to finish the remaining tracks for him.

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; proved a great success, and the soundtrack proved popular with fans. Mitsuda claims that it is his &quot;landmark&quot; title, which &quot;matured&quot; him. He attributes its success to folk and jazz music, rather than the &quot;semi-orchestral&quot; style popular in game music at the time. Following &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, Mitsuda composed the soundtrack for &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot;, again with Uematsu. According to Uematsu, Mitsuda again worked so much that he eventually defecated blood out of stress and physical problems. Mitsuda worked on three more titles for Square: &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; and &quot;Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki&quot; both in 1996, and &quot;Xenogears&quot; in 1998, which featured the first ballad in a Square game, the Celtic ending theme &quot;Small Two of Pieces&quot; sung by Joanne Hogg. Mitsuda also during this period produced albums of arranged music of his original scores, creating acid jazz remixes in &quot;Chrono Trigger Arranged Version: The Brink of Time&quot; and a Celtic arrangement album of Xenogears music, &quot;Creid&quot;. In July 1998, following up on what he had said in his original interview with the company, Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, the first of several of Square&#x27;s composers to do so.

Following his leaving, Mitsuda has only worked on one more original game with Square, composing for 1999&#x27;s &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. He has worked on over a dozen games since then, including the spiritual sequel to &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht&quot;, and major games such as &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot; and &quot;Luminous Arc&quot;. In addition to video games, Mitsuda has composed music for the anime &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; and for the independent album &quot;Kirite&quot;. On November 22, 2001, Mitsuda formed Procyon Studio as a company to produce his music, along with a record label, Sleigh Bells. The company consisted of only Mitsuda as composer along with a few sound producers for several years but has since expanded to include other composers. Mitsuda and Procyon Studio have also produced more arranged albums, such as &quot;Sailing to the World&quot; and 2009&#x27;s &quot;Colours of Light&quot;, a compilation album of vocal pieces Mitsuda had composed. The studio was also involved in co-designing the &quot;KORG DS-10&quot; synthesizer program for the Nintendo DS, and its successor for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;KORG M01D&quot;. 

By the late 2000s, Mitsuda began working as a producer for a team of artists. Scores in the 2010s include the &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; series, &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;Valkyria Revolution&quot;, with the latter marking his first fully solo game soundtrack in nearly a decade. Around the same time, Mitsuda also began to compose for non-video game media, including several NHK-produced television shows, as well as anime series such as &quot;Black Butler&quot; and adaptions of &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot;. In addition to serving as the lead composer for 2017&#x27;s &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, he also was in charge of the game&#x27;s audio budget, musician booking, schedule management, and music sheet proofreading, for which he claimed was the largest project he ever worked on. He also composed for its expansion pack, &quot;Torna – The Golden Country&quot;, and &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 3&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Mitsuda claims to compose by &quot;just fool[ing] around on my keyboard&quot; and letting the melodies come to him. He also sometimes comes up with songs while asleep, including the ending theme to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Bonds of Sea and Fire&quot; from &quot;Xenogears&quot;, though his main inspiration is visual items, &quot;paintings or other things&quot;. His music is frequently minimalistic, and he has cited Minimalism as an influence. His final battle themes for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Xenogears&quot; are based on only a few chords each, with the latter containing only two. Mitsuda has listened to a great number of musical genres throughout his life, which he learned from his father, and is especially inspired by jazz music. He grew up listening mainly to his father&#x27;s favourite jazz musician Art Blakey, in addition to the Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, before getting into classical music. He is also inspired by Celtic music, and has created two albums of music in that style. His soundtrack for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; also shows the influence of Asian music, including the sounds of Japanese shakuhachi flutes, Indian tabla drums and the sitar. He has cited Maurice Ravel, J.S. Bach, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Claude Debussy, Robert Schumann, Antonín Dvořák, and Gustav Holst as his favorite classical composers, claiming that his modern influences are too numerous to name as he listens to so much music.

Mitsuda names his favorite works as the soundtracks to the &quot;Chrono&quot; series, &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot;, and the original album &quot;Kirite&quot;, though he also says that all of his soundtracks are &quot;representational works&quot;, as they represent who he was as a composer when he made them. His favorite pieces overall are &quot;The Girl Who Closed Her Heart&quot; and &quot;Pain&quot; from &quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot; and pieces from &quot;Kirite&quot;. When he starts to compose a soundtrack, he first takes one month to gather information and artwork about the game world and scenario, so that his music will fit in with the game. He also finds it easier to be inspired if he has a visual representation. Mitsuda claims that he does not save his best work for more popular games, as he tries to compose each piece to correspond to how it is going to be used in a specific game. He also tries to compose good pieces even for games he feels do not live up to them, so that they will be a redeeming point about the game for the players. The majority of his video game soundtracks are for role-playing games, but he likes projects that are different from what he has done before and is interested in working in other genres.

==Legacy==

Mitsuda&#x27;s music from &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was first performed live by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra in 1996 at the Orchestral Game Concert in Tokyo, Japan, and released on an accompanying album. The first symphonic performance of his music outside Japan took place in 2005 at the Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany when music from &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; was presented. Mitsuda has arranged versions of music from &quot;Trigger&quot; and &quot;Cross&quot; for &quot;Play! A Video Game Symphony&quot; video game music concerts in 2006. Music from the two games has also been performed in other video game concert tours such as the Video Games Live concert series and in concerts by the Eminence Orchestra. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; music made up one fourth of the music of the &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; concerts in September 2009 at the Kölner Philharmonie which were produced by Thomas Böcker as a part of the &quot;Game Concerts&quot; series. &quot;Scars of Time&quot; from &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; was played at the &quot;Fantasy Comes Alive&quot; concert in Singapore on April 30, 2010.

Mitsuda&#x27;s music for &quot;Xenogears&quot; has also sparked fan-made albums; an officially licensed tribute album titled &quot;Xenogears Light: An Arranged Album&quot;, was published in limited quantities by the fan group OneUp Studios in 2005. The album features 20 tracks arranged from the &quot;Xenogears&quot; score and performed with acoustic instruments, such as piano, flute, guitar and violin. Another, unofficial album of remixes titled &quot;Humans + Gears&quot; was produced as a digital album by OverClocked Remix on October 19, 2009, consisting of 33 tracks. Selections of remixes of Mitsuda&#x27;s work also appear on Japanese remix albums, called Dōjin, and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked Remix. Music from the &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; soundtrack has been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music by DOREMI Music Publishing. Sheet music for &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; tracks arranged for both solo guitar and guitar duets has been released by Procyon Studio.

For the 20th anniversary of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; in 2015, Mitsuda, along with his performing group Millennial Fair, performed songs from the game at the Tokyo Globe in Tokyo, Japan on July 25 and 26. The event, titled &quot;The Brink of Time&quot;, included Mitsuda performing on the piano, guitar, and Irish bouzouki. During the event, Mitsuda also announced that the long requested &quot;Chrono&quot; series arrangement album, entitled &quot;To Far Away Times: Chrono Trigger &amp; Chrono Cross Arrangement Album&quot;, would be released by Square Enix Music on October 14, 2015.

<doc id="218684" wikidata="Q235509" url="?curid=218684" title="Elizabeth Arden">
<text>Elizabeth Arden (December 31, 1881 – October 18, 1966), also known as Elizabeth N. Graham, was a Canadian-American businesswoman who founded what is now Elizabeth Arden, Inc., and built a cosmetics empire in the United States. By 1929, she owned 150 salons in Europe and the United States. Her 1,000 products were being sold in 22 countries. She was the sole owner, and at the peak of her career, she was one of the wealthiest women in the world.

==Background==
She was born Florence Nightingale Graham on her family&#x27;s farm in Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada. She played with her birth date, but although her birth record seems to have disappeared, census records and a statutory declaration by her older brother, William Pearce Graham (1877–1959), both put the date at 1881. The property is currently home to the Vaughan Grove community. Her parents had immigrated to Canada from Cornwall, United Kingdom, in the 1870s. Her father, William Graham, was Scottish; her mother, Susan (née Tadd), was Cornish and had arranged for a wealthy aunt in Cornwall to pay for her children&#x27;s education.

After dropping out of nursing school in Toronto, she joined her elder brother in Manhattan, working briefly as a bookkeeper for the E. R. Squibb pharmaceutical company. While there, Arden spent hours in their lab, learning about skincare. She then worked for Eleanor Adair, an early beauty culturist, as a &quot;treatment girl&quot;.

Arden was allegedly a dedicated suffragette, and there is a story that she marched for women&#x27;s rights in 1912. It is a popular fiction that she supplied the marchers with red lipstick as a sign of solidarity, but there is little contemporary evidence supporting this. Women taking part in the 1912 march were advised to wear the same $7 straw hat, wear white, and to bring their children, to demonstrate their responsibility and simplicity. The use of cosmetics was never mentioned, which is hardly surprising: bold red lipstick still had tawdry associations with the theatre. Even as late as 1920 Arden herself was dismissive of &quot;powder and rouge ... so obvious in their artifice that their use was considered in questionable taste&quot;.

==Career==
In 1909, Arden formed a partnership with Elizabeth Hubbard, another culturist. The business relationship dissolved in 1910. Wanting to have a trade name, she used &quot;Elizabeth&quot; to save money on her salon signs. She chose the last name, &quot;Arden&quot;, from a nearby farm. Thus the trade name &quot;Elizabeth Arden&quot; was formed. From there, Arden founded the Red Door salon in New York in 1910, which has remained synonymous with her name ever since (see under Elizabeth Arden, Inc.).

In 1912, Arden traveled to France to learn beauty and facial massage techniques used in the Parisian beauty salons. She returned with a collection of rouges and tinted powders that she had created. She began expanding her international operations in 1915 and started opening salons across the world. In 1934, she opened the Maine Chance residential spa in Rome, Maine, the first destination beauty spa in the United States. It operated until 1970.

Arden was largely responsible for establishing makeup as proper and appropriate, even necessary, for a ladylike image; previously makeup had often been associated with lower classes and prostitutes. She targeted middle-aged and plain women for whom beauty products promised a youthful, beautiful image. In her salons and through her marketing campaigns, she stressed teaching women how to apply makeup and pioneered such concepts as scientific formulation of cosmetics, beauty makeovers, and coordinating colors of eye, lip and facial makeup.

In 1962, the French government awarded Arden the Légion d&#x27;Honneur, in recognition of her contribution to the cosmetics industry.

==Horse racing==
Arden was involved in the sport of Thoroughbred racing for many years. Her stable, Maine Chance Farm (named for her spa), owned – among other stakes winners – the 1947 Kentucky Derby winner Jet Pilot.

==Personal life and death==
Arden was married to Thomas Jenkins Lewis and to Prince Michael Evlanov. Both times, she divorced them.

Arden died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on October 18, 1966. She was interred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York, under the name Elizabeth N. Graham.

==In popular culture==
The musical &quot;War Paint&quot; dramatizes her rivalry with competitor Helena Rubinstein. After a successful tryout at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theater, the show opened on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre on April 6, 2017, earning four Tony Award nominations, including Best Actress in a Leading Role for Christine Ebersole&#x27;s portrayal of Arden, as well as for Patti Lupone for her role as Rubinstein. and closed on November 5, 2017.

The comedy &quot;Lip Service&quot; by the Australian dramatist John Misto chronicles the life and career of Helena Rubinstein and her rivalry with Elizabeth Arden and Revlon. &quot;Lip Service&quot; premiered April 26, 2017, at the Park Theatre in London, under the title &quot;Madame Rubinstein&quot;, before opening at Sydney&#x27;s Ensemble Theatre in August of the same year.

Elizabeth Arden, as student nurse Florence Nightingale Graham, appeared in an episode of the CBC period drama &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; (October 1, 2018), portrayed by Kathryn Alexandre.

A contract dispute that Arden faced with a former employee led the 1953 court case &quot;Crabtree v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp&quot;, which is now considered a seminal case on the application of the statute of frauds. Most law schools include this case in their required contract law course. (It is curious that &quot;Graham&#x27;s&quot; love interest in the &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; was named &quot;Crabtree&quot;.)

<text>Edward Moxon (12 December 1801 – 3 June 1858) was a British poet and publisher, significant in Victorian literature.

==Biography==
Moxon was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire, where his father Michael worked in the wool trade. In 1817 he left for London, joining Longman in 1821. In 1826, encouraged by his friend Charles Lamb, he published a volume of verse, entitled &quot;The Prospect, and other Poems&quot;, which was received favourably.

In 1830 Moxon started his own publishing firm in New Bond Street, aided by a £500 loan from Samuel Rogers. The first volume he produced was Charles Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Album Verses&quot;. Moxon also published an illustrated edition of Rogers&#x27;s &quot;Italy&quot; in 1830, £10,000 being spent upon the illustrations. Moving to 44 Dover Street, Piccadilly in 1833, Moxon married Emma Isola, the orphan adopted by Charles and Mary Lamb, in the same year. William Wordsworth entrusted him with the publication of his works from 1835 onwards, and in 1839 he issued the first complete edition of Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s poems, edited by Mary Shelley.

Atheistic passages in Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mab&quot; and unusual circumstances resulted in the Chartist Henry Hetherington prosecuting Moxon for blasphemous libel as a test of the law. The case was tried before Lord Denman, and Moxon was defended by his friend Serjeant Talfourd. The jury returned a guilty verdict, but the prosecution declined to seek any punishment.

Moxon continued to publish: in 1840 he published Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Sordello&quot; and James Stanislaus Bell&#x27;s &quot;Journal of a Residence in Circassia&quot;, and in succeeding years works by Richard Monckton Milnes, Tom Hood, Barry Cornwall, Lord Lytton, Browning, John Keats and Alfred Tennyson appeared. Both Tennyson and Wordsworth were to become personal friends of Moxon.
On Moxon&#x27;s death, his business was continued by the printer Frederick Evans and later James Bertrand Payne, with input from Moxon&#x27;s widow Emma and his son Arthur. In 1865 the firm published Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Atalanta in Calydon&quot;; in 1871 it was taken over by Ward, Lock &amp; Tyler.

<doc id="218690" wikidata="Q264737" url="?curid=218690" title="Battle of Tolbiac">
<text>The Battle of Tolbiac was fought between the Franks, who were fighting under Clovis I, and the Alamanni, whose leader is not known. The date of the battle has traditionally been given as 496, though other accounts suggest it may either have been fought earlier, in the 480s or early 490s, or later, in 506. The site of &quot;Tolbiac&quot;, or &quot;Tolbiacum&quot;, is usually given as Zülpich, North Rhine-Westphalia, about 60 km east of what is now the German-Belgian frontier. The Franks were successful at Tolbiac and established their dominance over the Alamanni.

==Background==
The Franks were two neighboring peoples, and allies: the Salian Franks, whose king was Clovis, and the Ripuarian Franks, whose capital was Cologne and whose king was Sigebert the Lame. Bordering on Sigebert&#x27;s kingdom were the Alemanni, a confederation of Germanic tribes. Border incidents, looting, and punitive raids multiplied between the Alemanni and Ripuarian Franks, but in 496 Sigebert suffered a real invasion and called on Clovis for help. Clovis responded favorably to his ally and raised an army. It is generally accepted that in defending Tolbiac, Sigebert and his army suffered heavy losses. There may have been two battles of Tolbiac.

==Battle==
Little is known about the battle, except that the Ripuarian Franks were probably of no help after the first battle. Clovis saw his warriors being killed and felt the battle was getting out of hand. Moved to tears, he called upon the God of his wife Clotilde, the God that she had preached to him since their marriage in 493, asking for his help.

Gregory of Tours records Clovis&#x27;s prayer in chapter II of the &quot;History of the Franks&quot;: &quot;O Jesus Christ, you who as Clotilde tells me are the son of the Living God, you who give succor to those who are in danger, and victory to those accorded who hope in Thee, I seek the glory of devotion with your assistance: If you give me victory over these enemies, and if I experience the miracles that the people committed to your name say they have had, I believe in you, and I will be baptized in your name. Indeed, I invoked my gods, and, as I am experiencing, they failed to help me, which makes me believe that they are endowed with no powers, that they do not come to the aid of those who serve. It&#x27;s to you I cry now, I want to believe in you if only I may be saved from my opponents.&quot; At these words, the Alemanni began to flee, as their leader had been killed with an axe. The Franks subdued or killed the remaining Alemanni.

==Account by Gregory of Tours==
Gregory of Tours was the first to have mentioned the element that has shaped subsequent interpretations of Tolbiac as climactic in European history: Clovis is said to have attributed his success to a vow that he had made: if he won, he would convert to the religion of the Christian God who had aided him. He became a Christian in a ceremony at Reims on Christmas 496. The traditional date of the battle of Tolbiac has been established to accord with this firmly attested baptismal date, by accepting Gregory&#x27;s account. A surviving letter from Avitus of Vienne, congratulating Clovis on his baptism, makes no mention of the supposed recent battlefield conversion.

&quot;Historia Francorum&quot; ii.30-31 directly affirms a parallel Gregory establishes with the conversion of Constantine the Great before the Battle of Milvian Bridge:

==Consequences==
The Alemanni abandoned the Lower Rhine and left the Ripuarian Franks alone. Clovis, who profited only a little, allowed his ally to retain the territory. Clovis later relied on Sigebert&#x27;s assistance during the conquest of the northern part of the Visigothic kingdom.

Another consequence was the conversion of Clovis to Catholicism as he was baptized by Bishop Remigius of Rheins, who wrote him a letter regarding his conversion. This brought him the support of neighbouring Christians, along with that of the influential clergy. In addition, it allowed Clovis to undertake conquests and crusades to Christianise his new territories or expunge Arianism, considered heretics by the clergy.

==Date==
The traditional date of the battle in 496 was challenged by Augustine Van de Vyver, whose revised chronology placed the battle in 506. This was extensively debated and is followed in some modern accounts. The date of 506 also follows Gregory&#x27;s chronology, which places the death of Clovis&#x27; father, Childeric I, around the same time as that of St. Perpetuus, who died in 491. Hence 15 years from 491 would be 506. Childeric&#x27;s grave contained coins of Emperor Zeno, who died in 491, but none after.

==Battle of Strasbourg (506)==

The Battle of Strasbourg in 506 CE is a battle that several researchers have postulated was the third battle presumed to have taken place between the Alamanni and the Franks and which resulted in the defeat and incorporation of the northern Alamanni into the Frankish Empire, whilst the southern Alamanni placed themselves under the protection of the Ostrogothic king, Theodoric the Great.

=== Historical sources ===
The historical sources only make indirect references to a possible third battle between the Alamanni and the Franks. A letter by Theodoric the Great dating to 506/7 to the Merovingian king, Clovis I, speaks of battles in which Clovis had engaged the Alamanni. In this letter, Theodoric calls upon his brother-in-law to moderate his anger against the Alamanni, to punish only those who were disloyal and to cease from fighting the rest of the Alamanni. Theodoric placed the latter under his personal protection. A panegyric by Ennodius about Theodoric the Great speaks exaggeratedly of a victory by Theodoric over the Alamanni.

=== Historical background ===
At the Battle of Tolbiac in 496 CE the Alamanni suffered a severe defeat at the hands of Clovis. As a consequence, some of the Alamanni appear to have come under the protection of the Merovingians. From Theodoric&#x27;s letter it may be assumed that these Alamanni subsequently broke their treaty with Clovis and for that reason they were persecuted and there were further battles between Clovis and the Alamanni. Several researchers believe that in 506 CE a third battle took place between the Alamanni and the Franks. What is certain is that between 496 and 506 there were further clashes. The location of the battle is not mentioned anywhere; that it was explicitly near Strasbourg, remains a theory held by a number of scholars. As a result of Clovis&#x27; victory, the northern half of the Alammanian lands went to the Franks while the southern half sought protection under Theoderic.

=== Outcome ===
==== Loss of territory ====
A consequence of losing the conflict between 496 and 506 against the Franks was that the territory that had been settled by the northern Alamanni, probably up to the present dialect boundary between the Alemannic and South Franconian dialects, finally came under Frankish rule.

==== Escape to Theoderic ====
Some of the Alamanni apparently fled southwards to Rhaetia and placed themselves under the protection of the King of the Ostrogoths, Theoderic. He went to his brother-in-law, Clovis I and interceded for the Alamanni, but acknowledged the anger of Clovis as justified. He therefore asked for the leaders to be punished but recommended clemency in sentencing. Theoderic promised that he would see to it that the Alamanni, who were in Rhaetia, also remained peaceful. Between the lines, Theoderic made it clear that he would thereby lay claim to the disputed area of Rhaetia and would use the Alamanni as a means of exerting pressure against Clovis if he did not recognize his supremacy there.

<text>The Battle of Königgrätz (or Sadowa) was the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War in which the Kingdom of Prussia defeated the Austrian Empire. It took place on 3 July 1866, near the Bohemian city of Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) and village of Sadová, now in the Czech Republic. It was the single largest battle of the war, and the largest battle in the world since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813.

Prussian forces totaled around 285,000 troops. Superior training, tactical doctrine and the Dreyse needle gun were instrumental in the victory. Prussian artillery was ineffective and almost all of the fighting on the Prussian side was done by the First Army under Prince Friedrich Karl and one division from the Second Army. The Prussian 7th Infantry Division and 1st Guards Infantry Division attacked and destroyed 38 out of 49 infantry battalions of four Austrian corps at the Swiepwald and Chlum at the centre of the battlefield. The Austrian army was forced to retreat at 15:00, before any Prussian reinforcements could engage the Austrian flanks.

==Background==

At the outset of the war in June, the Prussian armies were gathered along the Prussian border: the Army of the Elbe under Karl Herwarth von Bittenfeld at Torgau, the First Army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia between Senftenberg and Görlitz, and the Second Army under Crown Prince Frederick William in Silesia west of Neiße (Nysa). The Austrian army under Ludwig von Benedek was concentrated at Olmütz (Olomouc). The campaign began with Herwarth von Bittenfeld&#x27;s advance to Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony, where he easily defeated the Saxon army of 23,000 and joined with the First Army.

The Austrian commander Benedek had only reluctantly moved his troops out of their staging point at Olmütz on 18 June, moving north in three parallel columns with the I Corps protecting the right flank. The Austrians took up positions at the fortress Josefstadt and the mountain passes from Saxony and Silesia.

On 22 June, Prussia&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff, Helmuth von Moltke, ordered both armies under his command to Jitschin (Jičín) near the Austrian positions, a daring maneuver undertaken to limit the war&#x27;s duration despite the risk of one army being overtaken en route.

However, Benedek was indecisive and failed to use his superior numbers to eliminate the Prussian armies individually. Initially, the Austrians were pressed back everywhere except at Trautenau (Trutnov), where they bested the Prussians despite great losses to their own forces. By 29 June, Prince Friedrich Karl had reached Jitschin and inflicted a severe defeat on the Austrian I Corps under General Clam-Gallas. The Crown Prince had reached Königinhof (Dvůr Králové) despite stiff resistance.

On 30 June, Friedrich Karl&#x27;s First Army advanced to within one day&#x27;s march of the Second Army. However, for the next two days the Prussian cavalry lost sight of the Austrians entirely, although Moltke&#x27;s guess as to their actions—a retreat to the Elbe River—proved correct.

==Prelude==
Dismayed by his losses, Benedek had ordered a withdrawal and urgently requested that Emperor Franz Josef make peace as the only way to save the army from a &quot;catastrophe&quot;. When this was refused, and an ambiguous last sentence of the imperial telegram was interpreted as ordering a final stand, Benedek drew his Austrians up against the Elbe between Sadowa and Königgrätz.

The Prussians finally sighted the Austrians on the eve of 2 July near Sadowa, and Friedrich Karl planned to attack the next morning. Moltke ordered the Crown Prince Frederick William to join forces with the other two armies at the point where the Austrians were assembled, but the telegraph lines to the Second Army&#x27;s positions were out, necessitating the dispatch of two mounted officers at midnight to ride the twenty miles&#x27; distance in time. They arrived at 4 a.m. The Crown Prince&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Leonhard von Blumenthal, an able logistician, immediately reorganised Second Army&#x27;s route plan.

==Battle==

The Austrian army of 215,000 faced the Prussian Army of the Elbe (39,000) and First Army (85,000) on 3 July. The Austrian infantry was partially fortified and supported by cavalry in the rear and artillery units with firing range across hilly, wooded terrain. The battle began at dawn in subsiding rain and mist as Prussia took its position west of the Bystřice River. Shortly before 8 a.m., the Austrian artillery opened fire, pinning down the Prussian right flank under Herwarth von Bittenfeld. The Saxons on the Austrian left fell back in good order, and proceeded to rain down fire on the advancing Prussian right from higher ground. Herwarth von Bittenfeld ordered the advance guard of seven battalions, under Brig. General von Schöler pulled back to the river around 10:00 and take a defensive stance.
===Prussian advance into the Swiepwald===
The Prussian center, with the Prussian 7th Division under General Edward Frederick Charles von Fransecky, having secured the Prussian rear earlier, led the advance into the Swiepwald (Swiep Forest), where it was met by two Austrian corps. The 7th Division had to both clear out the forest, and cover the Prussian left until the Second Army, under the crown prince, arrived. The Prussians methodically cleared the villages of Austrian defenders. King Wilhelm I of Prussia ordered the First Army across the river to support Fransecky. Sadowa was captured, but a fierce battle ensued in a nearby forest. The Austrian artillery held off the Prussians by firing into the smoke of the Prussian advance. The Prussians were slowed, and although the river was easy to wade, transporting artillery across it was extremely difficult. The Prussian attack was halted as the advancing Prussian 8th and 4th Divisions were cut down by the Austrian artillery as soon as they emerged from the smoke. However, the Austrian leader, Benedek, refused to call for a cavalry charge which later commentators have argued might have won the battle. Reserve units were deployed at noon, but the outcome of the battle was still uncertain and Prussian commanders anxiously waited for the crown prince.

To this point, the Austrian superiority in numbers and position had held the day. Their weapons had longer range, which meant that the outnumbered Prussians could neither advance against the artillery barrage, nor effectively engage the Austrian infantry. The Prussians had attempted to bring three armies together for the battle, but problems with sending orders by telegraph and moving men by railroad had meant that only two of the three armies had arrived in time. The Prussian center, in the cover of the forest, was able to hold its position, and discourage a mounted charge by the Austrians, who were thought to have superior cavalry. However the close contact of the fight in the forest began to negate the Austrian advantages, the Austrians could not train their artillery on the close fighting, the damp weather made a cavalry charge risky, and the Austrian IV Corps was committed piecemeal to the fighting. At this point the relative strengths of the two armies were beginning to reverse. The shorter range of the Prussian artillery as compared to the Austrian was moot, while the vastly higher rate of fire from the Prussian breechloading needle gun, compared to the Austrian muzzleloading small arms and cannon, was paramount. In addition the needle gun could be operated while prone in defense, and while moving quickly on the advance, while the Austrians had to stand up after each shot to reload their Lorenz rifles.

===Austrian counterattack===

At 11:00 came the deciding moment of the battle; the Austrian centre began a manoeuvre to flank the Prussian 7th Division, which had pushed back and held off nearly a quarter of the Austrian army. Colonel Carl von Pöckh was sent to drive the Prussians back, and with a fierce infantry charge managed to force the 7th Division back to the outskirts of the forest. Flanking fire raked Pöckh&#x27;s battalion, annihilating it as a fighting force and killing its commander. The fire came from the 8th Division which stiffened the Prussian center to hold off the Austrian thrusts.

While divisions from the Austrian II and IV Corps were committed to the fighting, there was no decisive infantry charge, nor did the Prussians present a flank that could be attacked with cavalry. The Austrians ultimately were caught having moved from their defensive position to attack, and their right flank was exposed to the arriving Prussian infantry.

However, neither cavalry nor artillery gave direct help to the Prussian Infantry. Around 12:30 two rifled batteries of 2nd Division arrived, and around 13:00, Oberst von Bülow, part of Army of the Elbe, brought the corps artillery, two regiments, to the battlefield. After 1 o&#x27;clock, Oberst von Rozynski commanded 66 guns in this area. However they were too far to the rear to be used effectively. This kept Karl Eberhard Herwarth von Bittenfeld from ordering a major attack against the Austrian left.

===Arrival of the Prussian Second Army===

At 14:30 Crown Prince Frederick William finally arrived with the main bulk of his almost 100,000 men, having marched with all possible haste all morning, and hit the Austrian right flank retiring from the Swiepwald while the Prussian artillery pounded the Austrian center. By 16:00 the last individual counter-attacks by the Austrian I and VI Corps were broken, even as Benedek ordered a withdrawal. Lt. General 1st Prussian Guard reached the Austrian artillery, forcing them to stop reforming an artillery line and pull back. He had attacked because he saw the artillery as holding together the Austrian position, and his attack destroyed the lone cavalry battery that stayed to fight, and forced the others to flee, along with their reserves.

At this point, having taken severe casualties, lacking artillery and cavalry cover, the high ground in enemy hands and the center being rolled up, the position for the Austrians deteriorated rapidly. The Second Prussian Army completely broke through the Austrian lines and took behind the center. The Army of the Elbe, which had merely held position after the early morning bloodying by the Austrian artillery and the Saxon infantry, attacked and broke through the Austrian left flank. It seized , and proceeded to destroy the Austrian flank. The Prussian king ordered all remaining forces into the attack all along the line, which had been slowed by the final counter-attack from the battalions of Brigadier General Ferdinand Rosenzweig von Dreuwehr&#x27;s Austrian brigade. The arriving reinforcements joined the fight just as the Austrians had forced the 1st Prussian Guard back to Chlum. The result was a decisive shock of firepower which collapsed the Austrian line. The Prussian advance was so rapid that Benedek ordered a series of cavalry countercharges to back up his artillery and cover the general retreat he ordered at 15:00. These were successful at covering the Austrian rear, keeping the bridges over the Elbe open for retreating Austrian soldiers, and preventing pursuit by the Prussians, but at a terrible cost: 2,000 men and almost as many horses were killed, wounded or captured in the action. Benedek himself crossed the Elbe near 18:00 and several hours later informed the emperor that the catastrophe of which he had warned had indeed occurred.

The battle ended with heavy casualties for both sides. The Prussians had nearly 9,000 men killed, wounded or missing. The Austrians and allies had roughly 31,000 men killed, wounded or missing, with 9,291 of these being prisoners. Compounding the Austrians&#x27; losses was Austria&#x27;s earlier refusal to sign the First Geneva Convention. As a result, Austrian medical personnel were regarded as combatants, and withdrew from the field with the main bulk of the forces, leaving the wounded to die on the field.

==Aftermath==
Königgrätz was the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War. The Prussians then continued to pursue the defeated Austrian Nord-Armee and fought a series of minor clashes, with the last skirmish being fought at distant Blumenau (today&#x27;s Lamač, district of Bratislava, Slovakia) on 22 July, just as the Peace of Prague to put a halt to the fighting was being signed. It provided a great opportunity for Prussian statesmen, by clearing a path toward German unification, in particular with the Little Germany (Germany without Austria) solution, with the subsequent foundation of the North German Confederation. The outcome also ensured that Prussia would have a free hand when a war with France came to pass in 1870.

After this Prussian victory, France attempted to extract territorial concessions in the Palatinate and Luxembourg. In his speech to the Reichstag on 2 May 1871, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck stated:

The Königgrätzer Marsch was written to commemorate the battle.

The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded &quot;Revanche pour Sadova&quot; or &quot;Revenge for Sadowa&quot;, which formed part of the background to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.

After the battle, over 900 soldiers were left wounded on the field without medical care. Arriving several days later with a large stock of supplies, Saxon nurse Marie Simon tended to the wounded for 17 weeks. This experience led her and Carola of Vasa to establish the , a precursor to the German Red Cross.

There are 475 different memorials scattered on the battlefield and in its surroundings. Some of them are located on the sites where individuals, mostly officers, were killed. Other memorials are located on the sites of graves of Austrian, Prussian or Saxon soldiers, who often rest together in mass ones. The memorials were erected with funds from the families of the fallen, regiments, officers, the Order of St. John, and especially the Central Committee for the Preservation of Monuments from the War of 1866.

<text>Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (Spanish: &quot;Aeropuerto Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci&quot;) , commonly known as the Isla Grande Airport (Spanish: &quot;Aeropuerto de Isla&quot; &quot;Grande&quot;) is a small airport in Puerto Rico serving the capital municipality of San Juan and its metropolitan area since 1929. Named after U.S. Air Force Major Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci, the airport is located on San Juan Bay in the Isla Grande district of barrio Santurce in San Juan, about from the Old San Juan historic quarter, Condado and Isla Verde resort areas, Hato Rey business center, and SJU main airport. While its primary activity is general aviation, SIG also handles commercial international and domestic flights, particularly between the main island and the Spanish Virgin Islands of Vieques and Culebra. It processed 37,084 total passengers in 2023.
==History==
Originally constructed by the U.S. Navy as Naval Air Station Isla Grande prior to World War II in 1929, the facility also served as Puerto Rico&#x27;s main international airport until 1954, when Isla Verde International Airport (subsequently renamed Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in 1985) was built. Until that year, all international airlines, such as Deutsche Luft Hansa, Iberia Airlines, Delta and Pan Am, flew to Isla Grande.

Until 1971, the airport also hosted Coast Guard Air Station San Juan. That year, the Coast Guard relocated its air station to Ramey Air Force Base on Puerto Rico&#x27;s northwest coast.

Isla Grande was renamed in honor of United States Air Force Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci, an F-111 pilot who was killed in action during Operation El Dorado Canyon (the 1986 airstrike of Libya).

A controversy regarding Isla Grande and Dorado Airport surfaced in 2003. Dorado Airport wanted to expand and attract the private aviation sector that has been Isla Grande&#x27;s main business for so long. Dorado airport eventually became a victim of urban development in Dorado and no longer exists.

In early 2003, it was announced that the Puerto Rico Grand Prix would be held on a 1.6 mile, 10-turn, temporary circuit on the airport&#x27;s runway and taxiways as the season final of the 2003 SCCA Trans Am Series. The race, held on October 26, 2003, was won by Puerto Rican native Wally Castro. The event was initially on the 2004 Trans-Am Series schedule, but was cancelled a month before its running.

In 2006, after a detailed impact study and many rumors about the future of the airport, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority announced that Isla Grande airport would remain open for the foreseeable future, mostly because of its key function as the primary reliever for the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport.

On August 4, 2011, the FAA announced that they were planning to close the airport&#x27;s control tower due to budget cuts, since they operate it instead of the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.

On July 8, 2012, airport officials denied via written communication to a local newspaper of &quot;any plans to eliminate or privatize the airport, since the airport is one of the most important airports for general aviation on Puerto Rico, taking into account that its operation approximates around 300 daily operations.&quot; On that same newspaper it was published that Seaborne Airlines, a regional air carrier, would transition its scheduled passenger operations to the neighboring San Juan Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport (SJU) with complete pullout on January 16, 2013.

For a short period of time between 2007 and 2009, the airport became the flight hub of Puerto Rico&#x27;s unofficial flag carrier, Prinair, when that airline briefly returned to operating.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 9/27 with an asphalt surface measuring .

For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2013, the airport had 116,447 aircraft operations, an average of 319 per day: 92% general aviation, 6% air taxi, and 2% military. At that time there were 232 aircraft based at this airport: 33% single-engine, 37% multi-engine, 1% jet, 24% helicopter, and 6% military.

==San Juan Army Aviation Support Facility==
The San Juan Army Aviation Support Facility operated by Puerto Rico Army National Guard (PRARNG) is the only military site on Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport. Its mission is to provide aviation maintenance support, and repair to the Puerto Rico Army National Guard and the following units:

* Company A, 1st Battalion, 111th Aviation Regiment
* Company D, 1st Battalion, 114th Aviation Regiment
* Detachment 1, Company B, 1st Battalion, 114th Aviation Regiment

The military aircraft at this facility are UH-72 Lakota and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and the Beechcraft C-12 Huron.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On October 1, 1942, a Douglas C-39 (DC-2) of the U.S. Army Air Forces flying from Losey Field in southern Puerto Rico to Isla Grande crashed into a hill in Coamo instead, killing all 22 people on board.
* On April 11, 1952, Pan Am Flight 526A crashed into the sea just after takeoff due to engine failure, killing 52 out of 69 passengers and crew.
* On December 21, 1991, a United Airlines Boeing 757 flight en route to San Juan&#x27;s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport mistakenly landed at Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport. The aircraft, which was on a chartered flight as United Airlines Flight 5850, was later flown, without any passengers onboard (as the passengers departed from Isla Grande to their hotels by bus), to Luis Munoz Marin Airport. 
* June 7, 1992: An Executive Air (for American Eagle) CASA 212 flying from Dominicci Airport crashed short of the runway in Mayagüez, killing both crew members and all three passengers.
* In December 2002, a helicopter that had been rented from a company that operates out of this airport was hijacked and taken to a jail in Ponce, where six inmates boarded the helicopter, forcing the pilot to drop them off at a farm. The pilot was able to fly back after he lied to the prisoners about their whereabouts, making them jump off the helicopter and zig-zagging the helicopter to prevent them from shooting at him. Soon after, all escapees were found by the police.
* On January 10, 2015, a Robinson R22 collided with the ocean (near Cataño Ferry terminal, San Juan bay) shortly after takeoff due to disorientation and failure to maintain rotor rpm, killing 1 (student performing a solo flight) and leaving the helicopter damaged beyond repair.
*On July 4, 2017, an aircraft that had taken off Ribas Dominicci Airport crashed nearby at a bay. The crash resulted in four injuries.

<doc id="218701" wikidata="Q3471218" url="?curid=218701" title="Samuel Rogers">
<text>Samuel Rogers (30 July 1763 – 18 December 1855) was an English poet, during his lifetime one of the most celebrated, although his fame has long since been eclipsed by his Romantic colleagues and friends Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron. His recollections of these and other friends such as Charles James Fox are key sources for information about London artistic and literary life, with which he was intimate, and which he used his wealth to support. He made his money as a banker and was also a discriminating art collector.

==Early life and family==
Rogers was born at Newington Green, then a village north of Islington, and now in Inner London. His father, Thomas Rogers, a banker and briefly MP for Coventry, was the son of a Stourbridge glass manufacturer, who was also a merchant in Cheapside. Thomas married Mary, the only daughter of his father&#x27;s partner, Daniel Radford, becoming himself a partner shortly afterwards. On his mother&#x27;s side Samuel Rogers was connected with the well-known Welsh Dissenting clergymen Philip Henry and his son Matthew, was brought up in Nonconformist circles, and became a long-standing member of the Unitarian congregation at Newington Green, then led by the remarkable Dr Richard Price. He was educated in Hackney and Stoke Newington.

Two nephews, orphaned young and for whom he assumed responsibility, were Samuel Sharpe, the Egyptologist and translator of the Bible, and his younger brother Daniel, the early geologist.

==The young man==
Samuel Rogers wished to enter the Presbyterian ministry, but his father persuaded him to join the banking business in Cornhill. In long holidays, necessitated by delicate health, Rogers became interested in English literature, particularly the work of Samuel Johnson, Thomas Gray and Oliver Goldsmith. He learned Gray&#x27;s poems by heart, and his family wealth allowed him the leisure to try writing poetry himself. He began with contributions to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and in 1786 he published a volume containing some imitations of Goldsmith and an &quot;Ode to Superstition&quot; in the style of Gray.

In 1788 his elder brother Thomas died, and Samuel&#x27;s business responsibilities were increased. In the next year he paid a visit to Scotland, where he met Adam Smith, Henry Mackenzie, Hester Thrale and others. In 1791 he was in Paris, and enjoyed the Orleans Collection of art at the Palais Royal, many of the treasures of which were later to pass into his possession. With Gray as his model, Rogers took great pains in polishing his verses, and six years elapsed after the publication of his first volume before he printed his elaborate poem on &quot;The Pleasures of Memory&quot; (1792) – regarded by some as the last embodiment of the poetic diction of the 18th century. The theory of elevating and refining familiar themes by abstract treatment and lofty imagery is taken to extremes. In this art of &quot;raising a subject&quot;, as the 18th century phrase was, the &quot;Pleasures of Memory&quot; is much more perfect than Thomas Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Pleasures of Hope&quot;, published a few years later in imitation. Byron said of it, &quot;There is not a vulgar line in the poem.&quot;

==Middle life and friendships==
In 1793 his father&#x27;s death gave Rogers the principal share in the banking house in Cornhill, and a considerable income. He left Newington Green and established himself in chambers in the Temple. Within his intimate circle at this time were his best friend, Richard Sharp (Conversation Sharp), and the artists John Flaxman, John Opie, Martin Shee and John Henry Fuseli. He also made the acquaintance of Charles James Fox, with whom he visited the galleries in Paris in 1802, and whose friendship introduced him to Holland House. In 1803 he moved to 22 St James&#x27;s Place, where for fifty years he entertained all the celebrities of London. Flaxman and Charles Alfred Stothard had a share in the decoration of the house, which Rogers virtually rebuilt, and proceeded to fill with works of art. His collections at his death realised £50,000.

In the mid-nineteenth century, social breakfasts were in vogue in London. Rogers hosted social breakfasts with guests such as Thomas Macaulay, Henry Hallam, Sydney Smith, George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, Nassau Senior, Charles Greville, Henry Hart Milman, Anthony Panizzi, George Cornewall Lewis, Sylvain Van de Weyer, Charles Babbage and Catharine Sedgwick An invitation to one of Rogers&#x27;s breakfasts was a formal entry into literary society, and his dinners were even more select. His social success was due less to his literary position than to his powers as a conversationalist, his educated taste in all matters of art, and no doubt to his sarcastic and bitter wit, for which he excused himself by saying that he had such a small voice that no one listened if he said pleasant things. &quot;He certainly had the kindest heart and unkindest tongue of any one I ever knew,&quot; said Fanny Kemble. He helped the poet Robert Bloomfield, he reconciled Thomas Moore with Francis Jeffrey and with Byron, and he relieved Sheridan&#x27;s difficulties in the last days of his life. Moore, who refused help from all his friends, and would only owe debts to his publishers, found it possible to accept help from Rogers. He procured a pension for HF Cary, the translator of Dante, and obtained Wordsworth his sinecure as distributor of stamps. John Mitford, while maintaining his country livings, rented permanent lodgings in Sloane Street, where he enjoyed &quot;the most perfect intimacy with Samuel Rogers for more than twenty years&quot;.

Rogers was in effect a literary dictator in England. He made his reputation by &quot;The Pleasures of Memory&quot; when William Cowper&#x27;s fame was still in the making. He became the friend of Wordsworth, Walter Scott and Byron, and lived long enough to give an opinion as to the fitness of Alfred Tennyson for the post of Poet Laureate. Alexander Dyce, from the time of his first introduction to Rogers, was in the habit of writing down the anecdotes with which his conversation abounded. In 1856 he arranged and published selections as &quot;Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers&quot;, to which is added &quot;Porsoniana&quot;. Rogers himself kept a notebook in which he entered impressions of the conversation of many of his distinguished friends—Fox, Edmund Burke, Henry Grattan, Richard Porson, John Horne Tooke, Talleyrand, Lord Erskine, Scott, Lord Grenville and the Duke of Wellington. They were published by his nephew William Sharpe in 1859 as &quot;Recollections by Samuel Rogers&quot;; &quot;Reminiscences and Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers, Banker, poet, and Patron of the Arts, 1763–1855&quot; (1903), by GH Powell, is an amalgamation of these two authorities.

Rogers held various honorary positions: he was one of the trustees of the National Gallery; and he served on a commission to inquire into the management of the British Museum, and on another for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1796.

==Later life==

His literary production remained slow. &quot;An Epistle to a Friend&quot; (the above-mentioned Conversation Sharp), published in 1798, describes Rogers&#x27;s ideal of a happy life. This was followed by &quot;The Voyage of Columbus&quot; (1810), and by &quot;Jacqueline&quot; (1814), a narrative poem, written in the iambic tetrameter of the newer writers, and published in the same volume with Byron&#x27;s &quot;Lara&quot;. His reflective poem on &quot;Human Life&quot; (1819), on which he had been engaged for twelve years, is written in his earlier manner.

In 1814 Rogers made a tour on the Continent with his sister Sarah. He travelled through Switzerland to Italy, keeping a full diary of events and impressions, and had made his way to Naples when the news of Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba obliged him to hurry home. Seven years later he returned to Italy, paying a visit to Byron and Shelley at Pisa. Out of the earlier of these tours arose his last and longest work, &quot;Italy&quot;. The first part was published anonymously in 1822; the second, with his name attached, in 1828. It was at first a failure, but Rogers was determined to make it a success. He enlarged and revised the poem, and commissioned illustrations from J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Stothard and Samuel Prout. These were engraved on steel in the sumptuous edition of 1830. The book then proved a great success, and Rogers followed it up with an equally sumptuous edition of his &quot;Poems&quot; (1834). In 1850, on Wordsworth&#x27;s death, Rogers was asked to succeed him as poet laureate, but declined the honour on account of his age. For the last five years of his life he was confined to his chair in consequence of a fall in the street. He died in London at 92, a remarkable age for the time, and is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hornsey High Street, Haringey.

==Notes==
==References==
A full account of Rogers is given in two works by P. W. Clayden, &quot;The Early Life of Samuel Rogers&quot; (1887) and &quot;Rogers and his Contemporaries&quot; (2 vols., 1889). One of the best accounts of Rogers, containing many examples of his caustic wit, is by Abraham Hayward in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; for July 1856.

<doc id="218705" wikidata="Q493697" url="?curid=218705" title="The String Cheese Incident">
<text>The String Cheese Incident (SCI) is an American jam band from Crested Butte and Telluride, Colorado, formed in 1993. The band is composed of Michael Kang (acoustic/electric mandolin, electric guitar, and violin), Michael Travis (drums and percussion), Bill Nershi (acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, and electric slide guitar), Kyle Hollingsworth (piano, organ, Rhodes, and accordion), and Keith Moseley (bass guitar), and, since 2004, Jason Hann (auxiliary percussion).

Their music has elements of bluegrass sounds, as well as rock, electronica, calypso, country, funk, jazz, Latin, progressive rock, reggae, and psychedelia. All members write original compositions and sing.

==History==
===1993–2001===
The original four members (Nershi, Kang, Travis and Moseley) first played together in Crested Butte, Colorado in 1993, calling themselves the Blue String Cheese Band, because they considered themselves a bluegrass band who also played &quot;cheesy covers&quot;. Soon after, they changed the name to the String Cheese Incident. In 1996 the members all quit their day jobs and moved to Boulder, Colorado, to focus on music. Around that time they decided that they wanted to add a keyboard player to the group, to expand their sound beyond string instruments, and invited Kyle Hollingsworth to join them.

After a few years of playing local ski resorts and private functions, the band formed the independent record label SCI Fidelity, on which they released their first album, &quot;Born on the Wrong Planet&quot;, an album split between originals and covers. The album featured melody-driven music with room for improvisation. Instrumentals and covers constituted half of the album. Many songs from the first album are still frequently played by the band, including &quot;Black Clouds&quot;, &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;, and &quot;Jellyfish.&quot;

Less than a year later, SCI released a compilation of ten songs, including &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot;, on their self-titled live album &quot;A String Cheese Incident&quot;, which chronicles a single concert from the Fox Theatre in Boulder, Colorado and adds pianist Hollingsworth to the ensemble (he was not in the band during the recording of &quot;Born on the Wrong Planet&quot;). Despite spanning only one disc and containing only ten tracks, the album clocks in at 72 minutes even (thus, with an average track length of 7:12, displaying their propensity for extended jams).

&quot;&#x27;Round the Wheel&quot;, released in 1998, refined the band&#x27;s sound and displayed a marked increase in both musical and lyrical maturity, and added Paul McCandless as a guest player on soprano and tenor saxophone and Tony Furtado on banjo, but did not earn them quite the level of fame that they would achieve in the next millennium. From 1998 through 2001 SCI toured the country extensively and steadily, playing over 500 &quot;Incidents&quot; in hundreds of cities, including an appearance at Woodstock &#x27;99.

In 2001, with the help of guest producer and Los Lobos member Steve Berlin, they released their third studio effort, &quot;Outside Inside&quot;. This album marked a shift from the band&#x27;s traditional bluegrass leanings to a more standard rock sound, thus making it the most accessible album to a mainstream audience to that point. The band did not completely abandon its bluegrass roots, however, sneaking in the short three-minute track &quot;Up the Canyon&quot; at the end of the disc, which has become one of many live favorites along with &quot;Rollover&quot;, &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, and others.

===2002–2004===
In August 2003, SCI&#x27;s in-house ticket selling service, SCI Ticketing (now Baseline Ticketing), sued Ticketmaster, which controlled nearly all of the larger venues the band was playing. SCI alleged that by restricting bands from selling directly to fans more than 8% of a venue&#x27;s tickets violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The suit followed an unsuccessful petitioning by SCI, R.E.M., Pearl Jam and other bands calling for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Ticketmaster&#x27;s high service fees and anti-competitive practices. The parties settled in 2008, and the band gained a larger allotment of tickets to sell and agreed to not publicize the settlement.

In October 2003, SCI released their fourth studio album, &quot;Untying the Not&quot;, produced by Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover, formerly of the band the Killing Joke. The release continued SCI&#x27;s use of electronic music and trance elements. Both Travis and Kang got into electronic music around the same time and started pushing the group in that direction.

In the summer of 2004, SCI booked to play the touring festival Lollapalooza; thereby becoming the caravan&#x27;s first jam band. But poor ticket sales led to the festival&#x27;s cancellation and the band re-routed its summer tour.

===2005–2006===
In June 2005, the band released their fifth studio album, titled &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, containing thirteen original tracks with guest songwriting collaborations, including Jim Lauderdale. In 2005, the band also welcomed percussionist Jason Hann. The album was produced by Malcolm Burn at a studio in Boulder, Colorado, where the band is based. &quot;One Step Closer&quot; was a return to the more roots-based music of earlier String Cheese Incident fare, while still retaining some of the pop sensibility of previous studio albums.

Through Madison House Inc., the company that manages and books SCI, the band organized &#x27;Big Summer Classic&#x27;, a 2005 traveling festival tour across the United States. Seven-person ensemble New Monsoon opened the festival&#x27;s shows, which included acts such as Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, Yonder Mountain String Band, Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead, and Keller Williams. The band played in medium-size outdoor venues, such as minor-league baseball parks.

In 2005, the band returned to their roots: playing shows at the base of ski resorts, summer festivals, smaller venues, and touring throughout the U.S. Band members announced to their fans that the band would take a break from touring in early 2006. They recommenced in the summer of the same year to play several co-headlining shows with Bob Weir&#x27;s RatDog including a sold-out two-night run at Red Rocks in Morrison, Colorado and a set at the 10,000 Lakes Music Festival in Minnesota with well-known acoustic artist Keller Williams.

===2007===
The band announced a few shows for 2007, including their annual Winter Carnival (sans 2006), which stopped in Denver and Vail, Colorado, and an appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival as well as the 10,000 Lakes Festival. The band concluded their reign among the jamband leadership circuit and rode out into the sunset with a series of shows at their favorite places (New York, San Francisco, Oregon), as well as a revival of the Big Summer Classic festival at Camp Zoe, culminating with a last blowout at Red Rocks Amphitheatre during August 9–12.

The band had re-recorded their song &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; in Simlish, the native language of The Sims, that was included in the 5th Expansion Pack – Seasons.

===2008===
All members were present at the Rothbury Music Festival in Rothbury, Michigan, performing with their respective solo projects. The Kyle Hollingsworth Band and EOTO performed on Thursday, Panjea with Michael Kang and Keller Williams featuring Keith Moseley performed on Friday, and the Emmitt-Nershi Band performed on Saturday. Also, at Yarmony Grass Music Festival all members except for Keith got together and played Will it Go &#x27;Round in Circles together, as well as Pretty Polly.

===2009===
On March 16, 2009, it was announced that the String Cheese Incident would reunite for the second annual Rothbury Festival. The band played an unannounced, invitation-only, &quot;soundcheck&quot; show at the Ogden Theatre in Denver on June 24.

In October 2009, Michael Travis told the Colorado Daily newspaper in Boulder: &quot;We are going to be playing some shows next summer and fall. We&#x27;re not sure about the dates, but we&#x27;re definitely going to be playing. We&#x27;re excited to put all we can into this incredible meeting of music, hearts and minds. It&#x27;s going to be exciting to reunite for those shows.&quot;

===2010===
On February 2, 2010, it was announced that String Cheese Incident would reunite for seven shows in the summer — the first three being a weekend concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, then a four-night &quot;Incident&quot; at Horning&#x27;s Hideout. The final stop on their 2010 calendar: a &quot;Hulaween&quot; weekend of Incidents on Friday, October 29, with The Disco Biscuits, and a three set night on October 30 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia.

On October 20, 2010, Billy Nershi announced that, &quot;[They&#x27;re] also planning on doing something next summer at the Rothbury site. That will be a weekend festival with a lot of String Cheese sets. It&#x27;ll be different from Rothbury in that it will be more like our thing at Horning&#x27;s, where String Cheese plays every night, and it will include bands in [The] String Cheese family with art installations and that kind of thing&quot;

===2011===
In Spring 2011, String Cheese Incident played a three-night run March 10–12 at the 1st Bank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, which they called the &quot;Winter Carnival 2011.&quot; The show featured live acrobatics and a costume contest for the attendees, as well as a Conscious Alliance food drive which offered a special edition 3-panel poster to anyone who donated 25 cans of food.

In Summer 2011, String Cheese played the Which Stage at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee on June 11. 
Later that summer, String Cheese was featured as a headliner for three out of four nights (July 1–3) of the opening year for the Electric Forest Festival, an event which the band hosted in Rothbury, Michigan.

On September 19, 2011, the band announced that they would be making a tour along America&#x27;s East Coast (as well as two cities in the Midwest) entitled the Roots Run Deep 2011 Tour.

===2014===
In 2014 the String Cheese Incident released &quot;A Song In My Head&quot;, their first studio album since 2005. The album was produced by Talking Heads keyboard player Jerry Harrison.

The band toured briefly in support of its album, including a free concert in Boulder and an appearance at Delfest in Cumberland, Maryland.

===2015===
In June 2015, the String Cheese Incident invited Skrillex, a well-known American electronic music artist, to jam with them at the Electric Forest festival.

===2016–2017===
The String Cheese Incident continued to tour, and released the &quot;Believe&quot; recording in 2017.

==Stage productions and effects==
As the band&#x27;s popularity grew, so did the stage show and spectacle elements of many of their live shows. An organization called Peak Experience Productions was hired to add various eye psychedelia, and audience participatory activities, to larger &quot;Incidents&quot; such as New Year&#x27;s Eve and Halloween (dubbed &quot;Hulaween&quot; due to the band&#x27;s early connection to the modern hooping movement). Themed events such as &quot;Full Moon Dream Dance, Evolution&quot;, &quot;Dancing Around the Wheel of Time&quot;, a &quot;Subway Ride Through New York City&quot;, and a &quot;Time Traveler&#x27;s Ball&quot; are some examples.

During the 2000s, the band also established an annual summer event at Horning&#x27;s Hideout in Oregon, bringing Peak Experience out into the woods to add to the circular energy and rapport between the band and its audience. At the same time, as the band&#x27;s popularity grew, so did the sizes of the crowds coming to see them; SCI headlined festivals such as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits and the Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival, and began playing in some larger venues to accommodate their growing fanbase.

SCI released live three-CD sets of all 19 shows that they played in April 2002 on their spring tour. In this regard, they are believed to have taken a cue from Phish&#x27;s &quot;Live Phish&quot; series and stepped up the formula a notch by releasing every show instead of just select concerts. Not stopping with the spring tour, SCI has released nearly every song from every concert from every tour through the present, barring those where technical difficulties or contractual guest artist complications are involved. Christening the series &quot;On the Road&quot;, the shows are released on the SCI Fidelity label for fans who do not have the time or means to engage in active tape trading.

==Side projects==
Michael Travis founded the acoustic trio, Zuvuya, with Jamie Janover and Xander Greene in 2001 and started the trance music band Zilla during 2003.

Bill Nershi and his wife Jillian started a bluegrass/acoustic band called Honkytonk Homeslice, which has toured across the US, especially in the West, and is scheduled to tour with Drew Emmitt of Leftover Salmon, Billed as The Emmitt-Nershi Band. Bill Nershi also fronts a side project called Billy Nershi&#x27;s Blue Planet.

Kyle Hollingsworth plays with various side projects around Colorado including his own band, Kyle Hollingsworth, that plays SCI songs Kyle has written over the years as well as some of his other original pieces. His band features members of the Boulder-based group, The Motet.

Michael Kang plays occasionally with Pangaea (African rooted band), and spends much of his off time travelling the world.

In 2006, Jason Hann and Michael Travis started a live looping project called EOTO. One time throughout their 2008 tour they were joined by Kyle Hollingsworth and Michael Kang making it everyone from SCI except Bill Nershi and Keith Moseley. These four played together on August 6, 2011 at Yarmony Grass Music Festival 2011 in Rancho del Rio, Colorado under the moniker &quot;The Trancident.&quot; The group went on tour in 2012 with a psychedelic &quot;Lotus Flower&quot; stage designed by Zebbler. EOTO disbanded in 2021.

In 2007, Keith Moseley toured with Keller Williams in Keller&#x27;s newly formed band: Keller Williams with Moseley, Droll and Sipe &quot;(formerly the WMDs)&quot;. He also performed with Keller as part of Grateful Grass, a project performing bluegrass covers of songs by The Grateful Dead and releasing a live album in support of the Rex Foundation.

In 2022, Michael Travis and Aaron Johnston (Brazilian Girls, David Byrne&#x27;s American Utopia) founded the improvisational duo Snakes &amp; Stars.

<doc id="218706" wikidata="Q2564041" url="?curid=218706" title="Basic block">
<text>In compiler construction, a basic block is a straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit. This restricted form makes a basic block highly amenable to analysis. Compilers usually decompose programs into their basic blocks as a first step in the analysis process. Basic blocks form the vertices or nodes in a control-flow graph.

==Definition==
The code in a basic block has:
* One entry point, meaning that no code within it is the destination of a jump instruction anywhere in the program.
* One exit point, meaning that only the last instruction can cause the program to begin executing code in a different basic block.
Under these circumstances, whenever the first instruction in a basic block is executed, the rest of the instructions are necessarily executed exactly once and in order.

The code may be source code, assembly code, or some other sequence of instructions.

More formally, a sequence of instructions forms a basic block if:
* The instruction in each position dominates (always executes before) all those in later positions.
* No other instruction executes between two instructions in the sequence.
This definition is more general than the intuitive one in some ways. For example, it allows unconditional jumps to labels not targeted by other jumps. This definition embodies the properties that make basic blocks easy to work with when constructing an algorithm.

The blocks to which control may transfer after reaching the end of a block are called that block&#x27;s &quot;successors&quot;, while the blocks from which control may have come when entering a block are called that block&#x27;s &quot;predecessors&quot;. The start of a basic block may be jumped to from more than one location.

==Creation algorithm==
The algorithm for generating basic blocks from a listing of code is simple: the analyser scans over the code, marking &quot;block boundaries&quot;, which are instructions that may either begin or end a block because they either transfer control or accept control from another point. Then, the listing is simply &quot;cut&quot; at each of these points, and basic blocks remain.

Note that this method does not always generate &quot;maximal&quot; basic blocks, by the formal definition, but they are usually sufficient (maximal basic blocks are basic blocks that cannot be extended by including adjacent blocks without violating the definition of a basic block).

Input: A sequence of instructions (mostly three-address code).

Output: A list of basic blocks with each three-address instruction in exactly one block.

# Identify the leaders in the code. Leaders are instructions that come under any of the following 3 categories:
## It is the first instruction. The first instruction is a leader.
## The target of a conditional or an unconditional goto/jump instruction is a leader.
## The instruction that immediately follows a conditional or an unconditional goto/jump instruction is a leader.
# Starting from a leader, the set of all following instructions until and not including the next leader is the basic block corresponding to the starting leader. Thus every basic block has a leader.

Instructions that end a basic block include the following:
* unconditional and conditional branches, both direct and indirect;
* returns to a calling procedure;
* instructions that may throw an exception;
* function calls can be at the end of a basic block if they can not return, such as functions that throw exceptions or special calls like C&#x27;s codice_1 and codice_2.

Instructions that begin a new basic block include the following:
* procedure and function entry points;
* targets of jumps or branches;
* &quot;fall-through&quot; instructions following some conditional branches;
* instructions following ones that throw exceptions;
* exception handlers.

Note that, because control can never pass through the end of a basic block, some instructions may have to be modified to find the basic blocks. In particular, fall-through conditional branches must be changed to two-way branches, and function calls throwing exceptions must have unconditional jumps added after them. Doing these may require adding labels to the beginning of other blocks.

<text>In computing, binary translation is a form of binary recompilation where sequences of instructions are translated from a source instruction set to the target instruction set. In some cases such as instruction set simulation, the target instruction set may be the same as the source instruction set, providing testing and debugging features such as instruction trace, conditional breakpoints and hot spot detection.

The two main types are static and dynamic binary translation. Translation can be done in hardware (for example, by circuits in a CPU) or in software (e.g. run-time engines, static recompiler, emulators).

== Motivation ==
Binary translation is motivated by a lack of a binary for a target platform, the lack of source code to compile for the target platform, or otherwise difficulty in compiling the source for the target platform.

Statically recompiled binaries run potentially faster than their respective emulated binaries, as the emulation overhead is removed. This is similar to the difference in performance between interpreted and compiled programs in general.

== Static binary translation ==
A translator using static binary translation aims to convert all of the code of an executable file into code that runs on the target architecture without having to run the code first, as is done in dynamic binary translation. This is very difficult to do correctly, since not all the code can be discovered by the translator. For example, some parts of the executable may be reachable only through indirect branches, whose value is known only at run-time.

One such static binary translator uses universal superoptimizer peephole technology (developed by Sorav Bansal and Alex Aiken from Stanford University) to perform efficient translation between possibly many source and target pairs, with considerably low development costs and high performance of the target binary. In experiments of PowerPC-to-x86 translations, some binaries even outperformed native versions, but on average they ran at two-thirds of native speed.

=== Examples for static binary translations ===
Honeywell provided a program called the Liberator for their Honeywell 200 series of computers; it could translate programs for the IBM 1400 series of computers into programs for the Honeywell 200 series.

In 2014, an ARM architecture version of the 1998 video game &quot;StarCraft&quot; was generated by static recompilation and additional reverse engineering of the original x86 version.
The Pandora handheld community was capable of developing the required tools on their own and achieving such translations successfully several times.

For instance, a successful x86-to-x64 static recompilation was generated for the procedural terrain generator of the video game &quot;Cube World&quot; in 2014.

Another example is the NES-to-x86 statically recompiled version of the videogame &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; which was generated under usage of LLVM in 2013.

In 2004 Scott Elliott and Phillip R. Hutchinson at Nintendo developed a tool to generate &quot;C&quot; code from Game Boy binary that could then be compiled for a new platform and linked against a hardware library for use in airline entertainment systems.

In 1995 Norman Ramsey at Bell Communications Research and Mary F. Fernandez at Department of Computer Science, Princeton University developed &quot;The New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit&quot; that had the basic tools for static assembly translation.

== Dynamic binary translation ==
Dynamic binary translation (DBT) looks at a short sequence of code—typically on the order of a single basic block—then translates it and caches the resulting sequence. Code is only translated as it is discovered and when possible, and branch instructions are made to point to already translated and saved code (memoization).

Dynamic binary translation differs from simple emulation (eliminating the emulator&#x27;s main read-decode-execute loop—a major performance bottleneck), paying for this by large overhead during translation time. This overhead is hopefully amortized as translated code sequences are executed multiple times.

More advanced dynamic translators employ dynamic recompilation where the translated code is instrumented to find out what portions are executed a large number of times, and these portions are optimized aggressively. This technique is reminiscent of a JIT compiler, and in fact such compilers (e.g. Sun&#x27;s HotSpot technology) can be viewed as dynamic translators from a virtual instruction set (the bytecode) to a real one.

=== Examples for dynamic binary translations in software ===
* Apple Computer implemented a dynamic translating emulator for M68K code in their PowerPC line of Macintoshes, which achieved a very high level of reliability, performance and compatibility (see Mac 68K emulator). This allowed Apple to bring the machines to market with only a partially native operating system, and end users could adopt the new, faster architecture without risking their investment in software. Partly because the emulator was so successful, many parts of the operating system remained emulated. A full transition to a PowerPC native operating system (OS) was not made until the release of Mac OS X (10.0) in 2001. (The Mac OS X &quot;Classic&quot; runtime environment continued to offer this emulation capability on PowerPC Macs until Mac OS X 10.5.)
* Mac OS X 10.4.4 for Intel-based Macs introduced the Rosetta dynamic translation layer to ease Apple&#x27;s transition from PPC-based hardware to x86. Developed for Apple by Transitive Corporation, the Rosetta software is an implementation of Transitive&#x27;s QuickTransit solution.
* QuickTransit during its product lifespan also provided SPARC→x86, x86→PowerPC and MIPS→Itanium 2 translation support.
* DEC achieved similar success with its translation tools to help users migrate from the CISC VAX architecture to the Alpha RISC architecture.
* HP ARIES (Automatic Re-translation and Integrated Environment Simulation) is a software dynamic binary translation system that combines fast code interpretation with two phase dynamic translation to transparently and accurately execute HP 9000 HP-UX applications on HP-UX 11i for HPE Integrity Servers. The ARIES fast interpreter emulates a complete set of non-privileged PA-RISC instructions with no user intervention. During interpretation, it monitors the application&#x27;s execution pattern and translates only the frequently executed code into native Itanium code at runtime. ARIES implements two phase dynamic translation, a technique in which translated code in first phase collects runtime profile information which is used during second phase translation to further optimize the translated code. ARIES stores the dynamically translated code in memory buffer called code cache. Further references to translated basic blocks execute directly in the code cache and do not require additional interpretation or translation. The targets of translated code blocks are back-patched to ensure execution takes place in code cache most of the time. At the end of the emulation, ARIES discards all the translated code without modifying the original application. The ARIES emulation engine also implements Environment Emulation which emulates an HP 9000 HP-UX application&#x27;s system calls, signal delivery, exception management, threads management, emulation of HP GDB for debugging, and core file creation for the application.
* DEC created the FX!32 binary translator for converting x86 applications to Alpha applications.
* Sun Microsystems&#x27; Wabi software included dynamic translation from x86 to SPARC instructions.
* In January 2000, Transmeta Corporation announced a novel processor design named Crusoe. From the FAQ on their web site, 
* Intel Corporation developed and implemented an IA-32 Execution Layer - a dynamic binary translator designed to support IA-32 applications on Itanium-based systems, which was included in Microsoft Windows Server for Itanium architecture, as well as in several flavors of Linux, including Red Hat and Suse. It allowed IA-32 applications to run faster than they would using the native IA-32 mode on Itanium processors.
* Dolphin (an emulator for the GameCube/Wii) performs JIT recompilation of PowerPC code to x86 and AArch64.
* Microsoft Virtual PC supports binary translation for 32-bit guest operating systems.
* VMware Workstation 12 or earlier are known to support binary translation for 32-bit guest operating systems.

=== Examples for dynamic binary translations in hardware ===
* Nvidia Tegra K1 Denver translates ARM instructions over a slow hardware decoder to its native microcode instructions and uses a software binary translator for hot code.

<text> (Latin for &quot;master of soldiers&quot;; : ) was a top-level military command used in the late Roman Empire, dating from the reign of Constantine the Great. The term referred to the senior military officer (equivalent to a war theatre commander, the emperor remaining the supreme commander) of the empire. In Greek sources, the term is translated either as &quot;strategos&quot; or as &quot;stratelates&quot; (although these terms were also used non-technically to refer to commanders of different ranks).

== Establishment and development of the command ==

The office of &quot;magister militum&quot; was created in the early 4th century, most likely when the Western Roman emperor Constantine the Great defeated all other contemporary Roman emperors, which gave him control over their respective armies. Because the Praetorian Guards and their leaders, the Praetorian Prefects, had supported Constantine&#x27;s enemy, Maxentius, he disbanded the Guard and deprived the Prefects of their military functions, reducing them to a purely civil office. To replace them, he created two posts: a commander of the infantry, the &quot;magister peditum&quot; (&quot;master of foot&quot;), and a more prestigious cavalry commander, the &quot;magister equitum&quot; (&quot;master of horse&quot;). These offices had precedents in the immediate imperial past, both in function and idea; the latter title had existed since republican times, as the second-in-command to a Roman &quot;dictator&quot;.

Under Constantine&#x27;s successors, the titles were also established at a territorial level: &quot;magistri peditum&quot; and &quot;magistri equitum&quot; were appointed for every praetorian prefecture (&quot;per Gallias&quot;, &quot;per Italiam&quot;, &quot;per Illyricum&quot;, &quot;per Orientem&quot;), and, in addition, for Thrace and, sometimes, Africa. On occasion, the offices would be combined in a single person, then styled &quot;magister equitum et peditum&quot; or &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot; (&quot;master of both forces&quot;). Overall, lower-level &quot;magistri&quot; were assigned according to circumstances, with varying numbers employed in a given area. Some were directly in command of the local mobile field army of the &quot;comitatenses&quot;, which acted as a rapid reaction force. Other &quot;magistri&quot; remained at the immediate disposal of the emperors, and by the late fourth century or early fifth century were termed &quot;in praesenti&quot; (&quot;in the presence&quot; of the emperor).

Over the course of the fourth century in the Western Roman Empire, the system of two imperial &quot;magistri&quot; remained largely intact, with usually one &quot;magister&quot; having paramount authority (such as Bauto or Merobaudes, the main power behind the appointment of emperor Valentinian II.) This tendency culminated in Arbogast, who inherited the position of western &quot;magister militum&quot; and used it to functionally usurp emperor Valentinian II, either killing him or driving him to suicide before appointing his own puppet emperor, Eugenius. In the west, the position (often under the title of &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot; or MVM) remained very powerful until the formal end of the empire, and was held by Stilicho, Aetius, Ricimer, and others.

In the east, emperor Theodosius I (379-395) expanded the system of two &quot;magistri militum&quot; to include an additional three &quot;magistri&quot;. For a long time these generals were used in an ad hoc manner, being employed wherever they were needed. Eventually in the fifth century their positions became more firmly established, and there were two senior generals, who were each appointed to the office of &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot;.

During the reign of Emperor Justinian I, with increasing military threats and the expansion of the Eastern Empire, the posts of the eastern generals were overhauled: the &quot;magister militum per Armeniam&quot; in the Armenian and Caucasian provinces, formerly part of the jurisdiction of the &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot;, the &quot;magister militum per Africam&quot; in the reconquered African provinces (534), with a subordinate &quot;magister peditum&quot;, and the &quot;magister militum Spaniae&quot; (c. 562).

In the course of the 6th century, internal and external crises in the provinces often necessitated the temporary union of the supreme regional civil authority with the office of the &quot;magister militum&quot;. In the establishment of the &quot;exarchates&quot; of Ravenna and Carthage in 584, this practice found its first permanent expression. Indeed, after the loss of the eastern provinces to the Muslim conquest in the 640s, the surviving field armies and their commanders formed the first &quot;themata&quot;.

Supreme military commanders sometimes also took this title in early medieval Italy, for example in the Papal States and in Venice, whose Doge claimed to be the successor to the Exarch of Ravenna.

==Later, less formal use of the term==

The term is referred to by Emperor Constantine VII in his De Administrando Imperio in a digression on 6th century Italian history, where he refers to &quot;mastromilis&quot; meaning &#x27;captain-general of the army&#x27; in the &#x27;Roman tongue&#x27;. By the time of writing in the mid-10th century working knowledge of Latin was mostly absent in the Byzantine imperial court.

By the 12th century, the term was being used to describe a man who organized the military force of a political or feudal leader on his behalf. In the &quot;Gesta Herwardi&quot;, the hero is several times described as &quot;magister militum&quot; by the man who translated the original Old English account into Medieval Latin. It seems possible that the writer of the original version, now lost, thought of him as the &quot;hereward&quot;&#x27; ( and ) – the supervisor of the military force. That this later use of these terms was based on the classical concept seems clear.

<text>The collared crow (Corvus torquatus), also known as the ring-necked crow or white-collared crow, is a member of the family Corvidae native to China and north of Vietnam.

==Description==
It is about 52–55 cm in length—the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow (&quot;C. corone&quot;), with proportionately slightly longer wings, tail and bill. A sleek and handsome bird, it has glossy black plumage except for the back of the neck, upper back (mantle), and a broad band around the lower breast that is white. The bill, legs and feet are black.

It sometimes flies with its feet hanging down below the body in a characteristically &quot;lazy&quot; way.

The voice is a loud &quot;kaaar&quot; repeated several times with other slight variations on it to suit the occasion. It also like many other corvids, utters strange clipping and clicking sounds during its head bowing display to another bird.

==Distribution and ecology==
The range of this species is essentially China, covering large areas of the country though not further north than Beijing. It occurs in plains and low lying river valleys in fairly open country and cultivated regions and is a common sight in paddy fields. It tends to avoid large towns and cities and is predominantly a rural species.

Food is sought mainly on the ground where a large range of items are taken, such as insects, mollusks and other invertebrates (even from shallow water), grains, especially rice and it also searches among refuse for suitable food items left by humans. It appears to take less carrion than other species but will if the opportunity arises, and will also take eggs and nestlings.

The nest is usually in a tree and is plastered with mud. There are usually 3–4 eggs laid.

It was classified as least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2004 before being upgraded to near threatened status in 2008. It is considered a vulnerable species as of 2018.

<text>The Chapel Royal in Dublin Castle is a 19th-century Gothic revival chapel which served as the official Church of Ireland chapel of the Household of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1814 until the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922, which terminated the office of Lord Lieutenant. In 1943, the chapel was reconsecrated as a Catholic place of worship and rededicated as the Church of the Most Holy Trinity, but it has not been used for worship since 1983.

==Construction==
Designed by Francis Johnston (1760–1829), the foremost architect working in Ireland in the early 19th century, and architect to the Board of Works, the chapel contains one of the finest Gothic revival interiors in Ireland. Replacing an earlier undistinguished 18th-century church that suffered structural problems through being built on soft ground close to the site of the original castle moat, the new Chapel Royal was built using a timber frame to make it as light as possible. Indeed, so difficult was the nature of the site that the chapel took seven years to build, though a contributory factor in both time and budget was the &quot;sheer opulence&quot; of its interior.

The foundation stone was laid by the 6th Duke of Bedford, the then Lord Lieutenant, on 15 February 1807. It was completed behind schedule (the budget also substantially overran) and opened on Christmas Day, 1814, when the 1st Viscount Whitworth (later created the 1st Earl Whitworth) was Lord Lieutenant. Lord Whitworth contributed the centre portion of the large stained-glass window above the altar, which he had purchased while in Paris, and which reputedly had come from Russia (he had been plenipotentiary in St. Petersburg in the 1790s). The surroundings are painted glass, executed by a Mr Bradley in Dublin. At the apex of the window are the arms of Lord Whitworth.

The decoration of the ceiling of the interior was done by George Stapleton (son of Michael Stapleton), a leading stuccodore of the time, while sculptor Edward Smyth (responsible for the &quot;river heads&quot; on the Custom House) and his son John Smyth (responsible for the statues on the GPO) carved the larger figures. Over the chancel window are three life-size figures representing Faith, Hope and Charity. Over the galleries are heads representing Piety and Devotion. All the interior vaulting and columns are cast in timber and feature a paint wash (&quot;faux pierre&quot;) to give the effect of stone. It was described as having &quot;the most flamboyant and luxurious Dublin interior of its era.&quot;

The exterior was clad in a thin layer of &quot;fine limestone from Tullamore quarry&quot;, and famously features over 90 carved heads, including those of Brian Boru, St. Patrick, Archbishop Ussher and Jonathan Swift, done by Edward and John Smyth.

==Historical features==

This was the third chapel in the castle, and the second on this spot, since medieval times. Before the completion of the Chapel Royal, the Lords Lieutenant their entourage and hangers-on sometimes attended St. Werburgh&#x27;s Church at the rear of the Castle to the west. The enormous pulpit that used to dominate the Chapel Royal has now been removed to St. Werburgh&#x27;s.

Behind one of the galleries is a passage that leads to the bedrooms in the State Apartments. This was used by the Lord Lieutenant and his entourage when they were staying at the Castle. His pew (or throne) was in the centre of the right-hand gallery. Directly facing him was the place for the bishop. Lord Whitworth&#x27;s arms appear directly at the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s position, a most prominent spot.

The organ case was constructed in 1857 to house a new organ by William Telford of Dublin, which replaced an earlier instrument by William Gray of London installed in 1815. A new organ was built by the firm Gray and Davison in 1900 into the same case. Although the case was restored in 2008, the organ is no longer playable as the pipework and mechanisms have been removed.

As each Lord Lieutenant left office, their coat of arms was carved on the gallery, and then, when space ran out, placed in a window of the chapel. It was noted by Irish nationalists that the last window available was taken up by the man who proved to be the last Lord Lieutenant, the 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent (himself a Catholic).

==Present day==
In 1943, the Chapel was consecrated by Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid as a Catholic military church, and in 1944 was renamed the Church of the Most Holy Trinity. The Stations of the Cross were carved by the monks in Glenstal Abbey and presented to the church in 1946. Increasing structural problems caused its closure in the early 1980s. The building was restored and reopened in the early 1990s, although it has not since been used for worship. It is occasionally used for concerts and other events.

The Chapel was used in the television series &quot;The Tudors&quot; for scenes including the trial of Thomas More.

<text>Orion Releasing, LLC (doing business as Orion Pictures) is an American film production and distribution company owned by the Amazon MGM Studios subsidiary of Amazon. 

It was founded in 1978 as Orion Pictures Corporation, a joint venture between Warner Bros. and three former senior executives at United Artists. The company produced and released films from 1978 through 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was one of the largest mini-major studios during its early years, when it worked with prominent directors such as Woody Allen, James Cameron, Jonathan Demme, and Oliver Stone. Four films distributed by Orion won Academy Awards for Best Picture: &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991).

In 1997, Orion was acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which revived the Orion name for television in 2013 and relaunched Orion Pictures a year later. In 2022, Amazon acquired Orion when it acquired MGM.

==History==
===1978–1981: Beginnings===
In January 1978, three executives of Transamerica (TA)-owned studio United Artists (UA)—Arthur B. Krim (chairman), Eric Pleskow (president and chief executive officer), and Robert Benjamin (chairman of the finance committee)—quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951 and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967 and, within a decade, a rift formed between Krim and Transamerica chairman John R. Beckett concerning the studio&#x27;s operations. Krim suggested spinning off United Artists into a separate company which was rejected by Beckett.

The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica&#x27;s offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened when &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA in which Beckett had stated that, if the executives disliked the parent company&#x27;s treatment of them, they should resign. Krim, Benjamin and Pleskow quit United Artists on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein and Mike Medavoy three days later. The week following the resignations, according to the website &quot;Reference for Business&quot;, 63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The &#x27;fatal mistake&#x27; came true following the box-office disaster of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; in 1980 which led to Transamerica selling UA to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

In February 1978, the five men forged a deal with Warner Bros. The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named after the constellation which they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven or eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal had been successfully implemented at United Artists. Orion held a $100 million line of credit and its films would be distributed by the Warner Bros. studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.

In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract, a two-picture deal with John Travolta&#x27;s production company. Contracts with actress and director Barbra Streisand; actors James Caan, Jane Fonda, Peter Sellers, Jon Voight, and Burt Reynolds; directors Francis Ford Coppola and Blake Edwards; writer/director John Milius; singer Peter Frampton; and producer Ray Stark soon materialized. Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal with EMI Films. In its first year, Orion had fifteen films in production and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers lining up to sign with them.

In October 1979, Benjamin died. Orion&#x27;s first film, &quot;A Little Romance&quot;, was released in April that year. Later that year, Orion released Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;10&quot; which became a commercial success, the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; franchise). Other films released by Orion over the next two years included a few successes such as &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980) and &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981); critically praised but underperforming films such as &quot;The Great Santini&quot; (1979), an adaptation of a Pat Conroy novel, and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981); and pictures by young writer-directors such as Philip Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderers&quot; (1979) and Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s debut &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979); plus &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979) which Orion only distributed in the United States. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit. Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) for that reason.

===1982–1986: Split from Warner Bros.===
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner Bros. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion&#x27;s films made up to that point were sold to Warner Bros. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked into Allied Artists and Embassy Pictures before settling on Filmways. Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways&#x27; non-entertainment assets (Grosset &amp; Dunlap and Broadcast Electronics) were sold off.

Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion&#x27;s biggest TV hit was &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, which lasted seven seasons on CBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house division Orion Classics with executives who had previously run United Artists Classics.

Out of the initial 18 films released by the firm under the name of Orion Pictures Corporation, ten made profits, five just managed to cover their costs, and three suffered losses under $2 million. One such film, Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;, was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment. &quot;We&#x27;ve had some singles and doubles [but haven&#x27;t] had any home runs,&quot; lamented Krim. In September 1984, Orion distributed &quot;Amadeus&quot;, which garnered many accolades, winning eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. That year, on April 3, 1984, Orion Pictures launched Orion Entertainment Group, that would consist of four groups, Orion Television, Orion Home Video, Orion Pay Television and Orion Television Syndication, and the new organization would produce and distribute product for television, home video, pay and syndicated markets, with Jamie Kellner serving as president. On October 26, 1984, the company released the James Cameron-directed science fiction film &quot;The Terminator&quot; which was well received by critics and audience and led to a franchise involving five further films. However, Orion distributed none of the follow-ups.

For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films, &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; and &quot;Code of Silence&quot;, made less than $10 million at the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at a James Bond-type franchise, &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot;. Orion&#x27;s haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling home-use rights to its films. Furthermore, the production of the Rodney Dangerfield comedy &quot;Back to School&quot; was put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.

In January 1986, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, producers of the &quot;Rambo&quot; films (the first film, &quot;First Blood&quot;, was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio&#x27;s stock through the duo&#x27;s company, Anabasis. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim. Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stock was acquired by Viacom International. Viacom hoped to use Orion&#x27;s product for its pay-TV channel Showtime. Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation in 1985, which began distributing videos under the Orion Home Video label in 1987 (before OHV&#x27;s formation, HBO Video and their predecessors, as well as former Orion&#x27;s partner Warner Home Video, Vestron Video and Embassy Home Entertainment, had been responsible for home media releases of Orion product).

===1986–1991: Metromedia era===
On May 22, 1986, a 6.5% stake in Orion was purchased by Metromedia, a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim&#x27;s) John Kluge. Metromedia had just divested its television station group to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation (which would form what is now the Fox network). Kluge&#x27;s investment in Orion came at the right time; &quot;Back to School&quot; was a success that earned $90 million at the box office. By March 1987, the studio&#x27;s fortunes had increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, including &quot;Platoon&quot; (which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, and the sports film &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. Orion&#x27;s 1986 offerings drew 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio. In 1987, Orion achieved further success with &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;No Way Out&quot;. By this time, Orion&#x27;s television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name Century Towers Productions, a reference to Orion&#x27;s street address. It produced revivals of format inherited from Heatter-Quigley Productions, owned since the late 1960s by Filmways; this included &quot;The New Hollywood Squares&quot;, which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival of &quot;High Rollers&quot; that aired in the 1987–88 season. 1987 also saw the arrival of former CBS/Fox Video executive Len White, who became president and CEO of Orion Home Video, with plans to release its first home video titles in the third or fourth quarter of that year; he reported to Larry Hilford, who joined the home video division two years earlier.

In January 1987, Kluge faced competition with the arrival of Sumner Redstone, whose theater chain, National Amusements, purchased 6.42 percent of Orion&#x27;s stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake to 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, touching off a battle with Redstone over control of the company. Kluge won on May 20, 1988, when Metromedia took over about 67% of Orion. One analyst told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;: &quot;This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn&#x27;t matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend.&quot;

In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing dead last among larger Hollywood studios by box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year were &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, a biography of Jerry Lee Lewis starring Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder; &quot;She-Devil&quot;, a dark comedy starring Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr; &quot;Speed Zone&quot;, an action-comedy vehicle for &quot;SCTV&quot; alumni John Candy, Joe Flaherty, and Eugene Levy; and Miloš Forman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, &quot;Valmont&quot;, which competed with &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic comedy &quot;UHF&quot; were so strong that Orion had high expectations for it, but it flopped at the box office (though it later developed a cult following on video). Also that year, it signed a deal with Nelson Entertainment to distribute titles on videocassette and theatrically.

In February 1990, Orion signed a deal with Columbia Pictures Entertainment in which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion&#x27;s movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory. That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head of Tri-Star Pictures.

The box-office returns for Orion&#x27;s 1990 releases were just as dismal, with failures in &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; and &quot;State of Grace&quot;. The only bright spot was Kevin Costner&#x27;s western epic &quot;Dances with Wolves,&quot; which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge&#x27;s continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.

===1991–1995: Bankruptcy===
Kluge first attempted to sell Orion to businessman (and former 20th Century Fox owner) Marvin Davis. Sony, which had recently purchased Columbia Pictures, was also interested. When those talks fell through, Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such as &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (which went to Paramount, though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge&#x27;s people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim. Orion&#x27;s financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, host Billy Crystal made reference to Orion&#x27;s debt in his opening monologue, joking that &quot;&quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; [is] about a woman in a coma, &quot;Awakenings&quot; [is] about a man in a coma; and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; [was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma.&quot;

It was during this time that ABC stepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV&#x27;s shows it had in production, such as &quot;American Detective&quot; and &quot;Equal Justice&quot;. After Orion had to shut the television division down, this resulted in projects like &quot;The Chuck Woolery Show&quot;, which was planned to be produced by Orion, instead having to find new production companies (such as Group W Productions in the case of Woolery). Gary Nardino, former employee of Orion Television Entertainment, moved on to producing for Lorimar Television, taking some of Orion&#x27;s projects with him, including &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventures&quot; on Fox, and &quot;Hearts are Wild&quot;, a co-production with Spelling Television, for CBS; talent deals Orion Television had at the time (with Thomas Carter, Robert Townsend, Paul Stajonovich, Clifton Campbell and Deborah Joy Levine) were also taken by Nardino to Lorimar. On November 25, 1991, Orion sold its &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; format rights to King World Productions after Orion closed down its television division.

On December 11, 1991, Orion filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That same month, Orion was in talks with New Line Cinema, a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price. Republic Pictures and the then-new Savoy Pictures also attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.

In February 1992, Bernstein, who was president and chief executive of Orion at that point, resigned from the studio, Bernstein would go on to become executive vice president at Paramount Pictures.

At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise:

&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; swept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.

In May 1992, it was reported that Pleskow was resigning from Orion on July 1 of that year. stating in the New York Times: &quot;There is little for me to do at this point&quot;.

On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.

Orion&#x27;s bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them: &quot;Love Field&quot; (1992), &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; (1993), &quot;The Dark Half&quot; (1993), &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (1994), &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (1994), &quot;Clifford&quot; (1994), &quot;The Favor&quot; (1994), and &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot; (1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization. &quot;Blue Sky&quot; won star Jessica Lange an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.

In August 1994, Orion Home Video partnered with Streamline Pictures in distributing the latter&#x27;s licensed anime video titles to general retailers, which animation historian Fred Patten considered a major development in anime&#x27;s growing popularity in American pop culture.

===1995–1997: Metromedia International Group===
In November 1995, Orion, two other companies controlled by Kluge, and film and TV house MCEG Sterling (producer of the &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; series) were merged to form the Metromedia International Group. Few of the films released during the four years after bankruptcy protection were successful either critically or commercially.

In 1996, Metromedia acquired production company Motion Picture Corporation of America, and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.

In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, including LIVE Entertainment. Orion Classics, minus its founders (who had moved to Sony Pictures Entertainment and founded Sony Pictures Classics), continued to acquire popular art-house films, such as &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; (1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary with Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment in 1996.

===1997–1999: Acquisition by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion Pictures (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment and Motion Picture Corporation of America) to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion Pictures also brought with it a two-thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal. Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment&#x27;s Landmark Theatre Group. &quot;One Man&#x27;s Hero&quot; (1999) was the last film released by Orion Pictures for 15 years.

MGM kept Orion Pictures intact as a corporation, mostly to avoid its home video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video and began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the two thirds of the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library (which included the Epic film library) from Seagram in 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 home video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video. In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Home Video for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.

===2013–present: Revival===

In 2013, Orion returned to television production (after its original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy period) with a new syndicated court show, &quot;Paternity Court&quot;.

The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014, in front of the trailer for &quot;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&quot; that was released in October. The label&#x27;s first release was the Brazilian film &quot;Vestido pra Casar&quot;.

In September 2015, Entertainment One Films relaunched the Momentum Pictures banner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as the United Kingdom (Momentum&#x27;s country of origin). The initial films under the deal were &quot;The Wannabe&quot;, &quot;Fort Tilden&quot; and &quot;Balls Out&quot;. Other films released by Orion Pictures and Momentum Pictures include &quot;Pocket Listing&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot;.

Starting in September 2016 with &quot;Burn Country&quot;, Orion Pictures and Samuel Goldwyn Films paired in acquiring several films.

Orion Television launched a second court show in the fall of 2017, &quot;Couples Court With The Cutlers&quot;, which features married couple Keith and Dana Cutler presiding over romantic and domestic disputes.

On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who joined from Blumhouse Tilt (distributor of Orion&#x27;s &quot;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&quot; and &quot;The Belko Experiment&quot;) and incidentally got his start at the original Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman would serve as president of the expanded label and report to Jonathan Glickman, president of MGM&#x27;s motion picture group. Under his leadership, the &quot;new&quot; Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, and both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences. Its first release, the young adult romance drama &quot;Every Day&quot;, was released on February 23, 2018.

In May 2018, it was announced that Orion Classics would be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year.

On February 5, 2019, MGM and Annapurna Pictures expanded their US joint distribution venture Mirror, rebranding it as United Artists Releasing. Beginning in April 2019, Orion Pictures&#x27; upcoming titles would be distributed through the UAR banner and Orion&#x27;s theatrical distribution staff will move to UAR. The first Orion film to do so was the remake of &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, which was released on June 21, 2019.

On August 20, 2020, it was announced that Orion would be relaunched again, with its focus shifting to films made by underrepresented filmmakers (including people of color, women, the LGBT community and people with disabilities) as part of the efforts to increase inclusivity in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera, with the hiring of Alana Mayo as the president, replacing Hegeman by October. The first film released with this new focus was &quot;Anything&#x27;s Possible&quot; (previously titled &quot;What If?&quot;), a coming-of-age drama directed by Billy Porter in his directorial debut. This effort continued in 2021 when they, along with Annapurna, acquired the US distribution rights to &quot;On the Count of Three&quot; two weeks after it premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.

On May 17, 2021, online shopping company Amazon entered negotiations to acquire MGM and even made a bid for about $9 billion, with the intention to own the studio&#x27;s library, including Orion&#x27;s films, to grow the Amazon Prime Video catalog. The negotiations were made with Anchorage Capital Kevin Ulrich. On May 26, 2021, it was officially announced that MGM would be acquired by Amazon for $8.45 billion. The merger was finalized on March 17, 2022.

On March 4, 2023, Amazon shut down UAR&#x27;s operations and folded them into MGM, resulting in MGM becoming Orion&#x27;s new domestic distributor, with Warner Bros. Pictures becoming the studio&#x27;s new international distributor. In May 2023, Amazon Studios created Amazon MGM Studios Distribution, an international film and television distribution unit for both MGM and Amazon projects, which will include new projects from Orion. On September 17, 2023, &quot;American Fiction&quot; became the studio&#x27;s first film to win the People&#x27;s Choice Award at that year&#x27;s Toronto International Film Festival.

===Notable films===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Orion&#x27;s output included Woody Allen films, Hollywood blockbusters such as the first &quot;Terminator&quot; and the &quot;RoboCop&quot; films, comedies such as &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot;, &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;, &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;Something Wild&quot;, &quot;UHF&quot;, and the &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; films, and Best Picture Academy Award winners &quot;Amadeus&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

Following is a list of the major Academy Awards (Picture, Director, two Screenplay and four Acting awards) for which Orion films were nominated.

===Orion&#x27;s library today===

Almost all of Orion&#x27;s post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.

Most ancillary rights to Orion&#x27;s back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such films as &quot;10&quot; (1979), &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980), &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981), &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), and &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion—&quot;Lionheart&quot; (1987), &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; (1988), and &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984) (the latter two being Saul Zaentz productions)—are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well. HBO also owns video distribution rights to &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986), as they co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film&#x27;s copyright. &quot;The Wanderers&quot; is owned by the film&#x27;s producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion. Orion also retains a controlling interest in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;, although major rights are now with Lionsgate, which owns the library of presenting studio Zoetrope Corporation.

Woody Allen&#x27;s films &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982) and &quot;Zelig&quot; (1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM, as the rights for them remained with Allen, who sold them to MGM in 2000. Orion releases produced by the Hemdale Film Corporation and Nelson Entertainment are included in MGM&#x27;s library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM did not acquire the Hemdale films (which include &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, and &quot;Platoon&quot;) or the Nelson films (including the &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; films) until MGM bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment (the &quot;Epic library&quot;), which included both companies&#x27; libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held by Paramount Television (the result of a pre-existing deal Nelson had with Viacom), with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television by Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media.

Many of the film and television holdings of The Samuel Goldwyn Company have now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, except &quot;The New Adventures of Flipper&quot; now carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.

MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;High Rollers&quot; the company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the original &quot;Squares&quot;; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned by CBS Television Distribution, successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.

Orion distributed the first Rambo film, &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982). That film, like the rest of the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise, is now owned by StudioCanal as a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor, Carolco Pictures.

<text>The Lelang Commandery was a commandery of the Han dynasty established after it had conquered Wiman Joseon in 108 BC and lasted until Goguryeo conquered it in 313. The Lelang Commandery extended the rule of the Four Commanderies of Han as far south as the Han River in present-day South Korea. South Korean scholars have described its administrative areas as being limited to the Pyongan and Hwanghae regions, whose southern bounds lie roughly 75 miles north of the Han River.

== History ==
===Han dynasty===

In 108 BC, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty conquered the area under King Ugeo, a grandson of King Wiman. The Emperor set up Lelang, Lintun, Xuantu and Zhenfan, known as the Four Commanderies of Han in the northern Korean peninsula and Liaodong peninsula. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; records Lelang belonged to Youzhou, located in northwestern Gojoseon consisted of 25 prefectures, 62,812 houses, and the population was 406,748. Its capital, then the prefecture of Joseon (朝鮮縣, 조선현), was located at modern P&#x27;yŏngyang. (Rakrang 樂浪/락랑, a district in central P&#x27;yŏngyang today, is named after Lelang.)

After Emperor Wu&#x27;s death, Zhenfan and Lintun were abolished and Xuantu was moved to Liaodong. Some prefectures of the abolished commanderies were incorporated into Lelang. Lelang after the consolidation is sometimes called &quot;Greater Lelang commandery&quot;. Since Lelang became too large, the Defender of the Southern Section (南部都尉) was set up to rule the seven prefectures which formerly belonged to Zhenfan. Before that, the Defender of the Eastern Section (東部都尉) was set up to rule former Lintun&#x27;s seven prefectures.

Immigrants mainly from Yan and Qi settled in the former Gojoseon lands and brought with them Chinese culture. Among them, the Wang clan, whose ancestor is said to have fled there from Qi in the 2nd century BC, became powerful.

While the Han dynasty was taken over by Wang Mang, Wang Tiao (王調) started a rebellion and tried to secede from China. In 30 AD, the rebellion was stopped by Wang Zun (王遵), whom Emperor Guangwu appointed as governor. The Han dynasty reasserted its authority over Lelang in the late 1st and 2nd centuries. However, the shortage of human resources caused by the turmoil resulted in the abolishment of the seven eastern prefectures. The administration was left to the Dongye natives, whose chiefs were conferred as marquises.

At the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Gongsun Du, appointed as the Governor of Liaodong in 184, extended his semi-independent domain to the Lelang and Xuantu commanderies. His son Gongsun Kang separated the southern half from the Lelang commandery and established the Daifang commandery sometime between 204 and 220. As a result, the Lelang commandery reverted to its original size.

===Cao Wei===
In 236, under the order of Emperor Ming of Cao Wei, Sima Yi crushed the Gongsun family and annexed Liaodong, Lelang and Daifang to Wei. Sima Yi did not encourage frontier settlers to continue their livelihoods in the Chinese northeast and instead ordered households who wished to return to coastal and central China to do so, evacuating the region of Chinese settlers. The Jin Shu records the number of households in the Korean commanderies of Lelang and Daifeng as 8,600 households, less than a sixth of the figures given in the Hou Han Shu for Lelang (which included Daifeng). Liaodong would be out of Chinese hands for centuries due to the lack of Chinese presence there as a result of the policies the Wei court adopted for the commanderies after the fall of the Gongsun family.

===Jin dynasty===
Lelang was then inherited by the Jin dynasty. Due to bitter civil wars, Jin was unable to control its holdings within the northern section of the Korean peninsula at the beginning of the 4th century and was no longer able to dispatch officials to the frontier commanderies, which were maintained by the dwindling local population of remaining Han Chinese residents. The &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; states that Zhang Tong (張統) of Liaodong, Wang Zun (王遵) of Lelang and over one thousand households decided to break away from Jin and submit to the Xianbei warlord of Former Yan Murong Hui. Murong Hui relocated the remnants of the commandery to the west within Liaodong. Goguryeo annexed the former territory of Lelang in 313. Goguryeo ended Chinese rule over any part of the Korean peninsula by conquering Lelang in 313. After Lelang&#x27;s fall, some commandery residents may have fled south to the indigenous Han polities there, bringing with them their culture that spread to the southern part of the Korean peninsula. With the collapse of the commanderies after four centuries of Chinese rule, Goguryeo and the native polities in the south that became Baekje and Silla began to grow and develop rapidly, heavily influenced by the culture of the Four Commanderies of Han.

Goguryeo absorbed much of what was left of Lelang through its infrastructure, economy, local inhabitants, and advanced culture. Unable to govern the region directly and form a new political center immediately, Goguryeo began to consolidate authority by replacing previous government administrators with its own appointed officials, mostly refugees and exiles from China, the most famous being Dong Shou (冬壽) who was entombed at Anak Tomb No. 3, overtly retaining the previous administrative system of Lelang. In 334 Goguryeo established the fortress and city of Pyongyang-song within the center of the former commandery. Towards the end of the 4th century, in order to focus on the growing threat of Baekje and having checked the power of Former Yan in Liaodong, Goguryeo began to actively strengthen and govern the city. In 427 Goguryeo moved its capital to Pyongyang from its former capital of Ji&#x27;an as the new political center of the kingdom in order to administer its territories more effectively.

== Historical revisionism ==

In the North Korean academic community and some parts of the South Korean academic community, the Han dynasty&#x27;s rule in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula have been denied. Proponents of this revisionist theory claim that the Lelang Commandery actually existed outside of the Korean Peninsula, and place them somewhere on the Liaodong Peninsula instead.

The characterization of Japanese historical and archaeological findings in Korea as imperialist forgeries owes in part to those scholars&#x27; discovery of the Lelang Commandery—by which the Han dynasty administered territory near Pyongyang—and insistence that this Chinese commandery had a major impact on the development of Korean culture. Until the North Korean challenge, it was universally accepted that Lelang was a commandery established by Emperor Wu of Han after he defeated Gojoseon in 108 BCE. To deal with the Han dynasty tombs, North Korean scholars have reinterpreted them as the remains of Gojoseon or Goguryeo. For those artifacts that bear undeniable similarities to those found in Han China, they propose that they were introduced through trade and international contact, or were forgeries, and &quot;should not by any means be construed as a basis to deny the Korean characteristics of the artifacts&quot;. The North Koreans also say that there were two Lelangs, and that the Han actually administered a Lelang on the Liao River on the Liaodong peninsula, while Pyongyang was an &quot;independent Korean state&quot; of Lelang, which existed between the 2nd century BCE until the 3rd century CE. The traditional view of Lelang, according to them, was expanded by Chinese chauvinists and Japanese imperialists.

These hypotheses are considered authoritative in the North Korean academic community, which is supported by some historians in South Korea, but this theory is not recognized at all in the academic circles of the United States, China and Japan. The majority of Korean scholars from the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties considered the location of Lelang county somewhere around today&#x27;s Pyongyang area based on the Korean history record Samguk sagi which referred to the Chinese records on the Han commandries. However, Bak Jiwon (born 1737), a Silhak scholar who visited Qing dynasty in 1780, claimed that the location of commandries were in Liaodong area in his The Jehol Diary. Ri Ji Rin (Lee Ji Rin), a North Korean historian who obtained his Ph.D. in history from Peking University in China, suggests in &quot;Research on Ancient Korea&quot; that based on the initial records of Chinese texts and archaeological findings in Liaodong area, the Han Commanderies were located in Liaodong Peninsula. South Korea Historian Yoon, Nae-Hyun also suggests that the Han commanderies were not in Korean peninsula, claiming that there is no archaeological evidence.

<doc id="218732" wikidata="Q329765" url="?curid=218732" title="Emperor Go-Kōmyō">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 110th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1643 through 1654.

This 17th-century sovereign was named after the 14th-century Nanboku-chō Emperor Kōmyō and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates as &quot;later&quot;, and thus, he could be called the &quot;Later Emperor Kōmyō&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean &quot;the second one&quot;, and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Kōmyō, the second&quot;, or as Kōmyō II&quot;.

==Genealogy==
Before Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was ; and his pre-accession title was .

He was the fourth son of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. His mother was Fujiwara no Mitsuko, the daughter of the Minister of the Left (&quot;Sadaijin&quot;); but he was raised as if he were the son of Tōfuku-mon&#x27;in. His predecessor, Empress Meishō, was his elder paternal half-sister.

Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s Imperial family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace. His family included only one daughter and no son:

*Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi-no-Suke&quot;) : Niwata Hideko (d. 1685; 庭田秀子), Niwata Shigehide&#x27;s daughter
**First daughter: Imperial Princess Takako (1650–1725; 孝子内親王) later Empress Dowager Reiseimon’in (礼成門院)

==Events of Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s life==
Tsuguhito-shinnō was granted the title of Crown Prince; and the following year, he became Emperor when Empress Meishō abdicated. His sister stepped down from the throne and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by the new monarch. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Kōmyō is considered to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). The events during his lifetime shed light on his reign. The years of Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s reign correspond with a period in which Tokugawa Iemitsu and Tokugawa Ietsuna were leaders at the pinnacle of the Tokugawa shogunate.

* April 20, 1633: The birth of an Imperial prince who will become known by the posthumous name of Go-Kōmyō&quot;-tennō&quot;.
* 1641 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 19&quot;): Prince Tsuguhito was named heir; and he was given the title of Crown Prince.
* 1643 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 20, 29th day of the 9th month&quot;): The empress ceded her throne to her brother by abdicating; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his younger brother.
* November 14, 1643 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 20, 3rd day of the 10th month&quot;): Go-Kōmyō accepted the title; and he is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). He was age 11. His reign is considered to have begun.
* 1645 (&quot;Shōhō 2, 23rd day of the 4th month&quot;): The &quot;shōgun&quot; was elevated to the rank of &quot;sadaijin&quot;.
* 1649 (&quot;Keian 2, 20th day of the 2nd month&quot;): There was a major earthquake in Edo.
* 1651 (&quot;Keian 4&quot;): Tokugawa Ietsuna was proclaimed &quot;shōgun&quot;.
* 1652 (&quot;Keian 5, 5th month&quot;): &quot;Nihon Ōdai Ichiran&quot; is first published in Kyoto under the patronage of the tairō Sakai Tadakatsu, lord of the Obama Domain of Wakasa Province.
* 1653 (&quot;Jōō 2, 12th day of the 8th month&quot;): A violent fire destroyed a large part of the imperial palace and many temples which were nearby. Shortly thereafter, several girls, aged 12–14 years, were imprisoned for arson involving this fire as well as other fires in Kyoto.
* 1654 (&quot;Jōō 3, 6th day of the 7th month&quot;): Ingen, a Buddhist priest who would eventually become very influential, arrived at Nagasaki from China. His intention was to reform the practice of Buddhism in Japan.
* October 30, 1654 (&quot;Jōō 3, 20th day of the 9th month&quot;): The emperor died. He was buried at Sennyū-ji on the 15th day of the 10th month. There is a probability that the emperor died of smallpox.

Go-Kōmyō is among those enshrined in the imperial mausoleum, &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined are Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s immediate predecessors, Emperor Go-Mizunoo and Empress Meishō. Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s immediate Imperial successors are also memorialized in this &quot;misasagi&quot;, including Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Nijō Yasumichi, 1635–1647
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Kujō Michifusa, 1647
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Ichijō Akiyoshi, 1647
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Akiyoshi, 1647–1651
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Hisatsugu, 1651–1653
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Mitsuhira, 1653–1663
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Kōmyō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

* &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; (1624–1644)
* &quot;Shōhō&quot; (1644–1648)
* &quot;Keian&quot; (1648–1652)
* &quot;Jōō&quot; (1652–1655)

<doc id="218738" wikidata="Q349414" url="?curid=218738" title="Emperor Go-Sai">
<text>, posthumously honored as , also known as , was the 111th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Go-Sai&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1655 through 1663.

This 17th-century sovereign was named after the 9th-century Emperor Junna and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates as &quot;later&quot;, and thus, he could have been called the &quot;Later Emperor Junna&quot;. Emperor Go-Sai could not pass the throne onto his descendants. For this reason, he was known as the &quot;Go-Saiin&quot; emperor, after an alternate name of Emperor Junna, who had confronted and reached an accommodation with similar issues. This emperor was also called . The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean &quot;the second one&quot;, and thus, this emperor might be identified as &quot;Junna II&quot;. During the Meiji era, the name became just Go-Sai.

==Genealogy==
Before Go-Sai&#x27;s accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or Yoshihito; and his pre-accession title was or &quot;Momozono-no-miya&quot;.

==Events of Go-Sai&#x27;s life==
Nagahito-shinnō became emperor when his emperor-brother died. This death left the throne vacant and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by the new monarch. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Sai is considered to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). The events during his lifetime shed light on his reign. The years of Go-Sai&#x27;s reign correspond with a period in which Tokugawa Ietsuna was the leader at the pinnacle of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Go-Sai married the daughter of the first ; and he succeeded as second Takamatsu-no-miya. Then this Imperial prince became the emperor as a temporary measure until his younger brother, could grow older.

* January 1, 1638: The birth of an Imperial prince who will become known by the posthumous name of Go-Sai&quot;-tennō&quot;.
* January 5, 1655: The death of Go-Kōmyō caused the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) to be passed to his brother; and when the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received, the reign of Emperor Go-Sai was deemed to commence.
* 1655 (&quot;Meireki 1&quot;): The new ambassador of Korea, arrived in Japan.
* March 2–3, 1657 (&quot;Meireki 3, 18–19th days of the 1st month&quot;): Great Fire of Meireki: The city of Edo was devastated by a violent fire.
* 1659 (&quot;Manji 5&quot;): In Edo, construction begins on the Ryōgoku Bridge (&quot;ryōgokubashi&quot;).
* 1661 (&quot;Manji 6&quot;): Imperial Palace in Kyoto is burnt to the ground; and the Gekū at Yamada was seriously damaged by fire.
* March 20, 1662 (&quot;Kanbun 2, 1st day of the 2nd month&quot;): There was a violent earthquake in Kyoto which destroyed the tomb of the Taiko, Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
* 1662 (&quot;Kanbun 2&quot;): Emperor Gosai ordered Tosa Hiromichi 土佐広通 (1561–1633), a Tosa-school disciple, to adopt the name Sumiyoshi (probably in reference to a 13th-century painter, Sumiyoshi Keinin 住吉慶忍), upon assuming a position as official painter for the Sumiyoshi Taisha 住吉大社).
* March 5, 1663 (&quot;Kanbun 3, 26th day of the 1st month&quot;): Emperor Go-Sai abdicated, which meant that the Prince Satohito received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Reigen formally acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

After abdicating, Go-sai put his heart into scholarship and he left behind many books, including the &quot;Water and Sun Collection&quot; (&quot;Suinichishū&quot;, 水日集). He was talented in &quot;waka&quot;; and he had a profound understanding of the classics.

During his reign, because of great fires at the Grand Ise Shrine, Osaka Castle, and the Imperial Palace, among others, the Great &quot;Meireki&quot; Fire, earthquakes in the region, and because of repeated floods, many people blamed the Emperor, saying he lacked moral virtue.

* March 26, 1685 (&quot;Jōkyō 2, 22nd day of the 2nd month&quot;): Former-Emperor Go-Sai died; and a great comet was observed crossing the night sky.

Emperor Go-Sai is enshrined in the imperial mausoleum, &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined are Go-Sai&#x27;s immediate predecessors, Emperor Go-Mizunoo, Empress Meishō and Go-Kōmyō. Go-Sai&#x27;s immediate Imperial successors, including Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono, are enshrined here as well.

At the Kitano Shrine, a tablet over the &quot;Chu-mon&quot; entryway reads &quot;tenmangu&quot; in the calligraphy of Emperor Go-sai.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Sai&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Mitsuhira, 1653–1663
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Sai-tennō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Sai&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Jōō&quot; (1652–1655)
* &quot;Meireki&quot; (1655–1658)
* &quot;Manji&quot; (1658–1661)
* &quot;Kanbun&quot; (1661–1673)

<text>The Ontario Hockey League (OHL; ) is one of the three major junior ice hockey leagues which constitute the Canadian Hockey League. The league is for players aged 16–20. There are currently 20 teams in the OHL: seventeen in Ontario, two in Michigan, and one in Pennsylvania.

The league was founded in 1980 when its predecessor, the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League, formally split away from the Ontario Hockey Association, joining the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League and its direct affiliation with Hockey Canada. The OHL traces its history of Junior A hockey back to 1933 with the partition of Junior A and B. In 1970, the OHA Junior A League was one of five Junior A leagues operating in Ontario. The OHA was promoted to Tier I Junior A for the 1970–71 season and took up the name Ontario Major Junior Hockey League. Since 1980 the league has grown rapidly into a high-profile marketable product, with many games broadcast on television and radio.

==History==
Leagues for ice hockey in Ontario were first organized in 1890 by the newly created Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). In 1892 the OHA recognized junior hockey - referring to skill rather than age. In 1896 the OHA moved to the modern age-limited junior hockey concept, distinct from senior and intermediate divisions. Since then the evolution to the Ontario Hockey League has developed through four distinct eras of junior-aged non-professional hockey in Ontario. In 1933, the junior division was divided into two levels, Junior A and Junior B. In 1970 the Junior A level was divided into two levels, Tier I (or Major Junior A) and Tier II (or Minor Junior A). In 1974 the Tier I/Major Junior A group separated from the OHA and became the independent Ontario Major Junior Hockey League (OMJHL). In 1980, the OMJHL became the Ontario Hockey League.

The OHL split from the OHA in July 1982. The OHA and OHL disagreed on financial terms of affiliation, then the OHL decided to handle its own administration. The OHA and the OHL later reached an interim affiliation agreement, which allowed the OHL to compete at the Memorial Cup.

In March 2005, the league announced the launch of OHL Live Stream, resulting in OHL games being broadcast live on a pay-per-view (PPV) broadband basis.

===Timeline of franchises (since 1980)===
Note: The 12 original OHL franchises were all previously members of the OMJHL. Some other franchises played in different junior leagues prior to joining the OHL.
Current teams are listed in blue. Gold stars denote J. Ross Robertson Cup (League championship) winners

==Schedule==

The 20 OHL clubs play a 68-game unbalanced schedule, which starts in the third full week of September, running until the third week of March. Ninety percent (90%) of OHL games are scheduled between Thursday and Sunday to minimize the number of school days missed for its players.

Approximately 20% of players on active rosters in the National Hockey League (NHL) have come from the OHL, and about 54% of NHL players are alumni of the Canadian Hockey League.

===OHL playoffs and Memorial Cup===
The J. Ross Robertson Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the Championship Series. The Cup is named for John Ross Robertson, who was president of the Ontario Hockey Association from 1901 to 1905.

The OHL playoffs consist of the top 16 teams in the league, 8 from each conference. The teams play a best-of-seven game series, and the winner of each series advances to the next round. The final two teams eventually compete for the J. Ross Robertson Cup.

The OHL champion then competes with the winners of the Western Hockey League, the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League, and the host of the tournament to play for the Memorial Cup, which is awarded to the junior hockey champions of Canada. The host team of the tournament is alternated between the three leagues every season. The most recent OHL team to win the Memorial Cup was the Saginaw Spirit in 2024.

==Memorial Cup champions==
The Memorial Cup has been captured 18 times by OHL/OHA teams since the tournament went to a three-league format in 1972:

The Cup was also won 16 times by OHA teams in the period between 1945 and 1971:

==Priority selection==
The OHL&#x27;s predecessor, the OHA, had a midget and juvenile draft dating back to the 50s, until voted out in 1962. In 1966 it was resumed, though not publicized. Starting in the 1970s the draft went through several changes. Originally the draft was for 17-year-old midgets not already associated with teams through their sponsored youth programs. In 1971 the league first allowed &quot;underage&quot; midgets to be picked in the first three rounds. In 1972 disagreements about the Toronto team&#x27;s rights to its &quot;Marlie&quot; players (and Greg Neeld) and claims to American player Mark Howe led to a revised system. In 1973 each team was permitted to protect eight midget area players (Toronto was allowed to protect 10 players from its midget sponsored teams). In 1975 the league phased out the area protections, and the 1976 OHA midget draft was the first in which all midget players were eligible. In 1999 the league changed the draft to a bantam age (15 and 16 year old). It is a selection of players who are residents of the province of Ontario, the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York, and other designated U.S. states east of the Mississippi River plus Missouri.

Prior to 2001, the OHL held the Priority Selection in a public forum, such as an arena. Drafts were attended by many players and family members. In 2001, the OHL decided to hold the &quot;draft&quot; via the internet, greatly reducing the costs the league and its member teams incurred in hosting a public draft. This move reduced the stress and pressure that prospective players faced with a large crowd present.

The Jack Ferguson Award is presented annually to the first overall selection. The award was named in honour of long time OHL scout and former Director of Central Scouting Jack Ferguson.

<text>The Canadian Hockey League (CHL; , LCH) is an umbrella organization that represents the three Canada-based major junior ice hockey leagues. The CHL was founded in 1975 as the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League, and is composed of its three member leagues, the Western Hockey League (WHL), Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). For the 2023–24 season, its three leagues and 60 teams represent nine Canadian provinces (51 teams) as well as four American states (nine teams).

The CHL schedule culminates in the Memorial Cup tournament, which sees each of the three league playoff champions, as well as a host team, play a round-robin tournament to determine a national champion. The CHL also hosts the CHL/USA Prospects Challenge, for the top draft eligible players in the league, and formerly the CHL Canada/Russia Series, a six-game all-star exhibition series against a team of Russian juniors. In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Canadian Hockey League cancelled the event in 2022.

The current president of the CHL is Dan MacKenzie.

==Introduction==

The Canadian Hockey League (CHL) is the governing body for Major Junior hockey (formerly known as Tier One Junior A), the top level of amateur hockey in Canada. The CHL currently oversees the Western Hockey League (WHL), the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), with the OHL and WHL having teams in both Canada and the United States. Each league plays individual regular season schedules, and playoffs. The annual CHL championship is determined by the Memorial Cup tournament held in May.

The CHL is generally considered the world&#x27;s top junior hockey league for developing professional players and is a key supplier of new players and officials for the many North American professional hockey leagues, such as the National Hockey League, American Hockey League, and the ECHL. If a CHL player does not sign a professional contract, many also opt to play for U Sports (formerly Canadian Interuniversity Sport - CIS) and go to school due to CHL sponsored scholarship programs. Due to the use of paying player stipends and allowing junior players that have signed entry-level contracts with the NHL, CHL players were historically considered to be professionals by the NCAA, and thus ineligible to play college hockey in the United States. However, the NCAA changed its position and decided that CHL players were no longer ineligible as of the 2025–26 season. The decision was made after a class action was filed on behalf of a player who was declared ineligible after having played two exhibition games in the OHL when he was 16 years old.

The CHL also seeks to raise the profile of the junior game by hosting annual events such as the Memorial Cup, the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game and the CHL Canada/Russia Series. The organization also provides many scholarships and bursaries for its players who exemplify extraordinary efforts and community involvement. These programs are supported by the many corporate sponsors.

==History==
On May 9, 1975, officials from the Western Canada Hockey League, the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, announced a constitution to establish the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL) composed of the three leagues under one umbrella. The new organization wanted standard contracts for all players, consistent dollar amounts for development fees paid by professional leagues to sign junior players, and for the National Hockey League and the World Hockey Association to work together on a common drafting program to eliminate bidding wars. The CMJHL sought to represent players directly instead of agents, and proposed an escalating development fee schedule if professional teams wanted to sign a player while he was still eligible for junior hockey. The league also proposed to allow some players under professional contracts to continue playing in junior hockey. Ontario&#x27;s commissioner Tubby Schmalz defended the validity of the constitution, despite a challenge from Alan Eagleson that it violated antitrust laws in Canada and the United States.

On July 30, 2019, Dan MacKenzie was announced as the new full-time president as of September 2019, taking over for David Branch. In March 2020, the CHL and its constituent leagues cancelled the remainder of the 2019–20 regular seasons, playoffs and the 2020 Memorial Cup, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in North America.

The QMJHL and WHL played a 2020–21 season with limitations; the WHL played a shortened season consisting exclusively of regional play and no playoffs, with &quot;bubbles&quot; used for all B.C. and East Division games. The QMJHL was the only CHL league to play a full season with playoffs, albeit with disruptions and the use of bubbles due to public health orders in Quebec and travel restrictions in Atlantic Canada. Due to public health orders in Ontario, the OHL indefinitely delayed, and later cancelled the 2020–21 season. The Memorial Cup was cancelled and not awarded for the second consecutive season.

On July 21, 2021, the CHL announced a new national media rights deal with Bell Media and the CBC (replacing a long-standing relationship with Sportsnet), under which TSN (English) and RDS (French) will serve as the CHL&#x27;s national media partners. TSN will carry 30 regular season games per-season, RDS will carry 20 regular season games per-season, and both will carry coverage of selected playoff games and CHL national events (including the Memorial Cup). CBC Sports will also carry coverage of selected games beginning in the 2021–22 season, including a package of early-season games, and a game of the week package on TSN, RDS, and CBC Gem.

=== Exceptional player status ===

Exceptional player status allows skilled, underage hockey players to enter the major junior circuit early. Hockey Canada determines if an underage player is eligible for &quot;exceptional status&quot;. The clause was introduced in the CHL rule book in the 2005–06 season. As of 2024, nine players have been granted exceptional status: John Tavares, Aaron Ekblad, Sean Day, Connor McDavid, Joseph Veleno, Shane Wright, Connor Bedard, Michael Misa, and Landon DuPont. The status has been granted six times to OHL prospects, twice in the WHL, and once in the QMJHL. As of 2024, seven have gone number one in their respective major junior drafts and four have been selected first overall in their respective NHL drafts.

==Annual events==

===Memorial Cup===

The Memorial Cup Tournament is the championship of Junior Canadian hockey. Each year it features the champions from the (WHL, OHL, QMJHL) and the host CHL team. The host team changes from year to year, and is selected by a bidding process prior to the start of each season. The annual event is one of the biggest sporting events in North America, attracting thousands of spectators and generating increasing revenue for both the CHL teams and the host city.
===CHL/USA Prospects Challenge===
The CHL/USA Prospects Challenge is an annual series between the CHL and the USA Hockey National Team Development Program. The two-game series showcases the talents of top prospects for the upcoming NHL entry draft, in a collaborative effort with the NHL Central Scouting Bureau to select the participants.

===CHL Canada/Russia Series===

The CHL Canada/Russia Series is an annual junior ice hockey exhibition tournament held between a select team of Russian players and all-star teams representing the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League, the Ontario Hockey League and the Western Hockey League. The event is organized by the Canadian Hockey League and consists of six games total each year, with the Russian Selects playing two games versus each league&#x27;s all-star team. All games are broadcast nationally in Canada on Sportsnet. The series often features players from the Canadian national junior team, and the Russian national junior team.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Canadian Hockey League cancelled the event in 2022.

===CHL Import Draft===

The CHL Import Draft is an annual event in which every team in the Canadian Hockey League may select the rights to eligible import players. An import is classified as a player whose parents are not residents of Canada or the United States. The draft is conducted online, during the last week of June, or first week of July. Teams from the Western Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League, and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League, systematically take turns making selections in reverse order of the team&#x27;s standings in the CHL from the previous season. Teams can have a maximum of two imports, which may only be obtained through the draft.

==Trophies and awards==

The Canadian Hockey League awards sixteen annual trophies for accomplishments during the regular and at the Memorial Cup to top individuals and teams among its three member leagues. The Memorial Cup is the top award for the championship team at the end-of-season Memorial Cup tournament. A set of five individual awards are given for performance at the tournament. In the regular season, Canadian Hockey League also presents ten annual awards. The nominees for each individual award are determined by the winner of the corresponding award handed out by each of the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s three member leagues.


==Teams==
For the 2023–24 season, the league includes 60 teams located in nine Canadian provinces (51 teams) and four American states (9 teams). Currently, nine of the ten Canadian provinces have a member team. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province without a team.

<text>The Western Hockey League (WHL) is a junior ice hockey league based in Western Canada and the Northwestern United States. The WHL is one of three leagues that constitutes the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) as the highest level of junior hockey in Canada, alongside the Ontario Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. Teams play for the Ed Chynoweth Cup, with the winner moving on to play for the Memorial Cup, Canada&#x27;s national junior championship. WHL teams have won the Memorial Cup 19 times. The WHL is composed of 22 teams divided into two conferences of two divisions. The Eastern Conference comprises 11 teams from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, while the Western Conference comprises 11 teams from British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.

The league was founded in 1966 as the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL), with seven teams in Saskatchewan and Alberta. For its 1967 season, the league was renamed the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL). From 1968, the league was renamed the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), and finally the Western Hockey League from 1978 after the admission of American-based teams to the league.

The league was the brainchild of Bill Hunter, who desired to build a western league capable of competing with the top leagues in Ontario and Quebec. He partnered with Scotty Munro, Del Wilson, and Jim Piggott to make this vision a reality. Originally considered an &quot;outlaw league&quot; by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, the western league was not sanctioned as a top junior league until 1970, when Canadian junior hockey was reorganized.

== History ==
=== Tumultuous beginnings ===
Despite winning the 1966 Memorial Cup, Edmonton Oil Kings&#x27; owner Bill Hunter was growing concerned about the state of junior hockey in Western Canada. Each of the West&#x27;s four provinces had its own junior league, and Hunter felt that this put them at a disadvantage when competing nationally against larger leagues based in Ontario and Quebec. Desiring stronger competition, Hunter&#x27;s Oil Kings were competing in both the Alberta Junior Hockey League and the senior Central Alberta Hockey League. During the 1966 Memorial Cup, Hunter made newspaper headlines when he outlined his vision for a nation-wide junior hockey league competing for the Memorial Cup. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association&#x27;s (CAHA) second vice-president Lloyd Pollock responded by saying that the idea was a pipe dream, and was not feasible while the CAHA was re-negotiating a development agreement with the National Hockey League (NHL).

CAHA informed the Oil Kings that they were required to play full-time in a junior hockey league for the 1966–67 season or would be ineligible to compete for the Memorial Cup. This led Hunter to endorse the suggestion of Estevan Bruins owner Scotty Munro to create a new Western regional junior league. Five members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL)—the Bruins, Moose Jaw Canucks, Regina Pats, Saskatoon Blades, and Weyburn Red Wings—left the SJHL and joined the Oil Kings and the Calgary Buffaloes in forming the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL). Despite concerns that the CMJHL would mean the demise of the Alberta and Saskatchewan leagues—the SJHL did immediately fold—the governing bodies in both provinces sanctioned the new league. However, CAHA did not sanction it, declaring the CMJHL to be an &quot;outlaw league&quot; and suspending its teams and players from participation in CAHA events, including the Memorial Cup. The new league accused CAHA of overstepping its boundaries and, with the support of the players and their families, chose to play the season regardless. The CMJHL began legal action against the CAHA executive in March 1967, fighting to regain eligibility to enter the Memorial Cup tournament.

In May 1967, the CMJHL renamed itself to the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL). The league also added four new teams, including the Swift Current Broncos and three teams based in Manitoba—the Brandon Wheat Kings, Flin Flon Bombers, and Winnipeg Jets. The new CAHA-NHL development agreement came into effect July 1, 1967. The new pact ended direct sponsorship of junior teams by the NHL, which shifted to paying development fees to CAHA, with junior players becoming eligible for the NHL entry draft at age 20. With the agreement settled, CAHA finally sanctioned the WCHL, which allowed for the league champion Estevan Bruins to compete for the 1968 Memorial Cup. However, in May 1968, Hunter announced that the league would use an age limit of 21 in spite of the CAHA-NHL agreement. The WCJHL claimed that the lower age limit decreased its talent pool and negatively impacted ticket sales. In response, CAHA again suspended the league and its players.

In June 1968, the WCJHL changed its name to the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), and announced that it was leaving CAHA to form the rival Canadian Hockey Association (CHA). Hunter became chairman of the board for the WCHL, and Ron Butlin became president of the WCHL and the CHA. Concerns over the WCHL&#x27;s relationship with CAHA and a desire to compete for the Memorial Cup led the Pats, Canucks, and Red Wings to withdraw before the 1968–69 season, and join a revived Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League instead. At the conclusion of the season, the CHA organized its own national championship, which pitted the WCHL-champion Flin Flon Bombers against the St. Thomas Barons from Ontario. The initiative was undermined when the Barons withdrew from the best-of-seven series during the fourth game in protest of alleged violent play on the part of the Bombers. The Bombers, who were awarded the title, proceeded to challenge the Memorial Cup champion-Montreal Junior Canadiens to a championship showdown, but the Montreal team declined.

After years of disputes, Canadian junior hockey was reorganized in 1970, with CAHA absorbing the CHA and re-sanctioning the WCHL, making it one of three top-flight major junior leagues, along with the Ontario Hockey Association—now the Ontario Hockey League—and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League—now the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. Then, in 1972, the format of the Memorial Cup was changed to become a tournament between the champion of each major junior league.

=== Early years ===
The league&#x27;s first decade saw constant expansion and franchise movement as the league spread throughout the west. The Flin Flon Bombers, led by future NHL stars Bobby Clarke and Reggie Leach, became the league&#x27;s first powerhouse team, making three straight finals appearances and winning back-to-back championships in 1969 and 1970. The WCHL became a truly western league in 1971 when the Estevan Bruins moved to British Columbia to become the New Westminster Bruins, joined by the expansion Victoria Cougars and Vancouver Nats.

In the mid-1970s, the Bruins established the WCHL&#x27;s first true dynasty, capturing four consecutive championships between 1975 and 1978. The Bruins also won back-to-back Memorial Cup championships in 1977 and 1978.

In 1976, the Oil Kings, facing pressure from the professional Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association, relocated to Oregon to become the Portland Winter Hawks, marking the WCHL&#x27;s first American club. With the addition of two more American teams in the Seattle Breakers and Billings Bighorns a year later, the WCHL shortened its name to the Western Hockey League. Despite the Flin Flon Bombers&#x27; early success, the remoteness and size of the community increasingly posed a challenge, and in 1978 the team relocated to Edmonton in a brief revival of the Oil Kings—the team would move again a year later and become the Great Falls Americans.

=== The brawling &#x27;80s ===
The 1980s were marked by several brawls that involved police intervention, one of the most bizarre trades in hockey history, and the tragic deaths of four players in a bus crash.

Early in the 1980–81 WHL season, Medicine Hat Tigers manager and coach Pat Ginnell traded blows with a linesman during a bench clearing brawl against the Lethbridge Broncos. Ginnell was found guilty of assault, fined $360, and suspended for 36 games by the WHL. In March 1982, a violent brawl between the Regina Pats and Calgary Wranglers saw the two teams collectively fined $2,250 and players suspended for 73 combined games. Pats coach Bill LaForge would end up in a courtroom later that season when he got into an altercation with a fan. LaForge was acquitted when the judge noted that it was hard to convict a man for assault when faced with &quot;an obnoxious person trying to get into the coach&#x27;s area.&quot; LaForge resigned following the season after serving three separate suspensions.

On January 19, 1983, the Seattle Breakers dealt Tom Martin and $35,000 to the Victoria Cougars for the Cougars&#x27; team bus. The Breakers had been unable to sign Martin, who wanted to play in his home town of Victoria, and the Cougars were unable to use the bus, which they had purchased from the folded Spokane Flyers, because they were unwilling to pay the taxes and duties required to register the vehicle in Canada.

On December 30, 1986, tragedy struck the Swift Current Broncos when their bus slid off an icy highway and rolled on the way to Regina for a game. Scott Kruger, Trent Kresse, Brent Ruff, and Chris Mantyka were killed in the crash. The Broncos retired their numbers and introduced a commemorative patch in remembrance of the four players; in 2016, a memorial was unveiled at the crash site. The WHL later renamed its award for most valuable player as the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy in their honour. In 1989, less than three years after the crash, the Broncos won the league title and the Memorial Cup.

=== The 1990s ===

The 1990s saw another period of expansion and the return of the league to Western Canada&#x27;s major cities. In 1991, the Spokane Chiefs became the second American team to win the Memorial Cup. The Kamloops Blazers established themselves as the WHL&#x27;s second dynasty when they won both the WHL Championship and Memorial Cup three times in four years between 1992 and 1995.

In 1995, the Calgary Hitmen, founded by a group of investors including Bret &quot;the Hitman&quot; Hart, from whom the team got its name, were granted an expansion franchise. Despite early fears that the WHL could not succeed in an NHL city, the Hitmen were a success, averaging as many as 10,000 fans per game by 2004–05. The Hitmen were followed one year later by the Edmonton Ice, but that team failed after only two seasons because of conflicts with the Edmonton Oilers. The team became the Kootenay Ice in Cranbrook, British Columbia, and found better success—including winning the 2002 Memorial Cup—despite being in one of the smallest markets in the league.

=== The twenty-first century ===
In the 2000s, the league expanded four more times. The Vancouver Giants joined in 2001, the Everett Silvertips in 2003, the Chilliwack Bruins in 2005—the team relocated in 2011 and became the Victoria Royals—and the Edmonton Oil Kings in 2007. The Kelowna Rockets established a run of dominance, winning three WHL titles in 2003, 2005, and 2009, and winning the Memorial Cup as host in 2004.

2011 saw WHL teams participate in two outdoor games for the first time. The Spokane Chiefs hosted the Kootenay Ice on January 15, and on February 21, the Calgary Hitmen hosted the Regina Pats for a game in conjunction with the 2011 Heritage Classic. A third outdoor game was hosted by Regina as part of the 2019 Heritage Classic, featuring a rematch against the Hitmen.

The league was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in North America in early 2020. The 2019–20 season was cut short and its playoffs ultimately cancelled due to the pandemic, while the 2020–21 season was played in a modified format, with teams playing 24-game in-division schedules with no playoffs. As such, neither the Ed Chynoweth Cup nor the Memorial Cup were awarded in 2020 or 2021. The league returned to a regular schedule for 2021–22, and the Oil Kings became the first team to win the Ed Chynoweth Cup since the Prince Albert Raiders in 2019.

==Member teams==
The WHL comprises 22 teams divided into two conferences, making it the largest league in the CHL—the Ontario Hockey League has 20 teams and the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League has 18. The WHL has member teams across four Canadian provinces and two American states. The Eastern Conference comprises teams from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. The Western Conference is made up of teams based in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.

The top eight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs, with the division winners declared the top two seeds in the first round of the post-season. In the playoffs, the four remaining teams in each conference are reseeded by regular season points in the second round.

==Player eligibility==
The WHL bantam draft is an annual event in which teams select players from bantam hockey league age groups (i.e. 14 or 15 years old). The order of selection depends on the league&#x27;s standings.

Players aged 15 to 20 are eligible to play in the WHL, with some restrictions. 15-year-olds are permitted to play only five games, unless their midget team&#x27;s season has ended. Meanwhile, each team is allowed to have only three 20-year-olds on their rosters, except for expansion teams, for which five 20-year-olds are eligible to play. Each team is permitted to carry only two non-North American players, and teams have the opportunity to select such players through the CHL Import Draft.

Each of the CHL&#x27;s three member leagues are granted exclusive territorial rights to players from within North America. The WHL holds rights to players from the four western provinces, the American Pacific Northwest, all other American states west of the Mississippi River (except Missouri), and the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.

=== Exceptional status ===
In 2005, the CHL introduced exceptional status, which could be conferred on select players to make them eligible to play full-time in a CHL league as a 15-year-old. In 2020, Connor Bedard became the first player to be granted exceptional status to play in the WHL, and the seventh player overall to have been granted exceptional status since 2005. Bedard was selected by the Regina Pats in the 2020 bantam draft. In 2024, Landon DuPont became the second player to be granted exceptional status for the WHL, and the ninth overall. DuPont was selected by the Everett Silvertips in the 2024 bantam draft.

=== Education ===
With most players joining the league while still attending school, the WHL takes a role in its players educational needs. Teams maintain academic advisors, who monitor the academic progress of players along with the league&#x27;s Director of Education Services. The league also operates a scholarship program that offers one full year of Canadian university tuition, textbooks, and compulsory fees for each season played in the WHL. Since this program was introduced in 1993, more than 3,000 scholarships had been handed out at a total value of by 2008. Canadian universities and colleges thus recruit extensively from the WHL, affording graduating players the opportunity to continue playing hockey in U Sports competition as they attend post-secondary institutions.

Until 2024, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) considered CHL players professionals—due both to the fact that they received stipends and that eligible players could sign National Hockey League contracts—and thus ineligible to participate in college hockey programs in the United States. Players hoping to receive scholarships to American universities thus had to play Junior A hockey in the British Columbia Hockey League or the United States Hockey League, rather than major junior hockey, to retain NCAA eligibility. However, in August 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed by a former CHL player, alleging that the NCAA ban on CHL players violated US anti-trust laws. The following month, Regina Pats forward Braxton Whitehead became the first CHL player to verbally commit to an NCAA team. In November 2024, amid increasing pressure, the NCAA voted to open eligibility to CHL players as of the 2025–26 season, marking a significant departure from longstanding policy.

== Champions and awards ==

=== Memorial Cup Champions ===
WHL teams earn the right to compete in the annual Memorial Cup tournament by winning the WHL playoff championship or, since 1983, by hosting the tournament. Altogether, the Memorial Cup has been won by WHL teams nineteen times since the league&#x27;s founding.

<text>The Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL; , LHJMQ), formerly the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League is one of the three major junior ice hockey leagues that constitute the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). The league includes teams in Quebec and the Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and previously had teams in Newfoundland, and Maine and New York in the United States.

The Gilles-Courteau Trophy is the championship trophy of the league. The QMJHL champion then goes on to compete in the Memorial Cup against the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and Western Hockey League (WHL) champions, and the CHL host team. The QMJHL had traditionally adopted a rapid and offensive style of hockey. Former QMJHL players hold many of the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s career and single season offensive records.

Hockey Hall of Fame alumni of the QMJHL include Mario Lemieux, Guy Lafleur, Ray Bourque, Pat LaFontaine, Mike Bossy, Denis Savard, Michel Goulet, Luc Robitaille, and goaltenders Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur.

==History==
The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League was founded in 1969, through the merger of the best teams from the existing Quebec Junior Hockey League and the Metropolitan Montreal Junior Hockey League, declaring themselves a &quot;major junior&quot; league. Of the original eleven QMJHL teams, eight came from the QJHL, two from the MMJHL, and the Cornwall Royals, from Cornwall, Ontario, near the Quebec border, who transferred from the Central Junior A Hockey League. The Rosemont National and Laval Saints transferred from the MMJHL. The eight teams from the QJHL were the Drummondville Rangers, Quebec Remparts, Saint-Jérôme Alouettes, Shawinigan Bruins, Sherbrooke Castors, Sorel Éperviers, Trois-Rivières Ducs and the Verdun Maple Leafs.

Most of the teams were within a few hours&#x27; drive of Montreal. From the first season in 1969–70, only Shawinigan remains in the same city with an uninterrupted history, although the team&#x27;s name has changed to the Cataractes.

In 1972 the QMJHL had been in operation for three years, and wanted a team in the province&#x27;s largest city. It threatened a lawsuit to force the Montreal Junior Canadiens of the Ontario Hockey Association into the Quebec-based league. Over the summer of 1972, the OHA granted the Junior Habs a &quot;one-year suspension&quot; of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge in the process. The OHA then reactivated the suspended franchise for the 1973–74 season in Kingston, Ontario, under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. 
QMJHL teams have won the Memorial Cup twelve times since 1969, with the Shawinigan Cataractes, Saint John Sea Dogs, the Granby Prédateurs, the Hull Olympiques, Halifax Mooseheads, Rouyn-Noranda Huskies, Rimouski Océanic, and the Acadie-Bathurst Titan each winning once, the Quebec Remparts winning three times(once in their first edition 1969–1985, and twice in their second edition 1997–present) and the Cornwall Royals winning three times.

Starting in 1994, the QMJHL began to expand farther east, outside of Quebec. The &quot;Q&quot; filled the void in Atlantic Canada after the exodus of American Hockey League franchises, when the AHL had a strong presence in the 1980s and 1990s; all of the Maritime Division cities save for Bathurst, New Brunswick are former homes of AHL franchises. To date, Fredericton, New Brunswick is the lone former AHL market that has not established a QMJHL franchise.

In recent seasons, the QMJHL has been scouting players from the Atlantic Canada region along with a surge in players coming out of the New England area: the QMJHL has territorial rights to draft and recruit players from New England as part of an agreement where players from the United States can be drafted by the CHL league that is in a similar geographic area.

In December 2023, the QMJHL changed its name to the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League and released a new logo. The change recognized the league&#x27;s expansion into the Maritime provinces, whose teams had been a part of the QMJHL for almost 30 years.

The QMJHL will return to Newfoundland as of the 2025–26 season, with relocation of the Acadie-Bathurst Titan. The Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly amended labour laws in 2024, to consider junior players as student-athletes and not employees subject to minimum wage, similarly to other provinces in the league.

==Entry draft==
Starting in 1971, the QMJHL has held a draft to select the rights to future players. The league held separate drafts for junior-aged players and for midget-aged players. The initial drafts addressed only players not protected by their territorial programs. In 1972, teams could protect 15 players within their territory, and Mike Bossy was never drafted because the Laval National protected him. In 1973, the midget protection was dropped to five players, then increased to six players in 1976. The territorial rights created issues in 1973, when the Sorel Éperviers picked Lucien DeBlois with the first pick, and the Drummondville Voltigeurs selected him with the 8th pick because he also was within their region. The last year of separate drafts for midget and junior players was 1977, when teams were allowed to protect one midget player. Starting in 1978, the league had a single draft.

<text>The prime minister of France (), officially the prime minister of the French Republic (&quot;Premier ministre de la République française&quot;), is the head of government of the French Republic and the leader of its Council of Ministers.

The prime minister is the holder of the second-highest office in France, after the president of France. The president, who appoints but cannot dismiss the prime minister, can request resignation. The Government of France, including the prime minister, can be dismissed by the National Assembly. Upon appointment, the prime minister proposes a list of ministers to the president. Decrees and decisions signed by the prime minister, like almost all executive decisions, are subject to the oversight of the administrative court system. Some decrees are taken after advice from the Council of State (), over which the prime minister is entitled to preside. Ministers defend the programmes of their ministries to the prime minister, who makes budgetary choices. The extent to which those decisions lie with the prime minister or president often depends upon whether they are of the same political party. If so, the president may serve as both the head of state and &quot;de facto&quot; head of government, while the prime minister serves as his deputy.

The current prime minister is François Bayrou, who was appointed on 13 December 2024.

== Nomination ==
The prime minister is appointed by the president of France, who is theoretically free to pick anyone for the post. In practice, because the National Assembly has the power to force the resignation of the government by adopting a motion of no confidence, the choice of prime minister must reflect the will of the majority in the National Assembly. In periods of cohabitation, the prime minister is only responsible to the parliament.

One example of cohabitation includes President François Mitterrand&#x27;s appointment of Jacques Chirac as prime minister after the legislative election of 1986. While Mitterrand&#x27;s Socialist Party was the largest party in the National Assembly, it did not have an absolute majority. The RPR had an alliance with the Union for French Democracy, which gave them a majority.

While prime ministers are usually chosen from amongst the ranks of the National Assembly, on rare occasions the president has selected a non-officeholder because of experience in bureaucracy or foreign service, or success in business management—former Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin, for example, served as prime minister from 2005 to 2007 without having held elected office.

Although the president&#x27;s choice of prime minister must be in accordance with the majority in the National Assembly, a prime minister does not have to ask for a vote of confidence after a government formation, having been legitimized by the president&#x27;s assignment and approval of the government. Prior to the 1958 Constitution, the government was required to pass a motion of confidence upon entering office.

==Role==
According to article 21 of the Constitution, the prime minister &quot;shall direct the actions of the Government&quot;. Additionally, Article 20 stipulates that the government &quot;shall determine and conduct the policy of the Nation&quot;, and it includes domestic issues, while the president concentrates on formulating directions on national defense and foreign policy while arbitrating the efficient service of all governmental authorities in France. Other members of the government are appointed by the president &quot;on the recommendation of the prime minister&quot;. In practice, the prime minister acts in harmony with the president, except when there is a cohabitation. During cohabitation, according to the Constitutional Council, &quot;the center of gravity of power shifts from the Elysée to Matignon&quot;, with the president losing his status as head of the executive. In such cases, the prime minister traditionally exercises primacy in domestic affairs, while the president limits their action to defense and, to a lesser degree, to foreign affairs.

The prime minister can &quot;engage the responsibility&quot; of the government before the National Assembly. This process consists of placing a bill before the assembly, and either the assembly overthrows the government, or the bill is passed automatically (article 49). In addition to ensuring that the government still has support in the house, some bills that might prove too controversial to pass through the normal assembly rules are able to be passed this way.

The prime minister may also submit a bill that has not been yet signed into law to the Constitutional Council (article 61). Before dissolving the assembly, the president must consult the prime minister and the presidents of both houses of Parliament (article 12). The prime minister is the only member of the government able to introduce legislation in Parliament.

==History==

Under the Third Republic, the French Constitutional Laws of 1875 titled the head of government as the &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot; (), though he was informally called &quot;prime minister&quot; or &quot;premier&quot; outside of France.

The president of the council was vested with similar formal powers to those of the prime minister of the United Kingdom. In practice, this proved insufficient to command the confidence of France&#x27;s multi-party parliament. Most notably, the legislature had the power to force the entire cabinet out of office by a vote of censure. As a result, cabinets were often toppled twice a year, and there were long stretches where France was left with only a caretaker government. Under the circumstances, the president of the council was usually a fairly weak figure whose strength was more dependent on charisma than formal powers. Often, he was little more than , and was more the cabinet&#x27;s chairman than its leader.

After several unsuccessful attempts to strengthen the role in the first half of the twentieth century, a semi-presidential system was introduced under the Fifth Republic. It was at this point that the post was formally named &quot;Prime Minister&quot; and took its present form. The 1958 Constitution includes several provisions intended to strengthen the prime minister&#x27;s position, for instance by restricting the legislature&#x27;s power to censure the government. As a result, a prime minister has only been censured twice during the existence of the Fifth Republic: the first such instance occurred in 1962 when Georges Pompidou was toppled over opposition objections to President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s effort to have the president popularly elected. At the ensuing 1962 French legislative election, de Gaulle&#x27;s coalition won an increased majority, and Pompidou was reappointed prime minister. Thereafter, no government lost a motion of no confidence until 2024, when Michel Barnier&#x27;s minority government was toppled after invoking article 49.3 of the Constitution to adopt the Social Security budget for 2025 without submitting it to a parliamentary vote.

<text>Fly fishing is an angling technique that uses an ultra-lightweight lure called an artificial fly, which typically mimics small invertebrates such as flying and aquatic insects to attract and catch fish. Because the mass of the fly lure is insufficient to overcome air resistance, it cannot be launched far using conventional gears and techniques, so specialized tackles are used instead and the casting techniques are significantly different from other forms of angling. It is also very common for the angler to wear waders, carry a hand net, and stand in the water when fishing.

Fly fishing primarily targets predatory fish that have significant amount of very small-sized prey in their diet, and can be done in fresh or saltwater. North Americans usually distinguish freshwater fishing between cold-water species (trout, salmon) and warm-water species (notably black bass). In Britain, where natural water temperatures vary less, the distinction is between game fishing for trout and salmon versus coarse fishing for other species. Techniques for fly fishing differ with habitat (lakes and ponds, small streams, large rivers, bays and estuaries, and open ocean.)
==Overview==

In fly fishing, fish are caught by using artificial flies that are cast with a fly rod and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy enough to send the fly to the target. The main difference between fly fishing and spin or bait fishing is that in fly fishing the weight of the line carries the hook through the air, whereas in spin and bait fishing the weight of the lure or sinker at the end of the monofilament or braided line gives casting distance. Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a bait fish or crustacean, others &quot;attractors&quot; are known to attract fish although they look like nothing in nature. Flies range in size from a few millimeters to long; most are between . The dry fly is a floating fly which does not pierce the water surface significantly; other kinds of fly, whether floating or sinking, are often referred to as wet flies.

Artificial flies are made by fastening hair, fur, feathers, or other materials, both natural and synthetic, onto a hook. The first flies were tied with natural materials, but synthetic materials are now popular and prevalent. Flies are tied in sizes, colors and patterns to match local terrestrial and aquatic insects, bait-fish, or other prey attractive to the target fish species.

===Fish species===
Fly fishing is most renowned as a method for catching trout, grayling and salmon, but it is also used for a wide variety of species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for &#x27;main target&#x27; species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and the development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.

==History==
Many credit the first recorded use of an artificial fly to the Roman Claudius Aelianus near the end of the 2nd century. He described the practice of Macedonian anglers on the Astraeus River:

In his book &quot;Fishing from the Earliest Times&quot;, however, William Radcliff (1921) gave the credit to Martial (Marcus Valerius Martialis), born some two hundred years before Aelianus, who wrote:

The last word, somewhat indistinct in the original, is either &quot;mosco&quot; (moss) or &quot;musca&quot; (fly) but catching fish with fraudulent moss seems unlikely.

The traditional Japanese method of fly-fishing is known as &quot;Tenkara&quot; (, literally: &quot;from heaven&quot;). Tenkara originated in the mountains of Japan as a way for professional fishermen and inn-keepers to harvest the local fish, Ayu, trout and char for selling and providing a meal to their guests. Primarily a small-stream fishing method that was preferred for being highly efficient, where the long rod allowed the fisherman to place the fly where the fish would be.

Another style of fishing in Japan is Ayu fishing. As written by historian Andrew Herd, in the book &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Fly fishing became popular with Japanese peasants from the twelfth century onward...fishing was promoted to a pastime worthy of Bushi (warriors), as part of an official policy to train the Bushi&#x27;s mind during peacetime.&quot; This refers primarily to Ayu fishing, which commonly uses a fly as lure, uses longer rods, but there is no casting technique required, it&#x27;s more similar to dapping. Ayu was practiced in the lowlands (foothills), where the Bushi resided, tenkara practiced in the mountains. Fishing flies are thought to have originated in Japan for Ayu fishing over 430 years ago. These flies were made with needles that were bent into shape and used as fishing hooks, then dressed as a fly. The rods along with fishing flies, are considered to be a traditional local craft of the Kaga region.

Although anglers in Scotland and Ireland had been fishing the lochs and loughs for trout with an artificial fly for several generations (as far back as 1840 John Colquhoun listed the menus of fly dressings in his book The Moor and Loch detailing the wings, body and hackle of artificial flies in use at the time), the history of stillwater trout fishing in English reservoirs goes back little more than a century. The simple reason for that was because (apart from the Lake District which was somewhat isolated before the construction of the railways) England possessed few large stillwaters that contained trout. That all changed when the water supply reservoirs began to be built to meet the increasing demand for water from the big cities.

The earliest of these reservoirs to be stocked with trout were Thrybergh Reservoir close to Doncaster completed around 1880, Lake Vyrnwy, Powys in 1891, Ravensthorpe Reservoir in Northamptonshire in 1895 and Blagdon Lake in Somerset which was first opened as a trout fishery in 1904.

===Origins===

Other than a few fragmented references little was written on fly fishing until &quot;The Treatyse on Fysshynge with an Angle&quot; was published (1496) within &quot;The Boke of Saint Albans&quot; attributed to Dame Juliana Berners. The book contains instructions on rod, line and hook making and dressings for different flies to use at different times of the year. By the 15th century, rods of approximately fourteen feet length with a twisted line attached at its tips were probably used in England.

The earliest English poetical treatise on Angling by John Dennys, said to have been a fishing companion of Shakespeare, was published in 1613, &quot;The Secrets of Angling&quot;. Footnotes of the work, written by Dennys&#x27; editor, William Lawson, make the first mention of the phrase to &#x27;cast a fly&#x27;: &quot;The trout gives the most gentlemanly and readiest sport of all, if you fish with an artificial fly, a line twice your rod&#x27;s length of three hairs&#x27; thickness... and if you have learnt the cast of the fly.&quot;

The art of fly fishing took a great leap forward after the English Civil War, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. The renowned officer in the Parliamentary army, Robert Venables, published in 1662 &quot;The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river&quot;. Another Civil War veteran to enthusiastically take up fishing was Richard Franck. He was the first to describe salmon fishing in Scotland, and both in that and trout-fishing with artificial fly he was a practical angler. He was the first angler to name the burbot, and commended the salmon of the River Thames.

&quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse; 6 verses were quoted from John Dennys&#x27;s earlier work. A second part to the book was added by Walton&#x27;s friend Charles Cotton.

Walton did not profess to be an expert with a fishing fly; the fly fishing in his first edition was contributed by Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who produced a treatise of his own in 1659; but in the use of the live worm, the grasshopper and the frog &quot;Piscator&quot; himself could speak as a master. The famous passage about the frog, often misquoted as being about the worm—&quot;use him as though you loved him, that is, harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may live the longer&quot;—appears in the original edition. Cotton&#x27;s additions completed the instruction in fly fishing and advised on the making of artificial flies where he listed sixty five varieties.

Charles Kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. He went on to invent the Kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today.

===Development===

The 18th century was mainly an era of consolidation of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialized for different roles. Jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.

The industry also became commercialized - rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, artisans moved to Redditch which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his trading shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a royal warrant and became the official supplier of fishing tackle to three successive monarchs starting with King George IV over this period.

Some have credited Onesimus with the invention of the multiplying winch, although he was certainly the first to advertise its sale. Early multiplying reels were wide and had a small diameter, and their gears, made of brass, often wore down after extensive use. His earliest advertisement in the form of a trading card date from 1768 and was entitled &quot;To all lovers of angling&quot;. A full list of the tackles he sold included artificial flies, and &#x27;the best sort of multiplying brass winches both stop and plain&#x27;. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy.

The impact of the Industrial Revolution was first felt in the manufacture of fly lines. Instead of anglers twisting their own lines - a laborious and time-consuming process - the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed.

British fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques.
Alfred Ronalds took up the sport of fly fishing, learning the craft on the rivers Trent, Blythe and Dove. On the River Blythe, near what is today Creswell Green, Ronalds constructed a bankside fishing hut designed primarily as an observatory of trout behaviour in the river. From this hut, and elsewhere on his home rivers, Ronalds conducted experiments and formulated the ideas that eventually were published in &quot;The Fly-fisher&#x27;s Entomology&quot; in 1836.

He combined his knowledge of fly fishing with his skill as an engraver and printer, to lavish his work with 20 color plates. It was the first comprehensive work related to the entomology associated with fly fishing and most fly-fishing historians credit Ronalds with setting a literature standard in 1836 that is still followed today. Describing methods, techniques and, most importantly, artificial flies, in a meaningful way for the angler and illustrating them in colour is a method of presentation that can be seen in most fly-fishing literature today.

The book was mostly about the aquatic insects—mayflies, caddisflies and stoneflies—that trout and grayling feed on and their counterpart artificial imitations. About half the book is devoted to observations of trout, their behaviour, and the methods and techniques used to catch them. Most of this information, although enhanced by Ronalds&#x27; experiences and observations, was merely an enhancement of Charles Bowlker&#x27;s &quot;Art of Angling&quot; (first published in 1774 but still in print in 1836).

In Chapter IV - &quot;Of a Selection of Insects, and Their Imitations, Used in Fly Fishing&quot; - for the first time is discussed specific artificial fly imitations by name, associated with the corresponding natural insect. Organized by their month of appearance, Ronalds was the first author to begin the standardization of angler names for artificial flies. Prior to &quot;The Fly-fisher&#x27;s Entomology&quot;, anglers had been given suggestions for artificial flies to be used on a particular river or at a particular time of the year, but those suggestions were never matched to specific natural insects the angler might encounter on the water. According to Ernest Schwiebert: &quot;Ronalds is one of the major milestones in the entire literature of fly-fishing, and with his &quot;Entomology&quot; the scientific method has reached angling in full flower. Ronalds was completely original in its content and research, setting the yardstick for all subsequent discussion and illustration of aquatic fly hatches.

===Technological improvements===

Modern reel design had begun in England during the latter part of the 18th century, and the predominant model in use was known as the &#x27;Nottingham reel&#x27;. The reel was a wide drum which spooled out freely, and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift a long way out with the current. Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where similar models were modified by George Snyder of Kentucky into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design, in 1810.

The material used for the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England, to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid-19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. George Cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods and light lines, allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish.
Tackle design began to improve from the 1880s. The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle – this was called a &#x27;tangle&#x27; in Britain, and a &#x27;backlash&#x27; in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.

An American, Charles F. Orvis, designed and distributed a novel reel and fly design in 1874, described by reel historian Jim Brown as the &quot;benchmark of American reel design&quot;, and the first fully modern fly reel. The founding of The Orvis Company helped institutionalize fly fishing by supplying angling equipment via the circulation of his tackle catalogs, distributed to a small but devoted customer list.

Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth, a textiles magnate, patented the modern form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth&#x27;s reel design, the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.

===Expansion===

By the mid to late 19th century, expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or to rivers for fishing. Richer hobbyists ventured further abroad. The large rivers of Norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishermen from England in large numbers in the middle of the century - &quot;Jones&#x27;s guide to Norway, and salmon-fisher&#x27;s pocket companion&quot;, published in 1848, was written by Frederic Tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country.

In southern England, dry-fly fishing acquired an elitist reputation as the only reliable method of fishing the slower, clearer rivers of the south such as the River Test and the other chalk streams concentrated in Hampshire, Surrey, Dorset and Berkshire (see Southern England Chalk Formation for the geological specifics). The weeds found in these rivers tend to grow very close to the surface, and it was necessary to develop new techniques that would keep the fly and the line on the surface of the stream. These methods became the foundation of all later dry-fly developments. F. M. Halford was a major exponent and is generally accepted as &quot;The Father of Modern Dry Fly Fishing.&quot;

However, there was nothing to prevent the successful employment of wet flies on these chalk streams, as G. E. M. Skues proved with his nymph and wet fly techniques. To the horror of dry-fly purists, Skues later wrote two books, &quot;Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream&quot;, and &quot;The Way of a Trout with a Fly&quot;, which greatly influenced the development of wet fly fishing. In northern England and Scotland, many anglers also favored wet-fly fishing, where the technique was more popular and widely practiced than in southern England. One of Scotland&#x27;s leading proponents of the wet fly in the early-to-mid 19th century was W.C. Stewart, who published &quot;The Practical Angler&quot; in 1857.
In the United States, attitudes toward methods of fly fishing were not nearly as rigidly defined, and both dry- and wet-fly fishing were soon adapted to the conditions of the country. Fly anglers there are thought to be the first anglers to have used artificial lures for bass fishing. After pressing into service the fly patterns and tackle designed for trout and salmon to catch largemouth and smallmouth bass, they began to adapt these patterns into specific bass flies. Fly anglers seeking bass developed the spinner/fly lure and bass popper fly, which are still used today.

In the late 19th century, American anglers, such as Theodore Gordon in the Catskill Mountains of New York, began using fly tackle to fish the region&#x27;s brook trout-rich streams such as the Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early American fly anglers also developed new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing in the region and in the United States as a whole. Albert Bigelow Paine, a New England author, wrote about fly fishing in &quot;The Tent Dwellers&quot;, a book about a three-week trip he and a friend took to central Nova Scotia in 1908.

Participation in fly fishing peaked in the early 1920s in the eastern states of Maine and Vermont and in the Midwest in the spring creeks of Wisconsin. Along with deep sea fishing, Ernest Hemingway did much to popularize fly fishing through his works of fiction, including The Sun Also Rises.

Fly fishing in Australia took off when brown trout were first introduced by the efforts of Edward Wilson&#x27;s Acclimatisation Society of Victoria with the aim to &quot;provide for manly sport which will lead Australian youth to seek recreation on the river&#x27;s bank and mountainside rather than in the Cafe and Casino. &quot; The first successful transfer of Brown Trout ova (from the Itchen and Wye) was accomplished by James Arndell Youl, with a consignment aboard &quot;The Norfolk&quot; in 1864. Rainbow Trout were not introduced until 1894. Alfred Ronalds&#x27; daughter Maria Shanklin established Australia&#x27;s first significant fly tying business.

It was the development of inexpensive fiberglass rods, synthetic fly lines, and monofilament leaders, however, in the early 1950s, that revived the popularity of fly fishing. In recent years, interest in fly fishing has surged as baby boomers have discovered the sport. Movies such as Robert Redford&#x27;s film &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, cable fishing shows, and the emergence of a competitive fly casting circuit have added to the sport&#x27;s visibility.

==Methods==
===Casting===
Unlike other casting methods, fly fishing can be thought of as a method of casting the &quot;line&quot; rather than the lure. Non-flyfishing methods rely on the lure&#x27;s own weight to pull line from the reel during the forward motion of a cast. By design, a fly lure is too light and generates too much drag to be cast by its own momentum, and thus simply follows the unfurling of a properly cast fly line, which is heavier at the distal end and therefore more castable than lines used in other types of fishing. Due to the added mass (and thus often bigger diameter) of the fly line, a tapered leader line, sometimes also a secondary leader called a &quot;tippet&quot;, is used to secure the lure to the fly line.

The physics of flycasting can be described by the transfer of impulse, the product of mass and speed through the rod from base to top and from the transfer of impulse through the fly line all the way to the tip of the leader. Because both the rod and the fly line are tapered the smaller amount of mass will reach high speeds as the waves in rod and line unfurl. The waves that travel through the fly line are called &quot;loops&quot;. Determining factors in reaching the highest speeds are the basal frequency of a rod and the transfer of the speed from the tip of the rod to the fly line. At the moment the rod tip reaches its highest velocity the direction of the cast is determined.

The type of cast used when fishing varies according to the conditions. The most common cast is the forward cast, where the angler whisks the fly into the air, back over the shoulder until the line is nearly straight, then forward, using primarily the forearm. The objective of this motion is to &quot;load&quot; (bend) the rod tip with stored energy, then transmit that energy to the line, resulting in the fly line (and the attached fly) being cast for an appreciable distance. However, just bending the rod and releasing it to jerk the fly line forward (like a bowstring or a catapult) will not propel the fly line and fly very far. More important is the movement of the rod through an arc acting as a lever, magnifying the hand movement of the caster (of about a foot) to an arc at the rod tip of several feet. Here the rod acts as a class 3 lever, where the force is applied between the fulcrum and the load. The fulcrum in the fly cast is below the caster&#x27;s hand gripping the rod; the load is at the rod tip; the hand exerts the force between. The caster&#x27;s &quot;stroke&quot; backwards and forwards, for the backcast and the forward cast, operates the rod. Casting without landing the fly on the water is known as &#x27;false casting&#x27;, and may be used to pay out line, to dry a soaked fly, or to reposition a cast. Other casts are the roll cast, the single- or double-haul, the tuck cast, and the side- or curve-cast.

Dropping the fly onto the water and its subsequent movement on or beneath the surface is one of fly fishing&#x27;s most difficult aspects; the angler is attempting to cast in such a way that the line lands smoothly on the water and the fly appears as natural as possible. At a certain point, if a fish does not strike, depending upon the action of the fly in the wind or current, the angler picks up the line to make another presentation. On the other hand, if a fish strikes, the angler pulls in line while raising the rod tip. This &quot;sets&quot; the hook in the fish&#x27;s mouth. The fish is played either by hand, where the angler continues to hold the fly line in one hand to control the tension applied to the fish, or by reeling up any slack in the line and then using the hand to act as a drag on the reel. Most modern fly reels have an adjustable, mechanical drag system to control line tension during a fish&#x27;s run.

Beginners tend to point with the rod to where they want to throw, but the movement of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called &quot;hauling&quot;, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.

There are a great number of special casts meant to evade problems like trees behind the angler (roll cast), the pulling of the line on the fly by the action of the stream, or to make the fly land more softly.

===Spey casting===
Spey casting is a casting technique used in fly fishing. Spey casting requires a longer, heavier two-handed fly rod, referred to as a &quot;Spey rod&quot;. Spey casting is essentially a large roll cast, developed on the Scottish River Spey where high banks do not allow space for the usual back cast.

Spey casting is used for fishing large rivers for salmon and large trout such as steelhead and sea trout. Spey technique is also used in saltwater surf casting. All of these situations require the angler to cast larger flies long distances. The two-handed Spey technique allows more powerful casts and avoids obstacles on the shore by keeping most of the line in front of the angler.

===Fly fishing for trout===
Fly fishing for trout is a very popular sport, which can be done using any of the various methods and any of the general types of flies. Many of the techniques and presentations of fly fishing were first developed in fishing for trout. There is a misconception that all fly fishing for trout is done on the surface of the water with &quot;dry flies.&quot; In most places, especially heavily fished trout areas, success usually comes from fly fishing using flies called &quot;nymphs&quot; that are designed to drift close to the riverbed, also called &quot;nymphing&quot;. A trout feeds below the water&#x27;s surface nearly 90 percent of the time. Trout usually only come to the surface when there is a large bug hatch (when aquatic insects grow wings and leave the water to mate and lay eggs). There are exceptions to this rule, however, particularly during the summer months and on smaller mountain streams, when trout often feed on terrestrial insects such as ants, beetles and grasshoppers.

==Techniques==
===Fishing in cold water===
In order to deceive wary trout, or to reach deep runs where salmon may lie, the fly angler often needs to wade to the right casting position. He therefore requires sure footing and insulation from cold water, both provided by hip boots or chest-high waders.
The latter are of two main types, one-piece &quot;boot foot&quot; waders and &quot;stocking foot&quot; waders, which require external boots.

Formerly of latex rubber, &quot;stocking foot&quot; waders are now made of neoprene, usually 3 mm thick, which provide additional warmth. In the mid-20th century, American anglers developed felt boot soles for a better grip in rocky rivers: but felt is now prohibited in some US states, as a vector of fish and plant diseases that damage sport fisheries. Manufacturers now offer wading boots with special rubber treads or metal studs. Breathable Gore-Tex waders provide ventilation when hiking along the water, but do not provide flotation in the event of slipping or falling into deep water. In deep water streams, an inflatable personal flotation device (PFD), or a Type III Kayak fishing vest, adds a degree of safety.

Some &quot;catch and release&quot; anglers flatten the barb of their hook. Such &quot;barbless hooks&quot; are much easier to remove from the fish (and from the angler, in the event of mishap). Many rivers with special regulations mandate that fishermen use barbless hooks in an effort to conserve a healthy fish population.

===Dry fly trout fishing===

Dry fly fishing is done with line and flies that float, joined by a leader, usually made of fine polyamide monofilament line. The tapered leader is 3 to 5 meters long, thus nearly invisible where the fly is knotted, and the angler can replace the last meter of nylon as required. Unlike sinking fly (nymph) fishing, the &quot;take&quot; on dry flies is visible, explosive and exciting. While trout typically consume about 90% of their diet from below-water sources, the 10% of surface-level consumption by trout is more than enough to keep most anglers busy. Additionally, beginning fly anglers generally prefer dry fly fishing because of the relative ease of detecting a strike and the instant gratification of seeing a trout strike their fly. Nymph fishing may be more productive, but dry fly anglers soon become addicted to the surface strike.
Dry flies may be &quot;attractors&quot;, such as the Royal Wulff, or &quot;natural imitators&quot;, such as the elk hair caddis, a caddisfly imitation A beginner may wish to begin with a fly that is easy to see such as a Royal Wulff attractor or a mayfly imitation such as a parachute adams. The &quot;parachute&quot; on the parachute adams makes the fly land as softly as a natural on the water and has the added benefit of making the fly very visible from the surface. Being able to see the fly is especially helpful to the beginner. The fly should land softly, as if dropped onto the water, with the leader fully extended from the fly line. Due to rivers having faster and slower currents often running side by side, the fly can over take or be overtaken by the line, thus disturbing the fly&#x27;s drift. Mending is a technique whereby one lifts and moves the part of the line that requires re-aligning with the fly&#x27;s drift, thus extending the drag free drift. The mend can be upstream or down stream depending on the currents carrying the line or fly. To be effective, any mending of the fly line should not disturb the natural drift of the fly. Learning to mend is often much easier if the angler can see the fly.

Once a fish has been caught and landed, the fly may no longer float well. A fly can sometimes be dried and made to float again by &quot;false&quot; casting, casting the fly back and forth in the air. In some cases, the fly can be dried with a small piece of reusable absorbent towel, an amadou patch or chamois and after drying placed and shaken in a container full of fly &quot;dressing&quot;; a hydrophobic solution. A popular solution to a dry fly which refuses to float is simply to replace it with another, similar or identical fly until the original can fully dry, rotating through a set of flies.
Dry fly fishing on small, clear-water streams can be especially productive if the angler stays as low to the ground and as far from the bank as possible, moving upstream with stealth. Trout tend to face upstream and most of their food is carried to them on the current. For this reason, the fish&#x27;s attention is normally focused into the current; most anglers move and fish &quot;into the current&quot;, fishing from a position downstream of the fish&#x27;s suspected lie. Trout tend to strike their food at current &quot;edges&quot;, where faster- and slower-moving waters mix. Obstructions to the stream flow, such as large rocks or nearby pools, provide a &quot;low energy&quot; environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy. Casting upstream to the &quot;edge&quot; of the slower water, the angler can see the fly land and drift slowly back downstream. The challenge in stream fishing is placing the fly with deadly accuracy, within inches of a protective rock for instance, not long range casting. Done properly, the fly seems to be just floating along in the current with a &quot;perfect drift&quot; as if not connected to the fly line. The angler must remain vigilant for the &quot;take&quot; in order to be ready to raise the rod tip and set the hook.

===Nymphing for trout===
Trout tend mostly to feed underwater. When fishing deeper waters such as rivers or lakes, putting a fly down to the trout may be more successful than fishing on the surface, especially in the absence of any surface insect activity or hatch. The nymph itself can be weighted, as is the popular bead headed hare&#x27;s ear nymph or bead headed pheasant tail nymph. Alternatively, the angler can use an attractor pattern such as a prince nymph. Weights can be added to the leader. Probably the best weight to use is twist on lead or other metal strips because it has a much less detrimental effect on the casting ability. A sinking tip fly line can also serve to sink the fly. A common nymphing and general overall fly fishing technique that even beginners can master is a &quot;dead drift&quot; or tight line fishing technique, casting directly across the river, letting the fly line drift downriver while keeping any slack out of the line. If the Nymph is drifting too fast, then you should perform an upstream mend. If the nymph is drifting too slowly, you should mend downstream. A beginner need simply to point the rod at the fly, lifting the rod in the event of a strike. This is a &quot;downstream technique&quot; where the angler moves in a downstream direction. More advanced techniques make use of a highly visible strike indicator attached to the leader above the sinking fly.

In New Zealand, nymphing has become the dominant form of fishing in rivers such as the Tongariro River. A technique involving a high visibility indicator, and 2 nymphs tied in short succession (a weighted nymph and a 2nd often un-weighted nymph) means the chances of getting a fly into deeper water with a fly that still moves naturally increases.

It is also possible to use standard sinking fly lines, especially if the current is strong and if it is difficult to get down to the correct level to catch the trout.

===Still water trout fishing===
Fishing for trout in lakes requires different tactics. A canoe, pontoon boat or a float tube allows an angler to cover a lot more water than waders. Trout may congregate in cooler water near an inflowing stream or an underwater spring and may be lured to bite on a streamer fly. An often successful tactic is to pull a streamer such as a woolly bugger using clear sinking line, behind the watercraft. The somewhat erratic motion of the oars or fins tends to give the streamer an enticing action. Trout also tend to &quot;cruise&quot; transitional areas (&quot;e.g.&quot; dropoffs, weed bed edges, subsurface river flow at inlets, etc.) Watching for cruising trout and casting well ahead of any visible fish is often successful.
The legacy of Dr Howard Alexander Bell (1888-1974). Although he never wrote a word about fishing and shunned publicity, Dr Bell of Blagdon had the greatest formative influence of any man on the development of reservoir fishing in the first half of this century. In those days Blagdon was fished with spinners or with traditional sea-trout and low-water salmon flies. Fly fishing was carried out from boats and bank during the evening rise. Daytime fishing with the fly was thought to be of little use. Bell had read Skues and, following his example, used a marrow spoon to spoon out the trout he caught (one of his friends said, ‘He would spoon out his grandmother if he thought there was anything in her’). The stomach contents of the Blagdon trout were a revelation. There was nothing there but small larvae and pupae, among them the pupae of the famous black midge. Dr Bell tied artificials to represent the insects that he found in the Blagdon trout, including bloodworms, midge and sedge pupae and beetles. His flies were quite small, 10s, 12s and sometimes 14s. He might have a Worm Fly on a single hook on the point, a Grenadier (caddis pupa) on the middle dropper and a Buzzer (midge pupa) on the top. All his dressings were plain and simple. Nevertheless, in the 1920s and 30s he set the scene and pointed the way in which imitative patterns of underwater insects were to develop as one of the major techniques of reservoir trout fishing.

===Playing trout===
Once hooked, a small trout can be easily retrieved &quot;on the reel&quot; or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching the line between the rod handle and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the rod tip high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish&#x27;s struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line is already on the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the rod handle, one&#x27;s foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really large trout can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the outgoing line using the fisher&#x27;s fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel&#x27;s drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it will not spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.

===Releasing trout===

Releasing wild trout helps preserve the quality of a fishery. Trout are more delicate than most fish and require careful handling. When a trout has been caught but the hook is still embedded, wet your hands before handling the fish. Dry hands stick to the adhesive slime coating the fish and can pull off its scales. It is preferred for the fish to remain in the water when removing the hook, but holding the trout out of the water will not be lethal, provided the hook is removed quickly and the trout is returned immediately.

Small trout caught on a barb-less hook can be released simply by: grasping the eyelet of the fly, and rotating the eyelet toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the eyelet directly toward the bend until the point is removed from the fish. Large trout can be grasped gently and forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.

Once the hook has been removed, return the trout into the water. Support the trout until it stabilizes. This includes holding the fish in water deep enough to submerge its gills. After long fights, it may be necessary to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding the trout in moving water with its head facing upstream, or, in calm water, moving the trout backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, the trout will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, the trout, not having enough energy to move, will sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate. Take however long is necessary to revive a trout.

===Saltwater fly fishing===

Saltwater fly fishing is typically done with heavier tackle than that which is used for freshwater trout fishing, both to handle the larger, more powerful fish, and to accommodate the casting of larger and heavier flies. Saltwater fly fishing typically employs the use of wet flies resembling baitfish, crabs, shrimp and other forage. However, saltwater fish can also be caught with poppers and other surface lure similar to those used for freshwater bass fishing, though much larger. Saltwater species sought and caught with fly tackle include: bonefish, redfish or red drum, permit, snook, spotted sea trout, tuna, dorado (mahi-mahi), sailfish, tarpon, striped bass, salmon, giant trevally and marlin. Offshore saltwater species are usually attracted to the fly by &quot;chumming&quot; with small baitfish, or &quot;teasing&quot; the fish to the boat by trolling a large hookless lure (Billfish are most often caught using this latter method).

Many saltwater species, particularly large, fast and powerful fish, are not easily slowed down by &quot;palming&quot; the hand on the reel. Instead, a purpose-made saltwater reel for these species must have a powerful drag system. Furthermore, saltwater reels purpose-made for larger fish must be larger, heavier, and corrosion-resistant; a typical high-quality saltwater reel costs US$500.00 or more. Corrosion-resistant equipment is key to durability in all types of saltwater fishing, regardless of the size and power of the target species.
Saltwater fly fishing is most often done from a boat, either a shallow draft flats boat is used to pursue species such as bonefish, redfish, permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger offshore boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other pelagics and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for bonefish or redfish or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch saltwater fish on a fly rod. Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight fly rod and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet if they are going to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for bonefish, redfish, permit, tarpon, jacks and more.

Hooks for saltwater flies must also be extremely durable and corrosion resistant. Most saltwater hooks are made of stainless steel, but the strongest (though less corrosion resistant) hooks are of high-carbon steel. Typically, these hooks vary from size #8 to #2 for bonefish and smaller nearshore species, to size #3/0 to #5/0 for the larger offshore species.

==Tackle==
Fly fishing tackle comprises the fishing tackle or equipment typically used by fly anglers. Fly fishing tackle includes:
* A wide variety of Fly rods of different weights, lengths and material are used to present artificial flies to target species of fish as well as fight and land fish being caught.
* A wide variety of Fly reels are used to store fly line and provide a braking mechanism (drag) for fighting heavy or fast moving fish.
* A wide variety of general use and specialized fly lines are used to cast artificial flies under a wide variety of fresh and saltwater conditions.
* Terminal tackle is used to connect the artificial fly to the fly line and allow the appropriate presentation of the fly to the fish.
* There are a wide variety of accessories—tools, gadgets, clothing and apparel used by the fly angler for maintenance and preparation of tackle, dealing the fish being caught as well as personal comfort and safety while fly fishing. Includes fly boxes used to store and carry artificial flies.

Fly rods are typically between 1.8 m (6 ft) long in freshwater fishing and up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long for two-handed fishing for salmon or steelhead, or in tenkara fishing in small streams. The average rod for fresh and saltwater is around in length and weighs from 3 –5 ounces, though a recent trend has been to lighter, shorter rods for fishing smaller streams. Another trend is to longer rods for small streams. The choice of rod lengths and line weights used varies according to local conditions, types of flies being cast, and/or personal preference.

When actively fishing, the angler may want to keep the fly line lightly pressed against the rod handle with the index finger of the casting arm. The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water. If a fish strikes, the angler can pinch the line with the index finger against the rod handle and lift the rod tip, setting the hook.

==Artificial flies==


In broadest terms, flies are categorised as either imitative or attractive. Imitative flies resemble natural food items. Attractive flies trigger instinctive strikes by employing a range of characteristics that do not necessarily mimic prey items. Flies can be fished floating on the surface (dry flies), partially submerged (emergers), or below the surface (nymphs, streamers, and wet flies). A dry fly is typically thought to represent an insect landing on, falling on (terrestrials), or emerging from, the water&#x27;s surface as might a grasshopper, dragonfly, mayfly, ant, beetle, stonefly or caddisfly. Other surface flies include poppers and hair bugs that might resemble mice, frogs, etc. Sub-surface flies are designed to resemble a wide variety of prey including aquatic insect larvae, nymphs and pupae, baitfish, crayfish, leeches, worms, etc. Wet flies, known as streamers, are generally thought to imitate minnows, leeches or scuds.
Throughout history, artificial flies constructed of furs, feathers, and threads bound on a hook have been created by anglers to imitate fish prey. Most early examples of artificial flies imitated common aquatic insects and baitfish. Today, artificial flies are tied with a wide variety of natural and synthetic materials (like mylar and rubber) to represent all manner of potential freshwater and saltwater fish prey to include aquatic and terrestrial insects, crustaceans, worms, baitfish, vegetation, flesh, spawn, small reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds, etc.

==Knots==
A few knots have become more or less standard for attaching the various parts of the fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing, and several studies have been done evaluating their performance. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler&#x27;s arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in &quot;Gray&#x27;s Loop&quot;). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied to the end of the fly line using a nail or &quot;tube knot&quot; or a &quot;needle knot&quot;. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon&#x27;s knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon&#x27;s knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.

Some traditionalists create their own tapered leaders using progressively smaller-diameter lengths of monofilament line tied together with the blood, &quot;barrel knot&quot; or &quot;surgeons knot&quot;.

A golden bull was a decree issued by Byzantine Emperors. It was later used by monarchs in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, most notably by the Holy Roman Emperors.

For nearly eight hundred years, they were issued unilaterally, without obligations on the part of the other party or parties. However, this eventually proved disadvantageous as the Byzantines sought to restrain the efforts of foreign powers to undermine the empire. During the 12th century, the Byzantines began to insert into golden bulls sworn statements of the obligations of their negotiating partners.

==Etymology==
The term was originally coined for the golden seal (a &quot;bulla aurea&quot;), attached to the decree, but came to be applied to the entire decree. Such decrees were known as golden bulls in western Europe and &quot;chrysobullos logos&quot;, or chrysobulls, in the Byzantine Empire (χρυσός, &quot;chrysos&quot;, being Greek for gold).

===Notable golden bulls===
Notable golden bulls include:
* The Golden Bull of 1082, issued by Alexios I Komnenos to grant Venice merchants with free trading rights, exempt from tax, throughout the Byzantine Empire in return for their defense of the Adriatic Sea against the Normans.

<text>Benjamin Grubb Humphreys (August 26, 1808December 20, 1882) was an American politician from Mississippi. He was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and served as Governor of Mississippi from 1865 to 1868, during Reconstruction.

==Early life==
Humphreys was born in Claiborne County in the Territory of Mississippi, on the Bayou Pierre. He was educated in New Jersey and enrolled at United States Military Academy in the same class as Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston. However, he was expelled in 1826 when he participated in a &quot;Christmas frolic&quot; that ended up turning into the Eggnog Riot.

Upon his return to Mississippi, he was elected to the state senate representing his native county, serving from 1839 to 1844. In 1846, he moved to Sunflower County, Mississippi, and founded Itta Bena. He developed a cotton plantation there.

==Civil War==
During the American Civil War, Humphreys raised a company and was commissioned a captain in the Confederate States Army in 1861. Part of the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment, he was elected to the rank of colonel the same year and brigaded with other regiments under the command of Brig. Gen. William Barksdale in the Eastern Theater. At the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, Humphreys&#x27;s regiment was part of the force that attacked U.S. Army positions at the Peach Orchard, driving the U.S. soldiers back toward Cemetery Ridge. Humphreys took command of the brigade after the death of Barksdale. He was subsequently promoted to brigadier general, and remained in command until he was wounded in the battle of Berryville, Virginia, on September 3, 1864. Humphreys returned home to Mississippi to heal but could not return to active duty before the war ended.

==Political career==
Confederate surrender in 1865 was followed by Reconstruction of state governments. Secessionist officials and military officers were forbidden to hold public office in the United States unless pardoned. Benjamin Humphreys was unpardoned when he announced his candidacy for Mississippi governor as a Democrat. President Andrew Johnson did not want him elected and refused to pardon him. Humphreys persisted in his candidacy, won the election on October 2, 1865, and was inaugurated and sworn in as Governor on October 16. On October 26, provisional Governor William L. Sharkey received from President Johnson a pardon for Humphreys. Humphreys won re-election to a second term in 1868.

However, Republicans in Congress took control of Reconstruction, and on June 15, he was physically removed from office by soldiers of the U.S. Army.

As a Democratic Governor of the State of Mississippi, he professed the ideology of White supremacy. In his own words:
After he retired from politics, Humphreys entered a career in insurance in Jackson, Mississippi. He continued there until his retirement in 1877, when he moved to his plantation in Leflore County, Mississippi, where he died in 1882. He is buried in Wintergreen Cemetery, Port Gibson, Mississippi.

Humphreys County, Mississippi, is named after him. His son, Benjamin G. Humphreys II, was a United States Representative from Mississippi.

<doc id="218767" wikidata="Q1351681" url="?curid=218767" title="Thyroidectomy">
<text>A thyroidectomy is an operation that involves the surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. In general surgery, endocrine or head and neck surgeons often perform a thyroidectomy when a patient has thyroid cancer or some other condition of the thyroid gland (such as hyperthyroidism) or goiter. Other indications for surgery include cosmetic (very enlarged thyroid), or symptomatic obstruction (causing difficulties in swallowing or breathing). Thyroidectomy is a common surgical procedure that has several potential complications or sequelae including: temporary or permanent change in voice, temporary or permanently low calcium, need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement, bleeding, infection, and the remote possibility of airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Complications are uncommon when the procedure is performed by an experienced surgeon.

The thyroid produces several hormones, such as thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin. After the removal of a thyroid, patients usually take a prescribed oral synthetic thyroid hormone—levothyroxine (Synthroid)—to prevent hypothyroidism. Less extreme variants of thyroidectomy include:

* hemithyroidectomy (or unilateral lobectomy): removing only half of the thyroid

* isthmectomy or isthmusectomy: removing the band of tissue (or isthmus) connecting the two lobes of the thyroid

A thyroidectomy should not be confused with a thyroidotomy (thyrotomy), which is a cutting into (&quot;‑otomy&quot;) the thyroid, not a removal (&quot;‑ectomy&quot;, literally “out-cutting”) of it. A thyroidotomy can be performed to get access for a median laryngotomy, or to perform a biopsy. (Although technically a biopsy involves removing some tissue, it is more frequently categorized as an &quot;‑otomy&quot; than an &quot;‑ectomy&quot; because the volume of tissue removed is minuscule.)

Traditionally, the thyroid has been removed through a neck incision that leaves a permanent scar. More recently, minimally invasive and &quot;scarless&quot; approaches such as transoral thyroidectomy have become popular in some parts of the world. In the United States it is a common procedure, performed over 100,000 times per year. 

== Uses ==
Thyroidectomy is used in the treatment of:
* Thyroid cancer
* Toxic thyroid nodule (produces too much thyroid hormone)
* Multinodular goiter (enlarged thyroid gland with many nodules), especially if there is compression of nearby structures
* Graves&#x27; disease, especially if there is exophthalmos (bulging eyes)
* Thyroid nodule, if fine needle aspirate (FNA) results are unclear

== Types ==

:::::::::::::* &quot;Hemithyroidectomy&quot; — Entire isthmus is removed along with 1 lobe. Done in benign diseases of only 1 lobe.
:::::::::::::* &quot;Subtotal thyroidectomy&quot; — Removal of majority of both lobes leaving behind 4-5 grams (equivalent to the size of a normal thyroid gland) of thyroid tissue on one or both sides—this used to be the most common operation for multinodular goitre.
:::::::::::::* &quot;Partial thyroidectomy&quot; —Removal of gland in front of trachea after mobilization. Done in nontoxic MNG. Its role is controversial.
:::::::::::::* &quot;Near total thyroidectomy&quot; — Both lobes are removed except for a small amount of thyroid tissue (on one or both sides) in the vicinity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve entry point and the superior parathyroid gland.
:::::::::::::* &quot;Total thyroidectomy&quot; — Entire gland is removed. Done in cases of papillary or follicular carcinoma of thyroid, medullary carcinoma of thyroid. This is now also the most common operation for multinodular goitre.
:::::::::::::* &quot;Hartley Dunhill operation&quot; — Removal of 1 entire lateral lobe with isthmus and partial/subtotal removal of opposite lateral lobe. Done in nontoxic MNG.

== Complications ==
* Hypothyroidism in up to 50% of patients after ten years.
* Laryngeal nerve injury in about 1% of patients, in particular the recurrent laryngeal nerve: Unilateral damage results in a hoarse voice. Bilateral damage presents as laryngeal obstruction after surgery and can be a surgical emergency: an emergency tracheostomy may be needed. Recurrent Laryngeal nerve injury may occur during the ligature of the inferior thyroid artery.
* Hypoparathyroidism temporary (transient) in many patients, but permanent in about 1 to 4% of patients
* Anesthetic complications
* Infection (at about a 2% rate. Drainage is an important part of treatment.), possibly an increased risk with chronic pre-operative steroid use.
* Stitch granuloma
* Chyle leak
* Haemorrhage/Hematoma (This may compress the airway, becoming life-threatening.)
* Removal or devascularization of the parathyroids

== History ==
Al-Zahrawi, a tenth century Arab physician, sometimes referred to as the &quot;father of surgery&quot;, is credited with the performance of the first thyroidectomy.

<doc id="218768" wikidata="Q507517" url="?curid=218768" title="Rochester, Kent">
<text>Rochester ( ) is a town in the unitary authority of Medway, in Kent, England. It is at the lowest bridging point of the River Medway, about east-southeast of London. The town forms a conurbation with neighbouring towns Chatham, Rainham, Strood and Gillingham. Rochester was a city until losing its status as one in 1998 following the forming of Medway and failing to protect its status as a city, the first city to do so in the history of the United Kingdom. There have been ongoing campaigns to reinstate the city status for Rochester. In 2011 it had a population of 62,982.

Rochester was for many years a favourite of Charles Dickens, who owned nearby Gads Hill Place, Higham, basing many of his novels on the area. The Diocese of Rochester, the second-oldest in England, is centred on Rochester Cathedral and was responsible for founding a school, now &quot;The King&#x27;s School&quot;, in 604 AD, which is recognised as the second-oldest continuously running school in the world. Rochester Castle, built by Bishop Gundulf of Rochester, has one of the best-preserved keeps in either England or France. During the First Barons&#x27; War (1215–1217) in King John&#x27;s reign, baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop Stephen Langton and held it against the king, who then besieged it.

As well as the historic centre, the suburbs of Borstal and The Delce are also part of Rochester, forming part of the Medway Towns urban area with a population of about 250,000.

==Toponymy==
The Romano-British name for Rochester was Durobrivae, later Durobrivis 730 and Dorobrevis in 844. The two commonly cited origins of this name are that it either came from &quot;stronghold by the bridge(s)&quot; or is the latinisation of the British word &quot;Dourbruf&quot; meaning &quot;swiftstream&quot;. Durobrivis was pronounced &#x27;Robrivis. Later, the word &quot;cæster&quot; (=castle, from Latin &quot;castrum&quot;) was added to the name, and the city was called &quot;Robrivis Cæster&quot;. Bede mentions the city in c. 730 and calls it &quot;Hrofes cæster&quot;, mistaking its meaning as Hrofi&#x27;s fortified camp. From this came c. 730 Hrofæscæstre, 811 Hrofescester, 1086 Rovescester, 1610 Rochester. The Latinised adjective &#x27;Roffensis&#x27; refers to Rochester.

==History==

Neolithic remains have been found in the vicinity of Rochester; over time, it has been variously occupied by Celts, Romans, Jutes and/or Saxons. During the Celtic period, it was one of the two administrative centres of the Cantiaci tribe. During the Roman conquest of Britain, a decisive battle was fought at the Medway somewhere near Rochester. The first bridge was subsequently constructed early in the Roman period. During the later Roman period, the settlement was walled in stone. King Æthelberht of Kent (560–616) established a legal system which has been preserved in the 12th-century &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;. In AD 604, the bishopric and cathedral were founded. During this period, from the recall of the legions until the Norman conquest, Rochester was sacked at least twice and besieged on another occasion.

The medieval period saw the building of the current cathedral (1080–1130, 1227 and 1343), the building of two castles and the establishment of a significant town. Rochester Castle saw action in the sieges of 1215 and 1264. Rochester&#x27;s basic street plan was set out, constrained by the river, Watling Street, Rochester Priory and Rochester Castle.

Rochester has produced two martyrs: St John Fisher, executed by Henry VIII for refusing to sanction the divorce of Catherine of Aragon; and Bishop Nicholas Ridley, executed by Queen Mary for being an English Reformation protestant.

===Military history===
Rochester has for centuries been of great strategic importance through its position near the confluence of the Thames and the Medway. Rochester Castle was built to guard the river crossing. In 1667, the city was raided by the Dutch fleet as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The Dutch, commanded by Admiral de Ruijter, broke through the chain at Upnor and sailed to Rochester Bridge capturing part of the English fleet and burning it.

The Royal Navy Dockyard&#x27;s establishment at Chatham witnessed the beginning of the Royal Navy&#x27;s long period of supremacy. The town, as part of Medway, is surrounded by two circles of fortresses; the inner line built during the Napoleonic wars consists of Fort Clarence, Fort Pitt, Fort Amherst and Fort Gillingham. The outer line of Palmerston Forts was built during the 1860s in light of the report by the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom and consists of Fort Borstal, Fort Bridgewood, Fort Luton, and the Twydall Redoubts, with two additional forts on islands in the Medway, namely Fort Hoo and Fort Darnet.

During the First World War the Short Brothers&#x27; aircraft manufacturing company developed the first plane to launch a torpedo, the Short Admiralty Type 184, at its seaplane factory on the River Medway not far from Rochester Castle. In the intervening period between the 20th century World Wars the company established a world-wide reputation as a constructor of flying boats with aircraft such as the Singapore, Empire &#x27;C&#x27;-Class and Sunderland. During the Second World War, Shorts also designed and manufactured the first four-engined bomber, the Stirling.

The UK&#x27;s decline in naval power and shipbuilding competitiveness led to the government decommissioning the RN Shipyard at Chatham in 1984, which led to the subsequent demise of much local maritime industry. Rochester and its neighbouring communities were hit hard by this and have experienced a painful adjustment to a post-industrial economy, with much social deprivation and unemployment resulting. On the closure of Chatham Dockyard the area experienced an unprecedented surge in unemployment to 24%; this had dropped to 2.4% of the local population by 2014.

===Civic history and traditions===
Rochester was recognised as a City from 1211 to 1998. The City of Rochester&#x27;s ancient status was unique, as it had no formal council or Charter Trustees nor a Mayor, instead having the office of Admiral of the River Medway, whose incumbent acted as &quot;de facto&quot; civic leader.

Since Norman times Rochester had always governed land on the other side of the Medway in Strood, which was known as &quot;Strood Intra&quot;; before 1835 it was about wide and stretched to Gun Lane. In the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 the boundaries were extended to include more of Strood and Frindsbury, and part of Chatham known as &quot;Chatham Intra&quot;.

Like many of the medieval towns of England, Rochester had civic Freemen whose historic duties and rights were abolished by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. However, the &quot;Guild of Free Fishers and Dredgers&quot; continues to the present day and retains rights, duties and responsibilities on the Medway, between Sheerness and Hawkwood Stone. This ancient corporate body convenes at the Admiralty Court whose Jury of Freemen is responsible for the conservancy of the River as enshrined in current legislation. The City Freedom can be obtained by residents after serving a period of &quot;servitude&quot;, i.e. apprenticeship (traditionally seven years), before admission as a Freeman. The annual ceremonial Beating of the Bounds by the River Medway takes place after the Admiralty Court, usually on the first Saturday of July.

===Ecclesiastical parishes===

There were three medieval parishes: St Nicholas&#x27;, St Margaret&#x27;s and St Clement&#x27;s. St Clement&#x27;s was in Horsewash Lane until the last vicar died in 1538 when it was joined with St Nicholas&#x27; parish; the church&#x27;s last remaining foundations were finally removed when the railway was being constructed in the 1850s. St Nicholas&#x27; Church was built in 1421 beside the cathedral to serve as a parish church for the citizens of Rochester. The ancient cathedral included the Benedictine monastic priory of St Andrew with greater status than the local parishes. Rochester&#x27;s pre-1537 diocese, under the jurisdiction of the Church of Rome, covered a vast area extending into East Anglia and included all of Essex.

As a result of the restructuring of the Church during the Reformation the cathedral was reconsecrated as the &quot;Cathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; without parochial responsibilities, being a diocesan church. In the 19th century the parish of St Peter&#x27;s was created to serve the burgeoning city with the new church being consecrated in 1859. Following demographic shifts, St Peter&#x27;s and St Margaret&#x27;s were recombined as a joint benefice in 1953 with the parish of St Nicholas with St Clement being absorbed in 1971. The combined parish is now the &quot;Parish of St Peter with St Margaret&quot;, centred at the new (1973) Parish Centre in The Delce (St Peter&#x27;s) with St Margaret&#x27;s remaining as a chapel-of-ease. Old St Peter&#x27;s was demolished in 1974, while St Nicholas&#x27; Church has been converted into the diocesan offices but remains consecrated. Continued expansion south has led to the creation of an additional more recent parish of St Justus (1956) covering The Tideway estate and surrounding area.

A church dedicated to St Mary the Virgin at Eastgate, which was of Anglo-Saxon foundation, is understood to have constituted a parish until the Middle Ages, but few records survive.

==Governance==
On 1 April 1974, the City Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and the territory was merged with the District of Medway, Borough of Chatham and most of Strood Rural District, including the parishes of Cuxton, Halling and Cliffe, and the Hoo Peninsula, to form a new a local government district called the Borough of Medway, within the county of Kent. Medway Borough Council applied to inherit Rochester&#x27;s city status, but this was refused; instead letters patent were granted constituting the area of the former Rochester local government district to be the City of Rochester, to &quot;perpetuate the ancient name&quot; and to recall &quot;the long history and proud heritage of the said City&quot;. The Home Office said that the city status may be extended to the entire borough if it had &quot;Rochester&quot; in its name, so in 1979, Medway Borough Council renamed the borough to the Borough of Rochester-upon-Medway, and in 1982, Rochester&#x27;s city status was transferred to the entire borough by letters patent, with the district being called the City of Rochester-upon-Medway. The Admiral of the River Medway was &quot;ex-officio&quot; Mayor of Rochester and this dignity transferred to the Mayor of Medway when that unitary authority was created, along with the Admiralty Court for the River which constitutes a committee of the council.
On 1 April 1998, the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham were abolished and became the new unitary authority of Medway. The Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions informed the city council that since it was the local government district that officially held City status under the 1982 Letters Patent, the council would need to appoint charter trustees to preserve its city status. However, no trustees were appointed and the city status was therefore lost when Rochester-upon-Medway was abolished as a local government district. The incoming Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, it was advised that Rochester was not on the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office&#x27;s list of cities.

In 2010, Medway Council started to refer to the &quot;City of Medway&quot; in promotional material, but it was rebuked and instructed not to do so in future by the Advertising Standards Authority. Subsequently, Medway Council has applied for City status for Medway as a whole, rather than merely for Rochester. Medway applied unsuccessfully for City status in 2000 and 2002 and again in the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Year of 2012. Any future bid to regain formal City status has been recommended to be made under the aegis of Rochester-upon-Medway.

The 2011 definition of Rochester includes Strood to the northwest and is defined as an urban subdivision with a 2011 population of 62,982. Strood makes up the majority of Rochester&#x27;s population on the west bank of the river, making the town of Rochester itself on the east bank actually smaller and less populated than its neighbouring town; should the two towns ever separate Strood would be the larger of the two.

Lauren Edwards MP is the current Labour parliamentary representative for the constituency.

==Geography==

Rochester lies within the area, known to geologists, as the London Basin. The low-lying Hoo peninsula to the north of the town consists of London Clay, and the alluvium brought down by the two rivers—the Thames and the Medway—whose confluence is in this area. The land rises from the river, and being on the dip slope of the North Downs, this consists of chalk surmounted by the Blackheath Beds of sand and gravel.

As a human settlement, Rochester became established as the lowest river crossing of the River Medway, well before the arrival of the Romans.

It is a focal point between two routes, being part of the main route connecting London with the Continent and the north–south routes following the course of the Medway connecting Maidstone and the Weald of Kent with the Thames and the North Sea. The Thames Marshes were an important source of salt. Rochester&#x27;s roads follow north Kent&#x27;s valleys and ridges of steep-sided chalk bournes. There are four ways out of town to the south: up Star Hill, via The Delce, along the Maidstone Road or through Borstal. The town is inextricably linked with the neighbouring Medway Towns but separated from Maidstone by a protective ridge known as the Downs, a designated area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

At its most limited geographical size, Rochester is defined as the market town within the city walls, now associated with the historic medieval city. However, Rochester historically also included the ancient wards of Strood Intra on the river&#x27;s west bank, and Chatham Intra as well as the three old parishes on the Medway&#x27;s east bank.

The diocese of Rochester is another geographical entity which can be referred to as Rochester.
==Climate==
Rochester has an oceanic climate similar to much of southern England, being accorded Köppen Climate Classification-subtype of &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate).

On 10 August 2003, neighbouring Gravesend recorded one of the highest temperatures since meteorological records began in the United Kingdom, with a reading of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit), only beaten by Brogdale, near Faversham, to the ESE. The weather station at Brogdale is run by a volunteer, only reporting its data once a month, whereas Gravesend, which has an official Met Office site at the PLA pilot station, reports data hourly.

Being near the mouth of the Thames Estuary with the North Sea, Rochester is relatively close to continental Europe and enjoys a somewhat less temperate climate than other parts of Kent and most of East Anglia. It is therefore less cloudy, drier and less prone to Atlantic depressions with their associated wind and rain than western regions of Britain, as well as being hotter in summer and colder in winter. Rochester city centre&#x27;s micro-climate is more accurately reflected by these officially recorded figures than by readings taken at Rochester Airport.

North and North West Kent continue to record higher temperatures in summer, sometimes being the hottest area of the country, &quot;eg.&quot; on the warmest day of 2011, when temperatures reached 33.1 degrees. Additionally, it holds at least two records for the year 2010, of 30.9 °C and 31.7 °C. Another record was set during England&#x27;s Indian summer of 2011 with 29.9 °C, the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK for October.

==Buildings==

Rochester comprises numerous important historic buildings, the most prominent of which are the Guildhall, the Corn Exchange, Restoration House, Eastgate House, as well as Rochester Castle and Rochester Cathedral. Many of the town centre&#x27;s old buildings date from as early as the 14th century up to the 18th century. The chapel of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital dates from the ancient priory hospital&#x27;s foundation in 1078.

In the 21st century the Riverside area north of the railway line has been redeveloped to provide new housing and a primary school.

==Economy==
Thomas Aveling started a small business in 1850 producing and repairing agricultural plant equipment. In 1861 this became the firm of Aveling and Porter, which was to become the largest manufacturer of agricultural machinery and steam rollers in the country. Aveling was elected Admiral of the River Medway (i.e. Mayor of Rochester) for 1869–70.

Tourism is now a sector.

==Culture==

===Sweeps Festival===
Since 1980 the city has seen the revival of the historic Rochester Jack-in-the-Green May Day dancing chimney sweeps tradition, which had died out in the early 1900s. Though not unique to Rochester (similar sweeps&#x27; gatherings were held across southern England, including in Bristol, Deptford, Whitstable and Hastings), its revival was directly inspired by Dickens&#x27; description of the celebration in &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;.

The festival has since grown from a small gathering of local Morris dance sides to one of the largest in the world. The festival begins with the &quot;Awakening of Jack-in-the-Green&quot; ceremony, and continues in Rochester High Street over the May Bank Holiday weekend.

There are numerous other festivals in Rochester apart from the Sweeps Festival. The association with Dickens is the theme for Rochester&#x27;s two Dickens Festivals held annually in June and December. The Medway Fuse Festival usually arranges performances in Rochester and the latest festival to take shape is the Rochester Literature Festival, the brainchild of three local writers.

===Library===
A new public library was built alongside the Adult Education Centre, Eastgate. This enabled the registry office to move from Maidstone Road, Chatham into the Corn Exchange on Rochester High Street (where the library was formerly housed). As mentioned in a report presented to Medway Council&#x27;s &quot;Community Services Overview and Scrutiny Committee&quot; on 28 March 2006, the new library opened in late summer (2006).

===Huguenot Museum===
A new Huguenot Museum, which includes items from the collections of the French Hospital, was opened in Rochester on 13 May 2015, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and individual donations.

===Theatre===

There is a small amateur theatre, Medway Little Theatre, on St Margaret&#x27;s Banks, Rochester High Street (the part of the High Street that continues from Star Hill towards Chatham) and just opposite the former railway station. Converted from a building which in its almost 200-year history had been, amongst other things, a wine merchants, warehouse and printing works the theatre&#x27;s first season was in 1958. Since then hundreds of plays have been presented ranging from Shakespeare to Ayckbourn, modern classics to timeless farces along with many plays presented for the first time in the Medway Towns and, indeed, Kent. Medway Little Theatre also has a thriving youth company and a children&#x27;s workshop for younger people. Every summer the Duncan Rand One-Act Play Festival (named after one of Medway Little Theatre&#x27;s founders) attracts groups from far and wide.

===Media===
Local newspapers for Rochester include the &quot;Medway Messenger&quot;, published by the KM Group, and free papers.

The local commercial radio station for Rochester is KMFM Medway, owned by the KM Group. Medway is also served by community radio station Radio Sunlight which is now an online service. The area also receives broadcasts from county-wide stations BBC Radio Kent, Heart, Gold and Smooth, as well as from various Essex and Greater London radio stations.
Rochester is part of the ITV Meridian and BBC South East area, receiving television signals from the Bluebell Hill transmitter on the crest of the North Downs to the SE, supplemented by a low power relay transmitter in central Chatham.

===Sport===
Football is played with many teams competing in Saturday and Sunday leagues. The local football club is Rochester United F.C. Rochester F.C. was its old football club but has been defunct for many decades. Rugby is also played; Medway RFC play their matches at Priestfields and &quot;Old Williamsonians&quot; is associated with Sir Joseph Williamson&#x27;s Mathematical School.

Cricket is played in the town, with teams entered in the Kent Cricket League.
Holcombe Hockey Club enter teams in both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s England Hockey Leagues. Speedway was staged on a track adjacent to City Way that opened in 1932. Proposals for a revival in the early 1970s did not materialise and the &quot;Rochester Bombers&quot; became the Romford Bombers.

Sailing and rowing are also popular on the River Medway with respective clubs being based in Rochester.

===Film===
The 1959 James Bond novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot; describes Bond driving along the A2 through the Medway Towns from Strood to Chatham. Of interest is the mention of &quot;inevitable traffic jams&quot; on the Strood side of Rochester Bridge, the novel being written some years prior to the construction of the M2 motorway Medway bypass.

Rochester is the setting of the controversial 1965 Peter Watkins television film &quot;The War Game&quot;, which depicts the town&#x27;s destruction by a nuclear missile. The opening sequence was shot in Chatham Town Hall, but the credits particularly thank the people of Dover, Gravesend and Tonbridge.

A scene in the 2001 film &quot;Last Orders&quot;, starring Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay, was filmed in Rochester High Street.

The 2011 adventure film &quot;Ironclad&quot; is based upon the 1215 siege of Rochester Castle. There are however areas where the plot differs from accepted historical narrative.

===Notable people===

The historic city was for many years the favourite of Charles Dickens, who lived within the diocese at nearby Gads Hill Place, Higham, many of his novels being based on the area. Descriptions of the town appear in &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and (lightly fictionalised as &quot;Cloisterham&quot;) in &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. Elements of two houses in Rochester, Satis House and Restoration House, are used for Miss Havisham&#x27;s house in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Satis House.

A monk of Rochester, Edmund of Hadenham (fl. 1307) was an English chronicler.

The priest, botanist and geologist John Stevens Henslow (1796–1861) was born in Rochester.

The actress Dame Sybil Thorndike and her brother Russell were brought up in Minor Canon Row adjacent to the cathedral; the daughter of a canon of Rochester Cathedral, she was educated at Rochester Grammar School for Girls. A local doctors&#x27; practice, local dental practice and a hall at Rochester Grammar School are all named after her.

Sir Peter Buck was Admiral of the Medway in the 17th century; knighted in 1603 he and Bishop Barlow hosted King James, the Stuart royal family and the King of Denmark in 1606. A civil servant to The Royal Dockyard and Lord High Admiral, Buck lived at Eastgate House, Rochester.

Major-General Denis Redman, a World War II veteran, was born and raised in Rochester and later became a founder member of REME, head of his Corps and a Major-General in the British Army.

The model and actress Kelly Brook went to Delce Junior School in Rochester and later the Thomas Aveling School (formerly Warren Wood Girls School).

==Education==
Medway council run a selective system of education, similar to other local authorities in Kent, but call their secondary modern schools &quot;secondary schools&quot;. Almost all secondary schools in Rochester have opted for academy status.

In 1701, Sir Joseph Williamson left a bequest to establish the Mathematical School, a boys&#x27; grammar school, also referred to either as &quot;Rochester Math&quot; or &quot;The Math School&quot;. Unlike earlier educational foundations, such as The King&#x27;s School, it was not tied to a religious establishment, but was opened for practical instruction of boys in navigation and mathematics.

The University for the Creative Arts, formerly the Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design, was located on the boundary of Rochester with Chatham.

==Transport==

;Road
Rochester is on the A2, which crosses the Medway at Rochester Bridge – the route roughly follows the ancient road known as Watling Street, first paved by the Romans, but used by earlier Britons for centuries before the Roman invasion. Nowadays vehicular traffic is largely diverted onto the nearby M2 motorway.
Watling Street passes through the town, and slightly to the south both the M2 motorway and the High Speed 1 railway line bridge the River Medway.
;Bus
Bus services are operated by Arriva Southern Counties, which took over the locally owned Maidstone &amp; District bus company in the 1990s. Other local bus companies including Nu-Venture provide certain services, some contracted from the local council.
;Rail

Rochester railway station is on the Chatham Main Line and the North Kent Line. High speed services to St Pancras in London run via the North Kent Line with a junction east of Ebbsfleet International giving a journey time of slightly under 40 minutes. All railway services are provided by Southeastern.
;Air
Rochester Airport began in September 1933 when Rochester City Council purchased some land as the site for a municipal airport. One month later the aircraft manufacturers Short Brothers leased the land for test flying. By 1934–5 Short Brothers had taken over the site, and moved in some of their personnel from the existing seaplane works. The inaugural flight into Rochester was from Gravesend, John Parker flying the Short Brothers Short Scion G-ACJI.

In 1979 the lease reverted to the City Council. After giving thorough consideration to closing the airport, GEC (then comprising Marconi and instrument makers Elliot Automation) decided to take over management of the airport. It maintained two grass landing strips while releasing some land for light industrial expansion.
