<text>Final Destination is a 2000 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wong, with a screenplay written by Wong, Glen Morgan, and Jeffrey Reddick, based on a story by Reddick. It is the first installment in the &quot;Final Destination&quot; film series and stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Tony Todd. Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a of a catastrophic plane explosion. He and several of his classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.

The film began as a spec script written by Reddick for an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in order for Reddick to get a TV agent. A colleague at New Line Cinema persuaded Reddick to write it as a feature-length film. Later, Wong and Morgan, &quot;The X-Files&quot; writing partners, became interested in the script and agreed to rewrite and direct the film, marking Wong&#x27;s film directing debut. Filming took place in New York City and Vancouver, with additional scenes filmed in Toronto and San Francisco. It was released on March 17, 2000, and became a financial success, making $10 million on its opening weekend.

The film received generally negative reviews from critics but received the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Sawa&#x27;s performance. The film&#x27;s success spawned a media franchise, encompassing five additional installments, as well as a series of novels and comic books. The first sequel, &quot;Final Destination 2&quot;, was released on January 31, 2003.

==Plot==

High school student Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180, a Boeing 747, with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris from John F. Kennedy Airport. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition that the plane will face a mechanical failure, leading to a mid-air explosion, killing everybody on board. When the events from his vision begin to occur in reality, he panics until a fight breaks out between him and his rival Carter Horton, resulting in both of them being removed from the plane, along with Alex&#x27;s best friend Tod Waggner, Carter&#x27;s girlfriend Terry Chaney, teacher Valerie Lewton, and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the other passengers, except Clear, believes Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off. Afterward, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, Weine and Schreck, who are both suspicious of Alex.

Thirty-nine days later, after attending a memorial service for the victims, an unusual chain reaction causes Tod to be accidentally hanged in his shower that night. While his death is ruled a suicide, Alex sneaks into the funeral home along with Clear to examine Tod&#x27;s corpse. The home&#x27;s mortician, William Bludworth, reveals that the survivors who escaped from the impending circumstance have disrupted Death&#x27;s plan, who is now claiming the lives of those who were meant to die from the accident. Alex and Clear are discussing their next move when the rest of the survivors arrive outside the café, where Terry is run over and killed by a speeding bus.

After watching a news report on the cause of the explosion, Alex concludes that Death is reclaiming the survivors according to the sequence of their intended demise on the plane. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after a falling kitchen knife impales her. The remaining survivors reunite while driving through town as Alex explains the situation. Carter, who is next, is enraged over Terry&#x27;s loss and drives erratically through the streets before stopping his car in front of an oncoming train, attempting to die on his own terms. While the others escape, he changes his mind at the last minute, but his seatbelt jams. Alex manages to save him just before the car is smashed by the train, but the shrapnel from the wreckage decapitates Billy. Alex deduces that because he intervened in Carter&#x27;s death, it skipped to the next person in the sequence. Alex, believing himself to be next, spends the next day hiding out in a fortified cabin, but soon recalls having changed seats with two classmates in his premonition and realizes that Clear is actually next. He rushes to her house to save her while being pursued by Weine and Schreck, who believe Alex is responsible for the remaining survivors&#x27; deaths. Alex finds Clear trapped inside her car and surrounded by loose electrical cables that ignite a gasoline leak around her. He grabs a cable, allowing her to escape from the car just before it explodes.

Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to Paris six months later to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex reveals that Death never skipped him after he saved Clear. Fearing their struggle is unfinished, Alex retreats when a bus hurls a parking sign toward a neon sign which descends toward him. Carter pushes Alex out of the way at the last second, but the sign swings back down toward Carter and kills him.

==Production==
===Development===
The original idea was written by Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for &quot;The X-Files&quot; in order to get a TV agent. &quot;I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.&#x27; She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed,&quot; said Reddick. &quot;I thought, that&#x27;s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?&quot; Building on his idea, Reddick wrote a script and got an agent, but instead of submitting the script to &quot;The X-Files&quot;, he acted on the suggestion of a colleague at New Line Cinema to write it as a feature film.

New Line Cinema bought Reddick&#x27;s treatment and hired him to write the original draft of the script, which featured Death as an unseen force. The survivors were originally adults, but New Line made Reddick change them to teenagers after the success of &quot;Scream&quot;. After the script was finished, New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors, including writing partners James Wong and Glen Morgan. Both writers were willing to make it into a film, although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. &quot;I believe that at one time or another we&#x27;ve all experienced a sense of prescience. We have a hunch, a feeling, and then that hunch proves true,&quot; Wong said. &quot;We want to do for planes and air travel what &quot;Jaws&quot; did for sharks and swimming&quot;. Expanding on his decision to write and direct the film, Wong stated:
One thing we were all in agreement on from the start is that we didn&#x27;t want to do a slasher movie. [. . .] I became very excited when we decided to make the world at large, in the service of death, our antagonist. Everyday objects and occurrences then take on ominous proportions and it becomes less about whether or not our characters are going to die and more about how they will die and how they can delay their deaths. The entertainment value is in the &quot;ride&quot; not in the outcome, and by placing the premise of the film on the inevitability of death, we play a certain philosophical note.

Morgan said:
The main thing they wanted about Death coming to get people is that you never saw a kind of a Michael Myers figure. You never saw a killer. And they liked that idea and they said, &quot;Okay. Go write it.&quot; Once we had a basic story, I started cataloging the strange coincidences in my own life. For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, &quot;Hey, he just died in a plane crashthat&#x27;s a little weird.&quot; We wrote that version of that experience into the script.

Producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions helped with the film&#x27;s budget because both were similarly fascinated about the idea of an invisible force executing its victims. Perry, a fan of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, claimed that he &quot;responded to Wong and Morgan&#x27;s work for one specific reason: dread&quot;. New Line Cinema accepted financing and distributing rights for the film after Reddick came to them personally.

===Casting===
&quot;One of the most important things we were looking for in casting was the actors&#x27; ability to play the subtleties – the little things that a character doesn&#x27;t say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you,&quot; Morgan said about the auditions.

Reddick originally envisioned Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst for the lead roles.

Alex Browning, the last role cast, went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa, who previously starred in the 1999 film &quot;Idle Hands&quot;. Sawa said that when he read the script on a plane, he found himself peeking out the window at the engine every couple of minutes. Then he went down and met Glen and Jim, and he thought &quot;they were amazing and already had some great ideas&quot;. However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa&#x27;s performance in &quot;Idle Hands&quot;, and Sawa was hired. Of the script, Sawa said, &quot;There&#x27;s not a lot of good stuff[. . .] for my age. You get a lot of scripts and all but they&#x27;re teen ensembles and they&#x27;re just crap. And then I got Flight 180[. . .] it&#x27;s just awesome.&quot;

Sawa described his role as &quot;in the beginning, [Alex] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think he might have been a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they&#x27;re after the two beautiful girls in school, but there&#x27;s no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes&quot;. &quot;Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible,&quot; Wong said. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t appear as if he&#x27;s supremely self-assured. He&#x27;s more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero&quot;. Perry was amazed by Sawa&#x27;s vulnerability in acting, describing him as &quot;a very distinctive actor. He&#x27;s very loose and he&#x27;s kind of a cut-up when he&#x27;s not on camera, but the moment the camera&#x27;s on, I&#x27;d never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment&quot;.

Ali Larter, who starred in the 1999 film &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;, was cast as female lead Clear Rivers. &quot;The film shows how easy it is to turn on someone, to blame someone when you&#x27;re scared,&quot; Larter said. &quot;It&#x27;s also about trusting your intuitions and yourself&quot;. She defined her part as &quot;that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself and had made a life within that. She&#x27;s an artist, she lives by herself, and she&#x27;s kinda holding to her grip for what the world has given her&quot;.

Seann William Scott, famous for portraying Steve Stifler in the 1999 film &quot;American Pie&quot;, was hired as class clown Billy Hitchcock. Scott admired the film and felt that &quot;it&#x27;s [as] dark and eerie as any &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;&quot;. He laughed at his role, saying that &quot;[he] is lacking some social skills, he doesn&#x27;t have quite a few friends, and he&#x27;s like the tag-along&quot;. Scott was surprised when in the script his character was written as fat. The writers eventually changed it for Scott.

&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; star Kerr Smith was cast as jock Carter Horton. Smith identified Carter as &quot;your typical high school bully whose life depends on anger&quot; and mentioned the fact that Carter feared Alex not having control of his own life.

Kristen Cloke, Morgan&#x27;s wife, was cast as teacher Valerie Lewton. &quot;I have incredible respect for them,&quot; said Cloke. &quot;Jim&#x27;s the kind of director who knows exactly what he wants. As an actor, I can find a way to get there if I know specifically what I&#x27;m going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won&#x27;t move on until he&#x27;s got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things&quot;. Cloke described her part as &quot;strong and sassy – in control. After the crash, she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it&#x27;s a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that&quot;.

Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad Donella were cast as students Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. &quot;When I first read the script, the thing that struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable,&quot; Detmer said. &quot;That&#x27;s important because you have to care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them&quot;. Detmer defined Terry as &quot;very put-together [and] seems content to defer to [Carter] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her&quot;. On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. &quot;I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you&#x27;re taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan&quot;.

Tony Todd, who played Candyman in the 1992 film &quot;Candyman&quot;, was cast as mortician William Bludworth. Morgan initially wanted Todd for the role because he felt his deep voice would give the film an eerie tone.

Additional cast members included Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as FBI agents Weine and Schreck; Brendan Fehr, Christine Chatelain, and Lisa Marie Caruk as students George Waggner, Blake Dreyer, and Christa Marsh; Barbara Tyson and Robert Wisden as Barbara and Ken Browning, Alex&#x27;s parents; and Forbes Angus as teacher Larry Murnau.

===Filming===
With &quot;Final Destination&quot; cast, filming took place on Long Island for the plane scene and Vancouver Island for the additional scenes. The cast members were filming other projects during production, so filming schedules had to be moved repeatedly for all of the cast to appear. Sawa restrained his appearance in &quot;The Guilty&quot; during production, and even commented that &quot;[he] had to share a trailer with Bill Pullman because it was bigger and would make him look more famous&quot;. Smith, who was a regular in &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, had to hold episodes for the film.

According to Detmer, her death scene (being rammed by a speeding bus) was filmed first because &quot;it was easy but much anticipated&quot;. All death scenes were filmed using lifecasts of the actual actors. The death scenes, the memorial, the forest scene and the scenes in Paris were all filmed in Victoria. Additional scenes were filmed in Toronto and San Francisco. For the airport, the crew used Vancouver International Airport as a stand-in for John F. Kennedy International Airport, the airport mentioned in the film.

===Effects===
The plan behind the scenes was to create an intriguing visual signature. To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of &quot;skewing&quot; the sets. &quot;What I&#x27;ve tried to do with the sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural,&quot; Willet explained. &quot;Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness—the unsettling feeling that something&#x27;s not quite right&quot;. To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set—one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.

&quot;On the skewed sets I force the perspective either vertically or horizontally,&quot; Willet explained. &quot;Nothing is square and, although you can&#x27;t put your finger on it, it just makes you feel like something is not right&quot;. Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. &quot;In the real world, the colors are bright and rich,&quot; Willet said. &quot;In the skewed world, they&#x27;re washed out and faded. Nothing is obvious, and it&#x27;s only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic&quot;.

The plane scene during which passengers die in mid-air was created inside a very large sound stage. The three-ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically. &quot;We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people,&quot; special effects supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the onboard sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. Sawa said that &quot;the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real&quot;. Wong said, &quot;You walk into the studio and there&#x27;s a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, &#x27;What have I done?&#x27; I was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting.&quot;

A miniature model of the Boeing 747 airplane was created for the explosion scene. The model, one of the most detailed miniature scenes in the film, was about 10 feet long and 7 feet wide, and the landing gear was made from all machined metals. According to visual effects supervisor Ariel Velasco Shaw, the miniature had to be launched about 40 feet up into the air to make it look like a real Boeing 747 exploded into a fireball. If blowing up a four-foot plane, the explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in the air. To film the explosion in detail, the crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second (if they had filmed using a real-time camera, the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order).

The train scene (in which Carter&#x27;s car is smashed by the train) was one of the most difficult scenes to shoot. The car used for the crash was a replica of the original, severed in half prior to filming. According to Sonderhoff, in order to ensure the safety of the actors, they had to make sure that there was no real sheet metal in the car.

For the death scenes, the crew used several lifecasts of the actors and chocolate syrup for fake blood. Creating the Rube Goldberg effect for Ms. Lewton&#x27;s death scene was the most difficult to plan according to the crew. Perry said that &quot;it was very hard to generate an atmosphere of dread, to create suspense out of scenes that are common&quot;.

===Music===

====Soundtrack====
No official album accompanied the motion picture. However, six songs are featured in the film, the most prominent of which is &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; by John Denver, which is heavily highlighted throughout the film, reminding the survivors that Denver died in a plane crash. The song is heard either before an accident or a character&#x27;s demise, and is also played by a street performer (Alessandro Juliani) in French. Other songs featured in the film include &quot;Hundred Grand&quot; by Pete Atherton (during the Flight 180 memorial scene), &quot;Into the Void&quot; by Nine Inch Nails (during the café scene), &quot;All the Candles in the World&quot; by Jane Siberry (during Carter&#x27;s car scene), as well as &quot;And When I Die&quot; performed by Joe 90 (during the end credits).

&quot;Final Destination&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on September 26, 2000, by New Line Home Video, in the United States and Canada. The DVD bonus features include three audio commentaries, three deleted scenes, and two documentaries. The first commentary features Wong, Morgan, Reddick, and editor James Coblentz describing the minute subtleties included by the creative team throughout the film, which either allude to death or foreshadow the deaths in the film invisible upon initial airing. They also discuss how the film was made and how they fought the executives of New Line Cinema over various factors.

The second commentary includes Sawa, Smith, Cloke, and Donella discussing what was involved in certain scenes and how they each were cast. The third commentary is the isolated music score of Walker included in the film&#x27;s score.

Deleted scenes cover two subplots of Alex and Clear, an alternate ending where Alex dies after rescuing Clear from the live wires, Clear bearing a baby which she names Alex, and Clear and Carter finishing as the only survivors of the film.

The first documentary entitled &quot;A Look at Test Screenings&quot; runs for 13 minutes and outlines the test screening process, giving an overview of how those screenings were conducted and scored. The featurette shows video footage of the test screening audience and specific comments regarding why the deleted scenes were either cut or reshot.

The featurette runs for 20 minutes. Some DVDs contain two non DVD-ROM games—&quot;Death Clock&quot; and &quot;Psychic Test&quot;—in addition to the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer and filmographies of the cast and crew.

A Blu-ray Disc edition was released on April 7, 2009, retaining a majority of the DVD&#x27;s bonus features.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported 37% of critics gave the film positive write-ups based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus states, &quot;Despite a panel of &quot;X-Files&quot; alums at the helm and a promising premise, flighty performances and poor execution keep &quot;Final Destination&quot; from ever taking off.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. On June 14, 2010, Nick Hyman of &quot;Metacritic&quot; included &quot;Final Destination&quot; in the website&#x27;s editorial &quot;15 Movies the Critics Got Wrong&quot;, noting that &quot;the elaborate suspense/action set pieces from the first two films are more impressive than most&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B− on an A+ to F scale.

On the negative side, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;even by the crude standards of teenage horror, &quot;Final Destination&quot; is dramatically flat&quot;. Kevin Maynard of Mr. Showbiz described the film as &quot;crude and witless&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;your own final destination just might be the box office, to demand your money back&quot;.

Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commented that it &quot;starts by cheating death and ends by cheating us&quot;. Lisa Alspector of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; described the film as &quot;disturbing—if less sophisticated than the best SF (science fiction)-horror TV&quot;. Luke Thompson of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; found it &quot;a waste of a decent premise&quot;; Ernest Hardy of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; said that the film &quot;fails because it takes itself both too seriously and not seriously enough&quot;. Barbara Shulgasser of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that it &quot;met the low standards of a mediocre TV movie&quot;. Walter Addiego of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; thought it was &quot;stupid, silly and gory&quot;.

The film gathered positive reviews from several top critics. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; enjoyed the film and gave it three out of four stars, stating that &quot;&quot;Final Destination&quot; will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original &quot;Scream&quot;, this movie is too good to be the end of the road. I have visions of my own&quot;. He also pointed out the similarities between the circumstances of the plane crash depicted in the movie and the real-life crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, traveling from New York to Paris and carrying students, which he described as being &quot;in the worst possible taste&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised the film, saying &quot;[it] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing&quot;. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, saying &quot;[it] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory&quot;, while Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said it was &quot;a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong&quot;. Chris Kaltenbach of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; found the film &quot;fitfully thrilling&quot;, Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; called the film &quot;serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations&quot;. Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; stated the film was &quot;a flawed but often entertaining teen horror flick&quot;.

Despite the film&#x27;s generally mixed reception, critics praised Sawa&#x27;s performance as Alex. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked &quot;Sawa&#x27;s personable turn as the hero is matched by a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with familiar faces (i.e. Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr, Tony Todd, etc)&quot; while Leydon stated that &quot;Sawa is credible as the second-sighted Alex—unlike many other actors cast as teen protagonists, he actually looks like he might still be attending high school—but the supporting players are an uneven bunch&quot;. LaSalle praised Sawa and Ali Larter&#x27;s pairing, saying that &quot;Larter and Sawa, who becomes more scruffy and wild-eyed as the film progresses, make an appealing pair&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film had a major impact on the horror film audience, earning the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film in 2000. Sawa won the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor the same year, and Larter won the Young Hollywood Award for a Breakthrough Performance by a Female. At the 2001 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, both Sawa and Larter were nominated for Favorite Actor in Horror (Internet Only) and Favorite Actress in Horror (Internet Only), respectively. Both actors lost the awards to &quot;Scream 3&quot; actors David Arquette and Neve Campbell. Additionally, cinematographer Robert McLachlan was nominated for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature at the Canadian Society of Cinematographers Awards in 2001, but lost to Pierre Gill for his work on &quot;The Art of War&quot;.
The film&#x27;s concept was listed at No. 46 in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Scary Moments, in which Smith represented the film. The Flight 180 explosion scene was included in the lists of best fictional plane crashes or disaster scenes by Break Studios, Unreality Magazine, New Movies.net, The Jetpacker, &quot;Maxim&quot;Online, and Filmsite. Filmsite also included the plane scene and the deaths of three characters (Tod, Terry, and Ms. Lewton) in its &quot;Scariest Movie Moments and Scenes&quot;, and all fatalities in its &quot;Best Film Deaths Scenes&quot;. The demise of Detmer&#x27;s character entered the listings of the most shocking deaths on film of George Wales and Simon Kinnear of &quot;Total Film&quot; (No. 29 and No. 10, respectively), Simon Hill of Eat Horror (No. 10), and Dirk Sonningsen of Mania (No. 10).

<text>Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania , is the inorganic compound derived from titanium with the chemical formula . When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6), or [[Colour Index International|CI 77891]]. It is a white solid that is insoluble in water, although mineral forms can appear black. As a pigment, it has a wide range of applications, including paint, sunscreen, and food coloring. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E171. World production in 2014 exceeded 9 million tonnes. It has been estimated that titanium dioxide is used in two-thirds of all pigments, and pigments based on the oxide have been valued at a price of $13.2 billion.
==Structure==
In all three of its main dioxides, titanium exhibits octahedral geometry, being bonded to six oxide anions. The oxides in turn are bonded to three Ti centers. The overall crystal structures of rutile and anatase are tetragonal in symmetry whereas brookite is orthorhombic. The oxygen substructures are all slight distortions of close packing: in rutile, the oxide anions are arranged in distorted hexagonal close-packing, whereas they are close to cubic close-packing in anatase and to &quot;double hexagonal close-packing&quot; for brookite. The rutile structure is widespread for other metal dioxides and difluorides, e.g. RuO2 and ZnF2.

Molten titanium dioxide has a local structure in which each Ti is coordinated to, on average, about 5 oxygen atoms. This is distinct from the crystalline forms in which Ti coordinates to 6 oxygen atoms.

==Synthetic and geologic occurrence==
Synthetic TiO2 is mainly produced from the mineral ilmenite. Rutile, and anatase, naturally occurring TiO2, occur widely also, e.g. rutile as a &#x27;heavy mineral&#x27; in beach sand. Leucoxene, fine-grained anatase formed by natural alteration of ilmenite, is yet another ore. Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from oriented inclusions of rutile needles.

===Mineralogy and uncommon polymorphs===
Titanium dioxide occurs in nature as the minerals rutile and anatase. Additionally two high-pressure forms are known minerals: a monoclinic baddeleyite-like form known as akaogiite, and the other has a slight monoclinic distortion of the orthorhombic α-PbO2 structure and is known as riesite. Both of which can be found at the Ries crater in Bavaria. It is mainly sourced from ilmenite, which is the most widespread titanium dioxide-bearing ore around the world. Rutile is the next most abundant and contains around 98% titanium dioxide in the ore. The metastable anatase and brookite phases convert irreversibly to the equilibrium rutile phase upon heating above temperatures in the range .

Titanium dioxide has twelve known polymorphs – in addition to rutile, anatase, brookite, akaogiite and riesite, three metastable phases can be produced synthetically (monoclinic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic ramsdellite-like), and four high-pressure forms (α-PbO2-like, cotunnite-like, orthorhombic OI, and cubic phases) also exist:

The cotunnite-type phase was claimed to be the hardest known oxide with the Vickers hardness of 38 GPa and the bulk modulus of 431 GPa (i.e. close to diamond&#x27;s value of 446 GPa) at atmospheric pressure. However, later studies came to different conclusions with much lower values for both the hardness (7–20 GPa, which makes it softer than common oxides like corundum Al2O3 and rutile TiO2) and bulk modulus (~300 GPa).

Titanium dioxide (B) is found as a mineral in magmatic rocks and hydrothermal veins, as well as weathering rims on perovskite. TiO2 also forms lamellae in other minerals.

==Production==

The largest pigment processors are Chemours, Venator, , and Tronox. Major paint and coating company end users for pigment grade titanium dioxide include Akzo Nobel, PPG Industries, Sherwin Williams, BASF, Kansai Paints and Valspar. Global pigment demand for 2010 was 5.3 Mt with annual growth expected to be about 3–4%.

The production method depends on the feedstock. In addition to ores, other feedstocks include upgraded slag. Both the chloride process and the sulfate process (both described below) produce titanium dioxide pigment in the rutile crystal form, but the sulfate process can be adjusted to produce the anatase form. Anatase, being softer, is used in fiber and paper applications. The sulfate process is run as a batch process; the chloride process is run as a continuous process.

===Chloride process===
In chloride process, the ore is treated with chlorine and carbon to give titanium tetrachloride, a volatile liquid that is further purified by distillation. The TiCl4 is treated with oxygen to regenerate chlorine and produce the titanium dioxide.

===Sulfate process===
In the sulfate process, ilmenite is treated with sulfuric acid to extract iron(II) sulfate pentahydrate. This process requires concentrated ilmenite (45–60% TiO2) or pretreated feedstocks as a suitable source of titanium. The resulting synthetic rutile is further processed according to the specifications of the end user, i.e. pigment grade or otherwise.

Examples of plants using the sulfate process are the Sorel-Tracy plant of QIT-Fer et Titane and the Eramet Titanium &amp; Iron smelter in Tyssedal Norway.

===Becher process===

The Becher process is another method for the production of synthetic rutile from ilmenite. It first oxidizes the ilmenite as a means to separate the iron component.

===Specialized methods===
For specialty applications, TiO2 films are prepared by various specialized chemistries. Sol-gel routes involve the hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides such as titanium ethoxide:

: Ti(OEt)4 + 2 H2O → TiO2 + 4 EtOH

A related approach that also relies on molecular precursors involves chemical vapor deposition. In this method, the alkoxide is volatilized and then decomposed on contact with a hot surface:

: Ti(OEt)4 → TiO2 + 2 Et2O

==Applications==

===Pigment===
First mass-produced in 1916, titanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials (see &quot;list of indices of refraction&quot;). Titanium dioxide crystal size is ideally around 220 nm (measured by electron microscope) to optimize the maximum reflection of visible light. However, abnormal grain growth is often observed in titanium dioxide, particularly in its rutile phase. The occurrence of abnormal grain growth brings about a deviation of a small number of crystallites from the mean crystal size and modifies the physical behaviour of TiO2. The optical properties of the finished pigment are highly sensitive to purity. As little as a few parts per million (ppm) of certain metals (Cr, V, Cu, Fe, Nb) can disturb the crystal lattice so much that the effect can be detected in quality control. Approximately 4.6 million tons of pigmentary TiO2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as use continues to rise.

TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, supplements, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets), and most toothpastes; in 2019 it was present in two-thirds of toothpastes on the French market. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as &quot;brilliant white&quot;, &quot;the perfect white&quot;, &quot;the whitest white&quot;, or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.

===Food additive===
In food, it is commonly found in ice creams, chocolates, all types of candy, creamers, desserts, marshmallows, chewing gum, pastries, spreads, dressings, cakes, some cheeses, and many other foods.

===Thin films===
When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors; it is also used in generating decorative thin films such as found in &quot;mystic fire topaz&quot;.

Some grades of modified titanium based pigments as used in sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and cosmetics – these are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – in order to have glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers. In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800 °C One example of a pearlescent pigment is Iriodin, based on mica coated with titanium dioxide or iron (III) oxide.

The iridescent effect in these titanium oxide particles is unlike the opaque effect obtained with usual ground titanium oxide pigment obtained by mining, in which case only a certain diameter of the particle is considered and the effect is due only to scattering.

===Sunscreen and UV blocking pigments===
In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. As a sunscreen, ultrafine TiO2 is used, which is notable in that combined with ultrafine zinc oxide, it is considered to be an effective sunscreen that lowers the incidence of sun burns and minimizes the premature photoaging, photocarcinogenesis and immunosuppression associated with long term excess sun exposure. Sometimes these UV blockers are combined with iron oxide pigments in sunscreen to increase visible light protection.

Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are generally considered to be less harmful to coral reefs than sunscreens that include chemicals such as oxybenzone, octocrylene and octinoxate.

Nanosized titanium dioxide is found in the majority of physical sunscreens because of its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled (particle size of 20–40 nm) titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sunscreen lotion because they scatter visible light much less than titanium dioxide pigments, and can give UV protection. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals. Nano-TiO2, which blocks both UV-A and UV-B radiation, is used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.

The EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety considered nano sized titanium dioxide to be safe for skin applications, in concentrations of up to 25 percent based on animal testing. The risk assessment of different titanium dioxide nanomaterials in sunscreen is currently evolving since nano-sized TiO2 is different from the well-known micronized form. The rutile form is generally used in cosmetic and sunscreen products due to it not possessing any observed ability to damage the skin under normal conditions and having a higher UV absorption. In 2016 Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) tests concluded that the use of nano titanium dioxide (95–100% rutile, ≦5% anatase) as a UV filter can be considered to not pose any risk of adverse effects in humans post-application on healthy skin, except in the case the application method would lead to substantial risk of inhalation (ie; powder or spray formulations). This safety opinion applied to nano TiO2 in concentrations of up to 25%.

Initial studies indicated that nano-TiO2 particles could penetrate the skin, causing concern over its use. These studies were later refuted, when it was discovered that the testing methodology couldn&#x27;t differentiate between penetrated particles and particles simply trapped in hair follicles and that having a diseased or physically damaged dermis could be the true cause of insufficient barrier protection.

SCCS research found that when nanoparticles had certain photostable coatings (e.g., alumina, silica, cetyl phosphate, triethoxycaprylylsilane, manganese dioxide), the photocatalytic activity was attenuated and no notable skin penetration was observed; the sunscreen in this research was applied at amounts of 10 mg/cm2 for exposure periods of 24 hours. Coating TiO2 with alumina, silica, zircon or various polymers can minimize avobenzone degradation and enhance UV absorption by adding an additional light diffraction mechanism.

 is used extensively in plastics and other applications as a white pigment or an opacifier and for its UV resistant properties where the powder disperses light – unlike organic UV absorbers – and reduces UV damage, due mostly to the particle&#x27;s high refractive index.

===Other uses of titanium dioxide===
In ceramic glazes, titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation.

It is used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils. Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes which are both oil and water dispersible, and in certain grades for the cosmetic industry. It is also a common ingredient in toothpaste.

The exterior of the Saturn V rocket was painted with titanium dioxide; this later allowed astronomers to determine that J002E3 was likely the S-IVB stage from Apollo 12 and not an asteroid.

Titanium dioxide is an n-type semiconductor and is used in dye-sensitized solar cells. It is also used in other electronics components such as electrodes in batteries.

===Patenting activities===

Between 2002 and 2022, there were 459 patent families that describe the production of titanium dioxide from ilmenite. The majority of these patents describe pre-treatment processes, such as using smelting and magnetic separation to increase titanium concentration in low-grade ores, leading to titanium concentrates or slags. Other patents describe processes to obtain titanium dioxide, either by a direct hydrometallurgical process or through the main industrial production processes, the sulfate process and the chloride process. The sulfate process represents 40% of the world’s titanium dioxide production and is protected in 23% of patent families. The chloride process is only mentioned in 8% of patent families, although it provides 60% of the worldwide industrial production of titanium dioxide. 

Key contributors to patents on the production of titanium dioxide are companies from China, Australia and the United States, reflecting the major contribution of these countries to industrial production. Chinese companies Pangang and Lomon Billions Groups hold major patent portfolios.

===Photocatalyst===
Nanosized titanium dioxide, particularly in the anatase form, exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the {001} planes of anatase, although the {101} planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural anatase, as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit. Interfaces between rutile and anatase are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge carrier separation and as a result, biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst. It has been reported that titanium dioxide, when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide, exhibits excitation also under visible light. The strong oxidative potential of the positive holes oxidizes water to create hydroxyl radicals. It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, deodorizing, and anti-fouling properties, and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst. It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells, which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).

The photocatalytic properties of nanosized titanium dioxide were discovered by Akira Fujishima in 1967 and published in 1972. The process on the surface of the titanium dioxide was called the . In thin film and nanoparticle form, titanium dioxide has the potential for use in energy production: As a photocatalyst, it can break water into hydrogen and oxygen. With the hydrogen collected, it could be used as a fuel. The efficiency of this process can be greatly improved by doping the oxide with carbon. Further efficiency and durability has been obtained by introducing disorder to the lattice structure of the surface layer of titanium dioxide nanocrystals, permitting infrared absorption. Visible-light-active nanosized anatase and rutile has been developed for photocatalytic applications.

In 1995 Fujishima and his group discovered the superhydrophilicity phenomenon for titanium dioxide coated glass exposed to sun light. This resulted in the development of self-cleaning glass and anti-fogging coatings.

Nanosized TiO2 incorporated into outdoor building materials, such as paving stones in noxer blocks or paints, could reduce concentrations of airborne pollutants such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. A TiO2-containing cement has been produced.

Using TiO2 as a photocatalyst, attempts have been made to mineralize pollutants (to convert into CO2 and H2O) in waste water. The photocatalytic destruction of organic matter could also be exploited in coatings with antimicrobial applications.

====Hydroxyl radical formation====
Although nanosized anatase TiO2 does not absorb visible light, it does strongly absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation (&quot;hv&quot;), leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. This occurs when photo-induced valence bond holes (h+vb) are trapped at the surface of TiO2 leading to the formation of trapped holes (h+tr) that cannot oxidize water.

: TiO2 + &quot;hv&quot; → e− + h+vb
: h+vb → h+tr
: O2 + e− → O2•−
: O2•− + O2•−+ 2 → H2O2 + O2
: O2•− + h+vb → O2
: O2•− + h+tr → O2
: + h+vb → HO•
: e− + h+tr → recombination
: Note: Wavelength (λ)= 387 nm This reaction has been found to mineralize and decompose undesirable compounds in the environment, specifically the air and in wastewater.

===Nanotubes===
Anatase can be converted into non-carbon nanotubes and nanowires. Hollow TiO2 nanofibers can be also prepared by coating carbon nanofibers by first applying titanium butoxide.

=== Solubility ===
Titanium dioxide is insoluble in water, organic solvents, and inorganic acids. It is slightly soluble in alkali, soluble in saturated potassium acid carbonate, and can be completely dissolved in strong sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid after boiling for a long time.

==Health and safety==
Widely-occurring minerals and even gemstones are composed of TiO2. All natural titanium, comprising more than 0.5% of the Earth&#x27;s crust, exists as oxides. 

===Food additive===
In 2006, titanium dioxide was, according to one chemical encyclopedia, regarded as &quot;completely nontoxic when orally administered&quot;. However, this is now seriously disputed.

==== Government policies ====
TiO2 whitener in food was banned in France from 2020, due to uncertainty about safe quantities for human consumption.

In 2021, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) ruled that as a consequence of new understandings of nanoparticles, titanium dioxide could &quot;no longer be considered safe as a food additive&quot;, and the EU health commissioner announced plans to ban its use across the EU, with discussions beginning in June 2021. EFSA concluded that genotoxicity—which could lead to carcinogenic effects—could not be ruled out, and that a &quot;safe level for daily intake of the food additive could not be established&quot;. In 2022, the UK Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland announced their disagreement with the EFSA ruling, and did not follow the EU in banning titanium dioxide as a food additive. Health Canada similarly reviewed the available evidence in 2022 and decided not to change their position on titanium dioxide as a food additive.

The European Union removed the authorization to use titanium dioxide (E 171) in foods, effective 7 February 2022, with a six months grace period.

As of May 2023, following the European Union 2022 ban, the U.S. states California and New York were considering banning the use of titanium dioxide in foods.

As of 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States permits titanium dioxide as a food additive. It may be used to increase whiteness and opacity in dairy products (some cheeses, ice cream, and yogurt), candies, frostings, fillings, and many other foods. The FDA regulates the labeling of products containing titanium dioxide, alllowing the product&#x27;s ingredients list to identify titanium dioxide either as &quot;color added&quot; or &quot;artificial colors&quot; or &quot;titanium dioxide;&quot; it does not require that titanium dioxide be explicitly named despite growing scientific concerns. In 2023, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a manufacturer&#x27;s trade group, defended the substance as safe at certain limits while allowing that additional studies could provide further insight, saying an immediate ban would be a &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reaction.

====Industry response====
Dunkin&#x27; Donuts dropped titanium dioxide from their merchandise in 2015 after public pressure. 

====Research as an ingestible nanomaterial====
Due to the potential that long-term ingestion of titanium dioxide may be toxic, particularly to cells and functions of the gastrointestinal tract, preliminary research as of 2021 was assessing its possible role in disease development, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.

Size distribution analyses showed that batches of food-grade TiO₂, which is produced with a target particle size in the 200300nm range for optimal pigmentation qualities, always include a nanoparticle-sized fraction as inevitable byproduct of the manufacturing processes.

Andrew Maynard, director of Risk Science Center at the University of Michigan, rejected the supposed danger from use of titanium dioxide in food. He says that the titanium dioxide used by Dunkin&#x27; Brands and many other food producers is not a new material, and it is not a nanomaterial either. Nanoparticles are typically smaller than 100 nanometres in diameter, yet most of the particles in food-grade titanium dioxide are much larger.

===Inhalation===
Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends two separate exposure limits. NIOSH recommends that fine particles be set at an exposure limit of 2.4 mg/m3, while ultrafine be set at an exposure limit of 0.3 mg/m3, as time-weighted average concentrations up to 10 hours a day for a 40-hour work week.

Although no evidence points to acute toxicity, recurring concerns have been expressed about nanophase forms of these materials. Studies of workers with high exposure to TiO2 particles indicate that even at high exposure there is no adverse effect to human health.

===Environmental waste introduction===
Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) is mostly introduced into the environment as nanoparticles via wastewater treatment plants. Cosmetic pigments including titanium dioxide enter the wastewater when the product is washed off into sinks after cosmetic use. Once in the sewage treatment plants, pigments separate into sewage sludge which can then be released into the soil when injected into the soil or distributed on its surface. 99% of these nanoparticles wind up on land rather than in aquatic environments due to their retention in sewage sludge. In the environment, titanium dioxide nanoparticles have low to negligible solubility and have been shown to be stable once particle aggregates are formed in soil and water surroundings. In the process of dissolution, water-soluble ions typically dissociate from the nanoparticle into solution when thermodynamically unstable. TiO2 dissolution increases when there are higher levels of dissolved organic matter and clay in the soil. However, aggregation is promoted by pH at the isoelectric point of TiO2 (pH= 5.8) which renders it neutral and solution ion concentrations above 4.5 mM.

<text>The Valley of Cuelgamuros (Spanish: &quot;Valle de Cuelgamuros&quot;), commonly known as the Valley of the Fallen (Spanish: &quot;Valle de los Caídos&quot;), is a monument in the Sierra de Guadarrama, near Madrid. The valley contains a Catholic basilica and a monumental memorial in the municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Dictator Francisco Franco ordered the construction of the monumental site in 1940; it was built from 1940 to 1958, and opened in 1959. Franco said that the monument was intended as a &quot;national act of atonement&quot; and reconciliation. The site served as Franco&#x27;s burial place from his death in November 1975—although it was not originally intended that he be buried there—until his exhumation on 24 October 2019 following a long and controversial legal process due to moves to remove all public honoration of his dictatorship.

The monument, considered a landmark of 20th-century Spanish architecture, was designed by Pedro Muguruza and Diego Méndez on a scale to equal, according to Franco, &quot;the grandeur of the monuments of old, which defy time and memory&quot;. Together with the &quot;Universidad Laboral de Gijón&quot;, it is the most prominent example of the original Spanish Neo-Herrerian style, which was intended to form part of a revival of Juan de Herrera&#x27;s architecture, exemplified by the nearby royal residence El Escorial. This uniquely Spanish architecture was widely used in public buildings of post-war Spain and is rooted in international fascist classicism as exemplified by Albert Speer or Mussolini&#x27;s Esposizione Universale Roma.

The monument precinct covers over of Mediterranean woodlands and granite boulders on the Sierra de Guadarrama hills, more than above sea level and includes a basilica, a Benedictine abbey, a guest house, the Valley, and the &quot;Juanelos&quot;—four cylindrical monoliths dating from the 16th century. The most prominent feature of the monument is the towering Christian cross, the tallest such cross in the world, erected over a granite outcrop 150 metres over the basilica esplanade and visible from over away. Work started in 1940 and took over eighteen years to complete, with the monument being officially inaugurated on 1 April 1959. According to the official ledger, the cost of the construction totalled 1,159 million pesetas, funded through national lottery draws and donations. Some of the labourers were prisoners who traded their labour for a reduction in time served.

The complex is owned and operated by the Patrimonio Nacional, the Spanish governmental heritage agency, and ranked as the third most visited monument of the Patrimonio Nacional in 2009. The Spanish social democrat government closed the complex to visitors at the end of 2009, citing safety reasons connected to restoration on the façade. The decision was controversial, as the closure was attributed by some people to the Historical Memory Law enacted during José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&#x27;s premiership, and there were claims that the Benedictine community was being persecuted. The works include the Pietà sculpture prominently featured at the entrance of the crypt, using hammers and heavy machinery.

== Basilica, cross and abbey ==
One of the world&#x27;s largest basilicas rises above the valley along with the tallest memorial cross in the world. The &quot;Basílica de la Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos&quot; (Basilica of the Holy Cross of the Valley of the Fallen) is hewn out of a granite ridge. The cross is constructed of stone. In 1960, Pope John XXIII declared the underground crypt a basilica. The dimensions of this underground basilica, as excavated, are larger than those of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. To avoid competition with the apostle&#x27;s grave church on the Vatican Hill, a partitioning wall was built near the inside of the entrance and a sizeable entryway was left unconsecrated. The memorial sculptures to the fallen at the basilica are works by Spanish sculptor Luis Sanguino.

The monumental sculptures over the main gate and the base of the cross culminated the career of Juan de Ávalos. The monument consists of a wide &quot;explanada&quot; (esplanade) with views of the valley and the outskirts of Madrid in the distance. A long vaulted crypt was tunnelled out of solid granite, piercing the mountain to the massive transept, which lies exactly below the cross.
On the wrought-iron gates, Franco&#x27;s neo-Habsburg double-headed eagle is prominently displayed. On entering the basilica, visitors are flanked by two large metal statues of art deco angels holding swords. There is a funicular that connects the basilica with the base of the cross. There is a spiral staircase and a lift inside the cross, connecting the top of the basilica dome to a trapdoor on top of the cross, but their use is restricted to maintenance staff. The Benedictine Abbey of the Holy Cross of the Valley of the Fallen (), on the other side of the mountain, houses priests who say perpetual Masses for the repose of the fallen of the Spanish Civil War and later wars and peacekeeping missions fought by the Spanish Army. The abbey ranks as a Royal Monastery.

== Valley of the Fallen ==
The valley that contains the monument, preserved as a national park, is located 10 km northeast of the royal site of El Escorial, northwest of Madrid. Beneath the valley floor lie the remains of 40,000 people, whose names are accounted for in the monument&#x27;s register. The valley contains both Nationalist and Republican graves, but the dedication written in stone reads &quot;Caídos por Dios y por España&quot; (Fallen for God and for Spain, which is criticized because it was the Francoist Spain motto) and numerous symbols of the Francoist regime. Moroever, Republicans were interred here mostly without the consent or even the knowledge of their families; some estimates claim that there are 33,800 victims of Francoism interred — and their families have legal problems in recovering the remains of their family member. Franco was exhumed and removed from the church in 2019 as an effort to discourage public veneration of the site.


== Franco&#x27;s tomb (1975–2019) ==

After the dictator&#x27;s death, the interim Government led by Prince Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro designated the site in 1975 as his burial place. Franco&#x27;s family, when asked if they had any opinion on where he should be buried, said they had none. According to a friend and colleague of Arias, the decision to bury Franco in the Valley was not made by Franco or his family, but probably by the king. The family agreed to the interim Government&#x27;s request to bury him in the Valley, and has stood by the decision.

Before his death, nobody had expected that Franco would be buried in the Valley. Moreover, the grave had to be excavated and prepared within two days, forcing last minute changes in the plumbing system of the Basilica. Unlike the fallen of the Civil War who were laid to rest in tombs behind the chapels on the sides of the basilica, Franco was buried behind the main altar, in the central nave. His grave is marked by a tombstone engraved with just his given name and first surname, on the choir side of the main high altar (between the altar and the apse of the Church; behind the altar, from the perspective of a person standing at the main door). Franco is the only person interred in the Valley who did not die in the Civil War. The argument given by the defenders of his tomb is that in the Catholic Church the developer of a church can be buried in the church that he has promoted, therefore Franco would be in the Valley as the promoter of the basilica&#x27;s construction.

Franco was the second person interred in the Santa Cruz basilica. Franco had earlier interred José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange movement, who was executed by the Republican government in 1936 and was buried by the Francoist government under a modest gravestone on the nave side of the altar. Primo de Rivera died on 20 November 1936, exactly 39 years before Franco. His grave is in the corresponding position on the other side of the altar. Accordingly, 20 November is annually commemorated by large crowds of Franco supporters and various Falange successor movements and individuals, flocking to the Requiem Masses held for the repose of the souls of their political leaders.

===Exhumation and removal of Franco&#x27;s remains===
On 29 November 2011 the Expert Commission for the Future of the Valley of the Fallen, formed by the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero on 27 May 2011 under the Historical Memory Law and charged to give advice for converting the Valley to a &quot;memory centre that dignifies and rehabilitates the victims of the Civil War and the subsequent Franco regime,&quot; rendered a report recommending as its principal proposal for the commission&#x27;s stated end the removal of the remains of Franco from the Valley for reburial at a location to be chosen by his family, but only after first obtaining a broad parliamentary consensus for such action. The Commission based its decision upon Franco having not died in the Civil War and the aim of the Commission that the Valley be exclusively for those on both sides who had died in the Civil War. In regard to Primo de Rivera the Commission recommended, since he was a victim of the Civil War, his remains should stay at the Valley but relocated within the Basilica mausoleum on equal footing with those remains of others who died in the conflict. The Commission further conditioned its recommendation for the removal of the remains of Franco from the Valley and the relocation of the remains of Primo de Rivera within the Basilica mausoleum upon the consent of the Catholic Church since &quot;any action inside of the Basilica requires the permission of the Church.&quot; Three members of the twelve person commission gave a joint dissenting opinion opposing the recommendation for the removal of the remains of Franco from the Valley claiming such action would only further &quot;divide and stress Spanish society.&quot; The Commission additionally proposed for its report creating a &quot;meditation centre&quot; in the Valley for those not of the Catholic faith, the names shown on the esplanade that leads into the Basilica mausoleum of all Civil War victims buried at the Valley who can be identified and an &quot;interpretive centre&quot; be built to explain how and why the Valley exists. The total cost of the proposed changes to the Valley was estimated by the Commission at €13 million. On 20 November, nine days before the issuance of the report of the commission and ironically on the 36th anniversary of the death of Franco, the conservative Popular Party (PP) won for the 2011 General Election absolute majorities in both Spain&#x27;s lower house, the Congress of Deputies and Senate.

On 15 March 2019, the government of Pedro Sanchez announced that Franco would be exhumed and reburied at Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo with his wife Carmen Polo, and that the exhumation would take place on 10 June 2019, assuming the Supreme Court did not issue a precautionary order preventing the exhumation until a decision for those appeals of the Franco family and Benedictine Community presently before it. On 19 March 2019, the Francisco Franco National Foundation filed an appeal with the Supreme Court contending the February agreement of the Council of Ministers for the exhumation is &quot;null and void&quot; for violating &quot;openly&quot; not only the Constitution, but as well the royal decree that modifies the law of Historical Memory and &quot;all the regulations that make up the legal regime&quot; of the B, in addition to European laws and regulations. The Franco Foundation further prayed the Supreme Court stay any action to remove the remains of Franco during the pendency of its appeal. On 4 June 2019 the five magistrates of the Fourth Administrative Contentious Division of the Supreme Court unanimously suspended the exhumation pending a final decision for those appeals in opposition to the exhumation filed by the Franco Family, the Benedictine Community, the Franco Foundation and the Association for the Defense of the Valley of the Fallen.

On 24 September 2019 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favour of exhumation and rejected the arguments put forward by Franco&#x27;s family. It was reported that the exhumation could take place before 10 November 2019 Spanish election and would inter Franco&#x27;s remains in the El Pardo Cemetery. On 24 October 2019, in the presence of Franco&#x27;s relatives and Dolores Delgado, Spain&#x27;s Minister of Justice, the coffin containing Franco&#x27;s remains was exhumed from the basilica in the Valley of the Fallen. The coffin was carried out into the plaza by members of the dictator&#x27;s family, who exclaimed: ′&quot;¡Viva España! ¡Viva Franco!&quot;′ (′Long live Spain! Long live Franco!′) as they lowered it into a hearse. It was then secured in a waiting helicopter, which transported it to the Mingorrubio-El Pardo municipal cemetery, where Franco was reburied alongside his wife, Carmen Polo. The Franco family chose Ramón Tejero, an Andalucían parish priest, and son of the Guardia Civil lieutenant colonel Antonio Tejero, who violently stormed the Spanish Parliament during the unsuccessful military coup on 23 February 1981, to say mass at the reinterment ceremony.

==Controversy==

Presenting the monument in a politically neutral way poses a number of problems, not least of which is the strength of opposing opinions on the issue. &quot;The Times&quot; quoted Jaume Bosch, a Catalan politician and former MP seeking to change the monument, as saying: &quot;I want what was in reality something like a Nazi concentration camp to stop being a nostalgic place of pilgrimage for Francoists. Inevitably, whether we like it or not, it&#x27;s part of our history. We don&#x27;t want to pull it down, but the Government has agreed to study our plan.&quot;

The charge that the monument site was &quot;like a Nazi concentration camp&quot; refers to the use of convict labour, including Republican prisoners, who traded their labour for a reduction in time served. Although Spanish law prohibited the use of slave labour at the time, it did provide for convicts to choose voluntary work on the basis of redeeming two days of conviction for each day worked. This law remained in force until 1995. This benefit was increased to six days when labour was carried out at the basilica with a salary of 7 pesetas per day, a regular worker&#x27;s salary at the time, with the possibility that the family of the convict would benefit from the housing and Catholic children&#x27;s schools that were built in the valley for them by the other workers. Only convicts with a record of good behaviour would qualify for this redemption scheme, because the work site was considered to be a low security environment. The motto used by the Nationalist government was &quot;el trabajo ennoblece&quot; (&quot;work ennobles&quot;).

It is claimed that by 1943 the number of prisoners who were working at the site reached close to six hundred. It is also claimed that up to 20,000 prisoners were used for the overall construction of the monument and that forced labour was used. According to the official programme records, 2,643 workers directly participated in the construction, and some of them were highly skilled, as was required by the complexity of the work. 243 of these were convicts. During the eighteen-year construction period, the official tally of workers who died as a result of accidents totalled fourteen.

The socialist Spanish government of 2004–2011 instituted a statewide policy of removal of Francoist symbols from public buildings and spaces, leading to an uneasy relationship with a monument that is the most conspicuous legacy of Franco&#x27;s rule. Political rallies in celebration of Franco are now banned by the Historical Memory Law, voted on by the Congress of Deputies on 16 October 2007. This law dictated that &quot;the management organisation of the Valley of the Fallen should aim to honour the memory of all of those who died during the civil war and who suffered repression&quot;. It has been suggested that the Valley of the Fallen be re-designated as a &quot;monument to Democracy&quot; or as a memorial to all Spaniards killed in conflict &quot;for Democracy&quot;. Some organisations, among them centrist Catholic groups, question the purpose of these plans, on the basis that the monument is already dedicated to all of the dead, civilian and military of both Nationalist and Republican sides. The Democratic Memory Law of October 2022 envisaged the future of the Valley of the Fallen as a civil cemetery. As Primo de Rivera had required a Catholic burial, his family arranged for his body be exhumed from the Valley in April 2023 and reburied in Saint Isidore Cemetery in Madrid.

== Closure and reopening of the monument ==
In November 2009, Patrimonio Nacional controversially ordered the closure of the basilica for an indefinite period of time, alleging preservation issues also affecting the Cross and some sculptures. These allegations were contested by some experts and by the Benedictine Order religious community that lives at the complex, and were seen by some conservative opinion groups as a policy of harassment against the monument. In 2010, the Pietà sculpture group started to be &quot;dismantled&quot; with hammers and heavy machinery, which the Juan de Ávalos trust feared could cause irreparable damage to the sculpture. As a result, thereof, the trust filed several lawsuits against the Spanish government. At the time, several parallels were made by conservative and liberal groups between the dismantling of the Pietà under the PSOE government and the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan by the Taliban.

Following the 2011 Spanish general election, on 1 June 2012 the conservative PP government of Mariano Rajoy reopened the monument to the public with the exception only of the base of the cross, in the past accessible by cable car or on foot, which will remain closed to ascent while the sculptures of the four apostles and the cardinal virtues forming part of the base of the cross are presently under engineering review and restoration for cracks and other deterioration. Before the official reopening on 1 June 2012, access for the public to the basilic was already possible in 2011. Beginning on 1 June 2012 the charge for entry to the monument had been 5 euros. The 5 euro entry fee was anticipated to generate around 2 million euros a year if the Valley of the Fallen once again attracted 500,000 visitors annually, the approximate number of annual visitors before closure of the monument in 2009 by the PSOE government. Starting on 2 May 2013, and over the strong objection of the Association for the Defense of the Valley of the Fallen, the entry fee for the monument was increased from 5 to 9 euros. Prior to its closure in 2009, the Valley of the Fallen was the third most visited site of the Patrimonio Nacional after only the Royal Palace of Madrid and El Escorial. For the accommodation of visitors a cafeteria restaurant located in the cable car building of the monument has been re-opened. The Valley of the Fallen attracted 254,059 visitors in 2015, 262,860 visitors in 2016 and 283,263 visitors in 2017. There were 378,875 visitors in 2018 to the Valley of the Fallen and 318,248 visitors in 2019.

==In popular culture==

The Valle de los Caídos appears in Richard Morgan&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, where it is being used as a base of operations for one of the major antagonists, Reileen Kawahara. It also appears in the 2010 Spanish dark comedy film &quot;The Last Circus&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Balada triste de trompeta&quot;), as a visual homage to the climactic Mount Rushmore scene in the Hitchcock classic &quot;North by Northwest&quot;.

Graham Greene&#x27;s 1982 novel &quot;Monsignor Quixote&quot; uses a visit to the Valle to illustrate the competing political and social attitudes to Franco&#x27;s reign and the status of his tomb in modern Spain. There is also a large reference to this monument and the labourers who built it in Victoria Hislop&#x27;s book &quot;The Return&quot;. In 2013, Spain saw the release of the film (, &quot;In the Shadow of the Cross&quot;) directed by the Italian filmmaker Alessandro Pugno. The film tells the secret story of the children of the chorus who sing every day in the mass. They live in a boarding school inside the monument and receive a traditional education. The film was awarded with the first prize for the best documentary at Festival de Málaga de Cine Español.

In the 2016 film &quot;The Queen of Spain&quot;, actor Antonio Resines plays Blas Fontiverosa, a film director who returns to Spain after fleeing following the Civil War and is captured and forced to work on the construction of the Valley. Also in 2016, Mayor of Madrid Manuela Carmena, proposed to change the site&#x27;s name from &quot;El Valle de los Caídos&quot; to &quot;El Valle de la Paz&quot; (The Valley of Peace).

The monument&#x27;s construction and significance is paralleled with that of El Escorial in Carlos Fuentes’s 1975 novel &quot;Terra Nostra&quot;. The monument&#x27;s name is the title of a 1978 novel by the Spanish author Carlos Rojas Vila. Part of the novel&#x27;s plot is set in the late days of the Francoist Spain. The monument appears in Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;Origin&quot;. The monument is referenced in Ruta Sepetys&#x27; 2019 novel &quot;Fountains of Silence&quot;. The monument appears in Edwin Torres&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; in a scene where the protagonist, Carlito Brigante, is setting up an informant for a hit.

<text>Aegidius (died 464 or 465) was the ruler of the short-lived Kingdom of Soissons from 461 to 464/465. Before his ascension he was an ardent supporter of the Western Roman emperor Majorian, who appointed him &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot; (&quot;Master of the Soldiers for Gaul&quot;) in 458. After the general Ricimer assassinated Majorian and replaced him with Emperor Libius Severus, Aegidius rebelled and began governing his Gallic territory as an independent kingdom. He may have pledged his allegiance to the Eastern Roman emperor Leo I.

Aegidius repeatedly threatened to invade Italy and dethrone Libius Severus, but never actually launched such an invasion; historians have suggested he was unwilling to launch an invasion due to the pressure of the Visigoths, or else because it would leave Gaul exposed. Aegidius launched several campaigns against the Visigoths and the Burgundians, recapturing Lyon from the Burgundians in 458, and routing the Visigoths at the Battle of Orleans. He died suddenly after a major victory against the Visigoths; ancient historians say that he was assassinated, but do not give the name of the assassin, whereas modern historians believe it is possible that he died a natural death.

After his death, he was succeeded by his son Syagrius, who was the last ruler of the Kingdom of Soissons.

==History==

Aegidius was born in Gaul, a province of the Western Roman Empire. It is believed that he came from the aristocratic Syagrii family, based upon the name of his son, Syagrius. While this evidence is not absolute, modern historians consider a connection to the family likely, by birth or marriage. Aegidius served under Aetius during the latter&#x27;s time as &quot;magister militum&quot; (master of soldiers) of the Western Roman Empire. He also served alongside the future emperor Majorian.

Aegidius was either a founding member of Majorian and Ricimer&#x27;s faction, or else he quickly joined it, wielding considerable influence with Majorian. After Majorian became Western Roman emperor, Aegidius was granted the title &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot; in 458 as a reward for his loyalty.

The Ripuarian Franks conquered Cologne and Trier from the Romans 457, and Aegidius was besieged in Arles by the Visigoths under King Theodoric II for a time in 457/458, before Majorian defeated him. In the same year, Aegidius led troops at the Battle of Arelate against the Visigoths, where he is credited by ancient sources as being the primary cause for Theodoric II&#x27;s defeat.

As a result of the battle, Theodoric II was forced to return Visigoth territory in Hispania to the Western Roman Empire and submit again to being a Roman vassal. Aegidius also recaptured Lyons from the Burgundians in 458.

After Ricimer assassinated Emperor Majorian in 461 and replaced him with Libius Severus, Aegidius refused to recognize the new emperor. Libius Severus was not recognized by the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo I, who was considered the senior emperor. Aegidius may have pledged his allegiance directly to Leo I in order to legitimize his independence from the Western Roman Empire, and his retention of the Gallic legions.

Aegidius repeatedly threatened to invade Italy; however, he never did so. Modern historian Penny MacGeorge has suggested that this was due to pressure from the Visigoths, whereas others assert that he was unable or unwilling to march to Italy, leaving Gaul exposed.

Around this time war had broken out Aegidius&#x27; lands and the Visigoths, over borders, and Aegidius was said by Priscus to have distinguished himself in the fighting. It is known that during this time, Ricimer ceded Lyons to the Burgundians, and Narbonne and most of Narbonensis Prima to the Visigoths, in exchange for alliances. Ricimer probably appointed a replacement for Aegidius, despite the fact that Aegidius retained most or all of his Gallic forces. The two people most likely to have been given the title of &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot; (master of soldiers in Gaul) were the Roman general Agrippinus, whom Aegidius had previously accused of treason, or the Burgundian King Gundioc, who was Ricimer&#x27;s brother-in-law. Around this time Aegidius sent embassies to the Vandal king Gaiseric, probably in an effort to form an alliance to oppose Ricimer. 

According to a story known to Gregory of Tours and the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;, the Frankish King Childeric I, who controlled much of northern Gaul, was exiled at some point after 457, and the Franks then elected Aegidius to rule them. The ancient sources go on to say that Aegidius ruled them for eight years before Childeric was recalled and reinstated as king. This story is considered fictional by most modern historians. Another narrative given by primary sources is that Childeric formed an alliance with Aegidius, although this has slim historical evidence, and is directly opposed by archeological evidence, which supports the theory of the Kingdom of Soissons, the historiographic name given to territory ruled by Aegidius and his son Syagrius, containing the expansion of the Franks. Ernst Stein suggests that the Franks may have placed themselves under Roman rule in the absence of Childeric. Michael Kulikowski posits that his (armies) were so heavily Frankish at this point, that he could fairly be remembered as a king, rather than general.

Aegidius repulsed an invasion by the Visigoths in 463, routing them at the Battle of Orleans. In this battle, Aegidius&#x27; forces killed the Visigoth general Frederic, who was the brother of Theodoric. Some sources say that Aegidius&#x27; forces were bolstered by Frankish forces. Aegidius also won a minor engagement against the Visigoths near Chinon, at an unknown date. Despite these victories, he did not take the offensive against the Visigothic position in Aquitaine, possibly due to lack of resources, or due to threats from &quot;comes&quot; (count) Paulus, Gundioc, and the Western Roman generals Arbogast and Agrippinus. He sent a diplomatic party to the Visigoths in May 464, which would not return until September of that year.

Aegidius is recorded to have died suddenly, in autumn of 465. Sources of the time report that he was either ambushed or poisoned, but do not mention a perpetrator. Most modern historians consider it possible that he died a natural death, although some, such as Kulikowski, challenge this. After his death, he was succeeded by his son Syagrius. Syagrius is reported to have moved his seat of government to Soissons, which would later give Aegidius and Syagrius&#x27; breakaway government the historiographic name of the Kingdom of Soissons. The Franks defeated Syagrius and captured Soissons in the 480s.

==Historiography==
Aegidius was referred to by numerous titles in primary sources, many of which were contradictory. In the &quot;Historia Francorum&quot; by Gregory of Tours, he is twice called &quot;magister militum&quot; (Master of Soldiers), although Gregory describes him as being elected &quot;rex&quot; (king) of the Franks. Even more confusingly, Gregory does not give him any title while mentioning his death. The &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; refers to him initially as &quot;rex&quot;, but later twice calls him &quot;principem Romanorum&quot; (the Roman emperor). In the &#x27;A&#x27; version of the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, he is called &quot;Romanorum rex&quot; (King of the Romans) at the time of his death, while the &#x27;B&#x27; version calls him &quot;Romanorum tirannus&quot; (Roman tyrant), implying that he was a usurper. The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; calls him &quot;comes&quot; (count). Based on the two references from the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; which refer to him as emperor, and the occasional usage of the title of &quot;rex&quot; to refer to an emperor, some have asserted that he was in fact an emperor, although this is based upon shaky evidence, and is considered very unlikely by most historians. Modern historians give three possibilities for his actual status: The first possibility is that he declared himself king, and was called such by both his own kingdom and external barbarians. The second is that he was never called king within his own lifetime, but later folk or epic traditions gave him the title. The third is that he was referred to by a Roman title by his subjects, but called &quot;rex&quot; by barbarians, as it was analogous to the titles of their own rulers.

Information regarding his place of birth and his son comes from Gregory of Tours, the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;, and the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;. His service with Majorian under Aetius is related by Priscus, who also mentions his subsequent influence with Majorian as emperor. His elevation to is given by Gregory and Hydatius. The loss of Cologne and Trier is provided by the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, and his encirclement in Arles by Paulinus of Périgueux&#x27;s &quot;Life of St. Martin&quot; and Gregory. His accusation of treason against Agrippinus, whom he accused of surrendering the empire to barbarians, is known from the &quot;Vita Lupicini&quot;, which calls the claim maliciously false. Priscus also states Aegidius&#x27; refusal to recognize Libius Severus, and his threats to invade Italy, and he and Gregory speak to the conflict between Aegidius and the Visigoths. His continued dispute with Agrippinus and the Battle of Orleans is granted by Hydatius, Marius Aventicensis, and Gregory. The envoy he sent to the Visigoths is spoken of by Hydatius alone. Hydatius and Gregory both give the narrative of his death, and Gregory relates that he had invoked the help of St. Martin of Tours while in danger. Paulinus praises his bravery, character, and piety.

<text>Appeal to emotion or argumentum ad passiones (meaning the same in Latin) is an informal fallacy characterized by the manipulation of the recipient&#x27;s emotions in order to win an argument, especially in the absence of factual evidence. This kind of appeal to emotion is irrelevant to or distracting from the facts of the argument (a so-called &quot;red herring&quot;) and encompasses several logical fallacies, including appeal to consequences, appeal to fear, appeal to flattery, appeal to pity, appeal to ridicule, appeal to spite, and wishful thinking.

Appeal to emotion is an application of social psychology. It is only fallacious when the emotions that are elicited are irrelevant to evaluating the truth of the conclusion and serve to distract from rational consideration of relevant premises or information. For instance, if a student says &quot;If I get a failing grade for this paper I will lose my scholarship. It&#x27;s not plagiarized.&quot; the emotions elicited by the first statement are not relevant to establishing whether the paper was plagiarized. Also, the statement &quot;Look at the suffering children. We must do more for refugees.&quot; is fallacious, because the suffering of the children and our emotional perception of the badness of suffering is not relevant to the conclusion (to be sure, the proper role, if any, for emotion in moral reasoning is a contested issue in ethics).

Appeals to emotion are intended to cause the recipient of the information to experience feelings such as fear, pity, or joy, with the end goal of convincing the person that the statements being presented by the fallacious argument are true or false, respectively.

==Classical times==
The power of emotions to influence judgment, including political attitudes, has been recognized since classical antiquity. Aristotle, in his treatise &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, described emotional arousal as critical to persuasion, &quot;The orator persuades by means of his hearers, when they are roused to emotion by his speech; for the judgments we deliver are not the same when we are influenced by joy or sorrow, love or hate.&quot; Aristotle warned that emotions may create beliefs where none existed, or change existing beliefs, and may enhance or decrease the strength with which a belief is held. Seneca similarly warned that &quot;Reason herself, to whom the reins of power have been entrusted, remains mistress only so long as she is kept apart from the passions.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Centuries later, French scientist and philosopher, Blaise Pascal wrote that &quot;People [...] arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof, but on the basis of what they find attractive.&quot; Baruch Spinoza characterized emotions as having the power to &quot;make the mind inclined to think one thing rather than another.&quot; Disagreeing with Seneca the Younger that emotion destroys reason, the 18th century Scottish philosopher George Campbell argued, instead, that emotions were allies of reason, and that they aid in the assimilation of knowledge. However, Campbell warned of the malleability of emotion and the consequent risk in terms of suggestibility:

::[Emotions] are not supplanters of reason, or even rivals in her sway; they are her handmaids, by whose ministry she is enabled to usher truth into the heart, and procure it to favorable reception. As handmaids, they are liable to be seduced by sophistry in the garb of reason, and sometimes are made ignorantly to lend their aid in the introduction of falsehood.

Propaganda theorist Edward Bernays asserted confidently that &quot;in certain cases we can effect some change in public opinion with a fair degree of accuracy by operating a certain mechanism, just as a motorist can regulate the speed of his car by manipulating the flow of gasoline.&quot; Bernays advised that to change the attitudes of the masses, a propagandist should target its &quot;impulses, habits and emotions&quot; and make &quot;emotional currents&quot; work to achieve the goal.

Indeed, some contemporary authors have attributed the popularity of the most destructive political forces in modern history to the ability of their propagandists to enchant (rather than convince) publics and to oppose &quot;the heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor&quot; to &quot;naked self interest&quot; and individualism.

Similarly, Drew Westen, professor of psychology psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University, using current psychiatric and psychological research to demonstrate the power of emotions in affecting political cognition and preferences, wrote that, &quot;when reason and emotion collide, emotion invariably wins&quot;. Westen, an advisor to Democratic political campaigns, believes that evolution has equipped people to process information by emotions and that people respond to emotional cues more than to rational arguments. Accordingly, Westen believes that emotion is vital for effective persuasion and that appeals to emotion will always be more effective appeals to reason:

::A central aspect of the art of political persuasion is creating, solidifying, and activating networks that create primarily positive feelings toward your candidate or party and negative feelings toward the opponent …

::You can slog it for those few millimeters of cerebral turf that process facts, figures and policy statements. Or you can … target different emotional states with messages designed to maximize their appeal.

==Modern theories==

A social psychology theory suggests that attitudes have three components — affect, cognition and behavior. The cognitive dimension refers &quot;to beliefs that one holds about the attitude object, and behavior has been used to describe overt actions and responses to the attitude object&quot;. Affect, meanwhile, describes &quot;the positive and negative feelings that one holds toward an attitude object&quot;, that is, the emotional dimension of an attitude. Modern theorists have modified the tripartite theory to argue that an attitude &quot;does not consist of these elements, but is instead a general evaluative summary of the information derived from these bases.&quot;

Political scientist George Marcus (writing with Russell Neuman and Michael Mackuen) identifies two mental systems through which reason and emotion interact in managing and processing political stimuli:

::First, the disposition system &quot;provides people with an understanding, an emotional report card, about actions that are already in their repertoire of habits.&quot; That is, the first system is that which monitors the casual processing of political information through habit, through which most of our information processing is done.

The second system, the surveillance system, &quot;acts to scan the environment for novelty and sudden intrusion of threat.&quot; In other words, the second system monitors the environment for any signs of threat. If a threat is found, that system takes people out of habitual, casual processing and puts them in a state of alertness and receptivity to new information:

::&quot;what is interesting about this second emotional system is that the onset of increased anxiety stops ongoing activity and orients attention to the threatening appearance so that learning can take place. [...] when the system detects unexpected of threatening stimuli, however, it evokes increased anxiety, it interrupts ongoing activity, and it shifts attention away from the previous focus and toward the intrusive stimuli.&quot;

Marcus further argues that &quot;emotional engagement will motivate people toward making more deeply reasoned decisions about politics than those who remain dispassionate&quot;. Other people have argued that &quot;when an emotion is aroused and experienced, it can involve a number of psychological processes that can then be used as a platform for promoting and securing influence and compliance&quot;.

Regardless, it would stand to reason, then, that affecting a subject&#x27;s emotional state, in conjunction with a political message, could affect that subject&#x27;s attitudes.

In modern philosophy, there are two main types of appeal to emotion. One is the appeal to force (known as &quot;ad baculum&quot;), the other is the appeal to sympathy, known as &quot;ad misericordiam&quot;. These are only considered fallacies when used for doxastic systems.

==Research==

Accepted wisdom is that, &quot;[w]hen it comes to issues of emotional importance, convincing someone to change his or her existing beliefs appears to be a virtually hopeless undertaking.&quot; And yet, manipulating emotions may help change attitudes:
::&quot;[t]he use of emotions to instill beliefs is prevalent in political propaganda. Depicting individuals, groups, or issues from an emotional perspective, or as actors in emotional events, evokes emotion. It thereby slips the belief that the emotion is about into the listener&#x27;s mind. Presumably, it slips the beliefs into the listener&#x27;s mind more easily, smoothly and unquestioned than would happen when the information alone was transmitted.&quot;

Though it is still an underdeveloped topic of research, a number of scholars are demonstrating that manipulating emotions concerning a persuasive message does affect that message&#x27;s effectiveness. It has been shown, for example, that people tend to adjust their beliefs to conform with their emotions, since feelings are treated by people as evidence, and when feelings match beliefs, that is considered as validation of the beliefs. Other research shows that &quot;emotional stimuli can influence judgment without a judge&#x27;s awareness of having seen or felt anything (e.g., Bargh, 1997; Murphy &amp; Zajonc, 1993).&quot;

Indeed, &quot;recent studies have confirmed that affect does play a general role in attitude change, whether due to persuasive communication, or to cognitive dissonance processes (Petty et al., 2001)&quot;.

Psychologists Petty &amp; Cacioppo found that there are two ways of processing persuasive messages: (1) to emphasize the content and quality of the message (central processing), or (2) to emphasize instead external cues (such as the source of the message) and to disregard its content (peripheral processing). &quot;When participants use the central/systematic route of responding to message content, they tend to be persuaded more by strong arguments, and less by weak arguments. However, the strength of the argument matters less when the peripheral route is chosen. In that case, other &quot;peripheral&quot; factors, such as the credibility of the source of the message or the intention of the communicator become important in the persuasive process.&quot; Petty and Cacioppo suggest that negative affect should result in more central processing and positive affect to more peripheral processing. That is, &quot;In happy moods, people tend to be persuaded equally by strong and weak arguments, whereas in sad moods, people are persuaded only by strong arguments and reject weak arguments.&quot; Said otherwise, positive moods encourage easy acceptance of arguments, while negative moods encourage the changing of beliefs due to significant data.

Referring to the work of Marcus, political scientist Tom Brader says that, &quot;by appealing to specific emotions, [communicators] can change the way citizens respond to political messages&quot;.

==Influence of emotion on persuasion==
===Negative emotions===
====Fear and anxiety====
The only widely studied emotion, with respect to persuasion, is fear. Fear has been found to force individuals &quot;to break from routine and pay close attention to the external world,&quot; including persuasive messages. Moreover, fear has been found to encourage political engagement:
::&quot;people are demonstrably more likely to engage in the political realm when they are anxious about the candidates. Uneasiness about the available political choices leads people to pay closer attention to the political environment. [...] people learn more about the candidates (that is they acquire new and accurate knowledge) when they are anxious but not when they are enthusiastic about those candidates who dominate the political field.&quot;

More generally, &quot;fear is associated with both attitude and behavior change.&quot; However, &quot;four variables that may interact to influence processing depth of a fear-inducing message: (a) type of fear (chronic vs. acute), (b) expectation of a message containing reassuring information, (c) type of behavior advocated (e.g., disease detection vs. health promotion), and (d) issue familiarity.&quot;

====Guilt====
Guilt is the emotion that is experienced when an individual violates an internalized moral, ethical or religious belief. Guilt&#x27;s effect on persuasion has been studied only cursorily. Not unlike fear appeals, the literature suggests that guilt can enhance attainment of persuasive goals if evoked to a moderate degree. However, messages designed to evoke excessive levels of guilt may instead arouse anger that may impede persuasive success.

====Anger====
Anger&#x27;s effect on persuasion has also seldom been studied. A couple of studies, however, &quot;suggest that a positive relationship exists between anger and attitude change&quot;. Specifically, researchers found that &quot;anger evoked in response to issues of juvenile crime and domestic terrorism correlated with acceptance of legislative initiatives proposed to address those issues&quot;. Not unlike fear, anger was associated with close (central) information processing including of persuasive messages. However, &quot;unintentionally induced anger in response to supposed guilt and fear appeals has been shown to correlate negatively with attitudes&quot;. The persuasive uses of anger have also been studied in political campaigns, since anger can be evoked strategically by politicians to increase the motivation and engagement of their sympathizers, although the historian Nicole Hemmer has noted that the potential for an American candidate to use anger effectively is contingent on their identity.

====Sadness====
Sadness arousal has been associated with attitude change in the context of AIDS, illicit drugs, and juvenile crime.

====Disgust====
Disgust, in the context of messages opposing animal experimentation, is correlated negatively with attitude change. This is consistent with the idea that disgust results in a rejection of its source.

===Positive emotions===
====Empathy and compassion====
A number of recent studies support the role of compassion in skewing moral judgment. The researchers&#x27; findings show there is a major relationship between moral judgment and empathic concern in particular, specifically feelings of warmth and compassion in response to someone in distress.

Images of suffering children are the ideal triggers of this instinctive compassion.

Once triggered, compassion causes individuals to favor the few they see suffering over the many who they know to be suffering but in the abstract: &quot;People who feel similar to another person in need have been shown to experience more empathic compassion for that person than do those not manipulated to feel similar to another.&quot;

Dan Ariely notes that appeals that, through visual cues or otherwise, make us focus on specific, individual victims affect our attitudes and cause us to take action whereas, &quot;when many people are involved, we don&#x27;t. A cold calculation does not increase our concern for large problems; instead, it suppresses our compassion.&quot;

::&quot;In many ways, it is very sad that the only effective way to get people to respond to suffering is through an emotional appeal, rather than through an objective reading of massive need. The upside is that when our emotions are awakened, we can be tremendously caring. Once we attach an individual face to suffering, we&#x27;re much more willing to help, and we go far beyond what economists would expect from rational, selfish, maximizing agents.&quot; Empathy also influences our prosocial behaviors. Prosocial behaviors are actions that are concerned with helping others. For example, people are much more likely to donate money to find a cure for a disease when they know someone personally who has that illness. The empathy and compassion that we feel towards that person is what encourages us to donate. An empathy study was conducted by Fowler, Law, and Gaesser. The goal of this study was to determine how the empathy we feel varies throughout different people in our lives. Participants were asked to make a list of one hundred people. The people at the top of the list were parents, family, loved ones, etc. Towards the bottom of the list were strangers. Participants were then asked to imagine these people in various scenarios and describe the degree of empathy that they had towards each person. Results showed that the closer a person was the more empathy they felt, and for those at the bottom of the list there was not much empathy felt in comparison. 

====Pride====
&quot;Little studied in the social influence context, the one clearly identifiable study of pride and persuasion considered the role of culture in response to advertising, finding that members of a collectivist culture (China) responded more favorably to a pride-based appeal, whereas members of an individualist culture (the United States) responded more favorably to an empathy-based appeal.&quot;

====Relief====
Some researchers have argued that anxiety which is followed by relief results in greater compliance to a request than fear, because the relief causes a temporary state of disorientation, leaving individuals vulnerable to suggestion. The suggestion is that relief-based persuasion is a function of less careful information processing.

====Hope====
Experiments have shown that appeals to hope are successful mainly with subjects who self-report as being predisposed to experiencing fear. While hope is often seen and understood as an abstract concept, Adrienne Martin proves otherwise in their book How We Hope. In this book it is explained how hope is a two-part emotion. First, we feel hope, then we experience it. For example, when we have a desired goal, we hope that we can reach it, but that hope is what motivates us as individuals to work towards that goal. Hope also changes how we perceive others. Martin explains how once we can relate to someone, we are then feeling some degree of hope for them: hope for success, change or growth.

<text>Michael Z. Land (born 1961) is an American video game composer and musician best known for his scores for various games produced by LucasArts.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Michael Land was born in the North Shore area north of Boston, Massachusetts. His parents enrolled him in classical piano lessons when he was five, and he continued in these until he chose to stop out of frustration at age twelve. He started to play the electric bass guitar a couple of years later. He focused more on improvisation, and he played with several bands throughout high school.

In 1979, Land enrolled in the music program at Harvard University, where he concentrated on electronic music. He also rekindled his interest in classical music, particularly that of Ludwig van Beethoven. After graduation, he entered Mills College in Oakland, California to further study electronic music. He broadened his study to Renaissance polyphony, and he also studied computer programming.

When Land graduated from Mills in 1987, he took a job as a digital technician at an audio signal processor manufacturer called Lexicon. Land worked for the company for three years, a period he spent honing his programming skills and writing operating system software for the company&#x27;s MIDI remote controllers.

===Career with LucasArts===
By 1990, the home video game market was beginning to blossom, particularly for personal computers. In April of that year, Land obtained a job at the fledgeling Lucasfilm Games (today known as LucasArts), a software company owned by &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas. Land became the first in-house audio programmer and musician at the company, which had mostly outsourced its sound production duties to third-party developer Realtime Associates in the previous few years. Land&#x27;s first project with LucasArts was &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;. The soundtrack of the game gave the composer a chance to show his flexibility, as it is almost entirely made up of Caribbean-flavored themes, something different from anything Land had composed before. His music from &quot;Monkey Island&quot; has been performed live by a full orchestra at the Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2004. The event took place in Leipzig, Germany.

The sound engine used in &quot;Monkey Island&quot; bothered Land, however. He found it nearly impossible to synchronize music with action in the game. Land began work on LucasArts&#x27; iMUSE interactive music system to solve this problem. The project was more daunting than Land had anticipated, so he brought in his friend, Peter McConnell, to help. The two designed the iMUSE system as an advanced MIDI sequencer, but over the years, it has come to be, as Land describes it, &quot;a methodology&quot; that allows game producers greater control over in-game music, transitions, etc. Land also headed the company sound department, and since he was preoccupied with iMUSE, he hired another friend to the company, Clint Bajakian, to take over some composing projects.

With iMUSE completed, Land returned to work as composer. He worked on several titles, including more &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games and various projects based on Lucasfilm properties.

Land continues to widen his repertoire, and he is currently studying classical cello and violin. He plans to release an album of music he has written outside of LucasArts sometime in the future.

Michael Land also worked on the Telltale installment of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, and reprises his role in the new Return to Monkey Island with Clint Bajakian and Peter McConnell.

==Musical style and influences==
During his teen-age years, Land consciously studied and emulated the styles of performers such as Yes, the Grateful Dead, and Jimi Hendrix. To this day, he cites Hendrix&#x27;s mellow style as a great influence on his own music, and he claims that the Dead&#x27;s style is deeply rooted in his own work.

In his adult years, he also studied classical composers, particularly Beethoven, a composer whose accomplishments he describes as &quot;a mountain in the distance … no matter how much ground you cover, it&#x27;s always just as far away.&quot; He also developed an interest in Renaissance polyphony.

Land&#x27;s work shows great variation, a common trait for video game composers. He begins each project by reading over production notes for the game and then deciding on a musical style with the game&#x27;s producers. Once this is decided, Land listens to different examples of that style. His soundtracks are as varied as the games they accompany. The music of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series is Caribbean in style, tunes performed on light woodwinds and marimbas. On the other hand, his soundtrack for &quot;The Dig&quot; is cinematic, with dark, brooding themes played out slowly. Land himself cites &quot;The Dig&quot; score as the work that comes closest to his own personal style. Another trait Land has in common with other video game composers is his ability to compose music that remains listenable when played on a continuous loop.

Land&#x27;s music also tends to be more ambient in style. This allows him to compose fairly complex pieces but to keep them from being obtrusive to gameplay or spoken dialogue. Each project tends to feature at least a few louder, more melodic pieces, however, usually in the title theme and end credits.

Land&#x27;s work on &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; soundtrack simultaneously marks a compositional coming-of-age, and the advent of digital audio compression meaning that MIDI audio of the past could be replaced with hi-fidelity live audio and live voice recording. This allowed for Land to record the soundtrack with real instruments or high quality patches, which added a warmth and emotion to the music not present in earlier MIDI music.

Land&#x27;s skills as a composer and arranger are no more evident than in his choice of timbre; bringing together European folk and classical instruments with Caribbean and Central American instruments, weaving a texture that combines steel-pans, accordions, and afro-Cuban percussion amongst others. On one hand, heavily influenced by European nationalist music and nautical shanties and horn pipes, and on the other incorporating Caribbean and Brazilian styles.

<doc id="219724" wikidata="Q3550709" url="?curid=219724" title="United Mine Workers of America">
<text>The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union best known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada. Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care. By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners. The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. However it was responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.

The UMW was founded in Columbus, Ohio, on January 25, 1890, with the merger of two old labor groups, the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive Miners Union. Adopting the model of the union was initially established as a three-pronged labor tool: to develop mine safety; to improve mine workers&#x27; independence from the mine owners and the company store; and to provide miners with collective bargaining power.

After passage of the National Recovery Act in 1933 during the Great Depression, organizers spread throughout the United States to organize all coal miners into labor unions. Under the powerful leadership of John L. Lewis, the UMW broke with the American Federation of Labor and set up its own federation, the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations). Its organizers fanned out to organize major industries, including automobiles, steel, electrical equipment, rubber, paint and chemical, and fought a series of battles with the AFL. The UMW grew to 800,000 members and was an element in the New Deal Coalition supporting Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 and left the CIO, leaving the UMW increasingly isolated in the labor movement. During World War II the UMW was involved in a series of major strikes and threatened walkouts that angered public opinion and energized pro-business opponents. After the war, the UMW concentrated on gaining large increases in wages, medical services and retirement benefits for its shrinking membership, which was contending with changes in technology and declining mines in the East.

==Coal mining==
==Development of the Union==
The UMW was founded at Columbus City Hall in Columbus, Ohio, on January 25, 1890, by the merger of two earlier groups, the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive Miners Union. It was modeled after the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The Union&#x27;s emergence in the 1890s was the culmination of decades of effort to organize mine workers and people in adjacent occupations into a single, effective negotiating unit. At the time coal was one of the most highly sought natural resources, as it was widely used to heat homes and to power machines in industries. The coal mines were a competitive and dangerous place to work. With the owners imposing reduced wages on a regular basis, in response to fluctuations in pricing, miners sought a group to stand up for their rights.

===Early efforts===
American Miners&#x27; Association

The first step in starting the union was the creation of the American Miners&#x27; Association. Scholars credit this organization with the beginning of the labor movement in the United States. The membership of the group grew rapidly. &quot;Of an estimated 56,000 miners in 1865, John Hinchcliffe claimed 22,000 as members of the AMA. In response, the mine owners sought to stop the AMA from becoming more powerful. Members of the AMA were fired and blacklisted from employment at other mines. After a short time the AMA began to decline, and eventually ceased operations.

Workingman&#x27;s Benevolent Association

Another early labor union that arose in 1868 was the Workingmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association. This union was distinguished as a labor union for workers mining anthracite coal. The laborers formed the WBA to help improve pay and working conditions. The main reason for the success of this group was the president, John Siney, who sought a way both to increase miners benefits while also helping the operators earn a profit. They chose to limit the production of anthracite to keep its price profitable. Because the efforts of the WBA benefited the operators, they did not object when the union wanted to take action in the mines; they welcomed the actions that would secure their profit. Because the operators trusted the WBA, they agreed to the first written contract between miners and operators. As the union became more responsible in the operators&#x27; eyes, the union was given more freedoms. As a result, the health and spirits of the miners significantly improved.

The WBA could have been a very successful union had it not been for Franklin B. Gowen. In the 1870s Gowen lead the Reading Railroad, and bought several coal mines in the area. Because he owned the coal mines and controlled the means of transporting the coal, he was able to slowly destroy the labor union. He did everything in his power to produce the cheapest product and to ensure that non-union workers would benefit. As conditions for the miners of the WBA worsened, the union broke up and disappeared.

After the fall of the WBA, miners created many other small unions, including the Workingman&#x27;s Protective Association (WPA) and the Miner&#x27;s National Association (MNA). Although both groups had strong ideas and goals, they were unable to gain enough support and organization to succeed. The two unions did not last long, but provided greater support by the miners for a union which could withstand and help protect the workers&#x27; rights.

===1870s===
Although many labor unions were failing, two predominant unions arose that held promise to become strong and permanent advocates for the miners. The main problem during this time was the rivalry between the two groups. Because the National Trade Assembly #135, better known as the Knights of Labor, and the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers were so opposed to one another, they created problems for miners rather than solving key issues.

====National Trade Assembly #135====

This union was more commonly known as the Knights of Labor and began around 1870 in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area. The main problem with the Knights of Labor was its secrecy. The members kept very private their affiliation and goals of the Knights of Labor. Because both miners and operators could become members, there was no commonality to unite the members. Also, the union did not see strikes as a means to attain rights. To many people of the time, a strike was the only way that they believed they would be heard.

The Knights of Labor tried to establish a strong and organized union, so they set up a system of local assemblies, or LAs. There were two main types of LAs, trade and mixed, with the trade LA being the most common. Although this system was put into place to create order, it did the opposite. Even though there were only two categories of LAs, there were many sub-divisions. For the most part it was impossible to tell how many trade and mixed LAs there were at a given time. Local assemblies began to arise and fall all around, and many members began to question whether or not the Knights of Labor was strong enough to fight for the most important issue of the time, achieving an eight-hour work day.

====National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers====
This Union was formed by members of the Knights of Labor who realized that a secret and unified group would not turn into a successful union. The founders, John McBride, Chris Evans and Daniel McLaughlin, believed that creating an eight-hour work day would not only be beneficial for workers, but also as a means to stop overproduction, which would in turn help operators. The union was able to get cooperation from operators because they explained that the miners wanted better conditions because they felt as if they were part of the mining industry and also wanted the company to grow. But in order for the company to grow, the workers must have better conditions so that their labor could improve and benefit the operators.

The union&#x27;s first priority was to get a fair weighing system within the mines. At a conference between the operators and the union, the idea of a new system of scaling was agreed upon, but the system was never implemented. Because the union did not deliver what it had promised, it lost support and members.

===1880s===
During this time, the rivalry between the two unions increased and eventually led to the formation of the UMW. The first of many arguments arose after the 1886 joint conference. The Knights of Labor did not want the NTA #135 to be in control, so they went against a lot of their decisions. Also, because the Knights of Labor were not in attendance at the conference, they were not able to vote against actions which they thought detrimental to gain rights for workers. The conference passed resolutions requiring the Knights of Labor to give up their secrecy and publicize material about its members and locations. The National Federation held another conference in 1887 attended by both groups. But it was unsuccessful in gaining agreement by the groups as to the next actions to take. In 1888, Samuel Gompers was elected as President of the National Federation of Miners, and George Harris first vice president.

Throughout 1887–1888 many joint conferences were held to help iron out the problems that the two groups were having. Many leaders of each groups began questioning the morals of the other union. One leader, William T. Lewis, thought there needed to be more unity within the union, and that competition for members between the two groups was not accomplishing anything. As a result of taking this position, he was replaced by John B. Rae as president of the NTA #135. This removal did not stop Lewis however; he got many people together who had been also thrown out of the Knights of Labor for trying to belong to both parties at once, along with the National Federation, and created the National Progressive Union of Miners and Mine Laborers (NPU).

Although the goal of the NPU in 1888 was ostensibly to create unity between the miners, it instead drew a stronger line distinguishing members of the NPU against those of the NTA #135. Because of the rivalry, miners of one labor union would not support the strikes of another, and many strikes failed. In December 1889, the president of the NPU set up a joint conference for all miners. John McBride, the president of NPU, suggested that the Knights of Labor should join the NPU to form a stronger union. John B. Rae reluctantly agreed and decided that the merged groups would meet on January 22, 1890.

===Constitution of the Union: The Eleven Points===
When the union was founded, the values of the UMWA were stated in the preamble:

We have founded the United Mine Workers of America for the purpose of ... educating all mine workers in America to realize the necessity of unity of action and purpose, in demanding and securing by lawful means the just fruits of our toil.

The UMWA constitution listed eleven points as the union&#x27;s goals:
* Payment of a salary commensurate with the dangerous work conditions. This was one of the most important points of the constitution.
* Payment to be made fairly in legal tender, not with company scrip.
* Provide safe working conditions, with operators to use the latest technologies in order to preserve the lives and health of workers.
* Provide better ventilation systems to decrease black lung disease, and better drainage systems.
* Enforce safety laws and make it illegal for mines to have inadequate roof supports, or contaminated air and water in the mines.
* Limit regular hours to an eight-hour work day.
* End child labor, and strictly enforce the child labor law.
* Have accurate scales to weigh the coal products, so workers could be paid fairly. Many operators had altered scales that showed a lighter weight of coal than actually produced, resulting in underpayment to workers. Miners were paid per pound of coal that they produced.
* Payment should be made in legal tender.
* Establish unbiased public police forces in the mine areas that were not controlled by the operators. Many operators hired private police, who were used to harass the mine workers and impose company power. In company towns, the operators owned all the houses and controlled the police force; they could arbitrarily evict workers and arrest them unjustly.
* The workers reserved the right to strike, but would work with operators to reach reasonable conclusions to negotiations.

==John L. Lewis==
John L. Lewis (1880–1969) was the highly combative UMW president who thoroughly controlled the union from 1920 to 1960. A major player in the labor movement and national politics, in the 1930s he used UMW activists to organize new unions in autos, steel and rubber. He was the driving force behind the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). It established the United Steel Workers of America and helped organize millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s.

After resigning as head of the CIO in 1941, he took the Mine Workers out of the CIO in 1942 and in 1944 took the union into the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Lewis was a Republican, but he played a major role in helping Franklin D. Roosevelt win re-election with a landslide in 1936, but as an isolationist supported by Communist elements in the CIO, Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 on anti-Nazi foreign policy. (Following the 1939 German-Soviet pact of nonaggression, the Comintern had instructed communist parties in the West to oppose any support for nations at war with Nazi Germany.)

Lewis was an effective strike leader who gained high wages for his membership while suppressing his opponents, including the United States government. He was one of the most controversial and innovative leaders in the history of labor, gaining credit for building the industrial unions of the CIO into a political and economic powerhouse to rival the AFL, yet was widely criticized as he called nationwide coal strikes damaging the American economy in the middle of World War II. Coal miners for 40 years hailed him as the benevolent dictator who brought high wages, pensions and medical benefits.

==Achievements==
* An eight-hour work day was gained in 1898. The first ideas of this demand were outlined in point six of the constitution.
* The union achieved collective bargaining rights in 1933.
* Health and retirement benefits for the miners and their families were earned in 1946.
* In 1969, the UMWA convinced the United States Congress to enact the landmark Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, which provided compensation for miners suffering from Black Lung Disease.
* Relatively high wages for unionized miners by the early 1960s.

==List of strikes==
The union&#x27;s history has numerous examples of strikes in which members and their supporters clashed with company-hired strikebreakers and government forces. The most notable include:

===1890s===
* Morewood massacre – April 3, 1891, in Morewood, Pennsylvania. A crowd of mostly immigrant strikers were fired on by deputized members of the 10th Regiment of the National Guard. At least ten strikers were killed and dozens injured.
* Bituminous Coal Miners&#x27; Strike of 1894 – April 21, 1894. This nationwide strike was called when the union was hardly four years old. Many of the workers salaries had been cut by 30% and with the demand for coal down during the recession, workers were desperate for work. The national guard was mobilized in several states to prevent or control violent clashes between strikers and strike breakers. The workers intended to strike for three weeks, hoping that this would produce a demand for coal and their wages would increase with its rising price. But, many union miners did not wish to cooperate with this plan and did not return to work at all. The union appeared weak. Other workers did not go out on strike, and with the demand low, they were able to produce sufficient coal. By being efficient in the mines, the operators saw no need to increase the wages of all the workers, and did not seem to care if the strike would end.

By June the demand for coal began to increase, and some operators decided to pay the workers their original salaries before the wage cut. However, not all demands across the country were met, and some workers continued to strike. The young union suffered damage in this uneven effort. The most important goal of the 1894 strike was not the restoration of wages, but rather the establishment of the UMWA as a cooperation at a national level.
* Lattimer Massacre – September 10, 1897. 19 miners were killed by police in Lattimer, Pennsylvania, during a march in support of unions.
* Battle of Virden – October 1898. This was part of the larger mine wars that established Illinois as the leading union state in the country, and a reason that Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones is buried at Mount Olive, Illinois.

===Early 1900s===
* The five-month Coal Strike of 1902, led by the United Mine Workers and centered in eastern Pennsylvania, ended after direct intervention of President Theodore Roosevelt as a neutral arbitrator.
* 1903 Colorado coal strike – October 1903. The United Mine Workers conducted a strike in Colorado, called in October 1903 by President Mitchell, and lasting into 1904. The strike, while overshadowed by a simultaneous strike conducted by the Western Federation of Miners among hard rock miners in the Cripple Creek District, contributed to the labor struggles in Colorado. These came to be known as the Colorado Labor Wars. During the United Mine Workers effort, operators directed their private forces to attack and beat traveling union officers and organizers, which ultimately helped to break the strike. These beatings were a mystery until publication of &quot;The Pinkerton Labor Spy&quot; (1907) by Morris Friedman, which revealed that the UMWA had been infiltrated by labor spies from the Pinkerton agency.
* 1908 Alabama coal strike – June–August 1908. Notable because the 18,000 UMWA-organized strikers, more than half of those working in the Birmingham District, were racially integrated. That fact helped galvanize political opposition to the strikers in the segregated state. The governor used the Alabama State Militia to end the work stoppage. The union adopted racial segregation of workers in Alabama in order to reduce the political threat to the organization.
* Westmoreland County Coal Strike – 1910–1911, a 16-month coal strike in Pennsylvania led largely by Slovak immigrant miners, this strike involved 15,000 coal miners. Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.
* Colorado Coalfield War – September 1913–December 1914. A frequently violent strike against the John D. Rockefeller Jr.-Colorado Fuel and Iron company. Many strikers and opposition were killed before the violent reached a peak following the April 20, 1914 Ludlow Massacre. An estimated 20 people, including women and children, were killed by armed police, hired guns, and Colorado National Guardsmen who broke up a tent colony formed by families of miners who had been evicted from company-owned housing. The strike was partially led by John R. Lawson, a UMWA organizer and saw the participation of famed activist Mother Jones. The UMWA purchased part of Ludlow site and constructed the Ludlow Monument in commemoration of those who died.
* Hartford coal mine riot – July 1914. The surface plant of the Prairie Creek coal mine was destroyed, and two non-union miners murdered by union miners and sympathizers. The mine owners sued the local and national organizations of the United Mine Workers Union. The national UMWA was found not complicit, but the local was judged culpable of encouraging the rioters, and made to pay US$2.1 million.

* United Mine Workers coal strike of 1919 – November 1, 1919. Some 400,000 members of the United Mine Workers went on strike on November 1, 1919, although Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure criminalizing interference with the production or transportation of necessities, and obtained an injunction against the strike on October 31. The coal operators smeared the strikers with charges that Russian communist leaders Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press repeated those claims.
* Matewan, West Virginia – May 19, 1920. 12 men were killed in a gunfight between town residents and the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency, hired by mine owners. Director John Sayles directed a feature film, &quot;Matewan&quot;, based on these events.
* The &#x27;Redneck War&#x27; – 1920–21. Generally viewed as beginning with the Matewan Massacre, this conflict involved the struggle to unionize the southwestern area of West Virginia. It led to the march of 10,000 armed miners on the county seat at Logan. In the Battle of Blair Mountain, miners fought state militia, local police, and mine guards. These events are depicted in the novels &quot;Storming Heaven&quot; (1987) by Denise Giardina and &quot;Blair Mountain&quot; (2005) by Jonathan Lynn.
* 1920 Alabama coal strike, a lengthy, violent, expensive and fruitless attempt to achieve union recognition in the coal mines around Birmingham left 16 men dead; one black man was lynched.
*1922 UMW General coal strike, On April 1, 1922, 610,000 mine workers struck nationwide, shutting down the majority of operations within the country.
* Herrin massacre occurred in June 1922 in Herrin, Illinois. 19 strikebreakers and 3 union miners were killed in mob action between June 21–22, 1922.

===1922–1925 Nova Scotia strikes===
In the 1920s, about 12,000 Nova Scotia miners were represented by the UMWA. These workers lived in very difficult economic circumstances in company towns. The Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, also known as the British Empire Steel Corporation, or BESCO, controlled most coal mines and every steel mill in the province. BESCO was in financial difficulties and repeatedly attempted to reduce wages and bust the union.

Led by J. B. McLachlan, miners struck in 1923, and were met by locally and provincially-deployed troops. This would eventually lead to the federal government introducing legislation limiting the civil use of troops.

In 1925 BESCO announced that it would not longer give credit at their company stores and that wages would be cut by 20%. The miners responded with a strike. This led to violence with company police firing on strikers, killing miner William Davis, as well as the looting and arson of company property.

This crisis led to the Nova Scotia government acting in 1937 to improve the rights of all wage earners, and these reforms served as a model across Canada, at both provincial and federal levels.

===The Brookside Strike===
In the summer of 1973, workers at the Duke Power-owned Eastover Mining Company&#x27;s Brookside Mine and Prep Plant in Harlan County, Kentucky, voted to join the union. Eastover management refused to sign the contract and the miners went on strike. Duke Power attempted to bring in replacement non-union workers or &quot;scabs&quot; but many were blocked from entering the mine by striking workers and their families on the picket line. Local judge F. Byrd Hogg was a coal operator himself and consistently ruled for Eastover. During much of the strike the mine workers&#x27; wives and children joined the picket lines. Many were arrested, some hit by baseball bats, shot at, and struck by cars. One striking miner, Lawrence Jones, was shot and killed by a Strikebreaker.

Three months after returning to work, the national UMWA contract expired. On November 12, 1974, 120,000 miners nationwide walked off the job. The nationwide strike was bloodless and a tentative contract was achieved three weeks later. This opened the mines and reactivated the railroad haulers in time for Christmas. These events are depicted in the documentary film &quot;Harlan County, USA&quot;.

===The Pittston strike===
The Pittston Coal strike of 1989-1990 began as a result of a withdrawal of the Pittston Coal Group also known as the Pittston Company from the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) and a refusal of the Pittston Coal group to pay the health insurance payments for miners who were already retired. The owner of the Pittston company at the time, Paul Douglas, left the BCOA because he wanted to be able to produce coal seven days a week and did not want his company to pay the fee for the insurance.

The Pittson company was seen as having inadequate safety standards after the Buffalo Creek flood of 1972 in which 125 people were killed. The company also was very financially unstable and in debt. The mines associated with the company were located mostly in Virginia, with mines also in West Virginia and Kentucky.

On 31 January 1988 Douglas cut off retirement and health care funds to about 1500 retired miners, widows of miners, and disabled miners. To avoid a strike, Douglas threatened that if a strike were to take place, that the miners would be replaced by other workers. The UMW called this action unjust and took the Pittston company to court.

Miners worked from January 1988 to April 1989 without a contract. Tension in the company grew and on April 5, 1989, the workers declared a strike. Many months of both violent and nonviolent strike actions took place. On 20 February 1990 a settlement was finally reached between the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company.

==Internal conflict==
The union&#x27;s history has sometimes been marked by internal strife and corruption, including the 1969 murder of Joseph Yablonski, a reform candidate who lost a race for union president against incumbent W. A. Boyle, along with his wife and 25-year-old daughter. Boyle was later convicted of ordering these murders.

The killing of Yablonski resulted in the birth of a pro-democracy movement called the &quot;Miners for Democracy&quot; (MFD) which swept Boyle and his regime out of office, and replaced them with a group of leaders who had been most recently rank and file miners.

Led by new president Arnold Miller, the new leadership enacted a series of reforms which gave UMWA members the right to elect their leaders at all levels of the union and to ratify the contracts under which they worked.

==Decline of labor unionism in mining==
Decreased faith in the UMW to support the rights of the miners caused many to leave the union. Coal demand was curbed by competition from other energy sources. The main cause of the decline in the union during the 1920s and 1930s was the introduction of more efficient and easily produced machines into the coal mines. In previous years, less than 41% of coal was cut by the machines. However, by 1930, 81% was being cut by the machines and now there were machines that could also surface mine and load the coal into the trucks. With more machines that could do the same labor, unemployment in the mines grew and wages were cut back. As the problems grew, many people did not believe that the UMW could ever
become as powerful as it was before the start of the war. The decline in the union began in the 1920s and continued through the 1930s. Slowly the membership of the UMWA grew back up in numbers, with the majority in District 50, a catch-all district for workers in fields related to coal mining, such as the chemical and energy industries. This district gained organizational independence in 1961, and then fell into dispute with the remainder of the union, leading in 1968 to its expulsion.

===In the 1970s and after===
Diana Baldwin and Anita Cherry, hired as miners in 1973, are believed to have been the first women to work in an underground coal mine in the United States. They were the first female members of UMWA to work inside a mine. Cherry and Baldwin were hired by the Beth-Elkhorn Coal Company in Jenkins, Kentucky. However, more pervasive were hiring practices discriminatory against women. The superstition that a woman even entering a mine was bad luck and resulted in disaster was pervasive among male miners.

In 1978 a discrimination complaint was filed by the Coal Employment Project, a women&#x27;s advocacy organization, against 153 coal companies. This action was based upon Executive Order 11246 signed in 1965 by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, which bars sex discrimination by companies with federal contracts. The complaint called for the hiring of one woman for every three inexperienced men until women constituted 20 percent of the workforce. This legal strategy was successful. Almost 3,000 women were hired by the close of 1979 as underground miners.
A general decline in union effectiveness characterized the 1970s and 1980s, leading to new kinds of activism, particularly in the late 1970s. Workers saw their unions back down in the face of aggressive management.

Other factors contributed to the decline in unionism generally and UMW specifically. The coal industry was not prepared economically to deal with such a drop in demand for coal. Demand for coal was very high during World War II, but decreased dramatically after the war, in part due to competition from other energy sources. In efforts to improve air quality, municipal governments started to ban the use of coal as household fuel. The end of wartime price controls introduced competition to produce cheaper coal, putting pressure on wages.

These problems—perceived weakness of the unions, loss of control over jobs, drop in demand, and competition—decreased the faith of miners in their union.
By 1998 the UMW had about 240,000 members, half the number that it had in 1946. As of the early 2000s, the union represents about 42 percent of all employed miners.

==Affiliation with other unions==
At some point before 1930, the UMW became a member of the American Federation of Labor. The UMW leadership was part of the driving force to change the way workers were organized, and the UMW was one of the charter members when the new Congress of Industrial Organizations was formed in 1935. However, the AFL leadership did not agree with the philosophy of industrial unionization, and the UMW and nine other unions that had formed the CIO were kicked out of the AFL in 1937.

In 1942, the UMW chose to leave the CIO, and, for the next five years, were an independent union. In 1947, the UMW once again joined the AFL, but the remarriage was a short one, as the UMW was forced out of the AFL in 1948, and at that point, became the largest non-affiliated union in the United States.

In 1982, Richard Trumka was elected the leader of the UMW. Trumka spent the 1980s healing the rift between the UMW and the now-conjoined AFL–CIO (which was created in 1955 with the merger of the AFL and the CIO). In 1989, the UMW was again taken into the fold of the large union umbrella.

==Political involvement==

Throughout the years, the UMW has taken political stands and supported candidates to help achieve union goals.

The United Mine Workers ran candidate Frank Henry Sherman under the union banner in the 1905 Alberta general election. Sherman&#x27;s candidacy was driven to appeal to the significant population of miners working in the camps of southern Alberta. He finished second in the riding of Pincher Creek.

The biggest conflict between the UMW and the government was while Franklin Roosevelt was president of the United States and John L. Lewis was president of the UMW. Originally, the two worked together well, but, after the 1937 strike of United Automobile Workers against General Motors, Lewis stopped trusting Roosevelt, claiming that Roosevelt had gone back on his word. This conflict led Lewis to resign as CIO president. Roosevelt repeatedly won large majorities of the union votes, even in 1940 when Lewis took an isolationist position on Europe, as demanded by far-left union elements. Lewis denounced Roosevelt as a power-hungry war monger, and endorsed Republican Wendell Willkie.

The tension between the two leaders escalated during World War II. Roosevelt in 1943 was outraged when Lewis threatened a major strike to end anthracite coal production needed by the war effort. He threatened government intervention and Lewis retreated.

The UMW represents West Virginia coal miners and endorsed Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in the 2018 United States Senate election in West Virginia. In 2021 the union urged him to revisit his opposition to President Biden&#x27;s Build Back Better Plan, noting that the bill includes an extension of a fund that provides benefits to coal miners suffering from black lung disease, which expires at the end of the year. The UMWA also touted tax incentives that encourage manufacturers to build facilities in coalfields that would employ thousands of miners who lost their jobs.

===Recent elections===
In 2008 the UMWA supported Barack Obama as the best candidate to help achieve more rights for the mine workers.

In 2012, the UMWA National COMPAC Council did not make an endorsement in the election for President of the United States, citing &quot;Neither candidate has yet demonstrated that he will be on the side of UMWA members and their families as president.&quot;

In 2014, the UMWA endorsed Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes for U.S. Senate.

In 2023, the UMWA endorsed Democrat Andy Beshear for the 2023 Kentucky gubernatorial election.

<doc id="219730" wikidata="Q173287" url="?curid=219730" title="Acrostic">
<text>An acrostic is a poem or other word composition in which the &quot;first&quot; letter (or syllable, or word) of each new line (or paragraph, or other recurring feature in the text) spells out a word, message or the alphabet. The term comes from the French from post-classical Latin , from Koine Greek , from Ancient Greek &quot;highest, topmost&quot; and &quot;verse&quot;. As a form of constrained writing, an acrostic can be used as a mnemonic device to aid memory retrieval. When the &quot;last&quot; letter of each new line (or other recurring feature) forms a word it is called a telestich (or telestic); the combination of an acrostic and a telestich in the same composition is called a double acrostic (e.g. the first-century Latin Sator Square).

Acrostics are common in medieval literature, where they usually serve to highlight the name of the poet or his patron, or to make a prayer to a saint. They are most frequent in verse works but can also appear in prose. The Middle High German poet Rudolf von Ems for example opens all his great works with an acrostic of his name, and his world chronicle marks the beginning of each age with an acrostic of the key figure (Moses, David, etc.). In chronicles, acrostics are common in German and English but rare in other languages.

== Form ==
Relatively simple acrostics may merely spell out the letters of the alphabet in order; such an acrostic may be called an &#x27;alphabetical acrostic&#x27; or abecedarius. These acrostics occur in the Hebrew Bible in the first four of the five chapters of the Book of Lamentations, in the praise of the good wife in Proverbs 31:10-31, and in Psalms 9-10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119 and 145.
Notable among the acrostic Psalms is the long Psalm 119, which typically is printed in subsections named after the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, each section consisting of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire psalm consisting of 22 x 8 = 176 verses; and Psalm 145, which is recited three times a day in the Jewish services. Some acrostic psalms are technically imperfect. For example, Psalm 9 and Psalm 10 appear to constitute a single acrostic psalm together, but the length assigned to each letter is unequal and five of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are not represented and the sequence of two letters is reversed. In Psalm 25 one Hebrew letter is not represented, the following letter () repeated. In Psalm 34 the current final verse, 23, does fit verse 22 in content, but adds an additional line to the poem. In Psalms 37 and 111 the numbering of verses and the division into lines are interfering with each other; as a result in Psalm 37, for the letters and there is only one verse, and the letter is not represented. Psalm 111 and 112 have 22 lines, but 10 verses. Psalm 145 does not represent the letter , having 21 one verses, but one Qumran manuscript of this Psalm does have that missing line, which agrees with the Septuagint. Some, like O Palmer Robertson, see the acrostic Psalms of book 1 and book 5 of Psalms as teaching and memory devices as well as transitions between subjects in the structure of the Psalms. 

Often the ease of detectability of an acrostic can depend on the intention of its creator. In some cases an author may desire an acrostic to have a better chance of being perceived by an observant reader, such as the acrostic contained in the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; (where the key capital letters are decorated with ornate embellishments). However, acrostics may also be used as a form of steganography, where the author seeks to conceal the message rather than proclaim it. This might be achieved by making the key letters uniform in appearance with the surrounding text, or by aligning the words in such a way that the relationship between the key letters is less obvious. These are referred to as &quot;null ciphers&quot; in steganography, using the first letter of each word to form a hidden message in an otherwise innocuous text. Using letters to hide a message, as in acrostic ciphers, was popular during the Renaissance, and could employ various methods of enciphering, such as selecting other letters than initials based on a repeating pattern (equidistant letter sequences), or even concealing the message by starting at the end of the text and working backwards.

==Examples==
===Greek===

A well-known acrostic in Greek is for the phrase &quot;JESUS CHRIST, GOD’S SON, SAVIOUR&quot;, the initial letters of which spell (ICHTHYS), which means &quot;fish&quot;:
 Ιησοῦς I Jesus
 Χριστός CH Christ
 Θεοῦ TH God&#x27;s
 Υἱός Y Son
 Σωτήρ S Saviour

According to Cicero, acrostics were a regular feature of Sibylline prophecies (which were written in Greek hexameters. The type of acrostic is that known as a “gamma acrostic” (from the shape of the Greek letter ), where the same words are found both horizontally and vertically. Cicero refers to an acrostic in this passage using the Greek word .

The 3rd-century BC didactic poet Aratus, who was much admired and imitated by Cicero, Virgil and other Latin writers, appears to have started a fashion for using acrostics. One example is the famous passage in &quot;Phaenomena&quot; 783–7 where the word occurs as a gamma acrostic and also twice in the text, as well as diagonally in the text and even cryptically taking the initial letters of certain words in lines 2 and 1: 
:
:

:
:

:“If (the moon is) slender and clear about the third day,
:she will bode fair weather; if slender and very red,
:wind; if the crescent is thickish, with blunted horns,
:having a feeble fourth-day light after the third day,
:either it is blurred by a southerly or because rain is in the offing.” (trans. Jerzy Danielewicz)

===Latin===
Several acrostics have recently been discovered in Roman poets, especially in Virgil. Among others, in &quot;Eclogue&quot; 9 the acrostic (lines 34–38) immediately precedes the words , and (i.e. ) (lines 46–51) in a passage which mentions the goddess Dione (another name for Venus). In &quot;Eclogue&quot; 8, alongside a passage dedicating the poem to an unnamed person and asking him to accept it, Neil Adkin reads the words (i.e. ) ().

In &quot;Aeneid&quot; 7.601–4, a passage which mentions Mars and war, describing the custom of opening the gates of the Temple of Janus, the name (the god of war) appears in acrostic form as well as in the text as follows:
:
:

:“It was a custom in Hesperian Latium, which originally the Alban
:cities kept as sacred, and now, greatest of entities,
:Rome keeps, whenever they move Mars to the first battles,
:whether (they are preparing) to bring tearful war to the Getae …”

In &quot;Georgics&quot; 1 429–433, next to a passage which contains the words , the double-letter reverse acrostic &quot;MA VE PV&quot; (i.e. Publius Vergilius Maro) is found on alternate lines.

In Eclogue 6, 13–24 Virgil uses a double acrostic, with the same word going both upwards and downwards starting from the same letter L in line 19. Another double acrostic is found in &quot;Aeneid 2&quot;, where the word &quot;PITHI&quot; (i.e. , Greek for he ‘persuades’ or ‘he deceives’) is found first backwards at 103–107, then forwards at 142–146, at the beginning and end of a speech by Sinon persuading the Trojans to bring the wooden horse into the city. The discoverer of this acrostic, Neil Adkin, points out that the same word occurs at more or less exactly the same line-numbers in a repeated line describing how Odysseus’ wife Penelope deceived the suitors in &quot;Odyssey&quot; 2.106 and 24.141. 

Another transliterated Greek word used as an acrostic in a pseudo-Sibylline prophecy has recently been noticed in the syllables &quot;DE CA TE&quot; (i.e. Greek ) in Eclogue 4, 9–11, with the same &quot;DEC A TE&quot; repeated cryptically both forwards and backwards in line 11.

In another pseudo-Sibylline prophecy in poem 5 of Tibullus book 2 the words ‘hear me!’ are picked out in the first letters of alternate lines at the beginning of the prophecy.

Virgil’s friend Horace also made occasional use of acrostics, but apparently much less than Virgil. Examples are ‘learn!’ (&quot;Odes&quot; 1.18.11–15) (forming a gamma acrostic with the word in line 18) and in &quot;Satires&quot; 1.2.7–10, which appears just after Horace has been advised to take a rest from writing satire. The acrostic also occurs in Ovid, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; 15.478–81, a passage describing the return of the peace-loving king Numa Pompilius to Rome. &quot;Odes&quot; 4.2, which starts with the word &#x27;(the poet) Pindar&#x27; has next to it the truncated acrostic PIN in a gamma formation. In the first poem of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epodes&quot; (which were also known as &#x27;iambics&#x27;), the first two lines begin , and it has been suggested that these words were deliberately chosen so that their initial letters IBI ... AM could be rearranged to read IAMBI.

Towards the end of the 2nd century AD a verse-summary of the plot was added to each of the plays of Plautus. Each of these has an acrostic of the name of the play, for example:
:
:
:

:“Two fellow slaves seek a fellow female slave as a wife;
:The old man commissions one of them, his son the other.
:A lottery helps the old man; but he is deceived by tricks.
:So, instead of the girl, a young slave is substituted,
:a naughty one, who beats up the master and the farm-manager.
:The young man marries Casina after she is recognised as a citizen.”

The 3rd century AD poet Commodian wrote a series of 80 short poems on Christian themes called . Each of these is fully acrostic (with the exception of poem 60, where the initial letters are in alphabetical order), starting with ‘preface’ and ‘the wrath of God’. The initials of poem 80, read backwards, give ‘Commodian, Christ’s beggar’.

===Mandaean===
Chapters 2–5 of Book 12 in the &quot;Right Ginza&quot;, a Mandaic text, are acrostic hymns, with each stanza ordered according to a letter of the Mandaic alphabet.

===Dutch===
There is an acrostic secreted in the Dutch national anthem &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; (&quot;William&quot;): the first letters of its fifteen stanzas spell WILLEM VAN NASSOV. This was one of the hereditary titles of William of Orange (William the Silent), who introduces himself in the poem to the Dutch people. This title also returned in the 2010 speech from the throne, during the Dutch State Opening of Parliament, whose first 15 lines also formed WILLEM VAN NASSOV.

===English===
Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s short story &quot;The Vane Sisters&quot; is known for its acrostic final paragraph, which contains a message from beyond the grave.

In 1829, Edgar Allan Poe wrote an acrostic and simply titled it &quot;An Acrostic&quot;, possibly dedicated to his cousin Elizabeth Rebecca Herring (though the initials L.E.L. refer to Letitia Elizabeth Landon):
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
Elizabeth it is in vain you say
&quot;Love not&quot; — thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe&#x27;s talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love — was cured of all beside —
His folly — pride — and passion — for he died.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1939 Rolfe Humphries received a lifelong ban from contributing to &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine after he penned and attempted to publish &quot;a poem containing a concealed scurrilous phrase aimed at a well-known person&quot;, namely Nicholas Murray Butler. The poem, entitled &quot;An ode for a Phi Beta Kappa affair&quot;, was in unrhymed iambic pentameter, contained one classical reference per line, and ran as follows:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
Niobe&#x27;s daughters yearn to the womb again,
Ionians bright and fair, to the chill stone;
Chaos in cry, Actaeon&#x27;s angry pack,
Hounds of Molossus, shaggy wolves driven

Over Ampsanctus&#x27; vale and Pentheus&#x27; glade,
Laelaps and Ladon, Dromas, Canace,
As these in fury harry brake and hill
So the great dogs of evil bay the world.

Memory, Mother of Muses, be resigned
Until King Saturn comes to rule again!
Remember now no more the golden day
Remember now no more the fading gold,
Astraea fled, Proserpina in hell;
You searchers of the earth be reconciled!

Because, through all the blight of human woe,
Under Robigo&#x27;s rust, and Clotho&#x27;s shears,
The mind of man still keeps its argosies,
Lacedaemonian Helen wakes her tower,

Echo replies, and lamentation loud
Reverberates from Thrace to Delos Isle;
Itylus grieves, for whom the nightingale
Sweetly as ever tunes her Daulian strain.
And over Tenedos the flagship burns.

How shall men loiter when the great moon shines
Opaque upon the sail, and Argive seas
Rear like blue dolphins their cerulean curves?
Samos is fallen, Lesbos streams with fire,
Etna in rage, Canopus cold in hate,
Summon the Orphic bard to stranger dreams.

And so for us who raise Athene&#x27;s torch.
Sufficient to her message in this hour:
Sons of Columbia, awake, arise!
&lt;/poem&gt;
Acrostic: Nicholas Murray Butler is a horse&#x27;s ass.

In October 2009, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a note to assemblyman Tom Ammiano in which the first letters of lines 3-9 spell &quot;Fuck You&quot;; Schwarzenegger claimed that the acrostic message was coincidental, which mathematicians Stephen Devlin and Philip Stark disputed as statistically implausible.

In January 2010, Jonathan I. Schwartz, the CEO of Sun Microsystems, sent an email to Sun employees on the completion of the acquisition of Sun by Oracle Corporation. The initial letters of the first seven paragraphs spelled &quot;Beat IBM&quot;.

James May, former presenter on the BBC program &quot;Top Gear&quot;, was fired from the publication &quot;Autocar&quot; for spelling out a message using the large red initial at the beginning of each review in the publication&#x27;s &quot;Road Test Yearbook Issue&quot; for 1992. Properly punctuated, the message reads: &quot;So you think it&#x27;s really good, yeah? You should try making the bloody thing up; it&#x27;s a real pain in the arse.&quot;

In the 2012 third novel of his &quot;Caged Flower&quot; series, author Cullman Wallace used acrostics as a plot device. The parents of a protagonist send e-mails where the first letters of the lines reveal their situation in a concealed message.

On 19 August 2017, the members of president Donald Trump&#x27;s Committee on Arts and Humanities resigned in protest over his response to the Unite the Right rally incident in Charlottesville, Virginia. The members&#x27; letter of resignation contained the acrostic &quot;RESIST&quot; formed from the first letter of each paragraph.

On 23 August 2017, University of California, Berkeley energy professor Daniel Kammen resigned from his position as a State Department science envoy with a resignation letter in which the word &quot;IMPEACH&quot; was spelled out by the first letters of each paragraph.

In the video game &quot;Zork&quot; the first letters of sentences in a prayer spelled &quot;Odysseus&quot; which was a possible solution to a Cyclops encounter in another room.

On 4 May 2024, Noelia Voigt resigned as Miss USA 2023 with a resignation letter containing an acrostic spelling out &quot;I am silenced&quot;.

== Multiple acrostics ==

===Double acrostics===

A double acrostic, may have words at the beginning and end of its lines, as in this example, on the name of Stroud, by Paul Hansford:
 S et among hills in the midst of five valley S,
 T his peaceful little market town we inhabi T
 R efuses (vociferously!) to be a conforme R.
 O nce home of the cloth it gave its name t O,
 U phill and down again its streets lead yo U.
 D espite its faults it leaves us all charme D.

The first letters make up the acrostic and the last letters the telestich; in this case they are identical.

Another example of a double acrostic is the first-century Latin Sator Square. 
As well as being a double acrostic, the square contains several palindromes, and it can be read as a 25-letter palindromic sentence (of an obscure meaning).

===Complex acrostics===

The poem &quot;Behold, O God!&quot;, by William Browne, can be considered a complex kind of acrostic. 
In the manuscript, some letters are capitalized and written extra-large, non-italic, and in red, and the lines are shifted left or right and internally spaced out as necessary to position the red letters within three crosses that extend through all the lines of the poem. 
The letters within each cross spell out a verse from the New Testament:
*left: Luke 23:42: &quot;Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&quot; 
*middle: Matthew 27:46: &quot;O God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; 
*right: Luke 23:39: &quot;If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.&quot;
The &quot;INRI&quot; at the top of the middle cross stands for &quot;,&quot; , Latin for &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews&quot; (). The three quotes represent the three figures crucified on Golgotha, as recorded in the gospels of Matthew and Luke.

(The text of the manuscript shown differs significantly from the text usually published, including in the reference. Many of the lines have somewhat different wording; and while the acrostics are the same as far as they go, the published text is missing the last four lines, truncating the acrostics to &quot;Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kin&quot;, &quot;O God, my God, why hast thou forsak&quot;, and &quot;If thou art the Christ, save thyself&quot;. The manuscript text is printed below, first as normal poetry, then spaced and bolded to bring out the acrostics. The word &quot;Thou&quot; in line 8 is not visible in this photograph, but is in the published version and is included in a cross-stitch sampler of the poem from 1793.)

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
Behold, O God! In rivers of my tears
I come to thee! bow down thy blessed ears
To hear my Plaint; and let thine eyes which keep
Continual watch behold a Sinner weep:
Let not, O God my God my Sins, tho&#x27; great,
And numberless, between thy Mercy&#x27;s-Seat
And my poor Soul have place; since we are taught,
&quot;[Thou]&quot; Lord, remember&#x27;st thyne, if Thou art sought.
I come not, Lord, with any other merit
Than what I by my Saviour Christ inherit:
Be then his wounds my balm— his stripes my Bliss;
His thorns my crown; my death be blest in his.
And thou, my blest Redeemer, Saviour, God,
Quit my accounts, withhold thy vengeful rod!
O beg for me, my hopes on Thee are set;
And Christ forgive me, since thou&#x27;st paid my debt
The living font, the Life, the Way, I know,
And but to thee, O whither shall I go?
All other helps are vain: grant thine to me,
For in thy cross my saving health I see.
O hearken then, that I with faith implore,
Lest Sin and Death sink me to rise no more.
Lastly, O God, my course direct and guide,
In Death defend me, that I never slide;
And at Doomsday let me be rais&#x27;d again,
To live with thee sweet Jesus say, Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

 Behold, O God! IN RI vers of my tears

<doc id="219731" wikidata="Q6497116" url="?curid=219731" title="Myst">
<text>Myst is an adventure video game designed by Rand and Robyn Miller. It was developed by Cyan, Inc., published by Broderbund, and first released in 1993 for the Macintosh. In the game, the player travels via a special book to a mysterious island called Myst. The player interacts with objects and traverses the environment by clicking on pre-rendered imagery. Solving puzzles allows the player to travel to other worlds (&quot;Ages&quot;), which reveal the backstory of the game&#x27;s characters and help the player make the choice of whom to aid.

The Miller brothers had started in game development creating black-and-white, largely plotless works aimed at children. They wanted &quot;Myst&quot; to be a graphically impressive game with a nonlinear story and mystery elements aimed at adults. The game&#x27;s design was limited by the small memory footprint of video game consoles and by the slow speed of CD-ROM drives. The game was created on Apple Macintosh computers and ran on the HyperCard software stack, though ports to other platforms subsequently required the creation of a new engine.

&quot;Myst&quot; was a critical and commercial success. Critics lauded the ability of the game to immerse players in its fictional worlds. It has been called one of the most influential and best video games ever made. Selling more than six million copies, &quot;Myst&quot; was the best-selling PC game for nearly a decade. The game helped drive adoption of the CD-ROM drive, spawned a multimedia franchise, and inspired clones, parodies, and new video game genres, as well as spin-off novels and other media. The game has been ported to multiple platforms and remade multiple times.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Myst&quot;″s gameplay consists of a first-person journey through an interactive world. Players can interact with specific objects on some screens by clicking or dragging them. The player moves by clicking on locations shown on the screen; the scene then crossfades into another frame, and the player can explore the new area. &quot;Myst&quot; has an optional &quot;Zip&quot; feature to assist in rapidly crossing areas already explored; when a lightning bolt cursor appears, players can click and skip several frames to another location. While this provides a rapid method of travel, it can also cause players to miss important items and clues. Some items can be carried by the player and read, including journal pages which provide backstory. Players can only carry a single page at a time, and pages return to their original locations when dropped.

To complete the game, the player must fully explore the island of Myst. There, the player discovers and follows clues to be transported via &quot;linking books&quot; to several &quot;Ages&quot;, each of which is a self-contained mini-world. Each of the Ages—named Selenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood—requires the user to solve a series of logical, interrelated puzzles to complete its exploration. Each Age must be explored to solve the game&#x27;s primary puzzle on Myst.

Apart from its predominantly nonverbal storytelling, &quot;Myst&quot;″s gameplay was unusual among adventure games in several ways. The player is provided with very little backstory at the beginning of the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. There are no obvious enemies, no physical violence, no time limit to complete the game, and no threat of dying at any point. The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.

==Plot==
Players assume the role of an unnamed person who stumbles across an unusual book titled &quot;Myst&quot;. The player reads the book and discovers a detailed description of an island world. Placing their hand on the last page, the player is transported to the world described and is left with no choice but to explore the island. In the island&#x27;s library, two books can be found, colored red and blue. These books are traps that hold Sirrus and Achenar, the sons of Atrus, who once lived on Myst island with his wife Catherine. Atrus writes special linking books that transport people to the Ages that the books describe. From the panels of their books, Sirrus and Achenar tell the player that Atrus is dead; each brother blames the other for the death of their family, as well as the destruction of much of Atrus&#x27; library. Both plead for help to escape. The books are missing several pages, rendering the sons&#x27; messages unclear and riddled with static.

As the player continues to explore the island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The player must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then be placed in the corresponding books. As the player adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers tell the player where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the player can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The player is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.

Sirrus and Achenar beg the player not to touch the green book located by their final pages, claiming it to be another trap book like their own. In truth, it leads to D&#x27;ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the player to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island. The game has several endings, depending on the player&#x27;s actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the player to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the prison book as the son rips the pages out. Linking to D&#x27;ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the player and Atrus trapped in D&#x27;ni. Bringing Atrus the page allows him to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon his return, Atrus returns to his writing and allows the player to explore Myst and its Ages at their leisure, while also asking them to be on hand to help in the future, as he was contending with a greater foe than his sons (setting the stage for &quot;Riven&quot;). Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.

==Development==
===Background===
In the late 1980s, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller were living apart in the United States. Robyn was taking a year off from university in Washington state, writing and trying to establish residency, while Rand worked in Texas as a computer programmer for a bank. Rand approached his brother with the idea of making an interactive storybook using HyperCard. The brothers were not big video game players themselves, although they were familiar with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and had played &quot;Zork&quot;. In his parents&#x27; basement—Robyn did not own a computer himself—Robyn began drawing pictures and creating a nonlinear story that would eventually become their first game, &quot;The Manhole&quot;. &quot;The Manhole&quot; and the games that followed—&quot;Cosmic Osmo&quot; and &quot;Spelunx&quot;—were specifically aimed at children and shared the same aesthetics: black-and-white graphics, point-and-click gameplay, a first-person point of view, and explorable worlds. Robyn recalled that the games were more about exploration than narrative: &quot;In the projects we did for children, we didn&#x27;t really tell stories ... They were just these worlds that you would explore.&quot;

Around 1990, the brothers decided to create a game that would appeal to adults. Among their goals were believable characters, a non-linear story, and for the player as protagonist to make ethical choices. The Millers pitched the game to Activision under the title &quot;The Gray Summons&quot;; Robyn recalled that Activision told them to stick to children&#x27;s games. At the time of the rejection, they were not doing well financially—&quot;we were eating rice and beans and government cheese and that [was] our diet.&quot; Facing the end of their game-producing career, Japanese developer Sunsoft approached the Millers to create an adult-oriented game. Like with &quot;The Gray Summons&quot;, the Millers wanted their game to have a non-linear story with believable characters and an ethical choice. They also wanted to produce a game with far more impressive graphics than their previous efforts, at one point considering an entirely hand-drawn game. They also knew their story would be a mystery.

Development of &quot;Myst&quot; began in 1991. The game&#x27;s creative team consisted of brothers Rand and Robyn, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall and Ryan Miller, who together made up Cyan, Inc. &quot;Myst&quot; was the largest and most time-consuming collaboration Cyan had attempted at that point. Cyan took inspiration from games like &quot;Zork&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;″ mythic universe, portals to other worlds like in C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, and the mysterious islands of old literature like the works of Jules Verne. The game&#x27;s name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; by Verne.

Sunsoft was not interested in the PC market and was focused on the video game console market instead. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game&#x27;s environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like they did not have to second-guess their choices and could &quot;explore the world as we were designing&quot; and build a game for themselves. Rand stated that they strived to design the puzzles in &quot;Myst&quot; and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. They wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: &quot;once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven&#x27;t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have.&quot;

The Millers prepared a seven-page game proposal for Sunsoft from their ideas, mostly consisting of maps of the islands they had envisioned. Cyan proposed &quot;Myst&quot; to Sunsoft for $265,000—more than double what they thought it would cost to develop the game, but ultimately less than the game&#x27;s final cost. Sunsoft had asked the brothers if their game would be as good as the upcoming &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, another CD-ROM video game that had been shown in public preview demonstrations; the Millers assured them it would. After getting the go-ahead, Cyan play-tested the entire game in a role-played &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; form to identify any large issues before entering full production.

===Production===

&quot;Myst&quot; was not only the largest project Cyan had attempted, but also took the longest to develop. The brothers spent months designing the look and puzzles of the Ages, which were influenced by earlier whimsical worlds made for children. Much of the early development time was spent devising puzzles and the Ages, and the story was secondary. &quot;We were place designers [...] and the maps kind of fueled the story,&quot; Rand said. The plot evolved in tandem with the changing environment, developing new story details with each new building in the world. They realized that the setting would require developing more story and history than the players would actually see. The climactic ending with Atrus was a later development in the game&#x27;s story, after Cyan realized they wanted to create a more complicated ending. In retrospect, Robyn felt that &quot;Myst&quot; did not quite provoke the emotional reaction and ethical quandary they set out to create.

The game was created on Macintosh computers, principally the Macintosh Quadra 700, using the HyperCard software. Cyan discovered using 3D rendering software was faster than the hand-drawn figures that they had used on their previous titles, and allowed the addition of color. The terrain for the Ages were created starting with grayscale heightmaps that were extruded to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap that was wrapped around the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design. Rand noted that attention to detail allowed &quot;Myst&quot; to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating: &quot;A lot can be done with texture ... Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things. These are the things you don&#x27;t necessarily notice, but if they weren&#x27;t there, would flag to your subconscious that this is fake.&quot; The environments were rendered in StrataVision 3D, with some additional modeling in Macromedia MacroModel, while Rand would place those images into HyperCard to link them up and test the puzzle aspects. Overall, &quot;Myst&quot; contains 2,500 frames, one for each possible area the player can explore. Some frames took hours to render, while others took days. The final images for the game were edited and enhanced using Photoshop 1.0.

When Cyan began development, developing believable characters was a major hurdle. The brothers were limited to one-way communication with the player, and at any point, a player could choose to walk away and &quot;break the spell&quot; of the game. Displaying video in the game was initially infeasible. Designing around the limits, the designers created the trap books, which were location-specific, one-way communication devices. The release of QuickTime halfway through development of the game solved the video issue.

The original HyperCard Macintosh version of &quot;Myst&quot; had each Age as a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, &quot;Myst&quot; functions as a series of separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. The main technical constraint that impacted &quot;Myst&quot; was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds—few consumers had anything faster than single-speed drives, limiting the speed of streaming data off the disc. Cyan had to go to great lengths to make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66 minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500 kB to around 80 kB. The Millers tried to place related scenes and files close together on the disc&#x27;s spiral track to reduce the seek time and in-game delay as the player transitions from scene to scene.

Cyan play-tested the game with two people sitting in front of the game, finding that they would converse with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that a wide audience would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually, they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that &quot;Myst&quot; had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note that clued players in to a chamber that played a message explaining the game&#x27;s objectives.

===Audio===
Chris Brandkamp served as sound engineer on &quot;Myst&quot;; he also doubled as Cyan&#x27;s chief financial officer. Brandkamp produced most of the ambient and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had to wait until the game&#x27;s visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch. Audio of bubbles, which he recalled as &quot;the most hateful sound&quot;, was created by blowing bubbles into differently-sized tubes in a toilet.

At first, &quot;Myst&quot; had no music, because the Millers did not want music to interfere with the gameplay. After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and heightened the mood of certain areas. Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of synthesized music that was used in the game and later published as &quot;Myst: The Soundtrack&quot;. Mixing and effects were done on an E-mu Proteus MPS synthesizer. The soundtrack was recorded over the course of two weeks&#x27; evenings. Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of &quot;Myst&quot;″s sequel, &quot;Riven&quot;, Virgin Records acquired the rights to release the soundtrack, and the CD was re-released on April 21, 1998. A limited-edition 2-LP vinyl release was released in April 2021. The release includes two colored LPs (pink and blue) with a vinyl-exclusive never-before-released track, &quot;AUDIO TRIAL 31—AGE FOUR&quot;, as well as never-before-seen documents, photographs, maps, and artifacts.

==Release==
&quot;Myst&quot; was released for Macintosh computers on September 30, 1993, marketed with the tagline &quot;The Surrealistic Adventure That Will Become Your World&quot;. Sample discs featuring a demo of the game&#x27;s Myst Island portion were made available as previews. The game was ported to Windows in March 1994. Publicity for the game relied on word of mouth, especially over the internet.

&quot;Myst&quot; became a massive commercial success. Prior to release, Rand Miller believed selling 100,000 copies would be &quot;mind-blowing&quot;; it sold double that amount in seven months. The game quickly became Broderbund&#x27;s most successful title, selling more than 500,000 copies by the end of 1994, and more than one million copies by March 1995. It was the best-selling computer game in the United States for 52 months. &quot;Myst&quot; sold more than 6.3 million units worldwide by 2000, including more than 4.3 million in the United States; and was the bestselling PC game throughout the 1990s until &quot;The Sims&quot; exceeded its sales in 2002. Along with &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, &quot;Myst&quot; was a killer application that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. The game was the first CD-ROM title to sell more than two million units.

==Remakes and ports==

&quot;Myst&quot;″s success led to the game being ported to multiple platforms. Versions for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, Atari Jaguar CD, AmigaOS, CD-i and 3DO consoles were released. A version for the Sega CD was developed and previewed by Sunsoft, but ultimately did not ship. A remaster, &quot;Myst: Masterpiece Edition&quot;, was released in May 2000. It features several improvements over the original game: the images are re-rendered in 24-bit truecolor instead of the original &quot;Myst&quot;″s 256 colors (8-bit); the score was remastered, and sound effects were enhanced. A 2023 fan effort &quot;demade&quot; the game for the Atari 2600.

A complete remake of &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;RealMyst: Interactive 3D Edition&quot;, was developed by Cyan and Sunsoft and published by Ubisoft in November 2000 for Windows PCs, and in January 2002 for Mac. Unlike the original game, the gameplay of &quot;realMyst&quot; features free-roaming, real-time 3D graphics. Weather effects and a day/night cycle were added to the Ages alongside minor additions to keep the game&#x27;s story in sync with later entries. The game also added a new Age called Rime, which is featured in an extended ending. While the new interactivity of the game was praised, &quot;realMyst&quot; ran poorly on most computers of the time. At release, Cyan described the remake as the game they would have originally made, had it not been for previous technology constraints. Robyn Miller later expressed frustration with &quot;realMyst&quot; and its marketing, saying that it was not how they had originally envisioned &quot;Myst&quot;.

In 2014, Cyan released a new visually enhanced revision of the game running on the Unity engine, &quot;realMyst: Masterpiece Edition&quot;. The remake was updated to version 2.0 on January 28, 2015, receiving a significant graphical overhaul in which several bugs were fixed and the detail of many models and textures was upgraded.

Handheld and mobile ports include a remake of &quot;Myst&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, first released in Japan in 2006. The remake included the Rime Age from &quot;realMyst&quot;, and higher-resolution widescreen visuals. Similar versions for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS released in 2007 and 2012. Cyan and Mean Hamster Software released &quot;Myst&quot; for the Microsoft Windows Mobile platform in 2005; &quot;Riven&quot; was ported shortly after. In August 2008, Cyan announced that the company was developing a version of &quot;Myst&quot; for Apple&#x27;s iOS. The game was made available to download from the iTunes App Store on May 2, 2009. The original download size was 727 MB, which was considered very large by iPhone standards. An updated version of &quot;realMyst&quot; was released for iPad 2 and above, with improved graphics over the original PC release, on June 14, 2012. A version for Android devices based on the &quot;realMyst&quot; version was released on January 26, 2017, produced and published by Noodlecake, and a similar port for &quot;Riven&quot; was released on April 26, 2017.

&quot;realMyst: Masterpiece Edition&quot; was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 21, 2020.

===3D remake for virtual reality and other platforms===
Cyan announced a new remake of &quot;Myst&quot; for high-definition screens and virtual reality, with the game&#x27;s worlds fully created in free-roam 3D environments, using Unreal Engine 4, along with features like puzzle randomization, in September 2020. &quot;Myst&quot; for the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 was released on December 10, 2020; on August 26, 2021, for Windows, macOS, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One; and on February 9, 2023, for iOS.

==Reception==
&quot;Myst&quot; was generally praised by critics. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; assured its readers that the game was not like other CD-ROM games that were &quot;high on glitz and low on substance ... &quot;Myst&quot; is everything it&#x27;s touted to be and is, quite simply, the best [Macintosh] CD-ROM game.&quot; It praised the game&#x27;s open-world nature, lack of player death, and &quot;straightforward and simple&quot; storyline. The magazine stated that the &quot;mesmerizing&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot; graphics and sound were &quot;not the star of the show ... the substance of the game is every bit as good as its packaging&quot;, and concluded that &quot;Myst&quot; &quot;is bound to set a new standard&quot;. In April 1994, the magazine called it an &quot;artistic masterwork&quot;. Jeff Koke reviewed &quot;Myst&quot; in &quot;Pyramid&quot; #8 (July/August 1994), and stated: &quot;It is the first adventure game in which I left feeling as though I had visited a real place.&quot;

&quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; were among the publications that pointed to &quot;Myst&quot; as evidence that video games could, in fact, evolve into an art form. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that some players considered &quot;Myst&quot;″s &quot;virtual morality&quot; a religious experience. Aarhus University professor Søren Pold pointed to &quot;Myst&quot; as an excellent example of how stories can be told using objects rather than people. Laura Evenson, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, pointed to adult-oriented games like &quot;Myst&quot; as evidence the video game industry was emerging from its &quot;adolescent&quot; phase.

GameSpot&#x27;s Jeff Sengstack wrote that &quot;&quot;Myst&quot; is an immersive experience that draws you in and won&#x27;t let you go.&quot; Writing about &quot;Myst&quot;″s reception, Greg M. Smith noted that &quot;Myst&quot; had become a hit and was regarded as incredibly immersive despite most closely resembling &quot;the hoary technology of the slideshow (with accompanying music and effects)&quot;. Smith concluded that &quot;&quot;Myst&quot;″s primary brilliance lies in the way it provides narrative justification for the very things that are most annoying&quot; about the technological constraints imposed on the game; for instance, &quot;Macworld&quot; praised &quot;Myst&quot;″s designers for overcoming the occasionally debilitating slowness of CD drives to deliver a consistent experience throughout the game. The publication went on to declare &quot;Myst&quot; the best game of 1994, stating that &quot;Myst&quot; removed the &quot;most annoying parts of adventure games—vocabularies that [you] don&#x27;t understand, people you can&#x27;t talk to, wrong moves that get you killed and make you start over. You try to unravel the enigma of the island by exploring the island, but there&#x27;s no time pressure to distract you, no arbitrary punishments put in your way&quot;.

Some aspects of the game still received criticism. Several publications did not agree with the positive reception of the story. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com noted that while its lack of interaction and continual plot suited the game, &quot;Myst&quot; contributed to a decline in the adventure game genre. &quot;Edge&quot; stated the main flaw with the game was that the game engine was nowhere near as sophisticated as the graphics. Heidi Fournier of &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; noted a few critics complained about the difficulty and lack of context of the puzzles, while others believed these elements added to the gameplay. Similarly, critics were split on whether the lack of a plot the player could actually change was a good or bad element. In 1996 &quot;Next Generation&quot; called &quot;Myst&quot; &quot;gaming&#x27;s bleakest hour&quot;, saying the static graphics and purely trial-and-error puzzles epitomized poor game design. The magazine said its commercial success, which they owed chiefly to its popularity among non-gamers as a CD-ROM showcase, had led to many other games emulating its negative aspects. In a 2000 retrospective review, &quot;IGN&quot; declared that &quot;Myst&quot; had not aged well and that playing it &quot;was like watching hit TV shows from the 70s. &#x27;People watched that?,&#x27; you wonder in horror.&quot;

&quot;Myst&quot; was named Best Adventure/Fantasy Role-Playing Game at the 1994 Codie awards, and received an honorable mention in &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot;″s 1993 &quot;Breakthrough Game&quot; category, which ultimately went to &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;. That magazine&#x27;s editors wrote, &quot;One of the best-looking, best-sounding games ever, the Macintosh version of &quot;Myst&quot; sets new standards for the effective use of CD-ROM.&quot; &quot;Myst&quot; was also a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1993 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award, but lost to &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; and &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; (tie). In 1996, the magazine ranked &quot;Myst&quot; 11th on its list of the most innovative computer games.

Reviews for the game&#x27;s console ports generally reflected each critic&#x27;s attitude towards the original game, as critics agreed that the ports for 3DO, Saturn, and PlayStation are virtually identical to the PC original. For example, Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the 3DO version a five out of ten, remarking: &quot;The graphics and sounds are decent but the game never really appealed to me on the PC&quot;, while his co-reviewer Danyon Carpenter gave it a seven out of ten and assessed that &quot;This game was all the rage when it debuted on the PC, and that excitement should follow through on the 3DO.&quot; In one of the more enthusiastic reviews for &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the 3DO version a perfect five out of five in all four categories (graphics, sound, control and fun factor), concluding: &quot;Beautiful and enchanting, &quot;Myst&quot; will thrill you and make you think at the same time.&quot; The Jaguar CD version was largely ignored by reviewers, but &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that apart from the Jaguar CD&#x27;s lack of a mouse peripheral and occasionally longer load times, this version too is identical to the PC original.

However, the 3DS version received negative reviews even from critics who felt that &quot;Myst&quot;″s popularity was merited, citing graphics and audio well below the 3DS&#x27;s capabilities and the use of awkward circle pad controls in lieu of the 3DS&#x27;s touchscreen.

===Legacy===
&quot;Myst&quot;″s success was due to its wide audience appeal, high-fidelity imagery combined with low system requirements, and the number of platforms it appeared on. It showed that games focused on puzzles instead of action could be major hits. &quot;Myst&quot;″s popularity baffled some, who wondered how a game that was seen as &quot;little more than &#x27;an interactive slide show&#x27;&quot; turned out to be a hit. As early as December 1994, &quot;Newsweek&quot; compared &quot;Myst&quot; to &quot;an art film, destined to gather critical acclaim and then dust on the shelves&quot;. Others criticized &quot;Myst&quot; as the &quot;ultimate anti-arcade game&quot;, as it was much more relaxed and casual than other games—the game required no special skills and there was no score or time limit. &quot;Myst&quot; was described by Stephen Kline and his coauthors as the &quot;anti-&quot;Doom&quot;&quot;; where &quot;Doom&quot; was violent, Satanic and focused on shock value and speed, &quot;Myst&quot; was tranquil and created by Christian developers.

In the wake of &quot;Myst&quot;″s sales, other developers sought to capitalize on comparing their games to &quot;Myst&quot;, or released &quot;&quot;Myst&quot; clones&quot; that sought to replicate its success. Some developers of adventure games concurrent to &quot;Myst&quot;″s release were critical of the game due to the number of subsequent titles that copied &quot;Myst&quot;″s style. As the adventure game genre faced a downturn, &quot;Gamecenter&quot; and others laid the blame squarely on &quot;Myst&quot;:
People wanted eye candy, not real storytelling. Never mind the fact that &quot;Myst&quot; had the worst ending in gaming history; never mind the fact that &quot;Myst&quot;″s idea of interactivity involved sparse clicks followed by hours of skull scratching. True adventure games came—&quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Gabriel Knight 3&quot;—and they failed to get sales.

In comparison, game designer Josh Mandel said the responsibility belonged to game publishers, who now expected every adventure game to be a &quot;Myst&quot;-caliber hit. &quot;Edge&quot;, writing in 1998, declared the game&#x27;s impact mixed, but one that ultimately did more good to the industry than harm, writing that it helped develop PC-based gaming.

&quot;Myst&quot; helped create a new way of thinking about presentation in video games due to the nature of the CD-ROM: whereas most games before could be viewed as &quot;games of emergence&quot;, in which game elements combined in novel and surprising ways to the player, &quot;Myst&quot; demonstrated one of the first &quot;games of progression&quot; where the player is guided through predefined sets of encounters. This helped to provide alternative experiences atypical of usual video games, and helped lay the foundations of more experimental indie video games developed in the 2000s. The game served as a precursor to casual games, which typically do not require players to act quickly, as well as an early predecessor to the walking simulators that allow players to explore at their own pace. Cyan&#x27;s sequels to &quot;Myst&quot; also indirectly served to popularize escape the room games, which provide similar puzzle-solving experiences but in a much more confined space.

&quot;Myst&quot; became a cultural touchstone of the day; the game was so popular the Miller brothers appeared in advertisements for The Gap. Actor Matt Damon wanted &quot;The Bourne Conspiracy&quot; video game to be a puzzle game like &quot;Myst&quot;, refusing to lend his voice talent to the game when it was turned into a shooter instead. &quot;Myst&quot; has also been used for educational and scientific purposes; Becta recognized a primary school teacher, Tim Rylands, who had made literacy gains using &quot;Myst&quot; as a teaching tool, and researchers have used the game for studies examining the effect of video games on aggression. A parody computer game, &quot;Pyst&quot;, was released in 1996; the game is a satirical free roam of Myst Island which had been apparently vandalized by frustrated visitors. &quot;Myst&quot; was added to the collection of video games of the Museum of Modern Art in 2013, where it is displayed as a video presentation.

&quot;Myst&quot;″s success sparked a multimedia franchise. &quot;Riven&quot; was released in 1997 and continues &quot;Myst&quot;″s storyline. Presto Studios and Ubisoft developed and published &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; in 2001, &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot; was developed and published entirely by Ubisoft and released in 2004. The latest game in the franchise is &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot;, developed by Cyan Worlds and released in 2005. In addition to the main games, Cyan developed &quot;&quot;. The multiplayer component of &quot;Uru&quot; was initially canceled, but GameTap eventually revived it as &quot;Myst Online: Uru Live&quot;. After &quot;Uru Live&quot; was cancelled, the game was released as an open source title. The Miller brothers collaborated with David Wingrove to produce several novels based on the &quot;Myst&quot; universe, which were published by Hyperion. The novels, entitled &quot;Myst: The Book of Atrus&quot;, &quot;Myst: The Book of Ti&#x27;ana&quot; and &quot;Myst: The Book of D&#x27;ni&quot;, fill in the games&#x27; backstory and were packaged together as &quot;The Myst Reader&quot;. By 2003, the &quot;Myst&quot; franchise had sold over twelve million copies worldwide, with &quot;Myst&quot; representing more than six million copies in the figure. Multiple attempts have been made to adapt the games and series into television series and feature films.

<doc id="219732" wikidata="Q49629" url="?curid=219732" title="Action Française">
<text>Action Française (, AF; ) was a French far-right monarchist and nationalist political movement. The name was also given to a journal associated with the movement, &quot;L&#x27;Action Française&quot;, sold by its own youth organization, the Camelots du Roi.

The movement and the journal were founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois in 1899, as a nationalist reaction against the intervention of left-wing intellectuals on behalf of Alfred Dreyfus. The royalist militant Charles Maurras quickly joined &quot;Action Française&quot; and became its principal ideologist. Under the influence of Maurras, &quot;Action Française&quot; became royalist, counter-revolutionary (objecting to the legacy of the French Revolution), anti-parliamentary, and pro-decentralization, espousing corporatism, integralism, and Roman Catholicism.

Shortly after it was created, &quot;Action Française&quot; tried to influence the public opinion by turning its journal into a daily newspaper and by setting up other organizations. It was at its most prominent during the 1899–1914 period. In the interwar period, the movement still enjoyed some prestige from support among conservative elites, but its popularity gradually declined as a result of the rise of fascism in Europe and of a rupture in its relations with the Catholic Church. During the Second World War, &quot;Action Française&quot; supported the Vichy Regime and Marshal Philippe Pétain. After the fall of the Vichy Regime, its newspaper was banned and Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1944, although he was reprieved in 1952.

The movement nevertheless continued in new publications and political associations, although with fading relevance as monarchism lost popularity, and French far-right movements shifted toward an emphasis on Catholic values and defense of traditional French culture. It is seen by some as one progenitor of the current National Rally political party.

==Ideology==
The ideology of &quot;Action Française&quot; was dominated by the precepts of Charles Maurras, following his adherence and his conversion of the movement&#x27;s founders to monarchism. The movement supported a restoration of the House of Bourbon-Orléans and, after the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, the restoration of Roman Catholicism as the state religion, all as rallying points in distinction to the Third Republic of France which was considered corrupt and atheistic by many of its opponents.

The movement advocated decentralization (a &quot;federal monarchy&quot;), with the restoration of pre-Revolutionary liberties to the ancient provinces of France (replaced during the Revolution by the departmental system). It aimed to achieve a restoration by means of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, probably involving a transitional authoritarian government.

&quot;Action Française&quot; was not focused on denouncing one social or political group as the conspiratorial source of ills befalling France. Different groups of the French far-right had animuses against Jews, Huguenots (French Calvinists), and Freemasons. To these, Maurras added unspecific foreigners residing in France, who had been outside French law under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, and to whom he invented a slur name derived from ancient Greek history: &quot;métèques&quot;. These four groups of &quot;internal foreigners&quot; Maurras called &quot;les quatre états confédérés&quot; and were all considered to be part of &quot;anti-France&quot;. He also opposed Marxism and the October Revolution, but antagonism against them did not have to be manufactured.

==History==
===Founding and rise (1898–1914)===
In 1899, Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois left the French nationalist movement &quot;Ligue de la Patrie française&quot; and established a new one, called &quot;Action Française&quot;, and its official journal, &quot;Revue de l&#x27;Action Française&quot;. This was their nationalist reaction against the intervention of left-wing intellectuals on the behalf of Alfred Dreyfus.
The royalist militant Charles Maurras quickly joined &quot;Action Française&quot; and became its principal ideologist. Under the influence of Maurras, the movement became royalist, counter-revolutionary (objecting to the legacy of the French Revolution), anti-parliamentary, and pro-decentralization, espousing corporatism, integralism, and Roman Catholicism. The Dreyfus affair gave some French Catholics the impression that Roman Catholicism is not compatible with democracy. Therefore, they regarded &quot;Action Française&quot; as rampart of religion and the most fitting expression of the church doctrine regarding society.

In its early years, &quot;Action Française&quot; tried to influence public opinion and to spread its ideas. For example, it created related organisations, such as student groups. The political organisation of the movement, the Ligue d&#x27;Action Française, was launched in the spring of 1905, as was the Action Française Federation of Students, directed by Lucien Moreau. &quot;L&#x27;Institut d&#x27;Action française&quot; was created in 1906 as an alternative institute for higher education. In 1908 the movement&#x27;s periodical was turned to a daily newspaper, called simply &quot;Action Française&quot;. Camelots du Roi, the movement&#x27;s youth wing, was created in the same year to sell the newspaper in the streets. Its members also served as a paramilitary wing, providing security for meetings and engaging in street violence with political opponents. The newspaper&#x27;s literary quality and polemical vigor attracted readers and made Maurras and the movement significant figures in French politics. By 1914, &quot;Action Française&quot; had become the best structured and the most vital nationalist movement in France.

===First World War and aftermath (1914–1926)===
During the First World War, &quot;Action Française&quot; supported the Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and the will to defeat the Germans. France&#x27;s victory in the war and the movement&#x27;s anti-German intransigence on the peace terms set forth by the Treaty of Versailles (1919) between Germany and the Allied Powers resulted in a peak of success, prestige and influence during the interwar period. For example, in 1917 it moved into new spacious offices on the rue Caumartin, near St. Lazare train station. However, in the French legislative elections of 16 November 1919 Bernard de Vésins, president of the &quot;Ligue d&#x27;Action Française&quot;, was defeated in the first district of Paris.

&quot;Action Française&quot; exploited the disquiet aroused on the right by the victory of the left-wing coalition (&quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot;) founded by the Radical politician Édouard Herriot in 1924 and the fear of communism (&quot;see also&quot;: Red Scare), sending about thirty candidates to the French Parliament. Well-known French writers endorsed the movement, which advertised itself as the thinking man&#x27;s party. Literary reviews, especially &quot;Revue universelle&quot;, spread the message of &quot;Action Française&quot;. The polemics of the review, its personal attacks on leaders, and its systematic exploitation of scandals and crises helped detach some of the intellectuals from their allegiance to the French Republic and democracy. This agitation culminated in the 6 February 1934 crisis. The successes shaped the ideology of &quot;Action Française&quot;; hence, it became more integrated into mainstream conservatism, stressing patriotism and Roman Catholicism as opposed to monarchism.

===Papal condemnation and decline===
In spite of the movement&#x27;s support for Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France, and the fact that the vast majority of its members were practising Catholics (indeed, they included significant numbers of clergymen), some French Catholics regarded it with suspicion and distrust. Much of this was due to the influence of Maurras, an agnostic who advocated Roman Catholicism as a factor of social cohesion and stability and a vital element of the French tradition. This rather utilitarian view of religion disturbed many who otherwise agreed with him. Its influence on younger generations of French Catholics was also considered unwholesome. Thus, Pope Pius XI condemned &quot;Action Française&quot; on 29 December 1926.

Several of Maurras&#x27;s writings were placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; at the same time, on 9 January 1927, with &quot;Action Française&quot; being the first newspaper ever placed on the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of banned books. This was a devastating blow to the movement. On 8 March 1927, AF members were prohibited from receiving the sacraments. Many of its members left the movement and were forced to look for a different path in politics and life, such as writers François Mauriac and Georges Bernanos, and it entered a period of decline.

In 1939, following the Spanish Civil War and a revival of anti-communism within the Catholic Church, Pope Pius XII decided to end the condemnation. Thereafter, &quot;Action Française&quot; claimed that the condemnation had been declared for political purposes.

===Interwar revival===
Despite the 1926 Papal condemnation, &quot;Action Française&quot; remained popular during the interwar period, being one of the most important far-right leagues in France, along with the &quot;Croix-de-Feu&quot; and others. As increasing numbers of people in France (as in Europe as a whole) turned to authoritarian political movements, many French citizens joined the &quot;Action Française&quot;. It thus continued to recruit members from the new generations, such as Robert Brasillach (who would become a collaborationist during the Second World War), the novelist and former deputy and ambassador Pierre Benoist, Thierry Maulnier, and Lucien Rebatet. It was marginally represented for a time in the Chamber of Deputies, particularly by Léon Daudet, elected in the right-wing conservative coalition &quot;Bloc National&quot; (1919–1924).

However, with the rise of fascism in Europe and the creation of seemingly fascist leagues, added to the 1926 Papal condemnation, the royalist movement was weakened by various dissidents: Georges Valois would create the short-lived fascist movement &quot;Faisceau&quot;; Louis Dimier would break away, while other members (Eugène Deloncle, Gabriel Jeantet, etc.) created &quot;La Cagoule&quot;, a far-right terrorist organization.

The retired Admiral Antoine Schwerer became president of the league in 1930, succeeding Bernard de Vésins in difficult circumstances.
He was a talented orator.
At the December 1931 congress, &quot;greeted by loud acclamation&quot;, he gave himself to a full presentation of &quot;the general situation of France&quot;, external, financial, economic, interior and religious. He concluded with a passionate statement,

Antoine Schwerer was forced by illness to retire to Brittany in 1935. He was succeeded as head of the league by François de Lassus.

John Gunther wrote that of the more than 100 daily newspapers in Paris, only &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; and &quot;Action Française&quot; were honest. The group participated in the 6 February 1934 crisis, which led to the fall of the second &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot; and to the replacement of the centre-left Radical-Socialist Édouard Daladier by the centre-right Radical Gaston Doumergue. In foreign policy, Maurras and Bainville supported Pierre Laval&#x27;s double alliance with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy and with the United Kingdom in the Stresa Front (1935) on one side, and with the Soviet Union on the other side, against the common enemy Nazi Germany. The &quot;Action française&quot; greeted Franco&#x27;s appearance with delight, and supported the self-proclaimed &quot;Caudillo&quot; during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). But the extra-parliamentary agitation brought by the far-right leagues, including the AF, led Pierre Laval&#x27;s government to outlaw militias and paramilitary leagues, leading to the dissolution of the AF on 13 February 1936 – the other leagues were dissolved only in June 1936 by the Popular Front.

Marshal Philippe Pétain&#x27;s proclamation of the Vichy Regime and of the &quot;Révolution nationale&quot; after the failure of the Battle of France was acclaimed by Maurras as a &quot;divine surprise&quot;, and he rallied the collaborationist government. Royalist members hoped that Pétain would restore the monarchy, and the headquarters of the movement were moved from Paris to Vichy. However, the AF members were split between supporting the collaborationist regime and their nationalist sentiment: after 1942, and in particular in 1943, some members, such as Henri d&#x27;Astier de la Vigerie, Pierre Guillain de Bénouville, and Honoré d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves either joined the French Resistance or escaped to join the Free French Forces. Others actively collaborated, while Maurras supported the Vichy Regime, but theoretically opposed Pétain&#x27;s collaboration with the Germans. After the Liberation of France, he was condemned to life imprisonment in 1944, although he was reprieved in 1952. &quot;Action Française&quot; was dissolved in 1944.

=== Post-1944 Developments ===
Following the fall of the Vichy regime, the original &quot;Action Française&quot; newspaper was banned, and Charles Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1944, though he was released in 1952. The movement restructured in 1947 under Maurice Pujo, who founded the newspaper &quot;Aspects de la France&quot; and the counter-revolutionary organization Restauration Nationale. Despite diminishing relevance due to the decline of monarchism, the movement maintained influence through publications and associations. In 1971, the split of the &quot;Nouvelle Action Française,&quot; which later evolved into the &quot;Nouvelle Action Royaliste&quot;, highlighted the divergence within monarchist circles, as younger leaders sought to modernize its doctrines.

By the late 20th century, figures associated with the movement, such as Pierre Pujo, continued its legacy with journals like &quot;L&#x27;Action française 2000&quot;. Although it no longer commands significant political clout, the movement has influenced contemporary right-wing currents in France, including the National Rally, due to its focus on Catholic values and preserving traditional French culture.

==Judgment of political scientists==
===Classification as fascist===
In 1965, the German historian Ernst Nolte claimed that &quot;Action Française&quot; was a fascist movement. He considered &quot;Action Française&quot; to be the first fascist party in European history.

Certain present-day scholars disagree with Nolte&#x27;s view. For example, in 1999, the British historian Richard Thurlow claimed that &quot;his [Nolte&#x27;s] linking of &quot;Action française&quot; to the fascist tradition was misleading&quot;. Later, René Rémond and Stanley G. Payne described the differences between &quot;Action Française&quot; and Italian fascism.

===Influence on national syndicalism and fascism===
In the books &quot;Neither Right nor Left&quot; and &quot;The Birth of Fascist Ideology&quot;, Zeev Sternhell claimed that &quot;Action française&quot; influenced national syndicalism and, consequently, fascism.
According to Sternhell, national syndicalism was formed by the combination between the integral nationalism of &quot;Action française&quot; and the revolutionary syndicalism of Georges Sorel. National syndicalism spread to Italy, and was later a part of the doctrine of Italian fascist movement.
In France, national syndicalism influenced the non-conformists of the 1930s. Based on the views of the non-conformists themselves, Sternhell argued that the non-conformists were actually a French form of fascism.

===René Rémond&#x27;s classification===
Although it supported the Orléanist branch, according to historian René Rémond&#x27;s categorization of French right-wing groups, AF would be closer to the legitimist branch, characterized by a complete rejection of all changes to France since the 1789 French Revolution. According to Rémond, supporters of the Orléanist branch tended to favour economic liberalism.

<text>Edwin Harold Flack (5 November 1873 – 10 January 1935) was an Australian athlete and tennis player. Also known as &quot;Teddy&quot;, he was Australia&#x27;s first Olympian, being its only representative in 1896, and the first Olympic champion in the 800 metres and the 1500 metres running events.

Following Flack&#x27;s Olympic appearance, he did not compete in any large events again, opting to breed cattle and help his family&#x27;s accounting firm. Flack died aged 61 following an operation, and was buried in his hometown of Berwick. He is commemorated there by a bronze statue on High Street and a reserve which includes several sporting grounds. Flack was also inducted into the Sport Australia and Athletics Australia halls of fame in 1985 and 2000, respectively.

== Early life ==
Born in London, England, Edwin Flack was five years old when his family migrated to Australia, to live in Berwick, Victoria. Soon after leaving the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School in 1892, where he studied Greek history, Flack joined his father&#x27;s accountancy firm, Davey, Flack &amp; Co. From 1892 to 1894, Flack was active in middle and long-distance running in amateur athletics in the then colony of Victoria, competing with the Melburnian Hare &amp; Hounds athletics club. In October 1892 he placed third in the inaugural Victorian 10-mile cross country championship, held at Oakleigh (Park) Racecourse, in a time of 1:02.42.0.

On 9 to 11 November 1893, an intercolonial meet described as the Australasian Athletics Championships was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, between athletes from the British colonies that were later to form the nations of Australia and New Zealand. This was the second such meet, the first having been held at Moore Park in Sydney on 31 May 1890. Flack competed in the 1893 event and won the mile championship in a time of 4:44.0, with a winning margin of two yards. He also competed in the 880 yards (won by Ken McCrae of New South Wales in 2:06.8) and three miles championship (won by Charles Herbert of Victoria in 15:33.6), but was unplaced in both events. By virtue of his win in the mile event he was also awarded the Victorian 1893 mile championship title and, on 30 September 1893, was third in the Victorian 10 mile cross country championship in a time of 1:05.21.

On 15 December 1894, Flack won both the 880 yards (2:07.2) and mile (4:49.4) Victorian 1894 championships and, earlier in the year, on 22 September 1894 was second in the 10-mile cross country championship (1:00.02). The 1894 event was Flack&#x27;s last appearance in the Victorian Championships. The same year, Flack was sent to London to receive further training as an accountant with the firm Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). Flack joined the London Athletic Club and was intent on attending the coming inaugural Olympics. Flack attended the Olympics as a member of the London Athletic Club, but competed in his Melburnian Hare and Hounds colours.

== 1896 Olympics ==

Flack reached Athens after an uncomfortable six-day rail and sea trip, during which he was plagued with sea sickness. On the opening day of the Games he won his first race, the first heat of the 800 metres run, finishing in a time of 2 min 10.0 sec. On the second day he lined up against the American favourite, Arthur Blake, in the 1500 metres run. Running shoulder to shoulder with Blake in the final straight, Flack powered ahead near the end to win by more than five metres in a time of 4:33.2. On the fourth day of the Games, Flack earned his second first-place medal, winning the 800 metres in 2 min 11.9 sec.

It may be noted that, even by the standards of the time, the times required to win the 800 m and 1,500 m at the first Olympics were slow. Although there was no official world record in that era, by way of comparison, the local 880 yards championship in Flack&#x27;s home colony of Victoria was won that year in 2:04.4 and the previous year (1895) in 2:03.4. At the Australasian Championships of 1896, the mile run was won by New Zealander W. Bennett in a time of 4:28.6 – some 4.6s quicker than Flack&#x27;s Olympic 1500 m time despite running 100 metres further.

Just a day later, Flack tried for a treble with the marathon event despite never having run a race more than 16 kilometres. He was in second place behind Frenchman Albin Lermusiaux—bronze medallist in the 1500 m run, whom Flack had already beaten—for much of the race. After 30–32 kilometres, the Frenchman dropped out and Flack was left in the lead, but 4–8 kilometres later (sources vary), Flack collapsed. In his deliriousness, when a Greek spectator tried to help him, Flack punched him to the ground. Flack was removed from the course and transported to the stadium by a carriage, wherein he was tended to by Prince Nicholas.

Flack also competed in the tennis singles and doubles at the Olympics. He lost in the first round of the singles to Aristidis Akratopoulos of Greece. In the doubles he was paired with an English friend, George S. Robertson. They reached the semi-finals after a walkover in the first round, but lost their only match to Dionysios Kasdaglis of Egypt and Demetrios Petrokokkinos of Greece. They placed third due to their semi-final appearance, but medals for third places were not yet awarded in 1896. The medals were retroactively awarded in January 2008.

Flack was a popular competitor at the 1896 games, and was commonly referred to as the &quot;Lion of Athens&quot;.

== Later life ==
In 1898, Flack returned to Victoria and the Melbourne-based family accounting firm,was renamed Flack and Flack. Flack purchased a property near Berwick, where he stayed on weekends and bred Friesian cattle. He never competed for Victoria again (or for Australia after the country was formed in 1901), but he joined the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) and was part of the first Australian delegation to attend an International Olympic Committee (IOC) Congress. After developing heart problems, Flack died in 1935, following an operation at a private hospital. He was cremated and his ashes were interred at Berwick Cemetery.

== Legacy ==

Flack is commemorated by a bronze statue on the median strip of High St, Berwick, which was unveiled in 1998 by former running great and later Governor of Victoria John Landy. The former Berwick Recreational Reserve was renamed &quot;Edwin Flack Reserve&quot; in 1996 to honour the town&#x27;s first Olympic hero and medal winner, and it includes several sporting grounds including an athletics track, an Australian rules football oval, netball courts and soccer pitch. Melbourne Grammar School&#x27;s sporting complex at Port Melbourne has been named &quot;Edwin Flack Park&quot; in honour of their past student.

Flack was commemorated on a 45-cent Australian postage stamp in the Olympic centenary year of 1996. The AOC named one of the streets alongside Stadium Australia at Homebush Bay in Sydney, the venue of the 2000 Summer Olympics, as &quot;Edwin Flack Avenue&quot;. In 1985, Flack was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and he was inducted into the Athletics Australia Hall of Fame in 2000. Athletics Australia&#x27;s Edwin Flack Award, which is awarded to &quot;an athlete who has rendered distinguished service to athletics&quot;, is named in his honour.

Flack was portrayed by English actor Benedict Taylor in the 1984 television mini-series &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;.

<doc id="219736" wikidata="Q905504" url="?curid=219736" title="Indoor air quality">
<text>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is the air quality within buildings and structures. Poor indoor air quality due to indoor air pollution is known to affect the health, comfort, and well-being of building occupants. It has also been linked to sick building syndrome, respiratory issues, reduced productivity, and impaired learning in schools. Common pollutants of indoor air include: secondhand tobacco smoke, air pollutants from indoor combustion, radon, molds and other allergens, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, legionella and other bacteria, asbestos fibers, carbon dioxide, ozone and particulates.

Source control, filtration, and the use of ventilation to dilute contaminants are the primary methods for improving indoor air quality. Although ventilation is an integral component of maintaining good indoor air quality, it may not be satisfactory alone. In scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality, other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary.

IAQ is evaluated through collection of air samples, monitoring human exposure to pollutants, analysis of building surfaces, and computer modeling of air flow inside buildings. IAQ is part of indoor environmental quality (IEQ), along with other factors that exert an influence on physical and psychological aspects of life indoors (e.g., lighting, visual quality, acoustics, and thermal comfort).

Indoor air pollution is a major health hazard in developing countries and is commonly referred to as &quot;household air pollution&quot; in that context. It is mostly relating to cooking and heating methods by burning biomass fuel, in the form of wood, charcoal, dung, and crop residue, in indoor environments that lack proper ventilation. Millions of people, primarily women and children, face serious health risks. In total, about three billion people in developing countries are affected by this problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cooking-related indoor air pollution causes 3.8 million annual deaths. The Global Burden of Disease study estimated the number of deaths in 2017 at 1.6 million.

== Definition ==
For health reasons it is crucial to breathe clean air, free from chemicals and toxicants as much as possible. It is estimated that humans spend approximately 90% of their lifetime indoors and that indoor air pollution in some places can be much worse than that of the ambient air.

Various factors contribute to high concentrations of pollutants indoors, ranging from influx of pollutants from external sources, off-gassing by furniture, furnishings including carpets, indoor activities (cooking, cleaning, painting, smoking, etc. in homes to using office equipment in offices), thermal comfort parameters such as temperature, humidity, airflow and physio-chemical properties of the indoor air. Air pollutants can enter a building in many ways, including through open doors or windows. Poorly maintained air conditioners/ventilation systems can harbor mold, bacteria, and other contaminants, which are then circulated throughout indoor spaces, contributing to respiratory problems and allergies.

There have been many debates among indoor air quality specialists about the proper definition of indoor air quality and specifically what constitutes &quot;acceptable&quot; indoor air quality.

== Health effects ==

IAQ is significant for human health as humans spend a large proportion of their time in indoor environments. Americans and Europeans on average spend approximately 90% of their time indoors.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.2 million people die prematurely every year from illnesses attributed to indoor air pollution caused by indoor cooking, with over 237 thousand of these being children under 5. These include around an eighth of all global ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer deaths. Overall the WHO estimated that poor indoor air quality resulted in the loss of 86 million healthy life years in 2019.

Studies in the UK and Europe show exposure to indoor air pollutants, chemicals and biological contamination can irritate the upper airway system, trigger or exacerbate asthma and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, and may even have carcinogenic effects.

Poor indoor air quality can cause sick building syndrome. Symptoms include burning of the eyes, scratchy throat, blocked nose, and headaches.

==Common pollutants==

===Generated by indoor combustion===


Indoor combustion, such as for cooking or heating, is a major cause of indoor air pollution and causes significant health harms and premature deaths. Hydrocarbon fires cause air pollution. Pollution is caused by both biomass and fossil fuels of various types, but some forms of fuels are more harmful than others.

Indoor fire can produce black carbon particles, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and mercury compounds, among other emissions. Around 3 billion people cook over open fires or on rudimentary cook stoves. Cooking fuels are coal, wood, animal dung, and crop residues. IAQ is a particular concern in low and middle-income countries where such practices are common.

Cooking using natural gas (also called fossil gas, methane gas or simply gas) is associated with poorer indoor air quality. Combustion of gas produces nitrogen dioxide and carbon monixide, and can lead to increased concentrations of nitrogen dioxide throughout the home environment which is linked to respiratory issues and diseases.

==== Carbon monoxide ====

One of the most acutely toxic indoor air contaminants is carbon monoxide (CO), a colourless and odourless gas that is a by-product of incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide may be emitted from tobacco smoke and generated from malfunctioning fuel burning stoves (wood, kerosene, natural gas, propane) and fuel burning heating systems (wood, oil, natural gas) and from blocked flues connected to these appliances. In developed countries the main sources of indoor CO emission come from cooking and heating devices that burn fossil fuels and are faulty, incorrectly installed or poorly maintained. Appliance malfunction may be due to faulty installation or lack of maintenance and proper use. In low- and middle-income countries the most common sources of CO in homes are burning biomass fuels and cigarette smoke.

Health effects of CO poisoning may be acute or chronic and can occur unintentionally or intentionally (self-harm). By depriving the brain of oxygen, acute exposure to carbon monoxide may have effects on the neurological system (headache, nausea, dizziness, alteration in consciousness and subjective weakness), the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (myocardial infarction, shortness of breath, or rapid breathing, respiratory failure). Acute exposure can also lead to long-term neurological effects such as cognitive and behavioural changes. Severe CO poisoning may lead to unconsciousness, coma and death. Chronic exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide may lead to lethargy, headaches, nausea, flu-like symptoms and neuropsychological and cardiovascular issues.

The WHO recommended levels of indoor CO exposure in 24 hours is 4 mg/m3. Acute exposure should not exceed 10 mg/m3 in 8 hours, 35 mg/m3 in one hour and 100 mg/m3 in 15 minutes.

==== Secondhand tobacco smoke ====

Secondhand smoke is tobacco smoke which affects people other than the &#x27;active&#x27; smoker. It is made up of the exhaled smoke (15%) and mostly of smoke coming from the burning end of the cigarette, known as sidestream smoke (85%).

Secondhand smoke contains more than 7000 chemicals, of which hundreds are harmful to health. Secondhand tobacco smoke includes both a gaseous and a particulate materials which, with particular hazards arising from levels of carbon monoxide and very small particulates (fine particulate matter, especially PM2.5 and PM10) which get into the bronchioles and alveoles in the lung. Inhaling secondhand smoke on multiple occasions can cause asthma, pneumonia, lung cancer, and sudden infant death syndrome, among other conditions.

Thirdhand smoke (THS) refers to chemicals that settle on objects and bodies indoors after smoking. Exposure to thirdhand smoke can happen even after the actual cigarette smoke is not present anymore and affect those entering the indoor environment much later. Toxic substances of THS can react with other chemicals in the air and produce new toxic chemicals that are otherwise not present in cigarettes.

The only certain method to improve indoor air quality as regards secondhand smoke is to eliminate smoking indoors. Indoor e-cigarette use also increases home particulate matter concentrations.

==== Particulates ====
Atmospheric particulate matter, also known as particulates, can be found indoors and can affect the health of occupants. Indoor particulate matter can come from different indoor sources or be created as secondary aerosols through indoor gas-to-particle reactions. They can also be outdoor particles that enter indoors. These indoor particles vary widely in size, ranging from nanomet (nanoparticles/ultrafine particles emitted from combustion sources) to micromet (resuspensed dust). Particulate matter can also be produced through cooking activities. Frying produces higher concentrations than boiling or grilling and cooking meat produces higher concentrations than cooking vegetables. Preparing a Thanksgiving dinner can produce very high concentrations of particulate matter, exceeding 300 μg/m3.

Particulates can penetrate deep into the lungs and brain from blood streams, causing health problems such as heart disease, lung disease, cancer and preterm birth.

=== Generated from building materials, furnishing and consumer products ===

==== Volatile organic compounds ====
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. There are numerous sources of VOCs indoors, which means that their concentrations are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. Some VOCs are emitted directly indoors, and some are formed through the subsequent chemical reactions that can occur in the gas-phase, or on surfaces. VOCs presenting health hazards include benzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene.

VOCs are emitted by thousands of indoor products. Examples include: paints, varnishes, waxes and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning and personal care products, pesticides, building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and carbonless copy paper, graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions. Chlorinated drinking water releases chloroform when hot water is used in the home. Benzene is emitted from fuel stored in attached garages.

Human activities such as cooking and cleaning can also emit VOCs. Cooking can release long-chain aldehydes and alkanes when oil is heated and terpenes can be released when spices are prepared and/or cooked. Leaks of natural gas from cooking appliances have been linked to elevated levels of VOCs including benzene in homes in the USA. Cleaning products contain a range of VOCs, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols and esters. Once released into the air, VOCs can undergo reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals to produce other VOCs, such as formaldehyde.

Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; and damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system.

Testing emissions from building materials used indoors has become increasingly common for floor coverings, paints, and many other important indoor building materials and finishes. Indoor materials such as gypsum boards or carpet act as VOC &#x27;sinks&#x27;, by trapping VOC vapors for extended periods of time, and releasing them by outgassing. The VOCs can also undergo transformation at the surface through interaction with ozone. In both cases, these delayed emissions can result in chronic and low-level exposures to VOCs.

Several initiatives aim to reduce indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems containing low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, M1, Blue Angel and Indoor Air Comfort in Europe, as well as California Standard CDPH Section 01350 and several others in the US. Due to these initiatives an increasing number of low-emitting products became available to purchase.

At least 18 microbial VOCs (MVOCs) have been characterised including 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom alcohol), 3-Methylfuran, 2-pentanol, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, 3-octanone, 3-octanol, 2-octen-1-ol, 1-octene, 2-pentanone, 2-nonanone, borneol, geosmin, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, and thujopsene. The last four are products of &quot;Stachybotrys chartarum&quot;, which has been linked with sick building syndrome.

==== Asbestos fibers ====
Many common building materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.

When asbestos-containing material is damaged or disintegrates, microscopic fibers are dispersed into the air. Inhalation of asbestos fibers over long exposure times is associated with increased incidence of lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis. The risk of lung cancer from inhaling asbestos fibers is significantly greater for smokers. The symptoms of disease do not usually appear until about 20 to 30 years after the first exposure to asbestos.

Although all asbestos is hazardous, products that are friable, e.g. sprayed coatings and insulation, pose a significantly higher hazard as they are more likely to release fibers to the air.

==== Microplastics ====

Microplastic is a type of airborne particulates and is found to prevail in air. A 2017 study found indoor airborne microfiber concentrations between 1.0 and 60.0 microfibers per cubic meter (33% of which were found to be microplastics). Airborne microplastic dust can be produced during renovation, building, bridge and road reconstruction projects and the use of power tools.

==== Ozone ====

Indoors ozone (O3) is produced by certain high-voltage electric devices (such as air ionizers), and as a by-product of other types of pollution. It appears in lower concentrations indoors than outdoors, usually at 0.2-0.7 of the outdoor concentration. Typically, most ozone is lost to surface reactions indoors, rather than to reactions in air, due to the large surface to volume ratios found indoors.

Outdoor air used for ventilation may have sufficient ozone to react with common indoor pollutants as well as skin oils and other common indoor air chemicals or surfaces. Particular concern is warranted when using &quot;green&quot; cleaning products based on citrus or terpene extracts, because these chemicals react very quickly with ozone to form toxic and irritating chemicals as well as fine and ultrafine particles. Ventilation with outdoor air containing elevated ozone concentrations may complicate remediation attempts.

The WHO standard for ozone concentration is 60 μg/m3 for long-term exposure and 100 μg/m3 as the maximum average over an 8-hour period. The EPA standard for ozone concentration is 0.07 ppm average over an 8-hour period.

=== Biological agents ===

==== Mold and other allergens ====
Occupants in buildings can be exposed to fungal spores, cell fragments, or mycotoxins which can arise from a host of means, but there are two common classes: (a) excess moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen.

While mold growth is associated with high moisture levels, it is likely to grow when a combination of favorable conditions arises. As well as high moisture levels, these conditions include suitable temperatures, pH and nutrient sources. Mold grows primarily on surfaces, and it reproduces by releasing spores, which can travel and settle in different locations. When these spores experience appropriate conditions, they can germinate and lead to mycelium growth. Different mold species favor different environmental conditions to germinate and grow, some being more hydrophilic (growing at higher levels of relative humidity) and other more xerophilic (growing at levels of relative humidity as low as 75–80%).

Mold growth can be inhibited by keeping surfaces at conditions that are further from condensation, with relative humidity levels below 75%. This usually translates to a relative humidity of indoor air below 60%, in agreement with the guidelines for thermal comfort that recommend a relative humidity between 40 and 60 %. Moisture buildup in buildings may arise from water penetrating areas of the building envelope or fabric, from plumbing leaks, rainwater or groundwater penetration, or from condensation due to improper ventilation, insufficient heating or poor thermal quality of the building envelope. Even something as simple as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of mold growth, if the humidity produced is not able to escape the building via ventilation.

Mold predominantly affects the airways and lungs. Known effects of mold on health include asthma development and exacerbation, with children and elderly at greater risk of more severe health impacts. Infants in homes with mold have a much greater risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. More than half of adult workers in moldy or humid buildings suffer from nasal or sinus symptoms due to mold exposure. Some varieties of mold contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

==== &quot;Legionella&quot; ====

Legionnaires&#x27; disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium &quot;Legionella&quot; that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of &quot;Legionella&quot; in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains at public attractions. The presence of &quot;Legionella&quot; in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.

&quot;Legionella&quot; testing typically involves collecting water samples and surface swabs from evaporative cooling basins, shower heads, faucets/taps, and other locations where warm water collects. The samples are then cultured and colony forming units (cfu) of Legionella are quantified as cfu/liter.

&quot;Legionella&quot; is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for &quot;Legionella&quot; outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often include very hot water flushes (), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and, in some cases, flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.

==== Other bacteria ====

There are many bacteria of health significance found in indoor air and on indoor surfaces. The role of microbes in the indoor environment is increasingly studied using modern gene-based analysis of environmental samples. Currently, efforts are under way to link microbial ecologists and indoor air scientists to forge new methods for analysis and to better interpret the results.

A large fraction of the bacteria found in indoor air and dust are shed from humans. Among the most important bacteria known to occur in indoor air are Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae.

==== Virus ====

Viruses can also be a concern for indoor air quality. During the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, virus-laden aerosols were found to have seeped into bathrooms from the bathroom floor drains, exacerbated by the draw of bathroom exhaust fans, resulting in the rapid spread of SARS in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong. Elsewhere in Hong Kong, SARS CoV RNA was found on the carpet and in the air intake vents of the Metropole Hotel, which showed that secondary environmental contamination could generate infectious aerosols and resulted in superspreading events.

===Carbon dioxide===
Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide (CO2) in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.

Indoor CO2 levels above 500 ppm can lead to higher blood pressure and heart rate, and increased peripheral blood circulation. With CO2 concentrations above 1000 ppm cognitive performance might be affected, especially when doing complex tasks, making decision making and problem solving slower but not less accurate. However, evidence on the health effects of CO2 at lower concentrations is conflicting and it is difficult to link CO2 to health impacts at exposures below 5000 ppm – reported health outcomes may be due to the presence of human bioeffluents, and other indoor air pollutants related to inadequate ventilation.

Indoor carbon dioxide concentrations can be used to evaluate the quality of a room or a building&#x27;s ventilation. To eliminate most complaints caused by CO2, the total indoor CO2 level should be reduced to a difference of no greater than 700 ppm above outdoor levels. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation. The UK standards for schools say that carbon dioxide levels of 800 ppm or lower indicate that the room is well-ventilated. Regulations and standards from around the world show that CO2 levels below 1000 ppm represent good IAQ, between 1000 and 1500 ppm represent moderate IAQ and greater than 1500 ppm represent poor IAQ.

Carbon dioxide concentrations in closed or confined rooms can increase to 1,000 ppm within 45 minutes of enclosure. For example, in a sized office, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased from 500 ppm to over 1,000 ppm within 45 minutes of ventilation cessation and closure of windows and doors.

===Radon===
Radon is an invisible, radioactive atomic gas that results from the radioactive decay of radium, which may be found in rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves.

Radon is probably the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe. It is a major cause of lung cancer, responsible for 3–14% of cases in countries, leading to tens of thousands of deaths.

Radon gas enters buildings as a soil gas. As it is a heavy gas it will tend to accumulate at the lowest level. Radon may also be introduced into a building through drinking water particularly from bathroom showers. Building materials can be a rare source of radon, but little testing is carried out for stone, rock or tile products brought into building sites; radon accumulation is greatest for well insulated homes. There are simple do-it-yourself kits for radon gas testing, but a licensed professional can also check homes.

The half-life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. Radon mitigation methods include sealing concrete slab floors, basement foundations, water drainage systems, or by increasing ventilation. They are usually cost effective and can greatly reduce or even eliminate the contamination and the associated health risks.

Radon is measured in picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L) or becquerel per cubic meter (Bq m-3). Both are measurements of radioactivity. The World Health Organization (WHO) sets the ideal indoor radon levels at 100 Bq/m-3. In the United States, it is recommend to fix homes with radon levels at or above 4 pCi/L. At the same time it is also recommends that people think about fixing their homes for radon levels between 2 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L. In the United Kingdom the ideal is presence of radon indoors is 100 Bq/m-3. Action needs to be taken in homes with 200 Bq/m−3 or more.

Interactive maps of radon affected areas are available for various regions and countries of the world.

== IAQ and climate change ==

Indoor air quality is linked inextricably to outdoor air quality. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has varying scenarios that predict how the climate will change in the future. Climate change can affect indoor air quality by increasing the level of outdoor air pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter, for example through emissions from wildfires caused by extreme heat and drought. Numerous predictions for how indoor air pollutants will change have been made, and models have attempted to predict how the forecasted IPCC scenarios will vary indoor air quality and indoor comfort parameters such as humidity and temperature.

The net-zero challenge requires significant changes in the performance of both new and retrofitted buildings. However, increased energy efficient housing will trap pollutants inside, whether produced indoors or outdoors, and lead to an increase in human exposure.

== Indoor air quality standards and monitoring ==

=== Quality guidelines and standards ===
For occupational exposure, there are standards, which cover a wide range of chemicals, and applied to healthy adults who are exposed over time at workplaces (usually industrial environments).These are published by organisations such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

There is no consensus globally about indoor air quality standards, or health-based guidelines. However, there are regulations from some individual countries and from health organisations. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published health-based global air quality guidelines for the general population that are applicable both to outdoor and indoor air, as well as the WHO IAQ guidelines for selected compounds, whereas the UK Health Security Agency published IAQ guidelines for selected VOCs. The Scientific and Technical Committee (STC34) of the International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate (ISIAQ) created an open database that collects indoor environmental quality guidelines worldwide. The database is focused on indoor air quality (IAQ), but is currently extended to include standards, regulations, and guidelines related to ventilation, comfort, acoustics, and lighting.

=== Real-time monitoring ===
Since indoor air pollutants can adversely affect human health, it is important to have real-time indoor air quality assessment/monitoring system that can help not only in the improvement of indoor air quality but also help in detection of leaks, spills in a work environment and boost energy efficiency of buildings by providing real-time feedback to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system(s). Additionally, there have been enough studies that highlight the correlation between poor indoor air quality and loss of performance and productivity of workers in an office setting.  

Combining the Internet of Things (IoT) technology with real-time IAQ monitoring systems has  tremendously gained momentum and popularity as interventions can be done based on the real-time sensor data and thus help in the IAQ improvement.   

==Improvement measures==

Indoor air quality can be addressed, achieved or maintained during the design of new buildings or as mitigating measures in existing buildings. A hierarchy of measures has been proposed by the Institute of Air Quality Management. It emphasises removing pollutant sources, reducing emissions from any remaining sources, disrupting pathways between sources and the people exposed, protecting people from exposure to pollutants, and removing people from areas with poor air quality.

A report assisted by the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance can support in the systematic investigation of individual health problems arising at indoor workplaces, and in the identification of practical solutions.

=== Source control ===
=== HVAC design ===


Environmentally sustainable design concepts include aspects of commercial and residential heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) technologies. Among several considerations, one of the topics attended to is the issue of indoor air quality throughout the design and construction stages of a building&#x27;s life.

One technique to reduce energy consumption while maintaining adequate air quality, is demand-controlled ventilation. Instead of setting throughput at a fixed air replacement rate, carbon dioxide sensors are used to control the rate dynamically, based on the emissions of actual building occupants.

One way of quantitatively ensuring the health of indoor air is by the frequency of effective turnover of interior air by replacement with outside air. In the UK, for example, classrooms are required to have 2.5 outdoor air changes per hour. In halls, gym, dining, and physiotherapy spaces, the ventilation should be sufficient to limit carbon dioxide to 1,500 ppm. In the US, ventilation in classrooms is based on the amount of outdoor air per occupant plus the amount of outdoor air per unit of floor area, not air changes per hour. Since carbon dioxide indoors comes from occupants and outdoor air, the adequacy of ventilation per occupant is indicated by the concentration indoors minus the concentration outdoors. The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains over 400 ppm (global average as of 2023). In classrooms, the requirements in the ASHRAE standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 air changes per hour, depending on the occupant density. As the occupants are not the only source of pollutants, outdoor air ventilation may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors.

When outdoor air is polluted, bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air.

The use of air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. Portable room air cleaners with HEPA filters can be used if ventilation is poor or outside air has high level of PM 2.5. Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the efficiency of the coils.

The use of trickle vents on windows is also valuable to maintain constant ventilation. They can help prevent mold and allergen build up in the home or workplace. They can also reduce the spread of some respiratory infections.

Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidity give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory problems.

The &quot;dew point temperature&quot; is an absolute measure of the moisture in air. Some facilities are being designed with dew points in the lower 50s °F, and some in the upper and lower 40s °F. Some facilities are being designed using desiccant wheels with gas-fired heaters to dry out the wheel enough to get the required dew points. On those systems, after the moisture is removed from the make-up air, a cooling coil is used to lower the temperature to the desired level.

Commercial buildings, and sometimes residential, are often kept under slightly positive air pressure relative to the outdoors to reduce infiltration. Limiting infiltration helps with moisture management and humidity control.

Dilution of indoor pollutants with outdoor air is effective to the extent that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high.

=== Effect of indoor plants ===
Houseplants together with the medium in which they are grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. The interest in using potted plants for removing VOCs was sparked by a 1989 NASA study conducted in sealed chambers designed to replicate the environment on space stations. However, these results suffered from poor replication and are not applicable to typical buildings, where outdoor-to-indoor air exchange already removes VOCs at a rate that could only be matched by the placement of 10–1000 plants/m2 of a building&#x27;s floor space.

Plants also appear to reduce airborne microbes and molds, and to increase humidity. However, the increased humidity can itself lead to increased levels of mold and even VOCs.

Since extremely high humidity is associated with increased mold growth, allergic responses, and respiratory responses, the presence of additional moisture from houseplants may not be desirable in all indoor settings if watering is done inappropriately.

==Institutional programs==

The topic of IAQ has become popular due to the greater awareness of health problems caused by mold and triggers to asthma and allergies.

In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed an &quot;IAQ Tools for Schools&quot; program to help improve the indoor environmental conditions in educational institutions. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducts Health Hazard Evaluations (HHEs) in workplaces at the request of employees, authorized representative of employees, or employers, to determine whether any substance normally found in the place of employment has potentially toxic effects, including indoor air quality.

A variety of scientists work in the field of indoor air quality, including chemists, physicists, mechanical engineers, biologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists, and computer scientists. Some of these professionals are certified by organizations such as the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the American Indoor Air Quality Council and the Indoor Environmental Air Quality Council.

In the UK, under the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Air Quality Expert Group considers current knowledge on indoor air quality and provides advice to government and devolved administration ministers.

At the international level, the International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate (ISIAQ), formed in 1991, organizes two major conferences, the Indoor Air and the Healthy Buildings series.

<text>Brazilian integralism () was a political movement in Brazil, created in October 1932. Founded and led by Plínio Salgado, a literary figure somewhat famous for his participation in the 1922 Modern Art Week, the movement had adopted some characteristics of European mass movements of those times, specifically of Italian fascism, but distanced itself from Nazism because Salgado himself did not support racism. He believed that every person of every race should unite under the Integralist flag. Despite the movement&#x27;s slogan &quot;Union of all races and all peoples&quot;, members and leaders like Gustavo Barroso held anti-Semitic views. The name of the party created to support its doctrine was Brazilian Integralist Action (, AIB). The reference to Integralism mirrored a traditionalist movement in Portugal, the Lusitanian Integralism. For its symbol, the AIB used a flag with a white disk on a royal blue background, with an uppercase sigma (Σ) in its center. (In mathematics, sigma indicates a discrete summation of terms, representing the &quot;integration&quot; of all societal elements towards the nation.)

==Character==
In its outward forms, Integralism was similar to European fascism: a green-shirted paramilitary organization with uniformed ranks, highly regimented street demonstrations, and rhetoric against Marxism and liberalism. However, it differed markedly from it in specific ideology: a prolific writer before turning political leader, Salgado interpreted human history at large as an opposition between &quot;materialism&quot;—understood by him as the normal operation of natural laws guided by blind necessity—and &quot;spiritualism&quot;: the belief in God, in the immortality of the soul, and in the conditioning of individual existence to superior, eternal goals. Salgado advocated, therefore, the harnessing of individual interest to values such as pity, self-donation and concern to others. For him, human history consisted of the eternal struggle of the human spirit against the laws of nature, as expressed by the atheism of modern society in the twin forms of liberalism and socialism—capitalist competition leading eventually to the merger of private capitals in a single state-owned economy. Thus the integralists favoured nationalism as a &quot;shared spiritual identity&quot;, in the context of a heterogeneous and tolerant nation influenced by Christian virtues—such virtues being concretely enforced by means of an authoritarian government enforcing compulsory political activity under the guidance of an acknowledged leader.

In particular, they drew support from military officers, especially in the Brazilian Navy.

Integralism being a mass movement, there were marked differences in ideology among its leaders under the influence of various international fascist and quasi-fascist contemporary movements, as in the issue of anti-Semitism. While Salgado was against it, Gustavo Barroso, the party&#x27;s chief doctrinaire after Salgado, was known for his militant antisemitic views, becoming notorious for being the author of the first and so far only Portuguese translation of &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;; he was also the author of various antisemitic works of his own (&quot;Judaism, Freemasonry and Communism&quot;; &quot;Sinagogues in São Paulo&quot;). This led to at least two serious ruptures in the movement: one in 1935 and the other, 1936, when Salgado almost renounced leadership of the movement.

One of the most important principles in an Integralist&#x27;s life was the &quot;Internal Revolution&quot;, or &quot;Revolution of the Self&quot;, through which a man was encouraged to stop thinking only for himself, and instead start to integrate into the idea of a giant integralist family—becoming one with the Homeland, while also leaving behind selfish and &quot;evil&quot; values.

==Attitudes of the Vargas dictatorship==
In the beginning of the 1930s, Brazil went through a strong wave of political radicalism. Following the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, the oligarchic First Brazilian Republic was overthrown and replaced by the new revolutionary government of Getúlio Vargas. The new government had a degree of support from workers because of the labor laws he introduced, and competed with the Brazilian Communist Party for working-class support. In the face of communist advances, and at the same time building on his intensive crackdown against the Brazilian left, Vargas turned to the integralist movement as a single mobilized base of right-wing support. With center-left factions excluded from the Vargas&#x27; coalition and the left crushed, Vargas progressively set out to co-opt the populist movement to attain the widespread support that allowed him eventually (in 1937) to proclaim his &quot;Estado Novo&quot;—a corporatist &quot;New State&quot;.

Integralism had a rapidly growing membership throughout Brazil by 1935, especially among German Brazilians and Italian Brazilians (approximately two million people), and began to fill this ideological void. In 1934, the Integralists targeted the communist movement of Luiz Carlos Prestes, mobilizing a conservative base of mass support that engaged in street brawls. In 1934, after Vargas&#x27; delicate alliance with labor disintegrated and formed his new alliance with the AIB, Brazil entered one of the most agitated periods in its political history. Brazil&#x27;s major cities began to resemble 1932–1933 Berlin with its street battles between the Communist Party of Germany and the Nazi Party. By mid-1935, Brazilian politics had been drastically destabilized.

==Crackdown and legacy==

When Vargas established full dictatorial powers under the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; in 1937, he turned against the integralist movement. Although AIB favored Vargas&#x27; hard right turn, Salgado was overly ambitious, with overt presidential aspirations that threatened Vargas&#x27; grip on power. In 1938, the Integralists made a last attempt at achieving power, attacking the Guanabara Palace during the night, but police and army troops arrived at the last minute, and the ensuing gunfight ended with around twenty casualties. This attempt was called the Integralist &quot;Pajama Putsch&quot;.

The AIB disintegrated after that 1938, and in 1945, when the Vargas dictatorship ended, Salgado founded the Party of Popular Representation (PRP), which maintained the ideology of Integralism, but without the uniforms, salutes, signals, and signs. The various political leaderships raised among Integralism dispersed into various ideological positions during subsequent political struggles. Some former members participated in the 1964 military coup that overthrew President João Goulart. Other former integralists associated later with the Left, such as Goulart&#x27;s foreign minister Santiago Dantas, and the Catholic bishop D. Hélder Câmara.

==Integralists and the military dictatorship (1964–1985)==
Integralists and former Integralists took a range of positions inside the military right-wing dictatorship that followed the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état. Plínio Salgado joined the ARENA, the pro-military party. Augusto Rademaker and Márcio Melo, former Integralists, were two of the three-member junta that briefly ruled Brazil in 1969, in the transition from the second military government of Artur da Costa e Silva to the third (that of Emílio Médici). Rademaker was also vice-president of the third military government. He was generally considered one of the most diehard rightists in the contemporary military top brass. Many former Integralists in the military occupied government posts in the second and third military administrations. On the other hand, Dom Hélder Câmara, also a former Integralista, operated at the time was the best-known opponent of the regime.

==Neo-integralism==

Today, two small remnant groups in Brazil uphold the strict integralist ideology: the &quot;&quot;Frente Integralista Brasileira&quot; (FIB) and the &quot;Movimento Integralista e Linearista Brasileiro&quot;&quot; (MIL-B). The FIB has close ties to Levy Fidelix&#x27;s Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB), and supported the successful Jair Bolsonaro 2018 presidential campaign in the second round of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election In 2021, FIB leaders joined Roberto Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Brazilian Labor Party&quot; (PTB). Previously, many integralists were involved in Enéas Carneiro&#x27;s Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order (PRONA), which dissolved in 2006.

On 26 December 2019, a group called the &quot;Popular Nationalist Insurgency Command of the Large Brazilian Integralist Family&quot; claimed responsibility for a firebombing of the headquarters of comedy group Porta dos Fundos in Rio de Janeiro.

On 30 December 2019, a member of the FIB and former Patriota and PRONA candidate for Congress, Paulo Fernando Melo da Costa, was appointed as a special advisor to Human Rights Minister Damares Alves in the Bolsonaro administration. Sara Winter, a former member of Brazilian FEMEN, who worked in the ministry as national coordinator of maternity policies, while a member of Femen, declared that she sympathized with the ideas of Plínio Salgado, referring to him as a &quot;defender of the country&quot;. Also in the Bolsonaro government, Sara was part of the 300 do Brasil group, which had armed members and preached anti-democratic actions like the return of Institutional Act Number Five. In her campaign for the Senate in the 2022 Brazilian general election in the Federal District, Damares Alves claimed to identify with Integralism.

<text>The tits, chickadees, and titmice constitute the Paridae, a large family of small passerine birds which occur mainly in the Northern Hemisphere and Africa. Most were formerly classified in the genus &quot;Parus&quot;.

Eurasian and African members of this family are referred to as &quot;tits&quot;, while North American species are called either &quot;chickadees&quot; (onomatopoeic, derived from their distinctive &quot;chick-a dee dee dee&quot; alarm call) or &quot;titmice&quot;. The name titmouse is recorded from the 14th century, composed of the Old English name for the bird, &quot;mase&quot; (Proto-Germanic &quot;*maison&quot;, Dutch &quot;mees&quot;, German &quot;Meise&quot;), and tit, denoting something small. The former spelling, &quot;titmose&quot;, was influenced by &quot;mouse&quot; in the 16th century. Emigrants to New Zealand presumably identified some of the superficially similar birds of the genus &quot;Petroica&quot; of the family Petroicidae, the Australian robins, as members of the tit family, giving them the title tomtit, although, in fact, they are not related.

These birds are mainly small, stocky, woodland species with short, stout bills. Some have crests. They range in length from . They are adaptable birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects. Many species live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed, and learn to take other foods.

==Description==
With the exception of the three monotypic genera &quot;Sylviparus&quot;, &quot;Melanochlora&quot;, and &quot;Pseudopodoces&quot;, the tits are extremely similar in appearance, and have been described as &quot;one of the most conservative avian families in terms of general morphology&quot;. The typical body length of adult members of the family is between in length; when the monotypic genera are added, this range is from . In weight, the family ranges from ; this contracts to when the three atypical genera are removed. The majority of the variation within the family is in plumage, and particularly colour.

The bills of the tits are generally short, varying between stout and fine, depending on diet. The more insectivorous species have finer bills, whereas those that consume more seeds have stouter bills. It is said that tits are evolving longer beaks to reach into bird feeders. The most aberrant bill of the family is possessed by Hume&#x27;s ground tit of Tibet and the Himalayas, which is long and decurved.

==Distribution and habitat==

The tits are a widespread family of birds, occurring over most of Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa. The genus &quot;Poecile&quot; occurs from Europe through Asia into North America, as far south as southern Mexico. American species in this genus are known as chickadees. Some species in this genus have quite large natural distributions; one, the grey-headed chickadee, is distributed from Scandinavia to Alaska and Canada. The majority of the tits in the genus &quot;Periparus&quot; are found in the southeastern portion of Asia. This includes two species endemic to the Philippines. The coal tit, also in this genus, is a much more widespread species, ranging from the British Isles and North Africa to Japan. The two crested tits of the genus &quot;Lophophanes&quot; have a disjunct distribution, with one species occurring in Europe and the other in central Asia.

The genus &quot;Baeolophus&quot; is endemic to North America. The genus &quot;Parus&quot; includes the great tit that ranges from Western Europe to Indonesia. &quot;Cyanistes&quot; has a European and Asian distribution (also into northern Africa), and the three remaining genera, &quot;Pseudopodoces&quot;, &quot;Sylviparus&quot;, and &quot;Melanochlora&quot;, are all restricted to Asia.

==Behaviour==
Tits are active, noisy, and social birds. They are territorial during the breeding season and often join mixed-species feeding flocks during the nonbreeding season. The tits are highly adaptable, and after the corvids (crows and jays) and parrots, amongst the most intelligent of all birds. Tits recognize the difference between species that are dangerous or harmless to them, by this they can protect each other or their families. These birds do this by mobbing or escaping, however they also avoid the nest when the predators are present in order to avoid their families to be seen.

===Fission–fusion society===
Fission–fusion society has been documented in a number of avian taxa including this one. In brief, that means flocks can split into smaller groups or individuals, and subsequently reunite.

===Vocalisations===

The tits make a variety of calls and songs. They are amongst the most vocal of all birds, calling continuously in most situations, so much so that they are only ever silent for specific reasons such as avoiding predators or when intruding on a rival&#x27;s territory. Quiet contact calls are made while feeding to facilitate cohesion with others in their social group. Other calls are used for signalling alarm—a well-known example being the &quot;chic-a-dee-dee&quot; of North American species in the genus &quot;Poecile&quot;, the call which gives them their local common name, the chickadee. The call also serves as a rallying call to summon others to mob and harass the predator. The number of &quot;dee&quot; syllables at the end of the call increases with the level of danger the predator poses.

===Diet and feeding===
The tits are generalist insectivores that consume a wide range of small insects and other invertebrates, particularly small defoliating caterpillars. They also consume seeds and nuts, particularly in the winter. One characteristic method of foraging in the family is hanging, where they inspect a branch or twig and leaves from all angles while hanging upside down to feed. In areas where numerous species of tit coexist, different species forage in different parts of the tree, their niche determined in no small way by their morphology; larger species forage on the ground, medium-sized species foraging on larger branches, and the smallest species on the ends of branches. Having obtained larger prey items or seeds, tits engage in hold-hammering, where they hold the item between their feet and hammer it with their bill until it opens. In this fashion, they can even open hazelnuts in around 20 minutes. A number of genera engage in food caching, hoarding supplies of food during the winter.

===Breeding===
Tits are cavity-nesting birds, typically using trees, although &quot;Pseudopodoces&quot; builds a nest on the ground. Most tree-nesting tits excavate their nests, and clutch sizes are generally large for altricial birds, ranging from usually two eggs in the rufous-vented tit of the Himalayas to as many as 10 to 14 in the blue tit of Europe. In favourable conditions, this species had laid as many as 19 eggs, which is the largest clutch of any altricial bird. Most tits are multibrooded, a necessary strategy to cope with either the harsh winters in which they reside in the Holarctic or the extremely erratic conditions of tropical Africa, where typically a single pair cannot find enough food to rear even one nestling and in drought years breeding is likely to be futile.

Many African tit species, along with &quot;Pseudopodoces&quot;, are cooperative breeders, and even pair-breeding parids are often highly social and maintain stable flocks throughout the nonbreeding season.

Tits also have a variety of methods for attracting mates, primarily through their intricate, bouncing mating dance. Only the blue tit is typically polygynous; all other species are generally monogamous. Courtship feeding is typical of pair-breeding tits to deal with the cost of rearing their large broods.

==Systematics==

Recently, the large &quot;Parus&quot; group has been gradually split into several genera (as indicated below), initially by North American ornithological authorities and later elsewhere. Whereas in the mid-1990s, only &quot;Pseudopodoces&quot;, &quot;Baeolophus&quot;, &quot;Melanochlora&quot;, and &quot;Sylviparus&quot; were considered well-supported by the available data as distinct from &quot;Parus&quot;. Today, this arrangement is considered paraphyletic as indicated by mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence analysis, and &quot;Parus&quot; is best restricted to the &quot;Parus major&quot;—&quot;Parus fasciiventer&quot; clade, and even the latter species&#x27; closest relatives might be considered a distinct genus.

In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the family Paridae is much enlarged to include related groups such as the penduline tits and long-tailed tits, but while the former are quite close to the tits and could conceivably be included in that family together with the stenostirid &quot;warblers&quot;, the long-tailed tits are not. Indeed, the yellow-browed tit and the sultan tit are possibly more distant to the tits than the penduline tits are. If the two current families are lumped into the Paridae, the tits would be a subfamily Parinae.

Alternatively, all tits—save the two monotypic genera discussed in the preceding section and possibly &quot;Cyanistes&quot;, but including Hume&#x27;s ground tit—could be lumped in &quot;Parus&quot;. In any case, four major clades of &quot;typical&quot; tits can be recognized: the dark-capped chickadees and their relatives (&quot;Poecile&quot; including &quot;Sittiparus&quot;), the long-crested &quot;Baeolophus&quot; and &quot;Lophophanes&quot; species, the usually tufted, white-cheeked &quot;Periparus&quot; (including &quot;Pardaliparus&quot;) with more subdued coloration and finally &quot;Parus sensu stricto&quot; (including &quot;Melaniparus&quot; and &quot;Machlolophus&quot;). Still, the interrelationship of these, as well as the relationships of many species within the clades, are not well-resolved at all; analysis of morphology and biogeography probably gives a more robust picture than the available molecular data.

Tits have settled North America twice, probably at some time during the Early-Mid Pliocene. The first were the ancestors of &quot;Baeolophus&quot;, with chickadees arriving somewhat later.

<text>John Marshall Stone (April 30, 1830March 26, 1900) was an American politician from Mississippi. A Democrat, he served longer as governor of that state than anyone else, from 1876 to 1882 and again from 1890 to 1896. He approved a new constitution in 1890 passed by the Democratic-dominated state legislature that disfranchised most African Americans, excluding them from the political system for more than 75 years.

== Early life ==
Born in Milan, Tennessee, Stone was the son of Asher and Judith Stone, natives of Virginia who were part of the migration to the west. He did not attend college since his family was fairly poor, but he studied a great deal and eventually taught school. He lived in Jacks Creek, Tennessee before moving to Tishomingo County, Mississippi in 1855. Stone became a station agent at Iuka when the Memphis and Charleston Railroad opened.

== American Civil War ==
With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Stone enlisted in the Confederate States Army that April. He commanded Company K of the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment and saw action in Virginia. In 1862, Stone was elected colonel of his regiment. Stone was highly commended by his division commander Maj. Gen. Henry Heth, and in 1864, he frequently commanded the brigade. In January 1865, he recruited in Mississippi and commanded local troops countering Stoneman&#x27;s 1865 Raid. He and his men were captured in North Carolina and imprisoned in Camp Chase, Ohio; later transferred to Johnson&#x27;s Island, Ohio.

== Political career ==

At the end of the war, Stone returned to Tishomingo County. He was elected mayor and treasurer. In 1869, he won a race to become state senator, winning re-election in 1873. State elections were marked by fraud and violence; the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group, worked to disrupt and suppress black voting and turned Republicans out of office. After Governor Adelbert Ames resigned in 1876, Stone, who was president pro tempore of the Mississippi State Senate at that time, served as the acting governor.

In the 1877 election, Stone won the governor&#x27;s office as a Democrat. In 1881 he was defeated for re-election by Robert Lowry. Stone became governor again after winning the 1889 election. The gubernatorial term was extended through 1896 by the new Mississippi Constitution of 1890.
== Later life ==
Following his term as governor, in 1899, Stone accepted a position as the 2nd President of Mississippi A&amp;M (now Mississippi State University) in Starkville. Stone died in Holly Springs, Mississippi, in 1900, at 69. He is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Iuka, Mississippi.

== Personal life ==
After the war, Stone married Mary G. Coman in 1872. The couple had two children who died young. They adopted three children of John&#x27;s brother and raised them as their own.

== Legacy and honors ==
* In 1916 Stone County, Mississippi, was named in his honor posthumously.
* Stone Boulevard at Mississippi State is named for him. 
* The John M. Stone Cotton Mill in Starkville was formerly named in his honor. However, it was renamed the E.E. Cooley Building after being purchased by Mississippi State University (MSU) in 1965. This building was used for many years to house the university&#x27;s physical plant. The building reopened in 2015 as an event center.

<doc id="219757" wikidata="Q269107" url="?curid=219757" title="Waxing">
<text>Waxing is the process of hair removal from the root by using a covering of a sticky substance, such as wax, to adhere to body hair, and then removing this covering and pulling out the hair from the follicle. New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different human hair growth cycle. Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic hair (called bikini waxing or intimate waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen, chest, knuckles, and feet. There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair.

== Types ==
Strip waxing (soft wax) is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin. A cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly, adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to the skin. The strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth, as parallel as possible to the skin to avoid trauma to the skin. This removes the wax along with the hair. There are different forms of strip waxing or soft waxing: heated, cold or pre-made strips. Unlike cold waxing, heated wax is spread easily over the skin. Cold waxing is thicker, which makes it more difficult to spread smoothly over the skin. Pre-made strips come with the wax on them, and they come in different sizes for different area uses.

Stripless wax (as opposed to strip wax) comprises both hard wax and film wax. Hard wax is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips. Film wax similarly so but is spread in a thin film. The wax then hardens when it cools, thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths or strips. This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin. Stripless wax does not adhere to the skin as much as strip wax does, thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard wax encapsulates the hair as it hardens. The stripless waxing method can also be less painful.

== Contraindications ==

The following factors are known to make those who are waxed more prone to &quot;skin lifting&quot;, where the top layer of skin is torn away during waxing treatment:

* Taking blood-thinning medications;
* Taking drugs for autoimmune diseases, including lupus;
* Taking prednisone or steroids;
* Taking retinoid, including over the counter retinols and prescription strength tretinoin 
* Psoriasis, eczema, or other chronic skin diseases;
* Recent sunburn;
* Recent cosmetic or reconstructive surgery;
* Recent laser skin treatment;
* Severe varicose leg veins;
* Rosacea or very sensitive skin;
* History of fever blisters or cold sores (waxing can cause a flare-up);
* Using Trevino, Tazaronene, or any other peeling agent;
* Recent surgical peel, microdermabrasion or chemical peel using glycolic, alpha hydroxy, salicylic acid, or other acid-based products.

There are many benefits to waxing versus other forms of hair removal. It is an effective method to remove large amounts of hair at one time. It is a long-lasting method, as hair in waxed areas will not grow back for two to eight weeks. When hair is shaved or removed by depilatory cream, the hair is removed at the surface rather than the hair root. Within a few days, the hair can reappear back at the surface. With these methods, hair tends to grow back in a rough stubble. Areas that are repeatedly waxed over long periods of time often exhibit regrowth that is softer.

There are many drawbacks of waxing as well. Waxing can be painful when the strip is removed from the skin. Although the pain is not long-lasting, it can be intense, particularly in sensitive areas. Another drawback to waxing is the expense: waxing is usually performed by a licensed esthetician and in some cases the cost can be high, depending on the area waxed and the number of sittings required. There are do-it-yourself waxing supplies, but they may be difficult to use on oneself on some areas on the body.

Another drawback of waxing is that some people experience ingrown hairs, red bumps, and minor bleeding. This is more likely to occur when waxing areas with thick hair, especially the first few times when follicles are strongest.

<text>The King&#x27;s Daughters ( , or in the spelling of the era) were the approximately 800 young French women who immigrated to New France between 1663 and 1673 as part of a program sponsored by King Louis XIV. The program was designed to boost New France&#x27;s population both by encouraging Frenchmen to move to the New World, and by promoting marriage, family formation, and the birth of French children in the colony. The term refers to those women and girls who were recruited by the government and whose travel to the colony was paid for by the king. They were also occasionally known as the King&#x27;s Wards.

== Origins ==

New France, at its start, was populated mostly by men: soldiers, fur traders, and missionary priests. Settlers began to develop farms and by the mid-17th century, there was a severe imbalance between single men and women in New France. The small number of female immigrants had to pay their own passage, and few single women wanted to leave home to move and settle in the harsh climate and conditions of New France. At the same time, officials noted the population growth of the competing English colonies, which had more families, and they worried about France&#x27;s ability to maintain its territorial claims in the New World.

To increase the French population and the number of families, the Intendant of New France, Jean Talon, proposed that the king sponsor passage of at least 500 women. The king agreed, and eventually, nearly twice the number were recruited. They were predominantly between the ages of 12 and 25, and many had to supply a letter of reference from their parish priest before they would be chosen for immigration to New France. They were intended to marry men in the colony in order to establish families and more farms.

Marguerite Bourgeoys was the first person to use the expression in her writings. A distinction was made between King&#x27;s Daughters, who were transported to New France and received a dowry at the king&#x27;s expense, and women who emigrated voluntarily using their own money. Other historians used chronological frameworks to determine who could be called a . Research by the historical demographer Yves Landry determines that there were in total about 770 to 850 who settled in New France between 1663 and 1673.

The title &quot;King&#x27;s Daughters&quot; was meant to imply state patronage, not royal or noble parentage; most of the women recruited were commoners of humble birth. As a , a woman received the king&#x27;s support in several ways. The king paid one hundred livres to the French East India Company for each woman&#x27;s crossing, as well as furnishing her trousseau. The Crown also paid a dowry for each woman; this was originally set at four hundred livres, but as the Treasury could not spare such an expense, many were simply paid in kind.

Those chosen to be among the and allowed to emigrate to New France were held to scrupulous standards, which were based on their &quot;moral calibre&quot; and whether they were physically fit enough to survive the hard work demanded by life as a colonist. The colonial officials sent several of the back to France because they were deemed below the standards set out by the king and the intendant of New France.

As was the case for most emigrants who went from France to New France, 80 per cent of the were from Paris, Normandy and the western regions. Almost half were from the Paris area, 16 per cent from Normandy and 13 per cent from western France. Most came from urban areas, with the and the Saint-Sulpice parish being big contributors.
Many were orphans with meagre personal possessions, and with a relatively low level of literacy. 
Socially, the young women came from different backgrounds but were all very poor. They might have been from an elite family that had lost its fortune, or from a large family with children &quot;to spare.&quot; Officials usually matched women of higher birth with officers or gentlemen living in the colony, sometimes in the hopes that the nobles would marry the young women and be encouraged to stay in Canada rather than return to France. A few women came from other European countries, including Germany, England, and Portugal. 

== Integration into New French society ==

The women disembarked in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal. After their arrival, their time to find husbands varied greatly. For some, it was as short as a few months, while others took two or three years before finding an appropriate husband. For the process of choosing a husband, and the marriage, most couples would officially get engaged in church, with their priest and witnesses present. Then, some couples went in front of the notary, to sign a marriage contract. Marriages were celebrated by the priest, usually in the woman&#x27;s parish of residence. While the marriage banns customarily were to be published three times before a wedding could take place, the colony&#x27;s need for women to marry quickly led to few having marriage banns announced. It is known that 737 of these were married in New France.

The marriage contracts represented a protection for the women, both in terms of financial security if anything were to happen to them or their husband, and in terms of having the liberty to annul the promise of marriage if the man they had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.

An early problem in recruitment was the women&#x27;s adjustment to the new agricultural life. As Saint Marie de L&#x27;Incarnation wrote, the were mostly town girls, and only a few knew how to do manual farm work. This problem remained but, in later years, more rural girls were recruited.

There were approximately 300 recruits who did not marry in New France. Some had a change of heart before embarking from the ports of Normandy and never left, while some died on the journey. Others returned to France to marry, and a few remained single.

===Integration in Ville-Marie===
Prior to the King&#x27;s Daughters, the women who immigrated to Ville-Marie, otherwise known as Montreal, had been recruited by the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal founded in 1641 in Paris. Amongst these women were Jeanne Mance and Marguerite Bourgeoys. When the first arrived in Montreal, they were taken in by Bourgeoys. Initially, there were no comfortable lodgings to receive them, but in 1668 Bourgeoys procured the Maison Saint-Gabriel, a large farmhouse in which to house them.

===End of recruitment and growth of the settlement===
The program was a resounding success. It was reported that in 1670, most of the girls who had arrived the previous year, 1669, were already pregnant and by 1671, a total of nearly 700 children were born to the . The colony was expected to gain population self-sufficiency soon afterward.

By the end of 1671, Talon suggested that it would not be necessary to sponsor the passage of girls for the next year, and the king accepted his advice. The migration briefly resumed in 1673, when the king sent 60 more girls at the request of Buade de Frontenac, the new governor, but that was the last under the Crown&#x27;s sponsorship. Of the approximately 835 marriages of immigrants in the colony during this period, 774 included a . By 1672, the population of New France had increased to 6,700, from 3,200 in 1663.

==Rumors and legends==

The idea that the were prostitutes has been a rumor ever since the inception of the program in the 17th century. It seems to have arisen from a couple of misconceptions, both contemporary and modern, about immigration to French colonies in the New World. The first of these, which took root long before the first emigrated, was that Canada was a penal colony. While there were two campaigns in the mid-17th century that involved the immigration of French criminals to Canada in exchange for their records being expunged, they were both short-lived. These programs resulted in little more than setting a precedent for viewing Canada as a place where those &quot;of questionable morality&quot; could be sent for one reason or another.

The popularization of the idea that the in particular were prostitutes can be traced to an account by the Baron de Lahontan of his time in New France; several earlier sources made the same assertion, including Saint-Amant, Tallement des Réaux, and Paul LeJeune. In his account, Lahontan refers to the as being &quot;of middling virtue&quot;, and wrote that they had emigrated in the hopes of religious absolution. As early as 1738, Claude Le Beau countered his portrayal in an account of his own journey to New France, as did Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix in his 1744 work.

Out of nearly 800 , only one, Catherine Guichelin, was charged with prostitution while living in Canada, after she was abandoned by her husband. She appeared before the Sovereign Council of New France under the charge of carrying out &quot;a scandalous life and prostitution&quot; on 19 August 1675. Her two children were &quot;adopted&quot; by friends, and she was banished from Quebec City. She was reported to have turned to prostitution after her husband, Nicholas Buteau, abandoned the family and returned to France. She later gave birth to many children out of wedlock. Guichelin had at least two marriage contracts cancelled. She also wed twice more after returning to Sorel, Quebec, then Montreal.

The ships carrying the would travel up the Saint Lawrence River, stopping first at Quebec City, then at Trois-Rivières, and lastly at Montreal. Because the prettiest of the girls would have the easiest time finding a husband, many of these immigrants settled in Quebec City, the first port of call.

<text>Calx is a substance formed from an ore or mineral that has been heated. Calx, especially of a metal, is now understood to be an oxide. The term is also sometimes used in older texts on artists&#x27; techniques to mean calcium oxide. 

According to the obsolete phlogiston theory, the calx was the true elemental substance that was left after phlogiston was driven out of it in the process of combustion.
==Etymology==
Calx is Latin for chalk or limestone, from the Greek χάλιξ (&quot;khaliks&quot;, “pebble”). (It is not to be confused with the Latin homonym meaning heelbone (or calcaneus in modern medical Latin), which has an entirely separate derivation.)

==In popular culture==
* UK electronic music artist Aphex Twin named four of his tracks after differently coloured calxes (green, yellow, blue and red).

<text>The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was a tilting high speed train developed by British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, for use on the West Coast Main Line (WCML). The WCML contains many curves, and the APT pioneered the concept of active tilting to address these, a feature that has since been copied on designs around the world. The experimental APT-E achieved a new British railway speed record on 10 August 1975 when it reached , only to be surpassed by the service prototype APT-P at in December 1979.

Development of the service prototypes dragged on, and by the late 1970s the design had been under construction for a decade and the trains were still not ready for service. The election of Margaret Thatcher brought matters to a head and she alluded to funding cuts for the project. Facing the possibility of cancellation, BR management decided to put the prototypes into service, with the first runs along the London–Glasgow route taking place in December 1981.

The problems were eventually solved and the trains quietly reintroduced in 1984 with much greater success. By this time the competing High Speed Train, powered by a conventional diesel engine and lacking the APT&#x27;s tilt and performance, had gone through development and testing at a rapid rate and was now forming the backbone of BR&#x27;s passenger service. All support for the APT project collapsed as anyone in authority distanced themselves from what was being derided as a failure. Plans for a production version, APT-S, were abandoned, and the three APT-Ps ran for just over a year before being withdrawn again over the winter of 1985/6. Two of the three sets were broken up, and parts of the third sent to the National Railway Museum where it joined the APT-E.

Despite the challenges faced by the APT, its design was highly influential and directly inspired other high-speed trains, such as the Pendolino. The extensive work on electrification carried out alongside the APT was effectively utilized in later non-tilting designs, including the British Rail Class 91. The APT’s tilting system was reintroduced on the West Coast Main Line with the British Rail Class 390, which was based on the Fiat Ferroviaria tilting train design and built by Alstom. However, certain features introduced by the APT, such as the hydrokinetic braking system, have not been widely adopted.

==Background==

=== British Rail Research Division ===
Following nationalisation of the UK&#x27;s railways in 1948, British Railways, as it was then known, faced significant reductions in passenger numbers as the motor car rapidly became more popular through the 1950s and 60s. By 1970, passenger numbers were roughly half what they had been immediately prior to World War II. In an attempt to maintain a level of profitability, the government commissioned a report that resulted in the abandonment of many lines as part of the 1963 &quot;Beeching Axe&quot;. In spite of this significant restructuring, the organisation was still built on lines that were pre-war, with routings dating into the 1800s. Maintaining the network created problems with derailments increasingly common.

In 1962, Dr. Sydney Jones was hired away from the weapons department at R.A.E. Farnborough with the eventual aim of having him take over as BR&#x27;s research lead from Colin Ingles, who retired in 1964. Looking into the derailment problem, they found that much of the problem could be traced to a problem known as hunting oscillation. This was well known in the railway world, but tended to happen only at high speeds. On the BR network, especially on freight cars with worn wheels, it was being seen at speeds as low as . Jones was convinced that hunting oscillation was an effect similar to the problem of aeroelastic flutter encountered in aerodynamics, and decided to hire someone from the aeronautics field to investigate it.

In October 1962, Alan Wickens was given the position. Wickens was a dynamics expert who had previously worked at Armstrong Whitworth on the Sea Slug missile and then for a period at Canadair in Montreal before returning to the UK and joining the Blue Steel missile project. When the follow-on Blue Steel II was cancelled in favour of the US designed Skybolt, Wickens left A. V. Roe because he &quot;saw the writing on the wall&quot;. He answered an ad for BR, and during the interview, he replied that he had no knowledge of, and little interest in, railway bogie design. It was later revealed this was the reason he was hired.

Over the next several years, Wickens&#x27; team carried out what is considered to be the most detailed study of the dynamics of steel wheels on rails ever conducted. Starting with incomplete work by F.W. Carter from 1930, the team studied conventional two-axle bogies and quickly discovered that, as Jones had suspected, the problem was dynamic instability. Out of this work came the concept of a critical speed at which point hunting would become a problem. This work was then extended to the unique two-axle bogieless car designs used on the BR freight network, where the problem was further modified by the dynamics of the entire vehicle.

Wickens concluded that a properly damped suspension system could eliminate the problem. The key realization was that the suspension had to be both vertical, as it had been in the past when based on leaf springs, but also horizontally to avoid small displacements triggering oscillation. Computers were used to simulate the motion and develop rules for how much damping would be needed to avoid the problem for any given speed. By 1964 this work had produced the first High Speed Freight Vehicle, HSFV-1, a bogieless freight car capable of travelling safely at speeds up to . The same work suggested there was no practical upper limit to the achievable speeds in terms of dynamics, and that any limitations on maximum performance would be due to other factors like traction or wear on the lines. Eventually a series of six HSFV designs would be tested until 1976, and the last, HSFV-6, entered service that year.

===Cant and tilting trains===
During this period, BR&#x27;s Passenger Business division produced a report suggesting rail could compete with road and air, but only if the trains ran faster. Studying the increase in ridership due to the introduction of the British Rail Class 55 &quot;Deltic&quot; engines on the East Coast Main Line, and the effects of electrification on the WCML which improved journey times 20 to 30%, they concluded that every increase in speed would result in a 1% increase in passengers. This basic rule was apparently proven in Japan, when the Tokyo-Osaka Shinkansen line was operating from 1964 to huge success.

The Shinkansen provided a smooth ride at speeds as high as by laying new lines dedicated to high speed travel. BR&#x27;s most used route, the WCML, had in the order of 6 million passengers a year between London and Manchester, a far cry from the Tokyo-Osaka&#x27;s 120 million. Funding for a new line for high speed use was highly unlikely given these passenger levels. This presented a problem for any sort of high-speed operation on the route because the existing line contained many turns and curves, and rounding these at high speed would cause lateral forces that would make walking difficult, and throw items off tables onto the floor.

The traditional solution to this problem is to tilt the rails into the turns, an effect known as &quot;superelevation&quot; or &quot;cant&quot;. This has the effect of making the lateral forces more inline with the floor, reducing sideways forces. Because larger amounts of cant are more difficult to construct and maintain, and also because of the need to account for slower-moving traffic or the possibility of a train coming to a stand within the curve (both of which cases would consequently experience a force to the inside of the curve, a condition known as &quot;cant excess&quot;), long experience had shown that the maximum amount of cant that could be applied to lines with mixed traffic was 6.5 degrees.

Given the curve radii typically encountered on the WCML, this meant that even with the maximum permissible amount of cant applied, speeds couldn&#x27;t be increased much above the range without once again experiencing excessive lateral forces. As the initial factor limiting speeds is &quot;not&quot; safety against derailing or overturning, but rather only passenger comfort, the solution to increasing speeds further is therefore having the train car bodies tilt as well – while this doesn&#x27;t influence the forces acting at the wheel-rail level, it keeps the lateral forces experienced inside the passenger compartment at a comfortable level even at further increased speeds.

Talgo introduced the first practical design for a tilting carriage in the late 1950s. This consisted of a single bogie placed between the train cars with the car bodies suspended from an A-frame centered on the bogie with a pivot near the top. When the train rounded a bend, the centrifugal forces caused the car body to swing out like a pendulum, reaching the proper tilt angle naturally. However, this system had a distinct delay between entering the curve and the body swinging out, and then swung past this angle and then oscillated briefly until settling at the right angle. When traversing a series of curves, like in a switchyard, it tended to swing about alarmingly. Although a number of semi-experimental designs of the 1970s made use of it, like the UAC TurboTrain, the concept was not widely used.

===APT&#x27;s origins===
In 1964, a number of BR&#x27;s formerly-dispersed research groups were organised into the new Derby Research Division. It was here that the final work on Wickens&#x27; HSFV was being developed. At first there was some argument about whether or not a high-speed train would be supported; in the aftermath of the 1963 Beeching Axe it was not clear what size of network the government was willing to support, and whether a new design should be aimed at higher-speed intercity service, where a new locomotive would be needed to replace the ageing Deltics anyway, or a simpler system for better performance in the suburbs.

In 1965, Wickens had hired an intern, Dutch engineer A.J. Ispeert, and had him do some early work on active tilt systems. These would replace the passive pendulum-like Talgo system with a system using hydraulic cylinders that would quickly drive the car to the proper angle and hold it there without any swinging. A major advantage for BR use was that the center of rotation could be through the middle of the car, instead of the top, meaning the total movement would fit within the smaller British loading gauge. Ispeert returned a report on the concept in August 1966.

Wickens noted that BR&#x27;s single-axle suspension system would have less drag at high speed, and that its lighter weight would make it more stable at high speeds than conventional dual-axle bogies. In November 1966 he wrote a report calling for a two-year programme to build and test a High Speed Passenger Vehicle, essentially an experimental car like HSFV-1 but for passenger use instead of freight. The original plans called for a single dummy body and two bogies to test the suspension and tilting system at high speed. They set the maximum tilt angle at 9 degrees, which could be added to any cant in the underlying railbed.

The design programme was organised under Mike Newman, while Alastair Gilchrist headed the research side. Newman noted that a single car was unlikely to answer practical questions like how the train would operate as a complete unit, and that a dummy body would not answer the question of whether the tilt mechanism could really be built under the floor without projecting into the cabin. Accordingly, later that same November, Newman and Wickens drew up plans for a complete experimental train with the design goal to be not only to study the tilt system, but do so on actual lines.

Wickens took the plans to Sydney Jones, who immediately took up the idea. They set the performance goal at the nicely rounded figure of . In keeping with BR management goals to provide quicker travel times rather than just faster speeds, they also required the train to round corners 40% faster. They named the proposal the Advanced Passenger Train. Jones took the proposal to the BR chairman, Stanley Raymond, who liked the idea. However, the board was unable to provide enough funding to develop it, and encouraged Jones to approach the Ministry of Transport for additional funding.

Jones did so, and spent the next two years walking the corridors of Whitehall when one civil servant after another agreed that it was a great idea but that it was really the job of someone else to approve it. In spite of being repeatedly put off, Jones persisted, especially with Government Chief Scientist, Solly Zuckerman, to arrange a stable funding system for the entire topic of railway research. This was finalised as the Joint Programme between the Ministry of Transport and the British Railways Board, sharing the costs 50:50. The Programme would run sixteen years from January 1969 to March 1985. The first two programmes were APT and the Train Control Project.

===Finalising the design===
Another of Jones&#x27; many goals for the APT was that it would not cause additional wear on the lines. Instantaneous loads on the railbed vary with the square of speed, so a faster train would greatly increase road wear. Offsetting this effect required the train to meet stringent weight limits, and eliminated the possibility of using conventional diesel engines, which were simply too heavy. The team selected gas turbine power as the solution, initially considering the Rolls-Royce Dart.

When the funding was secured a number of design notes were still not finalised, so the timeline was stretched into July 1971 to provide extra time for the project definition stage. By May 1969 these issues had been decided and the final design emerged. The experimental train would have four cars; two power cars placed at either end, and two passenger cars between them filled with experimental measurement and recording systems. During the time Jones was arranging funding, an experimental engine built by Leyland for trucks became available, which was designed to be much less expensive. The Dart was dropped, and power would be supplied by four Leyland 2S/350 gas turbines in each power car, along with a fifth turbine connected to a generator to power the equipment in the passenger cars. During the testing period the engines were progressively upgraded to .

After many months studying various transmission systems, with time on the definition phase ending they finally decided to use an electric transmission, like a diesel-electric locomotive. Finally, due to schedule pressure, it was decided not to use a single articulated bogie between the cars, and two conventional bogies would be used on each car. Jim Wildhamer, recently hired from Westland Helicopters, designed a space-frame body for the power cars based on welded steel tube instead of the semi-monocoque construction used on the passenger cars.

Contracts for the various parts of the design were sent out in July 1969. Hawker Siddeley Dynamics won the contract for the suspensions and braking systems, GEC and English Electric won the contract for the trailer cars, and by this time Leyland had already been selected for the engines. Over time a number of these contracts were withdrawn and the teams took the design in-house, cancelling the suspensions contract with Hawker Siddeley in February 1970. Design of the bogies was taken over with the physical construction contracted to British Rail Engineering, while the power car construction was let to Metro-Cammell.

While this work was underway, work on an experiential facility for the design also started. Sited behind the main offices at the Derby labs, Kelvin House, the new facilities included a roller rig for testing the engines, a brake dynamometer and various test rigs for testing the suspension and tilt systems. The new lab was opened on 26 October 1970. Additionally, a section of track between Melton Mowbray and Edwalton was purchased as a test track. This was originally the main line to Nottingham, but now redundant after the Beeching Axe. This contained a straight section, many curves, and several tight tunnels that would be useful for aerodynamics tests. A set of maintenance buildings was built along this line at Old Dalby, and the line as a whole became known as the Old Dalby Test Track.

===POP===
Although construction of the train was relatively straightforward, a number of more serious problems appeared in the power and control systems. Thus the decision was made to build two additional power cars as unfinished frameworks with no power. These cars would instead be hauled by conventional locomotives to provide data on the tilting and braking systems as well as the dynamics of the vehicles. A contract for the additional two cars was sent out on 14 April 1970, and ran for the first time in September 1971. The name &quot;POP&quot; was assigned, an acronym for &quot;power-zero-power&quot;, indicating the two power car layout with no passenger cars in the middle.

The selection of a space frame design for the power cars turned out to be fortunate, as during construction the engineers concluded that the packaging of the various elements within the car would render it dynamically unstable. They needed more room to spread the parts out, so the decision was made to roughly double the length of the power cars. This turned out to be easy to do; the frameworks already under construction at Metro-Cammell simply had additional sections of steel tube inserted and construction was barely affected.

The POP cars were skinless, topped with a space frame holding ballast to simulate the various parts of the prospective design. The &quot;POP&quot; acronym was soon rendered inaccurate when a passenger car was added to make a three-car train, at which time the power cars were also given bodies. The POP underwent a number of changes, notably trialling different bogie designs, over its lifetime.

===APT-E===

While POP was proving the basic concepts, construction of the test train continued at the Derby lab. The set was sufficiently complete by late 1971 for an official naming ceremony, where it became the APT-E (for Experimental). It made its first low-speed run from Derby to Duffield on 25 July 1972. Upon reaching Duffield, the ASLEF union immediately &quot;blacked&quot; it, forbidding their members from doing any work involving the train. Their complaint was that the APT-E had a single operator&#x27;s chair, which they took as evidence that BR was moving to single operator trains. A friendly inspector helped the team move the train back to Derby at night. This resulted in a one-day national strike that cost more than the entire APT-E project.

By this point the POP had demonstrated a number of problems, and the engineers took the opportunity to start a major overhaul of the design. The main problem was the design of the non-driven bogies, which were not stable and could not be used for high speed runs. One power car was retained at the lab while the other and the two passenger cars were sent to the nearby Derby Works for modification. The main changes were to stiffen the power cars and replace the suspect bogies with a version of the powered bogie with the motors removed. Other changes included the removal of the ceramic recuperators from the turbines for reliability reasons, although this dramatically increased fuel use, and the addition of a small seating area to the passenger car for VIP use.

Contract negotiations over high speed rail had concluded in the summer of 1973, just in time for the modified three-car APT-E to emerge from the shop in August 1973. The train then started a testing series lasting eight months, covering details of the suspension, braking, curve performance and drag. However, reliability was a serious problem and it returned to the shops for a second overhaul in March 1974. Among the many changes for this round was the switching of the turbines formerly dedicated to power delivery for the passenger cars to add additional power to the traction motors, while at the same time replacing all of the turbines with an upgraded version, improving total power per car from . Other changes included new motor bearings and the return and similar modification of the second power car, formerly used at the lab.

The rebuilt four car train returned to service in June 1974. On 10 August 1975 it hit on the Western Region between Swindon and Reading, setting the UK record. It then set the route record from Leicester to London St. Pancras in 58 minutes 30 seconds on 30 October 1975, at an average speed of just over through this twisty route. It was also tested extensively on the Midland Main Line out of St. Pancras and on the Old Dalby Test Track, where in January 1976 it attained a speed of .

APT-E testing ended in 1976, and the single train was sent directly to the National Railway Museum in York on 11 June 1976. During its testing it covered approximately , ending a career that is considered a success, but the train could not be said to have been extensively tested; in three years it covered less distance than the average family car would in that period. In comparison, the first TGV prototype, TGV 001, also powered by gas turbines, covered between 1972 and 1976.

===Move to electrification===
While APT-E was still under construction, the team was well into the design of a production version. Jones found an ally in Graham Calder, who had been promoted to become BR&#x27;s chief mechanical engineer (CME) in 1971. At the time they envisioned building two new experimental trains; one was essentially a stretched version of the APT-E with turbine power, and the other was similar, but powered by overhead electrical lines via pantograph (pan).

As data flowed in from the POP and APT-E, a number of changes to the design were being made. Among the more problematic changes was Leyland&#x27;s exit from the turbine market, having concluded that the concept of a turbine powered truck was not economically feasible. The company agreed to continue supporting the project anyway, including the release of a more powerful version, but made it clear a production design would have to find another solution. In November 1972, the plans changed to build four electric versions for operation on the WCML, and another two turbine versions. From that point the turbine versions fell progressively further behind, and were eventually cancelled.

This may have been a blessing in disguise; the 1973 oil crisis caused fuel prices to rise as much as three times, and turbine engines were notoriously thirsty; the TurboTrain used between 50 and 100% more fuel than conventional sets running on the same routes. Leyland&#x27;s use of a recuperator improved this considerably, but proved a maintenance problem.

===Design review===
With the decision to move primarily to electrification made in November 1972, Jones began building a larger management team to carry the design forward to service. This resulted in the April 1973 transfer of the design from the research division to the Office of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer. A review was carried out by a joint team from the two divisions, led by David Boocock.

As a result of this review a number of additional changes were made to the design. A major problem was the recent discovery that the overhead lines on the WCML were subject to the creation of large waves in the lines at speeds over . This was not a problem for two trains following each other with a spacing of several kilometers, but was a serious problem for a single train with pantographs at both ends. The obvious solution was to use a single pantograph at the front or back and then run the power between the cars, but this was outlawed by concerns over the presence of 25 kV power on the passenger cars.

Some consideration was given to placing both engines back-to-back at one end of the train, but concerns were raised over excessive buckling forces when pushing the train at high speeds with the tilt feature active. So, finally, the design team chose to place the engines back-to-back in the centre of the train. The two engines would be identical and both would carry a pantograph to pick up power, but in normal operation only the rear of the two engines would raise its pantograph, and the other engine would be fed power through a coupling along the roof. Power was converted to direct current by ASEA thyristors, supplying four DC traction motors mounted in each power car. The traction motors were moved from the bogies to inside the car body, thereby reducing unsprung weight. The motors transmitted their power through internal gearboxes, cardan shafts and quill final drives.

Other changes suggested by experience on APT-E included changes to the vertical suspension from conventional hydraulic shock absorbers to air bags, which would both improve the ride quality and have lower maintenance requirements. For service reasons, the power cars were redesigned to have their own bogies in a Bo-Bo arrangement, so they could be easily removed from the train, unlike the former articulated design that connected adjacent cars together and made it difficult to split the train apart. The passenger cars retained the articulated design, but a number of changes were made due to experience on APT-E. Finally, a system that would cause the tilt system to fail into the upright position was desired, as APT-E had failed into a tilted position on several occasions.

As part of the same review, the team noticed that a slight reduction in maximum speed would greatly simplify a number of design points, and eliminated the need for the hydrokinetic brakes. However, the decision was made to go ahead with the original specification in order to provide the maximum possible speed. The government agreed to pay 80% of the cost of eight trains.

===HST vs. APT===
It was during this time that other groups within BR began to agitate against APT, saying it was simply too large a step to make in a single design. They proposed building a much simpler design, powered by conventional diesels and lacking tilt, but capable of speeds of up to and able to run anywhere on the BR network. This emerged in 1970 as the High Speed Train (HST), and development proceeded rapidly.

As the APT programme continued, management began infighting. Experienced engineering resources were withheld from the APT project, using them instead to press ahead as swiftly as possible with what they saw as a conventional rival to APT. As it appeared the HST would be a relatively sure bet, BR&#x27;s board of directors dithered on the APT project, eventually cutting the number of trains to four. This was later cut to three by the government in a 1974 round of budget cuts.

===APT-P===


Although the centre-motor layout was the simplest in terms of solving the immediate technical problems, it would cause significant problems in operational terms. There was a passage through the power cars that connected the two-halves of the train, but it was noisy, cramped and not permitted for passengers. Instead, each end of the train now required its own dining car and similar facilities. The split design also presented problems in the stations, where only the two ends of the platforms could now be used, whereas normal equipment could park with the locomotives off the end of the platform.

Although all auxiliary equipment such as lighting, air conditioning and air compressors was powered by motor alternators driven from the 25 kV overhead line, it was recognised that if there were a power failure, conditions in the passenger vehicles would quickly become unbearable and even unsafe. Each driving van trailer i.e. the leading and trailing vehicles, was equipped with a diesel-alternator generator capable of supplying the minimum requirement of auxiliary power. The diesel-alternators were started using air motors powered from the train&#x27;s air system, since the APT carried few batteries.

The APT was designed for faster running than existing trains on the same track. At the APT&#x27;s design speeds, it was not possible for the operator to read the speed limits on trackside signs in time to slow down if needed. Instead, a new system using a transponder-based cab display was introduced called &quot;C-APT&quot;. A radio signal from the train caused a track-mounted transponder to return the local speed limit. These sealed, unpowered transponders were placed at intervals of no more than 1 km. Approaching speed restrictions were provided at the appropriate distance, along with an audible alert; failure to acknowledge these alerts would result in an automatic brake application. C-APT was driven by a redundant onboard computer system using Intel 4004 microprocessors. The track units were essentially the same as the modern French Balise beacons.

The hydrokinetic brake system was successful and reliable on the APT-E and was retained for the APT-P with a number of design improvements from the lessons learnt on APT-E. However, as an energy-cutting measure, the hydraulically actuated friction brakes used for low speed were modified to be fed by a passive hydraulic intensifier rather than a hydraulic power pack.

===Service testing===
Although APT-P used much of the technology developed on the APT-E, construction of the first APT-P was delayed several times. The first power car was delivered from the Derby locomotive works in June 1977, and the first passenger cars on 7 June 1978, a year late. The first complete train was not ready until May 1979. It entered testing soon after, and set the UK speed record at in December 1979, a record that stood until beaten by a Class 373 Eurostar in July 2003. Two additional examples were delivered, each with minor changes, one in late 1979, and the last in 1980. Initially proposed in the 1960s, and given the go-ahead in the early 1970s, the design was now significantly late.

Long delays in the production of the prototype meant that the brake units had to be stored for an extended period before being installed. The change from oil to water-glycol mix required the cylinders to be covered internally with an anti-corrosion coating, which broke down during storage. In testing the cylinders repeatedly failed, and the loss of pressure caused the train to take nearly as long to slow from 25 mph to a standstill as it did to slow from 125 mph to 25 mph. During commissioning, because of this and other development issues, every axle on the trains was modified and exchanged.

The compressed air systems that actuated the brakes and powered the doors and other moving parts was another source of problems. The air piping would normally be run in such a way that there were natural low points where water condensing out of the air would collect and could be removed. On APT these runs were tortuous, and resulted in numerous points where the water would collect, and in cold weather, freeze. The commissioning team found a Westinghouse designed solution that would eliminate the water being produced by the compressors, but the design team would not accept the solution. They stated that the problem would not occur with a full train formation, as opposed to the shorter formation used in commissioning.

Finally, it was only discovered at the APT-P commissioning stage that parts of the WCML had been built in such a way that, if two APT-P trains with their tilt systems failed and the carriages stuck in the inward tilted position met, they would strike one another. The railway had not been built with tilting trains in mind, and the dynamic envelopes were too small for a tilted APT. The effect was not seen with conventional trains since, without tilt, their movements stayed well within the dynamic envelope.

Adding to the problems, in 1980 another reorganisation resulted in the disbanding of the APT team, leaving responsibility for the project spread across several divisions.

==In service==

===Queasy rider===
While the commissioning team continued to report, and solve, problems in the APT design, BR management was under increasing pressure from the press. By the early 1980s the project had been running for over a decade and the trains were still not in service. &quot;Private Eye&quot; lampooned it with a timetable proclaiming &quot;The APT arriving at Platform 4 is fifteen years late&quot;. Press pressure led to political pressure which led to management pressure, and the APT team was told to put the train into operation in spite of its ongoing problems.

On 7 December 1981 the press was invited aboard APT for its first official run from Glasgow to London, during which it set a schedule record at 4 hours 15 minutes. However, press reports focused on a distinct sickening sensation from the tilt system, and nicknamed APT the &quot;queasy rider&quot;. They also reported that the stewardess, Marie Docherty, suggested the solution was to &quot;just stand with your feet apart.&quot; A BR engineer suggested that the reporters were simply too drunk on BR&#x27;s free alcohol. On its return trip from London the next day, one of the coaches became stuck in a rotated position when the tilt system failed, and this was heavily reported in the press. Two days later, the temperature dipped and the water in the hydrokinetic brakes froze, forcing the train to end service in Crewe.

APT became the focus of a storm of negative press reporting. When it emerged that only two of the three APT-Ps were in operation and the third would be out of service for overhaul and maintenance, the press dubbed it the &quot;Accident Prone Train&quot;. BR also ran a second train 15 minutes behind it in case it failed, and since the train was mixed among existing traffic, its speed was limited to 125 mph instead of its full speed.

BR, desperate for some good publicity, hired former Blue Peter presenter Peter Purves to make the journey from Glasgow. On arrival at Euston, Purves said that he had had an &quot;excellent breakfast in the most delightful surroundings&quot;, and when asked about the train, said &quot;it&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s quiet, and an altogether delightful experience.&quot; However, as he said this, a slight shudder was visible, and the sound of rattling dishes could be heard.

===Further development===
In 1981, BR hired the consulting firm Ford &amp; Dain Partners to produce a report on the APT project and make any suggestions to improve it. It produced an interim report in November 1981, and a final version that December. Their reports first suggested that the technical aspects of the design were largely complete, although they drew attention to the braking system, but that the management structure was a serious problem and there had to be a single manager in charge of the entire project. This resulted in the appointment of John Mitchell to the position of manager of the APT. Matters immediately improved.

Among the improvements was a fix for the motion sickness being experienced by passengers. The commissioning team had been well aware of this problem before it entered service, but this was not mentioned to the press when it was noticed on the public runs. The problem was due to two effects. One was that the control system did not respond instantly, so the cars tended to not respond when the curve first started, and then reacted rapidly to make up for this lag. The fix for this was to take information on the tilt from the car in front, giving the system the slight time advantage it needed. The other problem was similar to sea sickness, but in reverse. Sea sickness is caused when the body&#x27;s equilibrioception system can feel movement, but inside a closed room this movement cannot be seen. On APT, one could easily see the tilting as the train entered turns, but there was no perception of this motion. The result was the same, a confusion between the visual and the equilibrioception system. The solution was almost trivial; slightly reducing the amount of tilt to be deliberately less than needed resulted in a small amount of leftover centrifugal force that was perceived by the equilibrioception system as being perfectly natural, which proved to cure the effect.

This also led to a further embarrassing discovery. The work that suggested the amount of tilt needed to reduce the lateral forces to acceptable levels was eventually traced to a short series of studies carried out by a steam train on a branch line in northern Wales in 1949. A series of updated studies carried out in 1983 demonstrated less tilt was needed, about six degrees. This was within the range possible through superelevation, which suggested tilting might not be needed at all.

===Re-entry, demise===
The APT-P trains were quietly reintroduced into service in mid-1984, but not mentioned as such on any of the timetables; passengers would find out if they were taking APT only when it arrived at the platform. These trains proved to work well, the problems having apparently been corrected. However, the political and managerial will to continue the project and build the projected 140 mph capable APT-S production vehicles had evaporated.

Meanwhile, HST entered service as the InterCity 125 in 1976 and proved to be an all-round success. Its diesel operation and slightly lower speeds also meant it could operate on more of BR&#x27;s network. Pressure to abandon APT in favour of HST was continual. Supporters of the APT were increasingly isolated, and the system was removed from service in the winter of 1985/6. This was made formal in 1987, when the trains were broken up and sent to museums.

One APT-P set was kept at Glasgow Shields depot and found use once or twice as an EMU to take journalists from Glasgow Central to Anderston railway station and back, for the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. A second APT-P was stored in a siding behind Crewe Works. The Glasgow APT-P and the third APT-P were scrapped without publicity.

==Examination==
The failure of the APT project saw extensive reporting in the 1980s, and has remained a topic of some discussion since then. Writers generally agree that the technical aspects of the design were largely solved by the time of their second service introduction, and put most of the blame for the delays on the shifting management structures and infighting within BR between APT and HST. There have also been concerns that carrying out development within BR was a major problem of its own, because this meant their industrial partners had no buy-in and their years of practical experience were being ignored.

The development timeline is also a topic of considerable discussion. In comparison, the Canadian LRC train began development at the same time as APT, developed a unique active tilting system of its own, and entered production in the late 1970s. Like APT, LRC also faced teething problems that took some time before they were solved, and was subject to some press chiding over these failures. Unlike APT, LRC had no competition and management was in a hurry to remove the Turbo from service. The system was given the time it needed to mature with no serious possibility of cancellation.

The slow pace of APT development has been blamed on the shoestring budget of £50 million over 15 years, although the press of the era dismissed this as too high. This number has been compared to the roughly £100 million spent by British Leyland to develop the Austin Mini Metro, a project that was technically trivial in comparison to APT.

==Legacy==
Alan Williams notes that work continued on a new variant, the APT-U (APT-Update). This was essentially APT-P with the tilt system made optional and the engines repositioned at either end of the train with power couplings running between them. That project was later retitled InterCity 225 (IC225), perhaps to distance it from the bad publicity surrounding the APT-P. The Mark 4 coach design that was introduced as part of the new IC225 sets for the East Coast Main Line electrification allowed the retrofitting of the tilt mechanism, although this was never implemented. The Class 91 locomotives that power the IC225s had design features &quot;imported wholesale&quot; from the APT-P power cars, including body- rather than bogie-mounted traction motors to reduce unsprung load, and having the transformer below rather than on top of the underframe to reduce the centre of gravity. Unlike the APT-P power cars, though, they were never intended to tilt.
In 1976 Fiat Ferroviaria built the ETR 401 trainset, a tilting train using an active system with 10 degrees of tilting that used gyroscopes to detect the corner in its early phases in order to have a more punctual and comfortable inclination: this is why the FIAT project has been successful since the &#x27;70s. In 1982 FIAT bought some APT patents that were used to improve their technology for the ETR 450 trainsets.

The introduction of the Squadron fleet designated APT-S did not occur as had been originally envisaged. The APT project succumbed to an insufficient political will in the United Kingdom to persist in solving the teething difficulties experienced with the many immature technologies necessary for a groundbreaking project of this nature. The decision not to proceed was made against a backdrop of negative public perceptions shaped by media coverage of the time. The APT is acknowledged as a milestone in the development of the current generation of tilting high speed trains. 25 years later on an upgraded infrastructure the Class 390 Pendolinos now match the APT&#x27;s scheduled timings. The London to Glasgow route by APT (1980/81 timetable) was 4hrs 10min, the same time as the fastest Pendolino timing (December 2008 timetable).

In 2006, on a one off non-stop run for charity, a Pendolino completed the Glasgow to London journey in 3hrs 55min, whereas the APT completed the opposite London to Glasgow journey in 3hrs 52min in 1984.

On 17 June 2021, a Pendolino named Royal Scot and operated by Avanti West Coast ran an attempt to beat the record but fell short of the record time by only 21 seconds. The nine-carriage train travelled non-stop at an average speed of 103 mph on the 401-mile route.

Continued analysis of the data collected during the project led to a better understanding of the causes of track wear and the need to reduce unsprung mass rather than reduce the overall weight of the carriage. This led to the development of the BREL P3/T3 for the British Rail Class 365 and British Rail Class 465, which among other improvements featured smaller radius wheels. BREL further developed the concept to produce the Advanced Suburban Bogie which was a factor in ABB acquisition of BREL. 

==APT today==

The APT-E unit is now owned by the National Railway Museum and is on display at its &quot;Locomotion&quot; museum at Shildon in County Durham. An APT-P unit is now on display at Crewe Heritage Centre and can be seen from trains passing on the adjacent West Coast Main Line along with APT-P power car number 49006 which arrived in March 2018 after seven years at the Electric Railway Museum near Coventry.

During special events, the driving trailer 370003 offers a &quot;tilt&quot; experience which involves tilting the coach when it is static.

<doc id="219779" wikidata="Q2903340" url="?curid=219779" title="Bill Richmond">
<text>Bill Richmond (5 August 1763 – 28 December 1829) was a British boxer, born into slavery in Richmondtown, New York. Although born in Colonial America, he lived for the majority of his life in England, where all his boxing contests took place. Richmond went to England in 1777, where he had his education paid for. He then apprenticed as a cabinetmaker in York.

In the early 1790s, Richmond married a local English woman, whose name was probably Mary Dunwick, in a marriage recorded in Wakefield on 29 June 1791. Richmond and his wife had several children.

According to boxing writer Pierce Egan, the well-dressed, literate, and self-confident Richmond came on the receiving end of racist attitudes in Yorkshire. Egan described several brawls involving Richmond because of insults. One brawl occurred after someone labeled Richmond a &quot;black devil&quot; for being with a white woman—probably a reference to Richmond&#x27;s wife.

According to Egan, Richmond fought and won five boxing matches in Yorkshire, defeating George &quot;Dockey&quot; Moore, two unnamed soldiers, one unnamed blacksmith and Frank Myers.

==Early life==
Bill Richmond was enslaved at birth by the Rev. Richard Charlton in Richmondtown on Staten Island, New York on 5 August 1763. A commander of the British forces in New York during the American War of Independence, Lord Percy, witnessed teenage Richmond in a tavern brawl involving British soldiers. Percy subsequently arranged fights with other British soldiers for the entertainment of his guests. In 1777, Percy arranged for Richmond&#x27;s freedom from Charlton, transportation to northern England, literacy education, and an apprenticeship with a cabinet maker in Yorkshire. He met his wife, Mary, while a cabinet-maker in Yorkshire. The two moved to London, where Richmond started boxing in his forties.

By 1795, Richmond and his family had moved to London. He became an employee and household member of Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford, a British peer and naval officer. A boxing enthusiast, Pitt may have received boxing and gymnastic instruction from Richmond. Pitt and Richmond visited several prize fights together.

==Boxing career==
===Richmond versus Maddox===
On 23 January 1804, Pitt and Richmond attended a boxing match featuring experienced boxer George Maddox. After Maddox won the bout, Richmond spontaneously challenged Maddox to a fight, which Maddox accepted. When the fight took place, Maddox defeated Richmond in nine rounds.

After Pitt&#x27;s death in a duel on 11 March 1804, Richmond left the household and returned to boxing. He began training and seconding other fighters and was soon a regular attendee at the Fives Court, London&#x27;s leading pugilistic exhibition venue on St Martin&#x27;s Street in Westminster.

===Richmond versus Cribb===
By 1805, Richmond had defeated the Jewish boxer Youssop and Jack Holmes. These wins gave Richmond the opportunity to challenge the famous Tom Cribb to a fight. During the ensuing bout, Cribb and Richmond&#x27;s counter-punching styles resulted in what observers considered a &quot;dull bout&quot;. Cribb won, leaving Richmond in tears. The contest solidified a grudge between the two men that would last years.

===Richmond versus Maddox II===
In 1808, Richmond returned to boxing. After several quick wins, he secured a rematch with George Maddox. The contest, in August 1809, demonstrated Richmond&#x27;s mastery of &quot;boxing on the retreat&quot;. He battered Maddox mercilessly, winning the bout. A spectator, William Windham, MP, later argued both boxers demonstrated skill and bravery as impressive as that displayed by British troops in their triumph that year at the Battle of Talavera.

===Molineaux versus Cribb I and II===

Richmond&#x27;s winnings allowed him to buy the Horse and Dolphin pub in St Martin&#x27;s Street near Leicester Square in London. It was at the pub that Richmond probably met Tom Molineaux, another former American slave. Richmond immediately saw Molineaux&#x27;s potential as a boxer, and decided to put aside his own boxing career and to train Molineaux. Their goal was to challenge Cribb, now the national champion. With Richmond as his trainer, Molineaux decisively won two fights, then challenged Cribb.

In December 1810, Cribb and Molineaux fought at Copthall Common in East Grinstead, Sussex. It was an epic contest, and one of the most controversial bouts in boxing history—Cribb won, barely, amid the chaos of a ring invasion and whisperings of a long count that had allowed the champion longer than the allowable 30 seconds to recover in between rounds. Molineaux, many maintained, had been cheated.

Historians disagree about whether the alleged bias shown to Cribb was motivated by Molineaux&#x27;s race or fears on the part of Cribb&#x27;s backers that they would lose their wagers. Certainly, before the fight there was nervousness about the prospect of a Molineaux victory, with the &quot;Chester Chronicle&quot; reporting that &quot;many of the noble patronizers [&quot;sic&quot;] of this accomplished art, begin to be alarmed, lest, to the eternal dishonour of our country, a negro should become the Champion of England!&quot;

In October 1811, Molineaux and Cribb fought a rematch, which Cribb won easily. After the match, Molineaux fired Richmond as his trainer.

===Richmond versus Shelton===
Having lost money brokering and betting on the Molineaux-Cribb fight, Richmond had to sell the Horse and Dolphin and rebuild his fortune. He became a member of the Pugilistic Society, the sport&#x27;s first governing body in the United Kingdom. In May 1814, at the age of 50, Richmond fought Jack Davis and won.

The victory over Davis encouraged Richmond to accept a fight with Tom Shelton, a respected contender who was about half his age. After suffering a horrendous eye injury early on, Richmond beat Shelton down after 23 rounds. When the fight was over, Richmond jumped over the ropes with joy to celebrate the defining moment of his career. &quot;Impetuous men must not fight Richmond,&quot; Egan declared, &quot;as in his hands they become victims to their own temerity … The older he grows, the better pugilist he proves himself … He is an extraordinary man.&quot;

==Later life==
Such achievements warranted a title shot, but with Cribb inactive, Richmond opted for retirement instead. His position among England&#x27;s leading pugilists was assured; he twice exhibited his skills for visiting European royalty and was among the most respected and admired of pugilistic trainers and instructors. Even more remarkably, Richmond was one of the pugilists selected to act as an usher at the coronation of George IV in 1821, earning a letter of thanks from Lord Gwydyr and the Home Secretary Lord Sidmouth.

In the 1820s Richmond ran a boxing academy, in which he trained many amateur boxers, including literary figures like William Hazlitt, Lord Byron, and American John Neal.

In his later years, Richmond became close friends with Cribb. The two men often conversed late into the night at Cribb&#x27;s pub, the Union Arms on Panton Street in Westminster. It was here that Richmond spent his last evening, before he died at age 66 in December 1829.

His body was interred in the burial ground of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, which was located some way from the church, beside Hampstead Road, Camden, London.

==Nathan Hale==
Some historians have claimed that on 22 September 1776, Richmond was one of the hangmen who executed Nathan Hale. However, Luke G. Williams, in his biography of Richmond, entitled &quot;Richmond Unchained&quot;, claims that the Richmond who served as the hangman of Hale was not Bill Richmond, but another man of the same surname. Williams writes that:

The Richmond-as-hangman theory took root due to a coalescence of circumstantial evidence: numerous accounts of Hale&#x27;s execution feature references to a black or mulatto hangman named Richmond (for example, the 1856 book &quot;Life of Nathan Hale: The Martyr Spy of the American Revolution&quot;, refers to the &#x27;negro Richmond, the common hangman&#x27;); artwork of the execution published by &quot;Harpers Weekly&quot; in 1860 shows a black man holding the hanging rope; and then there is Richmond&#x27;s connection to Percy and the British military, as well as the proximity of Staten Island to the site of Hale&#x27;s execution in Manhattan. Given this series of coincidences, it seems a reasonable enough piece of speculation. However several hitherto ignored sources from the eighteenth century directly contradict the possibility of Richmond being involved. Quite simply, Hale&#x27;s hangman may have been black and named Richmond, but he wasn&#x27;t &quot;Bill&quot; Richmond. Rather, as reports in the &quot;Gaines Mercury&quot; and &quot;Royal Gazette&quot; indicate, he was a Pennsylvania runaway with the same surname as Bill who ended up working as the hangman for the notorious Boston Provost Marshal William Cunningham. The hangman Richmond absconded from his duties in 1781, Cunningham offering a one-guinea reward for his return a full four years after Bill Richmond&#x27;s likely departure for England.

==In popular culture==
William Mondrich, the boxer in the Regency TV Show &quot;Bridgerton&quot;, is based on him.

<doc id="219781" wikidata="Q109402" url="?curid=219781" title="Aymara people">
<text>The Aymara or Aimara (, ) people are an indigenous people in the Andes and Altiplano regions of South America. Approximately 2.3 million Aymara live in northwest Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. The ancestors of the Aymara lived in the region for many centuries before becoming a subject people of the Inca Empire in the late 15th or early 16th century, and later of the Spanish in the 16th century. With the Spanish American wars of independence (1810–1825), the Aymaras became subjects of the new nations of Bolivia and Peru. After the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), Chile annexed territory with the Aymara population.

==Etymology==
The name of the Aymara people stems from the word &quot;Ayma-ra-mi&quot; meaning &quot;a place with many communally owned farms&quot;. The word &quot;Aymara&quot; also refers to a group of language dialects of which the origin, spread and time-frame are debated.

==History==
===Early history===
The early history of the Aymara people is uncertain. Various hypotheses have been voiced. Archeological data of the Titicaca basin in the Altiplano (high plain) comes from the site of the ancient city of Tiwanaku. A radiocarbon dating study suggests the ancient city was founded in about 110 CE. Origin legends of the Aymara people in terms of time frame seem inconsistent to archeologists. Archeologist Carlos Mamani Condori suggests this is because the Aymara tradition may see the passage of time as a continuum rather than in terms of prehistory and history. The Aymara may have been settlers from elsewhere rather than the builders of the ancient city. Pedro Cieza de León (1518–1554), the Spanish chronicler of Peru, wrote that the Aymara people he met did not know who had built the ancient city.

===Inca era===
====Kingdom of Cusco====
When Inca migrants first arrived at the traditional lands of the Aymara people, some Aymara people and other ethnic groups were living side by side in the village of Acamaca. Acamaca, located to the north of Lake Titicaca, would grow to be the site of the later Kingdom of Cusco, the capital of the Inca Empire and the current day city of Cusco. The Inca arrived not as an army but as migrants searching for agricultural land.

The Aymara people of the Altiplano, the Titicaca basin, and the ancient city of Tiwanaku to the south of Lake Titicaca, also encountered the Inca civilisation prior to the rise of the Inca Empire. One of the Inca origin stories tells of Manco Capac and Mama Occlo being brought up from the waters of Lake Titicaca by the Sun God to create an Inca dynasty.

The rulers of the Kingdom of Cusco were obligated to travel regularly to the Isla del Sol (Sun Island), a rocky island in the southern part of Lake Titicaca, for ritual worship of the Sun God. Charles Stanish writes, 

In 1438, Aymara warriors were, be it as mercenaries, volunteers or conscripts, present in the army of the Inca ruler, Pachacuti in the defense of Cusco during the Chanka–Inca War.

====Inca empire====

The date of Inca conquest of the Altiplano is uncertain beyond that, it began later than 1438 CE and was well completed by 1500 CE.

The often quoted Spanish conquistador and chronicler, Pedro Cieza de León travelled through the Altiplano in 1548. He gives the ruler, Viracocha Inca ( – 1438 CE) as the first to expand Inca territory south from the Kingdom of Cusco but that he was unsuccessful in securing the area. Again, de León records Viracocha&#x27;s successor, Pachacuti ( – 1471 CE) as the leader who succeeded in bringing the area under Inca control, effected by his son, Yupanqui ( – 1493 CE). This chronology has been used widely by historians and archeologists in this field following the seminal work of John Howland Rowe.

However, more recent historians warn that the chronology of the spread of the Inca empire from Cusco, south to the Altiplano, may be more complex. For example, the names of Incan leaders are variable and may have been used across generations; there were revolts amongst the elite of the Inca Kingdom of Cusco itself; and the history given by the Inca to the Spanish chroniclers was given as part mythology. Furthermore, the dating of the conquest of the Incas by the finding of certain ceramics in archeological strata is, in this area, unreliable.

====Inca subjugation of the Aymara====
Rather than one ethnically homogenous group, the Aymara consisted of sometimes warring clans of differing dialects, traditions and geographic distribution. Among them were the Huamallas, Hatuncollas, Chuquitos and Azángaros, and, the Lupaqa and Colla. Their loyalty remained to their village and their local chiefs.

Unlike the many groups of indigenous peoples who lost every vestige of their civilization under Inca rule, the Aymara civilisation survived, at least partially. The Aymara insurrections were violent but also organised and persistent (one of twelve years duration). In the end, though, the Aymara were unsuccessful in throwing off the Inca. The outcome was harsh retribution in the form of executions or exile.

In addition to this direct punishment, the Aymara were increasingly subjugated by the building of civil, military, agricultural and religious infrastructure through their lands, removal of their sons to Cusco for education, taxation in the form of relinquishing sacred objects to the Inca. The Aymara were also required to give labour and military service to the Inca.

Moreover, groups of Aymara were removed from their village to work in other parts of the Empire, the number of Aymara living in Cusco itself was limited and colonists from elsewhere in the Empire were settled in the region.

===Spanish colonial era===
====Conquistadors====
Christopher Colombus set sail from Castile, Spain, in August 1492 CE to find a western sea passage to the spice rich East Indies. In 1513, Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama into the Pacific Ocean. Twenty-nine years later, on 16 November 1532, explorer and conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, travelled south from La Isla Gorgona lured by stories of silver, gold and precious gems. On reaching Cajamarca, a town about 2000 km north of Cusco, Pizarro met and captured Atahualpa. Atahualpa, known for his tyrannical rule, was executed in July 1533.
Pizarro reached Cusco by 1534. Some native groups saw the Spaniards as liberators and lent support to Pizarro. Pizarro also secured a lineage of Inca puppet rulers, including Manco Inca Yupanqui. Manco Inca Yupanqui, was ill treated by Pizarro&#x27;s men. He escaped then returned with tens of thousands warriors, forcing Cusco into siege. After ten months, and the arrival of Spanish reinforcements, Manco Inca Yupanqui withdrew.

Having secured Cusco, Pizarro continued south with the resources, wealth and infrastructure of the Inca and native labour. He benefited from the lack of cohesion between the Altiplano ethnic groups. He had unstoppable soldiers and weapons. In 1542, Spain created the Viceroyalty of Peru.

==== Encomenderos ====
In the new viceroyalty, explorers, conquistadors, governors and generals were given encomiendas. These grants from Spain gave the encomenderos the right to demand taxes and labour from the indigenous people in return for military protection and religious instruction. They were a sign of an elite status in society.

Indigenous men between the ages of 18 and 50 were taxed in money and labour. Tax was collected by the village chiefs. One sixth of taxable men were already assigned to encomenderos who collected the taxes. Twenty percent of the monies went to the crown.

In practice, the responsibilities of the encomiendas were applied partially or not at all, while the taxes were.

In 1870, David Forbes, Mineralogist and voyager, wrote to the Ethnological Society of London, of his observations in Bolivia and Peru,Whatever may have been the condition of the Aymaras under the Incas, it became infinitely worse after the Spanish conquest; it is all but impossible to convey in words a true picture of the barbarous treatment which they, as well as the neighbouring Indian tribes, experienced at the hands of the Spaniards. Treated infinitely worse than slaves, they were torn from their homes and families to be driven like cattle either to the Coca plantations and Gold washings in the Yungas, or hot unhealthy valleys to the east of the high Andes (where they rapidly fell victims to a climate altogether unsuited to their constitution), or to the Silver mines of Potosí, Chayanta, Oruro, &amp;c. (where from forced labour, ill-treatment, and insufficient food, they succumbed equally fast, only to be replaced by fresh supplies similarly obtained). 

==== New Laws ====
In 1542, the Dominican friar, Bartolomé de las Casas published his testimony of the abuse of the Aymara by the Spanish in his book, &quot;A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indians&quot;. On 20 November 1542, in response to criticism, King Charles I of Spain issued the New Laws (&quot;Ordenanzas de Barcelona&quot; or &quot;Leyes Nuevas&quot;).

Indigenous people could no longer be slaves. They could not be sent to the mines without cause. Clergy and Civil servants had to give up their encomiendas to the crown. New grants could not be given and importantly, an encomienda could not be an inheritable property.

Among the approximate five hundred encomiendas in the viceroyalty of Peru, there were cases of corruption and circumvention of the new laws. There were skirmishes between Royalist soldiers and groups of encomenderos, culminating in the death of many encomenderos in an insurrection led by Gonzalo Pizarro in 1548.

The new laws started to stream line the encomienda system but Aymara numbers continued to fall. Furthermore, the indigenous labour force was redistributed causing forced and permanent displacement to cities, factories or mines. By example, in 1573, the indigenous population of labourers at the Potosí silver mines was 11,000. By 1673, the same population numbered 1,600.

==== Viceroy Francisco de Toledo ====
In 1569, Francisco de Toledo was appointed fifth viceroy of Peru by Philip II of Spain. Toledo served in this role until 1581. He made Lima the administrative capital of the viceroyalty. He was tasked with creating a successful system of governance throughout the viceroyalty. To this end, Toledo created provinces and aligned the population with them into new, concentrated settlements called &quot;reductions&quot; (&quot;reducciones de indios&quot;). This involved forced resettlement which caused disruption to aspects of life of the indigenous people such as importance of the extended family clan (&quot;ayllu&quot;), authority of the clan and regional chiefs (&quot;curacas&quot;), land ownership, farming, language, rituals and sacred life (for example, sacred places known as &quot;huacas&quot;).

==== Evangelization ====
Toledo was also asked to consider the legitimacy of the Spanish conquest. Toledo concluded that the conquistadors were no more legitimate in their rule than the Inca. However, the viceroyalty of Peru was legitimate on the basis of the Spanish bringing Catholic Christianity to the indigenous people.

Toledo instructed the secular clergy and the leaders of the monastic orders to begin the evangelisation of the viceroyalty. This was not an easy task due to a lack of clergy, lack of experience of the monastic orders in evangelizing and the language barrier between the Spanish and the indigenous groups who spoke, for the most part, dialects of Aymaran or Quechuan.

Some efforts were made to provide simple lexicons for religious teaching. However, this was difficult because the Aymara language had no orthography and Aymara phonetics did not compare well with those of the Spanish language. Ludovico Bertonio was an Italian Jesuit missionary who, in 1603 CE, wrote about the Aymara language. On one hand, some clergy tried to adapt notable aspects of the Aymara people&#x27;s spiritual life, for example, rituals or seasons of the year, with the liturgy and the liturgical calendar. On the other hand, such efforts were shunned by those who saw the Aymara spiritual life as one of idolatry and objected to the use of alcohol or coca in rituals.

==== Aymara rebellion ====
In the Spanish colonial era, the region of Aymara and Quechuan habitation was divided into eleven provinces. They were Canchi, Caranga, Chocarca, Colla, Collagua, Collahuaya, Omasuyo, Lupaca, Quillaca, Urbina, and Picasa. Insurrection in the region occurred in an intermittent, semi-organised manner from as early as 1629 CE through to the Peruvian war of Independence (1809 – 1826) when Spanish colonial rule ended. A larger and more persistent insurrection occurred between 1779 and 1781. The Inca descendant, Túpac Amaru, is described as its grand leader. However, historians Julian Steward in 1946 and Steve Stern in 1987 warn that the history of this era is more complex then the romantic version involving Amaru with intricate and various associations between ethnic groups.

===== Annexation by Chile =====

The War of the Pacific (1879 – 1883) or the nitrate war, was a conflict between Chile and an alliance of Bolivia and Peru. It was precipitated by a northward incursion by Chile to control sources of guano in the Litoral province of Bolivia and the Tarapacá province of Peru. It resulted in Aymara people being politically separated between the three nations.

The border between Peru and Bolivia transects Lake Titicaca. Chile denied Bolivia of its only seaport at Arica.

The Aymara people left living in Chile, once again had most aspects of their lives torn asunder. In this case, it was Chilean military clergy who began the &quot;chilenization&quot; of the Aymara. The emphasis of this program was indoctrination of the ideology of Chilean nationalism.

==Demographics==
The total number of Aymara people is quoted at 1,847,000. Approximately 30% live in Peru and approximately 60% in Bolivia. The rest are divided between Chile (6%) and Argentina (0.2%). Most self-identify as Christian. Aymara language is a third official language in Peru after Spanish and Quechua. It is spoken by 1.6% of the population.

==Culture==
=== Flag ===
The Aymara flag is known as the Wiphala. It is an ancient design associated with the Inca. It is an ethnic symbol for the Aymara and has been adopted as a symbol of indigenous rights. It consists of seven colors patched together in diagonal stripes. The different colours represent geographical regions. The meaning of colours have been adapted to represent different areas of indigenous culture: red (planet earth); orange (society); yellow (strength and morality); green (economy and ecology); blue (supernatural life); and, violet (self-determination).

=== Language ===
The native language of the Aymara people is called Aymara. It is spoken from the north of Lake Titicaca to the south of Lake Poopó. Aymara is a third official language in Peru after Spanish and Quechua. It is spoken by 1.6% of the Peruvian population. Aymara has no distant language relative but there are some nearby similar languages. Quechua has some overlap with Aymara brought by contact. There are two closely related languages called Jaqaru and Kawki. A small isolated group of about 1000 people speak these languages in and around the village of Tupe, in Yauyos Province, in the remote highlands southwest of Lima. Other related languages are presumable extinct.

=== Dress and textiles ===
Aymara people spin alpaca and llama wool and then colour it with vegetable and mineral dyes. Urine may be used as a mordant (colour fixative). Wools and cotton are woven on a horizontal peg loom by both men and women. There is no broad loom weaving and so, traditional garments such as carrying cloths and ponchos are made by joining two pieces. The colours are vibrant. Patterns are striped or geometrical.

Traditional clothing items include the Chullo, a knitted wool cap with ear flaps and ties; a woven carrying cloth Aguayo carried across the shoulders; a poncho; and a full circle skirt gathered and decorated in horizontal layers (corte).

Development of the Aymara textile industry has led to expositions of luxury alpaca wool garments, silks, lace and delicately embroidered blouses. Another innovation drawing on the Aymara colorful aesthetic is buildings designed in a &quot;Neo-Andean&quot; style which has appeared in El Alto.

Both Quechua and Aymara women in Peru and Bolivia took up the style of wearing bowler hats in the 1920s. According to legend, a shipment of bowler hats was sent from Europe to Bolivia via Peru for use by Europeans working on railroad construction. They were given to the indigenous people if they were too small for the construction workers.

=== Food ===

Plants available to the traditional Aymara for through subsistence agriculture or trade were wild tomato (Solanum huaylasense); lucuma (Pouteria lucuma), a sweet fruit; a small orange fruit of the nightshade family which grows within a green calyx; qamasa and quinoa (Amaranthaceae) of the amaranth family for their seeds and leaves; purple corn (of the flint maize family); maca (Lepidium meyenii) a ginseng or turnip like vegetable; onion (Trichlora); olluco (Ullucus), a root vegetable that looks like a small potato; Yacón, a root vegetable called ground apple and cherimoya (Annona).

The potato (Solanum tuberosum) is indigenous to the region of the Aymara. Wild species are no longer eaten but are still found. Peru has 47% of all wild potato species. Cultivated species are a dietary staple. Potato can be stored for many years as Chuño. Potatoes are exposed to freezing temperatures overnight then dried during the day. It provides food security in time of famine. However, it is not of high nutritional value. It is used in a variety of dishes. One traditional dish, common in La Paz, is Chairo. It is a type of stew made with Chuño, meat, carrots, onions and corn.

==== Coca ====

The Aymara word for tree is &quot;khoka&quot; from which the word &quot;coca&quot; is derived. Aymara people have had, throughout their history, traditional, recreational, ritual and medicinal uses for coca. The whole leaves can be chewed, brewed as a tea or sucked with a pinch of wood ash. Medicinally, coca has been used to relieve stomach complaints, including hunger. Whether or not coca ameliorates the symptoms of altitude related illness remains uncertain.

The psychoactive drug, cocaine is just one of the alkaloid substances found in coca plants. One variant grown for its cocaine content is Erythroxylum coca. Other variants of the coca plant contain less potent or non-toxic alkaloids and give only a mild stimulant effect.

== Religion and spirituality ==
See &quot;Evangelisation&quot;

Aymara religion is a syncretic system of faith, bringing indigenous spirituality and Catholicism into close proximity. The syncretism is evident in the liturgy of the Aymara lands. Christian feast days which coincide temporally with Aymara spiritual events have associated, or even combined, meaning and ritual.

Aymara indigenous spirituality (&quot;pachakuti&quot;) is based on the seasons and key agricultural events. It gives the foundation of the existence of the Aymara and their responsibility to the natural environment. The Aymara concept of time comes from the cycle of natural events such as the seasons, historical events such as the arrival of the Spaniards and mythological concepts such as the time of the sun. When there is a major shift in these, it is transformation (&quot;kuti&quot;).

The deities are regarded in a hierarchical system.
The spirits of the high mountains and altiplano are worshipped as entities which provide for and protect the people. These entities are called &quot;Achachilas&quot; which might be understood as grandparents, ancestors or gods of the household. The majestic mountains, Illimani, Illampu and Huayna Potosí are three Achachilas deities.

&quot;Auki auki&quot; are people chosen to represent Achachilas in festivals so the spirits may dance upon the earth. Human figuries of the Achachilas are found at The Witches&#x27; Market (calle de las brujes) in La Paz. The items required for ritual offerings are sold at the market. They include coca leaves, incense, stillborn llama, potions, soaps and candles.

The stillborn llama (&quot;sullus&quot;), mummified by exposure to the cold, dry conditions of the Altiplano, are sold in all sizes from tiny to near fully formed. Their legs are bound and blessings have been given by a priest (&quot;yatiri&quot;). Stillborn are a frequent occurrence in llamas who can fall pregnant again at two weeks post delivery. The sullus are used as burnt offerings or are buried in the foundations of the house. In Aymara mythology, the &quot;Heavenly Llama&quot; drinks water from the ocean and urinates it as rain. According to Aymara eschatology, llamas will return to the water springs and lagoons where they come from at the end of all time.

Traditionally, the Aymara dead have been buried in and outside the home, in cairns, in stone dolmens and in cylindrical, upright graves. The chullpa funerial towers were reserved for the elite of society. They varied in size, architecture and the number of burial chambers.

== Political activism ==
There are many challenges faced by the Aymara people. On 23 June 2023, 48 Aymara from the La Paz region were consulted in order to prepare a contribution to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2028 in Dubai (COP28). The difficulties recognised included: poverty, racism, limited access to the justice system, lack of informed consent in the health system, lack of culturally appropriate health care, loss of traditional knowledge and environmental damage.

However, responses to these challenges are not all the same. For example, some Aymara families put deeper Spanish language learning over Aymara language skills for their children in order to improve the children&#x27;s chances of improving their options in the general population.

Furthermore, the nature of response to these challenges delineates along national lines.

=== Bolivian Aymara activism ===

In the 1960s, peasant student activists and intellectuals in La Paz, developed a group on the basis of the ideology of Fausto Reinaga (1906 – 1994). Felipe Quispe (1942 – 2021) organised the group. He founded the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, in 1989. Despite the imprisonment of Quispe, the group was involved in violent incidents until 1995.

Quispe was released from prison in 1997. He then reinvigorated the CSUTCB (Confederación sindical única de trabajadores campesinos de Boliva or Unified Syndical Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia) which had first formed in 1979 to represent Aymara people.

Between 2000 and 2005, a succession of protests, such as the Bolivian gas conflict in 2003 and mass protests in 2005, toppled the government of Carlos Mesa.

Along Katarist lines, the Movement Towards Socialism (&quot;Movimiento al Socialismo&quot; – &quot;Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos or&quot; MAS) political party evolved to support coco farmers, mine workers and the urban poor. The party, under the leadership of Evo Morales and the concept of a &quot;pre-hispanic utopia&quot; was democratically elected to government in December 2005. It remains the incumbent party in 2024.

<text>A sanctuary lamp, chancel lamp, altar lamp, everlasting light, or eternal flame is a light that shines before the altar of sanctuaries in many Jewish and Christian places of worship. Prescribed in Exodus 27:20-21 of the Torah, this icon has taken on different meanings in each of the religions that have adopted it. The passage, which refers to prescriptions for the tabernacle, states:

==In Jewish tradition==
 
In Judaism, the sanctuary lamp is known as a Ner Tamid (Hebrew, “eternal flame” or “eternal light”), Hanging or standing in front of the ark in every Jewish synagogue, it is meant to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem, as well as the perpetual fire kept on the altar of burnt offerings before the Temple. It also symbolizes God&#x27;s eternal presence, and is thus never extinguished, and to draw parallels between God and fire or light as emphasized throughout Exodus in the Torah.

These lights are never allowed to dim or go out, and in case of electric problems, alternative emergency power is used to prevent them from extinguishing. 

Though once fuelled by oil, most today are electric lights.

===Hanukkah story===
The eternal light is central to one of many stories behind the celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. When the ancient Maccabees rebelled and reclaimed the Temple in Jerusalem, they rekindled the eternal light. However, there was only enough oil to keep the flame burning for one day, and it took eight days to bring new oil. Miraculously, according to the narrative in the Talmud, the flame continued burning until new oil arrived.

Modern Jewish celebrations of Hanukkah include lighting a Hanukkah menorah (&quot;Hanukkiyah&quot;), which has nine branches. This includes the &quot;shamash&quot; used to light the other eight flames (candles or oil wicks), evoking the story.

==In Christian tradition==
Some Christian churches have at least one lamp continually burning before the tabernacle, not only as an ornament, but for the purpose of worship. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal of the Catholic Church, for instance, states (in 316): “In accordance with traditional custom, near the tabernacle a special lamp, fueled by oil or wax, should be kept alight to indicate and honor the presence of Christ.” The sanctuary lamp, also called a chancel lamp, is placed before the tabernacle or aumbry in Roman Catholic churches as a sign of Jesus’ presence within, and in Old Catholic and Anglican churches as a sign that the Blessed Sacrament is reserved or stored. It is also found in the chancel of Lutheran and Methodist churches to indicate the presence of Christ in the sanctuary, as well as a belief in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The sanctuary lamp may also be found in Eastern Orthodox Churches. Other Christian denominations burn the lamp to show that the light of Christ always burns in a sin-darkened world. A main influence from Judaism in the Old Testament is when God instructed Moses to have a lamp with pure oil perpetually burn in the Tabernacle (Exodus 27:20-21). This is the precedent for the Catholic custom of burning a candle before the tabernacle, which should be immobile and locked to prevent theft and Host desecration, as well as whenever transporting the Sacrament anywhere.

Such sanctuary or tabernacle lamps are most often coloured red, though this is not prescribed. This serves to distinguish this light from various other votive lights within the church. In the Catholic Church, red is widely used despite the preference for white expressed by Fortescue. The custom of multiple lights in odd numbers (i.e., three, five, seven, or more) in place of a single lamp has become rarer, though it is still seen in some older Catholic churches and in Eastern Christianity. The lamp may hang by rope or chain over the tabernacle or near the entry of the sanctuary, or affixed to a wall; it may also be on a ledge or the altar gradine right beside the tabernacle, or on its own nearby stand placed on the floor, as seen in the image of St. Martin&#x27;s Church, Kortrijk, Belgium, in the article Church tabernacle. Oil lamps or candles may be used, while electric ones are seen.

==Secular references to the Sanctuary lamp==

In the United States, the Boy Scout Jewish religious emblem, a medal earned by scouts for meeting certain requirements of religious activity and education, is called the &quot;Ner Tamid&quot;.

A song by Matisyahu called &quot;Aish Tamid&quot; (&quot;eternal flame&quot;) that appears in his albums &quot;Shake Off the Dust... Arise&quot; (2004) and &quot;Live at Stubb&#x27;s&quot; (2006).

<text>Crispin Jeremy Rupert Blunt (born 15 July 1960) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Reigate from 1997 to 2024. Formerly a member of the Conservative Party, he was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Youth Justice within the Ministry of Justice from 2010 to 2012 and Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee from 2015 until 2017.

Blunt first entered the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, when he replaced the then MP Sir George Gardiner, who had been deselected by the Constituency Conservative Association Executive Council and joined the Referendum Party. In 2013, Blunt was deselected by the Constituency Executive Council, with speculation that this was due to his public announcement that he was gay. However, after a ballot of party members in Reigate, the decision was overturned by a margin of 5–1 and Blunt was reselected as the Conservative candidate for the 2015 general election.

In October 2023, he was arrested on suspicion of rape and possession of controlled substances, and released on conditional bail. He subsequently had the Conservative Party whip removed, continuing to sit as an independent MP until the dissolution of Parliament in May 2024. Blunt did not stand for re-election at the subsequent general election.

==Early life and military service==
Blunt was born on 15 July 1960 in West Germany, one of three sons of English parents Adrienne (née Richardson) and Major-General Peter Blunt (1923–2003). He was educated at Wellington College, an independent school in Berkshire. He then attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he won the Queen&#x27;s Medal, following which he gained a regular commission in the British Army. As an in-service degree, he studied politics at University College, Durham between 1981 and 1984, where he was elected president of the Durham Union Society in 1983. He graduated with an upper second-class honours degree. In 1991, he gained a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree at the Cranfield School of Management.

Blunt was commissioned as an officer in the British Army on 4 August 1979 as a second lieutenant. Having been commissioned into the General List, he transferred to the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary&#x27;s Own) on 8 March 1980, and his regular commission was confirmed. He was promoted to lieutenant on 4 August 1981, and to captain on 4 February 1986. During the 1980s, he was stationed in Cyprus, Germany, and Britain, serving as a troop leader, regimental operations officer and armoured reconnaissance squadron commander. He resigned his commission on 24 September 1990, and was appointed to the Reserve of Officers.

==Political career==
Blunt contested his first Parliamentary seat at the 1992 general election, as the Conservative candidate in West Bromwich East. From 1991 to 1992, Blunt was a representative of the Forum of Private Business. In 1993, he was appointed a special adviser to Malcolm Rifkind, the Secretary of State for Defence, and worked in the same capacity when Rifkind became Foreign Secretary from 1995 to 1997.

===Member of Parliament===
At the 1997 general election, Blunt was elected to Parliament as Member for Reigate in Surrey, succeeding the long-serving strongly Eurosceptic MP Sir George Gardiner, who had been deselected by the local Conservative Party. Blunt was subsequently appointed to the House of Commons Defence Select Committee.

In July 1997, he was elected as Secretary of the Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee and the Conservative Middle East Council. In May 2000, he joined the House of Commons Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee and in July 2003 he was elected Chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council, a position he still occupies.

The new Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed Blunt to the Opposition front bench as Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland in September 2001. In July 2002, he was appointed as deputy to Tim Yeo, Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. On 1 May 2003 he resigned his position on the front bench, saying that Duncan Smith was a &quot;handicap&quot; to the Conservatives. He decided to resign at that time in the expectation that the Conservative Party would make over 500 gains in the 2003 local government elections, but in the belief that these would be achieved in spite of, rather than because of, Duncan Smith&#x27;s leadership. Blunt timed his resignation so that it became public after the polls closed but before the results were declared.

The following day he was unanimously reselected by his local party as their prospective parliamentary candidate, but in May 2003, he failed to persuade 25 of his fellow Conservative MPs to call for a vote of confidence. He accepted that no challenge for the party leadership would be immediately forthcoming and returned to the back benches. In November 2003, Michael Howard replaced Duncan Smith after a vote of no confidence.

Blunt became a party whip under Howard, but on 9 June 2005, he took a leave of absence from that role to support the expected leadership bid of Malcolm Rifkind. However, when Rifkind was knocked out of the party leadership contest, Blunt returned to the Whips&#x27; office and wrote to all party members in his constituency asking them to rank the remaining contenders in order of preference so he could best represent his constituents.

Blunt is a former joint chair of the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding. When the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Coalition formed a government in 2010, Blunt was appointed as the first Minister of State for Prisons at the Ministry of Justice. His responsibilities included prisons and probation, youth justice, criminal law and sentencing policy, and criminal justice. He is also a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group.

In November 2013, Blunt was re-selected to stand in the 2015 general election for the Conservative Party, having undergone a postal ballot of constituency members. The postal ballot was triggered when the executive council came to a vote with a majority decision not to endorse his candidacy. Having won the postal ballot Blunt called for the executive council to consider their position. The lack of support from a majority of the executive council was partly attributed to the allegedly homophobic views of some older Conservative voters in the area. Roger Newstead, the chairman of the Reigate South and Earlswood Branch, wrote a private letter to Ben Mearns, who had resigned from the branch committee after protesting the decision to force a postal ballot. In the letter, Newstead said: &quot;I do not know what motivated my executive colleagues but I suspect that Crispin has been the author of his own misfortune. There is no doubt in my mind that his very public and totally unnecessary announcement that he was &#x27;gay&#x27; was the final straw for some members, particularly those in the north of the borough, with whom there had been a number of previous disagreements on policy matters. A number of lady members were very offended by the manner in which his marriage broke down. Apparently Victoria&#x27;s version was very different from Crispin&#x27;s&quot;.

Later clarifying his views to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Newstead said: &quot;I still say it was unnecessary [for Crispin Blunt to come out]. To me it was an error of judgment. I wouldn&#x27;t have done anything like that. I would have just said if anyone had asked me: politicians have a unique lifestyle, it doesn&#x27;t suit everybody and there is a long history of parliamentary marriages breaking down. You don&#x27;t have to go out and tell people you have got homosexual tendencies. It is a private matter and it shouldn&#x27;t have been put in the public domain. He put it in the public domain&quot;.

In May 2014, Blunt was one of seven unsuccessful candidates for the chairmanship of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee. On 19 June 2015, it was announced that Blunt had been elected to the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, a post he held until 12 July 2017 when he was defeated by Conservative candidate Tom Tugendhat.

Prior to the 2016 EU Referendum, Blunt supported Brexit.

In September 2017, Blunt was elected chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, the cross-party group which represents humanists in Parliament. In 2018, he became an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

On 11 April 2022, after fellow MP Imran Ahmad Khan was found guilty of a child sex offence, Blunt issued a statement in defence of Ahmad Khan which criticised the verdict, describing it as an &quot;international scandal, with dreadful wider implications for millions of LGBT+ Muslims around the world&quot; and said that it &quot;relied on lazy tropes about LGBT+ people&quot;. He also said that he hoped for Ahmad Khan to return to public service. Blunt&#x27;s intervention was strongly condemned and members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on global LGBT+ affairs which was chaired by Blunt, resigned in protest. Blunt later apologised for his comments and resigned as chair of the APPG. In May 2022, Blunt backtracked on this apology and described Ahmad Khan&#x27;s conviction as a &quot;serious miscarriage of justice&quot;.

On 1 May 2022, he announced he would not seek re-election at the 2024 general election.

On 16 October 2022, he became the first Conservative MP to publicly call for Liz Truss to resign, calling it &quot;blindingly obvious&quot; that she must go.

===Political views===
A long-term Eurosceptic, Blunt issued a pamphlet in 1998 when first elected to parliament which called for an in-out referendum. In 1998, Blunt argued against the equal age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals, stating that &quot;It is also clear that there is a much greater strand of homosexuality than of heterosexuality which depends for its gratification on the exploitation of youth&quot;. In 2004, he was also absent for votes on legalising (same-sex) civil partnerships and allowing marriages to remain valid if they became a same-sex marriage after the granting of a Gender Recognition Certificate. In June 2016, Blunt championed LGBT rights, during the campaigning of the EU referendum, stating that the UK would be the &quot;world&#x27;s leading proponents of LGBTI rights, in or out of the EU&quot;.

Blunt has been described as &quot;a long-term critic of Israel&quot;. He is a co-director of the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, and in October 2023 he announced the group&#x27;s intention to prosecute UK government leaders for &quot;aiding and abetting war crimes in Gaza&quot; amid the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, warning his colleagues in Westminster of the peril of guilt through complicity.

He voted against the Cameron–Clegg coalition government in 2013 on the issue of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

Blunt has called attention to the presence of prayers as part of Parliament&#x27;s formal business. He put forward an Early Day Motion on the issue in 2019, arguing that the practice was discriminatory against non-religious MPs since those MPs who choose to pray are able to reserve a seat for parliamentary business that day and are more likely to ask questions; there are 650 elected MPs in the UK Parliament, but only enough seating for 427 at any one time. In 2020, he again raised the issue in the House, with new speaker Lindsay Hoyle expressing sympathy with the need for reform.

Blunt is one of the most prominent Conservative advocates of transgender rights. He argues that supporting transgender individuals is an extension of the party&#x27;s tradition of supporting individual liberty.

Blunt&#x27;s voting record in Parliament had previously been broadly unsympathetic towards gay rights. He later stated regret for that part of his voting record. In January 2016, he stated that he uses poppers, during a parliamentary debate that discussed banning them along with other legal highs.

On 16 October 2022, Blunt stated in his opinion that Liz Truss would have to resign as Prime Minister. Blunt said, &quot;I think the game is up and it&#x27;s now a question as to how the succession is managed. If there is such a weight of opinion in the parliamentary party that we have to have a change, then it will be effected.&quot; He was the first Conservative MP to openly call for Truss&#x27;s resignation.

==Personal life==
===Family and interests===
Blunt married Victoria Jenkins in September 1990 in Kensington and they have a daughter and son. His niece is the actress Emily Blunt. In August 2010, he announced that he was leaving his wife in order &quot;to come to terms with his homosexuality&quot;. They remain separated but have not divorced.

Blunt is a cricketer, a former member of the Parliamentarians team. He is a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

===2023 Arrest===
In October 2023, Blunt was arrested by Surrey Police on suspicion of rape and possession of drugs. He was released on police bail pending further investigation. He had the Conservative Party whip removed and subsequently sat as an independent MP for the remainder of the parliamentary session. Blunt said that he expected to be cleared, and that he had previously reported an attempt of extortion to the police. In April 2024, it was reported that Blunt had not had his bail extended and the police were continuing with their investigation.

<doc id="219788" wikidata="Q7331071" url="?curid=219788" title="Richmondtown, Staten Island">
<text>Richmondtown is a neighborhood in the Mid-Island section of Staten Island, New York City. It is bounded by Arthur Kill Road on the northwest, Richmond Road on the north, Amboy Road on the east and southeast, and the United Hebrew and Ocean View cemeteries on the southwest.

==Name==
Originally known as Coccles Town, sometimes Cuckolds Town, because of the abundance of oyster and clam shells found in the waters of the nearby Fresh Kills, Richmondtown gained its present name in 1728 when the village now preserved as Historic Richmond Town was founded. The village became the county seat of Richmond County (with which Staten Island is coterminous) and remained as such until the emergence of St. George soon after the ferries to Manhattan and Brooklyn began to proliferate at the latter site near the end of the 19th century.

==Location==
Located at the base of Lighthouse Hill with New Dorp and Oakwood to the east, Richmondtown has seen much new home construction since the mid-1960s, and ranks as one of the most popular destinations for families seeking to relocate to Staten Island from New York City&#x27;s other boroughs, especially Brooklyn.

The town is also home to one of the ten remaining Volunteer Fire Departments in New York City Richmond Engine Company 1, which operates a 2005 American LaFrance Engine purchased through a federal home security grant.

The Church of St. Andrew and Voorlezer&#x27;s House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. St. Patrick&#x27;s Church was declared a New York City Landmark in 1968.

<doc id="219789" wikidata="Q845537" url="?curid=219789" title="Swedish People's Party of Finland">
<text>The Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland (SPP; , SFP; , RKP) is a Finnish political party founded in 1906. Its primary aim is to represent the interests of the minority Swedish-speaking population of Finland. The party is currently a participant in the Government of Petteri Orpo, holding the posts of Minister of Education, Minister for European Affairs, and Minister of Youth, Sport and Physical Activity.

An ethnic catch-all party, its main election issue since its inception has been the Swedish-speaking Finns&#x27; right to their own language while maintaining the official position of the Swedish language in Finland. Ideologically, it is liberal, social-liberal, centrist, and pro-European. The party has been in a governmental position from 1979 to 2015 and again since 2019, with one or two seats in government, and has collaborated with both centre-right and centre-left parties in parliament.

The fact that both the Finnish centre-right and centre-left have needed the support from the party has meant that they have been able to affect politics of Finland on a larger scale than the party&#x27;s actual size would suggest. The continued position of the Swedish language as one of two official languages in Finland in the face of a steady erosion of the Swedish speakers share of the population from 12% at independence to 5% today as well as the maintenance of the Swedish-speaking minority&#x27;s right to Swedish culture are two of the results of the party&#x27;s influence in Finnish politics. The party is a member of the Liberal International, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and Renew Europe. The youth organisation of the party is called Svensk Ungdom (Swedish Youth).

==History and electorate==
 The Swedish Party (1870–1906), a parliamentary elite party based on members in the Diet of Finland, is the historical predecessor of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland. It was a part of the Svecoman movement and its main policy was opposition of the Fennoman movement.

Unlike Fennomans, who were largely liberal on other matters than the language question, the Svecoman were conservative. Axel Lille and Axel Olof Freudenthal are often considered as some of the main &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the movement. Most members of the Liberal Party joined the Swedish Party in the 1880s, after the Liberals ceased to exist as a distinct party. The Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland was founded in the 1906 party congress of the Swedish Party, making it one of the oldest parties in Finland. The first leader of Swedish People&#x27;s Party was Axel Lille.

The current leader of the party is Anders Adlercreutz. In the Parliament of Finland the representative for Åland is usually included in SPP&#x27;s parliamentary group, regardless of his/her party affiliation; parties on Åland are separate from those on the mainland, but their common interest in Swedish-language issues gives them much in common with the Swedish People&#x27;s Party group as regards national politics. 

The party receives its main electoral support from the Swedish speaking minority, which makes up about 5.5% of Finland&#x27;s population. During its history, the party has suffered slow but steady decline in adherence, following the decline of the percentage of Swedish-speaking population. In 1907, the party received 12% of national votes; after World War II, it received 7% of the vote; and in the 2011 parliamentary election, it received 4.3% of the votes (and nine MPs). In municipal elections, it holds large majorities in municipalities with a Swedish-speaking majority.

Despite its position as one of the minor political parties in the Finnish parliament, it has frequently been one of the partners forming the governing coalition cabinets. Since 1956, the year when Urho Kekkonen was elected President, the party has been nearly continuously in the government. It has been part of all coalitions with the significant exception of Paasio&#x27;s first cabinet (1966–68), which included only socialists (Social Democratic Party (SDP), the split SDP faction Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders and Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League) and the Centre Party.
Short periods of rule by single-party minority governments, Miettunen cabinet (1961–62, Centre) and Paasio&#x27;s second government (1972, SDP) and of nonpartisan caretaker governments have also interrupted its stay in the government. For this reason, the SPP is often criticized for being a single-issue party that allegedly accepts nearly all other policies as long as its own vital interest, the status of the Swedish language is maintained.

However, although Vanhanen&#x27;s first cabinet made Swedish a voluntary subject in the upper secondary schools&#x27; matriculation exam, the SPP remained in the government. In contrast, the Greens left the previous government after a new nuclear power plant was decided in 2002.

The SPP&#x27;s long continuous participation in the Finnish cabinets came to an end in following the 2015 parliamentary election when it was left out of the Sipilä Cabinet. In June 2019, the SPP returned to government with two ministerial positions in the Rinne Cabinet, the Minister of Justice and the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and Equality.

Recently, the SPP has emphasized the liberal part of its programme, attempting to woo voters outside its traditional Swedish-speaking electorate. In 2010, the party added the word &quot;Suomen&quot; (&quot;of Finland&quot;) to its official Finnish name.

==Political positions==

The Swedish language is one of the two official languages of Finland. The SPP has as its main purpose the protection and strengthening of the position of the Swedish language in Finland.

The Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland has the most eclectic profile of any of the political parties in Finland. Its members and supporters chiefly include:
* Fishermen and farmers from the Swedish-speaking coastal areas.
* Small-town dwellers from the adjacent Swedish-speaking and bilingual towns.
* A significant part of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland.
* Left-leaning middle class people.
* Liberals in general, who currently have no representation of their own in the Parliament of Finland, and who as such benefit from the predominantly liberal values of the SPP.

Although the SPP represents a small minority of Finland, having Swedish as a mother tongue is not much of a political handicap in and of itself. Several times, Swedish speaking presidential candidates have gathered considerable support, although not necessarily as candidates for the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland:

* In 1944, the Swedish-Finnish Carl G. E. Mannerheim a hero of Finnish independence became Finland&#x27;s 6th president.
* In 1956, the Swedish-speaking Social Democrat Karl-August Fagerholm got one elector&#x27;s vote less than needed to be elected, and the Agrarian Urho Kekkonen was elected.
* In 1994, the SPP&#x27;s candidate Elisabeth Rehn was defeated by the Social Democrat candidate Martti Ahtisaari, also with a narrow margin (53.9% to 46.1%).
* In 2024, the NCP&#x27;s candidate Alexander Stubb was elected as the 13th president of Finland.

The SPP supported Finland&#x27;s accession bid to NATO.

<doc id="219794" wikidata="Q209760" url="?curid=219794" title="Rudder">
<text>A rudder is a primary control surface used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, airship, or other vehicle that moves through a fluid medium (usually air or water). On an airplane, the rudder is used primarily to counter adverse yaw and p-factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft&#x27;s stern, tail, or afterend. Often rudders are shaped to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a tiller—essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm—may be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a helmsman. In larger vessels, cables, pushrods, or hydraulics may link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.

==History of the rudder==

Generally, a rudder is &quot;part of the steering apparatus of a boat or ship that is fastened outside the hull, &quot; denoting all types of oars, paddles, and rudders. More specifically, the steering gear of ancient vessels can be classified into side-rudders and stern-mounted rudders, depending on their location on the ship. A third term, steering oar, can denote both types. In a Mediterranean context, side-rudders are more specifically called quarter-rudders as the later term designates more exactly where the rudder was mounted. Stern-mounted rudders are uniformly suspended at the back of the ship in a central position.

Although some classify a steering oar as a rudder, others argue that the steering oar used in ancient Egypt and Rome was not a true rudder and define only the stern-mounted rudder used in ancient Han dynasty China as a true rudder. The steering oar can interfere with the handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its helmsman, was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in ancient China during the 1st century AD. In regards to the ancient Phoenician (1550–300 BC) use of the steering oar without a rudder in the Mediterranean, Leo Block (2003) writes:

A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts as a brake. The second sail, located forward, could be trimmed to offset the turning tendency of the mainsail and minimize the need for course corrections by the steering oar, which would have substantially improved sail performance.

The steering oar or steering board is an oversized oar or board to control the direction of a ship or other watercraft before the invention of the rudder. It is normally attached to the starboard side in larger vessels, though in smaller ones it is rarely if ever, attached.

===Steering oar/gear===
==== Ancient Egypt ====

Rowing oars set aside for steering appeared on large Egyptian vessels long before the time of Menes (3100 BC). In the Old Kingdom (2686–2134 BC) as many as five steering oars are found on each side of passenger boats. The tiller, at first a small pin run through the stock of the steering oar, can be traced to the fifth dynasty (2504–2347 BC). Both the tiller and the introduction of an upright steering post abaft reduced the usual number of necessary steering oars to one each side. Single steering oars put on the stern can be found in several tomb models of the time, particularly during the Middle Kingdom when tomb reliefs suggest them commonly employed in Nile navigation. The first literary reference appears in the works of the Greek historian Herodotus (484–424 BC), who had spent several months in Egypt: &quot;They make one rudder, and this is thrust through the keel&quot;, probably meaning the crotch at the end of the keel (as depicted in the &quot;Tomb of Menna&quot;).

In Iran, oars mounted on the side of ships for steering are documented from the 3rd millennium BCE in artwork, wooden models, and even remnants of actual boats.

==== Ancient Rome ====
Roman navigation used sexillie quarter steering oars that went in the Mediterranean through a long period of constant refinement and improvement so that by Roman times ancient vessels reached extraordinary sizes. The strength of the steering oar lay in its combination of effectiveness, adaptability and simpleness. Roman quarter steering oar mounting systems survived mostly intact through the medieval period.

By the first half of the 1st century AD, steering gear mounted on the stern were also quite common in Roman river and harbour craft as proved from reliefs and archaeological finds (Zwammerdam, Woerden 7). A tomb plaque of Hadrianic age shows a harbour tug boat in Ostia with a long stern-mounted oar for better leverage. The boat already featured a spritsail, adding to the mobility of the harbour vessel. Further attested Roman uses of stern-mounted steering oars includes barges under tow, transport ships for wine casks, and diverse other ship types. A large river barge found at the mouth of the Rhine near Zwammerdam featured a large steering gear mounted on the stern. According to new research, the advanced Nemi ships, the palace barges of emperor Caligula (37–41 AD), may have featured 14-m-long rudders.

===Sternpost-mounted rudder===

==== Ancient China ====


The world&#x27;s oldest known depiction of a sternpost-mounted rudder can be seen on a pottery model of a Chinese junk dating from the 1st century AD during the Han dynasty, predating their appearance in the West by a thousand years. In China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC). Sternpost-mounted rudders started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, the Chinese continued to use the steering oar long after they invented the rudder, since the steering oar still had practical use for inland rapid-river travel. One of oldest known depictions of the Chinese stern-mounted rudder (&quot;duò&quot; ) can be seen on a pottery model of a junk dating from the 1st century AD, during the Han dynasty (202 BC220 AD). It was discovered in Guangzhou in an archaeological excavation carried out by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and Academia Sinica of Taiwan in 1958. Within decades, several other Han dynasty ship models featuring rudders were found in archaeological excavations. The first solid written reference to the use of a rudder without a steering oar dates to the 5th century.

Chinese rudders are attached to the hull by means of wooden jaws or sockets, while typically larger ones were suspended from above by a rope tackle system so that they could be raised or lowered into the water. Also, many junks incorporated &quot;fenestrated rudders&quot; (rudders with holes in them, supposedly allowing for better control). Detailed descriptions of Chinese junks during the Middle Ages are known from various travellers to China, such as Ibn Battuta of Tangier, Morocco and Marco Polo of Venice, Italy. The later Chinese encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) and the 17th-century European traveler Louis Lecomte wrote of the junk design and its use of the rudder with enthusiasm and admiration.

Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that the Chinese invented the &quot;median, vertical and axial&quot; sternpost-mounted rudder, and that such a kind of rudder preceded the pintle-and-gudgeon rudder found in the West by roughly a millennium.

==== Ancient India ====
A Chandraketugarh (West Bengal) seal dated between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD depicts a steering mechanism on a ship named &quot;Indra of the Ocean&quot; (Jaladhisakra), which indicates that it was a sea-bound vessel.

====Medieval Near East====
Arab ships also used a sternpost-mounted rudder. On their ships &quot;the rudder is controlled by two lines, each attached to a crosspiece mounted on the rudder head perpendicular to the plane of the rudder blade.&quot; The earliest evidence comes from the &quot;Ahsan al-Taqasim fi Marifat al-Aqalim&quot; (&#x27;The Best Divisions for the Classification of Regions&#x27;) written by al-Muqaddasi in 985:

: &quot;The captain from the crow&#x27;s nest carefully observes the sea. When a rock is espied, he shouts: &quot;Starboard!&quot; or &#x27;Port!&quot; Two youths, posted there, repeat the cry. The helmsman, with two ropes in his hand, when he hears the calls tugs one or the other to the right or left. If great care is not taken, the ship strikes the rocks and is wrecked.&quot;

====Medieval Europe====
Oars mounted on the side of ships evolved into quarter steering oars, which were used from antiquity until the end of the Middle Ages in Europe. As the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased, quarter steering oars became unwieldy and were replaced by the more sturdy rudders with pintle and gudgeon attachment. While steering oars were found in Europe on a wide range of vessels since Roman times, including light war galleys in Mediterranean, the oldest known depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder can be found on church carvings of Zedelgem and Winchester dating to around 1180.

While earlier rudders were mounted on the stern by the way of rudderposts or tackles, the iron hinges allowed the rudder to be attached to the entire length of the sternpost in a permanent fashion. However, its full potential could only to be realized after the introduction of the vertical sternpost and the full-rigged ship in the 14th century. From the Age of Discovery onwards, European ships with pintle-and-gudgeon rudders sailed successfully on all seven seas.

Historian Joseph Needham holds that the stern-mounted rudder was transferred from China to Europe and the Islamic world during the Middle Ages.

====Modern rudders====
Conventional rudders have been essentially unchanged since Isambard Kingdom Brunel introduced the balanced rudder on the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; in 1843 and the steering engine in the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; in 1866. If a vessel requires extra maneuverability at low speeds, the rudder may be supplemented by a manoeuvring thruster in the bow, or be replaced entirely by azimuth thrusters.

==Boat rudders details==
Boat rudders may be either outboard or inboard. Outboard rudders are hung on the stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post that comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit. Inboard keel hung rudders (which are a continuation of the aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing. Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.

Rudder post and mast placement defines the difference between a ketch and a yawl, as these two-masted vessels are similar. Yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft (i.e. &quot;aft of&quot;) the rudder post; ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post.

Small boat rudders that can be steered more or less perpendicular to the hull&#x27;s longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed &quot;hard over.&quot; However, terms such as &quot;hard over,&quot; &quot;hard to starboard,&quot; etc. signify a maximum-rate turn for larger vessels. Transom hung rudders or far aft mounted fin rudders generate greater moment and faster turning than more forward mounted keel hung rudders. Rudders on smaller craft can be operated by means of a tiller that fits into the rudder stock that also forms the fixings to the rudder foil. Craft where the length of the tiller could impede movement of the helm can be split with a rubber universal joint and the part adjoined the tiller termed a tiller extension. Tillers can further be extended by means of adjustable telescopic twist locking extension.

There is also the barrel type rudder, where the ship&#x27;s screw is enclosed and can be swiveled to steer the vessel. Designers claim that this type of rudder on a smaller vessel will answer the helm faster.

===Rudder control===
Large ships (over 10,000 ton gross tonnage) have requirements on rudder turnover time. To comply with this, high torque rudder controls are employed. One commonly used system is the ram type steering gear. It employs four hydraulic rams to rotate the rudder stock (rotation axis), in turn rotating the rudder.

== Aircraft rudders == 

On an aircraft, a rudder is the directional control surface along with the rudder-like elevator (usually attached to the horizontal tail structure, if not a slab elevator) and ailerons (attached to the wings) that control pitch and roll, respectively. The rudder is usually attached to the fin (or vertical stabilizer), which allows the pilot to control yaw about the vertical axis, i.e., change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing.

Unlike a ship, both aileron and rudder controls are used together to turn an aircraft, with the ailerons imparting roll and the rudder imparting yaw and also compensating for a phenomenon called adverse yaw. A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction. Sometimes pilots may intentionally operate the rudder and ailerons in opposite directions in a maneuver called a slip or sideslip. This may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage in line with the runway, or to lose altitude by increasing drag, or both.

Another technique for yaw control, used on some tailless aircraft and flying wings, is to add one or more drag-creating surfaces, such as split ailerons, on the outer wing section. Operating one of these surfaces creates drag on the wing, causing the plane to yaw in that direction. These surfaces are often referred to as drag rudders.

Rudders are typically controlled with pedals.

<doc id="219796" wikidata="Q1018418" url="?curid=219796" title="Reigate">
<text>Reigate ( ) is a town in Surrey, England, around south of central London. The settlement is recorded in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cherchefelle&quot;, and first appears with its modern name in the 1190s. The earliest archaeological evidence for human activity is from the Paleolithic and Neolithic, and during the Roman period, tile-making took place to the north east of the modern centre.

A motte-and-bailey castle was erected in Reigate in the late 11th or early 12th century. It was originally constructed of timber, but the curtain walls were rebuilt in stone about a century later. An Augustinian priory was founded to the south of the modern town centre in the first half of the 13th century. The priory was closed during the Reformation and was rebuilt as a private residence for William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. The castle was abandoned around the same time and fell into disrepair.

During the medieval and early modern periods, Reigate was primarily an agricultural settlement. A weekly market began no later than 1279 and continued until 1895. Key crops included oats, hops and flax, but there is no record of rye being grown in the local area. The economy initially declined in the 18th century, as new turnpike roads allowed cheaper goods made outside the town to become available, undercutting local producers. Following the arrival of the railways in the mid-19th century, Reigate began to expand and the sale of much of the priory estate in 1921 released further land for housebuilding.

Reigate is part of the London commuter belt, and since 1974 it has been one of four towns in the borough of Reigate and Banstead. The borough council is based at the town hall in Castlefield Road, and Surrey County Council has its headquarters at Woodhatch Place. Much of the North Downs, to the north of Reigate, is owned by the National Trust, including Colley Hill, above ordnance datum (OD) and Reigate Hill above OD.

==Toponymy==
In Domesday Book of 1089, Reigate appears as &quot;Cherchefelle&quot; and in the 12th century, it is recorded as &quot;Crichefeld&quot; and &quot;Crechesfeld&quot;. The name is thought to mean &quot;open space by the hill or barrow&quot;.

The name &quot;Reigate&quot; first appears in written sources in the 1190s. Similar forms are also recorded in the late medieval period, including &quot;Reigata&quot; in 1170, &quot;Regate&quot; in 1203, &quot;Raygate&quot; in 1235, &quot;Rigate&quot; in 1344 and &quot;Reighgate&quot; in 1604. The name is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;rǣge&quot; meaning &quot;roe deer&quot; and the Middle English &quot;gate&quot;, which might indicate an enclosure gate or pass through which deer were hunted. It has also been suggested that the &quot;rei&quot; element may have evolved from the Middle English &quot;ray&quot;, meaning a marshland or referring to a stream; this theory is considered unlikely as the Old English form of this word is &quot;ree&quot; rather than &quot;rey&quot;.

Woodhatch may derive from the Old English word &quot;hæc&quot; meaning &quot;gate&quot;, and the name may mean &quot;gate to the wood&quot;. It is possible, in this instance, that the &quot;wood&quot; referred to is the Weald. In 1623, a survey of the manor of Reigate noted a &quot;Bowling Alley lying before the gate of the Tenement called Woodhatch&quot;. Alternatively, the name may derive from that of a local resident: A &quot;Thomas ate Chert&quot; is recorded as living at the settlement in the early 14th century and &quot;Woodhatch&quot; might instead mean &quot;woodland of the ate Chert family&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location and topography===
Reigate is in central Surrey, around south of central London and north of Gatwick Airport. The town is in the Vale of Holmesdale, below the North Downs escarpment. The average elevation in the centre is above ordnance datum (OD) and the area is drained by the Wallace Brook and its tributaries, which feed the River Mole.

===Geology===
Woodhatch lies on the Weald Clay, a sedimentary rock primarily consisting of mudstone that was deposited in the early Cretaceous. Much of Reigate is on the strata of the Lower Greensand Group. This group is multi-layered and includes the sandy Hythe Beds overlain by the clayey Sandgate Beds, which together form the high ground of Priory Park. Reigate Heath and the town centre are on quartz-rich Folkestone Beds and the water-filled part of the castle moat is dug into narrow band of clay present in the sandstone. To the north of the railway line is the Gault Formation, a stiff, blue-black, shaly clay, deposited in a deep-water marine environment. At the base of the North Downs is a thin outcrop of Upper Greensand, above which lies the Chalk Group.
Weald clay was dug for brickmaking at Brown&#x27;s Brickyard in Woodhatch. Building sand was excavated from Barnards Pit, to the west of the town, and at Wray Common Road to the east. Seams of silver sand which occur in the Folkestone Beds were quarried for glass making and the caves beneath the castle may originally have been excavated for this purpose, before being used as cellars. There is also evidence of ironstone extraction in the town, although this practice is thought to have ceased by 1650.

Reigate Stone was mined from the Upper Greensand from medieval times until the mid-20th century and was used in the construction of several local buildings, including the castle, Reigate Priory and St Mary&#x27;s Church. To the north of the town are the remains of several old chalk pits and lime is thought to have been produced at a site at the base of Colley Hill, although the age of the workings is uncertain.

==History==
===Early history===

The earliest evidence of human activity in the Reigate area is a triangular stone axe from the Paleolithic, which was found in Woodhatch in 1936. Worked flints from the later Neolithic have been found on Colley Hill. Finds from the Bronze Age include a gold penannular ring, dated to BCE, and a barbed spearhead from Priory Park. The eight barrows on Reigate Heath are thought to date from the same period, when the surrounding area may have been marshland.
During the Roman period, the Doods Road area was a centre for tile-making. An excavation in 2014 uncovered the remains of a 2nd- or 3rd-century kiln with several types of tile, identified as &quot; tegulae&quot;, &quot;imbrices&quot; and &quot;pedales&quot;. Artefacts discovered to the south west of the town centre in 2011 suggest that there was a high-status villa nearby. Coins from the reigns of Vespasian (69–79), Hadrian (117–138), Severus Alexander (222–235) and Arcadius (383–408), indicate that there was Roman activity in the local area throughout the occupation of Britain.

The former name &quot;Cherchefelle&quot; suggests that the most recent period of permanent settlement in Reigate began in Anglo-Saxon times. The main settlement is thought to have been located in the area of the parish church, to the east of the modern centre, although much of the population was probably thinly dispersed around the parish. Excavations in Church Street in the late 1970s uncovered a Saxon glass jar and remains of a skeleton of uncertain age, but archaeological evidence from this period elsewhere in the town is sparse.

===Governance===
Reigate appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cherchefelle&quot;. It was held by William the Conqueror, who had assumed the lordship in 1075 on the death of Edith of Wessex, widow of Edward the Confessor. The settlement included two mills worth 11s 10d, land for 29 plough teams, woodland and herbage for 140 swine, pasture for 43 pigs and of meadow. The manor rendered £40 per year in 1086 and the residents included 67 villagers and 11 smallholders. The Domesday Book also records that the town was part of the larger Hundred of Cherchefelle.

The non-corporate Borough of Reigate, covering roughly the town centre, was formed in 1295. It elected two MPs until the Reform Act 1832 when it lost one. In 1868, Reigate borough was disenfranchised for corruption, but representation in the House of Commons was restored to the town in the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. 23).

The manor of &quot;Cherchefelle&quot; was granted to William de Warenne when he became Earl of Surrey and under his patronage, Reigate began to thrive. The castle was constructed shortly afterwards and the modern town was established to the south in the late 12th century. An Augustinian priory, founded by the fifth Earl of Surrey, is recorded in 1240. By 1276, a regular market was being held and a record of 1291 describes Reigate as a Borough. On the death of the seventh Earl, John de Warenne, in 1347, the manor passed to his brother-in-law, Richard Fitzalan, the third Earl of Arundel. In 1580 both Earldoms passed through the female line to Phillip Howard, whose father, Thomas Howard, had forfeited the title of Duke of Norfolk and had been executed for his involvement in the Ridolfi plot to assassinate Elizabeth I. The dukedom was restored to the family in 1660, following the accession of Charles II.

Reforms during the Tudor period reduced the importance of manorial courts and the day-to-day administration of towns such as Reigate became the responsibility of the vestry of the parish church. By the early 17th century, the ecclesiastical parish had been divided for administrative purposes into two parts: the &quot;Borough of Reigate&quot;, which broadly corresponded to the modern town centre, and &quot;Reigate Foreign&quot;, which included the five petty boroughs of Santon, Colley, Woodhatch, Linkfield and Hooley. The two parts were reunited in 1863 as a Municipal Borough with a council of elected representatives chaired by a mayor. The Borough was extended in 1933 to include Horley, Merstham, Buckland and Nutfield.

The Local Government Act 1972 created Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, by combining the Reigate Borough with Banstead Urban District and the eastern part of the Dorking and Horley Rural District. Since its inception in 1974, the council has been based in the Town Hall in Castlefield Road, Reigate.

===Reigate Castle===
Reigate Castle was built in the late 11th or early 12th century, most likely by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey. Taking the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, it was originally constructed of timber, but the curtain walls were rebuilt in stone around a century later. A water-filled moat section was dug into the clay on the north side and a dry ditch was excavated around the remainder of the structure. The large size of the motte indicates that the castle was designed both as a fortification and as the lord&#x27;s residence from the outset.

Following the dissolution of the monasteries, the lords of the manor moved their primary residence to Reigate Priory, to the south of the town. The castle was allowed to decay, with only small outlays recorded in the manor accounts for repairs, until 1686, when the buildings were reported as ruinous. Much of the masonry was most likely removed for local construction projects, but in around 1777, Richard Barnes, who rented the grounds, built a new gatehouse folly using the remaining stone. A century later, the Borough Council was granted a long lease on the property, which had been turned into a public garden. Regular tours of the caves beneath the castle are run by the Wealden Cave and Mine Society.

===Reigate Priory===
William de Warenne, the fifth Earl of Surrey, is thought to have founded the Augustinian priory at Reigate before 1240. Early documents refer to the priory as a hospital, but in 1334 it is described as a convent and thereafter as a purely religious institution. The priory was built to the south of the modern town centre and a series of fish ponds was constructed in the grounds. Although the exact layout is uncertain, the buildings are thought to have been arranged around a central square cloister, with the church on the north side and the refectory on the south.
In 1541, Henry VIII granted the former priory to William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham, the uncle of Katherine Howard. The old church was converted to a private residence and the majority of the rest of the buildings were demolished. Richard Ireland, who purchased the priory in 1766, is primarily responsible for the appearance of the buildings today. A fire destroyed much of the west wing and Ireland commissioned its rebuilding. Following Ireland&#x27;s death in 1780, the priory passed through a succession of owners, including Lady Henry Somerset, who remodelled the grounds between 1883 and 1895, creating a sunken garden. Following her death in 1921, the estate was divided for sale and much of the land was purchased for housebuilding.

The final private owner of the house was the racehorse trainer, Peter Beatty, who sold it to the Mutual Property Life and General Insurance Company, which relocated from London for the second half of the Second World War. In 1948, the borough council bought the grounds, having secured them as Public Open Space three years earlier. Also in 1948, the Reigate Priory County Secondary School opened in the main priory building, with 140 children aged 13 and 14. In 1963 the boys moved to Woodhatch School and the Priory School continued as an all-girls secondary school. In 1971, the secondary school closed and Holmesdale Middle School, which had been founded in 1852, moved to the priory.

===Transport and communications===

In medieval times, the main road north from Reigate followed Nutley Lane, climbing Colley Hill in the direction of Kingston upon Thames, from where produce and manufactured items could be transported via the River Thames. Although the direct route to London via Merstham had a less severe gradient, it appears to have been little used for the transport of goods. The manor of Reigate was responsible for maintaining the roads in the local area, but repairs were carried out infrequently and improvements were often only funded by private donations. In 1555, the responsibility for local infrastructure was transferred to the parish, and separate surveyors were employed for the Borough and for Reigate Foreign. The inefficiency created by this division resulted in frequent complaints and court cases relating to the poor state of the roads and so, in 1691, local justices of the peace were given the role of appointing the surveyors.

The first turnpike trust in Surrey was authorised by Parliament in 1697 to improve the road south from Woodhatch towards Crawley. The new road took the form of a bridleway, laid alongside the existing causeway between the River Mole crossing at Sidlow and Horse Hill, and was unsuitable for wheeled vehicles. Repairs were also carried out on the route between Reigate and Woodhatch under the same Act. A second turnpike was authorised in 1755, to improve the route from Sutton to Povey Cross, near Horley, which involved creating a new road north from Reigate over Reigate Hill. A cutting was excavated at the top of the hill, using a battering ram to break up the underlying chalk.
The new route was completed the following year and the old road via Nutley Lane was blocked at Colley Hill. In 1808, a second turnpike to the north was opened to Purley via Merstham. The new trust was required to pay £200 per year to the owners of the Reigate Hill road, in compensation for lost tolls.
Two improvements to the road network in the town centre took place in the early nineteenth century. Firstly, in 1815, the Wray Stream, was culverted to improve the drainage and road surface of Bell Street. Secondly, Reigate Tunnel, the first road tunnel in England, was constructed at the expense of John Cocks, 1st Earl Somers the lord of the manor. Opened in 1823, it runs beneath the castle and links Bell Street to London Road. It enabled road traffic to bypass the tight curves at the west end of the town centre, but is now only used by pedestrians. The Borough Council became responsible for local roads on its formation in 1865. The final tolls were removed from the turnpikes in 1881.

The first station to serve Reigate area was at Hooley, Earlswood and opened in 1841. The following year, the South Eastern Railway opened the , which was initially named Reigate Junction. The railway line through Reigate was constructed by the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway and opened in 1849. It was designed to provide an alternative route between the west of England and the Channel ports, and serving intermediate towns was a secondary concern. Electrification of the section of line from Reigate to Redhill was completed on 1 January 1933.

In February 1976, Reigate was joined to the UK motorway system when the M25 was opened between Reigate Hill and Godstone. The section to Wisley via Leatherhead was opened in October 1985.

===Economy and commerce===
From much of its early history, Reigate was primarily an agricultural settlement. At the time of the Norman conquest, the common fields covered some and in 1623 the total area of arable land was around . From the early 17th century, the manor began to specialise in the production of oatmeal for the Royal Navy, possibly due to the influence of Admiral Charles Howard, who lived at the priory. By 1710, 11.5% of the population was employed in cereal processing, but the trade dwindled in the mid-18th century and had ceased by 1786. Until the early 18th century, most goods were traded locally, but thereafter, London is thought to have become the most important market for produce.

The market in Reigate is first recorded in 1279, when John de Warenne, the 6th Earl of Surrey, claimed the right to hold a weekly market on Saturdays and five annual fairs. His son John, the 7th Earl, was granted permission to move the event to Tuesdays in 1313. The original market place was to the west of the castle, in the triangle of land now bordered by West Street, Upper West Street and Slipshoe Street (where the former route to Kingston diverged from the road to Guildford). It moved to the widest part of the High Street, close to the junction with Bell Street, in the 18th century. Cattle ceased to be sold in the late 19th century and the market closed in 1895, in part as a result of the opening of a fortnightly market in Redhill in 1870.

Reigate has two surviving windmills: a post mill on Reigate Heath and a tower mill on Wray Common. In the early modern period, the parish had at least three other windmills and about a dozen animal-powered mills for oatmeal. In addition, there were watermills along the southern boundary of the parish, on the Mole and Redhill Brook.
Although the opening of the Reigate Hill turnpike in 1755 provided an easier route to transport produce and manufactured items to London, the new road appears initially to have had a negative impact on the local economy, as goods produced elsewhere became cheaper than those made in the town itself. As a result, there was little growth in the population between the 1720s and 1821. In the late 18th century, the prosperity of the town began to recover as it became as stopping point on the London to Brighton coaching route. In 1793, over half of the traffic on the Reigate Hill turnpike was bound for the south coast and numbers swelled as a result of troop movements during the Napoleonic Wars. The opening of the turnpike through Redhill, appears to have had little initial impact on the numbers travelling through the town, as travellers preferred to break their journeys in Reigate, rather than bypassing the town to the east.

===Residential development===
Reigate began to expand following the arrival of the railway lines in the 1840s. At first, development was focused in the east of the parish. A new settlement, initially known as Warwick Town, was established on land owned by Sarah Greville, Countess of Warwick in the 1820s and 1830s. In 1856, the post office relocated its local branch to the growing village and the area became known as Redhill. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, Redhill expanded westwards towards Reigate town centre and the two towns are now contiguous.
A new residential area was established at Wray Park, to the north of Reigate town centre, in the 1850s and 1860s. St Mark&#x27;s Church was built to serve the new community. Doods Road was constructed in around 1864 and Somers Road, to the west of the station, followed shortly afterwards. In 1863, the National Freehold Land Society began to develop the Glovers Field estate, to the south east of the town centre, and also led efforts to build houses at South Park, to the west of Woodhatch.

At the end of the 19th century, the estates of several large houses were broken up, releasing further land for development. Glovers and Lesborne Roads, to the south east of the centre, were developed by the National Freehold Land Company . The Great Doods estate, between the railway line and Reigate Road, was sold in 1897 and the first houses in Deerings Road appeared shortly afterwards. A major development occurred in 1921, when the Reigate Priory estate (which included much of the land in the town) was sold, enabling existing leaseholders to purchase the freehold of their properties and freeing up further land for construction.
In the early 20th century, South Park continued to expand to the south and east. The sale of Woodhatch Farm in the 1930s released the land for housebuilding. Further expansion in Woodhatch occurred in the 1950s, with the construction of council housing on the Rushetts Farm estate.

===Reigate in wartime===
Although little fighting took place in Surrey during the Civil War, the Reigate Hundred was required to provide 80 men for the Parliamentarian army, but a force of only 60 was raised, including a captain and lieutenant. Troops were garrisoned in the town and by the summer of 1648, serious discontent was rising in the local area as a result. The Royalist, Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland, raised a fighting force and marched from Kingston to Reigate where his men plundered local property and briefly occupied the half-ruined castle. Parliamentary troops under Major Lewis Audley were sent to confront Rich, but he withdrew first to Dorking and then the following day back to Kingston. The withdrawal of the Royalists from Reigate was the final incident in the Civil War south of the River Thames before the execution of Charles I in 1649.

In September 1914, Reigate became a garrison town. Members of the London&#x27;s Own Territorials were billeted locally whilst undergoing training in the area and Reigate Lodge was used as an Army Service Corps supply depot. Reigate railway station was closed between January 1917 and February 1919 as a wartime economy measure.

By the end of the First World War, there were three temporary hospitals for members of the armed forces in Reigate. The Hillfield Red Cross Hospital opened on 2 November 1914 and was equipped with an operating theatre and 50 beds. As well as treating injured soldiers transported home from overseas, the facility also treated troops garrisoned locally. The Kitto Relief Hospital in South Park opened on 9 November 1914, initially as an annex to the Hillfield Hospital, but from 28 September 1915 it was affiliated to the Horton Hospital in Epsom. The Beeches Auxiliary Military Hospital, on Beech Road, was opened in March 1916 with 20 beds, but expanded to 40 beds that October. The hospital relocated to a larger facility in the same road in July 1917 and became affiliated with the Lewisham Military Hospital two months later.
Some 5000 evacuees from London were sent to the Reigate and Redhill area at the start of the Second World War in September 1939, but by February of the following year around 2000 had returned home. The caves beneath Reigate Castle were converted for use as public air raid shelters and the first bombing raid on the town took place on 15 August 1940. There was a succession of raids in November 1940, including on the 7th when Colley Hill and Reigate Hill were attacked. Towards the end of the war, in 1944, the Tea House café on top of Reigate Hill was destroyed by a V-1 flying bomb.

For much of the war, Reigate was the headquarters of the South Eastern Command of the British Army. The command was partly housed in purpose-built tunnels beneath Reigate Hill, excavated in 1939 by Welsh miners. The complex consisted of four large underground halls, linked by a network of passageways dug through the chalk. The entrances to the tunnels were destroyed in 1968, after several people had been injured in unauthorised attempts to access the site.

During the Second World War, the defence of the town was primarily the responsibility of the 8th Surrey Battalion of the Home Guard, although the East Surrey Water Company and the London Passenger Transport Board formed separate units to defend local infrastructure. Tank traps in the castle grounds were among the defences installed in the town. Before being deployed to the Western Front, the 1st Battalion of the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (part of the Canadian Army, was encamped locally. On 19 March 1945 a U.S. Air Force B17G, returning from a bombing raid in Germany, crashed into Reigate Hill in low-visibility conditions. Two memorial benches, carved in the shape of wing tips, were installed as a memorial at the crash site 70 years later.

==National and local government==
The town is in the parliamentary constituency of Reigate and has been represented at Westminster since July 2024 by Conservative Rebecca Paul. A previous MP, George Gardiner, was elected MP in 1974, but defected from the Conservatives to the Referendum Party two months before the 1997 general election. Geoffrey Howe, later briefly Deputy Prime Minister under Margaret Thatcher, represented Reigate from 1970 to 1974. 
In January 2021, the Surrey County Council moved its headquarters from Kingston upon Thames to Woodhatch Place at 11 Cockshott Hill, in the Woodhatch area of Reigate. Two councillors, elected every four years, represent the town:

Six councillors sit on Reigate and Banstead borough council, which operates a council-elected-in-thirds system, allowing electors to vote for one candidate in three out of every four years:
The borough is twinned with Brunoy (Île-de-France, France) and Eschweiler (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany).

==Demography and housing==
In the 2011 Census, the population of the Reigate built-up area, including Woodhatch, was 22,123.

Across the South East Region, 28% of homes were detached houses and 22.6% were apartments.

==Public services==
===Utilities===
Reigate Water Works Company was established in 1858. It opened a plant on Littleton Lane the following year, to supply drinking water to the town from the Wallace Brook. It was purchased by the East Surrey Water Company in 1896, which closed the Reigate works after extending its mains network to the town from Caterham. The first sewerage system in Reigate was installed in 1876 and included a main outfall sewer running under Bell Street via Woodhatch to the treatment works at Earlswood Common.

Reigate Gas Company was formed in 1838 and opened a gasworks on London Road a year later. Initially it was contracted to supply gas for 28 street lights in the town centre, but by 1860, increasing domestic demand necessitated the opening of a larger facility at the north end of Nutley Lane. In 1921, the Reigate company was taken over by the Redhill Gas Company, which had been formed in 1865.
An electricity generating station was authorised by the Reigate Electric Lighting Order 1897 and constructed in a former sand quarry next to the railway line off Wray Common Road. On opening it had an installed capacity of 230 kW, but by the time of its closure in 1936, the maximum power output had risen to 2.7 MW. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, Reigate was connected to the National Grid, initially to a 33 kV supply ring, which linked the town to Croydon, Dorking, Epsom and Leatherhead. In 1939, the ring was connected to the Wimbledon-Woking main via a 132 kV substation at Leatherhead.

===Emergency services===

The Borough police force was founded in 1864 and initially consisted of a superintendent, a sergeant and eight constables. The original police station was in West Street, but was moved to the High Street in around 1866 and to the Municipal Buildings around the turn of the century. A new police station was opened in Reigate Road in 1972, coinciding with the merger of the Borough force with the Surrey Constabulary.

In 1809, two fire engines were presented to the vestry, which was charged with appointing a group of six men to operate it when needed. The brigade was expanded to 12 members in 1854. A new fire station, with a four-storey tower and a pagoda style roof, opened next to the new town hall in Castlefield Road in 1901. The brigade moved to Croydon Road in 1955. In 2021, the fire authority for Reigate is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. The Ambulance Community Response Post, located at the fire station, is run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.

===Healthcare===
The nearest accident &amp; emergency department is at East Surrey Hospital (). As of 2023, the GP practice is in Yorke Road.

==Economy==

At one time the airline Air Europe had its head office in Europe House in Reigate. Redland plc, the FTSE 100 building materials company, was headquartered in Reigate before its acquisition by Lafarge, and its former headquarters are now occupied by the insurance company esure.

Canon UK had its headquarters on the southern outskirts of Reigate. The building, opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in 2000, has won numerous design and &#x27;green&#x27; awards.

The European headquarters of Kimberly-Clark are on London Road in the town, just south of Reigate railway station. Further along London Road towards the town centre can be found the former European headquarters of Willis Towers Watson, prior to the merger with Willis, when the global and British headquarters relocated to Lime Street in London.

Pilgrim Brewery was founded in 1982 and moved to West Street in 1984. It was the first new brewery to be established in Surrey for over a century.

==Transport==
===Public transport===

===Maintained schools===
There are several primary schools in Reigate. Dovers Green School and Wray Common Primary School are members of the Greensand Multi-Academy Trust. Sandcross Primary School is part of the Everychild Trust.

Reigate Parish Church Primary School was founded as the Reigate National School. Originally in West Street, it moved to London Road in 1854 and then to Blackborough Road in 1995.

Reigate Priory Junior School traces its origins to a non-denominational school, founded in 1852 in the High Street. It moved to Holmesdale Road in the 1860s and in 1993 moved to the priory, taking over the classrooms previously used by Reigate Priory Middle School. The school educates children between the ages of 7 and 11 and is due to move to new premises on Cockshott Hill in 2023.
Reigate School is a coeducational secondary school in Woodhatch. It educates children aged 11 to 16. It is part of the Greensand Multi-Academy Trust. It opened as the Woodhatch County Secondary School in September 1958.

The Royal Alexandra and Albert School traces its origins to an orphanage for children of Dissenters, founded in Hoxton, London in 1759. The orphanage expanded rapidly and by 1769 had 28 boys and 25 girls between the ages of 6 and 9 in its care. It relocated several times during the following two centuries and, in 1943 it was renamed the Royal Alexandra School and was based on a site at Duxhurst, near Salfords. A separate institution, the Royal Albert Orphan Asylum was founded near Bagshot in 1864 and admitted its first 100 children in December of that year. It was renamed the Royal Albert School in 1942. The management of the Royal Alexandra and the Royal Albert Schools was merged in 1948 and the new organisation purchased the Gatton Park estate. The following year, an Act of Parliament was passed to formally amalgamate the two institutions. Boarding accommodation was constructed at Gatton Park in 1950 and pupils were relocated from the Bagshot and Duxhurst sites in stages between 1948 and 1954. Today, the Royal Alexandra and Albert School is a coeducational maintained boarding school, educating 1125 children between the ages of 7 and 18.
Reigate College is a coeducational sixth form college for students aged 16 to 19. It opened in 1976 on Castlefield Road, to the east of the town centre. The main building, constructed in 1927, was previously occupied by the Reigate County School for Girls and was designed by the architecture firm Jarvis and Porter.

===Independent schools===
Micklefield School was founded in 1910 and takes its name from its original location, Micklefield House in Evesham Road. It moved to its current site in Somers Road, to the north of the town centre, in 1925. In 2021, Micklefield is a coeducational, independent day school for children aged 2 to 11.

Reigate St Mary&#x27;s School was founded in 1950 as the choir school for St Mary&#x27;s Church. Initially for boys only, it became coeducational in 2003, when it was made the principal feeder school for Reigate Grammar School. In 2021, Reigate St Mary&#x27;s is a coeducational day school for children aged 2 to 11.
Reigate Grammar School traces its origins to 1675, when Henry Smith, an Alderman of the City of London, left a bequest of £150 for the purchase of land for a &quot;free school&quot;. The first master, Revd John Williamson, was the vicar of Reigate and for the first two centuries, several headmasters were also parish priests. The school became a grammar school in 1861 and around this time many of the original buildings were replaced. The school was taken over by Surrey County Council under the Education Act 1944, but became independent in 1976. In the same year, girls were admitted to the sixth form and the school became fully coeducational in 1993. It merged with Reigate St Mary&#x27;s Prep School and Chinthurst School in 2003 and 2017 and, as of 2021, the three school together educate around 1,500 pupils aged from 3 to 18. An international division was created in 2017, to work in partnership with the Kaiyuan Education Fund, to establish up to five schools in China.
Dunottar School was founded in 1926 and is named after Dunottar Castle in Aberdeenshire, where the Scottish Crown Jewels were kept between 1651 and 1660. In 1933, the school moved to its current site, the former High Trees house, which had been built in 1867. In 2021, Dunottar is a co-educational independent day school for children aged 11 to 18. It became part of United Learning in 2014.

===Other schools===
Reigate Valley College at Sidlow, just south of the town, is a former pupil referral unit that educates pupils who have had behavioural issues in mainstream schools. There are two schools in the town for students with special educational needs: Brooklands School on Wray Park Road and Moon Hall College at Flanchford Bridge near Leigh.

==Places of worship==
===Church of St Mary Magdalene===

The first record of a church at Reigate is from the late 12th century, when the church of &quot;Crechesfeld&quot; was presented to the Priory of St Mary Overie by Hamelin and Isabel de Warenne, the Earl and Countess of Surrey. At the time of the gift, the church is thought to have consisted of a nave, chancel and possibly a central tower. The oldest parts of today&#x27;s date from . The building was extended several times in the late medieval period, including the additions of the north and south aisles in the mid-late 13th century, the south chancel chapel in the 14th century and the relocation of the tower to the west end in the first half of the 15th century. Two phases of reconstruction took place in Victorian times. In 1845, the architect, Henry Woodyer, was responsible for renewing the local Reigate Stone walls and, in 1874–7, George Gilbert Scott Jr. installed new roofing and refaced the tower in Bath Stone.

The medieval rood screen, separating the chancel from the nave, was restored by Woodyer, who was also responsible for much of the current stained glass. There are several 17th- and 18th-century monuments inside the church, the largest of which is a memorial to Richard Labroke (d. 1730) who is depicted in Roman dress, flanked by the figures of Justice and Truth.

===Reigate Mill Church===

Reigate Heath Windmill was built and was last worked by wind in 1862. The weatherboarded upper section of the post mill holds the sails and sits above the brick roundhouse below. The roundhouse was converted into a chapel of ease to the Church of St Mary Magdalen in 1880 and services are held in the building during the summer months. It is thought to be the only windmill to be used as a church in England.

===Reigate Heath Church===
Reigate Heath Church, on Flanchford Road, was built in 1907 as a chapel of ease to St Mary Magdalen. It is constructed from corrugated galvanised iron and is typical of the tin tabernacles, built around the same time.

===St Mark&#x27;s Church===

St Mark&#x27;s Church, in Alma Road, was opened in 1860 to serve a new area of housing, under construction to the north of the railway station. It was designed by the architects firm, Field &amp; Hilton, and is built in Reigate Stone. The tower and spire were added in 1863, but the spire was demolished in 1919. The church was heavily damaged during the Second World War, necessitating the demolition of the south transept. Most of the windows were destroyed by bomb blasts and a new East Window, designed by Francis Spear, was installed in 1955.

===St Philip&#x27;s Church===
St Philip&#x27;s Church, to the north west of the town centre, was built in 1863, originally as a chapel of ease to St Mark&#x27;s Church. The pulpit dates from 1898 and the reredos was installed in 1919. Following the First World War, the east end of the church was reordered to raise the floor level and the chancel was enlarged into the nave in 1957.

===St Luke&#x27;s Church===
St Luke&#x27;s Church, to the south of the town, was opened in 1871. It is constructed from Reigate Stone and is built in the Gothic style. The west end was damaged during a storm in the 1960s and the affected wall was replaced by a clear-glazed window. The church was extended to the west, with the addition of an annex, which provides accommodation for the Winter Night Shelter.

===Reigate Methodist Church===

Although John Wesley visited Reigate four times between 1770 and 1775, the first Methodist chapel was not established in the town until 1858. The current church, in the High Street, was built in 1884.

===Catholic Church of the Holy Family===
The Catholic Church of the Holy Family was built in Yorke Road, on land donated by a local benefactor. It was consecrated in 1939. A mass centre was established in a wooden building in Woodhatch, but was closed in 2003 after almost 50 years of use.

===Art===

Reigate Priory Museum holds an early-16th century portrait of John Lymden, the final Prior of Reigate. The Town Hall holds several artworks, including paintings by Henry Tanworth Wells (18281903), George Leon Little (18621941) and George Hooper (19101994).

===Golf===

Reigate Heath Golf Club was founded in 1895. Permission to create a 9-hole course on the heath was granted on the condition that male and female club members had equal rights. The course was formally opened on 20 February 1897; the clubhouse was completed shortly afterwards, but was extensively remodelled in 1969.

The 18-hole Reigate Hill Golf Club course was laid out as a par 72 course by the designer, David Williams. The club, at Gatton Bottom, was officially opened in November 1995 by professional golfers David Gilford and Andrew Murray.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Cranston Library===
The Cranston Library was opened in 1701 and is the oldest public lending library in England. It was intended primarily for the use of the clergy of the Archdeaconry of Ewell, but its remit was expanded in 1708, to maintain a collection of books &quot;for the use and perusal of the Freeholders, Vicar and Inhabitants&quot; of Reigate Parish &quot;and of the Gentlemen and Clergymen inhabiting parts thereunto adjacent.&quot; The library is named after its founder, Andrew Cranston who was the Vicar of Reigate from 1697 to 1708. It is housed on the first floor of the vestry of the Church of St Mary Magdalene. The collection includes over 2000 books, most of which date from the 17th and 18th centuries.

===Town Hall===
The current town hall was completed in 1901 to replace the old town hall in the High Street. It was designed by Macintosh and Newman in the Arts and Crafts style and was originally known as the Municipal Buildings. On opening, it also housed the police station and courts, but the police moved to new premises in Reigate Road in 1943 and the courts service vacated the building in the early 1970s. The town hall has been the headquarters of Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, since its inception on 1 April 1974.

===Old Town Hall===

The old town hall, at the east end of the High Street, was constructed in around 1728. It was built on the site of a chapel, dedicated to St Thomas Becket that was existence before 1330. Following the Reformation, the chapel became a market house. It was demolished in around 1785 and was replaced by the current red brick structure. The building served as the headquarters of Reigate Municipal Borough Council from its formation in 1863 until the borough council moved to the new town hall in Castlefield Road in 1901. Randal Vogan purchased the old town hall in 1922 and presented it to the Borough Council.

===Reigate Fort===
Reigate Fort, on Reigate Hill, is one of 13 London Defence Positions, built in the 1890s. They were primarily designed as infantry redoubts, to be used in the event of an invasion by the French. The Reigate Fort was completed in 1898 and is one of the largest in the defensive line. It was defended by an earth rampart and had a clear view south over Reigate. Among the surviving buildings is a magazine, which would have been used for storing ammunition. Reigate Fort was declared redundant in 1907 and the land was sold. During the First World War, it was used as an ammunition store and is thought to have been used as a communications station for the British Army South East Command in the Second World War. The fort was restored in the early 2000s and is open to the public.

===Reigate Hill Footbridge===

Reigate Hill Footbridge carries the North Downs Way over the A217 to the north of the town. It was completed in 1910 and has a span of . It was built using the Hennebique method of construction and is one of the earliest reinforced concrete bridges in England. It replaced an earlier chain suspension bridge, which was built in 1825.

===Wray Common Windmill===

Wray Common Windmill was built in 1824 and is to the northeast of the town centre. It is a tower mill constructed of tarred bricks with a metal cap. The mill was used to grind corn until 1895, when it became an agricultural store. It was converted into a four-storey private residence in the 1960s. The building underwent a programme of restoration between 2004 and 2007, which included the installation of new, non-functioning sails.

==Parks and open spaces==

Castle Gardens were laid out in the 1870s and cover an area of about . They were leased to the Borough Council by Lord Somers in 1873, but the freehold was not acquired by the council until 1921. A stone pyramid on top of the motte acts as a sally port to the Barons&#x27; Cave below.
Colley Hill, to the northwest of the town, is part of the North Downs escarpment. were donated to the borough council in 1910 and the remainder was purchased by the National Trust in 1913. The Inglis Memorial, originally a drinking fountain for horses, was given to the Borough of Reigate by Robert Inglis in 1909. The ceiling of the memorial is decorated with an ornate blue and gold mosaic.

Lower Gatton Park, around north of Reigate, is a area of parkland on the south-facing lower slopes of the North Downs. It has its origins as a medieval deer park, which was created from the demesne lands of the manor of Gatton. It was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 1760s and 1770s and includes an ornamental lake. The park is open to the public on the first Sunday of each month from February to October.

The southern part of Priory Park was purchased by Randal Vogan in 1920, who donated the land to the Borough Council &quot;to be preserved in its natural beauty for the use and quiet enjoyment of the public&quot;. The remainder of the priory grounds were acquired by the borough council in 1948. In 2007, the Borough Council began a restoration project, partly funded by a £4.2M lottery grant. The pavilion, designed by the architect, Dominique Perrault, was constructed as part of the project and houses a cafe. The park offers a children&#x27;s play area, tennis courts and a skate park, as well as walking trails, formal gardens and a lake.
Reigate Heath is a Site of Special Scientific Interest to the west of the town centre. The primary habitats are open heath and acid grassland, where the dominant species are common heather, bell heather and wavy hair-grass. Petty whin, soft trefoil and bird&#x27;s-foot fenugreek are also found in these areas. The site also includes Alder woodland, home to species such as the common bluebell, marsh violet, marsh pennywort and the rare white sedge. At the eastern edge of the heath is an area of marshy meadow, a habitat not found elsewhere in Surrey, which supports meadowsweet, wild angelica, marsh marigolds and the southern marsh orchid.

South Park, to the west of Woodhatch, is a recreation ground managed by the South Park Sports Association. Facilities include sports pitches and a children&#x27;s playground. A new pump track for mountain bike and BMX riders, funded by two £20,000 grants, was opened in December 2021. The park has been protected by the Fields in Trust charity since October 1934.

<text>Lake Washington () is a large freshwater lake adjacent to the city of Seattle, Washington, United States. It is the largest lake in King County and the second largest natural lake in the state of Washington, after Lake Chelan. It borders the cities of Seattle on the west, Bellevue and Kirkland on the east, Renton on the south, and Kenmore on the north, and encloses Mercer Island. The lake is fed by the Sammamish River at its north end and the Cedar River at its south.

Lake Washington has been known to the Duwamish and other Indigenous peoples living on the lake for millennia as (lit. &quot;lake&quot; in Lushootseed). At the time of European settlement, it was recorded as At-sar-kal in a map sketched by engineer Abiel W. Tinkham; and the Chinook Jargon name, (&quot;great/large water&quot;), was also used. Other English names historically used for the lake include Lake Geneva by Isaac N. Ebey; and Lake Duwamish in railroad surveys under Governor Isaac Stevens. Lake Washington received its present name in 1854 after Thomas Mercer suggested it be named after George Washington, as the new Washington Territory had been named the year before.

The lake provides boating and sport fishing opportunities. Some fish species found in its waters include sockeye salmon, coho salmon, Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and black crappie.

Lake Washington has two passenger seaplane bases: Kenmore Air Harbor on its north end; and Will Rogers – Wiley Post Memorial Seaplane Base on its south end, adjacent to Renton Municipal Airport.

==Geography==
Lake Washington&#x27;s basin was formed by glacial processes associated with the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Vashon Glaciation, likely through a combination of preferential erosion of weak rock and sediments by the glacier itself and by subglacial meltwater during the glacier&#x27;s retreat. At the end of the Pleistocene, the basin that is now Lake Washington connected directly to the channels of Puget Sound through the north end of the Duwamish Valley. The basin may or may not have been a waterway at this point, as eustatic sea levels were approximately 150 meters (490 feet) lower than at present and the land around Seattle was ~75-85 meters (245-280 feet) lower due to isostatic depression from the weight of the glacier. However, the rapid sea level rise from the end of the Pleistocene through the early Holocene had flooded the Duwamish Valley and Lake Washington within a couple thousand years. Lake Washington did not become a freshwater lake, isolated from Puget Sound, until some time after 5,700 years Before Present, when sedimentation in the Duwamish Valley closed off its southern end. The new lake, lacking any other outlets, drained south through the Black River into the Duwamish Valley and, ultimately, Puget Sound until the construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1916.

==Creeks and rivers==

The main inflowing rivers are the Sammamish and Cedar Rivers, with the Cedar supplying most of the water. Seasonal changes in the flow of the Sammamish are moderated by a weir at the Lake Sammamish inlet.

The lake is drained by the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

In addition, there are numerous small creeks and rivers which feed the lake, including:

* Coal Creek
* Denny Creek (O.O. Denny Park)
* Fairweather Creek
* Forbes Creek
* Juanita Creek
* Kelsey Creek
* Little Creek
* Lyon Creek
* Mapes Creek
* May Creek
* McAleer Creek
* Mercer Slough
* Ravenna Creek
* Taylor Creek
* Thornton Creek
* Yarrow Creek
* Yesler Creek
Historically, construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal drastically changed the inflow and outflow of the lake. Before construction of the canal in 1916, Lake Washington&#x27;s outlet was the Black River, which joined the Duwamish River and emptied into Elliott Bay. When the canal was opened the level of the lake dropped nearly nine feet (2.7 m). The canal became the lake&#x27;s sole outlet, causing the Black River to dry up and disappear. Before construction, the Sammamish River was the primary source of water for Lake Washington, and the lowering of the lake slightly increased its flow. As part of the ship canal project, the Cedar River was diverted into Lake Washington to become the lake&#x27;s primary source.

==Canals and bridges==

The Montlake Cut, part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, connects the lake to Lake Union and ultimately Puget Sound.

Concrete floating bridges are employed to span the lake because Lake Washington&#x27;s depth and muddy bottom prevented the emplacement of the pilings or towers necessary for the construction of a causeway or suspension bridge. The bridges consist of hollow concrete pontoons that float atop the lake, anchored with cables to each other and to weights on the lake bottom. The roadway is constructed atop these concrete pontoons. Three floating bridges cross Lake Washington: the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (officially the SR 520 Albert D. Rosellini Evergreen Point Floating Bridge) carries State Route 520 from Seattle&#x27;s Montlake neighborhood to Medina while the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Third Lake Washington Bridge (officially the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge) carry Interstate 90 from Seattle&#x27;s Mount Baker neighborhood to Mercer Island. The East Channel Bridge carries Interstate 90 from Mercer Island to Bellevue. The Evergreen Point, Lacey V. Murrow, and Third Lake Washington bridges are the longest, second longest, and fifth longest floating bridges in the world, respectively.

A portion of the Lacey V. Murrow Bridge sank during a windstorm on November 25, 1990; at the time, the bridge was closed for renovations. A Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) investigation revealed that the incident resulted from the improper handling of hydrodemolition water being used during the renovation, rather than in any basic flaw in the bridge&#x27;s concept or design. Concrete floating bridges continue to remain a viable means for the conveyance of vehicle traffic over Lake Washington.

In 1950, approximately one year after the tolls were removed from the Murrow bridge, the inland ferry system on the lake came to an end, having operated since the 1880s.

==Shoreline cities and towns==

The cities and towns bordering the lake, going clockwise from the west, are Seattle, Lake Forest Park, Kenmore, Kirkland, Yarrow Point, Hunts Point, Medina, Bellevue, Beaux Arts Village, and Renton. The city of Mercer Island occupies the island of the same name, in the southern half of the lake.
==Water purity==
Around 1900, Seattle began discharging sewage into Lake Washington. During the 1940s and 1950s, eleven sewage treatment plants were sending state-of-the-art treated water into the lake at a rate of 20 million gallons per day. At the same time, phosphate-based detergents came into wide use. The lake responded to the massive input of nutrients by developing unpleasant blooms of noxious blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). The water lost its clarity, the desirable fish populations declined, and masses of dead algae accumulated on the shores of the lake. After significant pollution, the October 5, 1963 issue of the &quot;Post Intelligencer&quot; referred to the lake as &quot;Lake Stinko&quot;. Citizen concern led to the creation of a system that diverted the treatment-plant effluents into nearby Puget Sound, where tidal flushing would mix them with open-ocean water.

The diversion was completed in 1968, and the lake responded quickly. The algal blooms diminished, the water regained its clarity, and by 1975, recovery was complete. Careful studies by a group of limnologists from the University of Washington showed that phosphate was the culprit. Since then, Lake Washington has undergone major improvements, drastically improving the ecology and water quality, making the water twice as clear as it was in 1950.

<text>Axel Johan Lille (28 March 1848, Helsinki – 28 June 1921) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish journalist and politician and the main founder of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Svenska folkpartiet&quot;, SFP) and its leader 1907–1917. Lille was the first who publicly proposed Finnish independence in his speech on April 9, 1902.

Lille was member of the Diet of Finland for the Estate of Burghers 1885–1900 and member of Parliament of Finland from 1916 to 1917. He founder newspaper &quot;Vikingen&quot;, refounded &quot;Nya Pressen&quot; and was its editor 1906–1914 and for its successor &quot;Dagens Press&quot;.

Lille was a Social conservative and wished to include more social reforms in SFP&#x27;s program than eventually was included.

In 1902, Lille moved to Stockholm, Sweden, and he received Swedish citizenship in 1903.

<text>In typography, emphasis is the strengthening of words in a text with a font in a different style from the rest of the text, to highlight them. It is the equivalent of prosody stress in speech.

== Methods and use ==
The most common methods in Western typography fall under the general technique of emphasis through a change or modification of font: &quot;italics&quot;, boldface and . Other methods include the alteration of LETTER CASE and spacing as well as color and *additional graphic marks*.

=== Font styles and variants ===
The human eye is very receptive to differences in &quot;brightness within a text body.&quot; Therefore, one can differentiate between types of emphasis according to whether the emphasis changes the &quot;blackness&quot; of text, sometimes referred to as typographic color.

A means of emphasis that does not have much effect on blackness is the use of &quot;italics&quot;, where the text is written in a script style, or &quot;oblique&quot;, where the vertical orientation of each letter of the text is slanted to the left or right. With one or the other of these techniques (usually only one is available for any typeface), words can be highlighted without making them stand out much from the rest of the text (inconspicuous stressing). This is used for marking passages that have a different context, such as book titles, words from foreign languages, or internal dialogue.
For multiple, nested levels of emphasis, the font is usually alternated back to (upright) roman script, or quotation marks are used instead, although some font families provide upright italics for a third visually distinct appearance.

By contrast, a bold font weight makes letters of a text thicker than the surrounding text. Bold strongly stands out from regular text, and is often used to highlight keywords important to the text&#x27;s content. For example, printed dictionaries often use boldface for their keywords, and the names of entries can conventionally be marked in bold.

Small capitals () are also used for emphasis, especially for the first line of a section, sometimes accompanied by or instead of a drop cap, or for personal names as in bibliographies.

If the text body is typeset in a serif typeface, it is also possible to highlight words by setting them in a sans serif face. This practice is often considered archaic in Latin script, and on computers is complicated since fonts are no longer issued by foundries with a standard baseline, so switching font may distort line spacing. It is still possible using some font super families, which come with matching serif and sans-serif variants, though these are not generally supplied with modern computers as system fonts. In Japanese typography, due to the reduced legibility of heavier Minchō type, the practice remains common.

Of these methods, italics, small capitals and capitalization are oldest, with bold type and sans-serif typefaces not arriving until the nineteenth century.

=== Capitalization ===
The house styles of many publishers in the United States use all caps text for:
* chapter and section headings;
* newspaper headlines;
* publication titles;
* warning messages; and
* words of important meaning.

Capitalization is used much less frequently by British publishers, and usually only for book titles.

All-uppercase letters are a common substitute form of emphasis where the medium lacks support for boldface, such as old typewriters, plain-text email, SMS and other text-messaging systems.

Socially, the use of all-caps text in Roman languages has become an indicator of shouting when quoting speech. It was also often used in the past by American lawyers to flag important points in a legal text. Coinciding with the era of typewriter use, the practice became unnecessary with the advent of computerized text formatting, although it is still found on occasion in documents created by older lawyers.

=== Letter-spacing ===

Another means of emphasis is to increase the spacing between the letters, rather than making them darker, but still achieving a distinction in blackness. This results in an effect reverse to boldface: the emphasized text becomes lighter than its environment. This is often used in blackletter typesetting and typewriter manuscripts, but by no means restricted to those situations.

This letter-spacing is referred to as &quot;sperren&quot; in German, which could be translated as &quot;spacing out&quot;: in typesetting with letters of lead, the spacing would be achieved by inserting additional non-printing slices of metal between the types, usually about an eighth of an em wide. On typewriters a full space was used between the letters of an emphasized word and also one before and one after the word.

For black letter type boldface was not feasible, since the letters were very dark in their standard format, and on (most) typewriters only a single type was available. Although letter-spacing was common, sometimes different typefaces (e.g. Schwabacher inside Fraktur), underlining or colored, usually red ink were used instead.

Since blackletter type remained in use in German speaking parts of Europe much longer than anywhere else, the custom of letter-spacing is sometimes seen as specific to German, although it has been used with other languages, including English. Especially in German, however, this kind of emphasis may also be used within modern type, e.g. where italics already serve another semantic purpose (as in linguistics) and where no further means of emphasis (e.g. small caps) are easily available or feasible. Its professional use today is very limited in German. This use of spacing is also traditionally found in Polish.

German orthographic (or rather typographic) rules require that the mandatory blackletter ligatures are retained. That means, &quot;ſt&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ck&quot;, and &quot;tz&quot; are still stuck together just as the letter &quot;ß&quot;, whereas optional, additional ligatures like &quot;ff&quot; and &quot;ſi&quot; are broken up with a (small) space in between. Other writing systems did not develop such sophisticated rules since spacing was so uncommon therein.

In Cyrillic typography, it also used to be common to emphasize words using letter-spaced type. This practice for Cyrillic has become obsolete with the availability of Cyrillic italic and small capital fonts.

=== Rotation ===
In Devanagari typography, letters may be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, which breaks up the shirorehka.

=== Shirorehka styling ===
In Devanagari typography, the shirorehka (horizontal line that connects letters into words) may be styled heavier, shaped into a wavy line, or doubled.

=== Underlining ===

Professional Western typesetting usually does not employ lines under letters for emphasis within running text. In proofreading, underlining (or underscoring) is a convention that says &quot;set this text in italic type&quot;, traditionally used on manuscript or typescript as an instruction to the printer. Its use to add emphasis in modern documents is a deprecated practice. In web pages, hyperlinks are often displayed with underlines to identify them as such rather than to emphasize them. Underlining is also used for secondary emphasis, i.e. marks added to a printed text by the reader.

=== Overlining ===
In Arabic, it is traditional to emphasize text by drawing a line over the letters. This is seen in the Quran, where the word at which Sujud Tilawa is performed is overlined.

=== Punctuation marks ===

Sometimes quotation marks are used for emphasis. However, this clashes with the general understanding of how the marks are properly used, particularly scare quotes, and can leave the reader with a different impression than intended.

In Chinese, emphasis in body text is supposed to be indicated by using an &quot;emphasis mark&quot; (着重號／着重号), which is a dot placed under each character to be emphasized. This is still taught in schools but in practice it is not usually done, probably due to the difficulty of doing this using most computer software. Consequently, methods used for emphasis in Western text are often used instead, even though they are considered inappropriate for Chinese (for example, the use of underlining or setting text in oblique type).

In Japanese texts, when katakana would be inappropriate, emphasis is indicated by &quot;emphasis dots&quot; (圏点 or 傍点) placed above the kanji and any accompanying furigana in horizontal writing and to the right in vertical writing. Japanese also has an &quot;emphasis line&quot; (傍線) used in a similar manner, but less frequently.

In Korean texts, a dot is placed above each Hangul syllable block or Hanja to be emphasized.

In Armenian the sign is used.

On websites and other Internet services, as with typewriters, rich text is not always available. Asterisks are sometimes used for emphasis (as in &quot;That was *really* bad&quot;). Less commonly, underscores may be used, resembling underlining (&quot;That was _really_ bad&quot;). Periods can be used between words (as in &quot;That. was. really. bad.&quot;) to emphasize whole sentences, mimicking when somebody slows down their speech for impact. In some cases, the engine behind the text area being parsed will render the text and the asterisks in bold automatically after the text is submitted. Markdown is a common formalization of this concept.

=== Color ===
Colors are important for emphasizing. Important words in a text may be colored differently from others. For example, many dictionaries use a different color for headwords, and some religious texts color the words of deities red, commonly referred to as rubric. In Ethiopic script, red is used analogously to italics in Latin text.

Post-print emphasis added by a reader is often done with highlighters which add a bright background color to usual black-on-white text.

Syntax highlighting also makes use of text color.

== Design ==

There are many designs. With both italics and boldface, the emphasis is correctly achieved by swapping into a different font of the same family; for example by replacing body text in Arial with its bold or italic style. Professional typographic systems, including most modern computers, would therefore not simply tilt letters to the right to achieve italics (that is instead referred to as &quot;slanting&quot; or &quot;oblique&quot;), print them twice or darker for boldface, or scale majuscules to the height of middle-chamber minuscules (like &quot;x&quot; and &quot;o&quot;) for small-caps, but instead use entirely different typefaces that achieve the effect. The letter &#x27;w&#x27;, for example, looks quite different in italic compared to upright.

As a result, typefaces therefore have to be supplied at least fourfold (with computer systems, usually as four font files): as regular, bold, italic, and bold italic to provide for all combinations. Professional typefaces sometimes offer even more variations for popular fonts, with varying degrees of blackness. Only if such fonts are not available should the effect of italic or boldface be imitated by algorithmically altering the original font.

The modern Latin-alphabet system of fonts appearing in two standard weights, with the styles being regular (or &quot;Roman&quot;), italic, bold and bold italic is a relatively recent development, dating to the early twentieth century. Modern &quot;Roman&quot; type was developed around the 1470s, while italic type was developed around 1500 and was commonly used for emphasis by the early 17th century. Bold type did not arrive until the nineteenth century, and at first fonts did not have matching bold weights; instead a generic bold, sometimes a Clarendon or other kind of slab-serif, would be swapped in. In some books printed before bold type existed, emphasis could be shown by switching to blackletter. Some font families intended for professional use in documents such as business reports may also make the bold-style numbers take up the same width as the regular (non-bold) numbers, so a bold-style total lines up below the digits of the sum in regular style.

== Recommendations and requirements ==
Linguistics professor Larry Trask stated that &quot;It is possible to write an entire word or phrase in capital letters in order to emphasize it&quot;, but adds that &quot;On the whole, though, it is preferable to express emphasis, not with capital letters, but with italics.&quot; Many university researchers and academic journal editors advise not to use italics, or other approaches to emphasizing a word, unless essential, for example the Modern Language Association &quot;discourages the use of italics in academic prose to emphasize or point, because they are unnecessary—most often, the unadorned words do the job without typographic assistance&quot;. Although emphasis is useful in speech, and so has a place in informal or journalistic writing, in academic traditions it is often suggested that italics are only used where there is a danger of misunderstanding the meaning of the sentence, and even in that case that rewriting the sentence is preferable; in formal writing the reader is expected to interpret and understand the text themselves, without the assumption that the precise intended interpretation of the author is correct. Italics are principally used in academic writing for texts that have been referenced, and for foreign language words. Similarly capitals and underlining have particular meanings, and are rarely used in formal writing for emphasis.

<doc id="219807" wikidata="Q582062" url="?curid=219807" title="Keel">
<text>The keel is the bottom-most longitudinal structural element of a watercraft. On some sailboats, it may have a hydrodynamic and counterbalancing purpose as well. The laying of the keel is often the initial step in constructing a ship. In the British and American shipbuilding traditions, this event marks the beginning date of a ship&#x27;s construction.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;keel&quot; comes from Old English , Old Norse , = &quot;ship&quot; or &quot;keel&quot;. It has the distinction of being regarded by some scholars as the first word in the English language recorded in writing, having been recorded by Gildas in his 6th century Latin work &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, under the spelling &quot;cyulae&quot; (he was referring to the three ships that the Saxons first arrived in).

 is the Latin word for &quot;keel&quot; and is the origin of the term careen (to clean a keel and the hull in general, often by rolling the ship on its side). An example of this use is Careening Cove, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, where careening was carried out in the early colonial days.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The use of a keel in sailing vessels dates back to antiquity.
The wreck of an ancient Greek merchant ship known as the Kyrenia ship establishes the origin of the keel at least as far back as 315 BC.
The Uluburun shipwreck ( 1325 BC) had a rudimentary keel, but it may have been more of a center plank than a keel.

=== Construction styles ===
==== Frame first ====
In carvel-built hulls, construction began with the laying of the keel, followed by the stern and stem. Frames were set up afterward, set at key points along the keel. Later, the keelson was attached to the keel, either bolted or with treenails.

==== Plank first ====

A plank first building system that is still in use today is clinker construction, using overlapping planks which are shaped to produce the hull form. Older systems include the bottom-based method used for the planking on either side of the keel of a cog (and also in Dutch shipbuilding up to and including the 17th century). This involves flush-fitted planks that have been cut to provide the shape of the hull. Still older is the mortice and tenon edge-to-edge joining of hull planks in the Mediterranean during the classical period. In this system, much of the strength of the hull is derived from the planking, with the frames providing some extra strength. In all these systems, the joining of the keel, stem and sternpost are the starting point of construction.

==Structural keels==
A structural keel is the bottom-most structural member around which the hull of a ship is built. The keel runs along the centerline of the ship, from the bow to the stern. The keel is often the first part of a ship&#x27;s hull to be constructed, and laying the keel, or placing the keel in the cradle where the ship will be built, may mark the start time of its construction. Large, modern ships are now often built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel, so the shipbuilding process commences with the cutting of the first sheet of steel.

The most common type of keel is the &quot;flat plate keel&quot;, which is fitted in most ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the &quot;bar keel&quot;, which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.

==Hydrodynamic keels==
Hydrodynamic keels have the primary purpose of interacting with the water and are typical of certain sailboats. Fixed hydrodynamic keels have the structural strength to support the boat&#x27;s weight.

===Sailboat keels===
In sailboats, keels serve two purposes: 1) as an underwater foil to minimize the lateral motion of the vessel under sail (leeway) and 2) as a counterweight to the lateral force of the wind on the sail(s) that causes rolling to the side (heeling). As an underwater foil, a keel uses the forward motion of the boat to generate lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind. As a counterweight, a keel increasingly offsets the heeling moment with increasing angle of heel. Related foils include movable centreplates, which -being metal- have the secondary purpose of being a counterweight, and centreboards and daggerboards, which are of lighter weight, do not have the secondary purpose of being a counterweight.

Moveable sailboat keels may pivot (a centreboard, centreplate or swing keel), retract upwards (lifting/retracting keel or daggerboard), or swing sideways in the water (canting keels) to move the ballasting effect to one side and allow the boat to sail in a more upright position.

<doc id="219810" wikidata="Q19827042" url="?curid=219810" title="Bow and arrow">
<text>The bow and arrow is a ranged weapon system consisting of an elastic launching device (bow) and long-shafted projectiles (arrows). Humans used bows and arrows for hunting and aggression long before recorded history, and the practice was common to many prehistoric cultures. They were important weapons of war from ancient history until the early modern period, when they were rendered increasingly obsolete by the development of the more powerful and accurate firearms. Today, bows and arrows are mostly used for hunting and sports.

Archery is the art, practice, or skill of using bows to shoot arrows. A person who shoots arrows with a bow is called a bowman or an archer. Someone who makes bows is known as a bowyer, someone who makes arrows is a fletcher, and someone who manufactures metal arrowheads is an arrowsmith.

==Basic design and use==
A bow consists of a semi-rigid but elastic arc with a high-tensile bowstring joining the ends of the two limbs of the bow. An arrow is a projectile with a pointed tip and a long shaft with stabilizer fins (fletching) towards the back, with a narrow notch (&quot;nock&quot;) at the very end to contact the bowstring.

To load an arrow for shooting (&quot;nocking&quot; an arrow), the archer places an arrow across the middle of the bow with the bowstring in the arrow&#x27;s nock. To shoot, the archer holds the bow at its center with one hand and pulls back (draws) the arrow and the bowstring with the other (typically the dominant hand). This flexes the two limbs of the bow rearwards, which perform the function of a pair of cantilever springs to store elastic energy.

While maintaining the draw, the archer typically aims the shot intuitively or by sighting along the arrow. Then the archer releases (looses) the draw, allowing the limbs&#x27; stored energy to convert into kinetic energy transmitted via the bowstring to the arrow, propelling it to fly forward with high velocity.

A container or bag for additional arrows for quick reloading is called a &quot;quiver&quot;.

When not in use, bows are generally kept &quot;unstrung&quot;, meaning one or both ends of the bowstring are detached from the bow. This removes all residual tension on the bow and can help prevent it from losing strength or elasticity over time. Many bow designs also let it straighten out more completely, reducing the space needed to store the bow. Returning the bowstring to its ready-to-use position is called &quot;stringing&quot; the bow.

==History==

The oldest known evidence of the bow and arrow comes from South African sites such as Sibudu Cave, where likely arrowheads have been found, dating from approximately 72,000–60,000 years ago.

The earliest probable arrowheads found outside of Africa were discovered in 2020 in Fa Hien Cave, Sri Lanka. They have been dated to 48,000 years ago. &quot;Bow-and-arrow hunting at the Sri Lankan site likely focused on monkeys and smaller animals, such as squirrels, Langley says. Remains of these creatures were found in the same sediment as the bone points.&quot;

Small stone points from the Grotte Mandrin in Southern France, used some 54,000 years ago, have damage from use that indicates their use as projectile weapons, and some are too small (less than 10mm across as the base) for any practical use other than as arrowheads. They are associated with possibly the first groups of modern humans to leave Africa.

After the end of the last glacial period, some 12,000 years ago, the use of the bow seems to have spread to every inhabited region except for Australasia and most of Oceania. The reason for the absence of locally-made bow and arrow technology from the Australian continent, when it was widely and commonly used elsewhere, has long been debated. It has recently been hypothesised that it is because the mechanical and physical properties of common Australian woods make them unsuitable for selfbows. 

The earliest definite remains of bow and arrow from Europe are possible fragments from Germany found at Mannheim-Vogelstang dated 17,500–18,000 years ago, and at Stellmoor dated 11,000 years ago. Azilian points found in Grotte du Bichon, Switzerland, alongside the remains of both a bear and a hunter, with flint fragments found in the bear&#x27;s third vertebra, suggest the use of arrows at 13,500 years ago.

At the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons about 10,000 years ago.

The oldest extant bows in one piece are the elm Holmegaard bows from Denmark, which were dated to 9,000 BCE. Several bows from Holmegaard, Denmark, date 8,000 years ago. High-performance wooden bows are currently made following the Holmegaard design. The Stellmoor bow fragments from northern Germany were dated to about 8,000 BCE, but they were destroyed in Hamburg during the Second World War, before carbon 14 dating was available; their age is attributed by archaeological association.
The bow was an important weapon for both hunting and warfare from prehistoric times until the widespread use of gunpowder weapons in the 16th century. It was also common in ancient warfare, although certain cultures would not favor them. Greek poet Archilocus expressed scorn for fighting with bows and slings.

The skill of Nubian archers was renowned in ancient Egypt and beyond. Their mastery of the bow gained their land the name &quot;Ta-Seti&quot;, &quot;Land of the Bow&quot; in Ancient Egyptian.

Beginning with the reign of William the Conqueror, the longbow was England&#x27;s principal weapon of war until the end of the Middle Ages. Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes conquered much of the Eurasian steppe using short bows. Native Americans used archery to hunt and defend themselves during the days of English and later American colonization.

Organised warfare with bows ended in the early to mid-17th century in Western Europe, but it persisted into the 19th century in Eastern cultures, including hunting and warfare in the New World. In the Canadian Arctic, bows were made until the end of the 20th century for hunting caribou, for instance at Igloolik. The bow has more recently been used as a weapon of tribal warfare in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa; an example was documented in 2009 in Kenya when Kisii people and Kalenjin people clashed, resulting in four deaths.

The British upper class led a revival of archery as a sport in the late 18th century. Sir Ashton Lever, an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, under the patronage of George IV, then Prince of Wales.

Bows and arrows have been rarely used by modern special forces for survival and clandestine operations.

==Construction==

===Parts of the bow===
The basic elements of a modern bow are a pair of curved elastic limbs, traditionally made from wood, joined by a riser. However self bows such as the English longbow are made of a single piece of wood comprising both limbs and the grip. The ends of each limb are connected by a string known as the bow string. By pulling the string backwards the archer exerts compression force on the string-facing section, or belly, of the limbs as well as placing the outer section, or back, under tension. While the string is held, this stores the energy later released in putting the arrow to flight. The force required to hold the string stationary at full draw is often used to express the power of a bow, and is known as its draw weight, or weight. Other things being equal, a higher draw weight means a more powerful bow, which is able to project heavier arrows at the same velocity or the same arrow at a greater velocity.

The various parts of the bow can be subdivided into further sections. The topmost limb is known as the upper limb, while the bottom limb is the lower limb. At the tip of each limb is a nock, which is used to attach the bowstring to the limbs. The riser is usually divided into the grip, which is held by the archer, as well as the arrow rest and the bow window. The arrow rest is a small ledge or extension above the grip which the arrow rests upon while being aimed. The bow window is that part of the riser above the grip, which contains the arrow rest.

In bows drawn and held by hand, the maximum draw weight is determined by the strength of the archer. The maximum distance the string could be displaced and thus the longest arrow that could be loosed from it, a bow&#x27;s draw length, is determined by the size of the archer.

A composite bow uses a combination of materials to create the limbs, allowing the use of materials specialized for the different functions of a bow limb. The classic composite bow uses wood for lightness and dimensional stability in the core, horn to store compression energy, and sinew for its ability to store energy in tension. Such bows, typically Asian, would often use a stiff end on the limb end, having the effect of a recurve. In this type of bow, this is known by the Arabic name &#x27;siyah&#x27;.

Modern construction materials for bows include laminated wood, fiberglass, metals, and carbon fiber components.

===Arrows===

An arrow usually consists of a shaft with an arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Modern arrows are usually made from carbon fibre, aluminum, fiberglass, and wood shafts. Carbon shafts have the advantage that they do not bend or warp, but they can often be too light weight to shoot from some bows and are expensive. Aluminum shafts are less expensive than carbon shafts, but they can bend and warp from use. Wood shafts are the least expensive option but often will not be identical in weight and size to each other and break more often than the other types of shafts. Arrow sizes vary greatly across cultures and range from very short ones that require the use of special equipment to be shot to ones in use in the Amazon River jungles that are long. Most modern arrows are in length.

Arrows come in many types, among which are breasted, bob-tailed, barreled, clout, and target. A breasted arrow is thickest at the area right behind the fletchings, and tapers towards the (nock) and head. A bob-tailed arrow is thickest right behind the head, and tapers to the nock. A barrelled arrow is thickest in the centre of the arrow. Target arrows are those arrows used for target shooting rather than warfare or hunting, and usually have simple arrowheads.

For safety reasons, a bow should never be shot without an arrow nocked; without an arrow, the energy that is normally transferred into the projectile is instead directed back into the bow itself, which will cause damage to the bow&#x27;s limbs.

===Arrowheads===
The end of the arrow that is designed to hit the target is called the arrowhead. Usually, these are separate items that are attached to the arrow shaft by either tangs or sockets. Materials used in the past for arrowheads include flint, bone, horn, or metal. Most modern arrowheads are made of steel, but wood and other traditional materials are still used occasionally. A number of different types of arrowheads are known, with the most common being bodkins, broadheads, and piles. Bodkin heads are simple spikes made of metal of various shapes, designed to pierce armour. A broadhead arrowhead is usually triangular or leaf-shaped and has a sharpened edge or edges. Broadheads are commonly used for hunting. A pile arrowhead is a simple metal cone, either sharpened to a point or somewhat blunt, that is used mainly for target shooting. A pile head is the same diameter as the arrow shaft and is usually just fitted over the tip of the arrow. Other heads are known, including the blunt head, which is flat at the end and is used for hunting small game or birds, and is designed to not pierce the target nor embed itself in trees or other objects and make recovery difficult. Another type of arrowhead is a barbed head, usually used in warfare or hunting.

===Bowstrings===
Bowstrings may have a nocking point marked on them, which serves to mark where the arrow is fitted to the bowstring before shooting. The area around the nocking point is usually bound with thread to protect the area around the nocking point from wear by the archer&#x27;s hands. This section is called the serving. At one end of the bowstring a loop is formed, which is permanent. The other end of the bowstring also has a loop, but this is not permanently formed into the bowstring but is constructed by tying a knot into the string to form a loop. Traditionally this knot is known as the archer&#x27;s knot, but is a form of the timber hitch. The knot can be adjusted to lengthen or shorten the bowstring. The adjustable loop is known as the &quot;tail&quot;. The string is often twisted (this being called the &quot;flemish twist&quot;).

Bowstrings have been constructed of many materials throughout history, including fibres such as flax, silk, and hemp. Other materials used were animal guts, animal sinews, and rawhide. Modern fibres such as Dacron or Kevlar are now used in commercial bowstring construction, as well as steel wires in some compound bows. Compound bows have a mechanical system of pulley cams over which the bowstring is wound. Nylon is useful only in emergency situations, as it stretches too much.

==Types of bow==
There is no single accepted system of classification of bows. Bows may be described by various characteristics including the materials used, the length of the draw that they permit, the shape of the bow in sideways view, and the shape of the limb in cross-section.

Commonly-used descriptors for bows include:

===By side profile===
* Straight bow: a bow approximately straight in side-view profile. These bows are referred to as straight, although there may be minor curves in the natural wood, and the bow may have a &quot;set&quot; or curvature that a wooden bow takes after use. 
* Recurve bow: a bow with the tips curving away from the archer. The curves straighten out as the bow is drawn and the return of the tip to its curved state after release of the arrow adds extra velocity to the arrow.
* Reflex bow: a bow whose entire limbs curve away from the archer when unstrung. The curves are opposite to the direction in which the bow flexes while drawn.

===By material===
* Self bow: a bow made from one piece of wood.
* Composite bow: a bow made of more than one material.

===By cross-section of limb===
* Longbow: a self bow with limbs rounded in cross-section, about the same height as the archer so as to allow a full draw, usually over long. The traditional English longbow was made of yew wood, but other woods are also used.
* Flatbow: the limbs are approximately rectangular in cross-section. This was traditional in many Native American societies and was found to be the most efficient shape for bow limbs by American engineers in the 20th century 

===Other characteristics===
* Takedown bow: a bow that can be disassembled for transportation, usually consisting of three parts: two limbs and a riser, in addition to the string.
* Compound bow: a bow with mechanical amplifiers to aid with drawing the bowstring. Usually, these amplifiers are asymmetric pulleys called &quot;cams&quot; (though they are not actually cams) at the ends of the limbs, which provide a mechanical advantage (known as the &quot;let-off&quot;) while holding the bow in full draw. Such bows typically have high draw weights and are usually drawn with a release aid with a trigger mechanism for a consistently clean release.
* Crossbow: a bow mounted horizontally on a frame similar to a firearm stock, which has a locking mechanism for holding the bowstring at full draw. Crossbows typically shoot arrow-like darts called bolts or &quot;quarrels&quot;, rather than normal arrows.
* Footbow: a bow meant to be used with the legs and arms while lying down and used in the current distance record for the furthest arrow shot.

<doc id="219826" wikidata="Q25519942" url="?curid=219826" title="Bacillota">
<text>Bacillota (synonym Firmicutes) is a phylum of bacteria, most of which have gram-positive cell wall structure. The renaming of phyla such as Firmicutes in 2021 remains controversial among microbiologists, many of whom continue to use the earlier names of long standing in the literature.

The name &quot;Firmicutes&quot; was derived from the Latin words for &quot;tough skin,&quot; referring to the thick cell wall typical of bacteria in this phylum. Scientists once classified the Firmicutes to include all gram-positive bacteria, but have recently defined them to be of a core group of related forms called the low-G+C group, in contrast to the Actinomycetota. They have round cells, called cocci (singular coccus), or rod-like forms (bacillus). A few Firmicutes, such as &quot;Megasphaera&quot;, &quot;Pectinatus&quot;, &quot;Selenomonas&quot; and &quot;Zymophilus&quot;, have a porous pseudo-outer membrane that causes them to stain gram-negative.

Many Bacillota (Firmicutes) produce endospores, which are resistant to desiccation and can survive extreme conditions. They are found in various environments, and the group includes some notable pathogens. Those in one family, the heliobacteria, produce energy through anoxygenic photosynthesis. Bacillota play an important role in beer, wine, and cider spoilage.

== Classes ==
The group is typically divided into the Clostridia, which are anaerobic, and the Bacilli, which are obligate or optional aerobes.

On phylogenetic trees, the first two groups show up as paraphyletic or polyphyletic, as do their main genera, &quot;Clostridium&quot; and &quot;Bacillus&quot;. However, Bacillota as a whole is generally believed to be monophyletic, or paraphyletic with the exclusion of Mollicutes.

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

The Firmicutes are thought by some to be the source of the archaea, by models there the archaea branched relatively late from bacteria, rather than forming an independently originating early lineage (domain of life) from the last universal common ancestor of cellular life (LUCA).

==Genera==
More than 274 genera were considered to be within the Bacillota phylum, notable genera of Bacillota include:

Bacilli, order Bacillales
* &quot;Bacillus&quot;
* &quot;Listeria&quot;
* &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;
Bacilli, order Lactobacillales
* &quot;Enterococcus&quot;
* &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;
* &quot;Leuconostoc&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus&quot;
Clostridia
* &quot;Clostridioides&quot;
* &quot;Clostridium&quot;
* &quot;Selenomonas&quot;
Erysipelotrichia
* &quot;Erysipelothrix&quot;

== Clinical significance ==
Bacillota make up ~30% of the mouse and human gut microbiome. The phylum Bacillota as part of the gut microbiota has been shown to be involved in energy resorption, and potentially related to the development of diabetes and obesity. Within the gut of healthy human adults, the most abundant bacterium: &quot;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii)&quot;, which makes up 5% of the total gut microbiome, is a member of the Bacillota phylum. This species is directly associated with reduced low-grade inflammation in obesity. &quot;F. prausnitzii&quot; has been found in higher levels within the guts of obese children than in non-obese children.

In multiple studies a higher abundance of Bacillota has been found in obese individuals than in lean controls. A higher level of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; (of the Bacillota phylum) has been found in obese patients and in one study, obese patients put on weight loss diets showed a reduced amount of Bacillota within their guts.

Diet changes in mice have also been shown to promote changes in Bacillota abundance. A higher relative abundance of Bacillota was seen in mice fed a western diet (high fat/high sugar) than in mice fed a standard low fat/ high polysaccharide diet. The higher amount of Bacillota was also linked to more adiposity and body weight within mice. Specifically, within obese mice, the class &quot;Mollicutes&quot; (within the Bacillota phylum) was the most common. When the microbiota of obese mice with this higher Bacillota abundance was transplanted into the guts of germ-free mice, the germ-free mice gained a significant amount of fat as compared to those transplanted with the microbiota of lean mice with lower Bacillota abundance.

The presence of &quot;Christensenella&quot; (Bacillota, in class Clostridia), isolated from human faeces, has been found to correlate with lower body mass index.

<text>Estienne du Tertre (fl. mid-16th century) was a French composer. He spent most of his life in Paris and worked as an editor for the publisher Attaingnant, notably succeeding Claude Gervaise as the editor of Attaignant&#x27;s collections of &quot;Danseries:&quot; he was responsible for seventh volume of this series which appeared in 1557. He is the first editor to use the term &quot;suytte&quot; (suite) for collections of Bransles. In addition to his work with Attaignant, he is the author of fifty-seven complete and fourteen fragmentary published chansons which appeared between 1543 and 1568 largely in collections published by Attaignant and Nicolas du Chemin. There are also twenty five of his songs that use the same texts as songs by Clément Janequin.

<doc id="219831" wikidata="Q132209" url="?curid=219831" title="Neisseria">
<text>Neisseria is a large genus of bacteria that colonize the mucosal surfaces of many animals. Of the 11 species that colonize humans, only two are pathogens, &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;.

&quot;Neisseria&quot; species are Gram-negative bacteria included among the Pseudomonadota, a large group of Gram-negative forms. &quot;Neisseria&quot; diplococci resemble coffee beans when viewed microscopically.

==Pathogenesis and classification==
===Pathogens===
Species of this genus (family Neisseriaceae) of parasitic bacteria grow in pairs and occasionally fours, and thrive best at 98.6 °F (37 °C) in the animal body or serum media.

The genus includes:
* &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; (also called the gonococcus) causes gonorrhea.
* &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; (also called the meningococcus) is one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis and the causative agent of meningococcal septicaemia.

The immune system&#x27;s neutrophils are restricted in function due to the ability of &quot;Neisseria&quot; to evade opsonization by antibodies, and to replicate within neutrophils despite phagocytosis. &quot;Neisseria&quot; species are also able to alter their antigens to avoid being engulfed by a process called antigenic variation, which is observed primarily in surface-located molecules. The pathogenic species along with some commensal species, have type IV pili which serve multiple functions for this organism. Some functions of the type IV pili include: mediating attachment to various cells and tissues, twitching motility, natural competence, microcolony formation, extensive intrastrain phase, and antigenic variation.

&quot;Neisseria&quot; bacteria have also been shown to be an important factor in the early stages of canine plaque development.

=== Nonpathogens ===
This genus also contains several, believed to be commensal, or nonpathogenic, species:
*&quot;Neisseria bacilliformis&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria cinerea&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria elongata&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria flavescens&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria lactamica&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria macacae&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria mucosa&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria oralis&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria polysaccharea&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria sicca&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria subflava&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria flava&quot;

However, some of these can be associated with disease.

==Biochemical identification==
All the medically significant species of &quot;Neisseria&quot; are positive for both catalase and oxidase. Different &quot;Neisseria&quot; species can be identified by the sets of sugars from which they will produce acid. For example, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; makes acid from only glucose, but &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; produces acid from both glucose and maltose.

Polysaccharide capsule. &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; has a polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the outer membrane of the bacterium and protects against soluble immune effector mechanisms within the serum. It is considered to be an essential virulence factor for the bacteria. &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; possesses no such capsule.

Unlike most other Gram-negative bacteria, which possess lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both pathogenic and commensal species of &quot;Neisseria&quot; have a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) which consists of a core polysaccharide and lipid A. It functions as an endotoxin, protects against antimicrobial peptides, and adheres to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on urethral epithelium. LOS is highly stimulatory to the human immune system. LOS sialylation (by the enzyme Lst) prevents phagocytosis by neutrophils and complement deposition. LOS modification by phosphoethanolamine (by the enzyme LptA) provides resistance to antimicrobial peptides and complement. Strains of the same species have the ability to produce different LOS glycoforms.

==History==
The genus &quot;Neisseria&quot; is named after the German bacteriologist Albert Neisser, who in 1879 discovered its first example, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, the pathogen which causes the human disease gonorrhea. Neisser also co-discovered the pathogen that causes leprosy, &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;. These discoveries were made possible by the development of new staining techniques which he helped to develop.

== Genomes ==
The genomes of at least 10 &quot;Neisseria&quot; species have been completely sequenced. The best-studied species are &quot;N.&quot; &quot;meningitidis&quot; with more than 70 strains and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; with at least 10 strains completely sequenced. Other complete genomes are available for &quot;N. elongata, N. lactamica,&quot; and &quot;N. weaveri.&quot; Whole genome shotgun sequences are available for hundreds of other species and strains. &quot;N.&quot; &quot;meningitidis&quot; encodes 2,440 to 2,854 proteins while &quot;&quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;&quot; encodes from 2,603 to 2,871 proteins. &quot;N. weaveri&quot; (strain NCTC 13585) has the smallest known genome with only 2,060 encoded proteins although &quot;N. meningitidis MC58&quot; has been reported to have only 2049 genes. The genomes are generally quite similar. For example, when the genome of &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; (strain FA1090) is compared to that of &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; (strain H44/76) 68% of their genes are shared.
==Vaccine==
Diseases caused by &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; are significant health problems worldwide, the control of which is largely dependent on the availability and widespread use of comprehensive meningococcal vaccines. Development of neisserial vaccines has been challenging due to the nature of these organisms, in particular the heterogeneity, variability and/or poor immunogenicity of their outer surface components. As strictly human pathogens, they are highly adapted to the host environment, but have evolved several mechanisms to remain adaptable to changing microenvironments and avoid elimination by the host immune system. Currently, serogroup A, B, C, Y, and W-135 meningococcal infections can be prevented by vaccines. However, the prospect of developing a gonococcal vaccine is remote.

==Antibiotic resistance==
The acquisition of cephalosporin resistance in &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, particularly ceftriaxone resistance, has greatly complicated the treatment of gonorrhea, with the gonococcus now being classified as a &quot;superbug&quot;.

==Genetic transformation==
Genetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient’s genome by recombination. In &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9-10 monomers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA. These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs). Specific recognition of DUSs is mediated by a type IV pilin. Davidsen et al. reported that in &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; and &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot;, DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. These authors proposed that the over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell. Caugant and Maiden noted that the distribution of DUS is consistent with recombination being primarily a mechanism for genome repair that can occasionally result in generation of diversity, which even more occasionally, is adaptive. It was also suggested by Michod et al. that an important benefit of transformation in &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; is recombinational repair of oxidative DNA damages caused by oxidative attack by the host’s phagocytic cells.

==International Pathogenic &quot;Neisseria&quot; Conference==
The International Pathogenic &quot;Neisseria&quot; Conference (IPNC), occurring every two years, is a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research on all aspects of the genus &quot;Neisseria&quot;. This includes immunology, vaccinology, and physiology and metabolism of &quot;N. meningitidis&quot;, &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; and the commensal species. The first IPNC took place in 1978, and the most recent one was in September 2016. Normally, the location of the conference switches between North America and Europe, but it took place in Australia for the first time in 2006, where the venue was located in Cairns.

<text>Leonidas &quot;Leon&quot; Pyrgos (, born 1874 in Mantineia, Arcadia; date of death unknown) was a Greek fencer.

==Career==
Pyrgos was the first Greek Olympic medallist in the history of the modern Olympic Games, winning his fencing event of the 1896 Summer Olympics on 7 April 1896. His competitor in the event, which consisted of a single bout of foil fencing to three touches, was one of the best fencers in the world, the Frenchman Joanni Perronet. After a close contest, Pyrgos won 3–1. The crowd cheered the first Greek Olympic medallist. He was lifted onto their shoulders and carried throughout the streets of Athens.

<doc id="219842" wikidata="Q7118949" url="?curid=219842" title="Ackerley Prize">
<text>The TLS Ackerley Prize is awarded annually to a literary autobiography of excellence, written by an author of British nationality and published during the preceding year. The winner receives £4,000. 

The prize was established by Nancy West, née Ackerley, sister of English author and editor J. R. Ackerley. It was first awarded in 1982. 

The prize is judged by the trustees of the J. R. Ackerley Trust; biographer and historian Peter Parker (Chair), the biographer and critic Claire Harman, and the writer and editor Michael Caines. There is no formal submission process for the award — judges simply &quot;call in&quot; books to be added to their longlist.

Former judges include the novelist Francis King, the biographer Michael Holroyd, the editor of Ackerley’s letters, Neville Braybrooke, food writer and historian Colin Spencer, the biographer and historian Richard Davenport-Hines and the novelist and short story writer Georgina Hammick. 

In 2023, the Prize’s long partnership with English PEN, when it was known as the PEN Ackerley Prize, came to an end. The award reverted to its original name of the Ackerley Prize.

In 2024, the Prize formed a partnership with the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; and was renamed the TLS Ackerley Prize.

<doc id="219845" wikidata="Q1151330" url="?curid=219845" title="Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral">
<text>Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral or in full Mary, Queen of the World and St. James the Great Cathedral is a minor basilica in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal. It is the third largest church in Quebec after Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory (also in Montreal) and the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré east of Quebec City. The building is 101 m (333 ft) in length, 46 m (150 ft) in width, and a maximum height of 77 m (252 ft) at the cupola, the diameter of which is 23 m (75 ft).

The church is located at 1085 Cathedral Street at the corner of René Lévesque Boulevard and Metcalfe Street, near the Bonaventure metro station and Central Station in downtown Montreal. It and the connected Archdiocese main buildings form the eastern side of Place du Canada, and occupies a dominant presence on Dorchester Square.

==History==

The construction of the cathedral was ordered by Mgr. Ignace Bourget, second bishop of Montreal, to replace the former Saint-Jacques Cathedral which had burned in 1852. His choice to create a scale model of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome was in response to a rivalry with the Sulpician order who had been the feudal seigneurs of Montreal, and with the Anglican Church, both of which favoured the Neo-Gothic style instead. The site also sparked controversy due to its location in the western part of downtown, in a then predominantly English neighbourhood far from the homes of the French-Canadian church-goers.

The first architect, Victor Bourgeau, refused the project after studying St. Peter&#x27;s, saying that it could not be reproduced on a smaller scale. At the time, the Holy See and the Papal States were threatened by the nationalist troops of Victor Emmanuel II, king of Piedmont, who was attempting to assert control over all Italy. The undeterred bishop Bourget reacted to these events by sending a total of 507 Canadian Zouaves to defend the Papal territories in Italy, whose names are engraved in gold letters on the marble slabs in the cathedral. Their motto is: &quot;Love God and go your way.&quot; A painting depicting Colonel Athanase de Charette, commander of the Papal Zouaves, was made in 1885 by Lionel Royer. Fr. Joseph Michaud, the chaplain of the Papal Zouave volunteers of Montreal, was sent to Rome to secretly produce a scale model to work from.

Work began in 1875 and the new church was consecrated in 1894 as Saint James Cathedral, after Saint James the Great, the patron of the parish the church served. At the time it was the largest church in Quebec. It was made a minor basilica in 1919 by Pope Benedict XV. It was rededicated in 1955 to Mary, Queen of the World, by Pope Pius XII at the request of cardinal Paul-Émile Léger. (The pope had proclaimed this title for Mary in his 1954 encyclical &quot;Ad caeli reginam&quot;.)

Between 1955 and 1960, several restoration works were executed. On March 28, 2000, the cathedral was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

, the cathedral&#x27;s esplanade and narthex have undergone significant reconstruction. The exterior statue of Bishop Ignace Bourget was cleaned and restored in 2005.

==Design==
===Chapels===
==== Baptistery ====
A small chapel is dedicated to baptism ceremonies. The marble baptismal font is mounted on a stucco crucifix sculpted by Louis-Philippe Hébert.

==== Bishops&#x27; mortuary chapel ====

The burial chapel, completed in 1933, is located on the east wall of the building, east of the nave, halfway between the main entrance and the altar in the centre. The tomb of Mgr. Bourget, an art work which was created in Rome, is located in the centre. The remains of the bishop that lay in a crypt under one of the pillars in the cathedral were transferred to his tomb on April 27, 1933. The titular bishops are buried on the west side and the auxiliary bishops on the east-hand side.

The walls and floors are made of marble imported from Italy and feature several mosaics. The bronze plaque above the altar depicts St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

Since the cathedral was running out of space for burying auxiliary bishops, a second chapel was built next to the original one in 2005. Here an additional 15 vaults have been prepared.

==== Chapel of the Assumption ====
This chapel, also known as the Marriage Chapel, is located on the west side of the nave (across from the Bishop&#x27;s Chapel). This work of art features a wood-carved altarpiece, decorated with gold leaf and framing a painting depicting the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. It was made around 1635 at the Benedictine Abbey in Bellelay, Switzerland by a Spanish monk. When the monks were forced to leave during the religious retaliation, the occupying French troops sold all the precious furniture in the Abbey. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Austrian architect-conservator Rodolphe Messmer discovered the altarpiece in the church of Suarce, France and acquired it. In 1994, Bruno Messmer donated it to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal.

In 1957, Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger put the chapel at the disposal of the Order of Malta. The stained-glass windows are dedicated to this Order.

=== Ciborium ===

Covering the altar, which is located under the dome, is a neo-baroque ciborium or baldaquin, with twisting columns. It was created in Rome in 1900 by Joseph-Arthur Vincent and is a reproduction of the famous &#x27;baldacchino&#x27; in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, created by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

It is fully hand-made and made with red copper and gold leaf. The angels, garlands and papal insignia were sculpted between 1910 and 1911 by Olindo Gratton. This work of art was a donation to the cathedral by the Sulpicians.

=== Great Organ ===
Built by &quot;Casavant Frères&quot;, the organ was inaugurated on September 22, 1893. At that time, it consisted of 56 stops on three manuals and a pedal board. In 1951 the organ required maintenance, after which it was decided to rebuild the entire organ. Again, &quot;Casavant Frères&quot; was chosen for the job, and they added 20 stops and a manual.

In 1995–1996, the instrument was restored by &quot;Guilbault-Thérien&quot; from Saint-Hyacinthe. A few more additions were made, so that now the organ counts a total of 93 stops, four manuals and one pedal board.

=== Paintings ===

The aisles of the nave and the arches in the transept contain painting depicting historical events in the early days of Montreal (called Ville-Marie at the time). It contains nine paintings and still three empty spaces. The paintings are:
# The aforementioned painting of colonel Athanase de Charette, commander of the Papal Zouaves of Montreal. Work by Lionel Ryder.
# Marguerite d&#x27;Youville singing &quot;Te Deum&quot; to children during the fire that destroyed her hospital on May 18, 1765. Work by Georges Delfosse.
# Marguerite Bourgeoys teaching her Amerindian pupils in 1694 at the foot of one of the historic towers on ground belonging to the Sulpicians. Work by Georges Delfosse.
# The martyrdom of Jean de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalemant in the land of the Hurons. The Iroquois tortured the Jesuit missionaries, of whom de Brébeuf can be seen in the centre with his hands tied to a stake. Work by Georges Delfosse.
# Father Barthélemy Vimont saying the first Mass in Montreal on May 18, 1642. Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance, the co-founders of Montreal, can be seen attending the Mass. This work by Ernest Laurent was a gift from the French government to Paul Bruchési.
# The consecration of the Associates of Montreal&#x27;s project. On February 3, 1641, noble man and women, and priests, who dreamed of founding the city of Ville-Marie in New France, attend a Mass celebrated by Jean-Jacques Olier in the Notre-Dame of Paris to pray for the protection of Our Lady for what many considered to be a &quot;foolish undertaking.&quot; Work by Georges Delfosse.
# The first Mass celebrated at Rivière-des-Prairies by Father Denis Jamet on June 24, 1615. Joseph Le Caron holds the edge of Jamay&#x27;s chasuble. Samuel de Champlain, founder of Quebec City, is in the centre. Work by Georges Delfosse.
# The martyrdom of Nicolas Viel (seen in the boat) and his disciple Ahuntsic (seen already fallen in the water) by three Amerindians on the rapids at the Sault-au-Récollet. Work by Georges Delfosse.
# Jeanne Mance, co-founder of Montreal, and the nursing sisters of Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph tend to a sick child Montreal&#x27;s first hospital, Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal. Work by Georges Delfosse.

===Statues===
In the apse is a statue of Mary, Queen of the World, patron of the cathedral, by Sylvia Daoust. In imitation of the statues of the 12 apostles on the façade of St. Peter&#x27;s, the cathedral is topped by statues of the patron saints of 13 parishes of Montreal that donated toward the cathedral, including St. John the Baptist and St. Patrick. The statues were sculpted by Olindo Gratton between 1892 and 1898 and include:
* Saint Anthony of Padua, patron of the Saint-Anthony-of-Padua parish (at 1950 Saint-Antoine Street West);
* Saint Vincent de Paul, patron of the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul parish in Laval;
* Saint Hyacinth;
* Saint Thomas Aquinas;
* Saint Paul;
* Saint John;
* Saint James the Greater, patron of this cathedral and its predecessor that was destroyed by fire, the Saint-Jacques Cathedral;
* Saint Joseph, patron of the Saint-Joseph parish in Rivière-des-Prairies;
* Saint John the Baptist, patron of the parish of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Church;
* Saint Patrick, patron of the parish of the St. Patrick&#x27;s Church;
* Saint Ignatius of Antioch;
* Saint Charles Borromeo, patron of the parish of the Saint-Charles Church in Pointe Saint-Charles;
* Saint Francis of Assisi.

Next to the church, there&#x27;s also a monument for Ignace Bourget.

=== Texts ===
Several texts in golden letters decorate the inside of the cathedral. Since the building was originally dedicated to Saint James the Greater (and it still is), it explains why most of the Latin texts refer to his life.

Texts in the nave include:

* On the side of the cathedra (east side): &quot;&quot;He [James] is one of the three Apostles whom the Savior loves the most. In Judea and Samaria he converts many to the Christian faith.&quot; (Latin: &quot;Is unus fuit ex tribus Apostolis, quos Salvator maxime dilexit. In Judæa et Samaria, plurimos ad Christianam fidem perduxit.&quot;)
* On the side of the tabernacle (west side): &quot;He also converts some people in Spain, in Jerusalem he is condemned to death. He is the first of the Apostles that bears witness to Jesus with his blood.&quot; (Latin: &quot;In Hispania aliquos convertit, Jerosolymae capite damnatus est. Primus apostolorum profuso sanguine testimonium Jesu dedit.&quot;)

The texts featured in the transepts are based on Matthew 20:22–23 and the brothers James and John asking Jesus to sit beside him, one on his left and one on his right, in his Kingdom.
* On the side of the cathedra (east side): &quot;And Jesus, answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They said to Him: We can. And he told them:&quot; (Latin: &quot;Respondens autem Iesus dixit nescitis quid petatis potestis bibere calicem quem ego bibiturus? Sum dicunt: Ei possumus. Ait illis:&quot;)
* On the side of the tabernacle (west side): &quot;My chalice indeed you shall drink, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant, [these places] belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.&quot; (Latin: &quot;Calicem quidem meum bibetis sedere autem ad dexteram meam et sinistram non est meum dare vobis sed quibus paratum est a Patre meo.&quot;)

Two other texts, both from Matthew 16:17–19, speak of the vocation of Saint Peter, head of the Apostles. These texts can also be found in the nave inside St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City.

* Inside the cupola: &quot;You are Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church. And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot; (Latin: &quot;&quot;Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, et portae inferi non praevalebunt adversus eam. Et tibi dabo claves Regni coelorum&quot;)
* In the chancel and apse: &quot;And whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in Heaven: And whatsoever you shall loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in Heaven. Feed my sheep.&quot; (Latin: &quot;Quodcumque ligaveris super terram, erit ligatum etin coelis: et quodcumque solveris super terram, erit solutum et in coelis.&quot;)
* At the base of the cupola: This text is fragmented into four physical sections. It is based on Revelation 4:8 from the Apocalypse and dedicated to the glory of God: &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord, who is, who was, and who is to come.&quot; (Latin: &quot;Sanctus sanctus sanctus Dominus qui erat qui est qui venturus est.&quot;&quot;)

<doc id="219847" wikidata="Q11679774" url="?curid=219847" title="Levinson recursion">
<text>Levinson recursion or Levinson–Durbin recursion is a procedure in linear algebra to recursively calculate the solution to an equation involving a Toeplitz matrix. The algorithm runs in time, which is a strong improvement over Gauss–Jordan elimination, which runs in Θ(&quot;n&quot;3).

The Levinson–Durbin algorithm was proposed first by Norman Levinson in 1947, improved by James Durbin in 1960, and subsequently improved to and then multiplications by W. F. Trench and S. Zohar, respectively.

Other methods to process data include Schur decomposition and Cholesky decomposition. In comparison to these, Levinson recursion (particularly split Levinson recursion) tends to be faster computationally, but more sensitive to computational inaccuracies like round-off errors.

The Bareiss algorithm for Toeplitz matrices (not to be confused with the general Bareiss algorithm) runs about as fast as Levinson recursion, but it uses space, whereas Levinson recursion uses only &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space. The Bareiss algorithm, though, is numerically stable, whereas Levinson recursion is at best only weakly stable (i.e. it exhibits numerical stability for well-conditioned linear systems).

Newer algorithms, called &quot;asymptotically fast&quot; or sometimes &quot;superfast&quot; Toeplitz algorithms, can solve in for various &quot;p&quot; (e.g. &quot;p&quot; = 2, &quot;p&quot; = 3 ). Levinson recursion remains popular for several reasons; for one, it is relatively easy to understand in comparison; for another, it can be faster than a superfast algorithm for small &quot;n&quot; (usually &quot;n&quot; &lt; 256).

== Derivation ==

=== Background ===
Matrix equations follow the form

: formula_1

The Levinson–Durbin algorithm may be used for any such equation, as long as M is a known Toeplitz matrix with a nonzero main diagonal. Here formula_2 is a known vector, and formula_3 is an unknown vector of numbers &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; yet to be determined.

For the sake of this article, &quot;ê&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a vector made up entirely of zeroes, except for its &quot;i&quot;th place, which holds the value one. Its length will be implicitly determined by the surrounding context. The term &quot;N&quot; refers to the width of the matrix above – M is an &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; matrix. Finally, in this article, superscripts refer to an &quot;inductive index&quot;, whereas subscripts denote indices. For example (and definition), in this article, the matrix T&quot;n&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix that copies the upper left &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; block from M – that is, &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = &quot;M&quot;&quot;ij&quot;.

T&quot;n&quot; is also a Toeplitz matrix, meaning that it can be written as

: formula_4

=== Introductory steps ===
The algorithm proceeds in two steps. In the first step, two sets of vectors, called the &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; vectors, are established. The forward vectors are used to help get the set of backward vectors; then they can be immediately discarded. The backwards vectors are necessary for the second step, where they are used to build the solution desired.

Levinson–Durbin recursion defines the &quot;n&quot;th &quot;forward vector&quot;, denoted formula_5, as the vector of length &quot;n&quot; which satisfies:

:formula_6

The &quot;n&quot;th &quot;backward vector&quot; formula_7 is defined similarly; it is the vector of length &quot;n&quot; which satisfies:

:formula_8

An important simplification can occur when M is a symmetric matrix; then the two vectors are related by &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1−&quot;i&quot;—that is, they are row-reversals of each other. This can save some extra computation in that special case.

=== Obtaining the backward vectors ===
Even if the matrix is not symmetric, then the &quot;n&quot;th forward and backward vector may be found from the vectors of length &quot;n&quot; − 1 as follows. First, the forward vector may be extended with a zero to obtain:

:formula_9

In going from T&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 to Tn&quot;, the extra &quot;column&quot; added to the matrix does not perturb the solution when a zero is used to extend the forward vector. However, the extra &quot;row&quot; added to the matrix &quot;has&quot; perturbed the solution; and it has created an unwanted error term &quot;ε&quot;&quot;f&quot; which occurs in the last place. The above equation gives it the value of:

: formula_10

This error will be returned to shortly and eliminated from the new forward vector; but first, the backwards vector must be extended in a similar (albeit reversed) fashion. For the backwards vector,

:formula_11

As before, the extra column added to the matrix does not perturb this new backwards vector; but the extra row does. Here we have another unwanted error &quot;ε&quot;&quot;b&quot; with value:

:formula_12

These two error terms can be used to form higher-order forward and backward vectors described as follows. Using the linearity of matrices, the following identity holds for all formula_13:

:formula_14

If &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are chosen so that the right hand side yields &quot;ê&quot;1 or &quot;ê&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then the quantity in the parentheses will fulfill the definition of the &quot;n&quot;th forward or backward vector, respectively. With those alpha and beta chosen, the vector sum in the parentheses is simple and yields the desired result.

To find these coefficients, formula_15, formula_16 are such that :
:formula_17
and respectively formula_18, formula_19 are such that :
:formula_20
By multiplying both previous equations by formula_21 one gets the following equation:
: formula_22

Now, all the zeroes in the middle of the two vectors above being disregarded and collapsed, only the following equation is left:

: formula_23

With these solved for (by using the Cramer 2×2 matrix inverse formula), the new forward and backward vectors are:

: formula_24

: formula_25

Performing these vector summations, then, gives the &quot;n&quot;th forward and backward vectors from the prior ones. All that remains is to find the first of these vectors, and then some quick sums and multiplications give the remaining ones. The first forward and backward vectors are simply:

: formula_26

=== Using the backward vectors ===
The above steps give the &quot;N&quot; backward vectors for M. From there, a more arbitrary equation is:

: formula_27

The solution can be built in the same recursive way that the backwards vectors were built. Accordingly, formula_3 must be generalized to a sequence of intermediates formula_29, such that formula_30.

The solution is then built recursively by noticing that if

: formula_31

Then, extending with a zero again, and defining an error constant where necessary:

: formula_32

We can then use the &quot;n&quot;th backward vector to eliminate the error term and replace it with the desired formula as follows:

: formula_33

Extending this method until &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot; yields the solution formula_3.

In practice, these steps are often done concurrently with the rest of the procedure, but they form a coherent unit and deserve to be treated as their own step.

== Block Levinson algorithm ==
If M is not strictly Toeplitz, but block Toeplitz, the Levinson recursion can be derived in much the same way by regarding the block Toeplitz matrix as a Toeplitz matrix with matrix elements (Musicus 1988). Block Toeplitz matrices arise naturally in signal processing algorithms when dealing with multiple signal streams (e.g., in MIMO systems) or cyclo-stationary signals.

<text>Best interests or best interests of the child is a child rights principle, which derives from Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which says that &quot;in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration&quot;. Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance &quot;all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children&quot;.

== Definition ==
According to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance &quot;all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children&quot;. Due to the diversity of factors to consider, usually more than one profession or institution is involved in the assessment process, bringing together various perspectives and areas of expertise from the country of origin and destination and, in particular, the perspective of the child.

The following aspects are relevant for the best interests of the child: 
* The child&#x27;s views and aspirations; 
* The identity of the child, including age and gender, personal history and background; 
* The care, protection and safety of the child; 
* The child&#x27;s well-being; 
* The family environment, family relations and contact;
* Social contacts of the child with peers and adults; 
* Situations of vulnerability, i.e. the risks that the child is facing and the sources of protection, resiliency and empowerment;
* The child&#x27;s skills and evolving capacities; 
* The rights and needs with regard to health and education; 
* The development of the child and her or his gradual transition into adulthood and an independent life; 
* Any other specific needs of the child.

== Assessments ==
Best interests&#x27; assessments can be conducted informally and ad hoc or as formalised processes. Assessments look at everyday matters and decisions with more or less severe implications for the child. The best interests of a child may change significantly over time as children grow and their situations and capacities evolve, so their best interests may need to be reassessed periodically.

== Determinations ==
Best interests determinations are formal processes conducted with the involvement of public authorities and professional decision makers. The objective of the best interests determination is to reach a decision based on national law that safeguards the rights of the child and promotes her or his well-being, safety and development. Decision-makers weigh and balance all the relevant factors of the case, giving due consideration to all the rights of the child and the obligations of public authorities and service providers towards the child. The objective of the best interests determination process is the identification of a durable solution. Best interests determinations are carried out when the issues at stake are expected to have significant implications on the child&#x27;s present and future life.

== Elements of a best interests assessment and determination process in transnational cases ==
Best interests assessments aim to gather all the facts needed to arrive at a conclusion about the impact of any action, measure or decision on the child and her or his future. The central perspective is that of the girl or boy concerned. A trust-based relationship and communicating effectively in the child&#x27;s main language enables the child to exercise his or her right to be heard. Comprehensive assessments involve a multi-disciplinary team of qualified professionals.

A comprehensive best interests assessment and determination process addresses all of the following: 
* Establishing the child&#x27;s identity and the identity of the child guardian and the quality of their relations, and any accompanying persons in transnational cases. 
* Case assessment, including the following components: 
** Hearing the child; 
** Assessment of the child&#x27;s situation, background and needs; 
** Social situation and family assessment;
** Gathering evidence including through forensic examinations and interviews with the child;
** Risk and security assessments;
** Mapping sources of support, skills, potentials and resources for empowerment; 
* Developing a life project. 
* Comprehensive child impact assessment of any potential decisions. 
* Identification of a durable solution in transnational cases. 
* Continued assessments during the implementation of the durable solution with due follow-up, review and monitoring, and adjustments to the durable solution arrangements, if and as required, according to the best interests of the child

== Procedural safeguards in best interests determinations ==
Procedural safeguards and documentation in best interests determinations include: 
* The right of the child to express her or his views and to have them taken into account: In a judicial or administrative procedure, children have the right to be heard and to have their views taken into account. 
**The process of hearing the child needs to be documented, with a clear description of how the child&#x27;s views are balanced against other views and other information sources. The communication with the child has to be effective and child-sensitive and might require quality interpretation and cultural mediation. In cases of unaccompanied or separated children, the role of the guardian or representative is essential to facilitate the communication between the child and the authorities. 
**The child has a right to a hearing when the decision-making body is a court. The hearing should be held without delay in a child-sensitive way and prevent secondary victimisation of child victims and witnesses in judicial proceedings. 
**The child&#x27;s age, gender and background, the child&#x27;s level of development and evolving capacities should be considered. 
**Child-friendly information in a language that the child understands, enabling the child to form an opinion and to express her or his views should be provided. 
** In transnational cases, children who do not speak the language of the country of destination have a right to translation and interpretation. Interpretation should be made available free of charge and with a neutral bearing when interpreters are directly involved. 
* Guardianship and representation: children have a right to an independent representative or guardian who is competent and equipped to represent and promote the best interests of the child. 
* Legal representation: When the best interests of a child are formally decided by a court or other competent body, the child is entitled to legal representation, legal information and defence, including for children applying for asylum or special protection as victims of crime. 
* Legal reasoning: Decisions need to be documented, motivated in detail, justified and explained, including how the decision is considered to relate to the best interests of the child and how the underlying considerations have been balanced to arrive at the decision. 
* Mechanisms to review or revise decisions: Formal mechanisms have to be in place to reopen or review decisions on the best interests of a child. Children need access to support in accessing and using these mechanisms. It has to be clearly established when a case or decision can be reopened or reviewed, as for instance when there is new evidence or when the authorities have not been able to implement the first decision. 
* Right to appeal: Best interests determinations are subject to legal remedies. Children need to have access and support, such as legal assistance and representation, to appeal a decision. During the appeal procedure the implementation is suspended. For decisions concerning transfer or return of a child to another county, sufficient time must be available between the decision and the execution of the decision, to enable the child to hand in an appeal or request a review of the decision.

==Balancing rights and interests in best interests determinations==
The different elements considered in an assessment and determination of the best interests of a child may appear to be competing or in contradiction. Potential conflicts are solved on a case-by-case basis. The right of the child to have her or his best interests taken as a primary consideration means that the child&#x27;s interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations. A larger weight is attached to what serves the child best:
* The possibility of harm outweighs other factors; 
* The child&#x27;s right to be brought up by her or his parents is a fundamental principle;
* A child&#x27;s best interests can generally best be met with her or his family, except where there are safety concerns;
* The survival and development of the child are generally ensured best by remaining in or maintaining close contacts with the family and the child&#x27;s social and cultural networks;
* Matters related to health, education and vulnerability are important factors; and 
* Continuity and stability of the child&#x27;s situation are important.

== Criticism ==

The definition of the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; is not straightforward in either legal practice or when formulating laws and conventions. Its implementation has received considerable criticism by some child psychologists, epidemiologists and the family law reform movement, particularly with regard to how it often marginalizes children from one of their parents after divorce or separation, even though a child benefit from close contact with both parents. It has been argued that the current standard should be replaced with a &quot;best interests of the child from the perspective of the child&quot; approach that takes child-focused epidemiological and psychological research into account regarding children&#x27;s physical, mental and social well-being after divorce or separation.

The best interests standard is often better suited to identifying the best of several acceptable alternatives and has less value in determining which alternatives should be deemed acceptable. Alternative models include deferring to parents or guardians when the decision falls into the zone of parental discretion (parents or guardians make choices that others consider suboptimal, but which seem better to the decision-makers and have little potential for serious harm) and the harm principle, which requires outside intervention to prevent serious harm. For example, one custody situation might be considered optimally in the best interests of the child, but a slightly different arrangement might fall into the zone of parental discretion. However, a situation that would put the child into serious danger would violate the harm principle and therefore be rejected. 

== European Union ==
Reference to the best interests of the child has been introduced into relevant EU laws and policies, including in the context of migration, asylum, trafficking and potential return. The wording attached to the best interests principle ranges between the imperative &quot;must&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; to the less prescriptive &quot;should&quot;.

== Finland ==
The Finnish Child Welfare Act provides that the best interests of the child needs to be a primary consideration in the determination of welfare measures in response to the child&#x27;s needs. The Act defines the key elements that need to be taken into consideration for a best interests determination: 
# Balanced development and well-being, close and continuing human relationships; 
# The opportunity to be given understanding and affection, as well as supervision and care in line with the child&#x27;s age and level of development; 
# An education consistent with the child&#x27;s abilities and wishes; 
# A safe environment in which to grow up, and physical and emotional freedom; 
# A sense of responsibility in becoming independent and growing up; 
# The opportunity to become involved in matters affecting the child and to influence them; and 
# The need to take account of the child&#x27;s linguistic, cultural and religious background.

This provision offers legally binding guidance to professionals on how the concept of the best interests of the child should be understood. It raises awareness of the complexity of the issues under consideration and makes reference to important rights of the child such as the right to education and development, safety and well-being, respect for the child&#x27;s views and the child&#x27;s cultural and other backgrounds.

== United States ==
Since the US has not yet ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the central instrument defining and providing the right of the best interests of the child for much of the world, a different set of laws, precedents, and applications apply.

=== History ===

The use of the best interests doctrine represented a 20th-century shift in public policy. The best interests doctrine is an aspect of &quot;parens patriae,&quot; and in the United States it has replaced the tender years doctrine, which rested on the basis that children are not resilient, and almost any change in a child&#x27;s living situation would be detrimental to their well-being.

Until the early 1900s, fathers were given custody of the children in case of divorce. Many U.S. states then shifted from this standard to one that completely favored the mother as the primary caregiver. In the 1970s, the tender years doctrine was replaced by the best interests of the child as determined by family courts. Because many family courts continued to give great weight to the traditional role of the mother as the primary caregiver, application of this standard in custody historically tended to favor the mother of the children.

The &quot;best interests of the child&quot; doctrine is sometimes used in cases where non-parents, such as grandparents, ask a court to order non-parent visitation with a child. Some parents, usually those who are not awarded custody, say that using the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; doctrine in non-parent visitation cases fails to protect a fit parent&#x27;s fundamental right to raise their child in the manner they see fit. Troxel v Granville, 530 US 57; 120 S Ct 2054; 147 LEd2d 49 (2000).

=== Child welfare laws ===

The &quot;best interest of the child&quot; doctrine is largely seen in child welfare laws and the paramount consideration of the court when making decisions with regards to abused and neglected children. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires that, &quot;…each child has a case plan designed to achieve placement in the least restrictive (most family like) setting available and in close proximity to the parents&#x27; home, consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child.&quot; Although the statute does not define the &quot;best interest of the child&quot;, best interest is referenced in two other sections. Moreover, several states have chosen to statutorily define or reference the &quot;best interest of the child&quot;, and require the courts within those jurisdictions to consider specific factors.

=== Family law ===

The term is used as doctrine used by courts to determine a wide range of issues relating to the well-being of children. In the application of family law, one of the most common of these issues concern questions that arise upon the divorce or separation of the children&#x27;s parents. Examples include:

*With whom will the children live?
*How much contact (previously termed &quot;access&quot; or, in some jurisdictions, &quot;visitation&quot;) will the parents, legal guardian, or other parties be allowed (or required) to have?
*To whom and by whom will child support be paid and in what amount?

In proceedings involving divorce or the dissolution of a common-law marriage or a civil union, family courts are directed to assess the best interests of any children of these unions. However, this doctrine is not used to settle custody matters involving urban and minority residents in cities such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for example, where the tender years doctrine is still in effect.

The determination is also used in proceedings which determine legal obligations and entitlements, such as when a child is born outside of marriage, when grandparents assert rights with respect to their grandchildren, and when biological parents assert rights with respect to a child who was given up for adoption.

It is the doctrine usually employed in cases regarding the potential emancipation of minors. Courts will use this doctrine when called upon to determine who should make medical decisions for a child where the parents disagree with healthcare providers or other authorities.

In determining the best interests of the child or children in the context of a separation of the parents, the court may order various investigations to be undertaken by social workers, Family Court Advisors from CAFCASS, psychologists and other forensic experts, to determine the living conditions of the child and his custodial and non-custodial parents. Such issues as the stability of the child&#x27;s life, links with the community, and stability of the home environment provided by each parent may be considered by a court in deciding the child&#x27;s residency in custody and visitation proceedings. In English law, section 1(1) Children Act 1989 makes the interests of any child the paramount concern of the court in all proceedings and, having indicated in s1(2) that delay is likely to prejudice the interests of any child, it requires the court to consider the &quot;welfare checklist&quot;, i.e. the court must consider:
#The ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child concerned (considered in light of their age and understanding)
#Physical, emotional and/or educational needs now and in the future
#The likely effect on any change in the circumstances now and in the future
#Age, sex, background and any other characteristics the court considers relevant
#Any harm suffered or at risk of suffering now and in the future
#How capable each parent, and other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting the child&#x27;s needs
#The range of powers available to the court under the Children Act 1989 in the proceedings in question

The welfare checklist considers the needs, wishes and feelings of the child and young person and this analysis is vital to ensure that the human rights of children are always in the forefront of all consideration. The welfare checklist provides a comprehensive list of issues that need to be considered to ensure that young people who come into court proceedings are safeguarded fully and their rights as citizens are promoted.

=== Immigration law ===

To a much lesser degree the principal of the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; has been utilized in immigration law as it relates to child migrants.

<doc id="219856" wikidata="Q134684" url="?curid=219856" title="Helicobacter">
<text>Helicobacter is a genus of gram-negative bacteria possessing a characteristic helical shape. They were initially considered to be members of the genus &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, but in 1989, Goodwin &quot;et al.&quot; published sufficient reasons to justify the new genus name &quot;Helicobacter&quot;. The genus &quot;Helicobacter&quot; contains about 35 species.

Some species have been found living in the lining of the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as the liver of mammals and some birds. The most widely known species of the genus is &quot;H. pylori&quot;, which infects up to 50% of the human population. It also serves as the type species of the genus. Some strains of this bacterium are pathogenic to humans, as they are strongly associated with peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, duodenitis, and stomach cancer.

&quot;Helicobacter&quot; species are able to thrive in the very acidic mammalian stomach by producing large quantities of the enzyme urease, which locally raises the pH from about 2 to a more biocompatible range of 6 to 7. Bacteria belonging to this genus are usually susceptible to antibiotics such as penicillin, are microaerophilic (optimal oxygen concentration between 5 and 14%) capnophiles, and are fast-moving with their flagella.

==Molecular signatures==
Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 11 proteins that are uniquely found in the Helicobacteraceae. Of these proteins, seven are found in all species of the family, while the remaining four are not found in any &quot;Helicobacter&quot; strains and are unique to &quot;Wollinella&quot;. Additionally, a rare genetic event has led to the fusion of the &quot;rpoB&quot; and &quot;rpoC&quot; genes in this family, which is characteristic of them.

==Non-&quot;H. pylori&quot; species==
Recently, new gastric (&quot;H. suis&quot; and &quot;H. baculiformis&quot;) and enterohepatic (&quot;H. equorum&quot;) species have been reported. &quot;H. pylori&quot; is of primary importance for medicine, but non-&quot;H. pylori&quot; species, which naturally inhabit mammals (except humans) and birds, have been detected in human clinical specimens. These encompass two (gastric and enterohepatic) groups, showing different organ specificity. Importantly, some species, such as &quot;H. hepaticus, H. mustelae&quot;, and probably &quot;H. bilis&quot;, exhibit carcinogenic potential in animals. They harbour many virulence genes and may cause diseases not only in animals, but also in humans. Gastric species such as &quot;H. suis&quot; (most often)&quot;, H. felis, H. bizzozeronii&quot;, and &quot;H. salomonis&quot; have been associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers in humans, and importantly, with higher risk for MALT lymphoma compared to &quot;H. pylori&quot;. 

Enterohepatic species e.g., &quot;H. hepaticus,&quot; &quot;H. bilis&quot;, and &quot;H. ganmani&quot;, have been detected by PCR, but still are not isolated from specimens of patients with hepatobiliary diseases. Moreover, they may be associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. The significance of avian helicobacters (&quot;H. pullorum, H. anseris&quot;, and &quot;H. brantae)&quot; also has been evaluated extensively. &quot;H. cinaedi&quot; and &quot;H. canis&quot; can cause severe infections, mostly in immunocompromised patients with animal exposure. Briefly, the role of these species in veterinary and human medicine is increasingly recognised. Several other topics such as isolation of still uncultured species, antibiotic resistance, and treatment regimens for infections and pathogenesis and possible carcinogenesis in humans should be evaluated.

=== &quot;H. heilmannii sensu lato&quot; ===
Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato (i.e. &quot;H. heilmanni s.l.&quot;) is a grouping of non-&quot;H. pylori&quot; &quot;Helicobacter&quot; species that take as part of their definition a similarity to &quot;H. pylori&quot; in being associated with the development of stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and extranodal marginal B cell lymphoma of the stomach in humans and animals. Most clinical studies have not identified the exact species of &quot;H. heilmanii&quot; associated with these diseases, so designated these species as &quot;H. heilmanni s.l.&quot; However, investigative studies have identified these species in some patients with the cited &quot;H. heilmanni s.l.&quot;-associated upper gastrointestinal tract diseases. The &quot;H. heilmani species&quot; identified to date in the stomachs of humans with the cited upper gastrointestinal tract diseases are: &quot;Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter salomonis, Helicobacter suis&quot;, and &quot;Helicobacter heilmannii s.s.&quot; It is important to recognize the association of &quot;H. heilmannii sensu lato&quot; with these upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, particularly extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because some of them have been successfully treated using antibiotic-based drug regimens directed against the instigating &quot;H. heilmannii sensu lato&quot; species. The &quot;H. heilmanni s.l.&quot;-associated human diseases appear to be acquired from pets and farm animals, so are considered to be zoonotic diseases.

<text>Francesco Colonna (1433/1434 – 1527) was an Italian Dominican priest and monk who was credited with the authorship of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot; by an acrostic formed by initial letters of the text.

He lived in Venice, and preached at St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral. Besides &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;, he definitely wrote a Latin epic poem, &quot;Delfili Somnium&quot; (the &quot;Dream of Delfilo&quot;), which went unpublished in his lifetime and was not published until 1959. Colonna spent part of his life in the monastery of San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, but the monastery was apparently not of the strictest observance and Colonna was granted leave to live outside its walls.
In Ian Caldwell&#x27;s and Dustin Thomason&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rule of Four&quot;, the Roman noble of the same name, Francesco Colonna, is featured as the true author of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;.
