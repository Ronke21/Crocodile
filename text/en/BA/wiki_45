<text>Traditionalist Catholicism is a movement that emphasizes beliefs, practices, customs, traditions, liturgical forms, devotions and presentations of teaching associated with the Catholic Church before the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). Traditionalist Catholics particularly emphasize the Tridentine Mass, the Roman Rite liturgy largely replaced in general use by the post-Second Vatican Council Mass of Paul VI.

Many Traditionalist Catholics disliked the liturgical changes that followed the Second Vatican Council, and prefer to continue to practice pre-Second Vatican Council traditions and forms. Some also see present teachings on ecumenism as blurring the distinction between Catholics and other Christians. Traditional Catholicism is often more conservative in its philosophy and worldview, promoting a modest style of dressing and teaching a complementarian view of gender roles.

A minority of Traditionalist Catholics reject the current papacy of the Catholic Church and follow positions of sedevacantism, sedeprivationism, or conclavism. As these groups are no longer in full communion with the pope and the Holy See, they are not regarded by Holy See to be members of the Catholic Church, but instead separate religious groupings. A distinction is often made between these groups (sometimes called &quot;Radical&quot; Traditionalists) and Catholics who accept the teachings and authority of the Catholic Church while still preferring older traditions and practices as well as the Tridentine Mass in Latin.

== History ==
Toward the end of the Second Vatican Council, Father Gommar DePauw came into conflict with Cardinal Lawrence Shehan, Archbishop of Baltimore, over the interpretation of the council&#x27;s teachings, particularly on liturgical matters. In January 1965, DePauw incorporated an organization called the Catholic Traditionalist Movement in New York State, purportedly with the support of Cardinal Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, conservative Catholics opposed to or uncomfortable with the theological, social and liturgical developments brought about by the Second Vatican Council began to coalesce. In 1973, the Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement (ORCM) was founded by two priests, Francis E. Fenton and Robert McKenna, and set up chapels in many parts of North America to preserve the Tridentine Mass. Priests who participated in this were listed as being on a leave of absence by their bishops, who disapproved of their actions.

In 1970, French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre founded the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), made up of priests who would say only the Traditional Latin Mass and who opposed what he saw as excessive liberal influences in the Church after Vatican II. In 1988, Lefebvre and another bishop consecrated four men as bishops without papal permission, resulting in excommunication &quot;latae sententiae&quot; for all six men directly involved. Some members of the SSPX, unwilling to participate in what they considered schism, left and founded the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP), which celebrates the Tridentine Mass and is in full communion with the Holy See. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunications of the four surviving bishops, but clarified that the society had &quot;no canonical status within the Catholic Church.&quot;

The Istituto Mater Boni Consilii (IMBC) was founded in 1985. It is a sedeprivationist religious congregation of clergy who were dissatisfied with the SSPX&#x27;s position on the Pope, i.e., acknowledging John Paul II as pope but disobeying him. Sedeprivationists hold that the current occupant of the papal office is a duly elected pope but lacks the authority and ability to teach or govern unless he recants the changes brought by the Second Vatican Council.

Some Catholics took the position of sedevacantism, which teaches Pope John XXIII and his successors are heretics and therefore cannot be considered popes, and that the Catholic Church&#x27;s sacraments are not valid. One sedevacantist group, the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV), broke off from the SSPX in 1983, due to liturgical disputes. Another sedevacantist group, the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI), formed spontaneously among the followers of Francis Schuckardt, but he was later expelled due to scandals and CMRI is now more aligned with other sedevacantist groups. 

Other groups known as Conclavists have elected their own popes in opposition to the post-Vatican II pontiffs. They are not considered serious claimants except by their very few followers.

==Different types==

===Canonically regular with the Holy See===
Since the Second Vatican Council, several traditionalist organizations have been started with or have subsequently obtained approval from the Catholic Church. These organizations accept the documents of the Second Vatican Council and regard the changes associated with the Council (such as the revision of the Mass) as legitimate, but celebrate the older forms with the approval of the Holy See.
* Priestly Fraternity of St Peter (FSSP)
* Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP, ICRSS)
* Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer (FSSR)
* Institute of the Good Shepherd (IBP)
* Servants of Jesus and Mary (SJM)
* Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem (CRNJ)
* Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius (SJC)
* Canons Regular of the Holy Cross
* Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer
* Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney (PAASJV)

There are also multiple monastic communities, including
* Monastery of Our Lady of the Annunciation of Clear Creek
* Monastery of St. Benedict in Norcia
* Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel
* Monastery of Our Lady of the Cenacle
* Le Barroux Abbey

See Communities using the Tridentine Mass for a more detailed list.

=== Society of Saint Pius X ===
The Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) was founded in 1970, with the authorization of the bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Lefebvre was declared to have incurred automatic excommunication in 1988, after illicit consecrations. In January 2009 the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops remitted the excommunications the Congregation had declared to have been incurred by the Society&#x27;s bishops in 1988.

More recently, the Vatican has granted SSPX priests the authority to hear confessions and has authorized local ordinaries, in certain circumstances, to grant delegation to SSPX priests to act as the qualified witness required for valid celebration of marriage. The Our Lady of Guadalupe Monastery in Silver City, New Mexico, which is affiliated with the SSPX, is seeking Vatican approval through the society.

In 2017, a statement from the Holy See said the SSPX had an irregular canonical status &quot;for the time being&quot;.

===Sedeprivationists===

Sedeprivationists hold the view that the current occupant of the papal office is a duly elected pope but lacks the authority and ability to teach or govern unless he recants the changes brought by the Second Vatican Council. Sedeprivationists teach that the popes from Pope John XXIII onward fall into this category. Sedeprivationism is currently endorsed by two groups:

* Istituto Mater Boni Consilii (IMBC), led by Superior General Fr. Francesco Ricossa;
* Roman Catholic Institute (RCI), led by Bishop Donald Sanborn.

===Sedevacantists===

Sedevacantists hold the view that the Vatican II popes have forfeited their position through their acceptance of heretical teachings connected with the Second Vatican Council and consequently there is at present no true pope. They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and of certain aspects of postconciliar Church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false. This is a minority position among traditionalist Catholics and a highly divisive one, so that many who hold it prefer to say nothing of their view, while other sedevacantists have accepted episcopal ordination from sources such as Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục.

The terms &quot;sedevacantist&quot; and &quot;sedevacantism&quot; derive from the Latin phrase &quot;sede vacante&quot; (&quot;while the chair/see [of Saint Peter] is vacant&quot;). Sedevacantist groups include:

* Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI), formed in 1967. It operates in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia; is based in Omaha, Nebraska, United States; and is headed by Bishop Mark Pivarunas.
* Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV), formed in 1983 when nine American priests of the Society of Saint Pius X split from the organization over a number of issues including using the liturgical reforms implemented under Pope John XXIII. It operates in North America, is based in Oyster Bay Cove, New York, United States, and was headed by Bishop Clarence Kelly until his death in December 2023.
* (Priestly Society of Trent; SST), formed in 1993 by the priests of the deceased Bishop Moisés Carmona. Its bishop is Bishop Martín Dávila Gandara.

===Conclavists===

Conclavism is the belief and practice of some who, claiming that all recent occupants of the papal see are not true popes, elect someone else and propose him as the true pope to whom the allegiance of Catholics is due.

==Positions==

Pope Benedict XVI contrasted the &quot;hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture&quot; that some apply to the Council (an interpretation adopted both by certain traditionalists and by certain &quot;progressives&quot;) with the &quot;hermeneutic of reform, as it was presented first by Pope John XXIII in his Speech inaugurating the Council on 11 October 1962 and later by Pope Paul VI in his Discourse for the Council&#x27;s conclusion on 7 December 1965.&quot; He made a similar point in a speech to the bishops of Chile in 1988, when he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger:[Archbishop Lefebvre] declared that he has finally understood that the agreement he signed aimed only at integrating his foundation into the &quot;Conciliar Church&quot;. The Catholic Church in union with the Pope is, according to him, the &#x27;Conciliar Church&#x27; which has broken with its own past. It seems indeed that he is no longer able to see that we are dealing with the Catholic Church in the totality of its Tradition, and that Vatican II belongs to that.Responding to a comment that some consider tradition in a rigid way, Pope Francis remarked in 2016, &quot;there&#x27;s a traditionalism that is a rigid fundamentalism; this is not good. Fidelity on the other hand implies growth. In transmitting the deposit of faith from one epoch to another, tradition grows and consolidates itself with the passing of time, as St Vincent of Lérins said [...] &#x27;The dogma of the Christian religion too must follow these laws. It progresses, consolidates itself with the years, developing itself with time, deepening itself with age&#x27;.&quot;

===Radical Traditionalists&#x27; assessment of Vatican II===
Radical Traditionalists&#x27; claims that substantive changes have taken place in Catholic teaching and practice since the Council often crystallize around the following specific alleged examples:

* Sedevacantist Donald J. Sanborn rejects an ecclesiology that he claims fails to recognize the Catholic Church as the one true church established by Jesus Christ, and instead holds that the Roman Catholic Church is some subset of the church Christ founded. He sees some of the confusion as stemming from an unclear understanding of the phrase &quot;subsists in&quot; which appears in the Vatican II document &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, and which the Church has declared applies uniquely to the Catholic Church and means the &quot;perduring, historical continuity and permanence of all the elements instituted by Christ in the Catholic Church, in which the Church of Christ is concretely found on this earth&quot;. He claims that this &quot;new ecclesiology&quot; contradicts Pope Pius XII&#x27;s &quot;Mystici corporis Christi&quot; and other papal documents.

* The SSPX denounces a teaching on collegiality that attributes to the bishops of the world a share, with the Pope, of responsibility for the Church&#x27;s governance in a way that it claims is destructive of papal authority and encourages a &quot;national&quot; church mentality that undermines the primacy of the Holy See. It also claims that national bishops&#x27; conferences, whose influence greatly increased following the Council, &quot;diminish the personal responsibility of bishop[s]&quot; within their dioceses.

=== Criticism of the Radical Traditionalists&#x27; positions ===
Those who in response to these criticisms by certain traditionalists defend the decisions of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent changes made by the Holy See make the following counterclaims:
* The criticisms are false, exaggerated, or lacking appreciation of the organic character of Tradition, traditionalist criticisms that &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; contradicts the Church&#x27;s earlier teaching on religious liberty are an example.
* Traditionalists who claim that there has been a break from and discontinuity with the Church&#x27;s traditional teaching are displaying a Protestant attitude of &quot;private judgment&quot; on matters of doctrine instead of accepting the guidance of the Magisterium of the Church.
* Traditionalists fail to distinguish properly between changeable pastoral practices (such as the liturgy of the Mass) and the unchangeable principles of the Catholic faith (such as the dogmas surrounding the Mass).
* Traditionalists of this kind treat papal authority in much the same way as the dissident, liberal Catholics. While liberals believe that, on sexual matters, &quot;the Pope can teach whatever he wants... but whether or not he should be listened to is very much an open question&quot;, the stance of certain traditionalists on the reform of the Mass liturgy and contemporary teachings on ecumenism and religious liberty amounts to the view that, on these issues, &quot;faithful Catholics are always free to resist [the Pope&#x27;s] folly. [...] As theories of religious dissent go, Catholic liberals couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.&quot;
* Traditionalists claim that the Second Vatican Council was pastoral (and not infallible), but Paul VI subsequently emphasized the authoritative nature of the Council&#x27;s teachings.

===Reception===
Integrism is traditionalist Catholicism that integrates social and political contexts. Kay Chadwick described Catholic integrism as a holding &quot;anti-Masonic, anti-liberal and anti-Communist&quot; political objectives. She also noted its alignment with the right-wing press and an annual Parisian Joan of Arc procession with participation by both integrists and National Front supporters. A Tridentine Mass was celebrated before the annual National Front party meeting. Lefebvre was fined in France for &quot;racial defamation&quot; and &quot;incitement to racial hatred&quot; for proposing the removal of immigrants – particularly Muslims – from Europe. Lefebvre also supported Latin American dictatorships, Charles Maurras, Philippe Pétain, and the continued occupation of French Algeria.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) used the term &quot;radical traditionalist Catholics&quot; to refer to those who &quot;may make up the largest single group of serious anti-Semites in America, subscribe to an ideology that is rejected by the Vatican and some 70 million mainstream American Catholics. Many of their leaders have been condemned and even excommunicated by the official church.&quot; The SPLC claims that adherents of radical traditional Catholicism &quot;routinely pillory Jews as &#x27;the perpetual enemy of Christ&#x27;&quot;, reject the ecumenical efforts of the Vatican, and sometimes assert that all recent Popes are illegitimate. The SPLC says that adherents are &quot;incensed by the liberalizing reforms&quot; of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) which condemned hatred for Jewish people and &quot;rejected the accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for deicide in the form of the crucifixion of Christ&quot; and that &quot;Radical traditional Catholics&quot; also embrace &quot;extremely conservative social ideals with respect to women.&quot;

The SPLC clarifies: &quot;Radical traditionalists are not the same as Catholics who call themselves &#x27;traditionalists&#x27;—people who prefer the old Latin Mass to the mass now typically said in vernacular languages—although the radicals, as well, like their liturgy in Latin.&quot;

==Practices==
Traditionalist Catholicism has been described as &quot;a self-conscious revival of the liturgies, practices, and trappings of an earlier time in the Catholic Church&quot; and this manifests in a number of ways.

===Rite of Mass===
The best-known and most visible sign of Catholic traditionalism is an attachment to the form that the Roman Rite liturgy of the Mass had before the liturgical reform of 1969–1970, in the various editions of the Roman Missal published between 1570 and 1962. This form is generally known as the Tridentine Mass, though traditionalists usually prefer to call it the &quot;Traditional Mass&quot;. Many refer to it as the &quot;Latin Mass&quot;, though Latin is the language also of the official text of the post-Vatican II Mass, to which vernacular translations are obliged to conform, and canon law states that &quot;the eucharistic celebration is to be carried out &quot;in the Latin language&quot; or in another language provided that the liturgical texts have been legitimately approved.&quot; In his 2007 motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; Pope Benedict XVI relaxed the regulations on use of the 1962 Missal, designating it &quot;an&quot; extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, as opposed to &quot;the&quot; ordinary or normal form, as revised successively by Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II. 

The Pope ruled that priests of the Latin Church can freely choose between the 1962 Roman Missal and the later edition &quot;in Masses celebrated without the people&quot;. Such celebrations may be attended by those who spontaneously ask to be allowed. Priests in charge of churches can permit stable groups of laypeople attached to the earlier form to have Mass celebrated for them in that form, provided that the celebrating priest is &quot;qualified to [celebrate] and not juridically impeded&quot;. The Society of Saint Pius X welcomed the document, but referred to &quot;difficulties that still remain&quot;, including &quot;disputed doctrinal issues&quot; and the notice of excommunication that still affected its bishops.

In 2021, Pope Francis promulgated &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, amending and abrogating parts of &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;.

===Individual and private devotions===
Some traditionalist Catholics stress on following customs prevailing immediately before the Second Vatican Council, such as the following:
* Fasting from Midnight until the reception of Holy Communion. The traditional Catholic rule of fasting from midnight until the reception of Holy Communion (this Eucharistic Fast is from both food and liquids), which is required by the 1917 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, was shortened in 1953 by Pope Pius XII to a 3-hour fast. In 1966, Pope Paul VI reduced the fast further to one hour, a rule included in the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. Some traditional Catholics groups require fasting from midnight until they receive Holy Communion at Mass, while others will keep a Eucharistic fast for at least three hours.
* Kneeling to receive Communion directly upon the tongue, under the Host species alone, and from the hand of a cleric rather than a layperson. The SSPX regards the practice of receiving communion in the hand (though ancient and authorised by the Holy See) as an abuse.
* Women wearing a headcovering when praying at home and when worshipping inside a church which is discussed in 1 Corinthians 11 and required by the 1917 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. Many Traditionalist Catholic women wear a veil, a hat, or a headscarf when praying at home and when worshipping inside a church.

===Clothing and lifestyle===
Traditional Catholics, with respect to male and female gender roles, often adhere to the doctrine of complementarianism.

The standards of clothing among Traditional Catholics, based on instructions given by Pope Pius XI and consequently promoted by the Purity Crusade of Mary Immaculate, is referred to as &quot;Mary-like Modesty&quot;, which includes for women, wearing sleeves &quot;extending at least to the elbows&quot; and &quot;skirts reaching below the knees&quot;, as well as having a neckline no more than two inches with the rest of the bodice fully covered. 

It is commonplace for women who identify as traditionalist Catholics to wear a head covering (veil) while praying at home and attending celebrations of the Mass.

==In the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church==
Since the Second Vatican Council, various Eastern Catholic Churches have removed some practices and emphases that were derived from those of the Latin Church. Opposition to this has been given relatively high publicity with regard to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC).

=== Background ===
Even before the Second Vatican Council, the Holy See declared it important to guard and preserve whole and entire forever the customs and distinct forms for administering the sacraments in use in the Eastern Catholic Churches (Pope Leo XIII, encyclical &quot;Orientalium Dignitas&quot;). Leo&#x27;s successor Pope Pius X said that the priests of the newly created Russian Catholic Church should offer the Divine Liturgy &quot;Nec Plus, Nec Minus, Nec Aliter&quot; (&quot;No more, No Less, No Different&quot;) than priests of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Old Believers.

In the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, liturgical de-latinization began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. According to his biographer Cyril Korolevsky, Metropolitan Andrey opposed use of coercion against those who remained attached to Latin liturgical practices, fearing that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the 1666 Schism within the Russian Orthodox Church.

De-latinization in the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; of the Second Vatican Council) and several subsequent documents. Latinizations were discarded within the Ukrainian diaspora, while among Byzantine Catholics in Western Ukraine, forced into a clandestine existence following the Soviet ban on the UGCC, the latinizations remained, &quot;an important component of their underground practices&quot;. In response, some priests, nuns, and candidates for the priesthood found themselves, &quot;forced towards the periphery of the church since 1989 because of their wish to &#x27;keep the tradition&#x27;.&quot; In some eparchies, particularly those of Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil-Zboriv, the bishops would immediately suspend any priest who, &quot;displayed his inclination toward &#x27;traditionalist&#x27; practices&quot;.

Vlad Naumescu reports that an article in the February 2003 issue of &quot;Patriayarkhat&quot;, the official journal of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, written by a student of the Ukrainian Catholic University, which since its 1994 foundation has been, &quot;the strongest progressive voice within the Church&quot;. The article named priests and parishes in every eparchy in Ukraine as being involved in &quot;a well-organized movement&quot; and who described themselves as &quot;traditionalists&quot;. According to the article, they constituted &quot;a parallel structure&quot; with connections with the Society of St. Pius X and with a charismatic leader in Fr. Basil Kovpak, the Pastor of St. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Church in the suburb of Lviv-Riasne.

According to Vlad Naumescu, &quot;Religious life in a traditionalist parish followed the model of the &#x27;underground church.&#x27; Devotions were more intense, with each priest promoting his parish as a &#x27;place of pilgrimage&#x27; for the neighboring areas, thus drawing larger crowds on Sunday than his local parish could provide. On Sundays and feast days, religious services took place three times a day (in Riasne), and the Sunday liturgy lasted for two and a half to three hours. The main religious celebrations took place outside the church in the middle of the neighborhood, and on every occasion traditionalists organized long processions through the entire locality. The community was strongly united by its common opponent, re-enacting the model of the &#x27;defender of faith&#x27; common to times of repression. This model, which presupposes clear-cut attitudes and a firm moral stance, mobilized the community and reproduced the former determination of the &#x27;underground&#x27; believers.&quot;

=== Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat ===
The Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat (SSJK), which operates a seminary, Basilian convent, and numerous parishes, receives priestly orders from the bishops of the SSPX. Its superior, Father Basil Kovpak, has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinise.

In 2003, Cardinal Liubomyr Huzar, Major Archbishops of Kyiv-Galicia, excommunicated Father Kovpak, but this act was later declared null and void by the Roman Rota due to lack of canonical form.

On 22 November 2006, Bishop Richard Williamson, who was then a member of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), ordained two priests and seven deacons in Warsaw, Poland, for the SSJK. Fr. John Jenkins, an SSPX priest who was present, later remarked, &quot;We were all very edified by their piety, and I myself was astonished by the resemblance of the atmosphere amongst the seminarians with that which I knew in the seminary – this in spite of the difference of language, nationality and even rite.&quot;

Archeparch Ihor Vozniak of Lviv, the Archeparchy in which the PSSJ is most active, denounced the ordinations as a &quot;criminal act&quot;, and condemned Fr. Kovpak&#x27;s participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests whom Bishop Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the Archeparchy. Officials of the Lviv archdiocese said that Kovpak could face excommunication, and that &quot;&#x27;he deceives the church by declaring that he is a Greek (Byzantine) Catholic priest,&#x27; while supporting a group &quot;[SSPX]&quot; that uses the old Latin liturgy exclusively, eschewing the Byzantine tradition, and does not maintain allegiance to the Holy See.&quot;

Father Kovpak&#x27;s excommunication process was restarted by the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and was confirmed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 23 November 2007.

=== Sedevacantism and Conclavism in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ===
In March 2008 a group of Basilian priests in Pidhirtsi, Ukraine, announced that four of them had been consecrated as bishops in order to save the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) from heresy and apostasy and in August 2009, they announced the formation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church. Having elected Czech Basilian priest Fr. Anthony Elias Dohnal as &quot;Patriarch Elijah&quot;, they declared that the Holy See was vacant, establishing the Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church (UOGCC).

The group was promptly excommunicated by the UGCC, an act that was later confirmed by the Apostolic Signatura and the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith.

The UOGCC later &quot;elected&quot; a new Pope, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, in October 2019. Whether Viganò accepted this &quot;election&quot; is unclear. 

There have been allegations in both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the Lviv-based newspaper &quot;Expres&quot; that the church leadership is linked to the Russian intelligence services.

== Relations with the Holy See ==
The Holy See recognises as fully legitimate the preference that many Catholics have for the earlier forms of worship. This was stated in Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1988 apostolic letter &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot; and Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s 2007 motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;. The Holy See does not extend its approval to those who oppose the present-day Church leadership, which is reiterated in &quot;Traditionis Custodes&quot;.

=== &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot; Commission ===
The Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei was founded in July 1988 in the wake of John Paul II&#x27;s apostolic letter &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot;. Benedict XVI was a member of the Commission during his tenure as Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Speaking on 16 May 2007 to the Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean, Cardinal Castrillón, the current head of the Commission, said his department had been founded for the care of those &quot;traditionalist Catholics&quot; who, while discontented with the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council, had broken with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre &quot;because they disagreed with his schismatic action in ordaining Bishops without the required papal mandate&quot;. He added that at present the Commission&#x27;s activity is not limited to the service of those Catholics, nor to &quot;the efforts undertaken to end the regrettable schismatic situation and secure the return of those brethren belonging to the Fraternity of Saint Pius X to full communion.&quot; It extends also, he said, to &quot;satisfying the just aspirations of people, unrelated to the two aforementioned groups, who, because of their specific sensitiveness, wish to keep alive the earlier Latin liturgy in the celebration of the Eucharist and the other sacraments.&quot;

In 2019, Pope Francis suppressed this commission and transferred its responsibilities directly to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

==Validity of holy orders==

The conferring of holy orders may be valid but illicit. The Catholic Church considers the orders of traditionalist clergy who are in good standing with the Holy See, such as the clergy of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter or the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, to be both valid and licit. It sees as valid but illicit the orders of the bishops and priests of the Society of Saint Pius X, and accordingly considers them to be forbidden by law to exercise priestly offices, but still technically priests.

The Holy See declared devoid of canonical effect the consecration ceremony conducted by Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục for the Carmelite Order of the Holy Face group on December 31,1975, while expressly refraining from pronouncing on its validity. It made the same statement with regard also to any later ordinations that those bishops might confer, saying that: as for those who have already thus unlawfully received ordination or any who may yet accept ordination from these, whatever may be the validity of the orders (&quot;quidquid sit de ordinum validitate&quot;), the Church does not and will not recognise their ordination (&quot;ipsorum ordinationem&quot;), and will consider them, for all legal effects, as still in the state in which they were before, except that the [...] penalties remain until they repent.

==Demographics==

In 2005, Catholic World News reported that &quot;the Vatican&quot; estimated the number of those served by the Fraternity of St Peter, the Society of St Pius X and similar groups at &quot;close to 1 million&quot;.

==List of groups==

This is a list of notable traditionalist Catholic groups. Some are in full communion with the Holy See; some have irregular status according to doctrines and disciplines of the Catholic Church.

As of 2023, largest priestly communities described as traditionalist are Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) with 707 priests, Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP) with 368 priests, Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP) with 147 priests and Institute of the Good Shepherd (IBP) with 61 priests.

<text>The Linux Gazette was a monthly self-published Linux computing webzine, published between July 1995 and June 2011. Its content was published under the Open Publication License.

==History==
It was started in July 1995 by John M. Fisk as a free service. He went on to pursue his studies and become a medical doctor. At Mr. Fisk&#x27;s request, the publication was sponsored and managed by SSC (Specialized System Consultants, who at that time were also publishers of Linux Journal). The content was always provided by volunteers, including most of the editorial oversight.

After those years, the volunteer staff and the management of SSC had a schism (see Bifurcation below). Both the volunteer-run magazine and the magazine run by SSC has been closed down.

One way Linux Gazette differed from other, similar, webzines (and magazines) was &quot;The Answer Gang&quot;. In addition to providing a regular page devoted to questions and answers, questions to The Answer Gang were answered on a mailing list, and the subsequent conversations are edited and published as conversations. This started with an arrangement between Marjorie Richardson and Jim Dennis (whom she dubbed &quot;The Answer Guy&quot;). She&#x27;d forward questions to him; he&#x27;d answer them to the original querent and copy her on the reply; then, she&#x27;d gather up all of those, and include them in the monthly help desk column.

With its motto, &quot;Making Linux just a little more fun&quot;, the magazine always had a finger on the pulse of Linux&#x27;s open, collaborating, and sharing culture.

The last issue (#186) was published in June 2011.

==Bifurcation==
Fisk transferred the management of the Linux Gazette to SSC (under Phil Hughes) in 1996 in order to pursue medical studies, on the understanding that the publication would continue to be open, free, and non-commercial.

In October 2003, the Linux Gazette split into two competing groups. The staff of LinuxGazette.net, however, said that their decision to start their own version of Linux Gazette was due to several factors: SSC&#x27;s assertion that Linux Gazette would no longer be edited or released in monthly issues, as well as the removal of material from older issues without notifying the authors.

SSC attempted to assert trademark claims over the publication. LinuxGazette.net contributing editor Rick Moen, however, addressed this claim in an article for LinuxGazette.net: 
The very same day it received our notice of the magazine&#x27;s departure, SSC, Inc. suddenly filed a US $300 fee and trademark application #78319880 with the USA Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), requesting registration of the name &quot;Linux Gazette&quot; as a service mark. On that form, SSC certified that it had used the mark in commerce starting August 1, 1996. ... SSC&#x27;s recent legal claim to hegemony over the name &quot;Linux Gazette&quot; strikes us as outrageously unmerited, and cheeky.

Starting May 30, 2004, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Trademark Electronic Business Center&#x27;s TDR (Text Document Retrieval) online record showed a USPTO &quot;Office Action&quot; on application #78319880, summarily refusing registration on grounds that the proposed mark &quot;merely describes the subject matter and nature of the applicant&#x27;s goods and/or services&quot;, and also because publishing a journal is not per se a &quot;service&quot; within the meaning of the term in trademark law (SSC having not provided descriptive evidence or arguments to counter that presumption). The notice gave SSC six months to cure these deficiencies. On Dec. 27, 2004, USPTO&#x27;s follow-up Notice of Abandonment ruled that &quot;The trademark application below was abandoned because a response to the Office Action mailed on 05-30-2004 was not received within the 6-month response period&quot;, adding that any request for reinstatement would have to be received within two additional months. On Jan. 6, 2005, USPTO noted return of its Notice of Abandonment by the post office: &quot;Not deliverable as addressed. Unable to forward.&quot;

The magazine run by SSC was closed down, and for an undisclosed reason the volunteer-run magazine was also abandoned. In early 2006, SSC closed the Web site at LinuxGazette.com, and made it an HTTP redirect to the Linux Journal site.

<doc id="218225" wikidata="Q7498727" url="?curid=218225" title="Shirley Crabtree">
<text>Shirley Crabtree Jr. (14 November 1930 – 2 December 1997), better known as Big Daddy, was an English professional wrestler. He worked for Joint Promotions and the original British Wrestling Federation. Initially appearing on television as a heel, he teamed with Giant Haystacks. After splitting with Haystacks, he became a fan favourite and the top star of Joint Promotions from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.

==Early life==
Shirley Crabtree Jr., was the first child of a blacksmith&#x27;s daughter and weighed about twelve pounds at birth. He was given the name Shirley, like his father, who was a professional player of rugby league for Halifax R.L.F.C. and part of the team that won the Challenge Cup at Wembley in 1931. Shirley was traditionally a man&#x27;s name but had become popular as a girl&#x27;s name following the Charlotte Brontë novel, &quot;Shirley&quot;. In the 1930s, the name was especially associated with the child movie-star, Shirley Temple, and so the boy was teased and bullied at school. His father abandoned the family when his son was seven, and so the bullying toughened up the young Crabtree in the manner portrayed by &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;,

== Professional wrestling career ==
===Early career===
Shirley Crabtree Jr., decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, Shirley Crabtree Sr., becoming a professional wrestler in 1952. He first became popular in the late 1950s, and early 1960s as a blue-eye billed as &quot;Blond Adonis Shirley Crabtree.&quot; He won the European Heavyweight Championship in Joint Promotions and a disputed branch of the British Heavyweight title in the independent British Wrestling Federation before he quit in 1966 following a (non-&quot;kayfabe&quot;) campaign of harassment at wrestling shows by former champion Bert Assirati. He retired for roughly six years. During the 1960s Crabtree owned an underground nightclub in Bradford which is now called Sunbridge Wells.

===Comeback===
In 1972, Crabtree returned to Joint Promotions as a villain with a gimmick of the Battling Guardsman based on his former service with the Coldstream Guards. It was during this period that he made his first appearances on &quot;World of Sport&quot; on ITV.

Not long afterwards, Shirley&#x27;s brother, Max, was appointed as Northern area booker with Joint Promotions and began to transform Crabtree into the persona for which he would be best remembered. Based originally on the character of the same name played by actor Burl Ives in the first screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; was first given life by Crabtree in late 1974, initially still as a villain. The character&#x27;s leotards were emblazoned with just a large &quot;D&quot; and were crafted by Shirley&#x27;s wife Eunice, from the chintz settee of the family home. The character first gained attention in mid-1975 when he formed a tag team with TV newcomer Giant Haystacks and together they became notorious as &#x27;villains&#x27; crushing blue eye opponents. During this period, Daddy was cheered by the audience, for the first time since his comeback, when he entered into a feud with masked villain Kendo Nagasaki, especially when he pulled off Nagasaki&#x27;s mask during a televised contest from Solihull in December 1975 (although the unmasked Nagasaki quickly won the bout moments later).

By the middle of 1977, Big Daddy had completed his transformation into a blue eye, a change cemented by the breakdown of his tag team with Haystacks and a subsequent feud between the two which would last until the early 1990s. A firm fans&#x27; favourite particularly amongst children, Big Daddy came to the ring in either a sequinned cape or a Union Flag jacket and top hat. In addition to his feud with Haystacks, Daddy also feuded with Canadian wrestler &quot;Mighty&quot; John Quinn. He headlined Wembley Arena with singles matches against Quinn in 1979 and Haystacks in 1981, as well as a tag match in 1980 with Wayne Bridges against Quinn and Yasu Fuji. Later in the 1980s he feuded with Dave &quot;Fit&quot; Finlay, Drew McDonald and numerous other villains.

In August 1987 at the Hippodrome circus in Great Yarmouth, Big Daddy performed in a tag team match pitting himself and nephew Steve Crabtree (billed as &quot;Greg Valentine&quot;) against King Kong Kirk and King Kendo. After Big Daddy had delivered a splash and pinned King Kong Kirk, rather than selling the impact of the finishing move, Kirk turned an unhealthy colour and was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Despite the fact that the inquest into Kirk&#x27;s death found that he had a serious heart condition and cleared Crabtree of any responsibility, Crabtree was devastated.

He continued to make regular appearances into the early 1990s, but he eventually retired from wrestling altogether in 1993 to spend the remainder of his days in his home town of Halifax. During his career, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Elizabeth II said they were fans of &quot;Big Daddy&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Crabtree was a professional rugby league footballer for Bradford Northern. His temper often forced him off the pitch early. He also had stints as a coal miner and with the British Army&#x27;s Coldstream Guards.

His brother Brian Crabtree was a wrestling referee and later MC, while his younger brother Max was a booker for – and later proprietor of – Joint Promotions. His nephews Steve and Spencer Crabtree also had wrestling careers – Steve wrestled in the 1980s, and 1990s, billed as &#x27;Greg Valentine&#x27; (named after the American wrestler of the same name) while Spencer wrestled as Scott Valentine. Both worked as tag team partners for their uncle. Another nephew; Eorl Crabtree is a former rugby league footballer for England and the Huddersfield Giants.

Crabtree died of a stroke on 2 December 1997 in Halifax General Hospital. He was survived by his second wife of 31 years, Eunice and six children.

==Other media==
Big Daddy had his own comic strip in &quot;Buster&quot; during the early 1980s drawn by Mike Lacey. In 1982 ITV planned to build a TV programme around &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; as a replacement for the popular children&#x27;s Saturday morning &quot;Tiswas&quot; show. A pilot for &quot;Big Daddy&#x27;s Saturday Show&quot; was shot and a series announced but Crabtree pulled out at the last moment, leaving the hastily renamed &quot;The Saturday Show&quot; presented by Isla St Clair and Tommy Boyd.

A stage play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, &quot;Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks&quot;, premiered at the Brighton Festival Fringe in East Sussex, England between 26–28 May 2011 and subsequently toured Great Britain.

Big Daddy is referenced on Luke Haines&#x27; 2011 album &quot;9 1/2 Psychedelic Meditations on British Wrestling of the 1970s &amp; Early &#x27;80s&quot;, as the owner of a Casio VL-Tone synthesizer.

In late 2021, Big Daddy had a Retro figure released through Chella toys for a 2022 release.

<doc id="218230" wikidata="Q7900173" url="?curid=218230" title="Urban survival syndrome">
<text>The urban survival syndrome, in United States jurisprudence, can be used either as a defense of justification or of excuse. The first case using, unsuccessfully, the defense of &quot;urban survival syndrome&quot; is the 1994 Fort Worth, Texas murder trial of Daimion Osby.

The use of the urban survival syndrome as a defense to criminal charges followed the success of the battered woman syndrome defense in &quot;State v. Kelly&quot; (1984), which was based on the acceptance that the presence of such a syndrome may cause the defendant, a victim of domestic violence, to reasonably believe she was in peril and was therefore justified in using deadly force, given the circumstances.

==Defense==
As an excuse defense, the urban survival syndrome is presented as a version of the abuse defense. Here an individual experiencing the daily life of racial segregation and violence common in many inner cities in the United States causes a subjective state equivalent to that caused by survival in a violent battleground of war. As such it leads to a condition similar to a syndrome already recognized in both psychological and psychiatric practices, that is, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

As a justification defense, the urban survival syndrome is offered to bolster self-defense claims in which a defendant argues that he or she should not be held criminally responsible for actions which broke the law, as the defendant was objectively reasonable in believing his or her lethal actions were necessary for survival. In this case, the act would be termed justifiable homicide. A defense of justification is a codification of the common law defense of necessity.

==History==
===&quot;State v. Brown&quot;===
In &quot;State v. Brown&quot;, 91 N.M. 320, 573, P.2d 675 (N.M. 1977), the court was dealing with a similar situation to that of Osby, and a justification defense was used. The term, urban survival syndrome, had not yet come into being. Brown, a black man living in an inner city neighborhood, was charged with two counts of assault with intent to kill upon a police officer. Brown said that he was in fear of the police officers and acted in self-defense when he shot them. The court allowed defense witnesses to describe the verbal and physical harassment of blacks by police officers, including Brown, although the court refused to allow a social psychologist to testify describing studies of police conduct toward minority groups, nor those that concluded that minority groups might perceive police officers as hostile to them and would be apt to fear them in any street encounter. These studies could offer evidence of justification. Brown was convicted and appealed.

The New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed the decision to exclude expert testimony and remanded the case back for a new trial. The court felt such testimony supported Brown in his claim that he was in fear of immediate bodily harm when he shot the police officers, rather than acting out of anger and rejection of authority, as the prosecution alleged. Therefore, evidence bearing on Brown&#x27;s state of mind at the time of the offense had been excluded as a reversible error.

===&quot;People v. Goetz&quot;===
In &quot;People v. Goetz&quot;, 68 N.Y.2d 96 (N.Y. 1986), Bernhard Goetz, a white man, used the defense of a subjective state of terror and fear to justify the shooting of four black teenagers on a New York City subway. The court held that the test for whether the use of deadly force is justified should be entirely subjective and focus on the defendant&#x27;s state of mind at the time of the incident and dismissed the criminal indictments of attempted murder, assault, and reckless endangerment. However, upon appeal the New York Court of Appeals, in a unanimous finding, held that the use of an entirely subjective test to determine the appropriateness of deadly physical force by a defendant could permit a jury to acquit every defendant who believed that his actions were reasonable, regardless of how bizarre the rationale, creating a slippery slope. The jury could determine a different reasonable test for every single defendant claiming justification. The Court explained that the justification statute requires an objective element; deadly physical force is only permissible if a reasonable person would believe that he is in imminent fear of serious physical injury or death.

==Osby trial==
&quot;State v. Kelly&quot; (1984), by allowing testimony on battered woman syndrome, opened the door to considering the subjective state of the perpetrator as a pathological syndrome caused by environmental factors and allowing a defense on those grounds.

The term &quot;urban survival syndrome&quot; was first used in 1994 in a Fort Worth, Texas murder case in which two defense attorneys, David Bays and Bill Lane, defended Daimion Osby, their 17-year-old black client, who had shot and killed two unarmed men in a parking lot and was on trial on two counts of first degree murder. The victims were also black, and the defendant told the police he shot them because he was in fear for his life and had to kill them before they killed him. The attorneys argued that Osby had reason to be fearful because he lived in a dangerous community, an inner city neighborhood with one of the highest crime rates in the country. Expert testimony was allowed into evidence, provided by a sociologist, Jared Taylor, who had written on race relations and who produced statistics that the Fort Worth area where the crime took place was a dangerous area with a high crime rate, and that the two men who were killed fit the FBI profile of America&#x27;s most dangerous men. Jared Taylor is identified by the Southern Poverty Law center as a white nationalist. He also testified that being killed is the greatest danger facing young men in such neighborhoods. Osby claimed that for the past year the two men had repeatedly harassed and threatened him and his family over the payment of a gambling debt. Evidence was also presented that the two men had a gun in their car.

Based on the testimony, the defense attorneys argued that the defendant&#x27;s belief that he was in danger for his life was reasonable, and therefore he was justified in using lethal force. The jury of nine whites and three blacks deadlocked, eleven to one, in favor of conviction. The prosecutor was a black attorney who forcefully argued that there was no such syndrome in the field of psychiatry as &quot;urban survival syndrome&quot;. The one holdout was a black man from the same neighborhood as Osby and who agreed that the area was a &quot;war zone&quot;. Six jury members interviewed after the trial said they disregarded the defense as far-fetched. Further, a coalition of black ministers from Osby&#x27;s neighborhood publicly disavowed that the neighborhood was so dangerous and complained that the defense reinforced racial stereotypes. 

Upon retrial on the murder charges, the defense attempted to introduce testimony from a psychologist, in addition to that of the sociologist, on the psychological effects of living in a violent urban area. The psychologist&#x27;s testimony was disallowed and Osby was convicted on the two murder counts and sentenced to serve life in prison.

==Criticisms==
The &quot;urban survival syndrome&quot; has been criticized by black people as a stereotype as if all black people react in the same way: that as a group black people are violent, angry and more than likely guilty. This perspective demonstrated the flaw in any defense that depends on the rules and mores of a subculture as a replacement for those of the dominant society. Fort Worth minister Ralph Waldo Emerson stated:
The battered woman syndrome has been criticized on similar grounds: that it encourages the societal stereotype of women as helpless and incapacitated. While the court testimony can support the woman&#x27;s actions as reasonable under the circumstances as self-defense, the courts seem to focus on testimony that portray the battered woman as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. Further problems arise with this defense when an analogous syndrome, the &quot;battered child syndrome&quot; is used as a defense, as the unique susceptibility of a woman to domestic violence can seem to be undercut.

<text>Daniel Lytle Dolan (28 May 1951 – 26 April 2022) was an American traditionalist Catholic bishop.

==Biography==
===Priesthood===
Lefebvre directed the Seminary of Saint Pius X&#x27;s American priests to follow the 1962 liturgical books. Dolan and eight other American priests refused to do these. On 27 April 1983, these nine priests, along with some seminarians who were sympathetic to them, were promptly expelled from the SSPX by Lefebvre, for their refusal to use the 1962 Missal and for other reasons, such as their resistance to Lefebvre&#x27;s order that priests of the SSPX must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals, and their disapproval of the SSPX&#x27;s policy of accepting into the society new members who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of Paul VI. Almost immediately, these priests formed the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV).

===Episcopacy===

On 30 November 1993, in Saint Gertrude the Great Church, West Chester, Pivarunas consecrated Dolan a bishop.

On 11 May 1999, in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, Dolan assisted as the co-consecrator in Pivarunas&#x27; episcopal consecration of Father Martín Dávila Gandara of the &quot;Sociedad Sacerdotal Trento&quot; (Priestly Union of Trent).

On 22 February 2018, in Brooksville, Florida, United States, Dolan assisted as a co-consecrator in Bishop Donald Sanborn&#x27;s episcopal consecration of Father Joseph Selway of the Roman Catholic Institute.

On 29 September 2021, Dolan consecrated Brazilian Father Rodrigo da Silva, a former priest of the SSPX-Resistance, as a bishop for Mexico and South America.

On 26 April 2022, Father Stephen McKenna of Saint Gertrude the Great Church announced the sudden death of Bishop Dolan on the same day.

Bishop Dolan and Fr Joseph Collins were instrumental in converting Ohio State Death Row inmate Joseph Murphy to Roman Catholicism. Dolan Baptized and confirmed Murphy after a period of religious instruction and corresponded and regularly conferred sacraments upon Joseph Murphy.

<text>iTunes Store is a digital marketplace selling songs, albums, music videos, ringtones and alert tones. It was launched by Apple Inc. on April 28, 2003 for Mac OS X, and on October 16, 2003 for Microsoft Windows. It launched as a mobile application with iOS on June 29, 2007.

It previously sold mobile applications until the launch of the App Store on July 10, 2008, and e-books until the launch of the iBooks Store on March 31, 2010. It also used to facilitate the downloading of podcasts which later became integrated into Apple Podcasts, as well as the provision to buy and rent films and TV shows which has since become integrated into Apple TV.

The iTunes Store opened as part of then-CEO Steve Jobs&#x27; push to open a digital marketplace for music. When it launched, it was the only legal digital catalog of music to offer songs from all five major record labels, which played a part in its success and influenced the music downloading business. Music streaming services began to overtake music downloading, with Apple launching Apple Music on June 30, 2015.

==History==
Steve Jobs saw the opportunity to open a digital marketplace for music due to the rising popularity of easily downloadable tracks. In 2002, Jobs made an agreement with the five major record labels to offer their content through iTunes. The iTunes Music Store (later iTunes Store) was introduced by Jobs at a special Apple music event in April 2003. Music could be purchased in the iTunes application, and purchases were playable in iTunes or on the iPod. The store was initially available to Mac computers, and was later expanded to Microsoft Windows in October 2003 when iTunes for Windows was launched.

In April 2008, the iTunes Store was the largest music vendor in the United States, and in February 2010, it was the largest music vendor in the world. The iTunes Store&#x27;s revenues in the first quarter of 2011 totaled nearly US$1.4 billion. By May 28, 2014, the store had sold 35 billion songs worldwide.

In 2016, it was reported that music streaming services had overtaken digital downloads in sales. It was reported that iTunes-style digital download sales had dropped 24% as streaming continued to increase.

In April 2018, the iTunes app was added to the Microsoft Windows 10 app store. Beginning in the spring of 2019, the iTunes app became available on Samsung Smart TVs.

In October 2019, with the release of macOS Catalina, iTunes was split into separate Music, TV, and Podcasts apps. Apple&#x27;s storefront for movies and television shows moved inside the TV app. Any music in users&#x27; iTunes library would transfer to the Music app, which would still offer access to the iTunes Store.

==Features and restrictions==

=== Current availability ===
The iTunes Store is available on most Apple devices, including the Mac (inside the Music app), the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod touch, and the Apple TV, as well as on Windows (inside iTunes). Video purchases from the iTunes Store are viewable on the Apple TV app on Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices and certain smart televisions. Unlike other Apple media services such as Apple Music or Apple TV+, there is no web-based interface for the iTunes Store with the exception of limited iTunes Preview pages; the desktop application has to be installed to browse the store. While initially a dominant player in digital media, by the mid-2010s, streaming media services were generating more revenue than the buy-to-own model used by the iTunes Store. 

Currently, iTunes is supported on the macOS (Leopard and above) and Microsoft Windows operating systems. iTunes was known to run passably well in Linux on x86-based computers using the Wine compatibility layer; however, by December 2011, this was no longer the case. Users without iTunes installed can see a content database (but not hear or view the content itself) using the iTunes Preview service, which runs inside a web browser. This service also allows users to watch trailers for upcoming film releases. Should they choose to purchase any media, they will be redirected to iTunes.

===Pricing model===
====History====
Following the introduction of the iTunes Store, individual songs were all sold for the same price, though Apple introduced multiple prices in 2007. Music in the store is in the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format, which is the MPEG-4-specified successor to MP3. Originally, songs were only available with DRM and were encoded at . At the January 2009 Macworld Expo, Apple announced that all iTunes music would be made available without DRM, and encoded at the higher-quality rate of . Previously, this model, known as &quot;iTunes Plus&quot;, had been available only for music from EMI and some independent labels. Users can sample songs by listening to previews, ninety seconds in length, or thirty seconds for short tracks.

In addition, the iTunes Store offers apps, which are applications used for various purposes (games, productivity, news, etc.) that are compatible with the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad, although some apps are specifically for the iPhone or iPad only. Some apps cost money (called &quot;Paid Apps&quot;) and some are free (called &quot;Free Apps&quot;). Developers can decide which prices they want to charge for apps, from a pre-set list of pricing tiers, from free to several hundred dollars. When someone downloads an App, 70 percent of the purchase goes to the developer(s), and 30 percent goes to Apple.

At the Macworld 2008 keynote, Steve Jobs, who was Apple&#x27;s CEO at the time, announced iTunes movie rentals. Movies are available for rent in the iTunes Store on the same day they are released on DVD, though the iTunes Store also offers for rental some movies that are still in theaters. Movie rentals are only viewable for 24 hours (in the US) or 48 hours (in other countries) after users begin viewing them. The iTunes Store also offers one low-priced movie rental a week: in the United States, this rental costs 99 cents. Movie rentals are still not available in all countries but they are available in many countries including the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand.

There is a weekly promotion in which one to three songs are available to download for free to logged-in users. Free downloads are available on Tuesdays, and remain free until the following Tuesday, when the store gets refreshed with new content. Some artists choose to have select songs available for no charge. This is not available at all iTunes Stores. Some iTunes television programs have begun the same technique to encourage brand loyalty, although those stay longer. In fact, the iTunes Store has a &quot;Free TV Episodes&quot; page where free episodes are organized by length, either as &quot;featurettes&quot; (shorter than 15 minutes) or full-length episodes (longer than 15 minutes). Free content can vary from a preview of a show to bonus content to pilot episodes and entire seasons of TV shows (examples of free seasons include HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Weight of the Nation&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Pan-Am&quot;). Some networks, such as ABC and NBC, have their own pages of &quot;Free Season Premieres&quot;.

While previously the US iTunes Store has offered as many as three free songs each week (the single of the week, Discovery Download, and Canción de la Semana) in recent years, the store has instead replaced the three aforementioned categories with a unified &quot;Single of the Week&quot; banner, with the week&#x27;s single being from a new up-and-coming artist. In 2015, Apple discontinued the &quot;Single of the Week&quot; program.

=====Apps=====
App prices are set by the developer; they can be free of charge or charged at 99 cents plus any number of dollars.

===iTunes Store for iOS===
The iTunes Store allows users to purchase and download items directly to portable Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and iPod Touch. Apple offers three apps, each of which provides access to certain types of content.

* The App Store app sells apps for iOS, and also provides updates to these apps.
* The iTunes Store app sells music and videos.
* The Apple Books app sells ebooks.

Other, free content available from the iTunes Store can be accessed from two other iOS apps:

* The Podcasts apps lets users download, subscribe to and sync podcasts.
* The iTunes U app gives access to iTunes U educational material.

Originally, mobile users had to be connected to a Wi-Fi network in order to enter the store, hence its original name: &quot;iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store&quot;. However, at Macworld 2009, Apple issued a software update which automatically allowed 3G and EDGE users to access the store&#x27;s full functionality for files smaller than 10 megabytes (MB). The iOS 3.0 update added the ability to download movies, TV shows, audiobooks, iTunes U, and ringtones on mobile devices, in addition to the previously available songs and podcasts. On February 18, 2010, Apple increased the 10 MB 3G download limit to 20 MB. In March 2012, Apple increased the 3G download limit to 50 MB, and, in late 2013, Apple increased the limit to 100 MB when they released the final version of iOS 7 for their new iPhones.

===Customer support===
In the United States, Apple provides technical support for the iTunes Store via email; there is no phone number for issues with iTunes purchases. Most customer service inquiries are handled online, via the Report a Problem link in iTunes.

===Charitable donations===
In response to major natural disasters, Apple provides the facility for donations to be made through the iTunes Store. Unlike other iTunes purchases, donations made to charitable organizations through this system are not subject to the 30% handling fee Apple usually charges. iTunes donation pages were set up following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In all of these cases, donations were redirected to the Red Cross.

===Music===
The store began operations after Apple signed deals with five major record companies: EMI, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Bertelsmann Music Group. Songs from more than 2,000 independent labels were added later, the first being from The Orchard on June 24, 2003.

, iTunes offers 60 million songs, including exclusive tracks from numerous artists. Not all artists are available on iTunes, but many holdouts, such as Led Zeppelin and Radiohead, have allowed their music to be sold on the iTunes Store in recent years. The iTunes Store is updated each Tuesday.

Downloaded songs come with song information (name, artist, album) already filled out, though iTunes provides a free service by Gracenote to do this for songs not purchased from the store, although they must be imported with iTunes. Songs that have an entry in the iTunes Store also come with album artwork (Artwork is embedded in the metadata). Artwork can be obtained for songs not purchased from the store for free if the user has an iTunes Store account. Purchased songs do not come with lyrics, nor does iTunes provide a service for acquiring the missing lyrics. 

Some albums purchased on iTunes come with booklets. The first instance of this was the release of the album &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; by rock band U2.

====&quot;Album Only&quot; songs====
Some songs are available from the store by &quot;Album Only&quot;, meaning the song can only be acquired through the purchase of the entire album, whereas most songs can be downloaded separately from the album they belong to.

Songs above 10 minutes in length are by default Album Only songs. However, this is not universally true; for example, &quot;Living in the Heart of the Beast&quot; by Henry Cow is 16 minutes and 18 seconds, yet is available for individual purchase . Soundtracks also often have many Album Only tracks.

Movie soundtracks normally include songs owned by many different labels, making licensing more complex. For example, &quot;Forrest Gump: The Soundtrack&quot; includes songs from Peacock Records, Argo Records, and Capitol Records, among many others. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; by Red Hot Chili Peppers has only one song, &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, that is not available for download on a per song basis, whilst &quot;Circus&quot; (Britney Spears&#x27; 2008 album) has two songs that are available for album download only, &quot;Rock Me In&quot; and &quot;Phonography&quot;.

==== Partial Albums ====
Some albums on the iTunes store are available only as a &quot;Partial Album&quot; meaning that one or more of the songs on an album&#x27;s CD release are not available on its iTunes equivalent, often due to differing copyright holders between songs.

====&quot;Work Only&quot; songs====
Some tracks are listed as &quot;Work Only&quot;, which means they can only be obtained by purchasing the entire piece of work (within the album); the tracks cannot be bought as singles. Works are generally pieces of classical music: symphonies, string quartets, etc., in multiple movements.

====&quot;LP&quot; format====
In September 2009, Apple introduced the iTunes LP format (known pre-launch by the code name &quot;Cocktail&quot;) which features visual, interactive content alongside album tracks and lyrics.

====Store sections====

When entering the US music store, there are multiple sections one can visit. Music is divided into genres (Alternative, Classical, Jazz, Soundtrack, etc.), and there are a number of links to other sections of the store under the Quick Links header. These include Recommended for You, Complete My Album, iTunes LP, as well as thematic sections, such as iTunes Festival sections.

In November 2006, Apple created a category for Latino and Hispanic content, &quot;iTunes Latino&quot;. Telemundo and Mun2 made some of their popular programs available for purchase, becoming the first Hispanic television content in the store. It offers music, music videos, audiobooks, podcasts and television shows in Spanish in a single concentrated area. The brief descriptions given to the content are in Spanish as well as several subcategories. Gibraltarian flamenco metal band Breed 77 released an exclusive album called Un Encuentro to coincide with the launch of &quot;iTunes Latino&quot;. It features 11 songs, all from previous albums, but all sung in Spanish.

In 2012, Apple created Mastered for iTunes. When iTunes launched, the decision was made to standardize on AAC instead of the more popular MP3 format on the supposition that it offers better quality compared to other codecs at similar bit rates. Mastered for iTunes (MFiT) is a procedure developed by Apple specifically for mastering engineers to follow. This set of tools allows engineers to audition Apple&#x27;s proprietary encoding during the mastering process to take into account how music will eventually interact with Apple&#x27;s encoding. In addition to auditioning the encoder, there is also a tool (called afclip) that processes the audio file and creates a text file for audio clips. Because of this special encoding process, extra attention must be paid to headroom and inter-sample peaking while mastering. In August 2019, it was announced that the Mastered for iTunes program would be rebranded as Apple Digital Masters. With the rebranding, the high resolution masters are now available with Apple Music through streaming. It is speculated that the rebranding came because the functionality of iTunes would be changing in macOS Catalina and therefore the Mastered for iTunes name no longer made sense.

==Censorship==
There is a policy of censoring profanity in titles on iTunes. This has resulted in a Scunthorpe glitch, by which inoffensive titles are censored due to a coincidental string of letters. If the song has an explicit label, it will be marked &quot;explicit&quot; next to the song title. If a song is marked &quot;explicit&quot; it is unavailable for purchase if &quot;restrict explicit content&quot; is checked under the parental controls preference. Often there will be a &quot;clean&quot; mark next to the title of some songs, meaning the lyrics have been censored, and is available to purchase on all accounts. Generally if a song is marked &quot;clean&quot; there is an explicit version available as well.

==Reception and commercial success==

In the first 18 hours, the iTunes store sold about 275,000 tracks, and more than 1 million tracks were sold in its first 5 days. When it was released on Windows in October 2003, the iTunes program was downloaded more than 1 million times in the first 3 days, selling more than 1 million songs in that period. On December 15, 2003, Apple announced that it had sold 25 million songs.

In January 2004 at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced (Sellers, 2004) that an unnamed person had purchased US$29,500 worth of music. On March 15, 2004, Apple announced that iTunes Music Store customers had purchased and downloaded 50 million songs from iTunes Music Store. They also reported that customers were purchasing 2.5 million songs a week which translates to a projected annual run rate of 130 million songs a year. The 50 millionth song was &quot;The Path of Thorns&quot; by Sarah McLachlan.

On April 28, 2004, iTunes Music Store marked its first anniversary with 70 million songs sold, clear dominance in the paid online music market and a slight profit. The store also offers hundreds of movie trailers and music videos, in an attempt to boost soundtrack sales. In the conference, Steve Jobs reiterated that a subscription service is still not in the interest of customers and reported that only 5 million of the 100 million songs offered in the Pepsi giveaway campaign were redeemed, which he blamed on technical problems in Pepsi distribution. According to an Apple press release dated August 10, 2004, iTunes Music Store was the first store to have a catalog of more than one million songs. Also, iTunes Music Store at that point maintained a 70 percent market share of legal music downloads.

The emerging monopoly of the store was criticized in 2011 by Mike Lang of Miramax for &quot;effectively strangling the industry&quot;. He says that because the music industry has allowed too few content providers, it is now suffering. Lang views the issue as being more of a threat than music piracy.

==Internationalization==
Originally only Mac OS X users who had a US billing address could buy songs with the service, but Steve Jobs announced plans to support both Windows and non-American users. The Windows version of iTunes and support for the Windows platform from iTunes Music Store were announced on October 16, 2003, with immediate availability. Beginning in 2004, the service became available in a number of countries other than the United States:

To buy files through the store, a user must install the proprietary digital media player iTunes to access the store. This software is available only for certain versions of the Macintosh or Windows operating systems.

*According to an Apple press release, the European iTunes Music Stores sold a combined total of 800,000 songs in one week, with 450,000 of those songs sold in the UK.
*The Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Greek stores have been localized.
*On December 3, 2004, the British Office of Fair Trading referred iTunes Music Store to the European Commission because it prevents consumers in one EU country from buying music from stores in other EU countries, in violation of EU free-trade legislation; the immediate cause of the referral was because the €0.99 price charged in the Eurozone equates to £0.68 in sterling, rather than the £0.79 actually charged there.
*iTunes Music Store in Japan had 1 million songs available at start. In the next four days the store had sold one million songs – the pace faster than that of the US store. In addition to a long delay, Apple failed to have one set price for singles. Pundits speculated that this may have indicated the introduction of new price structure to the rest of the stores in future, in favor of record labels who would like to see higher prices for new songs. This extension to other countries was announced in January 2009.
*The release of video-capable iPods also saw the store launch in Australia with music videos and short films by Pixar. iTunes Gift Cards (as they are now known) are now also available in many more stores such as JB Hi-Fi, David Jones, and the Woolworths chain of stores. Access was inadvertently given to some people in New Zealand, too. Failed negotiations with the Sony BMG label meant that none of that label&#x27;s artists were available at the time of launch; they were later added on January 17, 2006.
*New Zealand users had briefly been able to buy from the Australian store when it first opened until that loophole was closed.
*On November 1, 2006, the store started offering a range of Latino content including television shows and music for its Hispanic American, Mexican and Puerto Rican clients.
*The Spanish used on the Mexican store has been modified to Mexican Spanish.
*As of the 2009 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, Apple had given no new information of the (possible; future) inclusion and expansion of music videos, TV-shows and movies in other European countries. The stores of the UK, Germany and France currently remain the only European Stores with local and/or localized selections of TV-shows, movies and music videos.

Residents in other countries can only buy a gift card from a merchant or download free podcasts and previews.

==Digital rights management==
In the past, the iTunes Store used Apple&#x27;s FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) technology. FairPlay was built into the MP4 multimedia file format as an encrypted AAC audio layer, and was used by the company to protect copyrighted works sold through the store, allowing only authorized devices to play the content. The restrictions imposed by FairPlay, mainly limited device compatibility, sparked criticism, with a lawsuit alleging antitrust violation that was eventually closed in Apple&#x27;s favor, and various successful efforts to remove the DRM protection from files, with Apple continually updating its software to counteract such projects.

In February 2007, an open letter by Steve Jobs, Apple&#x27;s CEO, discussed the use of DRM on music, raising points about the future of the protection and announced the company&#x27;s support for ending the use of DRM. Although the open letter initially caused mixed industry reactions, Apple signed a deal with EMI, a record label, the following month in order to offer iTunes customers a purchase option called &quot;iTunes Plus&quot;, for a higher-quality, DRM-free version of all of EMI&#x27;s tracks. In January 2009, Apple signed deals with all major record labels as well as a large number of independent labels in order to begin to offer most iTunes music DRM-free. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM had been removed from 80% of its music catalog in the US. Full DRM-free &quot;iTunes Plus&quot; music availability was achieved in the US on April 7, 2009, coinciding with the introduction of a three-tiered pricing model. This does not apply to songs downloaded using Apple Music, Apple&#x27;s subscription-based music streaming service. Television episodes, many books, and films are still &quot;FairPlay&quot; DRM-protected.

==Promotions==
On Super Bowl Sunday, February 1, 2004, Apple launched a promotion with Pepsi in which they gave away 100 million songs, through tokens on selected soft drink bottle caps. Unfortunately for Apple, Pepsi failed to properly distribute the bottles to major metropolitan areas until only weeks before the promotion ended, despite a one-month extension of the deadline by Apple. The promotion was repeated beginning January 31, 2005, with 200 million songs available, and an iPod Mini given away every hour.

On July 1, 2004, Apple announced that, starting with the sale of the 95 millionth song, an iPod would be given away to the buyer of each 100 thousandth song, for a total of 50 iPods. The buyer of the 100 millionth song would receive a PowerBook, iPod, and US$10,000 gift certificate to iTunes Music Store.

Ten days later, on July 11, Apple announced that 100 million songs had been sold through iTunes Music Store. The 100 millionth song was titled &quot;Somersault (Dangermouse Remix)&quot; by Zero 7, purchased by Kevin Britten of Hays, Kansas. He then received a phone call from Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who offered his congratulations, as well as a 40 GB 3rd Generation iPod laser-engraved with a message of thanks.

Inspired by Pepsi&#x27;s marketing success with iTunes giveaways, Coca-Cola partnered with 7-Eleven to give away a free iTunes song with every . Slurpee frozen beverage until July 31, 2005. Songs could be redeemed until August 31, 2005, by entering a code printed on the Slurpee cup into iTunes Music Store application. Coca-Cola did this in spite of having its own music store, myCokeMusic.com, that competed with iTunes Music Store in Europe. myCokeMusic.com ceased business on July 31, 2006.

On July 5, 2005, Apple announced that they were counting down to half a billion songs. The buyer of every 100 thousandth song up to 500 million would receive an iPod Mini and a 50-song gift card. The grand prize for the person who downloads the 500 millionth song was 10 iPods of their choice, a 10,000-song gift card, 10 50-song gift cards or 4 tickets to the Coldplay world tour. Twelve days later, on July 17, Apple announced that 500 million songs had been sold through iTunes Music Store. The 500 millionth song, purchased by Amy Greer of Lafayette, Indiana, was &quot;Mississippi Girl&quot; by Faith Hill.

On July 28, 2005, Apple and The Gap announced a promotion to award iTunes music downloads to Gap customers who tried on a pair of Gap jeans. From August 8 to 31, 2005, each customer who tried on any pair of Gap jeans could receive a free download for a song of their choice from iTunes Music Store.

On February 7, 2006, Apple announced that they were counting down to the billionth song download and began a promotion similar to the previous 100 million and 500 million countdown. Whoever downloaded the billionth song would receive a 20&quot; iMac, ten 60 GB iPods, and a US$10,000 iTunes Music Card. The billionth song was purchased on February 23, 2006, by Alex Ostrovsky of West Bloomfield, Michigan. The purchased song was &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; as part of Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; album.

On July 25, 2006, Facebook and iTunes began offering a promotion where members of the Apple Students group would receive a free 25 song sampler each week until September 30 in various music genres. The idea behind the promotion was to get students more familiar and enthusiastic with each service as Autumn classes approached. However, in order to prevent abuse of the promotion, the weekly code that Facebook provided stopped working after it was redeemed one million times. In addition, the promotion caused discontent among international students, as the code was only valid in the US iTunes Music Store.

On April 10, 2009, Apple announced that it will be counting down to the billionth app (apps being the applications for iPod Touch and iPhone). Apple launched a continuous counter to the billionth app on Good Friday. Connor Mulcahey, age 13 of Weston, CT, downloaded the billionth app, &quot;Bump&quot; by Bump Technologies, and received a 17&quot; MacBook Pro, a 32GB iPod Touch, a Time Capsule, and a $10,000 Gift Card for the iTunes Store.

On February 11, 2010, Apple announced that it would be counting down to 10 billion songs downloaded. A $10,000 gift card was offered as a prize. On February 24, 2010, the 10 billionth song, &quot;Guess Things Happen That Way&quot; by Johnny Cash, was purchased by Louie Sulcer of Woodstock, Georgia.

==Technical details==
Store pages are delivered using standard HTML with a special header. This change was made when iTunes 9.0 was released. iTunes uses WebKit to render these pages on the screen. These pages are also accessible on the Web, at iTunes.apple.com, allowing pages from the iTunes Store to show up in search engine search results.

Prior to iTunes 9.0, the iTunes Store was delivered using a custom XML format that describes the position of all of the elements, boxes, album art and all of their properties – including whether a reference link can be dragged out of iTunes and into another document.

The store&#x27;s back-end software uses WebObjects – Apple&#x27;s own application server it acquired from NeXT. Content is uploaded to iTunes data store using an internal Apple program called iTunes Producer, which automatically encodes and adds metadata to uploaded files.

Apple has created its own lossless audio compression technology, known as Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC). Alongside AAC, the entire Apple Music catalog is now also encoded with ALAC, offering resolutions from 16-bit/44.1 kHz (CD Quality) up to 24-bit/192 kHz. 

Artists and record labels can upload music using Apple’s proprietary mastering format, Apple Digital Masters, which encourages mastering engineers to provide high-resolution, 24-bit audio files for optimal sound quality.

==Legal disputes==
===Apple records===

For three years, The Beatles&#x27; record company Apple Records were in a legal dispute, &quot;Apple Corps v Apple Computer&quot;, with Apple Computer over the name &quot;Apple.&quot; On May 8, 2006, a ruling was declared in favor of Apple Computer, but Apple Records said it would appeal the ruling. Despite this, plans were announced by Neil Aspinall in April 2006 to remaster completely and release the entire Beatles catalog on an unspecified online music service, as well as release some previously unheard work by the band. No date was set at that time. It has also been reported that the Beatles&#x27; music catalog might initially be appearing on iTunes only, as Apple is reported to be negotiating with Britain&#x27;s EMI group over an online distribution deal that might be exclusive for a limited time.

During his Macworld Keynote address on January 9, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs used the band&#x27;s song &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends,&quot; followed by &quot;Lovely Rita,&quot; to introduce the music-playing capabilities of the company&#x27;s new iPhone. This was regarded by industry observers as further evidence that the Beatles catalog would be introduced to iTunes Music Store catalog in the near future. On February 5, 2007, Apple Corps and Apple Inc. announced they had reached a settlement in their legal dispute.

In a related development, Apple announced on August 14, 2007, that the entire solo catalog of John Lennon would be available on iTunes. The solo catalogs of the other three Beatles, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison, are also available on iTunes.

On November 16, 2010, the entire Beatles catalog was officially made available on the iTunes Store.

===The Consumer Council of Norway EULA challenge===
On June 6, 2006, The Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway, Sweden and Denmark launched a common open letter to Apple regarding the EULA of iTunes through the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bjørn Erik Thon. The iTunes case is based upon an official complaint filed by The Consumer Council of Norway on January 25, 2006.

The main allegations were that:

*The EULA is unbalanced to disfavor the customer. Scandinavian law requires any written agreement to favor both parties. The weak party also enjoys protection from exploitation according to Norwegian consumer laws.
*The iTunes Store&#x27;s use of Digital rights management limits the number of devices purchased songs can be played on.
*iTunes&#x27; contract entitles the company to at any time change the terms of the contract without notice, including the selection of players or software that must be used for iTunes files, and also the number of times a customer can change or copy already purchased files.
*The EULA is both vague and hard to understand for the customers.
*The EULA states that the legal relationship between the company and customers is regulated by English contract law. It is unreasonable to expect Norwegian consumers to have comprehensive knowledge of English law. Products marketed to Norwegian consumers in Norway are subject to Norwegian law—a right that cannot be waived by a clause in a company&#x27;s standard customer contract.
*The EULA removes iTunes&#x27; responsibility regarding damage to the consumer&#x27;s computer caused by software errors even though responsibility cannot be waived in Scandinavian Law.

Apple responded July 31, 2006.

On January 22, 2007, German and French consumer groups joined forces with Norway and Finland. Their goal is to create a united European front against iTunes (Germany and France have each had their own negotiation process with iTunes). According to the press statement Apple is in favor of this. The key points in the negotiations were:

*Interoperability: the consumer should have the right and ability to play his or her music on any device of his or her own choice.
*Change of conditions: iTunes must revoke their right to change the terms and conditions (EULA) at any time without the consent of the consumer.
*Liability: iTunes should change its clause limiting its liability to recover consumer damages if they are caused by content sold by iTunes.
*Applicable Law: Consumers entering into a contract with iTunes should be able to rely on the consumer protection rules according to the law of the country in which they live.

====EU antitrust case====
In 2004, &quot;Which?&quot; magazine complained to the European Commission about the higher prices in the UK for the same songs sold in other parts of the European Union: typically €0.99 in the rest of the EU and £0.79 in the UK. In 2008, the Commission withdrew its investigation after Apple agreed to end the price disparity.

==Content disputes==

===Universal Music Group===

On July 1, 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Universal (the world&#x27;s largest music corporation at the time of writing) would not renew its annual contract to sell music through iTunes. Instead, Universal said that it would market music to Apple at will, allowing it to remove its songs from the iTunes service on short notice if the two sides did not agree on pricing or other terms.

On August 9, 2007, UMG announced a plan to sell some songs in MP3 format, without Digital rights management, through a variety of online services such as Amazon Music and the newly created gBox. While these tracks continue to be available through the iTunes Store, Universal chose to license these songs in DRM-free formats only through other services.

===NBC Universal TV series===
On August 31, 2007, Apple announced that programs on NBC&#x27;s 2007–08 television schedule would not be available on iTunes. NBC had informed Apple the previous day that it would not be renewing its contract. It was later clarified that this change only applied to series produced by NBCUniversal-owned Universal Television, including Universal-produced shows on other networks such as &quot;House&quot;. NBC programs produced by other studios, such as &quot;Chuck&quot; (Warner Bros.) and &quot;Journeyman&quot; (20th Century Fox), would remain available on iTunes.

Apple has publicly asserted that NBC would only renew their contract if Apple agreed to a price increase of per episode, which they did not. NBC disputes that claim, claiming that Apple balked at NBC&#x27;s request to package shows together and make wholesale pricing more flexible. NBC claims that they never asked to double the wholesale price and insisted that their shows would be sold by the iTunes Store through early December. Other networks who sold their shows via iTunes did not follow suit. On December 1, 2007, NBC shows were pulled from the iTunes Store.

On September 9, 2008, Apple and NBC Universal announced that NBC&#x27;s TV shows were once again available on the US iTunes Store.

The UK iTunes Store has many shows from NBC available, although they are distributed by Universal Studios. The pricing for these seasons are higher than they were on the US store, an example being, Season 3 of The Office is priced at vs. (US Store HD).

<doc id="218235" wikidata="Q335187" url="?curid=218235" title="Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon">
<text>Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon (25 April 1862 – 7 September 1933), better known as Sir Edward Grey, was a British statesman and Liberal Party politician who was the main force behind British foreign policy in the era of the First World War.

An adherent of the &quot;New Liberalism&quot;, he served as Foreign Secretary from 1905 to 1916, the longest continuous tenure of any holder of that office. He renewed the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1911. The centrepiece of his policy was the defence of France against German aggression, while avoiding a binding alliance with Paris. He supported France in the Moroccan crises of 1905 and 1911. Another major achievement was the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. He resolved an outstanding conflict with Germany over the Baghdad railway in 1913. His most important action came in the July Crisis in 1914, when he led Britain into World War I against Germany. He convinced the Liberal cabinet that Britain had an obligation and was honour-bound to defend France, and prevent Germany from controlling Western Europe. Once the war began, there was little role for his diplomacy; he lost office in December 1916. By 1919 he was a leading British supporter of the League of Nations.

He is remembered for his &quot;the lamps are going out&quot; remark on 3 August 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War. He signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement on 16 May 1916. He was ennobled in 1916, prior to which he was the 3rd Baronet Grey of Fallodon, and was Ambassador to the United States between 1919 and 1920 and Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords between 1923 and 1924.

==Background, education and early life==
Grey was the eldest of the seven children of Colonel George Henry Grey and Harriet Jane Pearson, daughter of Charles Pearson. His grandfather Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet of Fallodon, was also a prominent Liberal politician, while his great-grandfather Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet of Fallodon, was the third son of Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey, and the younger brother of Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey. He was also a cousin of two later British Foreign Secretaries: Anthony Eden and Lord Halifax. Grey attended Temple Grove School from 1873 until 1876. His father died unexpectedly in December 1874, and his grandfather assumed responsibility for his education, sending him to Winchester College.

Grey went on to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1880 to read Literae Humaniores. Apparently an indolent student, he was tutored by Mandell Creighton during the vacations and managed a second class in Honour Moderations. He subsequently became more idle, using his time to become university champion at real tennis. In 1882 his grandfather died and he inherited a baronet&#x27;s title, an estate of about , and a private income. Returning to Oxford in the autumn of 1883, Grey switched to studying jurisprudence (law) in the belief that it would be an easier option, but by January 1884 he had been sent down but allowed to return to sit his final examination. Grey returned in the summer and achieved Third Class honours in Jurisprudence. Though he was entitled to receive a BA, he never received one. He would receive an honorary doctorate of law from Oxford in 1907. 

Grey left university with no clear career plan and in the summer of 1884 he asked a neighbour and relative, Lord Northbrook, at the time First Lord of the Admiralty, to find him &quot;serious and unpaid employment.&quot; Northbrook recommended him as a private secretary to his kinsman Sir Evelyn Baring, the British consul general to Egypt, who was attending a conference in London. Grey had shown no particular interest in politics whilst at university, but by the summer of 1884 Northbrook found him &quot;very keen on politics,&quot; and after the Egyptian conference had ended found him a position as an unpaid assistant private secretary to Hugh Childers, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

In 1898 Grey became a director of the North Eastern Railway, later becoming Chairman (1904-5; curtailed by his appointment as Foreign Secretary). In &quot;Twenty-Five Years&quot; (see Works, below) Grey later wrote that &#x27;…the year 1905 was one of the happiest of my life; the work of Chairman of the Railway was agreeable and interesting…&#x27;. After leaving the Foreign Office Grey resumed his directorship of the NER in 1917, and when the North Eastern Railway became part of the London and North Eastern Railway he became a director of that company, remaining in this position until 1933. At the Railway Centenary celebrations in July 1925, Grey accompanied the Duke and Duchess of York and presented them with silver models of the engine &quot;Locomotion&quot; and the passenger carriage &quot;Experiment&quot;.

Two of Grey&#x27;s brothers were killed by wild animals in Africa: George was mauled by a lion in 1911, and Charles was felled by a buffalo in 1928. His other brother, Alexander, was a vicar in Trinidad and died there aged 48 from the after-effects of a childhood cricket injury.

==Early political career==
Grey was selected as the Liberal Party candidate for Berwick-upon-Tweed where his Conservative opponent was Earl Percy. He was duly elected in November 1885 and, at 23, became the youngest MP (Baby of the House) in the new House of Commons. He was not called in the Home Rule debate, but was nonetheless convinced by William Ewart Gladstone and John Morley of the rightness of the cause. A year later Grey summoned up the courage to make a maiden speech, at a similar period to Asquith. During the debate over the 1888 Land Purchase Bill he began &quot;an association and friendship&quot; with R. B. Haldane, which was &quot;thus strengthened as years went on&quot;. The nascent imperialists voted against &quot;this passing exception&quot;. On a previous occasion he had met Neville Lyttelton, later a knight and general, who would become his closest friend.

Grey retained his seat in the 1892 election with a majority of 442 votes and to his surprise was made Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by Gladstone (albeit after his son Herbert had refused the post) under the Foreign Secretary, Lord Rosebery. Grey would later claim that at this point he had had no special training nor paid special attention to foreign affairs. The new Under-Secretary prepared the policy for making Uganda a new colony, proposing to build a railway from Cairo through East Africa, through later limiting government funds being used to build it. There was continuity in presentation and preparation during the Scramble for Africa; foreign policy was not an election issue. The Liberals continued to incline towards the Triple Alliance, causing the press to write of a &quot;Quadruple Alliance&quot;.

Grey later dated his first suspicions of future Anglo-German disagreements to his early days in office, after Germany had sought commercial concessions from Britain in the Ottoman Empire; in return they would promise support for the British position in Egypt. &quot;It was the abrupt and rough peremptoriness of the German action that gave me an unpleasant impression&quot;; not, he added, that the German position was at all &quot;unreasonable,&quot; rather that the &quot;method... was not that of a friend.&quot; With hindsight, he argued in his autobiography, &quot;the whole policy of the years from 1886 to 1904 [might] be criticized as having played into the hands of Germany.&quot;

===1895 statement on French expansion in Africa===

Prior to the Foreign Office vote on 28 March 1895, Grey asked Lord Kimberley, the new Foreign Secretary, for direction as to how he should answer any question about French activities in West Africa. According to Grey, Kimberley suggested &quot;pretty firm language.&quot; In fact, West Africa was not mentioned, but when pressed on possible French activities in the Nile Valley Grey stated that a French expedition &quot;would be an unfriendly act and would be so viewed by England.&quot; According to Grey the subsequent row both in Paris and in the Cabinet was made worse by the failure of &quot;Hansard&quot; to record that his statement referred explicitly to the Nile Valley and not to Africa in general. The statement was made before the dispatch of the Marchand Mission—indeed, he believed it might have actually provoked it—and as Grey admits did much to damage future Anglo-French relations.

The Liberal Party lost a key vote in the House of Commons on 21 June 1895, and Grey was among the majority in his party that preferred a dissolution to continuing. He seems to have left office with few regrets, noting, &quot;I shall never be in office again and the days of my stay in the House of Commons are probably numbered. We [he and his wife] are both very glad and relieved...&quot; The Liberals were soundly defeated in the subsequent general election, although Grey added 300 votes to his own majority. He was to remain out of office for the next ten years, but was sworn of the Privy Council on 11 August 1902, following an announcement of the King&#x27;s intention to make this appointment in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published in June that year.

He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northumberland in 1901.

==Foreign Secretary 1905–1916==

With the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour divided and unpopular, there was some speculation that H. H. Asquith and his allies Grey and Richard Haldane would refuse to serve in the next Liberal government unless the Liberal leader Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. The plot (called the &quot;Relugas Compact&quot; after the Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Campbell-Bannerman. When Campbell-Bannerman formed a government in December 1905 Grey was appointed Foreign Secretary—the first Foreign Secretary to sit in the Commons since 1868. Haldane became Secretary of State for War. The party won a landslide victory in the 1906 general election. Whilst an MP, he voted in favour of the 1908 Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Bill. When Campbell-Bannerman stepped down as prime minister in 1908, Grey was Asquith&#x27;s only realistic rival to succeed his friend. In any event, Grey continued as Foreign Secretary, and held office for 11 years to the day, the longest continuous tenure in that office.

===Anglo-Russian Entente 1907===

As early as 13 December 1905, Grey had assured the Russian Ambassador Count Alexander Benckendorff that he supported the idea of an agreement with Russia. Negotiations began soon after the arrival of Sir Arthur Nicolson as the new British Ambassador in June 1906. In contrast with the previous Conservative government that had seen Russia as a potential threat to the empire, Grey&#x27;s intention was to re-establish Russia &quot;as a factor in European politics&quot; on the side of France and Great Britain to maintain a balance of power in Europe.

===Agadir Crisis 1911===

Grey did not welcome the prospect of a renewed crisis over Morocco: he worried that it might either lead to a re-opening of the issues covered by the Treaty of Algeciras or that it might drive Spain into alliance with Germany. Initially Grey tried to restrain both France and Spain, but by the spring of 1911 he had failed on both counts. Grey believed that, whether he liked it or not, his hands were tied by the terms of the &quot;Entente cordiale&quot;. The despatch of the German gunboat to Agadir served to strengthen French resolve and, because he was determined both to protect the agreement with France and also to block German attempts at expansion around the Mediterranean, it pushed Grey closer to France. Grey, however, tried to calm the situation, merely commenting on the &quot;abrupt&quot; nature of the German intervention, and insisting that Britain must participate in any discussions about the future of Morocco.

In cabinet on 4 July 1911, Grey accepted that Britain would oppose any German port in the region, any new fortified port anywhere on the Moroccan coast, and that Britain must continue to enjoy an &quot;open door&quot; for its trade with Morocco. Grey at this point was resisting efforts by the Foreign Office to support French intransigence. By the time a second cabinet was held on 21 July, Grey had adopted a tougher position, suggesting that he propose to Germany that a multi-national conference be held, and that were Germany to refuse to participate &quot;we should take steps to assert and protect British interests.&quot;

Grey was made a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1912. Throughout the period leading up to World War Grey played a leading part in negotiations with Kaiser Wilhelm II. He visited Germany and invited their delegation to the Windsor Castle Conference in 1912. They returned several times, with Haldane acting as interpreter.

===July Crisis 1914===

Although Grey&#x27;s activist foreign policy, which relied increasingly on the Triple Entente with France and Russia, came under criticism from the radicals within his own party, he maintained his position because of support from the Conservatives for his &quot;non-partisan&quot; foreign policy. In 1914, Grey played a key role in the July Crisis leading to the outbreak of World War I. His attempts to mediate the dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia were ignored by both sides. On 16 July, Maurice de Bunsen, British ambassador to Austria-Hungary advised that Austria-Hungary regarded the Serbian government as having been complicit in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, and would have to act if Austria-Hungary was not to lose her position as a Great Power. The British Cabinet were preoccupied with the crisis in Ulster, and Grey failed to realize the urgency of the situation, and chose to await further developments.

On 23 July, Austria-Hungary formally handed the Serbian government an ultimatum, which demanded their acceptance, by 25 July, of terms tantamount to Serbia&#x27;s vassalage to Austria-Hungary; it was soon clear that Serbia would accept most of the demands but that Austria-Hungary would settle for nothing less than complete capitulation. On 24 July, the French ambassador in London tried to waken Grey to the realization that once Austrian forces crossed the Serbian border, it would be too late for mediation. Grey responded by urging the German ambassador to attempt a four-power conference of Britain, France, Italy and Germany at Vienna to mediate between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Serbia&#x27;s patron, or at least to obtain an extension of the time-limit set by Austria-Hungary. Grey again proposed a four-power conference on 26 July. He also suggested that Russia and Austria-Hungary should be encouraged to negotiate. The other powers were open to the idea, but Germany, France and Russia were not supporting this.

Following the collapse of Grey&#x27;s four-power talks on Tuesday 28 July, it was clear that war on the continent was now inevitable, although it was not yet certain whether Britain should be involved. Asquith, Grey and Haldane had a late night talk at the Foreign Office. On Wednesday 29 July two decisions were taken at Cabinet. Firstly, the Armed Forces were placed on alert (the &quot;Precautionary Period&quot; was declared and the War Book was opened at 2pm). Secondly, the Cabinet agreed to guarantee the neutrality of Belgium, but that Britain&#x27;s response to any violation of Belgian neutrality would be decided on grounds of policy rather than strict legality. Grey was authorised to tell the German and French ambassadors that Britain had not yet made a decision as to whether or on what terms to join in or stand aside. Besides issues of party management (many Liberal MPs, including at least a third of the Cabinet, and the Liberal press apart from &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;, wanted Britain to stay out), Asquith and Grey genuinely believed that openly backing France and Russia would make them more intransigent, without necessarily deterring Germany. On Friday 31 July Grey had a &quot;rather painful&quot; interview with Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador, at which he resisted Cambon&#x27;s pressure to back France openly.

King George V telegraphed Berlin to confirm that Grey had stated that Britain would remain neutral if France &quot;and Russia&quot; were not attacked. By 31 July, when Grey finally sent a memorandum demanding that Germany respect Belgium&#x27;s neutrality, it was too late. German forces were already massed at the Belgian border, and Helmuth von Moltke convinced Kaiser Wilhelm II it was too late to change the plan of attack.

At a meeting with Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador, early on 1 August, Grey stated the conditions necessary for Britain to remain neutral, but perhaps with a lack of clarity. Grey did not make it clear that Britain would not ignore a breach of the Treaty of London (1839), to respect and protect the neutrality of Belgium. Nor it seems did he make it clear that Britain would support Russia, for at 11:14 AM that morning, Lichnowsky sent a telegram to Berlin which indicated that Grey had proposed that, if Germany were not to attack &quot;France&quot;, Britain would remain neutral. Saturday 1 August saw a difficult Cabinet from 11am to 1.30pm. The Cabinet were divided, but (with the notable exception of Winston Churchill) predominantly against war. Grey threatened to resign if the Cabinet pledged not to intervene in any circumstances. Asquith&#x27;s private preference was to stay out, but he gave Grey staunch support and reckoned he would have to resign if Grey did. Overnight Germany issued an ultimatum to Russia and France. The first of two Cabinets on Sunday 2 August was from 11am to 2pm. After much difficulty it was agreed that Grey should tell Cambon and the Germans that the Royal Navy would not allow the Imperial German Navy to conduct hostile operations in the Channel (the French Navy was concentrated in the Mediterranean, under an Anglo-French naval agreement of 1912).

On Monday 3 August, Germany declared war on France and broke the old London treaty by invading Belgium. That afternoon Grey made an hour-long speech to the House of Commons. As Grey stood at a window in the Foreign Office, watching the lamps being lit as dusk approached on 3 August, he is famously said to have remarked to the editor of &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;, &quot;The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.&quot;

United by the need to assist France as promised, and hold the Liberal party together lest the warmongering Conservatives take power, the Cabinet voted almost unanimously for war, with only John Burns and Viscount Morley resigning. On the afternoon of Tuesday 4 August the House of Commons was informed that an ultimatum had been given to Germany expiring midnight Berlin time (11pm in London). In terms of public appeal, the Liberals made a great deal of German violation of Belgian neutrality, but this was not the main cause for its decision to go to war.

In his memoirs published in 1925 Grey gave his retrospective analysis of the causes of the war:
:More than one true thing may be said about the causes of the war, but the statement that comprises the most truth is that militarism and the armaments inseparable from it made war inevitable...After 1870 Germany had no reason to be afraid, but she fortified herself with armaments and the Triple Alliance in order that she might never have reason to be afraid in the future. France naturally was afraid after 1870, and she made her military preparations and the Dual Alliance (with Russia). Britain, with a very small Army and a very large Empire, became first uncomfortable and then (particularly when Germany began a big-fleet programme) afraid of isolation. She made the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, made up her quarrels with France and Russia, and entered the Entente. Finally, Germany became afraid that she would presently be afraid and struck the blow while she believed her power to be invincible.

Historians studying the July crisis typically conclude that Grey:
:was not a great foreign secretary but an honest, reticent, punctilious English gentleman... He exhibited a judicious understanding of European affairs, a firm control of his staff, and a suppleness and tact in diplomacy, but he had no boldness, no imagination, no ability to command men and events. [Regarding the war] He pursued a cautious, moderate policy, one that not only fitted his temperament, but also reflected the deep split in the Cabinet, in the Liberal party, and in public opinion.

===First World War===

Following the outbreak of World War I, the conduct of British foreign policy was increasingly constrained by the demands of a military struggle beyond Grey&#x27;s control. During the war, Grey worked with the Marquess of Crewe to press an initially reluctant ambassador to the United States, Sir Cecil Spring Rice, to raise the issue of the Hindu–German Conspiracy with the American government; this ultimately led to the unfolding of the entire plot.

In the early years of the war, Grey oversaw negotiation of important secret agreements with new allies (Italy and the Arab rebels) and with France and Russia (the Sykes–Picot Agreement) which, among other provisions, assigned postwar control of the Turkish Straits to Russia. Otherwise, Asquith and Grey generally preferred to avoid discussion of war aims for fear of raising an issue that might fracture the Entente. In a 12 February 1916 paper the new Chief of the Imperial General Staff William Robertson proposed that the Allies offer a separate peace to Turkey, or offer Turkish territory to Bulgaria to encourage Bulgaria to break with the Central Powers and make peace, so as to allow British forces in that theatre to be redeployed against Germany. Grey replied that Britain needed her continental allies more than they needed her, and imperial interests could not incur the risk (e.g., by reneging on the promise that Russia was to have control of the Turkish Straits) that they might choose to make a separate peace, which would leave Germany dominant on the continent.

Grey retained his position as Foreign Secretary when Asquith&#x27;s Coalition Government (which included the Conservatives) was formed in May 1915. Grey was one of those Liberal ministers who contemplated joining Sir John Simon (Home Secretary) in resigning in protest at the conscription of bachelors, due to be enacted in January 1916, but he did not do so. In late 1916 American President Woodrow Wilson secretly promoted a compromise peace to both sides of the war. Both sides rejected the offer. Germany thought that with the defeat of Russia it had enough troops, and new tactics, to win a decisive victory on the Western front . The British cabinet was hostile. Grey was the only senior leader who supported Wilson&#x27;s proposal, but his influence was declining. The best he could do was to soothe Wilson&#x27;s hurt feelings and prevent a possible rupture with Washington.

In an attempt to reduce his workload, he left the House of Commons for the House of Lords in July 1916, accepting a peerage as Viscount Grey of Fallodon, in the County of Northumberland. When Asquith&#x27;s ministry collapsed in December 1916 and David Lloyd George became Prime Minister, Grey went into opposition.

===Later career===

Grey became President of the League of Nations Union in 1918. In 1919 he was appointed Ambassador to the United States, with responsibility for encouraging that country join the League of Nations. Grey&#x27;s eyesight had deteriorated to near blindness by this stage and his appointment was a short-term one, for five months until 1920. He dealt with the issue of Irish independence, but failed to convince the U.S. to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. During his stay in the U.S. Grey was unable to obtain a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, a fact which he attributed to the influence of the Irish lobby, although Wilson had in fact suffered a severe stroke at the start of October 1919, but this was not widely known for several months.

By mid July 1920 Lord Robert Cecil, a moderate and staunchly pro-League of Nations Conservative, was keen for a party realignment under Grey, who was also a strong supporter of the League. Grey had been irritated by Asquith&#x27;s failure to congratulate him on his Washington appointment, but they reestablished relations in November 1920. Asquith reached an agreement with Grey on 29 June 1921, suggesting that he could be Leader in the Lords and Lord President of the Council in any future Liberal Government, as his eyesight was no longer good enough to cope with the paperwork of running a major department. Grey wanted British troops simply pulled out of Ireland and the Irish left to sort themselves out, a solution likened by Roy Jenkins to the British withdrawal from India in 1947.

The success of Anti-Waste League candidates at by-elections made leading Liberals feel that there was a strong vote which might be tapped by a wider-based and more credible opposition to Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition government. Talks between Grey and Lord Robert Cecil also began in June 1921. A wider meeting (Cecil, Asquith, Grey, and leading Liberals Lord Crewe, Walter Runciman and Sir Donald Maclean) was held on 5 July 1921. Cecil wanted a genuine coalition rather than a &quot;de facto&quot; Liberal government, with Grey rather than Asquith as prime minister, and an official manifesto by himself and Grey which the official Liberal leaders Asquith and Lord Crewe would then endorse. Another Conservative, Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, later joined in the talks, and his views were similar to Cecil&#x27;s, but Maclean, Runciman and Crewe were hostile. Grey himself was not keen, and his eyesight would have been a major handicap to his becoming prime minister. He missed the third meeting, saying that he was feeding squirrels in Northumberland, and was late for the fourth. He did, however, make a move by speaking in his former constituency in October 1921, to little effect, after which the move for a party realignment fizzled out.

Grey continued to be active in politics despite his near blindness, serving as Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords from 1923 until his resignation shortly before the 1924 election on the grounds that he was unable to attend on a regular basis. Having declined to stand for Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1925, to make way for Asquith&#x27;s unsuccessful bid, he was elected unopposed as in 1928 and held the position until his death in 1933.

==Personal life==
Grey married Dorothy, daughter of S. F. Widdrington, of Newton Hall, Northumberland, in 1885. They enjoyed a close relationship, sharing a fondness for peaceful rural pursuits at their country residence by the River Itchen, Hampshire. After her death in a road accident in February 1906, Grey remained single until marrying Pamela Adelaide Genevieve Wyndham, daughter of the Honourable Percy Wyndham and widow of Lord Glenconner, in 1922. There were no offspring from either marriage. According to Max Hastings, however, Grey had two illegitimate children as a result of extra-marital affairs. Edward James claimed that his sister Audrey Evelyn James, officially the daughter of William Dodge James and Evelyn Elizabeth Forbes, was actually one of the children of Grey.

During his university years Grey represented his college at football and was also an excellent tennis player being Oxford champion in 1883 (and winning the varsity competition the same year) and won the British championship in 1889, 1891, 1895, 1896 and 1898. He was runner-up in 1892, 1893 and 1894, years in which he held office. He was also a lifelong fly fisherman, publishing a book, &quot;Fly Fishing&quot;, on his exploits in 1899, which remains one of the most popular books ever written on the subject. He continued to fish by touch after his deteriorating eye-sight meant he was no longer able to see the fly or a rising fish. He was also an avid ornithologist; one of the best-known photographs of him shows him with a robin perched on his hat; &quot;The Charm of Birds&quot; was published in 1927. In 1933 he was one of eleven people involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), an organisation for the study of birds in the British Isles. He was, along with his fellow Liberal Haldane, one of the original members of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.

==Death==

Lady Grey of Fallodon died on 18 November 1928. Lord Grey of Fallodon remained a widower until his own death at Fallodon on 7 September 1933, aged 71, following which his body was cremated at Darlington. The viscountcy became extinct on his death, though he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his cousin, Sir George Grey. Grey is commemorated at Winchester College; by a relief next to the Ambassador&#x27;s entrance to the Foreign Office in Downing Street, London; by a bronze plaque at the summit of Ros Castle hill, Northumberland, one of his favourite viewpoints; by an inscription on the outer wall near the main entrance to The Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle-upon-Tyne (recording his presidency of the Natural History Society of Northumbria), and by the establishment of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at Oxford University. The railway workers at Fallodon planted a copper beech tree in his memory at the site of the private station. His ashes were interred with those of his wife Dorothy in woodland on the Fallodon estate, below a simple stone reading &quot;Here, among trees that they planted together, are placed the ashes of Edward and Dorothy Grey.&quot;

<text>Robert Michael Schneider (; born October 31, 1963) is an American actor, comedian and anti-vaccine activist. After several years performing stand-up comedy, Schneider achieved wider success as a cast member for the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1990 to 1994, which earned him three Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

Following his departure from &quot;SNL&quot;, he went on to a career in feature films, including starring roles in the comedy films &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; (1999) and its 2005 sequel, &quot;The Animal&quot; (2001), &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; (2002), &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot; (2006), and &quot;Big Stan&quot; (2007). Schneider is the father of singer Elle King.

== Early life ==
Schneider was born in San Francisco, California on October 31, 1963, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Pacifica. His parents were Pilar (née Monroe), a former kindergarten teacher and ex-school board president, and Marvin Schneider, a real estate broker. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic. Schneider&#x27;s maternal grandmother was a Filipina who met and married his grandfather, a white American army private, while he was stationed in the Philippines. His mixed background has been a common theme throughout his career. Schneider graduated from Terra Nova High School in 1982 and then attended San Francisco State University. His older brother, John, is a producer.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Schneider began his career doing stand-up comedy in San Francisco. He made his debut appearance on television in 1987, on HBO&#x27;s 13th Annual Young Comedians special, which was hosted by comedian Dennis Miller.

=== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===
After being hired as a writer for the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1988, Schneider was part of the show&#x27;s comedy team from 1990 to 1994. He played such roles as &quot;Tiny Elvis&quot;, &quot;Orgasm Guy&quot;, and Richard Laymer, the office worker beside the photocopier who addressed each of his fellow employees with an endless stream of annoying gossip. Schneider is featured in the video release &quot;The Bad Boys of Saturday Night Live&quot;, along with colleagues Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Chris Farley.

==== Recurring &quot;SNL&quot; characters ====
* The Richmeister, an office worker who annoys people by giving them nicknames as they make copies.
* Carlo, from the Il Cantore Restaurant sketches
* The Sensitive Naked Man, a nude man who gives advice to other characters

=== Feature films, sitcoms, and endorsements ===

After leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, Schneider played supporting roles in a series of movies including &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot;, &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, and &quot;Down Periscope&quot;. He also appeared in a recurring part on the television series &quot;Coach&quot;. In 1996, he co-starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;, an American take on the hit British series of the same name. The U.S. version ran for two seasons.

Schneider starred in the 1999 feature film &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot;, a tale of a fish-tank cleaner who incurs a massive debt and is forced to become a &quot;man-whore.&quot; This was followed by &quot;The Animal&quot;, about a man given animal powers by a mad scientist; &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;, wherein the body of a petty thief named Clive Maxtone (played by Schneider) is mystically switched with the body of a pretty, but mean-spirited high school cheerleader named Jessica Spencer (played by Rachel McAdams in her film debut); and the sequel &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot;. The latter movie was not well received by critics or moviegoers, and as a result, Schneider won a 2005 Worst Actor Razzie Award for his role in the film.

In 2006, Schneider co-starred in the baseball-themed family comedy &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot;, along with his fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus David Spade as well as Jon Heder. Other film roles include Schneider&#x27;s appearance with Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets in the 1999 film &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, and his role as a San Francisco hobo in the 2004 remake of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

Schneider&#x27;s directorial debut, the comedy &quot;Big Stan&quot;, was released in some overseas markets during the fall of 2008, with a U.S. release in early 2009. In the film, he starred as a real estate con artist who is arrested for perpetrating real-estate scams. He is sentenced to prison, so he takes a crash-course in martial arts to survive incarceration.

Schneider has also appeared in numerous comedies starring his &quot;SNL&quot; comrade Adam Sandler, including 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Waterboy,&quot; 2010&#x27;s &quot;Grown Ups,&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;Hubie Halloween&quot;. The comedic characters Schneider plays in these films include an overly enthusiastic Cajun man who proclaims the catch-phrase, &quot;You can do it!&quot;; an amiable Middle Eastern delivery boy; a prison inmate; and Sandler&#x27;s one-eyed Hawaiian sidekick, Ula. Schneider has uttered the line &quot;You can do it!&quot; as a running gag in Sandler&#x27;s films &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, &quot;Little Nicky&quot;, &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;, and &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, as well as in a deleted scene from &quot;Click&quot; (a sample of Schneider saying the phrase also turns up in the song &quot;Original Prankster&quot; by The Offspring). Returning the favor, Sandler appeared in a cameo to spout the same line in Schneider&#x27;s &quot;The Animal&quot;. Schneider narrated Sandler&#x27;s 2002 animated movie &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot;, and voiced the part of a Chinese waiter. Schneider also had an uncredited cameo as a Canadian-Japanese wedding-chapel minister in the 2007 Sandler-Kevin James comedy &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot;, and played a Palestinian cab driver who serves as the title character&#x27;s nemesis in the 2008 Sandler film &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;.

Schneider played a variety of roles in the 2005 television special &quot;Back to Norm&quot;, starring another former &quot;SNL&quot; player Norm Macdonald, and appeared on episodes of the popular television shows &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Schneider hosted the &quot;Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit &#x27;97&quot; TV special, and the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, and was a frequent guest on NBC&#x27;s late-night variety program &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In Schneider&#x27;s appearance with Leno on the July 24, 2007, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; he showed up in drag as actress Lindsay Lohan after the latter cancelled following a controversial arrest for driving under the influence.

Besides his efforts in movies and television, Schneider released his first comedy album &quot;Registered Offender&quot; in July 2010. &quot;Registered Offender&quot; is composed of audio sketches and songs, with Schneider himself doing all of the character voices on the recording. He also revived his stand-up comedy career in 2010 with an international tour of theaters, clubs, and casinos.

Schneider appeared in the music video for country singer Neal McCoy&#x27;s &quot;Billy&#x27;s Got His Beer Goggles On&quot;, as the song&#x27;s title character. McCoy and Schneider met while the two went on a USO tour in support of U.S. troops two months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Schneider starred as the title character in the CBS sitcom &quot;Rob&quot;, which was loosely based on his real life. The series ran for eight episodes starting on January 12, 2012 and was canceled in May. In 2015, he produced, directed and starred in &quot;Real Rob&quot;, a sitcom that follows his life and includes his real-life wife Patricia and daughter Miranda. Netflix released a season of 8 episodes, and a second season in 2017.

Schneider is the official celebrity spokesperson for the Taiwan Tourism Bureau and the Ten Ren Tea company in Taipei.

Schneider was spokesperson for State Farm Insurance, but was dropped in 2014 due to his anti-vaccination views.

In May 2016, Schneider was featured as a special guest on the Let&#x27;s Play webseries &quot;Game Grumps&quot;, alongside his wife Patricia, commentating over Midway&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;. They reappeared on the show in November 2017, then commentating over Konami&#x27;s &quot;Contra&quot;.

In 2021, Schneider competed on season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Hamster&quot;. A running gag is that &quot;Hamster&quot; would pantomime urinating on Nick Cannon and get affectionate with him. When unmasked on the fifth week, Schneider dedicated his performance of Luis Miguel&#x27;s &quot;Sabor a Mí&quot; to Patricia and his daughters Miranda, Madeline, and Elle. In addition, Schneider did a variation of his Townie character&#x27;s &quot;You can do it&quot; line by quoting Hamster&#x27;s final words &quot;You can do it Masked Singer, all night long!&quot;

In 2022, he starred, produced, and directed in &quot;Daddy Daughter Trip&quot;, which served as his third film as a director and also starred his wife Patricia and daughter Miranda. The film was to be exclusively shown in Harkins Theaters.

=== Standup ===
Rob Schneider has done different stand-up comedy gigs.

In December 2023, Schneider was hired to perform a standup show at an event put on by the Senate Working Group. The performance was scheduled to last 30 minutes, but the show was cancelled after 10 minutes due to offensive content. Attendees were sent letters of apology after the performance.

== Personal life ==
Schneider has a daughter with former model London King, musician Elle King, who was born in 1989. On September 1, 2021, King gave birth to a son named Lucky, Schneider&#x27;s first grandchild.

In 1996, Schneider established the Rob Schneider Music Foundation. The foundation returned music education to Pacifica&#x27;s elementary schools by paying the teachers&#x27; salaries and providing funds for instruments and other equipment. Prior to Schneider&#x27;s efforts, the school system had been without music education programs for years.

Schneider once co-owned the DNA Lounge, a San Francisco nightclub.

On April 23, 2011, Schneider married television producer Patricia Azarcoya Arce in Beverly Hills, California. Their first child, Miranda Scarlett Schneider, was born in 2012. The couple had their second daughter, Madeline Robbie Schneider, in September 2016. The family supports Mexican soccer club Tigres, which is based in Patricia&#x27;s hometown of Monterrey, Mexico. The family reside in Arizona.

In 2023, Schneider converted to Catholicism.

==Political views and positions==
In 2013, Schneider switched political parties from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, explaining: &quot;The state of California is a mess, and the super majority of Democrats is not working. I&#x27;ve been a lifelong Democrat and I have to switch over because it no longer serves the people of this great state.&quot; He endorsed Republican candidate Tim Donnelly for the 2014 California gubernatorial election.

In an interview on &quot;Larry King Now&quot; in 2017, Schneider said he was an independent but leaned more conservative.

In July 2023, Schneider endorsed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In August 2024, following the suspension of Kennedy&#x27;s campaign, Schneider endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump. Schneider was a headliner at the 2024 Moms for Liberty convention.

===Anti-vaccination activism===
Schneider has been a critic of childhood vaccinations. In an interview with News10 in Sacramento, Schneider opined that &quot;The efficacy of these shots have not been proven... And the toxicity of these thingswe&#x27;re having more and more side effects. We&#x27;re having more and more autism.&quot; He also views the actions from the state of California to mandate vaccinations as government overreach.

In 2015, Schneider actively opposed the passage of two California laws, California Assembly Bill 2109 and California Senate Bill 277, which both made childhood vaccination exemptions harder to obtain. On September 28, 2012, Schneider and California State Assemblyman Tim Donnelly spoke at the &quot;Medical Freedom Rally&quot;, where they urged California Governor Jerry Brown to veto Assembly Bill 2109, which would have made it more difficult for parents to use philosophical reasons for exemptions from mandatory childhood vaccinations. While the bill was not vetoed, Governor Brown added a signing message instructing the Department of Health to add a religious exemption and to make sure the process was not overly burdensome to parents.

While fighting California Senate Bill 277, which removed exemptions to mandatory vaccinations due to personal beliefs, Schneider left a phone message to California state Assemblywoman and bill co-author Lorena Gonzalez saying that he would spend money against her in her next re-election. Gonzalez, in an interview with &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, said that she found the message to be disturbing, but upon calling back, she said, &quot;he was actually much nicer to me, but let&#x27;s be honest... that is 20 mins of my life I&#x27;ll never get back arguing that vaccines don&#x27;t cause autism with &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot;.&quot;

===Removed off stage===
In June 2024, Schneider performed in Saskatchewan at a fundraising event for the Hospitals of Regina Foundation fundraiser (a Canadian medical not-for-profit organization), where he told jokes about vaccines, women, and transgender people. He was removed from the stage in the middle of his set by event organizers, who later apologized for his behaviour. Schneider has defended his jokes, stating “I’m doing it right.”

===Paris Olympics boycott===
In July 2024, Schneider posted on the social media platform X, &quot;I am sorry to say to ALL the world&#x27;s GREATEST ATHLETES, I wish you ALL THE BEST, but I cannot watch an Olympics that disrespects Christianity and openly celebrates Satan. I sincerely hope THESE @Olympics get the same amount of viewers as @cspan&quot;. This was in reaction to the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, which was accused of including drag queen performers burlesquing &quot;The Last Supper&quot; painting.

===Anti-LGBT views===
In 2023, Schneider made posts on social media criticizing the transgender TikTok influencer Dylan Mulvaney, calling her transgender identity &quot;cultural appropriation&quot;.

In August 2024, Schneider was a speaker at the 2024 national summit for the anti-LGBT group, Moms for Liberty.

In September 2024, Schneider&#x27;s daughter, Elle King distanced herself from Schneider and criticized his anti-LGBT comments.

<doc id="218239" wikidata="Q1264633" url="?curid=218239" title="Duke of Wellington (title)">
<text>Duke of Wellington is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The name derived from Wellington in Somerset. The title was created in 1814 for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington (1769–1852; born as The Hon. Arthur Wesley), the Anglo-Irish military commander who is best known for leading the decisive victory with Field Marshal von Blücher over Napoleon&#x27;s forces at Waterloo in Brabant (now Walloon Brabant, Belgium). Wellesley later served twice as British prime minister. In historical texts, unqualified use of the title typically refers to the 1st Duke.

The first Duke&#x27;s father, Garret Wesley, had been granted the title of Earl of Mornington in 1760. His male-line ancestors were wealthy agricultural and urban landowners in both countries, among the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy. The dukedom has descended to heirs male of the body, along with eleven other hereditary titles.

==History==
The titles of Duke of Wellington and Marquess Douro were bestowed upon Arthur Wellesley, 1st Marquess of Wellington, on 3 May 1814 after he returned home a hero following Napoleon&#x27;s abdication. He fought some sixty battles during his military career. He was considered &quot;the conqueror of Napoleon&quot;. He stands as one of the finest soldiers that Great Britain and Ireland has ever produced, others being the 1st Duke of Marlborough and the 2nd Duke of Argyll.

Following his victory at the Battle of Talavera, Wellesley was offered a peerage. The question was what title should he take. His brother, Richard Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, looked around and discovered that a manor in the parish of Wellington was available. It was also reasonably close to the family name. Because Arthur was still in Spain in command of the army fighting the French, Richard oversaw the purchase. By this process Arthur therefore became Marquess of Wellington. According to the book &quot;Wellington as Military Commander&quot; by Michael Glover, Arthur Wellesley first signed himself &#x27;Wellington&#x27; on 16 September 1809. At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Arthur Wellesley was already further elevated to the peerage rank of the Duke of Wellington. At the time he became Ambassador to France, &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 4 June 1814 refers to him as having that title but suggests that it was granted by warrant on 25 August 1812.

The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Wellington are &quot;Marquess of Wellington&quot; (1812), &quot;Marquess Douro&quot; (1814), &quot;Earl of Mornington&quot; (1760 – but only inherited by the Dukes of Wellington in 1863), &quot;Earl of Wellington&quot; (1812), &quot;Viscount Wellesley&quot; (1760 – inherited in 1863), &quot;Viscount Wellington&quot; (1809), &quot;Baron Mornington&quot; (1746 – also inherited in 1863), and &quot;Baron Douro&quot; (1809). The Viscountcy of Wellesley and the Barony and Earldom of Mornington are in the Peerage of Ireland; the rest are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Apart from the British titles, the Dukes of Wellington also hold the titles of Prince of Waterloo (&quot;Prins van Waterloo&quot;, 1815) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (&quot;Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo&quot;, 1812) of the Kingdom of Spain with Grandeeship, and Duke of Victoria (&quot;Duque da Vitória&quot;, 1812), with the subsidiary titles Marquess of Torres Vedras (&quot;Marquês de Torres Vedras&quot;, 1812) and Count of Vimeiro (&quot;Conde de Vimeiro&quot;, 1811) of the Kingdom of Portugal. These were granted to the first Duke as victory titles for his distinguished service as victorious commanding general in the Peninsular War (in Spain and Portugal) and at the Battle of Waterloo (in what is now Belgium).

The family seat is Stratfield Saye House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. Apsley House, in London, is now owned by English Heritage, although the family retain an apartment there. He also has a large estate outside Granada, Spain, which was granted to the first duke by Spanish King Ferdinand VII as a reward for his services in the Peninsular War.

Five Dukes have been created Knights of the Garter, the most senior British order of knighthood.

==Dukes of Wellington (1814)==


==Line of succession==

***&quot;Richard Wellesley (1920–1984)&quot;
****&quot;John Wellesley (1962–2009)&quot;
*****(12) Thomas Wellesley ()
Should the direct male line of succession from the first Duke of Wellington become extinct, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles in the British peerage will become extinct, as will the titles of Prince of Waterloo in the Dutch peerage and the dukedom of the Victory and its subsidiary titles in the Portuguese peerage. 

The dukedom of Ciudad Rodrigo in the Spanish peerage, together with its subsidiary titles, will continue to be held in the female line of descendants of the first Duke. The earldom and barony of Mornington, along with the viscountcy of Wellesley, which are all titles in the Irish peerage, will revert to the line of the Earl Cowley, a male-line descendant of a younger brother of the first Duke of Wellington.

The Colley or Cowley family had come to Ireland from Glaston, in Rutland about 1500; Sir Henry Colley was elevated to the Peerage as Lord Glaston by Henry VIII. He married the daughter of Thomas Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Catherine Wellesley Cusack () whose grandmother was a Wellesley. Upon the death of his cousin Garret Wesley and his inheritance of the Estates of Dangan and Mornington, Richard Colley () and his wife Elizabeth Sale (d. 17 June 1738) daughter of John Sale, Registrar of the Diocese of Dublin, on 23 December 1719. adopted the name Wellesley (from both Elizabeth&#x27;s maternal family side from Catherine Wellesley Cusack her grandmother) and through her Husband&#x27;s Family, his cousin, Garret Wesley (Wellesley).

<doc id="218247" wikidata="Q337594" url="?curid=218247" title="Advanced Audio Coding">
<text>Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is an audio coding standard for lossy digital audio compression. It was designed to be the successor of the MP3 format and generally achieves higher sound quality than MP3 at the same bit rate.

AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part of the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 specifications. Part of AAC, HE-AAC (&quot;AAC+&quot;), is part of MPEG-4 Audio and is adopted into digital radio standards DAB+ and Digital Radio Mondiale, and mobile television standards DVB-H and ATSC-M/H.

AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth (up to 96 kHz) audio channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects (LFE, limited to 120 Hz) channels, up to 16 &quot;coupling&quot; or dialog channels, and up to 16 data streams. The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest requirements at 96 kbit/s in joint stereo mode; however, hi-fi transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit/s (VBR). Tests of MPEG-4 audio have shown that AAC meets the requirements referred to as &quot;transparent&quot; for the ITU at 128 kbit/s for stereo, and 384 kbit/s for 5.1 audio. AAC uses only a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) algorithm, giving it higher compression efficiency than MP3, which uses a hybrid coding algorithm that is part MDCT and part FFT.

AAC is the default or standard audio format for iPhone, iPod, iPad, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS, Apple Music, iTunes, DivX Plus Web Player, PlayStation 4 and various Nokia Series 40 phones. It is supported on a wide range of devices and software such as PlayStation Vita, Wii, digital audio players like Sony Walkman or SanDisk Clip, Android and BlackBerry devices, various in-dash car audio systems, and is also one of the audio formats used on the Spotify web player.

==History==
===Background===
The discrete cosine transform (DCT), a type of transform coding for lossy compression, was proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, and developed by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1973, publishing their results in 1974. This led to the development of the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), proposed by J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson and A. B. Bradley in 1987, following earlier work by Princen and Bradley in 1986. The MP3 audio coding standard introduced in 1992 used a hybrid coding algorithm that is part MDCT and part FFT. AAC uses a purely MDCT algorithm, giving it higher compression efficiency than MP3. Development further advanced when Lars Liljeryd introduced a method that radically shrank the amount of information needed to store the digitized form of a song or speech.

AAC was developed with the cooperation and contributions of companies including Bell Labs, Fraunhofer IIS, Dolby Laboratories, LG Electronics, NEC, Panasonic, Sony Corporation, ETRI, JVC Kenwood, Philips, Microsoft, and NTT. It was officially declared an international standard by the Moving Picture Experts Group in April 1997. It is specified both as &quot;Part 7 of the MPEG-2 standard&quot;, and &quot;Subpart 4 in Part 3 of the MPEG-4 standard&quot;.

===Standardization===
In 1997, AAC was first introduced as &quot;MPEG-2 Part 7&quot;, formally known as &quot;ISO/IEC 13818-7:1997&quot;. This part of MPEG-2 was a new part, since MPEG-2 already included &quot;MPEG-2 Part 3&quot;, formally known as &quot;ISO/IEC 13818-3: MPEG-2 BC&quot; (Backwards Compatible). Therefore, MPEG-2 Part 7 is also known as &quot;MPEG-2 NBC&quot; (Non-Backward Compatible), because it is not compatible with the MPEG-1 audio formats (MP1, MP2 and MP3).

MPEG-2 Part 7 defined three profiles: &quot;Low-Complexity&quot; profile (AAC-LC / LC-AAC), &quot;Main&quot; profile (AAC Main) and &quot;Scalable Sampling Rate&quot; profile (AAC-SSR). AAC-LC profile consists of a base format very much like AT&amp;T&#x27;s Perceptual Audio Coding (PAC) coding format, with the addition of temporal noise shaping (TNS), the Kaiser window (described below), a nonuniform quantizer, and a reworking of the bitstream format to handle up to 16 stereo channels, 16 mono channels, 16 low-frequency effect (LFE) channels and 16 commentary channels in one bitstream. The Main profile adds a set of recursive predictors that are calculated on each tap of the filterbank. The SSR uses a 4-band PQMF filterbank, with four shorter filterbanks following, in order to allow for scalable sampling rates.

In 1999, MPEG-2 Part 7 was updated and included in the MPEG-4 family of standards and became known as &quot;MPEG-4 Part 3&quot;, &quot;MPEG-4 Audio&quot; or &quot;ISO/IEC 14496-3:1999&quot;. This update included several improvements. One of these improvements was the addition of &quot;Audio Object Types&quot; which are used to allow interoperability with a diverse range of other audio formats such as TwinVQ, CELP, HVXC, speech synthesis and MPEG-4 Structured Audio. Another notable addition in this version of the AAC standard is &quot;Perceptual Noise Substitution&quot; (PNS). In that regard, the AAC profiles (AAC-LC, AAC Main and AAC-SSR profiles) are combined with perceptual noise substitution and are defined in the MPEG-4 audio standard as Audio Object Types. MPEG-4 Audio Object Types are combined in four MPEG-4 Audio profiles: Main (which includes most of the MPEG-4 Audio Object Types), Scalable (AAC LC, AAC LTP, CELP, HVXC, TwinVQ, Wavetable Synthesis, TTSI), Speech (CELP, HVXC, TTSI) and Low Rate Synthesis (Wavetable Synthesis, TTSI).

The reference software for MPEG-4 Part 3 is specified in MPEG-4 Part 5 and the conformance bit-streams are specified in MPEG-4 Part 4. MPEG-4 Audio remains backward-compatible with MPEG-2 Part 7.

The MPEG-4 Audio Version 2 (ISO/IEC 14496-3:1999/Amd 1:2000) defined new audio object types: the low delay AAC (AAC-LD) object type, bit-sliced arithmetic coding (BSAC) object type, parametric audio coding using harmonic and individual line plus noise and error resilient (ER) versions of object types. It also defined four new audio profiles: High Quality Audio Profile, Low Delay Audio Profile, Natural Audio Profile and Mobile Audio Internetworking Profile.

The HE-AAC Profile (AAC LC with SBR) and AAC Profile (AAC LC) were first standardized in ISO/IEC 14496-3:2001/Amd 1:2003. The HE-AAC v2 Profile (AAC LC with SBR and Parametric Stereo) was first specified in ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005/Amd 2:2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 14496-3:2005/Amd.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Parametric Stereo audio object type used in HE-AAC v2 was first defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3:2001/Amd 2:2004.

The current version of the AAC standard is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009.

AAC+ v2 is also standardized by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) as TS 102005.

The MPEG-4 Part 3 standard also contains other ways of compressing sound. These include lossless compression formats, synthetic audio and low bit-rate compression formats generally used for speech.

===AAC&#x27;s improvements over MP3===
Advanced Audio Coding is designed to be the successor of the &quot;MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3&quot;, known as MP3 format, which was specified by ISO/IEC in 11172-3 (MPEG-1 Audio) and 13818-3 (MPEG-2 Audio).

Improvements include:
* more sample rates (from 8 to 96 kHz) than MP3 (16 to 48 kHz);
* up to 48 channels (MP3 supports up to two channels in MPEG-1 mode and up to 5.1 channels in MPEG-2 mode);
* arbitrary bit rates and variable frame length. Standardized constant bit rate with bit reservoir;
* higher efficiency and simpler filter bank. AAC uses a pure MDCT (modified discrete cosine transform), rather than MP3&#x27;s hybrid coding (which was part MDCT and part FFT);
* higher coding efficiency for stationary signals (AAC uses a blocksize of 1024 or 960 samples, allowing more efficient coding than MP3&#x27;s 576 sample blocks);
* higher coding accuracy for transient signals (AAC uses a blocksize of 128 or 120 samples, allowing more accurate coding than MP3&#x27;s 192 sample blocks);
* possibility to use Kaiser-Bessel derived window function to eliminate spectral leakage at the expense of widening the main lobe;
* much better handling of audio frequencies above 16 kHz;
* more flexible joint stereo (different methods can be used in different frequency ranges);
* additional modules (tools) added to increase compression efficiency: TNS, backwards prediction, perceptual noise substitution (PNS), etc. These modules can be combined to constitute different encoding profiles.

Overall, the AAC format allows developers more flexibility to design codecs than MP3 does, and corrects many of the design choices made in the original MPEG-1 audio specification. This increased flexibility often leads to more concurrent encoding strategies and, as a result, to more efficient compression. This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding, pure MDCT, and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete.

While the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support, primarily because MP3 was the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support.

==Functionality==
AAC is a wideband audio coding algorithm that exploits two primary coding strategies to dramatically reduce the amount of data needed to represent high-quality digital audio:
* Signal components that are perceptually irrelevant are discarded.
* Redundancies in the coded audio signal are eliminated.

The actual encoding process consists of the following steps:
* The signal is converted from time-domain to frequency-domain using forward modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). This is done by using filter banks that take an appropriate number of time samples and convert them to frequency samples.
* The frequency domain signal is quantized based on a psychoacoustic model and encoded.
* Internal error correction codes are added.
* The signal is stored or transmitted.
* In order to prevent corrupt samples, a modern implementation of the Luhn mod N algorithm is applied to each frame.

The MPEG-4 audio standard does not define a single or small set of highly efficient compression schemes but rather a complex toolbox to perform a wide range of operations from low bit rate speech coding to high-quality audio coding and music synthesis.

* The MPEG-4 audio coding algorithm family spans the range from low bit rate speech encoding (down to 2 kbit/s) to high-quality audio coding (at 64 kbit/s per channel and higher).
* AAC offers sampling frequencies between 8 kHz and 96 kHz and any number of channels between 1 and 48.
* In contrast to MP3&#x27;s hybrid filter bank, AAC uses the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) together with the increased window lengths of 1024 or 960 points.

AAC encoders can switch dynamically between a single MDCT block of length 1024 points or 8 blocks of 128 points (or between 960 points and 120 points, respectively).
* If a signal change or a transient occurs, 8 shorter windows of 128/120 points each are chosen for their better temporal resolution.
* By default, the longer 1024-point/960-point window is otherwise used because the increased frequency resolution allows for a more sophisticated psychoacoustic model, resulting in improved coding efficiency.

===Modular encoding===
AAC takes a modular approach to encoding. Depending on the complexity of the bitstream to be encoded, the desired performance and the acceptable output, implementers may create profiles to define which of a specific set of tools they want to use for a particular application.

The MPEG-2 Part 7 standard (Advanced Audio Coding) was first published in 1997 and offers three default profiles:

* Low Complexity (LC) – the simplest and most widely used and supported
* Main Profile (Main) – like the LC profile, with the addition of backwards prediction
* Scalable Sample Rate (SSR) a.k.a. Sample-Rate Scalable (SRS)

The MPEG-4 Part 3 standard (MPEG-4 Audio) defined various new compression tools (a.k.a. Audio Object Types) and their usage in brand new profiles. AAC is not used in some of the MPEG-4 Audio profiles. The MPEG-2 Part 7 AAC LC profile, AAC Main profile and AAC SSR profile are combined with Perceptual Noise Substitution and defined in the MPEG-4 Audio standard as Audio Object Types (under the name AAC LC, AAC Main and AAC SSR). These are combined with other Object Types in MPEG-4 Audio profiles. Here is a list of some audio profiles defined in the MPEG-4 standard:
* Main Audio Profile – defined in 1999, uses most of the MPEG-4 Audio Object Types (AAC Main, AAC-LC, AAC-SSR, AAC-LTP, AAC Scalable, TwinVQ, CELP, HVXC, TTSI, Main synthesis)
* Scalable Audio Profile – defined in 1999, uses AAC-LC, AAC-LTP, AAC Scalable, TwinVQ, CELP, HVXC, TTSI
* Speech Audio Profile – defined in 1999, uses CELP, HVXC, TTSI
* Synthetic Audio Profile – defined in 1999, TTSI, Main synthesis
* High Quality Audio Profile – defined in 2000, uses AAC-LC, AAC-LTP, AAC Scalable, CELP, ER-AAC-LC, ER-AAC-LTP, ER-AAC Scalable, ER-CELP
* Low Delay Audio Profile – defined in 2000, uses CELP, HVXC, TTSI, ER-AAC-LD, ER-CELP, ER-HVXC
* Low Delay AAC v2 - defined in 2012, uses AAC-LD, AAC-ELD and AAC-ELDv2
* Mobile Audio Internetworking Profile – defined in 2000, uses ER-AAC-LC, ER-AAC-Scalable, ER-TwinVQ, ER-BSAC, ER-AAC-LD
* AAC Profile – defined in 2003, uses AAC-LC
* High Efficiency AAC Profile – defined in 2003, uses AAC-LC, SBR
* High Efficiency AAC v2 Profile – defined in 2006, uses AAC-LC, SBR, PS
* Extended High Efficiency AAC xHE-AAC – defined in 2012, uses USAC
One of many improvements in MPEG-4 Audio is an Object Type called Long Term Prediction (LTP), which is an improvement of the Main profile using a forward predictor with lower computational complexity.

===AAC error protection toolkit===
Applying error protection enables error correction up to a certain extent. Error correcting codes are usually applied equally to the whole payload. However, since different parts of an AAC payload show different sensitivity to transmission errors, this would not be a very efficient approach.

The AAC payload can be subdivided into parts with different error sensitivities.
* Independent error correcting codes can be applied to any of these parts using the Error Protection (EP) tool defined in MPEG-4 Audio standard.
* This toolkit provides the error correcting capability to the most sensitive parts of the payload in order to keep the additional overhead low.
* The toolkit is backwardly compatible with simpler and pre-existing AAC decoders. A great deal of the toolkit&#x27;s error correction functions are based around spreading information about the audio signal more evenly in the datastream.

===Error Resilient (ER) AAC===
Error Resilience (ER) techniques can be used to make the coding scheme itself more robust against errors.

For AAC, three custom-tailored methods were developed and defined in MPEG-4 Audio
* Huffman Codeword Reordering (HCR) to avoid error propagation within spectral data
* Virtual Codebooks (VCB11) to detect serious errors within spectral data
* Reversible Variable Length Code (RVLC) to reduce error propagation within scale factor data

===AAC Low Delay===
The audio coding standards MPEG-4 Low Delay (AAC-LD), Enhanced Low Delay (AAC-ELD), and Enhanced Low Delay v2 (AAC-ELDv2) as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009 and ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009/Amd 3 are designed to combine the advantages of perceptual audio coding with the low delay necessary for two-way communication. They are closely derived from the MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format. AAC-ELD is recommended by GSMA as super-wideband voice codec in the IMS Profile for High Definition Video Conference (HDVC) Service.

==Licensing and patents==
No licenses or payments are required for a user to stream or distribute audio in AAC format. This reason alone might have made AAC a more attractive format to distribute audio than its predecessor MP3, particularly for streaming audio (such as Internet radio) depending on the use case.

However, a patent license is required for all manufacturers or developers of AAC &quot;end-user&quot; codecs. The terms (as disclosed to SEC) uses per-unit pricing. In the case of software, each computer running the software is to be considered a separate &quot;unit&quot;.

It used to be common for free and open source software implementations such as FFmpeg and FAAC to only distribute in source code form so as to not &quot;otherwise supply&quot; an AAC codec. However, FFmpeg has since become more lenient on patent matters: the &quot;gyan.dev&quot; builds recommended by the official site now contain its AAC codec, with the FFmpeg legal page stating that patent law conformance is the user&#x27;s responsibility. (See below under Products that support AAC, Software.) The Fedora Project, a community backed by Red Hat, has imported the &quot;Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android&quot; to its repositories on September 25, 2018, and has enabled FFmpeg&#x27;s native AAC encoder and decoder for its ffmpeg-free package on January 31, 2023.

The AAC patent holders include Bell Labs, Dolby, ETRI, Fraunhofer, JVC Kenwood, LG Electronics, Microsoft, NEC, NTT (and its subsidiary NTT Docomo), Panasonic, Philips, and Sony Corporation. Based on the list of patents from the SEC terms, the last baseline AAC patent expires in 2028, and the last patent for all AAC extensions mentioned expires in 2031.

==Extensions and improvements==
Some extensions have been added to the first AAC standard (defined in MPEG-2 Part 7 in 1997):
* Perceptual Noise Substitution (PNS), added in MPEG-4 in 1999. It allows the coding of noise as pseudorandom data.
* Long Term Predictor (LTP), added in MPEG-4 in 1999. It is a forward predictor with lower computational complexity.
* Error Resilience (ER), added in MPEG-4 Audio version 2 in 2000, used for transport over error prone channels
*AAC-LD (Low Delay), defined in 2000, used for real-time conversation applications
*High Efficiency AAC (HE-AAC), a.k.a. aacPlus v1 or AAC+, the combination of SBR (Spectral Band Replication) and AAC LC. Used for low bitrates. Defined in 2003.
*HE-AAC v2, a.k.a. aacPlus v2, eAAC+ or Enhanced aacPlus, the combination of Parametric Stereo (PS) and HE-AAC; used for even lower bitrates. Defined in 2004 and 2006.
*xHE-AAC, extends the operating range of the codec from 12 to 300 kbit/s.
*MPEG-4 Scalable To Lossless (SLS), Not yet published, can supplement an AAC stream to provide a lossless decoding option, such as in Fraunhofer IIS&#x27;s &quot;HD-AAC&quot; product

==Container formats==
In addition to the MP4, 3GP and other container formats based on ISO base media file format for file storage, AAC audio data was first packaged in a file for the MPEG-2 standard using Audio Data Interchange Format (ADIF), consisting of a single header followed by the raw AAC audio data blocks. However, if the data is to be streamed within an MPEG-2 transport stream, a self-synchronizing format called an Audio Data Transport Stream (ADTS) is used, consisting of a series of frames, each frame having a header followed by the AAC audio data. This file and streaming-based format are defined in MPEG-2 Part 7, but are only considered informative by MPEG-4, so an MPEG-4 decoder does not need to support either format. These containers, as well as a raw AAC stream, may bear the .aac file extension. MPEG-4 Part 3 also defines its own self-synchronizing format called a Low Overhead Audio Stream (LOAS) that encapsulates not only AAC, but any MPEG-4 audio compression scheme such as TwinVQ and ALS. This format is what was defined for use in DVB transport streams when encoders use either SBR or parametric stereo AAC extensions. However, it is restricted to only a single non-multiplexed AAC stream. This format is also referred to as a Low Overhead Audio Transport Multiplex (LATM), which is just an interleaved multiple stream version of a LOAS.

==Products that support AAC==
===HDTV Standards===

====Japanese ISDB-T====
In December 2003, Japan started broadcasting terrestrial DTV ISDB-T standard that implements MPEG-2 video and MPEG-2 AAC audio.
In April 2006 Japan started broadcasting the ISDB-T mobile sub-program, called 1seg, that was the first implementation of video H.264/AVC with audio HE-AAC in Terrestrial HDTV broadcasting service on the planet.

====International ISDB-Tb====
In December 2007, Brazil started broadcasting terrestrial DTV standard called International ISDB-Tb that implements video coding H.264/AVC with audio AAC-LC on main program (single or multi) and video H.264/AVC with audio HE-AACv2 in the 1seg mobile sub-program.

====DVB====
The ETSI, the standards governing body for the DVB suite, supports AAC, HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 audio coding in DVB applications since at least 2004. DVB broadcasts which use the H.264 compression for video normally use HE-AAC for audio.

===Hardware===

====iTunes and iPod====
In April 2003, Apple brought mainstream attention to AAC by announcing that its iTunes and iPod products would support songs in MPEG-4 AAC format (via a firmware update for older iPods). Customers could download music in a closed-source digital rights management (DRM)-restricted form of 128 kbit/s AAC (see FairPlay) via the iTunes Store or create files without DRM from their own CDs using iTunes. In later years, Apple began offering music videos and movies, which also use AAC for audio encoding.

On May 29, 2007, Apple began selling songs and music videos from participating record labels at higher bitrate (256 kbit/s cVBR) and free of DRM, a format dubbed &quot;iTunes Plus&quot; . These files mostly adhere to the AAC standard and are playable on many non-Apple products but they do include custom iTunes information such as album artwork and a purchase receipt, so as to identify the customer in case the file is leaked out onto peer-to-peer networks. It is possible, however, to remove these custom tags to restore interoperability with players that conform strictly to the AAC specification. As of January 6, 2009, nearly all music on the USA regioned iTunes Store became DRM-free, with the remainder becoming DRM-free by the end of March 2009.

iTunes offers a &quot;Variable Bit Rate&quot; encoding option which encodes AAC tracks in the Constrained Variable Bitrate scheme (a less strict variant of ABR encoding); the underlying QuickTime API does offer a true VBR encoding profile however.

As of September 2009, Apple has added support for HE-AAC (which is fully part of the MP4 standard) only for radio streams, not file playback, and iTunes still lacks support for true VBR encoding.

==== Other portable players ====

====Mobile phones====
For a number of years, many mobile phones from manufacturers such as Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, BenQ-Siemens and Philips have supported AAC playback. The first such phone was the Nokia 5510 released in 2002 which also plays MP3s. However, this phone was a commercial failure and such phones with integrated music players did not gain mainstream popularity until 2005 when the trend of having AAC as well as MP3 support continued. Most new smartphones and music-themed phones support playback of these formats.
* Sony Ericsson phones support various AAC formats in MP4 container. AAC-LC is supported in all phones beginning with K700, phones beginning with W550 have support of HE-AAC. The latest devices such as the P990, K610, W890i and later support HE-AAC v2.
* Nokia XpressMusic and other new generation Nokia multimedia phones like N- and E-Series also support AAC format in LC, HE, M4A and HEv2 profiles. These also supports playing LTP-encoded AAC audio.
* BlackBerry phones running the BlackBerry 10 operating system support AAC playback natively. Select previous generation BlackBerry OS devices also support AAC.
* bada OS
* Apple&#x27;s iPhone supports AAC and FairPlay protected AAC files formerly used as the default encoding format in the iTunes Store until the removal of DRM restrictions in March 2009.
* Android 2.3 and later supports AAC-LC, HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 in MP4 or M4A containers along with several other audio formats. Android 3.1 and later supports raw ADTS files. Android 4.1 can encode AAC.
* WebOS by HP/Palm supports AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, and .m4a containers in its native music player as well as several third-party players. However, it does not support Apple&#x27;s FairPlay DRM files downloaded from iTunes.
* Windows Phone&#x27;s Silverlight runtime supports AAC-LC, HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 decoding.

====Other devices====
*Apple&#x27;s iPad: Supports AAC and FairPlay protected AAC files used as the default encoding format in the iTunes Store
*Palm OS PDAs: Many Palm OS based PDAs and smartphones can play AAC and HE-AAC with the 3rd party software Pocket Tunes. Version 4.0, released in December 2006, added support for native AAC and HE-AAC files. The AAC codec for TCPMP, a popular video player, was withdrawn after version 0.66 due to patent issues, but can still be downloaded from sites other than corecodec.org. CorePlayer, the commercial follow-on to TCPMP, includes AAC support. Other Palm OS programs supporting AAC include Kinoma Player and AeroPlayer.
*Windows Mobile: Supports AAC either by the native Windows Media Player or by third-party products (TCPMP, CorePlayer)
*Epson: Supports AAC playback in the P-2000 and P-4000 Multimedia/Photo Storage Viewers
*Sony Reader: plays M4A files containing AAC, and displays metadata created by iTunes. Other Sony products, including the A and E series Network Walkmans, support AAC with firmware updates (released May 2006) while the S series supports it out of the box.
*Sonos Digital Media Player: supports playback of AAC files
*Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Color: supports playback of AAC encoded files
*Roku SoundBridge: a network audio player, supports playback of AAC encoded files
*Squeezebox: network audio player (made by Slim Devices, a Logitech company) that supports playback of AAC files
*PlayStation 3: supports encoding and decoding of AAC files
*Xbox 360: supports streaming of AAC through the Zune software, and of supported iPods connected through the USB port
*Wii: supports AAC files through version 1.1 of the Photo Channel as of December 11, 2007. All AAC profiles and bitrates are supported as long as it is in the .m4a file extension. The 1.1 update removed MP3 compatibility, but according to Nintendo, users who have installed this may freely downgrade to the old version if they wish.
*Livescribe Pulse and Echo Smartpens: record and store audio in AAC format. The audio files can be replayed using the pen&#x27;s integrated speaker, attached headphones, or on a computer using the Livescribe Desktop software. The AAC files are stored in the user&#x27;s &quot;My Documents&quot; folder of the Windows OS and can be distributed and played without specialized hardware or software from Livescribe.
*Google Chromecast: supports playback of LC-AAC and HE-AAC audio

===Software===
Almost all current computer media players include built-in decoders for AAC, or can utilize a library to decode it. On Microsoft Windows, DirectShow can be used this way with the corresponding filters to enable AAC playback in any DirectShow based player. Mac OS X supports AAC via the QuickTime libraries.

Adobe Flash Player, since version 9 update 3, can also play back AAC streams. Since Flash Player is also a browser plugin, it can play AAC files through a browser as well.

The Rockbox open source firmware (available for multiple portable players) also offers support for AAC to varying degrees, depending on the model of player and the AAC profile.

Optional iPod support (playback of unprotected AAC files) for the Xbox 360 is available as a free download from Xbox Live.

The following is a non-comprehensive list of other software player applications:
*3ivx MPEG-4: a suite of DirectShow and QuickTime plugins which support AAC encoding or AAC/ HE-AAC decoding in any DirectShow application
*CorePlayer: also supports LC and HE AAC
*ffdshow: a free open source DirectShow filter for Microsoft Windows that uses FAAD2 to support AAC decoding
*foobar2000: a freeware audio player for Windows that supports LC and HE AAC
*KMPlayer
*MediaMonkey
*AIMP
*Media Player Classic Home Cinema
* mp3tag
*MPlayer or xine: often used as AAC decoders on Linux or Macintosh
*MusicBee: an advanced music manager and player that also supports encoding and ripping through a plugin
*RealPlayer: includes RealNetworks&#x27; RealAudio 10 AAC encoder
*Songbird: supports AAC on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, including the DRM rights management encoding used for purchased music from the iTunes Store, with a plug-in
*Sony SonicStage
*VLC media player: supports playback and encoding of MP4 and raw AAC files
*Winamp for Windows: includes an AAC encoder that supports LC and HE AAC
*Windows Media Player 12: released with Windows 7, supports playback of AAC files natively
*Another Real: Rhapsody supports the RealAudio AAC codec, in addition to offering subscription tracks encoded with AAC
*XBMC: supports AAC (both LC and HE).
*XMMS: supports MP4 playback using a plugin provided by the faad2 library
Some of these players (e.g., foobar2000, Winamp, and VLC) also support the decoding of ADTS (Audio Data Transport Stream) using the SHOUTcast protocol. Plug-ins for Winamp and foobar2000 enable the creation of such streams.

====Nero Digital Audio====
In May 2006, Nero AG released an AAC encoding tool free of charge, &quot;Nero Digital Audio&quot; (the AAC codec portion has become Nero AAC Codec), which is capable of encoding LC-AAC, HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 streams. The tool is a command-line interface tool only. A separate utility is also included to decode to PCM WAV.

Various tools including the foobar2000 audio player and MediaCoder can provide a GUI for this encoder.

====FAAC and FAAD2====

FAAC and FAAD2 stand for Freeware Advanced Audio Coder and Decoder 2 respectively. FAAC supports audio object types LC, Main and LTP. FAAD2 supports audio object types LC, Main, LTP, SBR and PS. Although FAAD2 is free software, FAAC is not free software.

====Fraunhofer FDK AAC====

A Fraunhofer-authored open-source encoder/decoder included in Android has been ported to other platforms. FFmpeg’s native AAC encoder does not support HE-AAC and HE-AACv2, but GPL 2.0+ of ffmpeg is not compatible with FDK AAC, hence ffmpeg with libfdk-aac is not redistributable. The QAAC encoder that is using Apple&#x27;s Core Media Audio is still higher quality than FDK.

====FFmpeg and Libav====

The native AAC encoder created in FFmpeg&#x27;s libavcodec, and forked with Libav, was considered experimental and poor. A significant amount of work was done for the 3.0 release of FFmpeg (February 2016) to make its version usable and competitive with the rest of the AAC encoders. Libav has not merged this work and continues to use the older version of the AAC encoder. These encoders are LGPL-licensed open-source and can be built for any platform that the FFmpeg or Libav frameworks can be built.

Both FFmpeg and Libav can use the Fraunhofer FDK AAC library via libfdk-aac, and while the FFmpeg native encoder has become stable and good enough for common use, FDK is still considered the highest quality encoder available for use with FFmpeg. Libav also recommends using FDK AAC if it is available. FFmpeg 4.4 and above can also use the Apple audiotoolbox encoder.

Although the native AAC encoder only produces AAC-LC, ffmpeg&#x27;s native decoder is able to deal with a wide range of input formats.

<doc id="218258" wikidata="Q2305063" url="?curid=218258" title="Nearco">
<text>Nearco (January 24, 1935 – June 27, 1957) was an Italian-bred Thoroughbred racehorse described by &quot;Thoroughbred Heritage&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest racehorses of the Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;one of the most important sires of the century.&quot; He was unbeaten, winning 14 races at distances from 1000m (5 furlongs) to 3000m (1 mile 7 furlongs), including the Derby Italiano and Grand Prix de Paris. He was then sold for a record amount to Martin H. Benson and stood stud in England, where he became the patriarch of several of the most dominant sire lines in Thoroughbred history.

==Breeding==
Nearco was bred in Italy by Federico Tesio, who also bred several other champions including the undefeated Ribot. His dam was the excellent racemare Nogara, who had won the Italian 1000 and 2000 guineas and was Italian champion filly at ages two and three. In 1934, Tesio wished to breed Nogara to the leading English sire Fairway, but was unable to obtain a nomination. Therefore, Tesio chose to breed Nogara to Fairway&#x27;s full brother, Pharos.

Nearco stood just over and had nearly perfect conformation. He was known for his fiery temperament and explosive turn of foot, traits he passed on to many of his descendants. After retiring to stud, Nearco could only be handled by his groom Ernie Lee.

==Racing record==

===Two-year-old season===
In 1937, Nearco won all seven of his starts on his way to being named Italian champion two-year-old. His races were as follows:

In his 1986 book &quot;Makers of the Modern Thoroughbred&quot;, Peter Willett wrote that Tesio tried to sell Nearco at two, believing that the colt would not have enough stamina to last the classic distances. Tesio later wrote in his stud book, &quot;Not a true stayer, though he won up to 3,000 meters... He won these longer races by his superb class and brilliant speed.&quot;

===Three-year-old season===
In 1938, Nearco again won all seven starts and was named Italian champion three-year-old and Horse of the Year. His races were as follows:
==Stud career==
Nearco retired undefeated after 14 races. With the political turmoil and the possibility of war caused by Benito Mussolini aligning Italy with Nazi Germany, Federico Tesio sold Nearco in 1938 to Martin H. Benson of Beech House Stud in Newmarket, England, for £60,000 (a world record for a sire in those days; ). The potential importance of Nearco&#x27;s progeny was forecast in the provision of a bomb shelter to ensure his survival should Newmarket be subject to an air raid.

Nearco was one of the top 10 sires in England for 15 years. He was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1947 and, depending on the source, either 1948 or 1949 or both. From 482 named foals, he sired 273 winners (56.6%) and 87 stakes winners (18.0%). His major stakes winners include:
* Nasrullah, top rated two-year-old of 1942
* Dante, 1945 Epsom Derby
* Royal Charger, 1946 Queen Anne Stakes
* Sayajirao, 1947 St. Leger Stakes
* Masaka, 1948 Epsom and Irish Oaks
* Nimbus, 1949 Epsom Derby and 2,000 Guineas
* Mossborough, sire of Ballymoss
* Neasham Belle, 1951 Epsom Oaks
* Hafiz, 1955 Queen Elizabeth II and Champion Stakes
* Nearctic, 1958 Canadian Horse of the Year

Nearco was also the damsire of the French multiple Group One winner Charlottesville, and damsire of the Epsom Derby winners Arctic Prince (1948) and Tulyar (1952).

Nearco died from cancer on 27 June 1957, and was buried at Beech House Stud.

==Sire of sires==
Nearco&#x27;s legacy primarily comes from three of his sons, Nasrullah, Royal Charger and Nearctic, although several other sons also sired important winners. In all, more than 100 of Nearco&#x27;s sons have stood at stud around the world.

Nasrullah was the first son of Nearco to distinguish himself as a sire, first in England and then in America. Nasrullah&#x27;s important sire sons include:
* Grey Sovereign, to whom 2016 Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist descends through the Caro sire line
* Red God, whose modern descendants include 2010 Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom through the Blushing Groom sire line
* Bold Ruler, eight-time leading sire in the United States, whose descendants include Triple Crown winners Secretariat and Seattle Slew. More recently, Seattle Slew has established a successful sire line that has produced several American classic winners including California Chrome
* Never Bend, sire of Mill Reef, whose modern descendants include Sir Percy and Dalakhani

Royal Charger&#x27;s most important son was Turn-To, whose most important sire sons were Halo and Roberto. Halo was the sire of dual classic winner Sunday Silence, who then became the leading sire in Japan from 1995 through 2007. Sunday Silence is the sire of numerous Japanese champions including Deep Impact, and is the grandsire of the top-rated horse of 2014 Just A Way.

Nearctic is principally known as the sire of Northern Dancer, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness before becoming one of the dominant sires of the late 20th century. Northern Dancer sired numerable sons who themselves went on to become outstanding sires, principally Nijinsky, Lyphard, Nureyev, Storm Bird, Danzig and Sadler&#x27;s Wells. The Northern Dancer sire line accounts for hundreds of major winners from around the world, particularly in Europe. His modern descendants include Justify, Galileo, Ouija Board, Sea the Stars, Black Caviar, Frankel and Treve.

Several of Nearco&#x27;s male-line descendants were ranked among the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century by &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot;: #2 Secretariat, #9 Seattle Slew, #10 Spectacular Bid, #18 Cigar, #19 Bold Ruler, #24 Nashua, #31 Sunday Silence, #35 Ruffian, #43 Northern Dancer, #57 Riva Ridge, #58 Slew o&#x27; Gold, #69 Noor, #70 Shuvee, #72 Go For Wand, #76 Lady&#x27;s Secret, #82 Miesque, #85 Lure, #86 Fort Marcy, #90 Davona Dale, #95 Bayakoa and #97 Foolish Pleasure.

Other notable male-line descendants were Ballymoss, Arkle, Never Say Die, Royal Palace, Better Loosen Up, Sir Ivor, Invasor, Wise Dan, and Summer Breeze. Sireline descendants of Nearco include eight of the first nine horses to earn over $10,000,000 in stakes wins. These horses are Deep Impact, Makybe Diva, Narita Brian, Sunline, Symboli Kris S, T M Opera O, Viva Pataca, and Vodka.

According to France Galop, from 1985 through to 2010, every Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe winner can trace a bloodline back to Nearco, through his son Nasrullah and / or his grandson Northern Dancer. Including the influence of the daughters from his sire line, it is increasingly rare to find a Thoroughbred without some trace of Nearco in its pedigree. For example, while 2023 Preakness Stakes winner National Treasure comes from the rival Mr. Prospector sire line, in the fifth generation of National Treasure&#x27;s pedigree Mr. Prospector&#x27;s sire Raise a Native appears twice, while Secretariat (great-grandson of Nearco through Nasrullah and Bold Ruler) and Sir Ivor (great-great-grandson through Royal Charger, Turn-To, and Sir Gaylord) both appear twice and Northern Dancer (grandson through Nearctic) appears three times. Nijinsky (a son of Northern Dancer), Red God (a son of Nasrullah), Bold Bidder (a son of Bold Ruler), and Rich Gift (great-grandson of Nearco through Nasrullah and Princely Gift) each appear once.
On the distaff side, Mr. Prospector&#x27;s dam Gold Digger is a great-granddaughter of Nearco through Nasrullah and Nashua, Sweet Tooth a great-granddaughter through Nasrullah and On-and-On, and Fairy Bridge a great-great-great-granddaughter through Royal Charger, Turn-To, Hail to Reason, and Bold Reason(and her dam also has a maternal line to Nearco).

==Pedigree==
Fairway and Pharos were full brothers by leading sire Phalaris out of the great broodmare Scapa Flow. Fairway was the more successful racehorse, whose wins included the St Leger and Eclipse Stakes, and also initially was the more successful sire, leading the sire list in Great Britain four times. Pharos was a solid racehorse, winning multiple stakes races and finishing second in the Derby. Pharos also proved himself as a sire, leading the British sire list in 1931. Tesio originally wished to breed his mare Nogara to Fairway, but was unable to obtain a nomination so bred her to Pharos instead.

Nearco&#x27;s dam Nogara was only but became a champion on the racetrack and then an outstanding broodmare. In addition to Nearco, she produced seven other winners, including Derby Italiano winner Niccolo dell&#x27;Arca, Oaks d&#x27;Italia winner Nervesa, and stakes winners Nakamuro, Naucide and Niccolo d&#x27;Arezzo. Nogara&#x27;s dam Catnip was a &quot;weedy&quot; foal by Epsom Derby winner Spearmint. Purchased by Tesio at the Newmarket sales for just 75 guineas, Catnip went on to produce multiple stakes winners and stakes producers.

Nearco was inbred 5 x 4 x 4 x 5 to St. Simon, meaning St. Simon appears twice in the fourth generation and twice again in the fifth generation of his pedigree.

<text>The Christological argument is the argument for the existence of God, which holds that if certain claims about Jesus are valid, then one should accept that God exists. 

Notable proponents of this argument include Gary Habermas and William Lane Craig.

==Versions of the argument==
===Argument from the wisdom of Jesus===
The essential structure of this argument is as follows:
# The character and wisdom of Jesus is such that his views about reality are (or are likely to be) correct.
# One of Jesus&#x27; views about reality was that God exists.
# Therefore, the view that God exists is (or is likely to be) correct.

Some forms of evangelism take this approach. Potential converts are introduced to Jesus as a historical character and the merits of Jesus&#x27; teachings are discussed. In such a context, the historicity of Jesus is a crucial factor in assessing the argument.

The principal objections to (1) are the suggestions that:
# The reports of Jesus&#x27; character in the Bible are not reliable.
# Jesus&#x27; views about reality are not (or not likely to be) necessarily correct. Bertrand Russell, in his essay &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot;, criticized Jesus&#x27; personal character and philosophical positions on various grounds.
# Even supposing that Jesus was correct, wise, and knowledgeable about a great many things does not imply that he was knowledgeable about everything. A deep knowledge of moral philosophy and the iniquities of the human condition, for example, do not necessarily imply any valid expertise on astrophysics, Phoenician literature, or the literal existence of God.

===Argument from the claims of Jesus to divinity===

Lewis&#x27;s trilemma is an apologetic argument traditionally used to argue for the divinity of Jesus by arguing that the only alternatives were that he was evil or deluded. One version was popularised by University of Oxford literary scholar and writer C. S. Lewis in a BBC radio talk and in his writings. It is sometimes described as the &quot;Lunatic, Liar, or Lord&quot;, or &quot;Mad, Bad, or God&quot; argument. It takes the form of a trilemma—a choice among three options, each of which is in some way difficult to accept.

This argument is very popular with Christian apologists, although some theologians and biblical scholars do not view Jesus as having claimed to be God. Some argue that he identified himself as a divine agent, with a unique relationship to Israel&#x27;s God. Others see him as wanting to direct attention to the divine kingdom he proclaimed.

The argument relies on the premise that Jesus was a great moral teacher. The structure of the argument is as follows:
# Jesus claimed to be God
# Jesus was a wise moral teacher
# By the trilemma, Jesus was dishonest, deluded or God
# No wise moral teacher is dishonest
# No wise moral teacher is deluded
# By 2 and 4, Jesus was not dishonest
# By 2 and 5, Jesus was not deluded
# By 3, 6 and 7, Jesus was God
# By 8, God exists

Those who dispute these premises suggest that:
# Disputing premise 1: Jesus was indeed a wise moral teacher, but his reported teachings have been distorted or misrepresented. For instance, he may not have actually claimed to be divine; this claim may have been added by later writers. Many modern New Testament scholars argue that Jesus did not, in fact, claim to be God.
# Disputing premise 2: C.S. Lewis expressed the opinion that any mere man who claimed to be God could not, by definition, be a wise moral teacher (and that, conversely, any wise moral teacher would not claim to be God). Christopher Hitchens argued that Jesus was not a wise moral teacher by arguing against several of his teachings. For example, of Jesus&#x27; teaching &quot;Let him who is without sin cast the first stone&quot;, Hitchens wrote: &quot;if only the non-sinners have the right to punish, then how could an imperfect society ever determine how to prosecute offenders?&quot;
# Disputing premise 4: A person can be a wise moral teacher despite lying. Jesus could have believed (as some later philosophers have held) that religion is false but beneficial to society, and that by establishing a new religion (or a reform of Judaism) he was doing a good deed nonetheless. And a wise moral teacher who is not God certainly suffers, as all men, from human weakness. Jesus could have been a wise moral teacher, and yet made an error of judgement (as the Bible itself records of Moses, David, and Elijah who it views as wise moral teachers who were rebuked by God or his prophets), even one as extreme as declaring himself to be a God. Or, someone can begin with wisdom and moral teachings and be corrupted by experience of power to commit particular abuses, even though his teachings are wise and moral.
# Disputing premise 5: A person can be a wise moral teacher despite being delusional. Granting credence to some, or even most, of someone&#x27;s claims does not require that we give credence to all of them. Someone can believe Socrates&#x27; philosophical claims about justice without also believing Socrates&#x27; theological speculations about the Greek gods, or accept Aristotle&#x27;s views on poetry without also accepting his claim that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones.

Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewis&#x27;s arguments as &quot;textually careless and theologically unreliable&quot;, and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of false dilemma. New Testament scholar N. T. Wright criticises Lewis for failing to recognise the significance of Jesus&#x27; Jewish identity and setting—an oversight which &quot;at best, drastically short-circuits the argument&quot; and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument &quot;doesn&#x27;t work as history, and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels&quot;, although he believes this &quot;doesn&#x27;t undermine the eventual claim&quot;.

===Argument from the resurrection===
Another argument is that the resurrection of Jesus occurred and was an act of God, hence God must exist. Some versions of this argument have been presented, such as N. T. Wright&#x27;s argument from the nature of the claim of resurrection to its occurrence and the &quot;minimal facts argument&quot;, defended by scholars such as Gary Habermas and Mike Licona, which defend that God raising Jesus from the dead is &quot;the best explanation for a set of claimed historical facts about Jesus and his disciples&quot;.

William Lane Craig, another advocate of this last argument, includes in the list of facts: 
# After his crucifixion, Jesus was buried in a tomb by Joseph of Arimathea
# On the Sunday following the crucifixion, Jesus’ tomb was found empty by a group of his women followers 
# On multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive from the dead 
# The original disciples believed that Jesus was risen from the dead despite their having every predisposition to the contrary.

In light of these, he goes on to say the best explanation is that God raised Jesus from the dead.

Such arguments have had many responses which depends on the version in question. The &quot;minimal facts argument&quot;, for instance, have been criticized both regarding the actual veracity of the claimed historical facts as well as the inference to the best explanation being that God rose Jesus from the dead. In the second case, people such as Gerd Lüdemann justify their rejection based on philosophical reasons while others, such as Bart D. Ehrman, do by more methodological reasons. Regarding the claimed facts, Ehrman and others defend that the sources used in their defense (normally the Gospels) are not trustworthy and so the facts cannot be credibly established.

This is the major position in Islam, which rejects that Jesus ever was crucified. Islamic texts categorically deny the crucifixion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews. The Qur&#x27;an states that the Jews sought to kill Jesus, but they did not kill or crucify him, although a likeness of it was shown to them. Traditionalists believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead was raised alive into heaven. This raising is understood by them to mean bodily ascension, while some Qur&#x27;anic scholars, such as Muhammad Asad, while cross referencing the text consider it to mean being raised in honour: 
According to some Muslim traditions, Jesus was replaced by a double; others suggest it was Simon of Cyrene, or one of the disciples such as Judas Iscariot. Some others view it as Jesus surviving the crucifixion. A minority of commentaries of Ismaili or rationalist (&quot;falāsifa&quot;) leaning affirmed the crucifixion by arguing that Jesus&#x27; body had been crucified, but his spirit had ascended. However, this interpretation was generally rejected, and according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, there was unanimous agreement among the scholars in denying the crucifixion.

<text>The Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (; CMRI) is a sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholic religious congregation. The CMRI is dedicated to promoting the message of Our Lady of Fátima and the devotion of the practice of Total Consecration to the Virgin Mary as taught by Saint Louis Marie de Montfort.

The CMRI holds that the Chair of St. Peter has been unoccupied since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958. The CMRI is not connected to the present Holy See or any territorial church diocese.

The congregation lists over 90 traditional Catholic churches and chapels both in the U.S. and abroad, as well as at least 13 schools staffed by religious.

== Names ==
The group had used and was designated by various names:

* Fatima Crusade
* Tridentine Latin Rite Church
* Oblates of Mary Immaculate
* Fatima Crusaders
* Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen

== Leadership==
=== Superiors Generals ===
*Francis Schuckardt (1967–1984)
*Denis Chicoine (1984–1989)
*Mark Pivarunas (1989–1991)
*Casimir M. Puskorius (1991–1995)
*Mark Pivarunas (1995–present)

==Activities==
The Sisters at Mt. St. Michael record CDs and perform an annual Christmas concert.

The CMRI hold the Fatima conference at Mt. St. Michael in Spokane, Washington in October each year. The conference includes five days of lectures, daily Mass, devotions, and meals.

The CMRI has been involved with mass media since their founding as a method of recruitment and information. Throughout their history, the CMRI has produced books, pamphlets, and audio recordings. The CMRI runs a bookstore (Mary Immaculate Queen Center) and produces various periodicals: The Reign of Mary (quarterly magazine), Adsum (Mater Dei seminary monthly newsletter), and Anima Mariae, the CMRI sisters&#x27; newsletter. The CMRI also produces annual CDs of the Fatima Conference talks, as well as providing a livestream of Daily Mass and devotions from the City of Mary in Rathdrum, Idaho.

==History==

===Speaking tours and Coeur d&#x27;Alene beginnings (1967 to 1971)===
Francis Konrad Maria Schuckardt (a Catholic layman from Seattle, Washington) and Robert Denis Chicoine (a former Marine, bricklayer, and newspaper pressman from New Bedford, Massachusetts) attracted their initial followers through international speaking tours as part of The Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima. Chicoine first heard Schuckardt in a 1965 talk in San Diego about the message of Fatima. After listening to Schuckardt for three nights in a row, he became his disciple.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Schuckardt was able to attract numerous vagabond priests.

Schuckardt was ordained a priest and consecrated a bishop by Daniel Quitler Brown from 28 October to 1 November 1971 at a motel in Chicago in front of 40 witnesses. Brown had been consecrated a bishop in 1969 by Hubert A. Rogers, a bishop of the North American Old Roman Catholic Church, but had left it and become independent in 1971.

The same year, Schuckardt changed the name of the group to Traditional Latin Rite Catholic Church.

=== Properties ===
The CMRI owned and operated numerous schools, camps, and properties, including a convent and girls high school in Colbert, Washington about north of Spokane, and a mansion located at 2314 E South Altamont Blvd in Spokane, Washington that operated as the priory and Schuckardt&#x27;s main residence.

===Chicoine era (1984 to 1989)===

On June 3, 1984, Schuckardt and a small group of his followers were expelled from the CMRI and left the Spokane area, taking the name Tridentine Latin Rite Church (TLRC). In addition to Alphonsus, Schuckardt was followed by 4 religious sisters and 10 religious clerics and brothers. A larger group of the priests, religious, and laity remained with Chicoine at Mt. St. Michael, retaining the CMRI name and the bulk of the church property. Chicoine accused Schuckardt of abuse and drug addiction. Local media in 1984 reported that there were 5000 followers of the group in the United States, 800 of whom live in the Spokane area. In 1986, local media reported that about half the members of the church&#x27;s religious orders left.

Following the expulsion of Schuckardt, sedevacantist Bishop George Musey (of the Thuc apostolic line) conditionally re-administered the sacraments imparted by Schuckardt, whose validity was now considered dubious, and conditionally re-ordained the remaining priests.

In 1986, the Congregation held its first General Chapter, which established its rule and constitutions, that were later approved by sedevacantist Bishop Robert McKenna .

=== Pivarunas era (1989 to present) ===
In August 1989, Father Tarcisius Pivarunas (Mark Pivarunas) was elected as the Superior General of the congregation.

On 1 February 1991, sedevacantist Bishop Moisés Carmona expressed his desire to consecrate as bishop whomever the congregation chooses. On 3 April 1991, Pivarunas was elected to be consecrated a bishop. In accordance with Catholic practice, Pivarunas discontinued the use of his religious name, &quot;Tarcisius&quot;, and in accordance with the CMRI Constitutions, resigned his post as the Superior General. He was succeeded by Father Casimir M. Puskorius. On 24 September 1991, in Mount Saint Michael, Pivarunas was consecrated a bishop by Bishop Carmona.

In June 2007, 15 sisters (including Rev. Mother Ludmilla) living at Mount Saint Michael in Spokane were expelled from the congregation because they had come to disagree with the congregation&#x27;s stance of sedevacantism. They later reconciled with the Catholic Church and formed the Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Church (SMMC) under the authority of William Skylstad, bishop of Spokane.

In 2016, Pivarunas administered the sacrament of confirmation to 20 people in Paese, during a Mass presided by Abrahamowicz. The Diocese of Treviso declared the confirmations to be &quot;valid but illicit&quot;.

<text>In linear algebra, the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is a polynomial which is invariant under matrix similarity and has the eigenvalues as roots. It has the determinant and the trace of the matrix among its coefficients. The characteristic polynomial of an endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of that endomorphism over any basis (that is, the characteristic polynomial does not depend on the choice of a basis). The characteristic equation, also known as the determinantal equation, is the equation obtained by equating the characteristic polynomial to zero.

In spectral graph theory, the characteristic polynomial of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix.

==Motivation==
In linear algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a fundamental role, since, given a linear transformation, an eigenvector is a vector whose direction is not changed by the transformation, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the measure of the resulting change of magnitude of the vector.

More precisely, suppose the transformation is represented by a square matrix formula_1 Then an eigenvector formula_2 and the corresponding eigenvalue formula_3 must satisfy the equation
formula_4
or, equivalently (since formula_5),
formula_6
where formula_7 is the identity matrix, and formula_8
(although the zero vector satisfies this equation for every formula_9 it is not considered an eigenvector). 

It follows that the matrix formula_10 must be singular, and its determinant
formula_11
must be zero.

In other words, the eigenvalues of are the roots of 
formula_12
which is a monic polynomial in of degree if is a matrix. This polynomial is the &quot;characteristic polynomial&quot; of .

==Formal definition==

Consider an formula_13 matrix formula_1 The characteristic polynomial of formula_15 denoted by formula_16 is the polynomial defined by
formula_17
where formula_7 denotes the formula_13 identity matrix.

Some authors define the characteristic polynomial to be formula_20 That polynomial differs from the one defined here by a sign formula_21 so it makes no difference for properties like having as roots the eigenvalues of formula_22; however the definition above always gives a monic polynomial, whereas the alternative definition is monic only when formula_23 is even.

==Examples==

To compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrix
formula_24
the determinant of the following is computed:
formula_25 
and found to be formula_26 the characteristic polynomial of formula_1

Another example uses hyperbolic functions of a hyperbolic angle φ.
For the matrix take
formula_28
Its characteristic polynomial is
formula_29

==Properties==

The characteristic polynomial formula_30 of a formula_13 matrix is monic (its leading coefficient is formula_32) and its degree is formula_33 The most important fact about the characteristic polynomial was already mentioned in the motivational paragraph: the eigenvalues of formula_22 are precisely the roots of formula_30 (this also holds for the minimal polynomial of formula_15 but its degree may be less than formula_23). All coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are polynomial expressions in the entries of the matrix. In particular its constant coefficient of formula_38 is formula_39 the coefficient of formula_40 is one, and the coefficient of formula_41 is , where is the trace of formula_1 (The signs given here correspond to the formal definition given in the previous section; for the alternative definition these would instead be formula_43 and respectively.)

For a formula_44 matrix formula_15 the characteristic polynomial is thus given by
formula_46

Using the language of exterior algebra, the characteristic polynomial of an formula_13 matrix formula_22 may be expressed as 
formula_49
where formula_50 is the trace of the formula_51th exterior power of formula_15 which has dimension formula_53 This trace may be computed as the sum of all principal minors of formula_22 of size formula_55 The recursive Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm computes these coefficients more efficiently.

When the characteristic of the field of the coefficients is formula_56 each such trace may alternatively be computed as a single determinant, that of the formula_57 matrix,
formula_58

The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that replacing formula_59 by formula_22 in the characteristic polynomial (interpreting the resulting powers as matrix powers, and the constant term formula_61 as formula_61 times the identity matrix) yields the zero matrix. Informally speaking, every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. This statement is equivalent to saying that the minimal polynomial of formula_22 divides the characteristic polynomial of formula_1

Two similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial. The converse however is not true in general: two matrices with the same characteristic polynomial need not be similar.

The matrix formula_22 and its transpose have the same characteristic polynomial. formula_22 is similar to a triangular matrix if and only if its characteristic polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors over formula_67 (the same is true with the minimal polynomial instead of the characteristic polynomial). In this case formula_22 is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal form.

==Characteristic polynomial of a product of two matrices==

If formula_22 and formula_70 are two square formula_13 matrices then characteristic polynomials of formula_72 and formula_73 coincide: 
formula_74

When formula_22 is non-singular this result follows from the fact that formula_72 and formula_73 are similar:
formula_78

For the case where both formula_22 and formula_70 are singular, the desired identity is an equality between polynomials in formula_59 and the coefficients of the matrices. Thus, to prove this equality, it suffices to prove that it is verified on a non-empty open subset (for the usual topology, or, more generally, for the Zariski topology) of the space of all the coefficients. As the non-singular matrices form such an open subset of the space of all matrices, this proves the result.

More generally, if formula_22 is a matrix of order formula_83 and formula_70 is a matrix of order formula_85 then formula_72 is formula_87 and formula_73 is formula_13 matrix, and one has
formula_90

To prove this, one may suppose formula_91 by exchanging, if needed, formula_22 and formula_93 Then, by bordering formula_22 on the bottom by formula_95 rows of zeros, and formula_70 on the right, by, formula_95 columns of zeros, one gets two formula_13 matrices formula_99 and formula_100 such that formula_101 and formula_102 is equal to formula_72 bordered by formula_95 rows and columns of zeros. The result follows from the case of square matrices, by comparing the characteristic polynomials of formula_102 and formula_106

==Characteristic polynomial of &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;==

If formula_3 is an eigenvalue of a square matrix formula_22 with eigenvector formula_109 then formula_110 is an eigenvalue of formula_111 because
formula_112

The multiplicities can be shown to agree as well, and this generalizes to any polynomial in place of formula_113:

That is, the algebraic multiplicity of formula_3 in formula_115 equals the sum of algebraic multiplicities of formula_116 in formula_22 over formula_116 such that formula_119 
In particular, formula_120 and formula_121 
Here a polynomial formula_122 for example, is evaluated on a matrix formula_22 simply as formula_124 

The theorem applies to matrices and polynomials over any field or commutative ring.
However, the assumption that formula_30 has a factorization into linear factors is not always true, unless the matrix is over an algebraically closed field such as the complex numbers.

==Secular function and secular equation==

===Secular function===

The term secular function has been used for what is now called &quot;characteristic polynomial&quot; (in some literature the term secular function is still used). The term comes from the fact that the characteristic polynomial was used to calculate secular perturbations (on a time scale of a century, that is, slow compared to annual motion) of planetary orbits, according to Lagrange&#x27;s theory of oscillations.

===Secular equation===
&quot;Secular equation&quot; may have several meanings.

* In linear algebra it is sometimes used in place of characteristic equation.
* In astronomy it is the algebraic or numerical expression of the magnitude of the inequalities in a planet&#x27;s motion that remain after the inequalities of a short period have been allowed for.

* In molecular orbital calculations relating to the energy of the electron and its wave function it is also used instead of the characteristic equation.

==For general associative algebras==
The above definition of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix formula_126 with entries in a field formula_127 generalizes without any changes to the case when formula_127 is just a commutative ring. defines the characteristic polynomial for elements of an arbitrary finite-dimensional (associative, but not necessarily commutative) algebra over a field formula_127 and proves the standard properties of the characteristic polynomial in this generality.

<doc id="218271" wikidata="Q1062803" url="?curid=218271" title="Omnipresence">
<text>Omnipresence or ubiquity is the property of being present anywhere and everywhere. The term omnipresence is most often used in a religious context as an attribute of a deity or supreme being, while the term ubiquity is generally used to describe something &quot;existing or being everywhere at the same time, constantly encountered, widespread, common&quot;. Ubiquitous is also used synonymously with other words, including: worldwide, universal, global, pervasive, and all over the place.

The omnipresence of a supreme being is conceived differently by different religious systems. In monotheistic beliefs like Islam Christianity and Judaism, the divine and the universe are separate, but the divine is in attributes present everywhere. In pantheistic beliefs, the divine and the universe are identical. In panentheistic beliefs, the divine interpenetrates the universe, but extends beyond it in time and space.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;omnipresence&quot; derives from the Latin prefix &quot;omni&quot;-, meaning &quot;all&quot;, and the words &quot;praesens&quot;, meaning &quot;present&quot;. Thus the term means &quot;all present&quot;.

==Introduction==
Hinduism, and other religions that derive from it, incorporate the theory of &quot;transcendent and immanent omnipresence&quot; which is the traditional meaning of the word, Brahman. This theory defines a universal and fundamental substance, which is the source of all physical existence.

Divine omnipresence is thus one of the divine attributes, although in Western Christianity it has attracted less philosophical attention than such attributes as omnipotence, omniscience, or being eternal.

In Western theism, omnipresence is roughly described as the ability to be &quot;present everywhere at the same time&quot;, referring to an unbounded or universal presence. Omnipresence means minimally that there is no place to which God’s knowledge and power do not extend. It is related to the concept of ubiquity, the ability to be everywhere or in many places at once. This includes unlimited temporal presence. 

William Lane Craig states that we shouldn’t think of God as being in space in the sense of being spread out like an invisible ether throughout space. He is not like an invisible gas that is everywhere present in space. This would be incorrect for several reasons. For one, it would mean that if the universe is finite, which is perfectly possible, then God would be finite. We do not want to say that because God is infinite. More seriously, if God is spread out throughout space, like an invisible ether, that means that he is not fully present everywhere. Craig argues that omnipresence is a derived characteristic: an omniscient and omnipotent deity knows everything and can be and act everywhere, simultaneously. Others propound a deity as having the &quot;Three O&#x27;s&quot;, including omnipresence as a unique characteristic of the deity. Most Christian denominations — following theology standardized by the Nicene Creed — explain the concept of omnipresence in the form of the &quot;Trinity&quot;, by having a single deity (God) made up of three omnipresent persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

==Omnipresence in religions==
Several ancient cultures, such as the Vedic and the Native American civilizations share similar views on omnipresent nature; the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans did not worship an omnipresent being. While most Paleolithic cultures followed polytheistic practices, a form of omnipresent deity arises from a worldview that does not share ideas with mono-local deity cultures. Some omnipresent religions see the whole of existence as a manifestation of the deity. There are two predominant viewpoints here: pantheism, the deity is the summation of Existence, and panentheism, the deity is an emergent property of existence. The first is closest to the Native Americans&#x27; worldview; the latter resembles the Vedic outlook.. However, ample evidence exists in Vedic texts showing omnipresence and immanent transcendence. In one such Vedic text, namely Isavasya Upanishad, from Shukla Yajur Veda Samhita, verses 40:1,5 clearly shows immanence and omnipresence, while verses 40:4,8 clearly establish transcendence with respect to matter, time and no limitations of any kind.

===Judaism===
The monotheist worldview of mainstream Judaism rejects the belief of panentheism and an omnipresent God. While the &quot;entire concept of God occupying physical space, or having any category of spatial reference apply to him was completely rejected by pure Judaic monotheism,&quot; Hasidic teachings, along with certain Kabbalistic systems, diverged to postulate belief in panentheism.

===Islam===
Islam, Shia, or Sunni do not believe in omnipresence.

In Athari Islam, Allah is above his throne, in the direction of aboveness, The Hanafi scholar Ibn Abi Al-ʻIzz said in Sharh At-Tahaawiyyah:

“The statements of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) about affirming the attribute of ʻuluww (aboveness, Allah being above his throne which is above the seventh heaven, therefore Allah is above everything) are many. For instance, Shaykhul-Islam Abu Ismaaʻeel Al-Ansaari said in his book Al-Farooq with a chain of narration up to Muteeʻ Al-Balkhi that he asked Abu Haneefah about the person who says, &#x27;I do not know whether my Lord is in the heaven or on the earth.&#x27; He (Abu Haneefah) said, &#x27;He has committed kufr (disbelief), because Allaah says (what means): {The Most Merciful (Who is) above the Throne established.} [Quran 20:5], and His Throne is above seven heavens.&#x27; He further asked Imaam Abu Haneefah, &#x27;What if he says, &#x27;He is above the Throne but I do not know whether the Throne is in the heaven or on the earth.&quot; Imaam Abu Haneefah replied, &#x27;He is kaafir (a disbeliever) because he denies that He is in the heaven. Whoever denies that He is in the heaven has committed kufr.&#x27; Another narrator added, &#x27;Because Allaah is above the highest heaven, and He is supplicated upwards not downwards (i.e. people raise their heads towards the heaven and stretch their hands upwards towards Allaah).&#x27;” [Sharh Al-ʻAqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah]

and the scholars of the Salaf, who are the source of Athari theology state:

Abu Nasr As-Sijzee Al-Hanafi (d. 444 H.) said in “Al-Ibanah”: “Our Imams such as Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Malik, Hammad bin Salamah, Hammad bin Zayd, Abdullah bin al-Mubarak, Al-Fudail bin `Iyad, Ahmad bin Hanbal, and Ishaq bin Rahwaih, are upon agreement that Allah –Subhanahu wa Ta`ala is by His Essence (bi-dhatihi) above the Throne, and His Knowledge is everywhere.”
In Ash&#x27;ari Islam, God has no body or direction and is not bound by space or time.

According to Shia tradition in Nahj al-Balagha, a compilation of Ali&#x27;s teachings and letters, with commentary by Morteza Motahhari, God is with everything, but not in anything, and nothing is with him. God is not within things, though not out of them. He is over and above every kind of condition, state, similarity, and likeness. Ali says about God&#x27;s omnipresence: 
* &quot;He is with everything but not in physical nearness. He is different from everything but not in physical separation.&quot; 
* “He is not inside things in the sense of physical [pervasion or] penetration and is not outside them in the sense of [physical] exclusion [for exclusion entails a kind of finitude].” 
* “He is distinct from things because He overpowers them, and the things are distinct from Him because of their subjection to Him.”
Sunnis however cite that those narrations lack any actual crediation or authentic isnad to Ali.

===Christianity===

In Christianity, as well as in Kabbalistic and Hasidic philosophy, God is omnipresent. However, the significant difference between them and other religious systems is that God is still transcendent to His creation and yet immanent in relating to creation. God is not immersed in the substance of creation, even though he can interact with it as he chooses. He can make his human-divine body visible anytime and everywhere, whatever he wants: he cannot be excluded from any location or object in creation. God&#x27;s presence is continuous throughout all of creation, though it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to people everywhere. At times, he may be actively present in a situation, while he may not indicate that he is present in another circumstance in some other area. God is omnipresent in a way that he can interact with his creation however he chooses and is the very essence of his creation. While contrary to ordinary physical intuitions, such omnipresence is logically possible by way of the classic geometric point or its equivalent, in that such a point is, by definition, within all of space without taking up any space. The Bible states that God can be both present to a person in a manifest manner (Psalm 46:1, Isaiah 57:15) as well as being present in every situation in all of creation at any given time (Psalm 33:13-14).

Specifically, Oden states that the Bible shows that God can be present in every aspect of human life:
* God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural order, in every level of causality, every fleeting moment, and meaningful event of natural history... (Psalm 8:3, Isaiah 40:12, Nahum 1:3)
*God is bodily present in the Incarnation (Christianity) of his Son, Jesus Christ. (Gospel of John 1:14, Colossians 2:9)
*God is sacredly present and becomes known in special places where God chooses to meet us, places that become set apart by the faithful remembering community (1 Corinthians 11:23-29) where it may say: &quot;Truly the Lord is in this place&quot;. (Genesis 28:16, Matthew 18:20)

Marbaniang points out that omnipresence does not mean divine occupation of all space, nor divine distribution overall space, nor indwelling of every entity, nor that God cannot move in space, nor the diversification of the universe, but means that God is fully present everywhere and that God can do different things at different places at the same time.

<doc id="218277" wikidata="Q3442504" url="?curid=218277" title="Rosemary Brown (Canadian politician)">
<text>Rosemary Brown (née Wedderburn; June 17, 1930 – April 26, 2003) was a Canadian politician. She was the first black woman elected to the provincial government of British Columbia.

==Early years==
Rosemary Brown was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1930. She came to Canada in the year 1951 to attend university. She proceeded to earn a Master of Social Work at the University of British Columbia. As a student at McGill, and later the University of British Columbia, she faced pervasive discrimination. It was through adversity that she found her purpose as a leader against racism and sexism. She helped to found the British Columbia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (BCAACP) in 1956 to help advocate for housing, employment and human rights legislation.

==Political history==
Brown served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the British Columbia legislature as a part of the New Democratic Party from 1972 to 1986, making her the first Black Canadian woman to be elected to a Canadian provincial legislature.

During that time, she advocated for Canadian minorities and changed the legislature to uphold equality. She worked on improving &quot;services for the elderly, the disadvantaged, immigrants and people with disabilities&quot; as well as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race or sex.

In 1975, she became the first black woman to run for the leadership of a Canadian federal party (and only the second woman, after Mary Walker-Sawka), finishing a strong second (with 40.1% of the votes on the fourth and final ballot) to Ed Broadbent in that year&#x27;s New Democratic Party leadership election.

After departing politics, she became a professor of women&#x27;s studies at Simon Fraser University. In 1993, she was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and served until 1996. In 1995, she was awarded the Order of British Columbia and in 1996 was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Brown was sworn to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada as a member of the Federal Security Intelligence Review Committee, responsible for overseeing the actions of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, a role which she held from 1993 to 1998. She also served on the Order of Canada Advisory Committee from 1999 until her death in 2003.

==Honours and awards==
* National Black Coalition Award, 1972
* United Nations Human Rights Fellowship, 1973
* YWCA Woman of Distinction Award, 1989
* Order of British Columbia, 1995 
* Order of Canada, 1996 
* Government of Jamaica Commander of the Order of Distinction, 2001
* Canadian Labour Congress Award for Outstanding Service to Humanity, 2002 
* 15 honorary doctorate degrees from Canadian Universities including UBC, 1995.

==Death==
She died of a heart attack aged 72, in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2003.

==Legacy==
Canada Post featured Brown on a Canadian postage stamp released on February 2, 2009.

On June 17, 2005, a park in Brown&#x27;s former provincial riding of Vancouver-Burrard was dedicated to and named for her.

In 2017, Vancouver city council voted to name a lane in Vancouver&#x27;s West End &quot;Rosemary Brown Lane.&quot;

In 2021 a new public school in the Durham District School board in Ontario was named Rosemary Brown Public School.

A recreation centre in Burnaby, British Columbia was named in honour of Brown &amp; was completed in April 2024. It is located on the corner of 10th Avenue and 18th Street. The 8,500 sq.m (92,000 sq.ft) recreation centre accommodates ice sports as well as lacrosse, ball hockey, inline hockey, community events and city-run activities. It also displays a public art piece, &quot;Gliding Edge&quot;, by local BC artist Jinn Anholt.

<text>John Edward Broadbent (March 21, 1936 – January 11, 2024) was a Canadian social-democratic politician and political scientist. He was leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) from 1975 to 1989, and a member of Parliament from 1968 to 1990 and from 2004 to 2006. He led the NDP through four federal elections. He oversaw a period of growth for the party with its parliamentary representation rising from 17 to 43 seats as of the 1988 federal election.

Broadbent also served as a vice-president of Socialist International from 1979 to 1989 and director of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development from 1990 to 1996. Returning to politics in the 2004 federal election, he was elected to represent Ottawa Centre. He later chaired the Broadbent Institute, a policy think tank founded in 2011.

==Early life==
John Edward Broadbent was born in Oshawa, Ontario, the son of Percy, who worked at General Motors, and Mary (Welsh) Broadbent, a homemaker.

In 1961, he married Yvonne Yamaoka, a Japanese Canadian town planner whose family had been interned by the federal government in World War II. They divorced in 1967.

Broadbent received a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in political science from the University of Toronto in 1966, with a thesis titled &quot;The Good Society of John Stuart Mill,&quot; under the supervision of C.B. Macpherson.

==Early political career (1968–1975)==
Broadbent was a university professor when he won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the riding of Oshawa—Whitby during the 1968 federal election. He defeated Progressive Conservative MP Michael Starr, a former cabinet minister (under John Diefenbaker) and acting leader of the opposition, by fifteen votes in a close three-way race. He began his parliamentary service in the 28th Canadian Parliament.

After Tommy Douglas retired from the leadership of the party, Broadbent stood to succeed him but was eliminated on the second ballot of the 1971 leadership convention; David Lewis became leader. In 1974, Lewis himself retired as leader, due to a disappointing electoral result for the NDP in that year&#x27;s federal election and ill health. Broadbent won the 1975 leadership election to succeed Lewis, going on to lead the party through four national elections.

==Leader of the NDP (1975–1989)==
In the 1979 federal election, the NDP under Broadbent boosted their seat count from 17 to 26 seats. In the 1980 election nine months later, Broadbent&#x27;s NDP again experienced a boost of support from 27 to 32 seats. Following the election, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau approached Broadbent about the possibility of forming a coalition government even though his Liberals had just won a working majority government. Broadbent declined Trudeau&#x27;s offer.

In the 1984 federal election, the NDP finished with 30 seats, just ten behind the Liberal Party led by John Turner.

After the election, Broadbent&#x27;s personal popularity was consistently in first place among the leaders of federal parties. In 1987, he became the first NDP leader who took the party to first place in public opinion polling since it was founded. Some pundits predicted that the NDP could supplant Turner&#x27;s Liberals as the primary opposition to the Brian Mulroney-led Progressive Conservatives. Like Turner, Broadbent supported Mulroney&#x27;s proposed Meech Lake Accord (which proposed recognizing Quebec as a distinct society and extending provincial powers), which led to some dissent within the NDP.

In the 1988 federal election, the NDP under Broadbent won 43 seats, a record unchallenged until the 2011 federal election, when it won 103 seats. Despite the polling milestones prior to the election, the NDP was not successful in translating this into a major breakthrough, as they remained in third place (behind the second-place Liberals). Broadbent gained criticism for not making the NDP&#x27;s opposition to the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement the main issue during the campaign, as the Liberals reaped most of the benefits from opposing the agreement.

On the international front, Broadbent served as a vice-president of Socialist International from 1979 to 1989, during which time Willy Brandt, the former chancellor of West Germany, was its president.

Broadbent stepped down after 14 and a half years as leader of the federal NDP at the 1989 Winnipeg Convention, when he was succeeded by Audrey McLaughlin. He also resigned his Oshawa seat in the House of Commons that year. The 1990 Oshawa federal by-election was held for the NDP by Michael Breaugh.

==Post-leadership (1989–2004)==
In the decade following Broadbent&#x27;s retirement from politics, the federal NDP declined in popularity. The party would not come close to the popularity that it had enjoyed under Broadbent until Jack Layton took over the leadership in 2003.

Broadbent was director of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development from 1990 to 1996. In 1993, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2001.

Broadbent spent a year as Fellow at All Souls College, University of Oxford, in 1996–1997.

==Member of Parliament (2004–2006)==
At Layton&#x27;s invitation, Broadbent returned to politics in 2004. With the aid of a humorous and popular video clip, he successfully ran for Parliament in the riding of Ottawa Centre, where he lived later in life. He defeated the Liberal candidate, Richard J. Mahoney, a close ally of Prime Minister Paul Martin. In the NDP shadow cabinet, Broadbent was Critic for Democracy: Parliamentary &amp; Electoral Reform, Corporate Accountability as well as Child Poverty. On May 4, 2005, he announced that he would not seek re-election in the 39th federal election so that he could spend time with his wife, Lucille, who was suffering from cancer. She died on November 17, 2006.

==After politics==
In November 2008, Broadbent and former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien came out of retirement to help to negotiate a formal coalition agreement between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party, which the Bloc Québécois would support. It was to replace the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and would have been the first coalition government in Canada since World War I, when Robert Borden governed as a Unionist. The idea died after Michaëlle Jean, the Governor General of Canada, prorogued Parliament in December 2008 at Harper&#x27;s request.

Broadbent announced the creation of the Broadbent Institute on June 17, 2011, to explore social-democratic policy and ideas. It provides a vehicle for social-democratic and progressive academics, provides education, and trains activists. It is independent of the New Democratic Party. Three months later, he endorsed Brian Topp in his unsuccessful campaign during the 2012 leadership election.

In 2017, Broadbent voiced his support for the campaign for the establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organization that advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. Five years later, he published &quot;Seeking Social Democracy&quot;, a detailed reflection on his life and career, co-authored with academic Francis Abele, policy strategist Jonathan Sas, and journalist Luke Savage.

Until his death, he was a fellow in the School of Policy Studies at Queen&#x27;s University.

==Personal life==
In 1971, Broadbent married a young Franco-Ontarian widow, Lucille Munroe. Munroe died of cancer on November 17, 2006, at the age of 71. Broadbent married the Marxist historian and political theorist Ellen Meiksins Wood, an old friend, in 2014. She was a political theorist and socialist historian, author of several books, and a professor at York University for three decades. She died of cancer at the couple&#x27;s Ottawa home at 73 in January 2016.

Broadbent died on January 11, 2024, at the age of 87. His state funeral on January 28 at Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre in Ottawa was the first Canadian state funeral for a party leader who was never prime minister nor leader of the official opposition.

<doc id="218283" wikidata="Q166663" url="?curid=218283" title="Bonar Law">
<text>Andrew Bonar Law (; 16 September 1858 – 30 October 1923) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1922 to May 1923.

Law was born in the British colony of New Brunswick (now a Canadian province). He was of Scottish and Ulster Scots descent and moved to Scotland in 1870. He left school aged sixteen to work in the iron industry, becoming a wealthy man by the age of thirty. He entered the House of Commons at the 1900 general election, relatively late in life for a front-rank politician; he was made a junior minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, in 1902. Law joined the Shadow Cabinet in opposition after the 1906 general election. In 1911, he was appointed a Privy Councillor, before standing for the vacant party leadership. Despite never having served in the Cabinet and despite trailing third after Walter Long and Austen Chamberlain, Law became leader when the two front-runners withdrew rather than risk a draw splitting the party.

As Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition, Law focused his attentions in favour of tariff reform and against Irish Home Rule. His campaigning helped turn Liberal attempts to pass the Third Home Rule Bill into a three-year struggle eventually halted by the start of World War I, with much argument over the status of the six counties in Ulster which would later become Northern Ireland, four of which were predominantly Protestant.

Law first held Cabinet office as Secretary of State for the Colonies in H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Coalition Government (May 1915 – December 1916). Upon Asquith&#x27;s fall from power he declined to form a government, instead he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in David Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition Government. He resigned on grounds of ill health early in 1921. In October 1922, with Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition having become unpopular with the Conservatives, he wrote a letter to the press giving only lukewarm support to the Government&#x27;s actions over Chanak. After Conservative MPs voted to end the Coalition, he again became party leader and, this time, prime minister. Bonar Law won a clear majority at the 1922 general election, and his brief premiership saw negotiation with the United States over Britain&#x27;s war loans. Seriously ill with throat cancer, Law resigned in May 1923, and died later that year. He was the fourth shortest-serving prime minister of the United Kingdom (211 days in office).

==Early life and education==

Andrew Bonar Law was born on 16 September 1858 in Kingston (now Five Rivers), New Brunswick, to the Reverend James Law, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife Eliza Kidston Law. He was of Scottish and Irish (mainly Ulster Scots) ancestry. At the time of his birth, New Brunswick was still a separate colony, as the Canadian Confederation was not formed until 1867.

His mother originally wanted to name him after Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne, a preacher she greatly admired, but as his older brother was already called Robert, he was instead named after Andrew Bonar, a biographer of M&#x27;Cheyne. Throughout his life he was always called Bonar by his family and close friends, never Andrew. He originally signed his name as A. B. Law, changing to A. Bonar Law in his thirties. He was referred to as Bonar Law by the public.

James Law was the minister for several isolated townships, and had to travel between them by horse, boat and on foot. To supplement the family income, he bought a small farm on the Richibucto River, which Bonar helped tend along with his brothers Robert, William and John, and his sister Mary. Studying at the local village school, Law did well at his studies, and it is here that he was first noted for his excellent memory. After Eliza Law died in 1861, her sister Janet travelled to New Brunswick from her home in Scotland to look after the Law children. When James Law remarried in 1870, his new wife took over Janet&#x27;s duties, and Janet decided to return home to Scotland. She suggested that Bonar Law should go with her, as the Kidston family were wealthier and better connected than the Laws, and Bonar would have a more privileged upbringing. Both James and Bonar accepted this, Bonar&#x27;s father then accompanied him on his move to his aunt&#x27;s. Bonar would never return to Kingston.

Law went to live at Janet&#x27;s house in Helensburgh, near Glasgow. Her brothers Charles, Richard and William were partners in the family merchant bank Kidston &amp; Sons, and as only one of them had married (and produced no heir) it was generally accepted that Law would inherit the firm, or at least play a role in its management when he was older. Immediately upon arriving from Kingston, Law began attending Gilbertfield House School, a preparatory school in Hamilton. In 1873, aged fourteen, he transferred to the High School of Glasgow, where with his good memory he showed a talent for languages, excelling in Greek, German and French. During this period, he first began to play chess – he would carry a board on the train between Helensburgh and Glasgow, challenging other commuters to matches. He eventually became a very good amateur player, and competed with internationally renowned chess masters. Despite his good academic record, it became obvious at Glasgow that he was better suited to business than to university, and when he was sixteen, Law left school to become a clerk at Kidston &amp; Sons.

==Business career==

At Kidston &amp; Sons, Law received a nominal salary, on the understanding that he would gain a &quot;commercial education&quot; from working there that would serve him well as a businessman. In 1885 the Kidston brothers decided to retire, and agreed to merge the firm with the Clydesdale Bank.

The merger would have left Law without a job and with poor career-prospects, but the retiring brothers found him a job with William Jacks, an iron merchant who had started pursuing a parliamentary career. The Kidston brothers lent Law the money to buy a partnership in Jacks&#x27; firm, and with Jacks himself no longer playing an active part in the company, Law effectively became the managing partner. Working long hours (and insisting that his employees did likewise), Law turned the firm into one of the most profitable iron merchants in the Glaswegian and Scottish markets.

During this period Law became a &quot;self-improver&quot;; despite his lack of formal university education, Law sought to test his intellect, attending lectures given at Glasgow University and joining the Glasgow Parliamentary Debating Association, which adhered as closely as possible to the layout of the real Parliament of the United Kingdom. This helped Law hone the skills that served him so well in the political arena.

By the time he was thirty, Law had established himself as a successful businessman. He had time to devote to more leisurely pursuits. He remained an avid chess player, whom Andrew Harley called &quot;a strong player, touching first-class amateur level, which he had attained by practice at the Glasgow Club in earlier days&quot;. Law also worked with the Parliamentary Debating Association, and took up golf, tennis and walking. In 1888 he moved out of the Kidston household and set up his own home at Seabank, with his sister Mary (who had earlier come over from Canada) acting as the housekeeper.

In 1890, Law met Annie Pitcairn Robley, the 24-year-old daughter of a Glaswegian merchant, Harrington Robley. They quickly fell in love, and married on 24 March 1891. Little is known of Law&#x27;s wife, as most of her letters have been lost. It is known that she was much liked in both Glasgow and London, and that her death in 1909 hit Law hard; despite his relatively young age and prosperous career, he never remarried. The couple had six children: James Kidston (1893–1917), Isabel Harrington (1895–1969), Charles John (1897–1917), Harrington (1899–1958), Richard Kidston (1901–1980), and Catherine Edith (1905–1992).

Law&#x27;s second son, Charlie, a lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, was killed at the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917. His eldest son, James, a captain in the Royal Fusiliers, was shot down and killed on 21 September 1917. The deaths made Law even more melancholy and depressed than before. The youngest son, Richard, later served as a Conservative MP and minister. Isabel married Sir Frederick Sykes (in the early years of World War I, she had been engaged for a time to the Australian war correspondent Keith Murdoch) and Catherine married, firstly, Kent Colwell and, much later, in 1961, The 1st Baron Archibald.

==Entry into politics==

In 1897, Law was asked to become the Conservative Party candidate for the parliamentary seat of Glasgow Bridgeton. Soon after he was offered another seat, this one in Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown, which he took instead of Glasgow Bridgeton. Blackfriars was not a seat with high prospects attached; a working-class area, it had returned Liberal Party MPs since it was created in 1884, and the incumbent, Andrew Provand, was highly popular. Although the election was not due until 1902, the events of the Second Boer War forced the Conservative government to call a general election in 1900, later known as the khaki election. The campaign was unpleasant for both sides, with anti- and pro-war campaigners fighting vociferously, but Law distinguished himself with his oratory and wit. When the results came in on 4 October, Law was returned to Parliament with a majority of 1,000, overturning Provand&#x27;s majority of 381. He immediately ended his active work at Jacks and Company (although he retained his directorship) and moved to London.

Law initially became frustrated with the slow speed of Parliament compared to the rapid pace of the Glasgow iron market, and Austen Chamberlain recalled him saying to Chamberlain that &quot;it was very well for men who, like myself had been able to enter the House of Commons young to adapt to a Parliamentary career, but if he had known what the House of Commons was he would never had entered at this stage&quot;. He soon learnt to be patient, however, and on 18 February 1901 made his maiden speech. Replying to anti-Boer War MPs, including David Lloyd George, Law used his excellent memory to quote sections of Hansard back to the opposition. These sections contained their previous speeches which supported and commended the policies which they now denounced. Although lasting only fifteen minutes and not a crowd- or press-pleaser (like the maiden speeches of F. E. Smith or Winston Churchill), his speech attracted the attention of the Conservative Party leaders.

==Tariff reform==

Law&#x27;s chance to make his mark came with the issue of tariff reform. To cover the costs of the Second Boer War, Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Chancellor of the Exchequer (Michael Hicks Beach) suggested introducing import taxes or tariffs on foreign metal, flour and grain coming into Britain. Such tariffs had previously existed in Britain, but the last of these had been abolished in the 1870s because of the free trade movement. A duty was now introduced on imported corn. The issue became &quot;explosive&quot;, dividing the British political world, and continued even after Salisbury retired and was replaced as prime minister by his nephew, Arthur Balfour.

Law took advantage of this, making his first major speech on 22 April 1902, in which he argued that while he felt a general tariff was unnecessary, an imperial customs union (which would put tariffs on items from outside the British Empire, instead of on every nation but Britain) was a good idea, particularly since other nations such as (Germany) and the United States had increasingly high tariffs. Using his business experience, he made a &quot;plausible case&quot; that there was no proof that tariffs led to increases in the cost of living, as the Liberals had argued. Again his memory came into good use – when William Harcourt accused Law of misquoting him, Law was able to precisely give the place in Hansard where Harcourt&#x27;s speech was to be found.

As a result of Law&#x27;s proven experience in business matters and his skill as an economic spokesman for the government, Balfour offered him the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade when he formed his government, which Law accepted, and he was formally appointed on 11 August 1902.

As Parliamentary Secretary his job was to assist the President of the Board of Trade, Gerald Balfour. At the time the tariff reform controversy was brewing, led by the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, an ardent tariff reformer who &quot;declared war&quot; on free trade, and who persuaded the Cabinet that the Empire should be exempted from the new corn duty. After returning from a speaking tour of South Africa in 1903, Chamberlain found that the new Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. T. Ritchie) had instead abolished Hicks Beach&#x27;s corn duty altogether in his budget. Angered by this, Chamberlain spoke at the Birmingham Town Hall on 15 May without the government&#x27;s permission, arguing for an Empire-wide system of tariffs which would protect Imperial economies, forge the British Empire into one political entity and allow them to compete with other world powers.

The speech and its ideas split the Conservative Party and its coalition ally the Liberal Unionist Party into two wings – the Free Fooders, who supported free trade, and the Tariff Reformers, who supported Chamberlain&#x27;s tariff reforms. Law was a dedicated Tariff Reformer, but whereas Chamberlain dreamed of a new golden age for Britain, Law focused on more mundane and practical goals, such as a reduction in unemployment. L. S. Amery said that to Law, the tariff reform programme was &quot;a question of trade figures and not national and Imperial policy of expansion and consolidation of which trade was merely the economic factor&quot;. Keith Laybourn attributes Law&#x27;s interest in tariff reform not only to the sound business practice that it represented but also that because of his place of birth &quot;he was attracted by the Imperial tariff preference arrangements advocated by Joseph Chamberlain&quot;. Law&#x27;s constituents in Blackfriars were not overly enthusiastic about tariff reform – Glasgow was a poor area at the time that had benefited from free trade.

In parliament, Law worked exceedingly hard at pushing for tariff reform, regularly speaking in the House of Commons and defeating legendary debaters such as Winston Churchill, Charles Dilke and H. H. Asquith, former home secretary and later prime minister. His speeches at the time were known for their clarity and common sense; Sir Ian Malcolm said that he made &quot;the involved seem intelligible&quot;, and L. S. Amery said his arguments were &quot;like the hammering of a skilled riveter, every blow hitting the nail on the head&quot;. Despite Law&#x27;s efforts to forge consensus within the Conservatives, Balfour was unable to hold the two sides of his party together, and resigned as prime minister in December 1905, allowing the Liberals to form a government.

===In opposition===

The new prime minister, the Liberal Henry Campbell-Bannerman, immediately dissolved Parliament. Despite strong campaigning and a visit by Arthur Balfour, Law lost his seat in the ensuing general election. In total the Conservative Party and Liberal Unionists lost 245 seats, leaving them with only 157 members of parliament, the majority of them tariff reformers. Despite his loss, Law was at this stage such an asset to the Conservatives that an immediate effort was made to get him back into Parliament. The retirement of Frederick Rutherfoord Harris, MP for the safe Conservative seat of Dulwich, offered him a chance. Law was returned to Parliament in the ensuing by-election, increasing the Conservative majority to 1,279.

The party was struck a blow in July 1906, when two days after a celebration of his seventieth birthday, Joseph Chamberlain suffered a stroke and was forced to retire from public life. He was succeeded as leader of the tariff reformers by his son Austen Chamberlain, who despite previous experience as Chancellor of the Exchequer and enthusiasm for tariff reform was not as skilled a speaker as Law. As a result, Law joined Balfour&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as the principal spokesman for tariff reform. The death of Law&#x27;s wife on 31 October 1909 led him to work even harder, treating his political career not only as a job but as a coping strategy for his loneliness.

====The People&#x27;s Budget and the House of Lords====

Campbell-Bannerman resigned as prime minister in April 1908 and was replaced by H. H. Asquith. In 1909, he and his Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George introduced the People&#x27;s Budget, which sought through increased direct and indirect taxes to redistribute wealth and fund social reform programmes. By parliamentary convention, financial and budget bills are not challenged by the House of Lords. But in this case, the predominantly Conservative and Liberal Unionist Lords rejected the bill on 30 April, setting off a constitutional crisis.

The Liberals called a general election for January 1910, and Law spent most of the preceding months campaigning up and down the country for other Unionist candidates and MPs, sure that his Dulwich seat was safe. He obtained an increased majority of 2,418. The overall result was more confused: the Conservatives gained 116 seats, bringing their total to 273, but this was still less than the Liberal caucus, and produced a hung parliament, as neither had a majority of the seats (the Irish Parliamentary Party, the Labour Party and the All-for-Ireland League took more than 120 seats in total). The Liberals remained in office with the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party. The Budget passed through the House of Commons a second time, and – as it now had an electoral mandate – was then approved by the House of Lords without a division.

However, the crisis over the Budget had highlighted a long-standing constitutional question: should the House of Lords be able to overturn bills passed by the House of Commons? The Liberal government introduced a bill in February 1910 which would prevent the House of Lords vetoing finance bills, and would force them to pass any bill which had been passed by the Commons in three sessions of Parliament.

This was immediately opposed by the Unionists, and both parties spent the next several months in a running battle over the bill. The Conservatives were led by Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne, who headed the Conservatives in the House of Lords, while Law spent the time concentrating on the continuing problem of tariff reform. The lack of progress had convinced some senior Unionists that it would be a good idea to scrap tariff reform altogether. Law disagreed, successfully arguing that tariff reform &quot;was the first constructive work of the [Conservative Party]&quot; and that to scrap it would &quot;split the Party from top to bottom&quot;.

With this success, Law returned to the constitutional crisis surrounding the House of Lords. The death of King Edward VII on 6 May 1910 prompted the leaders of the major political parties to meet secretly in a &quot;Truce of God&quot; to discuss the Lords. The meetings were kept almost entirely secret: apart from the party representatives, the only people aware were F. E. Smith, J. L. Garvin, Edward Carson and Law. The group met about twenty times at Buckingham Palace between June and November 1910, with the Unionists represented by Arthur Balfour, Lord Cawdor, Lord Lansdowne and Austen Chamberlain. The proposal presented at the conference by David Lloyd George was a coalition government with members of both major parties in the Cabinet and a programme involving Home Rule, Poor Law reforms, imperial reorganisation and possibly tariff reforms. The Home Rule proposal would have made the United Kingdom a federation, with &quot;Home Rule All Round&quot; for Scotland, Ireland, and England and Wales. In the end the plans fell through: Balfour told Lloyd George on 2 November that the proposal would not work, and the conference was dissolved a few days later.

====December 1910 general election====

With the failure to establish a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of the popularity of the tariff reform programme would be to have a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried about the effect of a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform policy should be put in their manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others at a meeting of the Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to reach a consensus and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued to be something that divided the party.

During the constitutional talks the Conservatives had demanded that, if the Lords&#x27; veto were removed, Irish Home Rule should only be permitted if approved by a UK-wide referendum. In response Lord Crewe, Liberal Leader in the Lords, had suggested sarcastically that tariff reform – a policy of questionable popularity because of the likelihood of increased prices on imported food – should also be submitted to a referendum. Arthur Balfour now announced to a crowd of 10,000 at the Royal Albert Hall that after the coming election, a Conservative Government would indeed submit tariff reform to a referendum, something he described as &quot;Bonar Law&#x27;s proposal&quot; or the &quot;Referendum Pledge&quot;. The suggestion was no more Law&#x27;s than it was any of the dozens of Conservatives who had suggested this to Balfour, and his comment was simply an attempt to &quot;pass the buck&quot; and avoid the anger of Austen Chamberlain, who was furious that such an announcement had been made without consulting him or the party. While Law had written a letter to Balfour suggesting that a referendum would attract wealthy Conservatives, he said that &quot;declaration would do no good with [the working class] and might damp enthusiasm of best workers&quot;.

Parliament was dissolved on 28 November, with the election to take place and polling to end by 19 December. The Conservative and Liberal parties were equal in strength, and with the continued support of the Irish Nationalists the Liberal Party remained in government. Law called his campaign in Manchester North West the hardest of his career; his opponent, George Kemp, was a war hero who had fought in the Second Boer War and a former Conservative who had joined the Liberal party because of his disagreement with tariff reform.

In the end, Law narrowly lost, with 5,114 votes to Kemp&#x27;s 5,559, but the election turned him into a &quot;genuine [Conservative] hero&quot;, and he later said that the defeat did &quot;more for him in the party than a hundred victories&quot;. In 1911, with the Conservative Party unable to afford him being out of Parliament, Law was elected in a March 1911 by-election for the safe Conservative seat of Bootle. The Liberal attempt to curb the veto power of the House of Lords was now backed by a threat, if necessary, to create hundreds of Liberal peers. Law favoured surrender on pragmatic grounds, as a Unionist-dominated House of Lords would retain some ability to delay Liberal attempts to introduce Irish Home Rule, Welsh Disestablishment or electoral reforms gerrymandered to help the Liberal Party. In August 1911 enough Unionist peers abstained or voted in favour of the Liberal bill for it to pass as the Parliament Act 1911, ending that particular dispute.

==Leader of the Conservative Party==

On the coronation of George V on 22 June 1911, Law was appointed as a Privy Councillor on the recommendation of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and Arthur Balfour. This was evidence of his seniority and importance within the Conservative Party. Balfour had become increasingly unpopular as Leader of the Conservative Party since the 1906 general election; tariff reformers saw his leadership as the reason for their electoral losses, and the &quot;free fooders&quot; had been alienated by Balfour&#x27;s attempts to tame the zeal of the tariff reform faction. Balfour refused all suggestions of party reorganisation, until a meeting of senior Conservatives led by Lord Salisbury after the December 1910 electoral defeat issued an ultimatum demanding a review of party structure.

The defeat on the House of Lords issue turned a wing of the Conservative Party led by Henry Page Croft and his Reveille Movement, against Balfour. Leo Maxse began a Balfour Must Go campaign in his newspaper, the &quot;National Review&quot;, and by July 1911 Balfour was contemplating resignation. Law himself had no problem with Balfour&#x27;s leadership, and along with Edward Carson attempted to regain support for him. By November 1911 it was accepted that Balfour was likely to resign, with the main competitors for the leadership being Law, Carson, Walter Long and Austen Chamberlain. When the elections began, Long and Chamberlain were the frontrunners; Chamberlain commanded the support of many tariff reformers, and Long that of the Irish Unionists. Carson immediately announced that he would not stand, and Law eventually announced that he would run for Leader, the day before Balfour resigned on 7 November.

At the beginning of the election Law held the support of no more than 40 of the 270 members of parliament; the remaining 230 were divided between Long and Chamberlain. Although Long believed he had the most MPs, his support was largely amongst backbenchers, and most of the whips and frontbenchers preferred Chamberlain.

With Long and Chamberlain almost neck-and-neck they called a meeting on 9 November to discuss the possibility of a deadlock. Chamberlain suggested that he would withdraw if this became a strong possibility, assuming Long did the same. Long, now concerned that his weak health would not allow him to survive the stress of party leadership, agreed. Both withdrew on 10 November, and on 13 November 232 MPs assembled at the Carlton Club, and Law was nominated as leader by Long and Chamberlain. With the unanimous support of the MPs, Law became Leader of the Conservative Party despite never having sat in Cabinet. Law&#x27;s biographer, Robert Blake, wrote that he was an unusual choice to lead the Conservatives as a Presbyterian Canadian-Scots businessman had just become the leader of &quot;the Party of Old England, the Party of the Anglican Church and the country squire, the party of broad acres and hereditary titles&quot;.

As leader, Law first &quot;rejuvenated the party machine&quot;, selecting newer, younger and more popular whips and secretaries, elevating F. E. Smith and Lord Robert Cecil to the Shadow Cabinet and using his business acumen to reorganise the party, resulting in better relations with the press and local branches, along with the raising of a £671,000 &quot;war chest&quot; for the next general election: almost double that available at the previous one.

On 12 February 1912, he finally unified the two Unionist parties (Conservatives and Liberal Unionists) into the awkwardly named National Unionist Association of Conservative and Liberal-Unionist Organisations. From then on all were referred to as &quot;Unionists&quot; until the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922, after which they became Conservatives again (though the name &quot;Unionist&quot; continued in use in Scotland and Northern Ireland).

In Parliament, Law introduced the so-called &quot;new style&quot; of speaking, with harsh, accusatory rhetoric, which dominates British politics to this day. This was as a counter to Arthur Balfour, known for his &quot;masterly witticisms&quot;, because the party felt they needed a warrior-like figure. Law did not particularly enjoy his tougher manner, and at the State Opening of Parliament in February 1912 apologised directly to Asquith for his coming speech, saying, &quot;I am afraid I shall have to show myself very vicious, Mr Asquith, this session. I hope you will understand.&quot; Law&#x27;s &quot;warrior king&quot; figure helped unify the divided Conservatives into a single body, with him as the leader.

===Social policy===

During his early time as Conservative leader, the party&#x27;s social policy was the most complicated and difficult to agree. In his opening speech as leader he said that the party would be one of principle, and would not be reactionary, instead sticking to their guns and holding firm policies. Despite this he left women&#x27;s suffrage alone, leaving the party unwhipped and saying that &quot;the less part we take in this question the better&quot;. In terms of social reform (legislation to improve the conditions of the poor and working classes) Law was similarly unenthusiastic, believing that the area was a Liberal one, in which they could not successfully compete. His response to a request by Lord Balcarres for a social programme was simply &quot;As the [Liberal Party] refuse to formulate their policy in advance we should be equally absolved&quot;. His refusal to get drawn in may have actually strengthened his hold over Conservative MPs, many of whom were similarly uninterested in social reform.

In his first public speech as leader at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 January 1912 he listed his three biggest concerns: an attack on the Liberal government for failing to submit Home Rule to a referendum; tariff reform; and the Conservative refusal to let the Ulster Unionists be &quot;trampled upon&quot; by an unfair Home Rule bill. Both tariff reform and Ulster dominated his political work, with Austen Chamberlain saying that Law &quot;once said to me that he cared intensely for only two things: Tariff Reform and Ulster; all the rest was only part of the game&quot;.

===More tariff reform===

After further review with members of his party, Law changed his initial beliefs on tariff reform and accepted the full package, including duties on foodstuffs. On 29 February 1912 the entire Conservative parliamentary body (i.e. both MPs and peers) met at Lansdowne House, with Lord Lansdowne chairing. Lansdowne argued that although the electorate might prefer the Conservative Party if they dropped food duties from their tariff reform plan, it would open them to accusations of bad faith and &quot;poltroonery&quot;. Law endorsed Lansdowne&#x27;s argument, pointing out that any attempt to avoid food duties would cause an internal party struggle and could only aid the Liberals, and that Canada, the most economically important colony and a major exporter of foodstuffs, would never agree to tariffs without British support of food duties.

Lord Salisbury, who opposed food duties, wrote to Law several weeks later suggesting they separate foodstuffs from tariff reform for the referendum. If the electorate liked food duties, they would vote for the entire package; if not, they did not have to. Law replied arguing that it would be impossible to do so effectively, and that with the increasing costs of defence and social programmes it would be impossible to raise the necessary capital except by comprehensive tariff reform. He argued that a failure to offer the entire tariff reform package would split the Conservative Party down the middle, offending the tariff reform faction, and that if such a split took place &quot;I could not possibly continue as leader&quot;.

Law postponed withdrawing the tariff reform &quot;Referendum Pledge&quot; because of the visit of Robert Borden, the newly elected Conservative prime minister of Canada, to London planned for July 1912. Meeting with Borden on his arrival, Law got him to agree to make a statement about the necessity of Imperial tariff reform, promising reciprocal agreements and saying that failure by London to agree tariff reform would result in an &quot;irresistible pressure&quot; for Canada to make a treaty with another nation, most obviously the United States.

Law decided that the November party conference was the perfect time to announce the withdrawal of the Referendum Pledge, and that Lord Lansdowne should do it, because he had been leader in the House of Lords when the pledge was made and because of his relatively low profile during the original tariff reform dispute. When the conference opened the British political world was febrile; on 12 November the opposition had narrowly defeated the government on an amendment to the Home Rule Bill, and the next evening, amidst hysterical shouting from the opposition, Asquith attempted to introduce a motion reversing the previous vote. As the MPs filed out at the end of the day, Winston Churchill began taunting the opposition, and in his anger Ronald McNeil hurled a copy of &quot;Standing Orders of the House&quot; at Churchill, hitting him on the head. Law refused to condemn the events, and it seems apparent that while he had played no part in organising them, they &quot;had&quot; been planned by the party whips. As party leader, he was most likely aware of the plans even if he did not actively participate.

The conference was opened on 14 November 1912 by Lord Farquhar, who immediately introduced Lord Lansdowne. Lansdowne revoked the Referendum Pledge, saying that as the government had failed to submit Home Rule to a referendum, the offer that tariff reform would also be submitted was null and void. Lansdowne promised that when the Unionists took office they would &quot;do so with a free hand to deal with tariffs as they saw fit&quot;. Law then rose to speak, and in line with his agreement to let Lansdowne speak for tariff reform mentioned it only briefly when he said &quot;I concur in every word which has fallen from Lord Lansdowne&quot;. He instead promised a reversal of several Liberal policies when the Unionists came to power, including the disestablishment of the Welsh Church, land taxes, and Irish Home Rule. The crowd &quot;cheered themselves hoarse&quot; at Law&#x27;s speech.

However, the reaction from the party outside the conference hall was not a positive one. Law had not consulted the local constituency branches about his plan, and several important constituency leaders led by Archibald Salvidge and Lord Derby planned for a meeting of the Lancashire party, the centre of discontent, on 21 December. Law was preoccupied with the problem of Irish Home Rule and was unable to give the discontent his full attention. He continued to believe that his approach to the problem of tariff reform was the correct one, and wrote to John Strachey on 16 November saying that &quot;it was a case of a choice of two evils, and all that one could do was to take the lesser of the two, and that I am sure we have done&quot;. Speaking to Edward Carson, F.E. Smith, Austen Chamberlain and Lord Balcarres in December after two weeks of receiving negative letters from party members about the change, Law outlined that he would not be averse to a return to the previous policy considering the negative feelings from the party, but felt that this would require the resignation of both himself and Lansdowne.

Law again wrote to Strachey saying that he continued to feel this policy was the correct one, and only regretted that the issue was splitting the party at a time when unity was needed to fight the Home Rule problem. At the meeting of the Lancashire party the group under Derby condemned Law&#x27;s actions and called for a three-week party recess before deciding what to do about the repeal of the Referendum Pledge. This was an obvious ultimatum to Law, giving him a three-week period to change his mind. Law believed that Derby was &quot;unprincipled and treacherous&quot;, particularly since he then circulated a questionnaire among Lancashire party members with leading questions such as &quot;do you think the abandonment of the referendum will do harm?&quot; Law met the Lancashire party on 2 January 1913 and ordered that they must replace any food tariff based resolutions with a vote of confidence in him as a leader, and that any alternative would result in his resignation.

After a chance meeting at which Edward Carson learnt of Law and Lansdowne&#x27;s acceptance of possible resignation, he was spurred to ask Edward Goulding to beg Law and Lansdowne to compromise over the policy and remain as leaders. The compromise, known as the January Memorial, was agreed by Carson, James Craig, Law and Lansdowne at Law&#x27;s house between 6–8 January 1913, affirming the support of the signatories for Law and his policies, and noting that his resignation was not wanted.

Within two days 231 of the 280 Conservative MPs had signed it; 27 frontbenchers had not been invited, neither had five who were not in London, seven who were ill, the Speaker and a few others who could not be found – only eight MPs actively refused to sign. Law&#x27;s official response took the form of an open letter published on 13 January 1913, in which Law offered a compromise that food duties would not be placed before Parliament to vote on until after a second, approving election took place.

===Irish Home Rule===

The January and December elections in 1910 destroyed the large Liberal majority, meaning they relied on the Irish Nationalists to maintain a government. As a result, they were forced to consider Home Rule, and with the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 which replaced the Lords&#x27; veto with a two-year power of delay on most issues, the Conservative Party became aware that unless they could dissolve Parliament or sabotage the Home Rule Bill, introduced in 1912, it would most likely become law by 1914.

As the child of an Ulster family who had spent much time in the area (his father had moved back there several years after Law moved to Scotland), Law believed the gap between Ulster Unionism and Irish Nationalism could never be crossed. Despite this he said little about Home Rule until the passing of the Parliament Act in 1911, calling it the &quot;Home Rule in Disguise Act&quot; and saying it was an attempt to change parliamentary procedures so as to allow Home Rule &quot;through the back door&quot;.

After the act&#x27;s passage, he made a speech in the Commons saying if the Liberals wished to pass a Home Rule Bill they should submit it to the electorate by calling a general election. His elevation to the leadership of the Conservative Party allowed him a platform to voice his opinion to the public, and his speeches (culminating with the January 1912 speech at the Royal Albert Hall) were centred on Home Rule as much as they were around tariff reform. In contrast to Balfour&#x27;s &quot;milk and water&quot; opposition to Home Rule, Law presented a &quot;fire and blood&quot; opposition to Home Rule that at times seemed to suggest that he was willing to contemplate a civil war to stop Home Rule. Law stated he would not stop &quot;from any action ... we think necessary to defeat one of the most ignoble conspiracies ... ever formed against the liberties of free-born men.&quot; As the Conservative Party was badly divided by the tariff issue, Law had decided to make opposition for Home Rule his signature issue as the best way of unifying the Conservative Party. Right form the start, Law presented his anti-Home Rule stance more in terms of protecting Protestant majority Ulster from being ruled by a Parliament in Dublin that would be dominated by Catholics than in terms of preserving the Union, much to the chagrin of many Unionists.

Law was supported by Sir Edward Carson, leader of the Ulster Unionists. Although Law sympathised with the Ulster Unionists politically he did not agree with the religious intolerance shown to Catholics. The passions unleashed by the Home Rule debate frequently threatened to get out of hand. In January 1912, when Winston Churchill planned to deliver a speech in favour of Home Rule in at the Ulster Hall in Belfast, the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC) threatened to use violence if necessary to stop Churchill from speaking. The legal scholar A. V. Dicey, himself an opponent of Home Rule, wrote in a letter to Law that the threats of violence were &quot;the worst mistake&quot; that undermined &quot;the whole moral strength&quot; of the Unionist movement. But as Carson admitted in a letter to Law, the situation in Belfast was beyond his control as many UUC members were also members of the Orange Order, and the prospect of Churchill&#x27;s visit to Belfast had angered so many of his followers that he felt he had to threaten violence as the best possible way of stopping the planned speech instead of leaving it to his followers who might otherwise riot. As it was, Churchill agreed to cancel his speech in response to warnings that the police would not be able to guarantee his security. Besides for his concerns about the violence, Dicey was also worried about the way in which Law was more interested about stopping Home Rule from being imposed on Ulster, instead of all of Ireland, which seemed to imply he was willing to accept the partition of Ireland. Many Irish Unionists outside of Ulster felt abandoned by Law, who seemed to care only about Ulster.

====Third Home Rule Bill====

The 1912 session of Parliament opened on 14 February with a stated intent by the Liberal Party in the King&#x27;s Speech to introduce a new Home Rule Bill. The bill was to be introduced on 11 April, and four days before that Law travelled to Ulster for a tour of the area. The pinnacle of this was a meeting on 9 April in the grounds of the Royal Agricultural Society near Balmoral (an area of Belfast), attended by seventy Unionist MPs and the Primate of All Ireland, and topped by &quot;perhaps the largest Union Jack ever made&quot; – 48 feet by 25 feet on a flagpole 90 feet high.

At the meeting both Law and Carson swore to the crowd that &quot;never under any circumstances will we submit to Home Rule&quot;. However, the Parliament Act and the government majority made such a victory against the Bill unlikely unless the government could be brought down or Parliament dissolved. A second problem was that not all Unionists opposed Home Rule to the same degree; some hardcore Unionists would oppose any attempt at Home Rule, others thought it inevitable that the Bill would pass and were simply trying to get the best deal possible for Ulster. The spectre of civil war was also raised – the Ulstermen began to form paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteers, and there was a strong possibility that if it came to fighting the British Army would have to be sent in to support the underfunded and understaffed Royal Irish Constabulary.

The argument of Law and the Unionists between 1912 and 1914 was based on three complaints. Firstly, Ulster would never accept forced Home Rule, and made up a quarter of Ireland; if the Liberals wanted to force this issue, military force would be the only way. Law thundered that &quot;Do you plan to hurl the full majesty and power of the law, supported on the bayonets of the British Army, against a million Ulstermen marching under the Union Flag and singing &#x27;God Save The King&#x27;? Would the Army hold? Would the British people – would the Crown – stand for such a slaughter?&quot; A second complaint was that the government had so far refused to submit it to a general election, as Law had been suggesting since 1910. Law warned that &quot;you will not carry this Bill without submitting it to the people of this country, and, if you make the attempt, you will succeed only in breaking our Parliamentary machine&quot;. The third complaint was that the Liberals had still not honoured the preamble of the Parliament Act 1911, which promised &quot;to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of a hereditary basis&quot;. The Unionist argument was that the Liberals were trying to make a massive constitutional change while the constitution was suspended. In May 1912, Law was told by the Conservative whip Lord Balcarres that outside of Ireland &quot;the electors are apathetic&quot; about Home Rule, suggesting that he should de-emphasis the topic.

In July 1912, Asquith travelled to Dublin (the first sitting prime minister to do so in over a century) to make a speech, ridiculing Unionist demands for a referendum on the issue via an election and calling their campaign &quot;purely destructive in its objects, anarchic and chaotic in its methods&quot;. In response the Unionists had a meeting on 27 July at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, one of Asquith&#x27;s ministers. More than 13,000 people attended, including over 40 peers. In Law&#x27;s speech he said &quot;I said so to [the Liberals] and I say so now, with the full sense of the responsibility which attaches to my position, that if the attempt be made under present conditions, I can imagine no length of resistance to which Ulster will go, in which I shall not be ready to support them, and in which they will not be supported by the overwhelming majority of the British people&quot;. Law added that if Asquith continued with the Home Rule bill, the government would be &quot;lighting the fires of civil war&quot;. This speech was more known and criticised than any others; it implied both he and the British people would support the Ulstermen in anything, including armed rebellion.

Despite the conflict and fierce resistance, the Bill continued its passage through Parliament. It moved to its second reading on 9 June, and the Committee stage on 11 June, where it became fraught in controversy after a young Liberal named Thomas Agar-Robartes proposed an amendment excluding four of the Ulster counties (Londonderry, Down, Antrim, and Armagh) from the Irish Parliament. This put Law in a delicate situation, since he had previously said that he would support a system allowing each county to remain &quot;outside the Irish Parliament&quot;, at the same time saying that he would not support any amendment that did not have Ulster&#x27;s full co-operation. If he accepted the amendment, he would be seen as abandoning the Irish Unionists, but on the other hand if the amendment was carried it might disrupt the government by causing a split between the Liberals and Irish Nationalists, bringing down the government and thus forcing an election.

If Unionists wished to win the ensuing election they would have to show they were willing to compromise. In the end the amendment failed, but with the Liberal majority reduced by 40, and when a compromise amendment was proposed by another Liberal MP the government Whips were forced to trawl for votes. Law saw this as a victory, as it highlighted the split in the government. Edward Carson tabled another amendment on 1 January 1913 which would exclude all nine Ulster counties, more to test government resolve than anything else. While it failed, it allowed the Unionists to portray themselves as the party of compromise and the Liberals as stubborn and recalcitrant.

The Unionists in Ulster were committed to independence from any Irish Home Rule. They secretly authorised a Commission of Five to write a constitution for &quot;a provisional Government of Ulster ... to come into operation on the day of the passage of any Home Rule Bill, to remain in force until Ulster shall again resume unimpaired citizenship in the United Kingdom&quot;.

On 28 September 1912, Carson led 237,638 of his followers in signing a Solemn League and Covenant saying that Ulster would refuse to recognise the authority of any Parliament of Ireland arising from Home Rule. The &quot;Ulster Covenant&quot;, as the Solemn League and Covenant was popularly called, recalled the National Covenant signed by the Scots in 1638 to resist King Charles I who was viewed by Scots Presbyterians as a crypto-Catholic, and was widely seen as a sectarian document that promoted a &quot;Protestant crusade&quot;. The Conservative MP Alfred Cripps wrote in a letter to Law that English Catholics like himself were opposed to Home Rule, but he was troubled by the way that Law seemed to be using the issue as &quot;an occasion to attack their religion&quot;. In his reply of 7 October 1912, Law wrote he was opposed to religious bigotry and claimed that, as far he could tell, no &quot;responsible&quot; Unionist leader in Ireland had attacked the Roman Catholic Church. In fact, the Conservative MP Lord Hugh Cecil had in the summer of 1912 given anti-Home Rule speeches in Ireland where he shouted &quot;To Hell with the Pope!&quot;, and was not censured by Law. When Parliament resumed in October after the summer recess, the Home Rule Bill was passed by the Commons. As expected, the House of Lords rejected it 326 to 69, and under the provisions of the Parliament Act it could only be passed if it was passed twice more by the Commons in successive Parliaments. In December 1912, the chairmen of the Conservative Party, Arthur Steel-Maitland, wrote to Law that the Home Rule issue did not command much attention in England, and asked that he move away from the topic which he asserted was damaging the image of the Conservatives.

====Second passage====

The end of 1912 saw the end of a year of political struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. In response, the UUC created a paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), to fight against the British government if necessary to stop Home Rule. The Conservative politician Lord Hythe, wrote to Law to suggest the Conservatives needed to present a constructive alternative to Home Rule and he had the &quot;duty to tell these Ulstermen&quot; that there was no need for the UVF. Another Tory peer, Lord Sailsbury, wrote to Law that as much as he was opposed to Home Rule that: &quot;I cannot support political lawlessness and I shall either disenfranchise myself or vote Liberal ... rather than encourage armed resistance in Ulster.&quot; Lord Balcarres wrote to Law that much of the Conservative caucus were &quot;deeply confused and uncertain&quot; and the &quot;policies of reckless defiance&quot; were unpopular with the party membership in England. Balcarres wrote he was &quot;much alarmed lest some sporadic outbreak by Orangemen should ... alienate English sympathies&quot;. Lord Lansdowne advised Law to be &quot;extremely careful in our relations with Carson and his friends&quot; and find a way of stopping F. E. Smith&#x27;s &quot;habit of expressing rather violent sentiments in the guise of messages from the Unionist party&quot;. Balfour wrote to Law that he had &quot;much misgiving upon the general loosening of the ordinary ties of social obligation ... I do most strongly feel that nothing can be more demoralising to a society than that some of its ... most loyal members should deliberately organise themselves for the purpose of offering ... armed resistance to persons ... representing lawful authority.&quot;

During the debate on the Home Rule bill, Carson submitted an amendment that would exclude the 9 counties of Ulster from the jurisdiction of the proposed Parliament that would govern from Dublin, which was defeated by the Liberal MPs. However, Carson&#x27;s amendment which would lead to the partition of Ireland caused much alarm with Irish Unionists outside of Ulster and led many to write letters from Law seeking assurances that he would not abandon them for the sake of saving Ulster from Home Rule. Carson told Law that he favoured a compromise under which Home Rule would be granted to southern Ireland, but not Ulster, and at the same time some sort of home rule be granted to Wales and Scotland as well. Law himself in a letter to a friend stated that the British public was &quot;so sick of the whole Irish question&quot; that the majority would probably agree to a compromise of a Home Rule for Ireland sans Ulster.

Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the royal assent on it, something that horrified Law&#x27;s constitutional law adviser A. V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable – they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule be put to the electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.

Asquith responded with two notes, the first countering the Unionist claim that it would be acceptable for the King to dismiss Parliament or withhold assent of the Bill to force an election, and the second arguing that a Home Rule election would not prove anything, since a Unionist victory would only be due to other problems and scandals and would not assure supporters of the current government that Home Rule was truly opposed.

King George pressed for a compromise, summoning various political leaders to Balmoral Castle individually for talks. Law arrived on 13 September, and again pointed out to the King his belief that if the Government continued to refuse an election fought over Home Rule and instead forced it on Ulster, the Ulstermen would not accept it and any attempts to enforce it would not be obeyed by the British Army.

By early October, the King was pressuring the British political world for an all-party conference. Fending this off, Law instead met with senior party members to discuss developments. Law, Balfour, Smith and Long discussed the matter, all except Long favouring a compromise with the Liberals. Long represented the anti-Home Rule elements in Southern Ireland, and from this moment onwards Southern and Northern attitudes towards Home Rule began to diverge. Law then met with Edward Carson, and afterwards expressed the opinion that &quot;the men of Ulster do desire a settlement on the basis of leaving Ulster out, and Carson thinks such an arrangement could be carried out without any serious attack from the Unionists in the South&quot;.

On 8 October, Asquith wrote to Law suggesting an informal meeting of the two party leaders, which Law accepted. The two met at Cherkley Court, the home of Law&#x27;s ally Sir Max Aitken MP (later Lord Beaverbrook), on 14 October. The meeting lasted an hour, and Law told Asquith that he would continue to try to have Parliament dissolved, and that in any ensuing election the Unionists would accept the result even if it went against them. Law later expressed his fear to Lansdowne that Asquith would persuade the Irish Nationalists to accept Home Rule with the exclusion of four Ulster counties with Protestant/unionist majorities. Carson would not accept this, requiring six of nine ulster counties to be excluded (i.e., four with unionist majorities plus two majority nationalist, leaving the three Ulster counties with large nationalist majorities, leading to an overall unionist majority in the six); such a move might split the Unionists. Law knew that Asquith was unlikely to consent to a general election, since he would almost certainly lose it, and that any attempt to pass the Home Rule Bill &quot;without reference to the electorate&quot; would lead to civil disturbance. As such, Asquith was stuck &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot; and was sure to negotiate.

Asquith and Law met for a second private meeting on 6 November, at which Asquith raised three possibilities. The first, suggested by Sir Edward Grey, consisted of &quot;Home Rule within Home Rule&quot; – Home Rule covering Ulster, but with partial autonomy for Ulster. The second was that Ulster would be excluded from Home Rule for a number of years before becoming part of it, and the third was that Ulster would be excluded from Home Rule for as long as it liked, with the opportunity of joining when it wished. Law made it clear to Asquith that the first two options were unacceptable, but the third might be accepted in some circles.

The leaders then discussed the geographical definition of the area to be excluded from Home Rule; Ulster formally consists of nine counties, of which only four had a clear unionist majority, three a clear nationalist majority and two a small nationalist majority – however, overall a practical problem was that the nine counties of Ulster were majority nationalist. Carson always referred to nine counties of Ulster, but Law told Asquith that if an appropriate settlement could be made with a smaller number, Carson &quot;would see his people and probably, though I could not give any promise to that effect, try to induce them to accept it&quot;.

The third meeting was on 10 December and Law, raging because Asquith had not yet presented a concrete way to exclude Ulster, made little progress. Law brushed aside Asquith&#x27;s suggestions and insisted that only the exclusion of Ulster was worth considering. He later wrote that &quot;My feeling, however, is that Asquith has no hope whatsoever of making such an arrangement and that his present idea is simply to let things drift in the meantime ... I do not understand why he took the trouble of seeing me at all. The only explanation I can give is that I think he is in a funk about the whole position and thought that meeting me might keep the thing open at least&quot;.

With the failure of these talks, Law accepted that a compromise was unlikely, and from January 1914 he returned to the position that the Unionists were &quot;opposed utterly to Home Rule&quot;. The campaign was sufficient to bring the noted organiser Lord Milner back into politics to support the Unionists, and he immediately asked L. S. Amery to write a British Covenant saying that the signers would, if the Home Rule Bill passed, &quot;feel justified in taking or supporting any action that may be effective to prevent it being put into operation, and more particularly to prevent the armed forces of the Crown being used to deprive the people of Ulster of their rights as citizens of the United Kingdom&quot;. The Covenant was announced at a massive rally in Hyde Park on 4 April 1914, with hundreds of thousands assembling to hear Milner, Long and Carson speak. By the middle of the summer Long claimed more than 2,000,000 people had signed the Covenant.

Law&#x27;s critics, including George Dangerfield, condemned his actions in assuring the Ulster Unionists of Conservative Party support in their armed resistance to Home Rule, as unconstitutional, verging on promoting a civil war. Law&#x27;s supporters argued that he was acting constitutionally by forcing the Liberal government into calling the election it had been avoiding, to obtain a mandate for their reforms.

====Army (Annual) Act====

Law was not directly involved in the British Covenant campaign as he was focusing on a practical way to defeat the Home Rule Bill. His first attempt was via the Army (Annual) Act, something that &quot;violated a basic and ancient principle of the constitution&quot;. Every year since the Glorious Revolution, the Act had fixed the maximum number of soldiers in the British Army; rejecting it would technically make the British Army an illegal institution.

Lord Selborne had written to Law in 1912 to point out that vetoing or significantly amending the Act in the House of Lords would force the government to resign, and such a course of action was also suggested by others in 1913–14. Law believed that subjecting Ulstermen to a Dublin-based government they did not recognise was itself constitutionally damaging, and that amending the Army (Annual) Act to prevent the use of force in Ulster (he never suggested vetoing it) would not violate the constitution any more than the actions the government had already undertaken.

By 12 March he had established that, should the Home Rule Bill be passed under the Parliament Act 1911, the Army (Annual) Act should be amended in the Lords to stipulate that the Army could not &quot;be used in Ulster to prevent or interfere with any step which may thereafter be taken in Ulster to organise resistance to the enforcement of the Home Rule Act in Ulster nor to suppress any such resistance until and unless the present Parliament has been dissolved and a period of three months shall have lapsed after the meeting of a new Parliament&quot;. The Shadow Cabinet consulted legal experts, who agreed wholeheartedly with Law&#x27;s suggestion. Although several members expressed dissent, the Shadow Cabinet decided &quot;provisionally to agree to amendment of army act. but to leave details and decisions as to the moment of acting to Lansdowne and Law&quot;. In the end no amendment to the Army Act was offered, though; many backbenchers and party loyalists became agitated by the scheme and wrote to him that it was unacceptable – Ian Malcolm, a fanatical Ulster supporter, told Law that amending the Army Act would drive him out of the Party.

==World War I==

On 30 July 1914, on the eve of World War I, Law met with Asquith and agreed to temporarily suspend the issue of Home Rule to avoid domestic discontent during wartime. By the following day both leaders had convinced their parties to agree to this move. On 3 August, Law promised openly in Commons that his Conservative Party would give &quot;unhesitating support&quot; to the government&#x27;s war policy. On 4 August, Germany rejected British demands for a withdrawal from Belgium, and Britain declared war.

Over the coming months, the Liberal, Labour and Conservative whips worked out a truce suspending confrontational politics until either 1 January 1915 or until the end of the War. On 4 August, both Asquith and Law made speeches together at the Middlesex Guildhall, and uncomfortably socialised with each other&#x27;s parties. On 6 August, the Conservatives learnt that Asquith planned to put the Home Rule Bill on the statute books; Law wrote an angry letter to Asquith, the response of which was that Asquith could either pass the bill immediately, suspending it for the duration of the conflict, or make it law with a six-month delay and with a three-year exclusion for Ulster. Law responded with a speech in the Commons, saying that &quot;the Government have treated us abominably ... but we are in the middle of a great struggle. Until that struggle [is] over, so far as we are concerned, in everything connected with it there would be no parties, there would openly be a nation. In regard to this debate I have made protest as well as I could, but when I have finished we shall take no further part in the discussion&quot;. The entire Party then left the Commons silently, and although a strong protest (Asquith later admitted that &quot;it was unique in my or I think anybody&#x27;s experience&quot;) the bill was still passed, although with a suspension for the duration of the War.

The Conservatives soon began to get annoyed that they were unable to criticise the Government, and took this into Parliament; rather than criticising policy, they would attack individual ministers, including the Lord Chancellor (who they considered &quot;far too enamoured of German culture&quot;) and the Home Secretary, who was &quot;too tender to aliens&quot;. By Christmas 1914 they were anxious about the war; it was not, in their opinion, going well, and yet they were restricted to serving on committees and making recruitment speeches. At about the same time, Law and David Lloyd George met to discuss the possibility of a coalition government. Law was supportive of the idea in some ways, seeing it as a probability that &quot;a coalition government would come in time&quot;.

===Coalition government===

====Background and information====

The crisis which forced a coalition was twofold; first the Shell Crisis of 1915, and then the resignation of Lord Fisher, the First Sea Lord. The Shell Crisis was a shortage of artillery shells on the Western Front. It indicated a failure to fully organise British industry. Asquith tried to ward off the criticism the day before the debate, praising his government&#x27;s efforts and saying that &quot;I do not believe that any army has ever either entered upon a campaign or been maintained during a campaign with better or more adequate equipment&quot;. The Conservatives, whose sources of information included officers such as Sir John French, were not put off, and instead became furious.

Over the next few days, the Conservative backbenchers threatened to break the truce and mount an attack on the government over the munitions situation. Law forced them to back down on 12 May, but on the 14th an article appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; blaming the British failure at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on the lack of munitions. This again stirred up the backbenchers, who were only just kept in line. The Shadow Cabinet took a similar line; things could not go on as they were. The crisis was only halted with the resignation of Lord Fisher. Fisher had opposed Winston Churchill over the Gallipoli Campaign, and felt that he could not continue in government if the two would be in conflict. Law knew that this would push the Conservative back bench over the edge, and met with David Lloyd George on 17 May to discuss Fisher&#x27;s resignation. Lloyd George decided that &quot;the only way to preserve a united front was to arrange for more complete cooperation between parties in the direction of the War&quot;. Lloyd George reported the meeting to Asquith, who agreed that a coalition was inescapable. He and Law agreed to form a coalition government.

Law&#x27;s next job, therefore, was to assist the Liberal Party in creating a new government. In their discussions on 17 May, both Law and Lloyd George had agreed that Lord Kitchener should not remain in the War Office, and removing him became top priority. Unfortunately the press began a campaign supporting Kitchener on 21 May, and the popular feeling that this raised convinced Law, Lloyd George and Asquith that Kitchener could not be removed. To keep him and at the same time remove the munitions supply from his grasp to prevent a repeat of the &quot;shells crisis&quot; the Ministry of Munitions was created, with Lloyd George becoming Minister of Munitions.

Law eventually accepted the post of Colonial Secretary, an unimportant post in wartime; Asquith had made it clear that he would not allow a Conservative minister to head the Exchequer, and that with Kitchener (whom he considered a Conservative) in the War Office, he would not allow another Conservative to hold a similarly important position. Fearing for the integrity of the coalition, Law accepted this position. Outside of Law&#x27;s position, other Conservatives also gained positions in the new administration; Arthur Balfour became First Lord of the Admiralty, Austen Chamberlain became Secretary of State for India and Edward Carson became Attorney General.

====Colonial Secretary====

During Law&#x27;s time as Colonial Secretary, the three main issues were the question of manpower for the British Army, the crisis in Ireland and the Dardanelles Campaign. Dardanelles took priority, as seen by Asquith&#x27;s restructuring of his War Council into a Dardanelles Committee. Members included Kitchener, Law, Churchill, Lloyd George and Lansdowne, with the make-up divided between political parties to defuse tension and provide criticism of policy. The main discussion was on the possibility of reinforcing the forces already landed, something Law disagreed with. With Asquith and the Army in support, however, he felt that he was ill-equipped to combat the proposal. Five more divisions were landed, but faced heavy casualties for little gain. As a result, Law led a strong resistance to the idea at the next Committee meeting on 18 August. The idea only avoided being scrapped thanks to the French promise to send forces in early September, and the arguing became an immense strain on the government.

Law entered the coalition government as Colonial Secretary in May 1915, his first Cabinet post, and, following the resignation of Prime Minister and Liberal Party Leader Asquith in December 1916, was invited by King George V to form a government, but he deferred to Lloyd George, Secretary of State for War and former Minister of Munitions, who he believed was better placed to lead a coalition ministry. He served in Lloyd George&#x27;s War Cabinet, first as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons.

While chancellor, he raised the stamp duty on cheques from one penny to twopence in 1918. His promotion reflected the great mutual trust between the two leaders and made for a well co-ordinated political partnership; their coalition was re-elected by a landslide following the Armistice. Law&#x27;s two eldest sons were both killed whilst fighting in the war. In the 1918 general election, Law returned to Glasgow and was elected as member for Glasgow Central.

==Post-war and prime minister==


At war&#x27;s end, Law gave up the Exchequer for the less demanding sinecure office of Lord Privy Seal, but remained Leader of the Commons. In 1921, ill health forced his resignation as Conservative leader and Leader of the Commons in favour of Austen Chamberlain. His departure weakened the hardliners in the cabinet who were opposed to negotiating with the Irish Republican Army, and the Anglo-Irish War ended in the summer.

By 1921–22, the coalition had become embroiled in an air of moral and financial corruption (e.g. the sale of honours). Besides the recent Irish Treaty and Edwin Montagu&#x27;s moves towards greater self-government for India, both of which dismayed rank-and-file Conservative opinion, the government&#x27;s willingness to intervene against the Bolshevik regime in Russia also seemed out of step with the new and more pacifist mood. A sharp slump in 1921 and a wave of strikes in the coal and railway industries also added to the government&#x27;s unpopularity, as did the apparent failure of the Genoa Conference, which ended in an apparent rapprochement between Germany and Soviet Russia. In other words, it was no longer the case that Lloyd George was an electoral asset to the Conservative Party.

Lloyd George, Birkenhead and Winston Churchill (still distrusted by many Conservatives) wished to use armed force against Turkey (the Chanak Crisis), but had to back down when offered support only by New Zealand and Newfoundland, and not Canada, Australia or the Union of South Africa; Law wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; in support of the government, but stating that Britain could not &quot;act as the policeman for the world&quot;.

At a meeting at the Carlton Club, Conservative backbenchers, led by the President of the Board of Trade Stanley Baldwin and influenced by the recent Newport by-election, which was won from the Liberals by a Conservative, voted to end the Lloyd George Coalition and fight the next election as an independent party. Austen Chamberlain resigned as Party Leader, Lloyd George resigned as prime minister and Law took both jobs on 23 October 1922.

Many leading Conservatives (e.g. Birkenhead, Arthur Balfour, Austen Chamberlain, Robert Horne) were not members of the new Cabinet, which Birkenhead contemptuously referred to as &quot;the Second Eleven&quot;. Although the Coalition Conservatives numbered no more than thirty, they hoped to dominate any future Coalition government in the same way that the similarly sized Peelite group had dominated the Coalition Government of 1852–1855 – an analogy much used at the time.

Parliament was immediately dissolved, and a General Election ensued. Besides the two Conservative factions, the Labour Party were fighting as a major national party for the first time and indeed became the main Opposition after the election; the Liberals were still split into Asquith and Lloyd George factions, with many Lloyd George Liberals still unopposed by Conservative candidates (including Churchill, who was defeated at Dundee nonetheless). Despite the confused political arena the Conservatives were re-elected with a comfortable majority.

Questions were raised about whether the elderly Conservative Party Treasurer, Lord Farquhar, had passed on to Lloyd George (who during his premiership had amassed a large fund, largely from the sale of honours) any money intended for the Conservative Party. The Coalition Conservatives also hoped to obtain Conservative Party money from Farquhar. Bonar Law found Farquhar too &quot;gaga&quot; to properly explain what had happened, and dismissed him.

One of the questions which taxed Law&#x27;s brief government was that of inter-Allied war debts. Britain owed money to the US, and in turn was owed four times as much money by France, Italy and the other Allied powers, although under the Lloyd George government Balfour had promised that Britain would collect no more money from other Allies than she was required to repay the United States; the debt was hard to repay as trade (exports were needed to earn foreign currency) had not returned to prewar levels.

On a trip to the United States, Stanley Baldwin, the inexperienced Chancellor of the Exchequer, agreed to repay £40 million per annum to the United States rather than the £25 million which the British government had thought feasible, and on his return announced the deal to the press when his ship docked at Southampton, before the Cabinet had had a chance to consider it. Law contemplated resignation, and after being talked out of it by senior ministers vented his feelings in an anonymous letter to &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Resignation and death==

Law was soon diagnosed with terminal throat cancer and, no longer physically able to speak in Parliament, resigned on 20 May 1923. King George V sent for Baldwin, whom Law is rumoured to have favoured over Lord Curzon. However Law did not offer any advice to the King. Law died later that same year in London at the age of 65.
His funeral was held at Westminster Abbey where later his ashes were interred. He was the first British prime minister to be cremated. His estate was probated at £35,736 (approximately £ as of 2025).

Bonar Law was the shortest-serving prime minister of the 20th century. He is often referred to as &quot;the unknown prime minister&quot;, not least because of a biography of that title by Robert Blake; the name comes from a remark by Asquith at Law&#x27;s funeral, that they were burying the Unknown Prime Minister next to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

A tiny hamlet in the municipality of Stirling-Rawdon, Ontario, Canada, is named Bonarlaw after the British prime minister. It had been known as &quot;Big Springs&quot; and then &quot;Bellview&quot;. The Bonar Law Memorial High School in Bonar Law&#x27;s birthplace, Five Rivers, New Brunswick, Canada, is also named in his honour. Additionally, the Bonar Law-Bennett Building, a former University of New Brunswick campus library which now houses the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick, was named after both Law and R. B. Bennett.

<doc id="218290" wikidata="Q5038143" url="?curid=218290" title="Carceral archipelago">
<text>The concept of a carceral archipelago was first used by the French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault in his 1975 publication, &quot;Surveiller et Punir&quot;, to describe the modern penal system of the 1970s, embodied by the well-known penal institution at Mettray in France. The phrase combines the adjective &quot;carceral&quot;, which means that which is related to jail or prison, with archipelago—a group of islands. Foucault referred to the &quot;island&quot; units of the &quot;archipelago&quot; as a metaphor for the mechanisms, technologies, knowledge systems and networks related to a carceral continuum. The 1973 English publication of the book by Solzhenitsyn called &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; referred to the forced labor camps and prisons that composed the sprawling carceral network of the Soviet Gulag.

Concepts developed in Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; have been widely used by researchers in the growing, multi-disciplinary field of &quot;carceral state&quot; studies, as part of the &quot;carceral turn&quot; in the 1990s. Foucault, who died in the 1980s, did not witness the &quot;unparalleled escalation of prison populations&quot; of the carceral state in the United States. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, the incarceration rate in the US increased by a factor of five, reaching an incarceration rate of 1 in 100 by 2008. Until the carceral turn, scholars propose how what they describe as the American mass incarcerations and prison-industrial complex were almost invisible. In 1993, the international criminologist, Nils Christie, who was one of the first to warn of the perceived dangers of the alarming growth and danger of the crime control industry in the United States, compared the size and scope of the industry to Western style gulags.

==Etymology of the term==
Foucault first used the phrase &quot;carceral archipelago&quot; to describe the penal institution at Mettray, France. Foucault said that Mettray was the &quot;most famous of a whole series of institutions which, well beyond the frontiers of criminal law, constituted what one might call the carceral archipelago.&quot; Carceral comes from the Latin &quot;carcer&quot;, which means jail or prison and archipelago refers to a group of islands.

&quot;Archipelago&quot;, as used by Foucault, refers to Alexander Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book, &quot;The Gulag Archipelago: An Experiment in Literary Investigation&quot;, about the Soviet carceral system of forced labor. The book described the Russian Gulag&#x27;s vast network of dozens of camps and hundreds of labour colonies scattered across the Soviet Union. &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, written between 1958 and 1968, was first published in English in 1974 and was based on Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s own experience as a prisoner. It has been described as the book that &quot;brought down an empire&quot;, the most powerful indictment of a &quot;political regime...in modern times&quot;, and &quot;a head-on challenge to the Soviet state.&quot;

==&quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;==
Foucault was writing &quot;Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison&quot; in the early 1970s, against the backdrop of prison revolts &quot;throughout the world&quot; that protested a century-old system of cold, suffocation, overcrowding, hunger, physical maltreatment, so-called &quot;model prisons&quot;, tranquilizers, and isolation.

As a co-founder of the Groupe d&#x27;Information sur les Prisons (GIP)—a group that was active in France for several years in the early 1970s—Foucault was highly critical of the French penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents. A year after the GIP folded, Foucault published &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, in which he examined the evolution of the penal system, away from corporal and capital punishment, into the modern carceral system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century. His biographer Didier Eribon described &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; as &quot;perhaps the finest&quot; of Foucault&#x27;s works.

Foucault described &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; as providing a &quot;historical background&quot; to the &quot;formation of knowledge in modern society&quot;. It provides a &quot;history of the modern soul.&quot; He provided a &quot;genealogy of the present scientifico-legal complex from which the power to punish derives its bases, justifications and rules.&quot; In both &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; (1975) and &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; (1976), Foucault developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society. The carceral network, with its mechanisms of normalizing social control, made the human sciences &quot;historically possible&quot; through its analytical investment into &quot;knowable man&quot;—his &quot;soul, individuality, consciousness, and conduct. Foucault refers to the term &quot;discipline&quot; as used within punitive penal systems. In his 1969 publication, &quot;The Archaeology of Knowledge&quot;, and again in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, he investigates the origins of the &quot;disciplines&quot; in the humanities and social sciences. In the chapter on &quot;Science and Knowledge&quot;, he suggested that &#x27;disciplines&#x27; could be called &quot;groups of statements that borrow their organization from scientific models&quot; that once they were accepted, became &quot;institutionalized, transmitted, and sometimes taught as sciences.&quot; He goes on to challenge these disciplines—which he also does in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;—asking &quot;[C]ould one not say that archaeology describes disciplines that are not really sciences, while epistemology describes sciences that have been formed on the basis of (or in spite of) existing disciplines?&quot;

In his final chapter entitled simply &quot;Carceral&quot;, Foucault described how, within the penal system, disciplinary networks expanded to include carceral mechanisms and technologies, the carceral city, culture, society, system, and network—that are all part of the carceral archipelago. &quot;Medicine, psychology, education, public assistance&quot;, and social work began to assume &quot;judicial functions&quot; with an &quot;ever greater share of the powers of supervision and assessment&quot;. Foucault called these disciplines, &quot;mechanisms of normalization&quot; and described them as &quot;becoming ever more rigorous in their application&quot;. He said that the knowledge generated by the disciplines of &quot;psychology, psychiatry, pedagogy, criminology, and so many other strange sciences&quot; have a &quot;terrible power of investigation&quot; that developed the technologies and procedures of panopticism.

Foucault described how new forms of punishment in the 19th century became transformed into general techniques and procedures for controlling populations and how twentieth century society normalized social control, through constant and permanent surveillance and monitoring.

American historian, Peter Linebaugh, author of &quot;The London Hanged: Crime and Civil Society in the Eighteenth Century&quot; wrote that Foucault&#x27;s &quot;great confinement&quot;—was a contemporary form of &quot;&#x27;enclosure&#x27;, an important interpretative idea for understanding neoliberalism.&quot; &quot;Enclosure indicates private property and capital: it seems to promise both individual ownership and social productivity, but in fact the concept of enclosure is inseparable from terror and the destruction of independence and community&quot;. In &quot;The London Hanged&quot;, Linebaugh described how the population in London had become criminalized in the 18th century—&quot;People were so impoverished, they had to steal to survive.&quot; As the meaning of property changed, property laws were rewritten.

==From a culture of spectacle to a carceral society==
In &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, Foucault traced the genealogy of contemporary forms of the penal or carceral system, from the eighteenth century until the mid-1970s in the Western world.

The &quot;culture of spectacle&quot; included public displays of torture, dismemberment, and obliteration of the human body as punishment. Foucault opened &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; with a detailed description of the execution of the French citizen, Robert-François Damiens in 1757 as punishment for regicide in a public display of drawing and quartering.

According to Foucault, punishment and the criminal become an integral part of &#x27;western&#x27; scientific rationality by the late 18th century. Reformers called for &quot;better punishments. It was based it on a model &#x27;cure&#x27; for reforms—to &quot;punish with an attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply into the social body.&quot; This involved the submission of bodies through the control of ideas and the analysis of representations as a principle in a politics of bodies. Foucault quoted Servan—a member of the influential group called the &quot;Idéologues&quot;—Parisian intellectuals in the 1790s who developed ideology as a &quot;science of ideas&quot;. Servan described how a &quot;true politician&quot; guides citizens by forming a &quot;chain of ideas&quot; on [crime and punishment] that is &quot;strongly linked&quot; with the &quot;stable point of reason&quot; securing the &quot;end of the chain.&quot;

By 1810, in France, detention in the large &quot;enclosed, complex and hierarchized structure&quot;, had replaced the scaffold as the &quot;essential form of punishment&quot; and punishment was &quot;integrated into the very body of the state apparatus.&quot; The modern carceral system, was taking form with the publication by 1838, of books on prison reform by Charles Lucas, Louis-Mathurin Moreau-Christophe, and Léon Faucher. In his book &quot;House of Young Prisoners&quot;, Faucher prescribed &quot;strict discipline, exact rules, surveillance and rehabilitation&quot;. From the late 18th century through the early decades of the 19th century, modern criminal codes were implemented in Europe and North America. By 1838, with the publication of Leon Faucher&#x27;s book on prison reform, society had transitioned—the public execution was replaced by the &quot;timetable&quot;.

The carceral society—in which &quot;punishment and discipline&quot; was &quot;internalized and directed to the constitution and, when necessary, rehabilitation of social subjects&quot;—had replaced the culture of spectacle.

According to Foucault, modern penal theories—including their inherent power structures—originate with the Mettray, a French penal colony for children and youth, that operated from January 22, 1840, until 1937. To Foucault, the carceral system is personified in the French penal institutions like Mettray and Neufchatel. Foucault described Mettray as the &quot;most famous of a whole series of institutions which, well beyond the frontiers of criminal law, constituted what one might call the carceral archipelago.&quot; These penal systems included the prison, the school, the Church, and the work-house. Foucault said, &quot;Were I to fix the date of completion of the carceral system... [t]he date I would choose would be 22 January 1840, the date of the official opening of Mettray. Or better still, perhaps, that glorious day, unremarked and unrecorded, when a child in Mettray remarked as he lay dying: &#x27;What a pity I left the colony so soon.&#x27;&quot;

The body of knowledge based on prisoners in institutions, such as Mettray and Neufchatel, was the origin of the concept of the &quot;delinquent&quot; class. In his discussion on illegalities and delinquency, Foucault illustrated how &quot;programmes for correcting delinquents&quot; and &quot;mechanisms that reinforce delinquency&quot; were are all part of the carceral system that &quot;combines discourses, architectures, regulations and scientific propositions, and social effects.&quot; Foucault described three characters caught in this system, Eugène François Vidocq, Pierre François Lacenaire (1803 – 1836), and a 13-year-old charged with vagabondage who was sentenced to two years in a reformatory. Vidocq&#x27;s contemporary, Lecenaire, was the typical &quot;delinquent&quot; according to what the dominant class considered to constitute delinquency, in the first third of the nineteenth century.

===Panopticon to panopticism in a carceral culture===

By &quot;carceral culture, Foucault refers to a culture in which the panoptic model of surveillance has been diffused as a principle of social organization.&quot;

Foucault used Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s prison reforms, which included architectural plans for the Panopticon as a &quot;representative model for what happens to society in the nineteenth century.&quot; Although few of Bentham&#x27;s Panopticon&#x27;s were actually built, his plans included a central tower with individual cells that prevent interaction with each other while being constantly under the gaze of the panoptic tower, which can &quot;pan&quot; and see everything. Foucault quoted a 19th-century legal scholar who argued that Bentham&#x27;s design was an event &#x27;in the history of the human mind&#x27;. It was the &quot;birth certificate&quot; of &quot;disciplinary society&quot;. Foucault said that the idea of the Panopticon became used in many different settings in diverse ways, including the university classroom, prison schools, some classroom auditoriums, hospital and factory architecture and in &quot;urban planning—organized on a grid structure to facilitate movement but also to discourage concealment.&quot;

The Panopticon is &quot;an architectural plan&quot;, while panopticism is a &quot;set of general ideas about the control of populations&quot;.

In the chapter entitled, Panopticism, Foucault argued that the procedures and technology for the control of the plague established around 1700 became a template for a more general form of social control. In order to control the plague, a village was sequestered and every street was put under constant surveillance. The plague, he says, &quot;stands for all forms of confusion and disorder&quot;.

Foucault explains how the &quot;panoptic schema, without disappearing as such or losing any of its properties, was destined to spread throughout the social body&quot; and to &quot;become a generalized function.&quot; &quot;We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which we bring to ourselves since we are part of its mechanism.&quot;

===Beyond panoptic forms of control===
In his work after &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, Foucault became interested in a related question. Instead of looking at panoptic forms of control, he became interested in how people use information to think about themselves. He sometimes referred to this as a study of &#x27;ethics&#x27;, other times he used the grander title: &#x27;technologies of the self&#x27;. Foucault studied two related issues: what information was on hand and what people chose to do with the information. In many ways, this took him in a new direction, suggesting perhaps ways of living in the carceral archipelago without striving to escape from it.

Foucault elaborated the notion of Biopower and Biopolitics to describe the practice of modern nation states and their regulation of their subjects through &quot;an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the control of populations&quot;. Biopower refers to a &quot;set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power.&quot; &quot;Starting from the 18th century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are a species.&quot; Foucault called this phenomenon biopower. In contemporary US political science studies, poststructuralists use &quot;biopower&quot; to denote social and political power over life.

==The carceral state==
In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s prisoner coalitions — including the Chicano Movement and Black Power organizations — in American prisons protested together under the banner of &quot;slaves of the state&quot;. Their legal challenge to prison conditions was successful. In response, the state introduced a &quot;new prison regime&quot; with paramilitary equipment and practices, the increased use of privatized prisons, &quot;massive prison building programs&quot;, and new levels of punishment, such as &quot;23-hour cell isolation&quot;. Author Robert Chase called this the &quot;&#x27;Sunbelt&#x27; militarized carceral state approach that became exemplary of national prison trends.&quot;

Nils Christie, a criminology professor at the University of Oslo in Norway, in his 1993 book &quot;Crime control as industry: towards gulags, Western style?&quot; - a modern classic of criminology - argued that crime control was more dangerous to societal future than crime itself. In his 1994 review of &quot;Crime control as industry&quot;, Andrew Rutherford described Christie as a criminologist of &quot;international renown&quot;, who has written prolifically about punishment and the role of law for decades. Rutherford said that Christie &quot;exemplified the enlightened humanist tradition&quot; and called for criminal law with a &quot;minimalist intervention&quot;. Rutherford said that Christie&#x27;s writing had become much &quot;darker&quot; by 1993, as he warned of the &quot;rapaciously devouring crime control industry&quot; particularly in the United States. In a reference to Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Great Confinement&quot; in &quot; Discipline and Punish&quot;, Christie says that these &quot;new great confinements&quot; are part of an &quot;unparalleled escalation of prison populations&quot; with &quot;combat-style probation officers&quot;, and &quot;widespread privatization&quot; of prisons.

In her widely cited 2006 book, &quot;The Prison and the Gallows: The Politics of Mass Incarceration in America&quot;, Marie Gottschalk, an American political scientist and professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, traced the origins and construction of the carceral state in the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s. In &quot;The Prison and the Gallows&quot; she made reference to Foucault&#x27;s &quot;carceral archipelago&quot;. She described how &quot;a tenacious carceral state has sprouted in the shadows of mass imprisonment and has been extending its reach far beyond the prison gate. It includes not only the country’s vast archipelago of jails and prisons, but also the far-reaching and growing penal punishments and controls that lies in the never-never land between the prison gate and full citizenship. As it sunders families and communities and radically reworks conceptions of democracy, rights, and citizenship, the carceral state poses a formidable political and social challenge.&quot; She said that until the carceral turn in the social sciences in the late 1990s, &quot;mass imprisonment was largely an invisible issue in the United States&quot;. By 2014, there was widespread criticism of mass incarceration but very modest reform.

According to Ruth Wilson Gilmore, a geographer, whose 2007 book entitled, &quot;Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California&quot;, in 2007, California had the largest prison-population in the United States. Gilmore, who co-founded Critical Resistance (an U.S.-based prison-abolition group), links carceral policies to economic and social factors. She described the nine-hundred miles of prisons along &quot;prison alley&quot; with &quot;old and new prisons&quot; clustered along California Highway 99, on land that was once farmlands. She called it an &quot;archipelago of concrete and steel cages&quot; with 33 &quot;major&quot; and 57 minor prisons. Forty-three of these prisons were constructed after 1984. Brett Story, who wrote and directed the 2017 feature documentary &quot;The Prison in Twelve Landscapes&quot;, also wrote the book &quot;Prison Land: Mapping Carceral Power across Neoliberal America&quot;.
In &quot;Prison Land&quot;, Story says that carceral space &quot;stretches into the ordinary—where people gather in &quot;courtrooms and in mess halls, in visiting centers, at public defenders&#x27; offices, and on visitors&#x27; buses that take care givers to and from &quot;prison visiting centers that dot the carceral landscape.&quot;

Both Gilmore and Gottschalk are &quot;established in their fields&quot;; their ideas and assumptions reflect their home disciplines and not necessarily those of criminology, for example. The interdisciplinary field of carceral-state scholarship began to emerge in the 1970s in the United States as a critique of the penal system. Carceral-state scholarship, an area of study whose &quot;boundaries are notoriously difficult to map&quot;, includes &quot;cognate disciplines&quot; such as history and sociology, as well as critical theory, journalism and literature.

Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; has been a critical work for those whose work on geographies of power examines how the state uses detention and confinement to exclude populations. Geographer Anne Bonds investigated how social and criminal justice policies had become &quot;increasingly punitive&quot; as class and race inequalities became more entrenched. She argued that discourse on the poor obscures how poverty is produced or increased because of the &quot;neoliberal restructuring of rural economies and governance&quot;.

By 2017, the concept of a penal or carceral state - with varying definitions and parameters - had become widely used in &quot;punishment and criminal justice literature&quot;.

According to a 2017 article in &quot;Theoretical criminology&quot;, the carceral state is far from being a &quot;single, unified, and actor-less state responsible for punishment&quot;. As a result, the phrase, the carceral state, has a &quot;proliferation of meanings and is frequently undefined.&quot;

According to Dan Berger, author of &quot;The Struggle Within: Prisons, Political Prisoners, and Mass Movements in the United States&quot; (2014), the phrases &quot;carceral state&quot;, &quot;mass incarceration&quot;, and &quot;prison-industrial complex&quot; are sometimes interchanged and are frequently used by scholars in the field without providing clear definitions of their meaning. They describe the &quot;brutal history of extreme state punishment&quot; in the United States that has led to an exponential increase in the number of incarcerated individuals in the United States since the mid-1970s. With a U.S. incarceration rate of 1 in 100, the United States has imprisoned more of its citizens than any other Western democracy. Its prison population represents 25 percent of global incarceration. According to Berger, while there is much disagreement about the definition of the term &quot;carceral state&quot;, analyses of the topic all agree &quot;that the United States has a lot of people in prison, that a disproportionate number of them are people of color, that police exert too much power with too much weaponry, and that the country&#x27;s prison system is held together by an overriding investment in harsh and degrading punishment.&quot;

For geographers Stefano Bloch and Enrique Olivares-Pelayo and sociologists Loïc Wacquant, Robert Weide, and Patrick Lopez-Aguado, the Carceral State maintains racial segregation as part of enforcing prison control.

<text>The Curtiss-Wright Corporation is an American manufacturer and services provider headquartered in Davidson, North Carolina, with factories and operations in and outside the United States. Created in 1929 from the consolidation of Curtiss, Wright, and various supplier companies, the company was immediately the country&#x27;s largest aviation firm and built more than 142,000 aircraft engines for the U.S. military during World War II.

It no longer makes aircraft but still makes many related components, particularly actuators, aircraft controls, valves, and it provides surface-treatment services. It supplies equipment to the commercial, industrial, defense, and energy markets. It makes parts for commercial and naval nuclear power systems, industrial vehicles, and oil- and gas-related machinery.

==History==

===Merger and expansion===
Curtiss-Wright formed on July 5, 1929, the result of a merger of 12 companies associated with Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company of Buffalo, New York, and Wright Aeronautical of Dayton, Ohio. It was headquartered in Buffalo, New York. With $75 million in capital (equivalent to $ billion in ), it became the largest aviation company in the United States.

By September 1929, Curtiss-Wright had acquired the Moth Aircraft Corporation (which primarily built de Havilland Moth aircraft under licence) and the Travel Air Manufacturing Company.

====Divisions====
There were three main divisions: the Curtiss-Wright Airplane Division, which manufactured airframes; the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, which produced aircraft engines; and the Curtiss-Wright Propeller Division, which manufactured propellers. After 1929, most engines produced by the new company were known as Wrights. Existing aircraft continued using the Curtiss name, while new designs used either the Curtiss or Curtiss-Wright name, depending on which location they were designed by, with a few exceptions.

====Pre-World War II====
Throughout the 1930s, Curtiss-Wright designed and built aircraft for military, commercial, and private markets but it was the Wright engine division and the longstanding relationship with the U.S. military that helped the company through the difficult years of the Great Depression. Guy Vaughan was appointed president in 1935. In 1937, the company developed the P-36 fighter aircraft, resulting in the largest peacetime aircraft order ever given by the Army Air Corps. Curtiss-Wright also sold the P-36 abroad, where they were used in the early days of World War II.

====War production====
During World War II, Curtiss-Wright produced 142,840 aircraft engines, 146,468 electric propellers, and 29,269 airplanes. Curtiss-Wright employed 180,000 workers, and ranked second among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts, behind only General Motors.

Aircraft production included almost 14,000 P-40 fighters, made famous by their use by Claire Chennault&#x27;s Flying Tigers in China, over 3,000 C-46 Commando transport aircraft, and later in the war, over 7,000 SB2C Helldivers. Its most visible success came with the P-40, variously known as the Tomahawk, Kittyhawk, and Warhawk, which were built between 1940 and 1944 at the main production facilities in Buffalo, New York. During the war, a second large plant was added at Buffalo, followed by new plants at Columbus, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; and Louisville, Kentucky. Engine and propeller production was at plants in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned Curtiss-Wright a defense production factory for wartime aircraft construction at Louisville, Kentucky, to produce C-76 Caravan cargo aircraft, which was constructed mostly of wood, a non-priority war material. After difficulties with the C-76, including a crash of a production model in mid-1943, as well as the realization that sufficient quantities of aluminum aircraft alloys would be available for war production, plans for large-scale C-76 production were rejected.

The Louisville plant was converted to C-46 Commando production, delivering 438 Commandos to supplement the roughly 2,500 C-46s produced at Buffalo. The C-46 cargo aircraft was fitted with two powerful radial engines and could fly at higher altitudes than most other Allied aircraft. Consequently, it was used extensively in the China-Burma-India Theater.

====Defective engines sold to U.S. military in World War II====
From 1941 to 1943, the Curtiss Aeronautical plant in Lockland, Ohio, produced aircraft engines under wartime contract, destined for installation in U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft. Wright officials at Lockland insisted on high engine production levels, resulting in a significant percentage of engines that did not meet Army Air Forces (AAF) inspection standards. These defective engines were nevertheless approved by inspectors for shipment and installation in U.S. military aircraft. After investigation, it was later revealed that Wright company officials at Lockland had conspired with civilian technical advisers and Army inspection officers to approve substandard or defective aircraft engines for military use.

===Post–World War II===
====Demise of aircraft production====
Curtiss-Wright failed to make the transition to design and production of jet aircraft, despite several attempts. During the war, the company expended only small amounts on aircraft research and development, instead concentrating on incremental improvements in conventional aircraft already in wartime production. This was especially true in the first two years of the war. Curtiss&#x27; failure to research and develop more advanced wing and airframe designs provided an opening for North American, Bell, Lockheed, Northrop, and other U.S. aircraft manufacturers to win contracts from the Army and Navy for more advanced aircraft designs.

The P-60, the firm&#x27;s last prop-driven fighter design, was merely an extrapolation of its 1930s P-36 Hawk, offering no advantage over other designs already in service. With the rapid development of jet engine technology and near-supersonic flight, this technological lag resulted in Curtiss losing a number of critical postwar military aircraft orders. The final nail in the coffin was the choice of the Northrop F-89 Scorpion over the XF-87 Blackhawk. After the F-87 was cancelled in October 1948, Curtiss-Wright shut down its entire Aeroplane Division and sold the assets to North American Aviation. Curtiss-Wright continued to occasionally venture back into the realm of designing aircraft, such as the TDU-12/B Skydart target drone and the X-19 tilt-rotor, but none of these amounted to anything and by the early 1960s Curtiss-Wright was no longer an aircraft manufacturer.

====Flight research====
While this marked Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s departure from preeminence in the aviation industry, one notable spin-off involved Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s flight research laboratory, founded in 1943 near the main plant at the Buffalo airport. During divestiture of the airframe division, the lab was given to Cornell University along with a cash gift to finish the construction of a transonic wind tunnel. Cornell Aeronautical Labs, or CAL as it was known, was eventually spun off from the university as a private company, Calspan Corporation, which has been responsible for numerous innovations in flight and safety research.

====Engine development====
After the government gave the development of the Whittle jet engine to GE, the company concentrated on reciprocating engines and propeller production for military transport and civilian airliners. With the twilight of the big piston aircraft engine, Curtiss-Wright needed a new design direction, and in 1950, Curtiss-Wright licensed the Sapphire jet engine from Armstrong Siddeley in the U.K and manufactured it as the Wright J65. It powered models of the Martin B-57, and several U.S. fighter aircraft. Subsequent derivative engines were late and did not find substantial markets.

Curtiss-Wright briefly licensed rights to the Wankel rotary engine from NSU in 1958 as a possible aircraft power plant. For this project, Curtiss-Wright relied on the design leadership of NSU-Wankel engineer Max Bentele.

====Flight simulators====
In 1954, United Airlines bought four Curtiss-Wright flight simulators at a cost of $3 million. These simulators were unlike earlier ones produced in the late 1940s for airliners but now included visuals, sound, and movement. They were the first of today&#x27;s modern flight simulators for commercial aircraft.
====Business diversification and acquisition strategy====
In 1956, financially strapped automaker Studebaker-Packard Corporation entered into a management agreement with Curtiss-Wright to allow the nation&#x27;s fifth-largest automobile manufacturer to avoid insolvency. The relationship lasted until 1959 at which time Curtiss-Wright withdrew from the agreement. The shift of civilian aircraft to jets left the company with little of its old business, and during the 1960s it shifted to components for aircraft and other types of equipment, such as nuclear submarines, a business that continues today.

In 2002, Curtiss-Wright acquired Penny &amp; Giles, a supplier of black boxes and sensing devices (Hybrid linear, hybrid rotary and VRVT sensors).

In 2003, Curtiss-Wright acquired Systran Corporation, a supplier of specialized data communications products for real-time systems, primarily for the aerospace and defense, industrial automation and medical image markets. The acquisition also reintroduced Curtiss-Wright to Dayton, Ohio.

In 2010, Curtiss-Wright acquired Hybricon Corporation for $19 million in cash. Hybricon is a supplier of electronic packaging for the aerospace, defense, and commercial markets, and provides electronic subsystem integration.

In 2011, Curtiss-Wright acquired Ireland-based Acra Control for $61 million in cash. Acra Control is a supplier of data acquisition systems and networks, data recorders, and telemetry ground stations for both defense and commercial aerospace markets.

At the beginning of 2013, Curtiss-Wright acquired Exlar Corporation for $85 million in cash. Exlar, a private company, is a designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electric actuators used in motion control solutions in industrial and military markets. The acquired business will operate within Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s Motion Control segment. In October 2013, Curtiss-Wright completed the acquisition of the Parvus Corporation, a business unit of Eurotech S.p.A., for $38 million. Parvus is a leading designer and manufacturer of rugged small form factor computers and communications subsystems for the aerospace, defense, homeland security, and industrial markets.

Curtiss-Wright acquired military communications equipment supplier Pacific Star Communications for $400 million, on November 2, 2020.

Curtiss-Wright Corporation finalized the acquisition of 901D Holdings, LLC (901D) for $132 million in cash. Designing and manufacturing electronic systems, subsystems, and shipboard enclosures, 901D is a contributor to major U.S. Navy shipbuilding programs including both nuclear and non-nuclear powered vessels.

In February 2020, Curtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE: CW) completed the acquisition of Dyna-Flo Control Valve Services Ltd. (&quot;Dyna-Flo&quot;) for $81 million in cash.

In January 2022, Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW) announced an agreement to acquire assets from Safran Aerosystems Arresting Company (SAA), a move aimed at expanding its presence in the military aircraft emergency arresting systems sector. SAA, a subsidiary of Safran Aerosystems, specializes in designing and manufacturing aircraft emergency arresting systems and will operate within Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s Naval &amp; Power segment post-acquisition. The completion of the acquisition, valued at $240 million, is contingent on regulatory approval and other closing conditions, with expectations for finalization in the third quarter of 2022. The strategic acquisition of SAA is part of Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s efforts to enhance growth prospects and diversify its product portfolio. With an anticipated positive impact on CW&#x27;s earnings, the $240 million transaction is projected to contribute to a robust free cash flow conversion rate exceeding 100%, signaling a favorable liquidity position for the company in the future.

In November 2022, CW has finalized the acquisition of Keronite Group Limited, involving a cash transaction of $35 million. This strategic move is expected to enhance Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s capabilities in Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (&quot;PEO&quot;) surface treatment services. Operating within Curtiss-Wright&#x27;s Aerospace &amp; Industrial segment, the acquisition is projected to have a neutral impact on the company&#x27;s earnings in the initial year. It is anticipated to yield a 100% free cash flow conversion rate, underscoring the robust liquidity position. This strengthened financial position can be leveraged for profitable and revenue-generating strategies.

<text>The Federal Council is the federal cabinet of the Swiss Confederation. Its seven members also serve as the collective head of state and government of Switzerland. Since after World War II, the Federal Council is by convention a permanent grand coalition government composed of representatives of the country&#x27;s major parties and language regions.

While the entire Federal Council is responsible for leading the federal administration of Switzerland, each Councillor heads one of the seven federal executive departments. The President of the Swiss Confederation chairs the council, but exercises no particular authority; rather, the position is one of a first among equals and rotates among the seven Councillors annually.

The Federal Council is elected as a body by the 246 members of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland for a term of four years after each federal parliamentary election, without the possibility of recall or a vote of no confidence. Incumbents are not term-limited and are by convention almost always re-elected; most serve around 8 to 12 years in office.

 the members of the Federal Council are, in order of seniority:
== Origins and history ==
=== Origins of the institution ===
The Federal Council was instituted by the 1848 Federal Constitution as the &quot;supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation&quot;.

When the Constitution was written, constitutional democracy was still in its infancy, and the founding fathers of Switzerland had little in the way of examples. While they drew heavily on the United States Constitution for the organisation of the federal state as a whole, they opted for the collegial rather than the presidential system for the executive branch of government (directorial system). This accommodated the long tradition of the rule of collective bodies in Switzerland. Under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy had been governed by councils of pre-eminent citizens since time immemorial, and the later Helvetic Republic (with its equivalent Directorate) as well as the cantons that had given themselves liberal constitutions since the 1830s had also had good experiences with that mode of governance.

Today, only three other states, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andorra and San Marino, have collective rather than unitary heads of state. However the collegial system of government has found widespread adoption in modern democracies in the form of cabinet government with collective responsibility.

=== Changes in composition ===

The 1848 constitutional provision providing for the Federal Counciland indeed the institution of the Council itselfhas remained unchanged to this day, even though Swiss society has changed profoundly since.

==== Party representation ====
===== Free Democratic hegemony, 1848–1891 =====

The 1848 Constitution was one of the few successes of the Europe-wide democratic revolutions of 1848. In Switzerland, the democratic movement was ledand the new federal state decisively shapedby the &quot;Radicals&quot; (presently FDP. The Liberals). After winning the &quot;Sonderbund War&quot; (the Swiss civil war) against the Catholic cantons, the Radicals at first used their majority in the Federal Assembly to fill all the seats on the Federal Council. This made their former war opponents, the &quot;Catholic-Conservatives&quot; (presently the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party, CVP), the opposition party. Only after Emil Welti&#x27;s resignation in 1891 after a failed referendum on railway nationalisation did the Radicals decide to co-opt the Conservatives by supporting the election of Josef Zemp.

===== Emerging coalition government, 1891–1959 =====
The process of involving all major political movements of Switzerland into the responsibility of government continued during the first half of the 20th century. It was hastened by the FDP&#x27;s and CVP&#x27;s gradually diminishing voter shares, complemented by the rise of new parties of lesser power at the ends of the political spectrum. These were the Social Democratic Party (SP) on the Left and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB; presently the People&#x27;s Party, SVP) on the Right. In due course, the CVP received its second seat in 1919 with Jean-Marie Musy, while the BGB joined the council in 1929 with Rudolf Minger. In 1943, during World War II, the Social Democrats were also temporarily included with Ernst Nobs.

=====Grand coalition, 1959–2003=====

The 1959 elections, following the resignation of four councillors, finally established the &quot;Zauberformel&quot;, the &quot;magical formula&quot; that determined the council&#x27;s composition during the rest of the 20th century and established the long-standing nature of the council as a permanent, voluntary grand coalition. In approximate relation to the parties&#x27; respective strength in the Federal Assembly, the seats were distributed as follows:
* Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD): 2 members,
* Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (CVP/PDC): 2 members,
* Social Democratic Party (SP/PS): 2 members,
* Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP/UDC): 1 member.

During that time, the FDP/PRD and CVP/PDC very slowly but steadily kept losing voter share to the SVP/UDC and SP/PS, respectively, which overtook the older parties in popularity during the 1990s.

=====End of the grand coalition, 2008=====
The governmental balance was changed after the 2003 elections, when the SVP/UDC was granted a council seat for their leader Christoph Blocher that had formerly belonged to the CVP/PDC&#x27;s Ruth Metzler. Due to controversies surrounding his conduct in office, a narrow Assembly majority did not reelect Blocher in 2007 and chose instead Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, a more moderate SVP/UDC politician, against party policy. This led to a split of the SVP/UDC in 2008. After liberal regional SVP/UDC groups including Federal Councillors Widmer-Schlumpf and Samuel Schmid founded a new Conservative Democratic Party, the SVP/UDC was left in opposition for the first time since 1929, but returned into the council with the election of Ueli Maurer on 10 December 2008, who regained the seat previously held by Schmid, who had resigned. The SVP/UDC regained its second seat on the Council in 2015, when Widmer-Schlumpf decided to resign after the SVP/UDC&#x27;s large election gains in the 2015 election, being replaced by Guy Parmelin.

==== Women on the council ====
Women gained suffrage on the federal level in 1971. They remained unrepresented in the Federal Council for three further legislatures, until the 1984 election of Elisabeth Kopp. In 1983, the failed election of the first official female candidate, Lilian Uchtenhagen and again in 1993 the failed election of Christiane Brunner (both SP/PS), was controversial and the Social Democrats each time considered withdrawing from the council altogether.

There were two female councillors serving simultaneously for the first time in 1999, and three out of seven councillors were women from 2007 till 2010, when Simonetta Sommaruga was elected as the fourth woman in government in place of Moritz Leuenberger, putting men in minority for the first time in history. Also remarkable is the fact that the eighth non-voting member of government, the chancellor, who sets the government agenda, was also a woman.

In total, there have been ten female councillors in the period 1989 to present:

*The first woman councillor was Elisabeth Kopp (FDP/PRD), elected 1984, resigned in 1989.
*Ruth Dreifuss (SP/PS), served from 1993 to 2002, was the first woman to become President of the Confederation in 1999. Since her election there has always been at least one woman on the council.
*Ruth Metzler (Metzler-Arnold at the time) (CVP/PDC), served from 1999 to 2003 and was not re-elected to a second term (see above). Upon her election two women served on the council simultaneously for the first time.
*Micheline Calmy-Rey (SP/PS) was elected in 2003 and served until 2011.
*Doris Leuthard (CVP/PDC) was elected in 2006 and served until 2018.
*Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf was elected in December 2007 and served until December 2015.
*Simonetta Sommaruga was elected in September 2010. Together with Micheline Calmy-Rey, Doris Leuthard and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, women were in the majority in the Federal Council for the first time, until January 2012, when Alain Berset replaced Micheline Calmy-Rey.
* Karin Keller-Sutter and Viola Amherd were elected on 5 December 2018 and are currently on the council.
* Élisabeth Baume-Schneider was elected on 7 December 2022 and is the most recent woman to be elected to the council.

==== Regional balancing acts ====
Until 1999, the Constitution mandated that no canton could have multiple representatives on the Federal Council at the same time. For most of Swiss history, the canton of any given councillor was determined by their place of origin, but starting in 1987 this was changed to the canton from which they were elected (for former members of the Federal Assembly or cantonal legislative or executive bodies) or place of residence. Nothing prevented candidates from moving to politically expedient cantons; this was one of the motivators for abolishing the rule. At the 1999 Swiss referendums, the Constitution was changed to require an equitable distribution of seats among the cantons and language groups of the country, without setting concrete quotas.

Since the rule against Federal Councillors being from the same canton was abolished, there have been a few examples of it happening. The first time was from 2003 to 2007, when both Moritz Leuenberger and Christoph Blocher from the canton of Zurich were in office. It happened again between 2010 and 2018, starting when Simonetta Sommaruga and Johann Schneider-Ammann from the canton of Bern were elected in 2010. As of 2023, four cantons have never been represented on the Federal Council: Nidwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Uri. The canton of Jura is the most recent canton to be represented; since 1 January 2023, it has been represented by Elisabeth Baume-Schneider.

With the council&#x27;s 2023 iteration, the constitutional requirement that languages and regions be appropriately balanced is under increased strain. &quot;Latin speakers&quot; – people who either speak French, Italian, or Romansh – now form a majority on the council, despite more than sixty percent of the Swiss citizens speaking German as a first language. Likewise, no current Federal Councillors grew up in an urban area (with the exception of Karin Keller-Sutter, who spent some school years in Neuchâtel NE).

Whenever a member resigns, they are generally replaced by someone who is not only from the same party, but also the same language group. In 2006, however, Joseph Deiss, a French-speaker, resigned and was succeeded by Doris Leuthard, a German-speaker. In 2016, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, a German-speaker, was succeeded by Guy Parmelin, a French-speaker. Most recently, in 2023, German-speaking Simmonetta Sommaruga was replaced by French-speaking Elisabeth Baume-Schneider. Historically, at least two council seats have been held by French- or Italian-speakers. The language makeup of the council as of 2022 is four German-speakers, two French-speakers and one Italian-speaker. In November 2017, Ignazio Cassis became the first Italian speaker to serve on the council since 1999. For elections to the Federal Council, candidates are usually helped by a high degree of fluency in German, French, and Italian.

== Operation ==
=== Presidency ===
Each year, one of the seven councillors is elected by the United Federal Assembly as President of the Confederation. The Federal Assembly also elects a vice president of Switzerland. By convention, the positions of president and vice president rotate annually, each councillor thus becoming vice president and then president every seven years while in office.

According to the Swiss order of precedence, the president of the Confederation is the highest-ranking Swiss official. They preside over council meetings and carry out certain representative functions that, in other countries, are the business of a head of state. In urgent situations where a council decision cannot be made in time, they are empowered to act on behalf of the whole council. Apart from that, though, they are , having no power above and beyond the other six Councillors.

The president is not the Swiss head of state; this function is carried out by the council &quot;in corpore&quot;, that is, in its entirety. However, in recent practice the president acts and is recognised as head of state while conducting official visits abroad, as the Council (also by convention) does not leave the country &quot;in corpore&quot;. More often, though, official visits abroad are carried out by the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. Visiting heads of state are received by the Federal Council &quot;in corpore&quot;.

=== Council meetings ===

The Federal Council operates mainly through weekly meetings, which are held each Wednesday at the Federal Palace in Bern, the seat of the Swiss federal government.

Apart from the seven Councillors, the following officials also attend the meetings:
*Federal Chancellor: Viktor Rossi. As government chief of staff and head of the Federal Chancellery, he participates in the discussion but has no vote in the council&#x27;s decisions. Nonetheless, his influential position is often referred to as that of an &quot;eighth Federal Councillor&quot;.
* the Vice-Chancellor: André Simonazzi. Simonazzi is the spokesman of the Federal Council and conducts the weekly press briefing after the meeting.
* the Vice-Chancellor: Jörg De Bernardi who is in charge of the Federal Council sector within the Swiss Federal Chancellery.

During the meetings, the Councillors address each other formally (e.g. Mrs. Sommaruga, Mr. Berset), even though they are on first name terms with each other. This is done to separate the items on the agenda from the person promoting them.

After the meetings, the Councillors take lunch together. The council also meets regularly in to discuss important topics at length; it annually conducts what is colloquially referred to as its &quot;field trip&quot;, a day trip to some attractions in the President&#x27;s home canton. In that and other respects, the council operates like a board of directors of a major corporation.

=== Decisions and responsibilities ===
Each Federal Councillor heads a government department, much like the ministers in the governments of other countries. Colloquially and by the press (especially outside Switzerland), they are often referred to as ministers even though no such post formally exists. For example, the head of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports is often called &quot;the Swiss defence minister&quot;, even though no such post officially exists. However, as council members, they are not only responsible for their own department, but also for the business of their colleagues&#x27; departments, as well as for the conduct of the government and the federal administration as a whole.

Decisions to be taken by the council are always prepared by the responsible department. Accordingly, a change in the salaries of federal employees would be proposed to the council by the head of the Federal Department of Finance, to whose department the Federal Office of Personnel belongs. Before a vote is taken at a council meeting, though, all proposals are circulated in writing to the heads of departments, who commission the senior career officials of their department – the heads of the Federal Offices – to prepare a written response to offer criticism and suggestions. This is called the &quot;co-report procedure&quot; (&quot;Mitberichtsverfahren&quot;/&quot;procédure de co-rapport&quot;), designed to build a wide consensus ahead of a council meeting.

To prepare for important decisions, an additional public consultation is sometimes conducted, to which the cantons, the political parties and major interest groups are invited, and in which all members of the public can participate. If a change in a federal statute is to be proposed to the Federal Assembly, this step is mandated by law. In such cases, the consultation procedure also serves to identify political concerns that could later be the focus of a popular referendum to stop passage of the bill at issue.

The decisions themselves are formally taken by voice vote by a majority of the Councillors present at a meeting. However, the great majority of decisions are arrived at by consensus; even though lately there is said to be a trend towards more contentious discussions and close votes.

=== Secrecy ===
The meetings of the Federal Council and the result of the votes taken are not open to the public, and the records remain sealed for 50 years. This has lately been the subject of some criticism. In particular, the parties at the ends of the political spectrum argue that this secrecy is contrary to the principle of transparency. However, the council has always maintained that secrecy is necessary to arrive at consensus and to preserve the collegiality and political independence of the individual Councillors.

=== Constitutional conventions ===
Due to the Federal Council&#x27;s unique nature as a voluntary grand coalition of political opponents, its operation is subject to numerous constitutional conventions. Most notable is the principle of collegiality; that is, the Councillors are not supposed to publicly criticise one another, even though they are often political opponents. In effect, they are expected to publicly support all decisions of the council, even against their own personal opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained after the 2003 elections (see below).

=== Travels abroad ===
Due to the fact that technically no sole federal councillor but rather the entire council in corpore is the Swiss head of state, Federal Councillors did for a long time not travel abroad in official business. In other countries, Switzerland was nearly exclusively represented by diplomats.

After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Federal Councillors convened an urgent meeting, where they discussed sending a Councillor to Kennedy&#x27;s funeral. Given that the absence of the Swiss government would not be understood by the population, they decided to send Friedrich Traugott Wahlen. On his travel to the U.S. capital, Wahlen also met with Secretary of State Dean Rusk to discuss tariffs. Despite the opening of Switzerland due to the Kennedy assassination, foreign travels of Federal Councillors were only normalized after the dissolution of the USSR.

== Election and composition ==
The most recent federal council elections were held on 13 December 2023. Federal Council Alain Berset and Federal Chancellor Walter Turnherr had both announced that they would not be seeking reelection. The other Federal Councillors were all reelected, the FDP councillors seats were unsuccessfully attacked by the green party. The following councillors were reelected:

* Guy Parmelin (SVP/VD) since 2016, head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, elected with 215 out of 233 votes cast.
* Ignazio Cassis (FDP/TI) since 2017, head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, elected with 167 out of 239 votes cast.
* Viola Amherd (DM/VS) since 2019, head of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport, elected with 201 out of 228 votes cast. 
* Karin Keller-Sutter (FDP/SG) since 2019, head of the Federal Department of Finance, elected with 176 out of 224 votes cast.
* Albert Rösti (SVP/BE) since 2023, head of the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, elected with 189 out of 217 votes cast.
* Élisabeth Baume-Schneider (SP/JU) since 2023, head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police, elected with 151 out of 216 votes cast.

Following the resignation of Alain Berset as of 31 December 2023, replacement elections were held:
* Beat Jans (SP/BS), elected in the third round of voting with 134 out of 245 votes cast.

In addition, Viktor Rossi (GLP) was newly elected as Federal Chancellor with 135 out of 245 votes cast in the second round of voting. Additionally Viola Amherd was elected President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2024 and Karin Keller-Sutter was elected vice president of the Federal Council for the year 2024. Following the elections there was a departmental reshuffle. Élisabeth Baume-Schneider took over the Federal Department of Home Affairs vacated by Alain Berset and newly elected Beat Jans took over Baume-Schneiders Justice and Police Department.

=== Election mode ===
The members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the Federal Assembly sitting together as the United Federal Assembly. Each Federal Council seat is up for (re-)election in the order of seniority, beginning with the Councillor who had the longest term of office. The office holders are then elected individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of the valid votes. Every adult Swiss citizen is eligible (and could even be elected against his own will), but in practice, only members of Parliament or more rarely, members of cantonal governments, are nominated by the political parties and receive a substantial number of votes. The voting is conducted in several rounds, under a form of exhaustive ballot.
* In the two first rounds, any adult Swiss citizen with voting right is eligible.
* At the issue of the second round, eligible for the third round is anybody who has received at least ten votes.
* At the issue of the third and later rounds (if necessary), the candidates with less than ten votes are excluded, or the candidate with the lowest vote count is excluded. No such exclusion takes place when two or more candidates share a lowest vote count at least equalling 10.

After the election is concluded, the winner holds a short speech and accepts or refuses the office of Federal Councillor. The oath of office is then taken, even then the regular term of office only begins a few weeks later, on 1 January.

Usually, the party which has a seat to fill presents two candidates with mainstream viewpoints to the United Federal Assembly, which then chooses one. This was not so, however, during the 2003 election, which was the most controversial in recent memory. Until the end of the 19th century, it was informally required of Federal Councillors to be elected to the National Council in their canton of origin every four years to put their popularity to a test. This practice was known under the French term of &quot;élection de compliment&quot;. The first Councillor who failed to be reelected (Ulrich Ochsenbein) lost his election to the National Council in 1854.

Once elected, Councillors remain members of their political parties, but hold no leading office with them. In fact, they usually maintain a certain political distance from the party leadership, because under the rules of collegiality, they will often have to publicly promote a council decision which does not match the political conviction of their party (or of themselves).

=== Resignation ===
Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors can neither be voted out of office by a motion of no confidence nor can they be impeached. Reelection is possible for an indefinite number of terms; it has historically been extremely rare for Parliament not to reelect a sitting Councillor. This has only happened four times – to Ulrich Ochsenbein in 1854, to Jean-Jacques Challet-Venel in 1872, to Ruth Metzler in 2003 and to Christoph Blocher in 2007. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.

== Status of Federal Councillors ==
=== Councillors&#x27; lives ===
Unlike most senior members of government in other countries, the Federal Councillors are not entitled to an official residence. However, the Federal Palace houses living apartments for both the Federal Chancellor and President of the Confederation. Mostly, Federal Councillors have chosen to rent apartments or hotel suites in Bern at their own expense. However, they are entitled to use the Federal Council&#x27;s country estate, Lohn, for holidays, and this estate is also used to host official guests of the Swiss Confederation.

While Councillors can draw on an Army security detail if they need personal protection, in particular during official events, they are often encountered without any escort in the streets, restaurants and tramways of Bern. Ueli Maurer was known to use the bicycle on most days from his apartment in Münsingen to the Federal Palace in Bern. Councillors are also entitled to a personal bailiff (&quot;huissier&quot; or &quot;Bundesweibel&quot;) who accompanies them, in a red and white ceremonial uniform, to official events.

The spouses of Councillors do not play an official part in the business of government, apart from accompanying the Councillors to official receptions.

=== Councillors&#x27; salary ===
Federal councillors receive an annual salary of CHF 472,958, plus another CHF 30,000 annually for expenses. The councillors pay tax on this income.

Former councillors with at least four years of service receive a pension equivalent to half the salary of Federal Council members in office. If a councillor leaves office for health reasons, they may receive this pension even if their length of service was less than three years. Councillors who leave their offices after less than four years may also receive a partial pension. After leaving office, &quot;former federal councillors frequently pursue some other lucrative activity,&quot; but &quot;their earnings, when added to the pension they receive as an ex-federal councillor, may not exceed the salary of a federal councillor in office, otherwise their pension is reduced accordingly.&quot;

Serving federal councillors &quot;enjoy a certain number of special benefits, from free telephone contracts to a chauffeur-driven car for official business, a courtesy car for personal use or the use of federal planes and helicopters for official business trips. Each member of the Federal Council also has the right to a first-class SBB GA travelcard (also in retirement). They are also given personal security, which is often very discreet.&quot;
=== Immunity ===
Federal Councillors, like members of parliament, enjoy absolute legal immunity for all statements made in their official capacity.

Prosecution for crimes and misdemeanors that relate to the Councillors&#x27; official capacity requires the assent of the immunity commissions of the Federal Assembly. In such cases, Parliament can also suspend the Councillor in office (but not actually remove them).

According to statements to the media by a Federal Chancellory official, in none of the few cases of accusations against a Federal Councillor has the permission to prosecute ever been granted. Such cases usually involved statements considered offensive by members of the public. However, one unnamed Councillor involved in a traffic accident immediately prior to his date of resignation was reported to have voluntarily waived his immunity, and Councillor Elisabeth Kopp decided to resign upon facing an inquiry over allegations of secrecy violations.

<text>The National Council (, ) is one of the two houses of the Austrian Parliament and is frequently referred to as the lower house. The constitution endows the National Council with far more power than the Federal Council.

==Responsibilities==

The National Council is where Austria&#x27;s federal legislative authority is concentrated; for a bill to become federal law, it must be resolved upon by this chamber. Bills passed by the National Council are sent to the Federal Council for corroboration. If the Federal Council approves of the bill or simply does nothing for eight weeks, the bill has succeeded. If the Federal Council vetoes the bill, the National Council may still force it into law by essentially just passing it again; a National Council resolution overruling a Federal Council objection merely has to meet a higher quorum than a regular resolution. In other words, the Federal Council does not have any real power to prevent adoption of legislation, the National Council being easily able to override it. There are three exceptions to this rule:
* Constitutional laws or regulations limiting the competencies of the federal states
* Laws relating to the rights of the Federal Council itself
* Treaties concerning the jurisdiction of the federal states.

The approval of the National Council is also required for most of the prerogatives of the Federal Assembly to be exercised. For example, motions to call for a referendum aimed at having the President removed from office by the electorate, and motions to declare war all need a two-thirds majority in the National Council. Only motions to impeach the President can also be from the Federal Council.

==Elections==
The 183 members of the National Council are elected by nationwide popular vote for a term of five years; each Austrian sixteen years or older on the day the election takes place is entitled to one vote. National Council elections are general elections. The voting system aims at party-list proportional representation and uses partially open lists:
* For the purpose of National Council elections, the nine states of Austria constitute regional electoral districts. The nine regional electoral districts are subdivided into a total of 39 local electoral districts. Political parties submit separate ranked lists of candidates for each district, regional or local, in which they have chosen to run. They also submit a federal-level list.
* Votes cast are first counted within their local electoral districts. Since there are 39 local districts but 183 seats to fill, most local districts are multi-member districts. The number of seats assigned to each local district is based solely on electoral district population, as established by the most recent census; the partitioning and apportionment rules are simple enough to prevent gerrymandering from becoming an issue. The number of votes required to win one seat is simply the number of votes divided by the number of seats assigned to the district in question (ie the Hare quota). For example, if 150,000 votes are cast in a five-seat local district, it takes 30,000 votes to win one seat. If a party has scored 61,000 votes out of the 150,000 votes cast, it is entitled to two seats, to be taken by the first two candidates on the party&#x27;s local district list. Since 60,000 votes would have been sufficient to win two seats, 1000 votes are left unaccounted for by this first round of tallying.
* Any vote not accounted for on the local level is dealt with on the regional level, provided that the party it has been cast for has obtained at least four percent of the regional total vote. The system is analogous to that used on the district level; the number of seats assigned to a regional district is simply the number of seats assigned to one of its constituent local districts but not filled during the first round of tallying.
* Any vote not accounted for on the regional level either is dealt with on the federal level, provided that the party it has been cast for has obtained at least four percent of the federal total vote. The D&#x27;Hondt method is used to allocate any National Council seats remaining to be filled.

In addition to voting for a party list, voters may express preference for one individual candidate in the same party list. This means it is not possible to simultaneously vote for the party list of one party but exert influence on the candidate rankings on the party list of another party. A candidate receiving sufficiently many personal votes can rise in rank on his or her district party list; voters thus have a certain degree of influence as to which particular individual wins which particular seat.

==Peculiarities==
Austria&#x27;s federal constitution defines Austria as a semi-presidential democracy: the executive branch of government is supposed to be headed by the President, but is also answerable to the National Council. In practice, however, nearly all of the day-to-day work of governing is left to the Chancellor and Cabinet, which are dependent on the confidence of the National Council. The President has the theoretical right to name anyone eligible to serve in the National Council as a minister or Chancellor. However, the National Council&#x27;s right to sack a minister or the entire cabinet makes it all but impossible for Presidents to appoint a government entirely of their own choosing or keep it in office against the will of the National Council. While the President has the theoretical authority to dissolve a hostile National Council, constitutional convention prevents this power from being exercised.

Austria accordingly functions as a parliamentary democracy: for all intents and purposes, the cabinet is subject to approval by the National Council and is responsible to it, with the president being little more than a figurehead.

A related discrepancy between Austrian constitutional theory and Austrian political practice is that the constitution defines the President of the National Council to be Austria&#x27;s second highest public official, junior only to the president proper. As a practical matter, however, the Chancellor, who nominally ranks third in the Austrian order of precedence, is the country&#x27;s leading political figure. Thus, the President of the National Council is a representative of rather moderate significance: wielding less power than the president by extension means wielding less power than the Chancellor or even most federal ministers. The President of the National Council thus serves mostly as a moderator of parliamentary debate.

<text>The Federal Council (, ) is the upper house of the Austrian Parliament, representing the nine States of Austria at the federal level. As part of a bicameral legislature alongside the National Council, it can be compared with an upper house or a senate. In fact, however, it is far less powerful than the National Council: although it has to approve every new law decided for by this lower chamber, the latter can – in most cases – overrule the Federal Council&#x27;s refusal to approve.

The &quot;Bundesrat&quot; has its seat at the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna. Since 2023, it meets in a chamber formerly used by the National Council&#x27;s budget committee. During a major renovation of the parliament building from 2017 until 2023, the Federal Council met in the Hofburg Palace.

==Role==
As the Constitution of Austria (B-VG) draws a strict distinction between federal and state legislation, its Article 42 provides the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; only with the right to veto federal laws passed by the National Council. Moreover, in most cases a Federal Council&#x27;s veto is just suspensive, meaning the National Council can override it, passing the law again by ordinary resolution of at least half of its members. Therefore, the decisions of the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; can only delay legislation.

In the following cases, though, the Federal Council&#x27;s approval is mandatory:
* Constitutional laws or regulations limiting the competencies of the federal states
* Laws relating to the rights of the Federal Council itself
* Treaties concerning the jurisdiction of the federal states.

Since its inauguration on 10 November 1920, the deputies of &quot;Bundesrat&quot; have never achieved the status of a counterbalance in relation to the National Council. Over the decades the role of the Federal Council as a mere adjunct of the Austrian parliament has led to several discussions upon regulatory reforms, towards an actual representation of the states&#x27; governments modeled on the German Bundesrat or the complete abolition of the second chamber. So far, the concept has been maintained as a manifestation of Austria&#x27;s federal system.

The Federal Council and the National Council, if in joint session, form a third parliamentary body: the Federal Assembly that convenes for the oath of office of the President of Austria.

==Composition==
The 60 members of the Federal Council (&quot;Mitglieder des Bundesrats&quot;, colloquially called &quot;Bundesräte&quot;) are elected according to proportional representation by each of the Austrian states&#x27; legislatures (&quot;Landtage&quot;) for 5- to 6-year terms. The composition of the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; therefore changes after every state election and the distribution of seats in the Austrian Landtage. The second largest faction of the particular &quot;Landtag&quot; has the right to designate at least one deputy. The number of representatives delegated by each &quot;Bundesland&quot; (state within the country) ranges between three and twelve, depending on its population as ascertained by a regular census; it is fixed per presidential decree.

The deputies may ally along party lines and form parliamentary groups, which have to meet a quorum of five seats, if not admitted by particular resolution. Currently the MPs of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and The Greens form political groups (&quot;Fraktionen&quot;) in the &quot;Bundesrat.&quot; Although there is a NEOS member, political groups require 5 members: 
The President of the Federal Council is nominated by the largest party of each state in semi-yearly intervals.

== Presidency ==
== Presidium ==
The Federal Council is made up of a president (elected for a term of half a year) and 2 vice-presidents.

== History ==
In February 2019, the Federal Council prevented a bill from being passed for the first time in its history. An amendment to the Green Electricity Act was rejected, with all 21 SPÖ deputies voting against it. This rejection was possible because the law being voted on would have restricted the competences of the states.

<text>The Grumman S-2 Tracker (S2F prior to 1962) is the first purpose-built, single airframe anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft to enter service with the United States Navy. Designed and initially built by Grumman, the Tracker was of conventional design — propeller-driven with twin radial engines, a high wing that could be folded for storage on aircraft carriers, and tricycle undercarriage. The type was exported to a number of navies around the world. Introduced in 1952, the Tracker and its E-1 Tracer derivative saw service in the U.S. Navy until the mid-1970s, and its C-1 Trader derivative until the mid-1980s, with a few aircraft remaining in service with other air arms into the 21st century. Argentina is the last country to still operate the Tracker.

==Design and development==
The Tracker was intended as a replacement for the Grumman AF Guardian, which was the first purpose-built aircraft system for anti-submarine warfare. The Guardian operated in two aircraft &quot;hunter-killer&quot; pairs, with one aircraft (the AF2-W) carrying the detection gear to find the submarine and to direct the second aircraft, the AF-2S, which carried weapons to attack and destroy the submarine. The Tracker combined both functions in one aircraft, saving deck space aboard carriers and making for more efficient operations. Grumman&#x27;s design (model G-89) was for a large high-wing monoplane with twin Wright Cyclone R-1820 nine cylinder radial engines, a yoke type arrestor hook and a crew of four. Both the two XS2F-1 prototypes and 15 S2F-1 production aircraft were ordered at the same time, on 30 June 1950. The first flight was conducted on 4 December 1952, and production aircraft entered service with VS-26, in February 1954.

Follow-on versions included the WF Tracer and TF Trader, which became the Grumman E-1 Tracer and Grumman C-1 Trader in the tri-service designation standardization of 1962. The S-2 carried the nickname &quot;Stoof&quot; (S-two-F) throughout its military career; and the E-1 Tracer variant with the large overhead radome was colloquially called the &quot;stoof with a roof.&quot;.

Grumman produced 1,185 Trackers and another 99 aircraft carrying the CS2F designation were manufactured in Canada under license by de Havilland Canada. U.S.-built versions of the Tracker were sold to various nations, including Australia, Japan, Turkey and Taiwan.

===Sensors and armament===
The Tracker had an internal torpedo bay capable of carrying two lightweight aerial torpedoes or one nuclear depth charge. There were six underwing hard points for rocket pods and conventional depth charges or up to four additional torpedoes. A ventrally-mounted retractable radome for AN/APS-38 radar and a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) AN/ASQ-8 mounted on an extendable rear mounted boom were also fitted. Early model Trackers had an Electronic Support Measures (ESM) pod mounted dorsally just aft of the front seat overhead hatches and were also fitted with a smoke particle detector or &quot;sniffer&quot; for detecting exhaust particles from diesel-electric submarines running on snorkel. Later S-2s had the sniffer removed and had the ESM antennae moved to four rounded extensions on the wingtips. A 70-million-candlepower searchlight was mounted on the starboard wing. The engine nacelles carried JEZEBEL sonobuoys in the rear (16 in early marks, 32 in the S-2E/G). Early Trackers also carried 60 explosive charges, dispensed ventrally from the rear of the fuselage and used to create sound pulses for semi-active sonar (JULIE) with the AN/AQA-3 and later AQA-4 detection sets, whereas the introduction of active sonobuoys (pingers) and AN/AQA-7 with the S-2G conversion saw these removed. Smoke dispensers were mounted on the port ventral surface of the nacelles in groups of three each.

==Operational history==
The Tracker was eventually superseded in U.S. military service by the Lockheed S-3 Viking; the last USN Tracker operational squadron (VS-37 with S-2G models) was disestablished in 1976. The last Navy S-2 was withdrawn from service on 29 August 1976. For many years the TS-2A version of the Tracker was used by U.S. Navy training units, culminating with its use by Training Squadron 27 (VT-27), Training Squadron 28 (VT-28) and Training Squadron 31 (VT-31) for Student Naval Aviator training in the multi-engine pipeline with Training Air Wing FOUR (TRAWING 4) at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas.

A number of Trackers live on as firefighting aircraft while the design also continued to provide excellent service with the naval forces of other countries for years after the U.S. retired them. For example, the Royal Australian Navy continued to use Trackers as front line ASW assets until the mid-1980s.

===Argentina===
Argentine Naval Aviation received seven S-2As in 1962, six S-2Es in 1978, and three S-2Gs in the 1990s. They were operated from both aircraft carriers, and , and used in the carrier onboard delivery (COD) (US-2A conversions,) maritime patrol, and ASW roles. They were extensively used in the 1982 Falklands War, first from &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;, from where they detected the British task force, and then from the mainland when the carrier returned to port after the sinking of the cruiser . In the 1990s, six remaining airframes were refurbished by Israel Aerospace Industries with turboprop engines as S-2T Turbo Trackers. with the retirement of Argentina&#x27;s only aircraft carrier, the Trackers were annually deployed on board Brazilian Navy aircraft carrier during joint exercises ARAEX and TEMPEREX. and with U.S. Navy aircraft carriers during Gringo-Gaucho maneuvers. at least one S-2T was reported still operational in the maritime surveillance role.

===Australia===

Between 1967 and 1984 the Royal Australian Navy operated two Squadrons of S-2E and S-2G variants, based at NAS Nowra (). These aircraft served with the RAN&#x27;s 816 Squadron, which embarked aboard the as part of the 21st Carrier Air Group whenever that ship was deployed; and with 851 Squadron, the S-2 training squadron.

Australia initially acquired 14 S-2Es. During approximately 17 years of operation of the Tracker, the RAN lost only one S-2 during aircraft operations due to an accident at sea on 10 February 1975. However, on 4 December 1976, a deliberately lit fire in a hangar at Nowra destroyed or badly damaged a large proportion of the RAN&#x27;s complement of Trackers. Of the 14 original aircraft, one was away from Nowra undergoing maintenance at the time of the fire and three aircraft were damaged but only two of these were repaired. The destroyed aircraft were subsequently replaced with 16 ex-USN aircraft. The replacement aircraft were all S-2Gs, including the original aircraft modified by the USN to that status. This saw the introduction of AQA-7 acoustic gear into RAN service and all RAN operational Trackers were subsequently modified to this standard.

===Brazil===
The Brazilian Air Force flew Trackers from the aircraft carrier NAeL . Both the S-2A and S-2E were used (respectively as P-16A and P-16E). At the end of its service in Brazilian Air Force, one S-2T Turbo Tracker was evaluated as a possible upgrade, but due high costs the program was canceled. However, in 2010 the Brazilian Navy contracted Marsh Aviation to convert four S-2Ts to Airborne Early Warning configuration and upgrade four additional Grumman C-1 Traders for tanking and carrier onboard delivery transport duties. The latter were scheduled to be back in service by 2015 and were expected to operate from the successor of &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;, NAe &quot;São Paulo&quot;. Following the bankruptcy of Marsh Aviation in 2009 the program suffered delays and the upgrade of the airframes was resumed in partnership with Elbit Systems&#x27;s subsidiary, M7 Aerospace. The decommissioning of the São Paulo in 2017 means that the Brazilian Navy does not have an immediate need for carrier-based tankers, transports and AEW aircraft, however the navy proceeded with procurement and the delivery of four tanker aircraft are expected by 2021.

As noted under Argentina above, Trackers of that country have been flown from the &quot;São Paulo&quot; until its decommissioning in early 2017.

===Canada===
In 1954, de Havilland Canada (DHC) entered into a contract to build 100 Trackers under license to replace the outmoded Grumman TBM-3E Avengers being used by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). 99 Trackers were actually built by DHC, with the first Canadian-built aircraft flying on 31 May 1956. From 1957 onwards, these aircraft operated from the newly deployed aircraft carrier and various shore bases. All the Canadian Trackers were built to the earlier &quot;A&quot; model airframe design with a length of (c.f. for later model Trackers) in order to fit in &quot;Bonaventure&quot;″s hangar. In 1960–1961, 17 CS2F-1 aircraft, which had been relegated to training and utility duties by the CS2F-2, were transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy. From 1964, 45 CS2F-2s were upgraded by fitting revised electronic equipment and sensors, becoming CS2F-3s. Also in 1964, a pair of CS2F-1 aircraft were stripped of armament and ASW electronics, converted to transports, and subsequently used for carrier onboard delivery. The CS2F-1, -2, and -3 were redesignated as the CP-121 Mk.1, Mk. 2, and Mk. 3 respectively following the unification of Canadian forces in 1968.

After &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was decommissioned in 1970, all remaining Canadian Trackers were transferred to shore bases. This limited their usefulness for ASW patrols, and between 1974 and 1981 gradually all but 20 were placed in storage and the remainder were stripped of their ASW gear. The remaining active-duty Trackers served until 1990 on fisheries protection and maritime patrol duties. A handful of Trackers were kept in flying condition until the late 1990s but were no longer used for active service.

DHC purchased a single U.S.-built S2F-1 from Grumman for testing avionics and anti-submarine systems and also for evaluating Engineering Change Proposals created by Grumman; it was initially given RCN serial number &quot;1500&quot; and counted as one of the 100 contracted airframes. In 1954, this aircraft was transferred to the RCN for operational testing, and assigned the test code &quot;X-500&quot;. In 1956, it was upgraded to CS2F-1 standards and assigned serial number &quot;1501;&quot; it was last used as a stationary instructional airframe at Shearwater until 1972. It is not known whether this aircraft was ever assigned a U.S. Navy bureau number.

===Japan===
The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force received 60 S2F-1s in 1957 from U.S. stocks, and they were operated until 1984. After being received, six S2F-1s were reconfigured into four S2F-U and two S2F-C variants. The S2F-1 was nicknamed &quot;Aotaka (あおたか, Blue Hawk)&quot;. They were replaced by the Lockheed P-3 Orion.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands Naval Aviation Service (Marineluchtvaartdienst - MLD), the air arm of the Royal Netherlands Navy, received 28 S-2A (S2F-1) aircraft under MDAP from the US Navy in 1960. An additional 17 Canadian-built CS-2A (CS2F-1) aircraft formerly operated by the Royal Canadian Navy were delivered between December 1960 and September 1961 after being overhauled by Fairey Canada. These aircraft were operated from Valkenburg Naval Air Base as well as from the light aircraft carrier until a fire in 1968 took that ship out of Dutch service.

A total of 18 aircraft were converted to S-2N (for Netherlands) standard by Fairey Canada in 1968–1970 for ASW and MR use with 1 Sqn (at Hato International Airport), of which four were converted to US-2N trainer/transport standards in May 1971. Most of the de Havilland Canada-built CS-2As were scrapped by 1970 or used for ground instruction. The last Tracker in MLD service was withdrawn in January 1976, with some transferred to the Turkish Navy.

===Peru===
The Peruvian Navy operated with S-2E and S-2G from 1975 until 1989, they were assigned to Naval Aviation Squadron N°12 (Escuadron Aeronaval N°12). A total of 12 S-2Es were bought from the U.S. Navy in 1975 and 4 S-2G in 1983.

===Taiwan===
The Republic of China Air Force initially operated the S-2A in 1967. In 1976, they received S-2Es. The S-2As were later converted into target aircraft and later decommissioned in batches from 1979 to 1992. In 1986, several S-2Gs were purchased to make up for attrition. A modernization program began the same year, converting the remaining S-2E/G to a military S-2T configuration. The conversion involved the installation of two Garrett/Honeywell TPE-331-15AW turboprop engines, each rated at 1,227 kW (1,645 shp), with four-blade propellers This resulted in a payload increase of 500 kg. The upgrade also included new mission equipment of AN/AQS-92F digital sonobuoy processor, A/NARR-84 99-channel sonobuoy receiver, Litton AN/APS-504 radar, AN/ASQ-504 MAD and AN/AAS-40 FLIR.

The 27 S-2Ts upgraded were transferred to the ROCN Aviation Command on 1 July 1999. In 2013, the S-2s were transferred back into ROCAF service. In May 2017, all S-2Ts were withdrawn from active service.

===Turkey===
The Turkish Navy received a number of ex-U.S. Navy S-2E Trackers under the MAP program and operated them from the Cengiz Topel Naval Air Base starting in the 1960s. These were later supplemented by retired S-2A (or S-2N as called by the Dutch) airframes from Netherlands. Turkish Trackers were retired in 1994 after a series of accidents caused by the advanced age and fatigue of the airframes.

===Uruguay===
The Uruguayan Navy received the first three S-2A Trackers on 10 April 1965 at the Capitan Curbelo Navy Base. On 15 September 1982, one S-2G arrived. On 2 February 1983, another two S-2Gs arrived. By September 2004, the remaining Uruguayan Trackers were not in flight condition.

===Civilian use===
From the late 1970s until the mid-1990s Conair Aviation of Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada took possession of retired Canadian and U.S. Trackers and converted them into Firecats, with a four-door fire retardant tank replacing the weapons bay and adjacent mid-fuselage section. Firecats were made in two variants: the piston-engined Firecat and the turboprop-powered Turbo Firecat.

In 1958, CAL FIRE, then CDF, contracted with a private air tanker service for the use of their converted World War II aircraft. By 1970 the department began to evaluate the use of former military Grumman S-2 aircraft. Over the next ten years CAL FIRE continued to build up its fleet of S-2A air tankers and in 1987, CAL FIRE began the process of converting their piston engines to turboprop. By 2005 all of CAL FIRE&#x27;s airtanker fleet had been converted to S-2T air tankers.

==== Turkey ====
The Tracker was considered for Turkey&#x27;s firefighting aircraft project. The project, which began in the late 1990s, never went beyond the conversion of a single prototype. The Turkish Navy had retired its entire Tracker fleet 1994, so these aircraft were readily available for modification. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) undertook a study in 1997 to investigate if it was possible to convert any of these S-2Es for firefighting. After re-engining with Honeywell TPE331 turboprop engines, at a cost of about $3 million per aircraft, it was expected to provide at least twenty years of service.

TAI ordered an S-2T Turbo Tracker upgrade kit for conversion of one of the S-2Es. Following its conversion in 1999, the aircraft was used during the 1999 Antalya wildfires and the Tüpraş Izmit Oil Refinery fire, started after the 1999 İzmit earthquake. Although up to fifteen aircraft were intended to be converted, the project was cancelled in 2002 for unclear reasons. TAI&#x27;s Flight Test Engineering Group flew the lone converted aircraft as a testbed for new technology until the mid-2010s.

<text>The Ansel Adams Wilderness is a wilderness area in the Sierra Nevada of California, United States. The wilderness spans ; 33.9% of the territory lies in the Inyo National Forest, 65.8% is in the Sierra National Forest, and the remaining 0.3% covers nearly all of Devils Postpile National Monument. Yosemite National Park lies to the north and northwest, while the John Muir Wilderness lies to the south.

==History==
The wilderness was established as part of the original Wilderness Act in 1964 as the Minarets Wilderness. The Minarets Wilderness was created by enlarging and renaming the Mount Dana-Minarets Primitive Area.

In 1984, after his death, the area was expanded and renamed in memory of Ansel Adams, well-known environmentalist and nature photographer who is famous for his black-and-white landscape photographs of the Sierra Nevada.

==Geography and geology==
The Ansel Adams wilderness spans in elevation from , forming the northern end of the High Sierra.

The centerpiece of the Ansel Adams wilderness is the Ritter Range, which includes dark metavolcanic glaciated mountains such as Mount Ritter, Banner Peak, and The Minarets.

Immediately to the east of the Ritter Range is the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, which contains Devils Postpile, a series of basaltic columns that were revealed and smoothed by glacier action. The Middle Fork originates from Thousand Island Lake, at the foot of Banner Peak, one of the largest backcountry lakes in the Sierra.

To the east of the Middle Fork canyon is the true Sierra Crest, which, at roughly of elevation is lower than the Ritter Range. This relatively low region of the Crest allows winter storms through and cause large amounts of snowfall on Mammoth Mountain, which sits in the gap. The gap also allows migration of plants and animals across the Sierra Crest.

To the west of the Ritter Range lies the canyon of the North Fork of the San Joaquin, a relatively remote and unvisited high-country area. The southern part of the wilderness contains the deep canyon of the main San Joaquin River, which flows out of the Sierra Nevada to California&#x27;s Central Valley.
==Climate==
==Ecology==
The Ansel Adams wilderness contains substantial area above treeline, at approximately . The area above treeline contains alpine meadows and fellfields, with a large number of glacial lakes. Below treeline, the wilderness is dominated by lodgepole pine, red fir, and Jeffrey pine, depending on elevation.
==Recreation==
The wilderness contains of hiking trails, including portions of the John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails. The Sierra High Route, an off-trail route described by Steve Roper, runs along the base of the Ritter Range, through the wilderness.

The Middle Fork of the San Joaquin receives the most visitors: a mandatory bus is required for visitors to reach Devils Postpile from the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area during the summer.

The Minarets are a well-known area for technical rock climbing.

Winter brings various cross-country ski possibilities, accessible from both Mammoth Mountain and the June Mountain ski area.

<doc id="218319" wikidata="Q146138" url="?curid=218319" title="German Bundesrat">
<text>The German Bundesrat (, ) is a legislative body that represents the sixteen &quot;Länder&quot; (federated states) of Germany at the federal level (German: &quot;Bundesebene&quot;). The Bundesrat meets at the former Prussian House of Lords in Berlin. Its second seat is located in the former West German capital of Bonn.

The Bundesrat legislates alongside the Bundestag. The Bundesrat consists of members appointed by state governments and the Bundestag consists of representatives directly elected by the German people. Certain laws and all constitutional changes need the consent of both houses. For its somewhat similar function, the Bundesrat is sometimes (controversially) described as an upper house of parliament along the lines of the United States Senate, the Canadian Senate, Australian Senate, and the British House of Lords.

The name &quot;Bundesrat&quot; was used by similar bodies in the North German Confederation (1867) and the German Empire (1871). The predecessor of the Bundesrat in the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) was the Reichsrat.

The political makeup of the Bundesrat is affected by changes in power in the states of Germany, and thus by elections in each state. Each state delegation in the Bundesrat is appointed by the state government. In contrast to most parliaments, the members of the Bundesrat do not have a free mandate and all members of a state delegation have to vote the same way in each vote. The Bundesrat is a continuous body and has no legislative periods. For organizational reasons, the Bundesrat structures its legislative calendar in years of business (&quot;Geschäftsjahre&quot;), beginning each year on 1 November. Each year of business is congruous with the one-year-term of the Presidium of the Bundesrat. The sessions have been counted continuously since the first session on 7 September 1949. The Bundesrat&#x27;s 1,000th plenary meeting took place on 12 February 2021 and was opened with a speech by President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

== History ==
=== German Confederation ===
The historical predecessor of the Bundesrat was the Federal Convention (Confederate Diet) of the German Confederation (1815–1848, 1850/1851–1866). That Federal Convention consisted of the representatives of the member states. The first basic law (Bundesakte) of the German Confederation listed how many votes a member state had, for two different formations of the diet. The diet was the only organ – there was no division of powers. The diet was chaired by the Austrian representative.

In the revolution of 1848 the Bundestag transferred its powers to the Imperial Regent and was reactivated only in 1850/1851. Several other attempts to reform the Confederation involved retaining the Bundestag and adding a parliament and a court. One of these attempts, the proposed Reform Act of 1863, had introduced the term &quot;Bundesrath&quot;. With the dissolution of the Confederation in August 1866, the diet and the federal law ended.

=== North German Confederation and German Empire (1867–1918) ===

On 1 July 1867 the North German Confederation was established as a confederal state. The Reichstag, elected by the North German men, was one legislative body. The other one was the Bundesrath (old spelling). This organ was expressly modelled after the old diet. When the Confederation was transformed and renamed &quot;Deutsches Reich&quot; (German Empire) in 1871, the Bundesrat kept its name.

Whilst appointed by state governments just as today, the delegates of the original Bundesrat—as those of the Reichsrat—were usually high-ranking civil servants, not cabinet members. The original Bundesrat was very powerful; it had the right of legislative initiative and every bill (including the budget) needed its consent, equaling it to the popularly elected Reichstag. It could also, with the Emperor&#x27;s agreement, dissolve the Reichstag.

=== Weimar Republic (1918/19–1933) ===
In the revolution of 1918, the revolutionary organ (&quot;Council of People&#x27;s Representatives&quot;) limited the power of the Bundesrat to its administrative functions. A (committee of states) accompanied the reform of Germany but had no official role in installing the new constitution. Under that Weimar Constitution, ratified on 11 August 1919, it was replaced by the (1919–1934).

The of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) had considerably less influence, since it could only veto bills—and even then be overruled by the . However, overruling the needed a majority of two-thirds in the , which consisted of many parties differing in opinion. So, in most cases, bills vetoed by the failed due to the lack of unity among the &#x27;s constituent parties. The was abolished by the &quot;Law on the Abolition of the Reichsrat&quot; on 14 February 1934, roughly a year after Hitler had come to power.

=== Federal Republic (since 1949) ===
With the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany after the Second World War and the adoption of the Basic Law as the new constitution, the chamber of states was re-established, again under the name &#x27;Bundesrat&#x27;. The new Bundesrat, in terms of its power, occupies an intermediate position between the very powerful Bundesrat of the empire and the relatively weak Reichsrat of the Weimar Republic. The Bundesrat now once again has the right of legislative initiative, but its absolute right of veto applies only to certain laws that directly affect the federal states; otherwise its vetos can be overruled by the Bundestag with an absolute majority. The latter also applies to the federal budget.

== Tasks ==
===Legislative process===
The Bundesrat is one of three constitutional bodies (along with the Bundestag and the federal government) that have the right of initiative for the legislative process. In addition, government legislative initiatives must be formally brought to the attention of the Bundesrat, which has to respond to them with a statement. The bill can only be discussed in the Bundestag once this statement has been made (so the Bundesrat does not yet vote on the motion here, but it can significantly delay it). Conversely, a bill proposed by the Bundesrat must first be submitted to the Federal Government for a statement before the Bundestag can deal with it. When the Bundestag has finally approved a bill, it is forwarded to the Bundesrat. There are two possibilities here: 
*If a proposed law directly affects the states or if they would have to participate in its enforcement, it is called an &#x27;approval bill&#x27;: The Bundesrat must approve such the bill by a majority vote in order for it to become a law. 
*If the stated condition is not met, one speaks of a &#x27;objection bill&#x27;: Such bill becomes a law, if the Bundesrat does not object to it. However, the Bundestag can overrule the objection with a majority of its members (Chancellor&#x27;s majority). Only if the Bundesrat lodges an objection with a two-thirds majority, the rejection of the bill is final.
The two variants differ significantly because, due to the special voting procedures in the Bundesrat, a positive vote is always more difficult to achieve than a negative one. This is because a majority of all possible votes (currently 35 out of 69) is always required for a positive vote. A delegation can only vote yes on a motion if there is a consensus in the respective state government. If such a consensus does not exist (which is often the case, as most state governments are multi party coalitions), the delegation must abstain, which in effect has the same result as a no vote. In short, for approval bills a majority must be present in the Bundesrat, while for objection laws it is sufficient if no majority is formed against them.

Under no circumstances can the Bundesrat amend a bill. However, in the case of ‘approval laws’ in particular, if the Bundesrat rejects a bill, the matter is often referred to the so-called mediation committee, a body made up of an equal number of members of the Bundestag and Bundesrat, which attempts to negotiate whether the bill can find the approval of both chambers with certain amendments. A version amended in this way must then be passed again by a majority in both chambers in order to become law (in this case the rules of procedure of both chambers provide for an abbreviated legislative procedure).

One important difference between the Bundesrat and an upper house in a true bicameral legislature is that the Bundesrat always decides on a bill only &quot;after&quot; the Bundestag and can adopt it only in the form adopted by the Bundestag – even if the bill originated in the Bundesrat itself. It is even possible for the Bundesrat to first propose a bill and then reject it after the law has been passed in the Bundestag because the majority in the chamber has changed in the meantime.

===Election of judges to the federal constitutional court===
The Bundesrat shares responsibility with the Bundestag for electing the judges of the Federal Constitutional Court. Both chambers elect four judges to each of the court&#x27;s two senates. They also elect the president and vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court in alternating order. This requires a two-thirds majority, which currently stands at 46 of 69 votes.

===Emergency powers===
The Bundesrat also has certain powers that can be brought to use in special states of emergency.

*In the event of an internal emergency, e.g. a natural disaster, the federal government can deploy the armed forces to support the police forces of the federal states and the federal police in protecting civilian objects and fighting organised and military armed insurgents. The Federal Government can then order the police of a federal state and the police forces of other federal states to follow its instructions and deploy units of the federal police if the endangered federal state is not willing or able to combat the danger itself. However, the Bundesrat can prohibit the Federal Government from doing so by majority decision.
*If a vote of confidence by the Chancellor fails and the Federal President does not dissolve the Bundestag, the President may, at the request of the Chancellor and with the consent of the Bundesrat, declare a legislative emergency.
If the Bundestag then rejects a bill designated by the government as urgent, or adopts it in a version designated by the federal government as unacceptable, the law shall be deemed to have been passed if the Bundesrat approves it. The Basic Law cannot be amended, repealed or suspended, either in whole or in part, by means of this procedure. This legislative emergency is limited to a period of six months and can only be declared once during a Chancellor&#x27;s term of office.

== Seat ==

From 1894 to 1933, the Bundesrat/Reichsrat met in the same building as the Reichstag, today known as &quot;Reichstagsgebäude&quot;. After 1949, the Bundesrat gathered in the &quot;Bundeshaus&quot; in Bonn, along with the Bundestag, at least most of the time. A wing of the Bundeshaus was specially built for the Bundesrat.

In 2000, the Bundesrat moved to Berlin, as the Bundestag had done the year before. The Berlin seat of the Bundesrat is the former Prussian House of Lords building. The Bundesrat wing in Bonn is still used as a second seat.

== Composition ==

=== Historically ===
For the Federal Diet of 1815, the basic law (Bundesakte) established two different formations. In the Plenary, for the most important decisions, every state had at least one vote. The larger states Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hannover and Württemberg had four votes each; eight lesser states two or three, and the remaining 25 had only one vote.

The North German Confederation was a different entity from the German Confederation, but it can also be regarded as the brainchild of a long lasting reform debate within the German Confederation. The new Bundesrat even referred to the old diet in Article 6, when it redistributed the votes for each states. Prussia, originally with four votes, gained the votes of the states it had annexed in 1866, i.e. Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Holstein, Nassau, and Frankfurt, totaling 17 votes. The total number of votes in 1867 was 43 votes.

When the South German states joined in 1870/71, the revised federal constitutions allocated new votes for them. Bavaria had six votes, Württemberg four, Baden three, and (the whole of) Hesse-Darmstadt three. The total number went up to 58 votes, and in 1911, with three new votes for Alsace-Lorraine, to 61 votes. The Prussian votes remained 17.

To put the Prussian votes in context: 80% of North Germans lived in Prussia, and after 1871, Prussia made up two thirds of the German population and territory. Prussia was always underrepresented in the Bundesrat. 

=== Weimar Republic ===
The Reichsrat, as a first, had no fixed numbers of votes for the member states. Instead, it introduced the principle that the number depended on the actual number of inhabitants. Originally, states had one vote for every 1 million inhabitants. In 1921, this was reduced to 700,000 inhabitants per vote.

No state was allowed to have more than 40 percent of the votes. This was regarded as a &quot;clausula antiborussica&quot;, counterbalancing the dominant position of Prussia, which still contained roughly two-thirds of the German population. Also, since 1921, half of the Prussian votes were not cast by the Prussian state government but by the administrations of the Prussian provinces.

For example, of the 63 votes in 1919, Prussia had 25 votes, Bavaria seven, and Saxony five. 12 states had only one vote each.

=== Today ===
The composition of the Bundesrat is different from other similar legislative bodies representing states (such as the Russian Federation Council or the U.S. Senate). Bundesrat members are not elected—either by popular vote or by the state parliaments—but are delegated by the respective state government. They do not enjoy a free mandate (for example, most parliamentary privileges in the Bundesrat can be exercised only by a &quot;Land&quot;, not an individual member) and serve only as long as they are representing their state, not for a fixed period of time. Members of the Bundesrat (suffix &quot;MdBR&quot;) do however enjoy the same immunity from prosecution that Members of the German Bundestag have. In addition, Members of the Bundesrat have unlimited access to sessions of the Bundestag (where they have their own benches to the left of the President of the Bundestag) and its committees and can address it at any time. The latter right was most famously used in 2002 by then-Hamburg Senator Ronald Schill, who gave an inflammatory speech that was widely denounced.

Normally, a state delegation consists of the Minister-President (called Governing Mayor in Berlin, President of the Senate in Bremen and First Mayor in Hamburg) and other cabinet ministers (called senators in Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg). State cabinets may appoint as many delegates as the state has votes, and usually do, but may also send a single delegate to exercise all of the state&#x27;s votes. All other ministers/senators are usually appointed as deputy delegates. In any case, the state has to cast its votes &quot;en bloc&quot;, i.e., without vote splitting. If Members of the Bundesrat from the same state vote differently, the entire votes of the state are counted as abstention. A famous example of this was a very close vote in 2002 on a new immigration law by the Schröder government, when Deputy Minister-President of Brandenburg Jörg Schönbohm (CDU) cast a no vote and State Minister Alwin Ziel (SPD) cast a yes vote. As state elections are not coordinated across Germany and can occur at any time, the majority distributions in the Bundesrat can change after any such election. Even without a new state election, it is possible that the state parliament installs a new state government because a new state coalition has formed.

The number of votes a state is allocated is based on a form of degressive proportionality according to its population. This way, smaller states have more votes than a distribution proportional to the population would grant. The presence of the small city-states of Bremen, Hamburg, and Berlin prevents the Bundesrat from having the rural and conservative bias of other similar legislative bodies biased in favor of small states. The allocation of votes is regulated by the German constitution (&quot;Grundgesetz&quot;). All of a state&#x27;s votes are cast &quot;en bloc&quot;—either for, against, in abstention of a proposal. Each state is allocated at least three votes, and a maximum of six. States with more than
* 2 million inhabitants have 4 votes,
* 6 million inhabitants have 5 votes,
* 7 million inhabitants have 6 votes.

By convention, SPD-led &quot;Länder&quot; are summarized as &quot;A-Länder&quot;, while those with governments led by CDU or CSU are called &quot;B-Länder&quot;.
While legislative terms of the Bundestag are numbered, with the 21st Bundestag taking office in 2025, the Bundesrat has none, being a permanent institution with membership changes staggered state by state. Meetings have been numbered in a single sequence since 1949: it had its 1,000th plenary meeting on 12 February 2021.

== Voting ==
In contrast to many other legislative bodies, the delegates to the Bundesrat from any one state are required to cast the votes of the state as a single bloc (since the votes are not those of the respective delegate). The delegates are not independent members of the Bundesrat but instructed representatives of the federated states&#x27; governments. If the members of a delegation cast different votes then the entire vote of the respective state is invalid. This tradition stems from the 1867 Bundesrat. It is a constitutional requirement.

The delegates of a state are equal to each other in the Bundesrat, hence the minister president has no special rights compared to his ministers. But it is possible (and even customary) that one of the delegates (the &quot;Stimmführer&quot;, &quot;leader of the votes&quot;—normally the minister president) casts all votes of the respective state, even if the other members of the delegation are present. In practice if the different parties that form a state government disagree in whether to vote for a proposal, the whole state delegation will abstain.

Between 1949 and 1990, West Berlin was represented by four members, elected by its Senate, but owing to the city&#x27;s ambiguous legal status, they did not have voting rights.

=== Party vetoes for consent laws ===
Because coalition governments are common in the states, states frequently choose to abstain if their coalition cannot agree on a position. Abstaining has the same effect as voting against a proposal, as every Bundesrat decision requires a majority of seats (i.e., 35) in favour, not just a majority of votes cast or a majority of delegates present.

For laws which require explicit Bundesrat consent (, consent laws&quot;)&quot; these abstentions mean that several political parties represented in the Bundesrat possess a &quot;de facto&quot; veto on legislation, as they can block the votes of 35 or more seats.

During the 2021-2024 traffic light coalition, two of the three government parties held such a veto (SPD and Greens, not the FDP), as well as the opposition CDU/CSU, leading to a &quot;de facto&quot; four-way coalition. For the 16 years prior under chancellor Angela Merkel, the Greens held such a veto, and used it to prop up the price of emissions certificates.

Due to the opposition&#x27;s veto threat, the government seeks prior approval of the opposition with veto power. If an agreement fails, the government tends to shelve laws to avoid appearing incapable of acting. This legislative self-restraint of the federal government shows up in empirical analysis of federal legislation.

Consent laws constitute the majority of politically important laws, and one third overall.

== Presidency ==

Originally from 1867 to 1918, the Bundesrat was chaired by the chancellor, although he was not a member and had no vote. This tradition was kept to a degree when since 1919 the Reichsrat still had to be chaired by a member of the imperial government (often the minister of the interior).

Since 1949, the presidency rotates annually among the Minister-Presidents of each of the states. This is fixed by the Königsteiner Abkommen, starting with the federated state with the largest population going down. The President of the Bundesrat convenes and chairs plenary sessions of the body and is formally responsible for representing Germany in matters of the Bundesrat. The president is aided by two Vice Presidents who play an advisory role and deputise in the president&#x27;s absence; the predecessor of the current President is first, his presumptive successor second Vice President. The three together make up the Bundesrat&#x27;s executive committee.

The President of the Bundesrat (&quot;Bundesratspräsident&quot;), is fourth in the order of precedence after the Federal President, the President of the Bundestag, the Chancellor and before the President of the Federal Constitutional Court. The President of the Bundesrat becomes acting Federal President of Germany, in case that the office of the Federal President should be vacant.

==Organizational structure==
Because the Bundesrat is so much smaller than the Bundestag, it does not require the extensive organizational structure of the Bundestag. The Bundesrat typically schedules plenary sessions once a month for the purpose of voting on legislation prepared in committee. In comparison, the Bundestag conducts about fifty plenary sessions a year.

The voting Bundesrat delegates themselves rarely attend committee sessions; instead, they delegate that responsibility to civil servants from their ministries, as allowed for in the Basic Law (art. 52,2). The delegates themselves tend to spend most of their time in their state capitals, rather than in the federal capital. The delegations are supported by the &quot;Landesvertretungen&quot;, which function basically as embassies of the states in the federal capital.

==Criticism==

Some observers claim that the opposing majorities lead to an increase in backroom politics, where small groups of high-tier leaders make all the important decisions and the Bundestag representatives have a choice only between agreeing with them or not getting anything done at all. The German &quot;Federalism Commission&quot; was looking into this issue, among others. There have been frequent suggestions of replacing the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; with a US-style elected Senate, which would be elected at the same date as the &quot;Bundestag&quot;. This is hoped to increase the institution&#x27;s popularity, reduce Land bureaucracy influence on legislation, make opposing majorities less likely, make the legislative process more transparent, and generally set a new standard of democratic, rather than bureaucratic leadership.

Other observers emphasize that different majorities in the two legislative bodies ensure that all legislation, when approved, has the support of a broad political spectrum, a particularly valuable attribute in the aftermath of unification, when consensus on critical policy decisions is vital. The formal representation of the states in the federal government, through the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, provides an obvious forum for the coordination of policy between the states and the federal government. The need for such coordination, particularly given the specific, crucial needs of the eastern states, has become only more important.

Supporters of the Bundesrat claim that the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; serves as a control mechanism on the Bundestag in the sense of a system of checks and balances. Since the executive and legislative functions are closely intertwined in any parliamentary system, the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;s ability to revisit and slow down legislative processes is often seen as making up for that loss of separation.

<doc id="218320" wikidata="Q1399710" url="?curid=218320" title="Ultraviolet catastrophe">
<text>The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century and early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium would emit an unbounded quantity of energy as wavelength decreased into the ultraviolet range. The term &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; was first used in 1911 by Paul Ehrenfest, but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans law. 

The phrase refers to the fact that the empirically derived Rayleigh–Jeans law, which accurately predicted experimental results at large wavelengths, failed to do so for short wavelengths. (See the image for further elaboration.) As the theory diverged from empirical observations when these frequencies reached the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, there was a problem. This problem was later found to be due to a property of quanta as proposed by Max Planck: There could be no fraction of a discrete energy package already carrying minimal energy.

Since the first use of this term, it has also been used for other predictions of a similar nature, as in quantum electrodynamics and such cases as ultraviolet divergence.

== Problem ==
The Rayleigh-Jeans law is an approximation to the spectral radiance of electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength from a black body at a given temperature through classical arguments. For wavelength formula_1, it is:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the spectral radiance, the power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit wavelength; formula_4 is the speed of light; formula_5 is the Boltzmann constant; and formula_6 is the temperature in kelvins. For frequency formula_7, the expression is instead

:formula_8

This formula is obtained from the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics which states that all harmonic oscillator modes (degrees of freedom) of a system at equilibrium have an average energy of formula_9.

The &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; is the expression of the fact that the formula misbehaves at higher frequencies; it predicts infinite energy emission because formula_10 as formula_11.

An example, from Mason&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Sciences&quot;, 
illustrates multi-mode vibration via a piece of string. As a natural vibrator, the string will oscillate with specific modes (the standing waves of a string in harmonic resonance), dependent on the length of the string. In classical physics, a radiator of energy will act as a natural vibrator. Since each mode will have the same energy, most of the energy in a natural vibrator will be in the smaller wavelengths and higher frequencies, where most of the modes are.

According to classical electromagnetism, the number of electromagnetic modes in a 3-dimensional cavity, per unit frequency, is proportional to the square of the frequency. This implies that the radiated power per unit frequency should be proportional to frequency squared. Thus, both the power at a given frequency and the total radiated power is unlimited as higher and higher frequencies are considered: this is unphysical, as the total radiated power of a cavity is not observed to be infinite, a point that was made independently by Einstein, Lord Rayleigh, and Sir James Jeans in 1905.

== Solution ==
In 1900, Max Planck derived the correct form for the intensity spectral distribution function by making some assumptions that were strange for the time. In particular, Planck assumed that electromagnetic radiation can be emitted or absorbed only in discrete packets, called &quot;quanta&quot;, of energy: 
formula_12
where: 
* is the Planck constant,
* is the frequency of light, 
* is the speed of light,
* is the wavelength of light. 
By applying this new energy to the partition function in statistical mechanics, Planck&#x27;s assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral distribution functions:
formula_13
where:
* is the absolute temperature of the body,
* is the Boltzmann constant,
* denotes the exponential function.

In 1905, Albert Einstein solved the problem physically by postulating that Planck&#x27;s quanta were real physical particles – what we now call photons, not just a mathematical fiction. They modified statistical mechanics in the style of Boltzmann to an ensemble of photons. Einstein&#x27;s photon had an energy proportional to its frequency and also explained an unpublished law of Stokes and the photoelectric effect. This published postulate was specifically cited by the Nobel Prize in Physics committee in their decision to award the prize for 1921 to Einstein.

<text>William Bradford ( 19 March 15909 May 1657) was an English Puritan Separatist originally from the West Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. He moved to Leiden in the Dutch Republic in order to escape persecution from King James I of England, and then emigrated to the Plymouth Colony on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact and went on to serve as Governor of the Plymouth Colony intermittently for about 30 years between 1621 and 1657. He served as a commissioner of the United Colonies of New England on multiple occasions and served twice as president. His journal &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; covered the years from 1620 to 1646 in Plymouth.

==Early life==
William Bradford was born to Alice Hanson and William Bradford in Austerfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and was baptized on 19 March 1590. The family possessed a large farm and were considered wealthy and influential. Bradford&#x27;s grandfather was William Bradforthe, who had at least four children, including Bradford&#x27;s father, and was probably of noble ancestry, according to researcher George J. Hill.

Bradford&#x27;s childhood was marked by numerous deaths in the family. He was just over a year old when his father died. His mother remarried when he was four years old, and he was sent to live with his grandfather. His grandfather died two years later, and he returned to live with his mother and stepfather. His mother died a year later, in 1597, and Bradford thus became an orphan at the age of seven and was sent to live with two uncles.

His uncles wanted him to help on the farm, and he later noted in his journal that he suffered at that time from a &quot;long sickness&quot; and was unable to work. He instead turned to reading and became familiar with the Bible and classic works of literature. This is seen by some as a key factor in his intellectual curiosity and his eventual attraction to the Separatist branch of Puritan theology.

==Separatist congregation==
When Bradford was 12 years old, a friend invited him to hear the Rev. Richard Clyfton preach 10 miles away in All Saints&#x27; Church, Babworth in Nottinghamshire. Clyfton believed that the Church of England ought to eliminate all vestiges of Roman Catholic practices, and that this would result in a purer Christian church. Bradford was inspired by his preaching and continued to attend his sermons, even though he was forbidden by his uncles. During one meeting, Bradford met William Brewster, a bailiff and postmaster who lived at Scrooby manor, four miles from Austerfield. During frequent visits, Bradford borrowed books from him, and Brewster regaled him with stories of the efforts toward church reform taking place throughout England.

King James I came to the English throne in 1603, declaring that he would put an end to church reform movements and deal harshly with radical critics of the Church of England. By 1607, secret meetings were being held at Scrooby Manor and about 50 reform-minded individuals began to worship together, led by Richard Clyfton and the Rev. John Robinson. This group decided that reform of the Church of England was hopeless and they would sever all ties. Their weekly meetings eventually attracted the attention of the Archbishop of York, and many members of the congregation were arrested in 1607. Brewster was found guilty of being &quot;disobedient in matters of religion&quot; and was fined. Some members were imprisoned and others were watched &quot;night and day&quot;, according to Bradford, by those loyal to the archbishop. Adding to their concerns, the Scrooby congregation learned that other dissenters in London had been imprisoned and left to starve.

The Scrooby congregation decided in 1607 to leave England unlawfully for the Dutch Republic, where religious freedom was permitted, and Bradford determined to go with them. The group encountered several major setbacks when trying to leave England, most notably their betrayal by an English sea captain who had agreed to carry them to the Netherlands, but instead turned them over to the authorities. Most of the congregation were imprisoned for a short time after this failed attempt, including Bradford. By the summer of 1608, however, they managed to escape England in small groups and relocate to Leiden in the Dutch Republic. Bradford was 18.

===In Leiden and London===

Bradford arrived in Amsterdam in August 1608. He had no family with him and was taken in by the Brewster household. The Scrooby congregation had to work the lowest of jobs and to live in poor conditions, being foreigners and having spent most of their money in attempts to get to the Dutch Republic. After nine months, the group chose to relocate to the smaller city of Leiden.

Bradford continued to reside with the Brewster family in a poor Leiden neighborhood known as Stink Alley. Conditions changed dramatically for him when he turned 21 and was able to claim his family inheritance in 1611. He bought his own house, set up a workshop as a fustian weaver (weaver of heavy cotton cloth for men&#x27;s clothing), and earned a reputable standing. In 1613, he married Dorothy May, the daughter of a well-off English couple living in Amsterdam. They were married in a civil service, as they could find no example of a religious service in the Scriptures. In 1617, they had their first child, named John.

In 1619, William Bradford sold his house in Leiden and appears in March 1620 tax records in London being taxed for personal property at the Duke&#x27;s Place, Aldgate. Aldgate was an area of London known to be the residence of numerous Dutch merchants, as well as many religious dissenters. Some familiar &quot;Mayflower&quot; names of families living in the area included Allerton, Tilley, Sampson, and Hopkins.

One family in Aldgate played an important part in Bradford&#x27;s life in America. Edward and Alice (Carpenter) Southworth and their two sons were residing at Heneage House, the Duke&#x27;s Place, in Aldgate in 1620. Southworth was a highly respected leader of the Leiden group, but he died in 1621/22. His widow Alice emigrated to Plymouth Colony after Bradford&#x27;s wife died, and they were married.

==Founding Plymouth Colony==
===Departure aboard the &quot;Speedwell&quot;===
By 1617, the Scrooby congregation began to plan the establishment of their own colony in the Americas. The Separatists could practice religion as they pleased in the Dutch Republic, but they were troubled by the fact that their children were being influenced by Dutch customs and language, after nearly ten years in the Netherlands. Therefore, they commenced three years of difficult negotiations in England seeking permission to settle in the northern parts of the Colony of Virginia (which then extended north to the Hudson River). The colonists also struggled to negotiate terms with a group of financial backers in London known as the Merchant Adventurers. By July 1620, Robert Cushman and John Carver had made the necessary arrangements, and approximately fifty Separatists departed Delftshaven on board the &quot;Speedwell&quot;.

It was an emotional departure. Many families were split, as some Separatists stayed behind in the Netherlands, planning to make the voyage to the New World after the colony had been established. William and Dorothy Bradford left their three-year-old son John with Dorothy&#x27;s parents in Amsterdam, possibly because he was too frail to make the voyage.

According to the arrangements made by Carver and Cushman, the &quot;Speedwell&quot; was to meet with the &quot;Mayflower&quot; off the coast of England and both were destined for the northern part of the Colony of Virginia. The &quot;Speedwell&quot;, however, proved to be not structurally sound enough to make the voyage, and some of the passengers were transferred aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, making crowded conditions. Joining the Scrooby congregation were about 50 colonists who had been recruited by the Merchant Adventurers for their vocational skills, which would prove useful in establishing a colony. These passengers of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, both Separatist and non-Separatist, are commonly referred to today as &quot;Pilgrims.&quot; The term is derived from a passage in Bradford&#x27;s journal, written years later, describing their departure from the Netherlands (itself an allusion to Hebrews 11:13 in the Bible):

...With mutual embraces and many tears, they took their leaves of one another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them...but they knew they were pilgrims and looked not much on those things, but lifted their eyes to heaven, their dearest country and quieted their spirits...

===The &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage===
The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. The 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by westerly gales, causing the ship&#x27;s timbers to be badly shaken, with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers lying wet and ill, even in their berths. There were two deaths on the trip, a crew member and a passenger.

They spotted Cape Cod hook on 9/19 November 1620, after about a month of delays in England and two months at sea. They spent several days trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, but strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, now called Provincetown Harbor, where they anchored on 11/21 November 1620. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day, Bradford being one of the first to sign.

===Anchored and first explorations at Plymouth Colony===
Bradford had yet to assume any significant leadership role in the colony by the time that he was 30. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; anchored in Provincetown Harbor and he volunteered to be a member of the exploration parties searching for a place for settlement. In November and December, these parties made three separate ventures from the &quot;Mayflower&quot; on foot and by boat, finally locating Plymouth Harbor in mid-December and selecting that site for settlement.

During the first expedition on foot, Bradford got caught in a deer trap made by Indians and hauled nearly upside down. The third exploration departed from the &quot;Mayflower&quot; on 6 December 1620 when a group of men (including Bradford) located Plymouth Bay. A winter storm nearly sank their boat as they approached the bay, but they managed to land on Clark&#x27;s Island, suffering from severe exposure to the cold and waves. During the ensuing days, they explored the bay and found a suitable place for settlement, now the site of downtown Plymouth, Massachusetts. The location featured a prominent hill ideal for a defensive fort. There were numerous brooks providing fresh water, and it had been the location of an Indian village known as Patuxet; therefore, much of the area had already been cleared for planting crops. The Patuxet tribe had been wiped out by plagues between 1616 and 1619, possibly as a result of contact with English fishermen or from contact with the French to the north. Bradford wrote that bones of the dead were clearly evident in many places.

===Loss of first wife===

When the exploring party made their way back on board, he learned of the death of his wife Dorothy. Dorothy (May) Bradford from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, fell overboard off the deck of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; during his absence and drowned. William Bradford recorded her death in his journal. Some historians speculate that she may have died by suicide.

===Great sickness===
The &quot;Mayflower&quot; arrived in Plymouth Bay on 20 December 1620. The settlers began building the colony&#x27;s first house on 25 December (Christmas). Their efforts were slowed, however, when a widespread sickness struck the settlers. The sickness had begun on the ship. On 11 January 1621, Bradford was helping to build houses when he was suddenly struck with great pain in his hipbone and collapsed. He was taken to the &quot;common house&quot; (the only finished house built then) and it was feared that he would not last the night.

Bradford recovered, but many of the other settlers were not so fortunate. During the months of February and March 1621, sometimes two or three people died a day. By the end of the winter, half of the 100 settlers had died. In an attempt to hide their weakness from Native Americans who might be watching them, the settlers buried their dead in unmarked graves on Cole&#x27;s Hill, often at night, and made efforts to conceal the burials.

During the epidemic, there were only a small number of men who remained healthy and bore the responsibility of caring for the sick. One of these was Captain Myles Standish, a soldier who had been hired by the settlers to coordinate the defense of the colony. Standish cared for Bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a bond of friendship between the two men. Bradford was elected governor soon after Carver&#x27;s death and, in that capacity, he worked closely with Standish. Bradford had no military experience and therefore came to rely on and trust the advice of Captain Myles Standish concerning military matters.

===Relationship with Massasoit===

On 16 March, the settlers had their first meeting with the American Indians in the region when Samoset walked into the village of Plymouth as a representative of Massasoit, the sachem of the Pokanokets. This soon led to a visit by Massasoit himself on 22 March, during which he signed a treaty with John Carver, Governor of Plymouth, which declared an alliance between the Pokanokets and Plymouth, requiring them to aid one another militarily in times of need.

Bradford recorded the language of the brief treaty in his journal. He soon became governor and the clause of the treaty that occupied much of his attention as governor pertained to mutual aid. It read, &quot;If any did unjustly war against [Massasoit], we would aid him; if any did war against us, Massasoit should aid us.&quot; This agreement secured the colonists with a faithful ally in New England, though it resulted in tensions between the colonists and Massasoit&#x27;s rivals, such as the Narragansetts and the Massachusetts.

===Governor of Plymouth===

In April 1621, Governor Carver collapsed while working in the fields on a hot day. He died a few days later. The settlers of Plymouth then chose Bradford as the new governor, a position which he retained off and on for the rest of his life. The elected leadership of Plymouth Colony at first consisted of a governor and an assistant governor. The assistant governor for the first three years of the colony&#x27;s history was Isaac Allerton. In 1624, the structure was changed to a governor and five assistants who were referred to as the &quot;court of assistants,&quot; &quot;magistrates,&quot; or the &quot;governor&#x27;s council.&quot; These men advised the governor and had the right to vote on important matters of governance, helping Bradford in guiding the growth of the colony and its improvised government. Assistants during the early years of the colony included Thomas Prence, Stephen Hopkins, John Alden, and John Howland.


==Literary works==

William Bradford&#x27;s most well-known work by far is &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot;. It is a detailed history in journal form about the founding of the Plymouth Colony and the lives of the colonists from 1621 to 1646, a detailed account of his experiences and observations. The first part of the work was written in 1630; toward the end of his life, he updated it to provide &quot;the account of the colony&#x27;s struggles and achievements through the year 1646.&quot; Bradford drew deep parallels between everyday life and the events of the Bible. As Philip Gould writes, &quot;Bradford hoped to demonstrate the workings of divine providence for the edification of future generations.&quot;

In 1888, Charles F. Richardson referred to Bradford as a &quot;forerunner of literature&quot; and &quot;a story-teller of considerable power.&quot; Moses Coit Tyler called him &quot;the father of American history.&quot; Many American authors have cited his work in their writings; for example, Cotton Mather referred to it in &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot; and Thomas Prince referred to it in &quot;A Chronological History of New-England in the Form of Annals.&quot; Even today it is considered a valuable piece of American literature, included in anthologies and studied in literature and history classes. It has been called an American classic and the preeminent work of art in seventeenth-century New England.&quot;

The &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; manuscript disappeared by 1780, &quot;presumably stolen by a British soldier during the British occupation of Boston&quot;; it reappeared in Fulham, London, in the Bishop of London&#x27;s library at Fulham Palace. A long debate ensued as to the rightful home for the manuscript. United States Senator George Frisbie Hoar and others made multiple attempts to have it returned, and the British finally relinquished it to Massachusetts on 26 May 1897.

Bradford&#x27;s journal also contributed to the book &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, which was written in part by Edward Winslow and published in England in 1622. It was intended to inform Europeans about the conditions surrounding the American colonists at the Plymouth Colony. Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot; are a collection of fictional conversations between the old and new generations, between &quot;younge men&quot; and &quot;Ancient men&quot;.

==Family==
William Bradford married:
# Dorothy May in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on 10 December 1613. Their marriage record indicates that she was 16 years old and was from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. The record also notes a Henry May, who may have been her father. William and Dorothy had one son.
#: Her death and memorial: On 17 December 1620, Dorothy fell from the deck of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; into the icy waters of Cape Cod Harbor, where the ship was anchored, and drowned. Her husband was with others on an expedition ashore and only learned of her death on his return to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.
#: She was one of four &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers who died between 14 and 18 December 1620, including Edward Thomson, Jasper More (age 7 years), and James Chilton. William Butten was the first to die in Provincetown Harbor, dying on 16 November. They are all commemorated on two cenotaphs in Provincetown, one at Winthrop Street Cemetery and one at the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Passengers Who Died at Sea Memorial. Their burial places ashore are unknown and may have been unmarked in those very early days after the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landing.
#: The death of these five persons was just a precursor of the deaths to come, consuming about half the &quot;Mayflower&quot; company in that first bitter winter of 1620–1621.
# Alice (Carpenter) Southworth, age about 32, in Plymouth on 14 August 1623. She had arrived on the ship &quot;Anne&quot; some weeks earlier. Alice was the widow of Edward Southworth. She was one of five daughters of Alexander and Priscilla Carpenter of Wrington, co. Somerset in England, all being of Leiden about 1600. Alice brought two sons to the marriage: Constant, born about 1612, and Thomas, born about 1617. Alice and William had three children. She died in Plymouth on 26 March 1670 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth near her husband&#x27;s stone.

<text>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the United States Department of Commerce is a U.S. government agency that provides official macroeconomic and industry statistics, most notably reports about the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States and its jurisdictions. They also provide information about personal income, corporate profits, and government spending in their National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).

The BEA is one of the principal agencies of the U.S. Federal Statistical System. Its stated mission is to &quot;promote a better understanding of the U.S. economy by providing the most timely, relevant, and accurate economic data in an objective and cost-effective manner&quot;.

BEA has about 500 employees and an annual budget of approximately $101 million.

== National accounts ==

BEA&#x27;s national economic statistics (National Economic Accounts) provide a comprehensive view of U.S. production, consumption, investment, exports and imports, and income and saving. These statistics are best known by summary measures such as gross domestic product (GDP), corporate profits, personal income and spending, and personal saving.

The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) provide information about personal income, corporate profits, government spending, fixed assets, and changes in the net worth of the U.S. economy.

The accounts also include other approaches and methods of measuring income and spending, such as the gross domestic income (GDI) and gross national income (GNI).

== Industry accounts ==
The industry economic accounts, presented both in an input-output framework and as annual output by each industry, provide a detailed view of the interrelationships between U.S. producers and users and the contribution to production across industries. These accounts are used extensively by policymakers and businesses to understand industry interactions, productivity trends, and the changing structure of the U.S. economy.

There are quarterly and annual reports for &quot;GDP by Industry Accounts&quot;, designed for analysis of a specific industry&#x27;s contribution to overall economic growth and inflation.

== Regional Economic Accounts ==
The regional economic accounts provide information about the geographic distribution of U.S. economic activity and growth. The estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) by state and state and local area personal income (PI), and the accompanying detail, provide a consistent framework for analyzing and comparing individual state and local area economies.

=== Uses of the regional program estimates ===
* The Federal government uses regional income and product estimates to distribute funds to states:
** BEA Regional Income and Product Account Estimates Used to Distribute $406.8 Billion in Federal Funds 
** FY2016 Federal Funds Distribution Using BEA Regional Income and Product Account Statistics
** Federal Uses of BEA Regional Statistics, FY2016
* Twenty-six states have set constitutional or statutory limits on state government revenues or spending that are tied to BEA state personal income or one of its components 
* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) produces statistics for coastal areas, utilizing BEA regional statistics.
* Academic researchers use the estimates for applied economic research.
* Businesses, trade associations, and labor organizations use the estimates for market research.

=== Regional Program ===
The regional program maintains a partnership with a group of users, its members including State agencies, universities, and Census Primary State Data Centers. Users disseminate regional data and give feedback on our estimates and the presentation of the estimates. Distribution in this way encourages State universities and State agencies to use data that are comparable for all States and counties and consistent with national totals, thus enhancing the uniformity of analytic approaches taken in economic development programs and improving the recipients&#x27; ability to assess local area economic developments and to service their local clientele.

== International accounts ==
The international transactions accounts provide information on trade in goods and services (including the balance of payments and the balance of trade), investment income, and government and private financial flows. In addition, the accounts measure the value of U.S. international assets and liabilities and direct investment by multinational enterprises. BEA&#x27;s data on direct investment— the most detailed data set on the activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) available—are used to assess the role these business enterprises play in the global economy.

== History ==
The history of the BEA traces back to two organizations:
* The Division of Commerce and Navigation founded in 1820 in the Office of the Registrar in the Department of the Treasury. This division was abolished in 1866 and functions transferred to a newly created Bureau of Statistics.
* The Statistical Office founded in 1856 in the Department of State. The Office was redesignated the Bureau of Statistics in 1874 and redesignated the Bureau of Foreign Commerce in 1897.
The Bureau of Statistics in Treasury and the Bureau of Foreign Commerce in State were consolidated into the Bureau of Statistics in the new established Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903. The Bureau of Statistics was merged with the Bureau of Manufacturing in 1912 to become the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce (BFDC). When the Department was split, the BFDC was transferred to the newly established Department of Commerce. The Office of Business Economics (OBE) was established in BFDC in 1945. In 1953, the BFDC was abolished and the OBE was designated a primary organization of the Department. In 1972, the OBE was redesignated the Bureau of Economic Analysis and assigned to the newly established Social and Economic Statistics Administration (SESA) in the Department. The BEA was granted autonomous bureau status in 1975 when the SESA was abolished.

<doc id="218332" wikidata="Q8005827" url="?curid=218332" title="William Bradford (printer, born 1663)">
<text>William Bradford (May 20, 1663 – May 23, 1752) was an early American colonial printer and publisher in British America. Bradford is best known for establishing the first printing press in the Middle colonies of the Thirteen Colonies, founding the first press in Pennsylvania in 1685 and the first press in New York in 1693. Bradford operated continuously printing establishments for sixty-two years, heading a family that would include printers and publishers for 140 years. He was also known for controversies regarding freedom of the press. Starting his printing career in London, Bradford emigrated to America in 1685. He established, with others, the first paper mill to appear in the Thirteen American Colonies.

Throughout his career, Bradford printed and published thousands of titles. In addition to his print shops in the province of Pennsylvania, the province of New York, the province of New Jersey, he also had five different locations in New York City. Printing almanacs, newspapers, books, pamphlets, broadsides, blank forms, paper money, legal documents, colonial laws, and religious material, Bradford was also the public printer for the province of New York and province of New Jersey. 

==Early life==

William Bradford was born on May 20, 1663, to William and Ann Bradford in the village of Barwell in Leicestershire, England. Bradford apprenticed outside the family to learn a trade, as was customary at the time. His trainer was Andrew Sowel (some sources spell Sowle or Sorole), the foremost Quaker printer in London, who printed in the Crooked Billet in Holloway Lane at Shoreditch. Bradford started working for Sowel around 1680 and, by December 3, 1684, he had mastered the trade and was freed from his apprenticeship. Bradford married Sowel&#x27;s eldest daughter, Elizabeth, on April 28, 1685. Sowel arranged for the two to join William Penn in his new colony in North America with a letter of recommendation from George Fox, founder of the Quakers, to become the colonial printer. 

==Career==

William and Elizabeth Bradford arrived in America sometime in November 1685 and settled at a location near where Philadelphia was eventually laid out. Bradford then established Pennsylvania&#x27;s first printing press, likely in the Chester or Burlington area. His first publication was an almanac, &quot;Kalendarium Pennsilvaniense&quot; compiled by Samuel Atkins, &quot;Student in the Mathamaticks and Astrology.&quot; Bradford advertised it as available to purchase &quot;near Philadelphia in Pennsilvania&quot; on December 28, 1685. 

After an incident with his printing press, Bradford was told not to print anything unless it was approved by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly council.

In 1688, he printed &quot;Temple of Wisdom,&quot; the first full-sized book released in the middle colonies.

Bradford was living in Philadelphia by 1689 and had established a bookstore. He published a booklet in 1689 composed by Quaker missionary George Keith titled &quot;The Presbyterian and Independent Visible Churches in New England.&quot; Historian Isaiah Thomas owned a copy of the book that he claimed was the oldest known book printed in Philadelphia. According to book dealer historian William S. Reese, it is one of the first books printed in America. In that year Joseph Growdon, a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly council, hired Bradford to print William Penn&#x27;s original charter for the province. The new Pennsylvania governor John Blackwell was outraged and reprimanded him. Bradford argued that he printed what he received. In reprimanding the publishing of the original charter, authorities attempted to deny the people of Pennsylvania knowledge of the rights and privileges afforded them under their laws.
In 1690, Bradford, partnered with a newly arrived German paper maker, William Rittenhouse, and several merchants, and established the first paper mill in America along a creek in Roxborough, Pennsylvania. He had sent his wife and two infant sons to England and was making preparations to follow, to become the replacement printer for Sowel who had died, with plans to take over his business there. 

It wasn&#x27;t until he had moved to New York later did he have enough business to contract with the managing partners of the paper mill to get preferential terms on products. The mill was the only paper manufacturer in the Thirteen Colonies until 1710. It was followed by hundreds of paper mills constructed in the United States by 1832.

In 1692, Bradford printed thirteen of Keith&#x27;s writings, including &quot;An Appeal from the Twenty-Eight Judges to Spirit of Truth&quot;, which the authorities construed as rebellious against the local government. Bradford was arrested, tried, and jailed for printing without a trade name imprint, a violation of the Licensing of the Press Act 1662. This was America&#x27;s first trial regarding freedom of the press. 

He later printed works without a printer&#x27;s name or place of publication. One of note was the first book in New York City, &quot;New-England Persecution Transmitted to Pennsylvania&quot; authored by Keith and with some words in Hebrew type.

Bradford was the governor&#x27;s only printer in the province of New York for three decades until 1723. He began publishing their first newspaper, the &quot;New-York Gazette&quot; in 1725, which was published weekly.

== Later life and death ==
Bradford remained as publisher of the New-York Gazette, printing it until he retired. In 1727, he took James Parker as an apprentice for an eight-year term. In 1731, Bradford&#x27;s first wife died and afterwards he married a widow named Smith. In 1734, his former apprentice, John Peter Zenger, was brought to court for libel, but Bradford remained out of the case. 

Bradford is interred in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery on Wall Street in Manhattan where his tombstone still stands reading:

==Bradford family printing legacy==
Bradford&#x27;s wife Elizabeth gave birth to their first child, Andrew in 1686, who, along with his wife Cornelia Smith Bradford, were early American printers. Andrew published the first newspaper in colonial Philadelphia. William Jr, the brother of Andrew, was a printer and seaman. Bradford&#x27;s grandson, William Bradford became a well-known printer during the American Revolution for the Continental Congress. The Bradford Family Papers (1620–1906) are deposited at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Bradford established printing and publishing businesses that operated for 140 years from 1685 until 1825. He trained several apprentices that including John Peter Zenger, James Parker, Henry DeForest, and his son Andrew Bradford.

<doc id="218335" wikidata="Q4019943" url="?curid=218335" title="William Bradford (printer, born 1719)">
<text>William Bradford (1719 – September 25, 1791) was a printer, soldier, and leader during the American Revolution from Philadelphia.

== Printer ==
Bradford was born in New York City in 1719, and was the grandson of the printer William Bradford. He was apprenticed to and was later a partner of his uncle Andrew Bradford in Philadelphia. This relationship ended in 1741. 

He visited England that year, returning in 1742 with equipment to open his own printing firm and library.

Bradford was the publisher of &quot;The Pennsylvania Journal&quot;, the first issue of which appeared on December 2, 1742. In later years, each issue had the still-recognized image of the snake chopped into segments with the motto &quot;Unite or Die&quot;. Variations of this logo were also used by Paul Revere, Benjamin Franklin, and others. 

In 1754, he opened the London Coffee House in Philadelphia and began to write marine insurance. As a publisher and writer, he attacked many policies of the British government, and was especially vocal in his opposition to the Stamp Act in 1765.

The first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in 1774, and Bradford was named as the official printer for the Congress. In this role, he printed the formal resolutions, broadsides, and documents such as the Declaration of Rights, that the Congress issued.

== Military career ==
When the American Revolutionary War started, Bradford left his business in his son&#x27;s hands and, despite being middle aged, went into active military service with the Pennsylvania militia. He was made a major, and later promoted to colonel. He saw action at Trenton and Princeton, at Fort Billingsport, and at Fort Mifflin. Because the wound he received at the Battle of Princeton continued to trouble him, when British forces withdrew from Philadelphia he resigned from the militia and returned to the city.

== Later life and death ==
His son Thomas had continued &quot;The Pennsylvania Journal&quot; during his absence. Now they became partners, and over the years expanded their publishing house. After William&#x27;s death on September 25, 1791, Thomas continued their enterprise. A second son, William (sometimes called William, Jr.), joined the Continental Army, became a lawyer and was later Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and U. S. Attorney General. Thomas&#x27;s son Samuel Fisher Bradford continued the family tradition and is noted for the American printing of &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;.

The following obituary of Bradford was published in &quot;The Maryland Herald&quot; on October 11, 1791:

<text>The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) is an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that provides grants and technical assistance to economically distressed communities in order to generate new employment, help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth through a variety of investment programs. EDA works with boards and communities across the country on economic development strategies.

==History==
In 1965, Congress passed the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (PWEDA) (), which authorized the creation of the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to generate jobs, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically troubled areas of the United States. EDA assistance is available to rural and urban areas of the United States experiencing high unemployment, low income, or other severe economic distress.

==Mission and investment priorities==
The EDA&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;lead the federal economic development agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing American regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy.&quot;

The EDA&#x27;s investment policy is designed to establish a foundation for sustainable job growth and the building of durable regional economies throughout the United States. This foundation builds upon two key economic drivers - innovation and regional collaboration. Innovation is the key to global competitiveness, new and better jobs, a resilient economy, and the attainment of national economic goals. Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery because regions are the centers of competition in the new global economy and those that work together to leverage resources and use strengths to overcome weaknesses will fare better than those that do not. EDA encourages its partners around the country to develop initiatives that advance new ideas and creative approaches to address rapidly evolving economic conditions.

EDA&#x27;s investment priorities are:

# Equity: Economic development planning or implementation projects that advance equity across America through investments that directly benefit 1) one or more traditionally underserved populations (PDF), including but not limited to women, Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders or 2) underserved communities within geographies that have been systemically and/or systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic prosperity such as Tribal Lands, Persistent Poverty Counties, and rural areas with demonstrated, historical underservice.
# Recovery &amp; Resilience: Economic development planning or implementation projects that build economic resilience to and long-term recovery from economic shocks, like those experienced by coal and power plant communities, or other communities impacted by the decline of an important industry or a natural disaster, that may benefit from economic diversification-focused resilience.
# Workforce Development: Economic development planning or implementation projects that support workforce education and skills training activities directly connected to the hiring and skills needs of the business community and that result in well-paying, quality jobs 
# Manufacturing: Economic development planning or implementation projects that encourage job creation, business expansion, technology and capital upgrades, and productivity growth in manufacturing, including efforts that contribute to the competitiveness and growth of domestic suppliers or to the domestic production of innovative, high-value products and production technologies.
# Technology-Based Economic Development: Economic development planning or implementation projects that foster regional knowledge ecosystems that support entrepreneurs and startups, including the commercialization of new technologies, that are creating technology-driven businesses and high-skilled, well-paying jobs of the future.
# Environmentally-Sustainable Development: Economic development planning or implementation projects that help address the climate crisis including through the development and implementation of green products, green processes, including green infrastructure, green buildings, and green places including an emphasis on density in the vicinity of the development.
# .Exports &amp; FDI: Economic development planning or implementation projects that enhance or build community assets to support growth in US exports or increased foreign direct investment.

==Role==
The EDA is the only federal government agency solely focused on economic development. EDA works with communities and boards across the country on regional economic development strategies to attract private investment and create jobs in economically distressed areas of the United States.

EDA&#x27;s economic footprint is wide and its tool box is extensive—including technical assistance, post-disaster recovery assistance, trade adjustment support, strategic planning and research and evaluation capacity, thereby allowing the agency to offer the most effective investment to help communities succeed in the global economy.

EDA&#x27;s primary programs and national initiatives are:

* American Rescue Plan (ARPA) Implementation
** Six programs, collectively called Investing in America’s Communities, will equitably invest the $3 billion EDA received from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. The programs aim to assist communities in their efforts to build back better by accelerating the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and building local economies that will be resilient to future economic shocks. EDA is making a Coal Communities Commitment, allocating $300 million of this funding to ensure support for coal communities.
* Assistance to Coal Communities (ACC)
** Through ACC 2018, EDA designates a portion of its EAA funding to support communities and regions that have been negatively impacted by changes in the coal economy.
* Build to Scale (B2S)
** The Build to Scale (B2S) Program builds regional economies through scalable startups and includes three competitions supporting entrepreneurship, acceleration of company growth and increased access to risk capital across regional economies
* Economic Adjustment Assistance
** Assists state and local interests in designing and implementing strategies to adjust or bring about change to an economy. The program focuses on areas that have experienced or are under threat of serious structural damage to the underlying economic base. Under Economic Adjustment, EDA administers its Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Program, which supplies small businesses and entrepreneurs with the gap financing needed to start or expand their business.
* Economic Recovery Corps
** This program is a network of Economic Recovery Corps fellows to add human capital to local organizations focused on improving economic resilience and competitiveness in distressed regions across the country.
* Equity Impact Investments
** Equity Impact Investments provides technical assistance to enable organizations serving underserved populations and communities to participate in economic development planning and projects.
* Local Technical Assistance
** Helps fill the knowledge and information gaps that may prevent leaders in the public and nonprofit sectors in distressed areas from making optimal decisions on local economic development issues.
* Planning
** Supports local organizations (Economic Development Districts, Indian Tribes, and other eligible areas) with short and long-term planning efforts. The Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) Content Guidelines, provides suggestions, tools, and resources for developing comprehensive economic development strategies
* Public Works
** Empowers distressed communities to revitalize, expand, and upgrade their physical infrastructure to attract new industry, encourage business expansion, diversify local economies, and generate or retain long-term, private sector jobs and investment
* Recompete Pilot Program
** This program was recently authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, and funds were first appropriated via the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.  EDA is underway with design and implementation of this program, and encourages interested stakeholders to learn more by reading the programs’ authorization at 15 U.S.C. § 3722b for Recompete and EDA’s Statement On Fiscal Year 2023 Appropriation.
* Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs (Tech Hubs)
** This program was recently authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, and funds were first appropriated via the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.  EDA is underway with design and implementation of this program, and encourages interested stakeholders to learn more by reading the programs’ authorization at 15 U.S.C. § 3722a for Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs and EDA’s Statement On Fiscal Year 2023 Appropriation.
* Research and National Technical Assistance (RNTA)
** The RNTA program funds research, evaluation, and national technical assistance projects that promote competitiveness and innovation in distressed rural and urban regions throughout the United States and its territories.
* Revolving Loan Fund (RLF)
** EDA provides Economic Adjustment Assistance (PDF) grants to eligible recipients to capitalize or recapitalize lending programs that service businesses that cannot otherwise obtain traditional bank financing (and in limited situations to governmental entities for public infrastructure). These loans provide access to capital as gap financing to enable small businesses to grow and generate new employment opportunities with competitive wages and benefits. Financing also helps retain jobs that might otherwise be lost, create wealth, and support minority and women-owned businesses.
* STEM Talent Challenge
** The U.S Economic Development Administration’s STEM Talent Challenge aims to build STEM talent training systems to strengthen regional innovation economies. The FY21 STEM Talent Challenge will award a total of $2 million in grants to organizations that are creating and implementing STEM talent development strategies that complement their region’s innovation economy.
* Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms
** A national network of 11 Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers to help strengthen the competitiveness of American companies that have lost domestic sales and employment because of increased imports of similar goods and services
* University Centers
** A partnership of the federal government and academia that makes the varied and vast resources of universities available to the economic development community.

<text>The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that promotes growth and competitiveness of the United States&#x27; minority-owned businesses, including Hispanic and Latino American, Asian Pacific American, African American, and Native American businesses. 

MBDA&#x27;s stated mission is to promote the growth and competitiveness of minority-owned businesses by providing access to capital, access to contracts and access to market opportunities - both domestic and global. The main feature of the organization and its site is to provide business consulting services to minority business owners.

==History==
On March 5, 1969, President Richard Nixon issued Executive Order 11458, establishing the Office of Minority Business Enterprise. On October 13, 1971, President Nixon issued Executive Order 11625, which clarified MBDA&#x27;s authority and expanded the scope of its operations. In 1979, the agency was renamed the Minority Business Development Agency.

The agency was cut in President Trump&#x27;s FY18 executive budget, but subsequently restored in the President&#x27;s FY19 budget - the only Federal agency to be restored after its proposed elimination.

On November 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which established the Minority Business Development Agency as a permanent agency. Prior to this, the agency was operating solely under Executive Order 11458.

==National Minority Enterprise Development Week==

The Agency holds National Minority Enterprise Development Week in the month of October, observed in the United States to recognize and celebrate the achievements and contributions of the minority business enterprise community.

President Ronald Reagan first recognized National MED Week in 1983. The week is formally celebrated each year by the Minority Business Development Agency, a U.S. government agency housed within the U.S. Department of Commerce.

On October 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation which officially designated October 22 through October 28, 2017 as National Minority Enterprise Development Week.

On October 24, 2017, President Trump recognized minority-owned businesses in the Oval Office during National MED Week, when he welcomed winners of the National MED Week Awards with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and MBDA Acting National Director Christopher A. Garcia.

<text>The West Indies Federation, also known as the West Indies, the Federation of the West Indies or the West Indian Federation, was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation, with its capital in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state – possibly similar to Canada, the Federation of Australia, or the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Before that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably. The formation of a West Indian Federation was encouraged by the United Kingdom, but also requested by pan-Caribbean nationalists.

The territories that would have become part of the Federation eventually became the nine contemporary sovereign states of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago; with Anguilla, Montserrat, the Cayman Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands becoming British overseas territories. British Guiana and British Honduras held observer status within the West Indies Federation.

== History ==
Several historically &quot;West Indian&quot; British colonies opted not to join the Federation for various reasons. The Bahamas and Bermuda believed that their future lay with association with North America, and the British Virgin Islands similarly looked to a possible future association with the United States Virgin Islands. British Honduras was involved in a territorial dispute with Guatemala and saw the West Indies Federation as being too weak to defend British Honduras against its neighbour, instead looking to the UK for potential military assistance against Guatemala. British Guiana opted not to join when the Federation was formed due to its own ongoing political and internal struggles for independence from the UK, which had started in the 1950s. At issue was its newly formed political party with socialist leanings, at the height of the Cold War. It had hoped to join the Federation once these issues were resolved.

British Honduras and British Guiana did participate in the Federation to a certain extent as observers. The Bahamas participated in the 1960 West Indies Federation Games, with a future prime minister of the Bahamas, Perry Christie, as an athlete. Guyana would ultimately express interest in a very loose re-attempted Caribbean Federation around 1971.
The Federation was an internally self-governing, federal state made up of ten provinces, all British colonial possessions. The federation was created by the United Kingdom in 1958 from most of the British West Indies. Britain intended that the Federation would shortly become a fully independent state, thus simultaneously satisfying the demands for independence from all the colonies in the region. However, significant political divisions among the former colonies persisted, and the Federation never achieved full sovereignty.
The legal basis for the federation was the (4 &amp; 5 Eliz. 2. c. 63), and the date of formation – 3 January 1958 – was set by an Order in Council proclaimed in 1957.

=== Prior attempts at federation ===
The Federation of the West Indies was not the first attempt at a British Caribbean federation. The history of the previous attempts at federations and unions, in part, explains the failure of the 1958 Federation.

The initial federal attempts never went so far as to try to encompass all of the British West Indies (BWI), but were more regional in scope. The historical regional groupings included the British Leeward Islands, British Windward Islands and Jamaica with its nearby former dependencies. See: History of the British West Indies.

=== Dissolution ===
Many reasons have been put forward to explain the demise of the federation. These include the lack of local popular support, competing insular nationalism, the weakness of the federal government, prohibitions on federal taxation and freedom of movement, inadequacies in the Federal constitution, fundamental changes made to the constitution very early in its existence, political feuds between the influential leaders, the decision of the three most influential politicians not to contest Federal elections, friction between these leaders and the Federal government, the overwhelming concentration of population and resources in the two largest units, geographic and cultural distance between the units, the lack of a history of common administration, and the impact of the period of self-government that followed the promotion from Crown Colony system.

However, the immediate catalyst for the dissolution of the Federation was Jamaican discontent. By 1961, there were a number of reasons for Jamaica&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the state of affairs:
* Jamaica&#x27;s share of the seats in the federal parliament was smaller than its share of the total population of the Federation.
* It was believed that the smaller islands would be a drain on Jamaica&#x27;s wealth – the financial rewards of the island&#x27;s bauxite were beginning to roll in.
* Jamaica was somewhat isolated in distance from the other islands.
* Inter-island rivalry.
* Many Jamaicans were upset that Kingston had not been chosen as the federal capital.

The most important reason for Jamaican dissatisfaction was the Federation&#x27;s continuing colonial status. Jamaica had joined the Federation because its leaders had believed that the West Indies would quickly be granted independence. Nearly three years after the formation of the Federation, this had not occurred; meanwhile, smaller British colonies, like Cyprus and Sierra Leone, had gained independence. Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island could and should seek independence in its own right.

There were also problems with the Federation&#x27;s proposed capital in Chaguaramas on Trinidad, at that time still in the hands of the United States (having leased it as a naval base from the United Kingdom during World War II). Many of the Caribbean provincial leaders wanted Chaguaramas to be the Federation&#x27;s capital. Provincial leaders, such as Norman Manley of Jamaica and Eric Williams, pushed for handing over of Chaguaramas to the Federation from the US. However the US and the UK disagreed and the Federation&#x27;s Prime Minister Grantley Adams stopped the provincial leaders from obtaining Chaguaramas. For many Jamaicans it appeared that the Federation would then just hamper their development and movement towards independence.

As a result, the Bustamante-led Jamaica Labour Party (the local component of the West Indian DLP) successfully forced Manley to hold a referendum in September 1961 on political secession from the Federation. The result was 54% in favour of leaving the Federation, despite the opposition of Manley, the province&#x27;s Chief Minister at the time. Manley himself lost the subsequent island elections in April 1962, and Bustamante became the first Prime Minister of an independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962.

After Jamaica left, there was an attempt to salvage a new federation from the wreckage of the old. Much depended on Premier Williams of Trinidad and Tobago, who had stated previously that he wanted a &quot;strong federation&quot;. Premier Vere Bird of Antigua responded that his province would only be in a federation with Trinidad as an equal partner, not as &quot;a little Tobago&quot;. He did indicate that a strong federation was acceptable provided that no attempt was made to create a unitary state.

Negotiations on this new federation began in September 1961; however, they indicated that Trinidad would have to provide 75 to 80 percent of the new Federation&#x27;s revenue. Also, even though Trinidad would now represent 60 percent of the new Federation&#x27;s population, the proposals under consideration would give it less than half of the seats in parliament.

By November, Williams indicated that he was now in favour of the idea of a unitary state. Failing that, he resolved to take Trinidad and Tobago into independence. In this, he was buoyed by his re-election as Trinidadian leader on 4 December 1961. Later that December, Premier Errol Barrow of Barbados met with Williams, but failed to persuade him to keep Trinidad in the Federation.

On 14 January 1962, the People&#x27;s National Movement (the Williams-led Trinidad component of the WIFLP) passed a resolution rejecting any further involvement with the Federation. Williams himself stated that &quot;one from ten leaves nought&quot; – in other words, without Jamaica, no Federation was possible. Trinidad and Tobago became independent on 31 August 1962.

Without Trinidad and Jamaica, the remaining &quot;Little Eight&quot; attempted to salvage some form of a West Indian Federation, this time centred on Barbados. However, these negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Without its two largest states, the Federation was doomed to financial insolvency. Barbados now refused to shoulder the financial burden, and Antigua and Grenada began toying with the idea of merging with Jamaica and Trinidad, respectively.

== Geography ==

The Federation spanned all the island groupings in the Caribbean:
* The Lucayan Archipelago:
** Turks and Caicos Islands
* The Greater Antilles:
** Jamaica
** Cayman Islands (Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman)
* The Lesser Antilles:
** Barbados, east of the Windward Islands
** Leeward Islands:
*** Antigua
*** Barbuda
*** Redonda
*** Saint Christopher
*** Nevis
*** Anguilla
*** Montserrat
** Windward Islands:
*** Dominica
*** Saint Lucia
*** Saint Vincent
*** Grenadines
*** Grenada
** Trinidad
** Tobago

At its widest (west to east), from the Cayman Islands to Barbados it spanned some (and across approximately 22 degrees of longitude) and from the Turks and Caicos Islands in the north, to the Icacos Point, Trinidad in the south it extended (and across 12 degrees of latitude). However, most of the area along either of these distances was taken up by open water (with the exception of some of the other islands lying in between). By comparison Great Britain stretches across nearly 10 degrees of latitude and Spain extends across almost 20 degrees of longitude. Even though the West Indies was spread across such a vast area, most of its provinces were mostly contiguous and clustered fairly close together in the Eastern Caribbean, with the obvious exceptions of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos Islands.

Most of the islands have mountainous interiors surrounded by narrow coastal plains. The exceptions were Anguilla, Antigua, Barbados, Barbuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands (which are all fairly flat), and Trinidad (which has a large mountain range in the north and a small central mountain range in the interior of the otherwise flat island). The narrow coastal plains as well as historical trade is the main reason why almost all of the major settlements (cities and towns) of the Federation were located on the coast. Chief towns included Kingston, Port of Spain, Chaguaramas, Bridgetown, Spanish Town, Montego Bay, San Fernando, Mandeville, Castries, Roseau, St. George&#x27;s, Kingstown, St. John&#x27;s, and Basseterre.

The climate in all the islands is tropical, with hot and humid weather, although inland regions in the larger islands have more temperate climates. Regions falling within the rain shadows (southern coasts of Jamaica and Trinidad and eastern coasts of the Lesser Antilles) are relatively drier. There are two seasons annually: the dry season for the first six months of the year, and the rainy season (also known as the hurricane season) in the second half of the year. Many of the islands fall within the Main Development Region for tropical cyclone activity, with the exception of Trinidad (although it occasionally experiences low latitude hurricanes) and thus are at risk from potential wind and flood damage.

Britain classified the Federation as being part of its &quot;Caribbean and North Atlantic Territories&quot; region which was shared alongside other possessions such as Bermuda.

The Federation today is geographically considered to be part of the North American continent as all of its islands are in and around the Caribbean, even though Trinidad is located just offshore from South America and lies on the same continental shelf. &quot;See Transcontinental countries.&quot;

===Provinces===

==Demographics==
The total population of the West Indies Federation was between 3 and 4 million people, with the majority being of black West African descent. Minorities included Indians from the Indian subcontinent (called East Indians), Europeans, Chinese, Arabs, and Caribs. There was also a large population of mixed descent (mainly mulattos, but also Afro-Indian, Euro-Indian and mixed-Chinese). In terms of religion, most of the population was Protestant, with significant numbers of Catholics and some Hindus and Muslims (both almost exclusively from the East Indian population).

The West Indies Federation (or just West Indies) consisted of around 24 main inhabited islands and approximately 220–230 minor offshore islands, islets and cays (some inhabited, some uninhabited). The largest island was Jamaica, located in the far northwest of the Federation. To the southeast lay the second largest island, Trinidad, followed by Barbados (in terms of population), located at the eastern extremity of the Federation.

== Politics ==

As with all British colonies of the period, Queen Elizabeth II was the head of state, and The Crown was vested with the legislative authority for matters concerning executive affairs, defence and the financing of the Federation. Her representative, The 1st Baron Hailes, was given the title of Governor-General, synonymous with a self-governing colony, rather than that of Governor more typical for a British Crown colony system of government. The title may have reflected the federal nature of the state, or indicated the expectations that the Federation would soon become self-governing or independent. The Governor-General also had the full authority of the British Government to veto any laws passed by the Federation.

The Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation was bicameral, consisting of a nominated Senate and a popularly elected House of Representatives. The Senate consisted of nineteen members. These members were appointed by the Governor General, after consulting the respective territorial governments. Two members represented each unit (with only one from Montserrat). The House of Representatives had 45 total elected members – Jamaica had seventeen seats, Trinidad and Tobago ten seats, Barbados five seats, Montserrat one seat, and the remaining islands two seats each.

However the government (executive) would be a Council of State, not a Cabinet. It would be presided over by the Governor-General and consist of the Prime Minister and ten other officials.

The West Indies Federation did not have independent sources of revenue (relying instead on a mandatory levy on the islands), and did not establish any agreements on a customs union, free trade, or free movement.

The politics of the embryonic Federation were wrecked by struggles between the federal government and the provincial governments, and even power sharing between the two largest provinces (Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago) and the smaller provinces.

The West Indies Federation had an unusually weak federal structure. For instance, its provinces were not contained in a single customs union. Thus, each province functioned as a separate economy, complete with tariffs, largely because the smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the large islands&#x27; economies. Also, complete freedom of movement within the Federation was not implemented, as the larger provinces were worried about mass migration from the smaller islands.

Jamaica, the largest member of the West Indies Federation, opposed plans to establish a customs union and to increase the ability of the federal government to levy taxes.

Adom Getachew writes that relations between minority groups, such as the descendants of East Indians (which were a large share of the populations of Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana), and the majority population of Afro-West Indians were a source of tension in the West Indies Federation. For example, Guyana rejected the West Indies Federation in part because it lacked sufficient protections for ethnic minorities.

There were tensions between those who wanted a strong federal state (capable of undertaking major economic development projects and redistribution) and those who wanted a federal structure that gave each member substantial autonomy. Eric Williams was a strong advocate for a strong federal state. Critics in Jamaica were opposed to any redistributive schemes that would primarily lead to Jamaica providing grants to the smaller islands. There were also some concerns about unequal development and its impact on areas with less competitive industries which wanted protectionist measures within the federation.

In addition, the federal government could not take its component states to task. The initial federal budget was quite small, limiting the federal government&#x27;s ability to use its financial largess as a carrot. It was dependent upon grants from the United Kingdom and from its member states. The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were both larger than the federal budget. This led to repeated requests for those states to provide greater financing to the federal government. These requests were not well received, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago together already contributed 85 percent of the federal revenue, in roughly equal portions.

Furthermore, the office of the Prime Minister was a weak one. Unlike other Westminster systems with Prime Ministers, the West Indian Federation&#x27;s PM could not dissolve Parliament.

=== Capital site: Proposed and &quot;de facto&quot; capital ===
Three member states were proposed as hosts for the capital city of the federation: Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Earlier in the federal negotiations the general opinion had been that the capital should be one of the smaller islands so that the capital would be in a neutral position to the larger territories and it would be able to inject some buoyancy into one of the (then) poorer economies. To this end, Grenada was tentatively selected as the member state to host the capital but this was abandoned after protests from some of the parties involved, and at the London Conference the smaller islands were ruled out for consideration. Within Trinidad and Tobago the first proposed site was Chaguaramas, a few miles west of Port of Spain, but the site was part of a United States naval base. In practice, Port of Spain served as the &quot;de facto&quot; federal capital for the duration of the federation&#x27;s existence.

=== Governance ===
The Federation also had a number of units deemed to be common services for the entire federation, these were:
* The Federal Shipping Service
* The Federal Supreme Court
* The University College of the West Indies
* The West Indies Meteorological Service
* West India Regiment

=== Elections ===
In preparation for the first federal elections, two Federation-wide parties were organised as confederations of local political parties. Both were organised by Jamaican politicians: the West Indies Federal Labour Party by Norman Manley, and the Democratic Labour Party by Alexander Bustamante. In broad terms, the WIFLP consisted of the urban-based parties throughout the Federation, while the DLP consisted of the rural-based parties. A small third party, the Federal Democratic Party was founded in November 1957 by a group of Trinidadians, although it did not win any seats.

The platforms for the two major national parties were similar in many respects. Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada (countries with which the islands had strong cultural and economic links); encouraging and expanding tourism; working to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Federation and to obtain loans, financial aid, and technical assistance. Despite these similarities, there were differences. The WIFLP had advocated the encouragement of agriculture while the DLP had promised a climate favourable to both private industry and labour, development of human and economic resources. The WIFLP promised to encourage the Bahamas (in addition to British Guiana and British Honduras) to join the Federation, whereas the DLP did not. The WIFLP also campaigned to establish a central bank for the extension of credit resources and advocated a democratic socialist society and full internal self-government for all the unit territories, whilst avoiding the issues of freedom of movement and a customs union. The DLP said nothing about full internal self-government, attacked socialism, wished to avoid high taxation (via loans and technical aid) and emphasized West Indian unity, freedom of worship and speech, and encouragement of trade unions.

Federal elections were held on 25 March 1958. The WIFLP won the election, winning 26 seats while the DLP carried 19 seats. The bulk of the WIFLP seats came from the smaller islands while the DLP carried the majority in Jamaica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. The DLP won 11 of the Jamaican seats and 6 of the Trinidadian seats. In appointing the Senate, Governor General Lord Hailes realized that only the St Vincent island government was DLP controlled and as a result the Senate was going to be disproportionately pro WIFLP. In a controversial decision, he contacted the opposition DLP groups in Jamaica and Trinidad, and appointed one DLP senator from each of those islands. Thus the Senate consisted of a total of 15 WIFLP members and 4 DLP members.

WIFLP leader Sir Grantley Adams of Barbados became Prime Minister. The selection of Adams as the Prime Minister was indicative of the problems the Federation would face. The expected leader of the WIFLP was Norman Manley, Premier of Jamaica, and the next logical choice was Dr Eric Williams, Premier of Trinidad and Tobago. However, neither had contested the Federal elections, preferring to remain in control of their respective island power bases. This suggested that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Federation as viable. Similarly, Alexander Bustamante, the Jamaican founder of the DLP, also declined to contest the Federal election, leaving the party leadership to the Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan. The absence of the leading Jamaican politicians from any role at the federal level was to undermine the Federation&#x27;s unity.

Other members of the Council of State included:
* Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade and Industry: Carl La Corbiniere (St Lucia)
* Minister of Finance: Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw (St Kitts)
* Minister of Communications and Works: Wilfred Andrew Rose (Trinidad and Tobago)
* Minister of Natural Resources and Agriculture: Frank Ricketts (Jamaica)
* Minister of Labour and Social Affairs: Phyllis Byam Shand Allfrey (Dominica)
* Ministers without Portfolio: Novelle Richards (Antigua), Victor Vaughn (Barbados), Allan Byfield (Jamaica), James Liburd (St Kitts), and James Luc Charles (St Lucia)

== Judiciary ==
=== Federal Supreme Court ===
There was also a Federal Supreme Court consisting of a Chief Justice and three (later five) other Justices. The Federal Supreme Court itself was the successor to the West Indian Court of Appeal (established in 1919) and had jurisdiction over the same territories (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands (including the British Virgin Islands), Trinidad &amp; Tobago and the Windward Islands) in addition to Jamaica and its dependencies, except for British Honduras, as the British Caribbean Federation Act 1956, which empowered the Privy Council to establish it, also repealed the enactment which allowed for appeals from the British Honduras Supreme Court to the Privy Council or the Supreme Court of Jamaica, namely the British Honduras (Court of Appeal) Act 1881. (The arrangement for appeals to the Supreme Court of Jamaica had generally ceased in 1911 anyway.)

Sir Stanley Eugene Gomes, Chief Justice of Trinidad and Tobago, was appointed Chief Justice of the Federation in August 1961.

== Relationship with Canada ==
The Federation maintained a particularly close relationship with Canada, which had a similar past as a federation of several former separate British colonies. In the early years, several Caribbean leaders suggested that the West Indies Federation should investigate the possibility of becoming a Canadian province.

Despite the breakdown in talks, in May 1961, Canada government presented the West Indies Federation with two of the region&#x27;s most important gifts: two merchant ships, named &quot;The Federal Palm&quot; and &quot;The Federal Maple&quot;. These two vessels visited every island in the federation twice monthly, providing a crucial sea-link between the islands.

== Symbols ==
===Music===
During that period, many calypsos made reference to the Federation of the West Indies, first expressing hope, then frustration as the process collapsed.

=== Philatelic collections / postal stamps ===

During the Federation&#x27;s existence, each member continued to issue its own postage stamps as before; but on 22 April 1958, each of the members (except for the Cayman Islands) issued a set of three commemorative stamps. All of these stamps used a common design depicting a map of the Caribbean and a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, with an inscription reading at the top and the name of the member state at the bottom. These stamps are quite common in both mint and used condition.

== Legacy ==
The federation&#x27;s currency was the West Indies dollar (though Jamaica continued to use the pound), which was later succeeded by the East Caribbean dollar, the Barbadian dollar, and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar. Successor organisations included the West Indies Associated States and CARICOM.

The Federal Supreme Court would also be succeed by a British Caribbean Court of Appeal (1962–1966) and then a West Indies Associated States Supreme Court (Court of Appeal and High Court) (1967–1980) and ultimately by an Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal and Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in 1981 for the OECS. More recently a Caribbean Court of Justice has been established which would also fulfil the role of the original Supreme Court if all CSME members accede to the court&#x27;s appellate jurisdiction (currently Barbados, Belize and Guyana do so).

Some see the West Indies cricket team as a legacy of the Federation, although the side was actually organised thirty years prior to the birth of the federation.

Another lasting regional fixture, officially created before the Federation, is the University of the West Indies. During the Federation, the university pursued a policy of regional expansion beyond the main Jamaica campus. Two other campuses were established: one in Trinidad and Tobago, established in 1960, and one in Barbados, established a short time after the Federation dissolved in 1963. Since 2004, the West Indies Federal Archives Centre has been located on the university&#x27;s Cave Hill campus in Barbados.

=== UK/West Indies Associated States (WIAS) ===

The West Indies Federation was legally dissolved with the Parliament of the United Kingdom&#x27;s (10 &amp; 11 Eliz. 2. c. 19). The remaining &quot;Little Eight&quot; provinces once again became separate colonies supervised directly from London, most of which became independent later on, as follows:
* Barbados – 1966
* Grenada – 1974
* Dominica – 1978
* Saint Lucia – 1979
* St Vincent and the Grenadines – 1979
* Antigua and Barbuda – 1981
* Saint Kitts and Nevis – 1983

The Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands had been separated from Jamaica upon the latter&#x27;s independence in 1962; Anguilla was separated from Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1980. Along with Montserrat, all three remain British Overseas Territories.

<doc id="218341" wikidata="Q709229" url="?curid=218341" title="William Bradford (Attorney General)">
<text>William Bradford (September 14, 1755 – August 23, 1795) was a lawyer and judge from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the second United States Attorney General in 1794–1795.

== Early life ==
He was the son of the printer William Bradford and was born in Philadelphia. He began his education at the Academy of Philadelphia, then attended Princeton University, where he formed a lifelong friendship with Virginian James Madison, before graduating in 1772. When he returned to Philadelphia he read law with Edward Shippen. His progress was delayed by the American Revolutionary War.

== Military career ==
In 1776, when the Pennsylvania militia was called out, William volunteered as a private. Later that year, the militia was organized into a &quot;flying camp&quot; with Daniel Roberdeau as the first brigadier general in the states forces. General Roberdeau chose the young man as an aide, and later promoted him to brigade major on his headquarters staff.

When his militia term expired, he joined the Continental Army as a captain and company commander in the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment commanded by Richard Hampton. By the end of the year, he saw action in the Battle of Trenton. While at Morristown, New Jersey, he was named a deputy to the muster master-general on April 10, 1777, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the encampment at Valley Forge in late 1777 and early 1778, his headquarters was at the David Havard House. He resigned after two years due to ill health and returned home in early 1779.

== Legal career ==
Bradford joined the bar before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in September 1779. He was named as the state&#x27;s Attorney General in 1780, and served until 1791. In 1784, he married Susan Vergereau Boudinot, the only daughter of Elias Boudinot. The following year, 1785, Bradford was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. On August 2, 1791 Bradford represented General William West and argued the first recorded case before the U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;West v. Barnes&quot; losing the decision. 

=== Supreme Court Justice ===
On August 22, 1791, Bradford was appointed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and served for three years. In 1793, Governor Thomas Mifflin asked his help to reduce the use of the death penalty. His report to the legislature was in the form of an essay, &quot;An Inquiry how far the Punishment of Death is Necessary in Pennsylvania&quot;. In the next reorganization of Pennsylvania&#x27;s penal code, the use of capital punishment was substantially reduced. Other states followed the Pennsylvania example.

=== Attorney General ===
On January 8, 1794, George Washington named him Attorney General for the United States to replace Edmund Randolph. 

== Death and legacy ==
He died while in office as US Attorney General in 1795. He was buried with his wife&#x27;s family in Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard in Burlington, New Jersey. A cenotaph for Bradford was built at his family&#x27;s burial plot in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.
Bradford County, Pennsylvania, was named in his honor.

<doc id="218360" wikidata="Q6978888" url="?curid=218360" title="National Telecommunications and Information Administration">
<text>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is a bureau of the United States Department of Commerce that serves as the president&#x27;s principal adviser on telecommunications policies pertaining to the United States&#x27; economic and technological advancement and to regulation of the telecommunications industry.

== Agency goals ==
Among its stated goals are:

* Working to ensure that all Americans have affordable phone and cable TV service.
* Helping to bring the benefits of advanced telecommunications technologies to millions of Americans in rural and underserved urban areas through its information infrastructure grants.
* Providing the hardware that enables public radio and television broadcasters to extend and maintain the reach of their programming.
* Advocating competition and liberalization of telecommunications policies around the world.
* Participating in international government-to-government negotiations to open markets for U.S. companies.
* Negotiating with foreign governments to ensure adequate spectrum for national defense, public safety, and U.S. business needs.
* Promoting efficient use of federal radio spectrum and encouraging the development and implementation of new and emerging telecommunications technologies.
* Performing long-term research to explore uses of higher frequency spectrum.
* Working with Federal, state, and local public safety agencies to address future spectrum requirements.
== Main offices ==

===Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD)===
The Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) is the domestic policy division of the NTIA. OPAD is responsible for executing and managing research and analysis and preparing policy recommendations for the Executive Branch. The domestic policy office is responsible for creating policies that promote innovation and growth, both politically and economically, that provide for American businesses and consumers, alike.

These policies affect how Americans use and gain access to the wireless services like the Internet, telephone service and video programming. Issues the OPAD deals with include making sure all Americans have access to integrated broadband services, content is regulated to keep children safe on the Internet, competition in the telecommunication and information industries are cooperative and that user privacy is protected.

Additionally, OPAD carries out research, files reports, letters and formal comments, and proposes and responds to federal legislation for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other regulatory committees.

===Office of International Affairs (OIA)===
The Office of International Affairs (OIA) is responsible for developing and the implementation of policies to strengthen U.S. companies&#x27; ability to compete worldwide in both the Information Technology and Communications sectors. In consultation with other U.S. agencies and the U.S. private sector, OIA partakes in both international and regional conferences and conventions to advocate for policies that open information and communication technology (ICT) markets and boost competition.

The two main goals of the OIA are to:
# Formulate international ICT policy, goals, and strategies:
#* By leveraging the knowledge of the Office of Spectrum Management, Office of Policy Analysis and Development, Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications, and the Institute for Telecommunications Sciences, the OIA can provide important policy and technical breakdowns to the U.S. negotiators and interagency consignments.
#* The OIA also provides long-lasting advice to the Executive Branch contemplating the management of the Internet&#x27;s domain name and numbering system (DNS), which is critical to the overall infrastructure.
# Advocate U.S. policy interests
#* The goal of the OIA here is to foster &quot;pro-competitive&quot; and &quot;flexible policy environments&quot; that:
#:* Carry the profits of ICTs to the global community
#:* Open up foreign market opportunities for U.S. Telecommunications and Information Technology companies
#:* Observe the esteemed role of all stakeholders in the production and facilitation of the Internet as well as telecommunications policy issues occurring in the ICT community

The OIA staff helps to participate in U.S. delegations of many different meetings in which global telecommunications and information policy is discussed and developed by providing the negotiators critical policy and expertise advice.

===Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS)===

The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) is the research and engineering laboratory of the NTIA. ITS provides technical support to NTIA by further advancing telecommunications and information infrastructure development, strengthening domestic competition, enhancing U.S. telecommunications trade deals, as well as promoting a more effective use of the radio spectrum. Additionally, ITS serves as a key federal appliance in investigating the current telecommunications’ challenges of other federal agencies, state and local governments, private corporations and associations, and international organizations.

===Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA)===
The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) collaborates public and non-profit entities in productively using telecommunications and information technologies to complete national goals in addition to adequately providing public services. The OTIA is also currently administering programs that are helping people switch to digital television, the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP), and Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) Grant Program.

Additionally, the OTIA is involved with the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP), a competitive grant program that assists public broadcasting stations, state and local governments, Indian tribes, and non-profit organizations construct facilities to bring educational and cultural programs to the American public using telecommunication broadcast technologies. Funds are allocated to support the Pan-Pacific Educational and Cultural Experiments by Satellite (PEACESAT) project, which provides satellite-delivered education, medical, and environmental emergency telecommunications to numerous small-island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean area.

The OTIA is also involved with the New York City 9/11 Program and the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP). The NYC 9/11 Program provided the Metropolitan Television Alliance (MTVA) with $29.5 million for the creation and classification costs of the temporary digital television broadcast system in the NYC area until a more permanent facility is finished atop the Freedom Tower. The TOP program, which was last awarded grants in 2004, plays a significant role in understanding the vision of an information society by providing logical applications of innovative telecommunications and information technologies in both the public and non-profit sectors.

===Office of Spectrum Management (OSM)===

The NTIA&#x27;s Office of Spectrum Management is in charge of regulating use of spectrum allocated to the federal government. It serves in a manner equivalent to the Federal Communications Commission for this purpose.

The OSM carries out the responsibilities of managing the radio frequency spectrum by:
* Establishing and issuing policy overlooking allocations and administrations governing the Federal spectrum use
* Assigning plans for both peacetime and wartime use of the spectrum
* Preparing for, participating in, and establishing the results of international radio conferences
* Maintaining spectrum use databases
* Participating in all aspects of the federal government’s communications regarding emergency readiness activities and automated information security systems

The &quot;NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management&quot;, also known as the &quot;&quot;Red Book&quot;,&quot; is a publication of the OSM, and is the official source for all technical regulations relating to the use of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. The NTIA is the regulating agency for all Federal spectrum use.

== Broadband USA ==
In February 2009, the United States Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including a $7.2 billion grant to the NTIA and U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Rural Utilities Service to bolster broadband access across the United States. Of the grant, $4.7 billion was allocated to provide for the implementation of broadband infrastructure, develop and amplify public computer centers, encourage reasonable adoption of broadband service, and create and sustain a nationwide map of broadband proficiency and availability.

This project, known as the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program is being administered by the NTIA in three levels. The secondary purpose of this project is to reduce the digital gap between the various generation demographics.

Comprehensive Community Infrastructure is the first of three projects in the BTOP. It aims to develop and unfold new or improved broadband internet facilities as well as to network with schools, libraries, hospitals, public safety facilities and other community anchor institutions.

The BTOP will also focus on Public Computer centers and will create new public computer facilities or enhance existing facilities that already offer broadband services to the general public or specific vulnerable populations.

The third project that the BTOP plans to address is Sustainable Broadband Adoption. This project will center in on increasing broadband internet usage, specifically in areas where broadband technology has been unavailable or underutilized. This includes digital literacy training and outreach campaigns to educate the general public on the importance and relevance of broadband in everyday life.

In 2009, the NTIA also launched the State Broadband Data and Development Program to carry out the missions of both the Recovery Act and the Broadband Data Improvement Act to establish an encompassing project that sustains the integration of broadband technology into the economy.

Since the program commenced, NTIA allocated $293 million to 56 grantees, which include one from each state, five territories and the District of Columbia. Grantees are responsible for funding the creation, expansion and maintenance, as well as supporting and encouraging the use of, broadband technology. These efforts are made to aid small businesses and community institutions in the efficient and effective use of technology as well as to conduct research as to the boundaries in broadband expansion and innovation of broadband technology in the future.

== National Broadband Map ==

These programs collected data used by the NTIA to refurbish a public interactive National Broadband Map that was released in February 2011. The map was authorized by Congress with the 2008 Broadband Data Improvement Act and was funded through the 2009 economic stimulus bill. The map will continue to be updated every six months with help from grantees and the general public.

The National Broadband Map is the foundation for efforts to expand and improve broadband internet access around the United States in under-equipped communities as well as assisting businesses and consumers to educate them on broadband internet options. The NTIA&#x27;s findings show that while strides were made in broadband development and implementation, many people and institutions lack the broadband availability and capability needed for full internet engagement. In the last year, broadband access in households has increased nearly five percent and the number of people not using the internet is down over three percent. Yet, lower demographic groups continue to lack behind in internet capability.

The NTIA also found that many community anchor institutions are generally underserved in broadband connectivity. The data showed that two-thirds of the surveyed schools were signed up for broadband service that provide less than half the speed that educational technology studies recommend and only four percent of libraries subscribe to recommended broadband speeds.

Along with the continuous update of the National Broadband Map, the NTIA will sustain its state-driven efforts to increase broadband implementation and will move to expand its collaboration efforts to serve as an expansive network to empower broadband developers.

==2020 data breach==
In 2020, the NTIA suffered a data breach following a cyberattack likely conducted by a nation state adversary, possibly Russia.

<doc id="218361" wikidata="Q25450" url="?curid=218361" title="Northern pintail">
<text>The pintail or northern pintail (Anas acuta) is a duck species with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe and across the Palearctic and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton&#x27;s pintail is considered to be a separate species.

This is a large duck, and the male&#x27;s long central tail feathers give rise to the species&#x27; English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen&#x27;s plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.

The northern pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck&#x27;s population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, owing to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Anas acuta&quot;. The scientific name comes from two Latin words: , meaning &quot;duck&quot;, and &#x27;, which comes from the verb &#x27;, &quot;to sharpen&quot;; the species term like the English name, refers to the pointed tail of the male in breeding plumage. Within the large dabbling duck genus &quot;Anas&quot;, the northern pintail&#x27;s closest relatives are other pintails, such as the yellow-billed pintail (&quot;A. georgica&quot;) and Eaton&#x27;s pintail (&quot;A. eatoni&quot;). The pintails are sometimes separated in the genus &quot;Dafila&quot; (described by Stephens, 1824), an arrangement supported by morphological, molecular and behavioural data. The famous British ornithologist Sir Peter Scott gave this name to his daughter, the artist Dafila Scott.

Eaton&#x27;s pintail has two subspecies, &quot;A. e. eatoni&quot; (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and &quot;A. e. drygalskyi&quot; (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was formerly considered conspecific with the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male&#x27;s breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton&#x27;s pintail is treated as a separate species.

A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram&#x27;s pintail, &quot;A. a. modesta&quot;, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form. The three syntype specimens of &quot;Dafila modesta&quot; Tristram (Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1886, p.79. pl. VII), the extinct subspecies, are held in the vertebrate zoology collections of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession numbers NML-VZ T11792 (male immature), NML-VZ T11795 (female adult) and NML-VZ T11797 (female adult). The specimens were collected by J. V. Arundel in Sydney Island (Manra Island), Phoenix Islands in 1885 and came to the Liverpool national collection via Canon Henry Baker Tristram&#x27;s collection which was purchased in 1896.

==Description==
The northern pintail is a fairly large duck with a wing chord of and wingspan of . The male is in length and weighs , and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is long and weighs . The northern pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly widespread mallard, but is more slender, elongated and gracile, with a relatively longer neck and (in males) a longer tail. The unmistakable breeding plumaged male has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail, which has the central feathers elongated to as much as . The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.

The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male&#x27;s; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.

The pintail walks well on land, and swims well. In water, the swimming posture is forward leaning, with the base of the neck almost flush with the water. It has a very fast flight, with its wings slightly swept-back, rather than straight out from the body like other ducks. In flight, the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front, whereas the female&#x27;s speculum is dark brown bordered with white, narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear, being visible at a distance of .

The male&#x27;s call is a soft &quot;&quot; whistle, similar to that of the common teal, whereas the female has a mallard-like descending quack, and a low croak when flushed.

==Distribution and habitat==
This dabbling duck breeds across northern areas of the Palearctic south to about Poland and Mongolia, and in Canada, Alaska and the Midwestern United States. It mainly winters south of its breeding range, reaching almost to the equator in Panama, northern sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South Asia. Small numbers migrate to Pacific islands, particularly Hawaii, where a few hundred birds winter on the main islands in shallow wetlands and flooded agricultural habitats. Transoceanic journeys also occur: a bird that was caught and ringed in Labrador, Canada, was shot by a hunter in England nine days later, and Japanese-ringed birds have been recovered from six US states east to Utah and Mississippi. In parts of the range, such as Great Britain and the northwestern United States, the pintail may be present all year.

The northern pintail&#x27;s breeding habitat is open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise a wider range of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there is a group of males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.

Among the earliest species to breed in the spring, northern pintails typically form pairs during migration, or even while still on wintering grounds. Breeding takes place between April and June, with the nest being constructed on the ground and hidden amongst vegetation in a dry location, often some distance from water. It is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with plant material and down. The female lays seven to nine cream-coloured eggs at the rate of one per day; the eggs are in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. If predators destroy the first clutch, the female can produce a replacement clutch as late as the end of July.
The hen alone incubates the eggs for 22 to 24 days before they hatch. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has completed moulting.

Around three-quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce. The maximum recorded age is 27 years and 5 months for a Dutch bird.

===Feeding===
The pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night, and therefore spends much of the day resting. Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to deep, which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the mallard.

The winter diet is mainly plant material including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants, but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other &quot;Anas&quot; ducks. During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly invertebrate animals, including aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans.

==Health==
Pintail nests and chicks are vulnerable to predation by mammals, such as foxes and badgers, and birds like gulls, crows and magpies. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large carnivores such as bobcats. Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the gyrfalcon, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.

It is susceptible to a range of parasites including &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, &quot;Giardia&quot;, tapeworms, blood parasites and external feather lice, and is also affected by other avian diseases. It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from avian botulism and avian cholera, and can also contract avian influenza, the H5N1 strain of which is highly pathogenic and occasionally infects humans.

The northern pintail is a popular species for game shooting because of its speed, agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world&#x27;s most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.

This species&#x27; preferred habitat of shallow water is naturally susceptible to problems such as drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck&#x27;s habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed that more than half of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.

Hunting with lead shot, along with the use of lead sinkers in angling, has been identified as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.

==Status==
The northern pintail has a large range, estimated at , and a population estimated at 4.8–4.9 million individuals. The IUCN has categorised the northern pintail as not being threatened globally, however it is endangered in Europe.

In the Palaearctic, breeding populations are declining in much of the range, including its stronghold in Russia. In other regions, populations are stable or fluctuating.

Pintails in North America have been badly affected by avian diseases, though it is unclear if this issue extends to other regions. Specifically, the breeding population fell from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5 million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.

The northern pintail is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies, but it has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.

<text>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that serves as the national patent office and trademark registration authority for the United States. The USPTO&#x27;s headquarters are in Alexandria, Virginia, after a 2005 move from the Crystal City area of neighboring Arlington, Virginia.

The USPTO is &quot;unique among federal agencies because it operates solely on fees collected by its users, and not on taxpayer dollars&quot;. Its &quot;operating structure is like a business in that it receives requests for services—applications for patents and trademark registrations—and charges fees projected to cover the cost of performing the services [it] provide[s]&quot;.

The office is headed by the under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. , Coke Morgan Stewart is acting undersecretary and director, having been appointed to the position by President Trump on January 20.

The USPTO cooperates with the European Patent Office (EPO) and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) as one of the Trilateral Patent Offices. The USPTO is also a Receiving Office, an International Searching Authority and an International Preliminary Examination Authority for international patent applications filed in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

The USPTO maintains a permanent, interdisciplinary historical record of all U.S. patent applications in order to fulfill objectives outlined in the United States Constitution. The PTO&#x27;s mission is to promote &quot;industrial and technological progress in the United States and strengthen the national economy&quot; by:
* Administering the laws relating to patents and trademarks;
* Advising the secretary of commerce, the president of the United States, and the administration on patent, trademark, and copyright protection; and
* Providing advice on the trade-related aspects of intellectual property.

==Structure==
The USPTO is headquartered at the Alexandria Campus, consisting of 11 buildings in a city-like development surrounded by ground floor retail and high rise residential buildings between the Metro stations of King Street station (the main search building is two blocks due south of the King Street station) and Eisenhower Avenue station where the actual Alexandria Campus is located between Duke Street (on the North) to Eisenhower Avenue (on the South), and between John Carlyle Street (on the East) to Elizabeth Lane (on the West) in Alexandria, Virginia. An additional building in Arlington, Virginia, was opened in 2009.

The USPTO was expected by 2014 to open its first ever satellite offices in Detroit, Dallas, Denver, and Silicon Valley to reduce backlog and reflect regional industrial strengths. The first satellite office opened in Detroit on July 13, 2012. In 2013, due to the budget sequestration, the satellite office for Silicon Valley, which is home to one of the nation&#x27;s top patent-producing cities, was put on hold. However, renovation and infrastructure updates continued after the sequestration, and the Silicon Valley location opened in the San Jose City Hall in 2015.

, the end of the U.S. government&#x27;s fiscal year, the PTO had 9,716 employees, nearly all of whom are based at its five-building headquarters complex in Alexandria. Of those, 6,242 were patent examiners (almost all of whom were assigned to examine utility patents; only 99 were assigned to examine design patents) and 388 were trademark examining attorneys; the rest are support staff. While the agency has noticeably grown in recent years, the rate of growth was far slower in fiscal 2009 than in the recent past; this is borne out by data from fiscal 2005 to the present: As of the end of FY 2018, the USPTO was composed of 12,579 federal employees, including 8,185 patent examiners, 579 trademark examiners, and 3,815 other staff.

Patent examiners make up the bulk of the employees at USPTO. They hold degrees in various scientific disciplines, but do not necessarily hold law degrees. Unlike patent examiners, trademark examiners must be licensed attorneys.

All examiners work under a strict, &quot;count&quot;-based production system. For every application, &quot;counts&quot; are earned by composing, filing, and mailing a first office action on the merits, and upon disposal of an application.

Prior to 2012, decisions of patent examiners could be appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, an administrative law body of the USPTO. Decisions of the BPAI could further be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or a civil suit could be brought against the Commissioner of Patents in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The United States Supreme Court may ultimately decide on a patent case. Under the America Invents Act, the BPAI was converted to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or &quot;PTAB&quot;. Similarly, decisions of trademark examiners could be appealed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, with subsequent appeals directed to the Federal Circuit, or a civil action may also be brought.

===Management===
In October 2021, President Joe Biden nominated attorney Kathi Vidal to serve as the USPTO director. She was sworn in on April 13, 2022. On December 16, 2022, Kathi Vidal announced that Vaishali Udupa, an intellectual property attorney, engineer, and currently a top executive from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), will join the 13,000-person Department of Commerce agency as the new commissioner for patents effective January 17, 2023.

==Fee diversion==
For many years, Congress has &quot;diverted&quot; about 10% of the fees that the USPTO collected into the general treasury of the United States. In effect, this took money collected from the patent system to use for the general budget. This fee diversion has been generally opposed by patent practitioners (e.g., patent attorneys and patent agents), inventors, the USPTO, as well as former federal judge Paul R. Michel. These stakeholders would rather use the funds to improve the patent office and patent system, such as by implementing the USPTO&#x27;s 21st Century Strategic Plan. The last six annual budgets of the George W. Bush administration did not propose to divert any USPTO fees, and the first budget of the Barack Obama administration continued this practice, as well as the second budget of the Trump administration; however, stakeholders continue to press for a permanent end to fee diversion.

The discussion of which party can appropriate the fees is more than a financial question. Patent fees represent a policy lever that influences both the number of applications submitted to the office as well as their quality.

==Patents==
* On July 31, 1790, the first U.S. patent was issued to Samuel Hopkins for an improvement &quot;in the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process&quot;. This patent was signed by then-President George Washington.
* The X-Patents (the first 9,957 (approximately), issued between 1790 and 1836) were destroyed by a fire; fewer than 3,000 of those have been recovered and re-issued with numbers that include an &quot;X&quot;. The X generally appears at the end of the numbers hand-written on full-page patent images; however, in patent collections and for search purposes, the X is considered to be the patent type – analogous to the &quot;D&quot; of design patents – and appears at the beginning of the number. The X distinguishes the patents from those issued after the fire, which began again with patent number 1.
* Each year, the PTO issues over 150,000 patents to companies and individuals worldwide. , the PTO had granted 8,743,423 patents and received 16,020,302 applications.
* On June 19, 2018, the 10 millionth U.S. patent was issued to Joseph Marron for invention of a &quot;Coherent LADAR [System] Using Intra-Pixel Quadrature Detection&quot; to improve laser detection and ranging (LADAR). The patent was the first to receive the newly redesigned patent cover. It was signed by then-President Donald Trump during a special ceremony at the Oval Office.
* In February 2024, the USPTO issued a new guideline relating to obtaining a patent as per earlier recommendation by Biden&#x27;s administration. The guideline states that; to obtain a patent, a real person, not AI, must have made a “significant contribution” to the invention and that only a human being can be named as an inventor on a patent.

==Trademarks==
The USPTO examines applications for trademark registration, which can be filed under five different filing bases: use in commerce, intent to use, foreign application, foreign registration, or international registration. If approved, the trademarks are registered on either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register, depending upon whether the mark meets the appropriate distinctiveness criteria. This federal system governs goods and services distributed via interstate commerce, and operates alongside state level trademark registration systems.

Trademark applications have grown substantially in recent years, jumping from 296,490 new applications in 2000, to 345,000 new applications in 2014, to 458,103 new applications in 2018. Recent growth has been driven partially by growing numbers of trademark applications originating in China; trademark applications from China have grown more than 12-fold since 2013, and in 2017, one in every nine trademark applications reviewed by the U.S. Trademark Office originated in China.

Since 2008, the Trademark Office has hosted a National Trademark Expo every two years, billing it as &quot;a free, family-friendly event designed to educate the public about trademarks and their importance in the global marketplace.&quot; The Expo features celebrity speakers such as Anson Williams (of the television show &quot;Happy Days&quot;) and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and has numerous trademark-holding companies as exhibitors. Before the 2009 National Trademark Expo, the Trademark Office designed and launched a kid-friendly trademark mascot known as T. Markey, who appears as an anthropomorphized registered trademark symbol. T. Markey is featured prominently on the Kids section of the USPTO website, alongside fellow IP mascots Ms. Pat Pending (with her robot cat GeaRS) and Mark Trademan.

In 2020, trademark applications marked the sharpest declines and inclines in American history. During the spring, COVID-19 lockdowns led to reduced filings, which then increased in July 2020 to exceed the previous year. August 2020 was subsequently the highest month of trademark filings in the history of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

==Representation==
The USPTO only allows certain qualified persons to practice before the USPTO. &quot;Practice&quot; includes filing of patent and trademark applications on behalf of individuals and companies, prosecuting the patent and trademark applications, and participating in administrative appeals and other proceedings before the PTO examiners, examining attorneys and boards. The USPTO sets its own standards for who may practice. Any person who practices patent law before the USPTO must become a registered patent attorney or agent. A patent agent is a person who has passed the USPTO registration examination (the &quot;patent bar&quot;) but has not passed any state bar exam to become a licensed attorney; a patent attorney is a person who has passed both a state bar and the patent bar and is in good standing as an attorney. A patent agent can only act in a representative capacity in patent matters presented to the USPTO, and may not represent a patent holder or applicant in a court of law. To be eligible for taking the patent bar exam, a candidate must possess a degree in &quot;engineering or physical science or the equivalent of such a degree&quot;. Any person who practices trademark law before the USPTO must be an active member in good standing of the highest court of any state.

The United States allows any citizen from any country to sit for the patent bar (if he/she has the requisite technical background). Only Canada has a reciprocity agreement with the United States that confers upon a patent agent similar rights.

An unrepresented inventor may file a patent application and prosecute it on his or her own behalf (&quot;pro se&quot;). If it appears to a patent examiner that an inventor filing a &quot;pro se&quot; application is not familiar with the proper procedures of the Patent Office, the examiner may suggest that the filing party obtain representation by a registered patent attorney or patent agent. The patent examiner cannot recommend a specific attorney or agent, but the Patent Office does post a list of those who are registered.

While the inventor of a relatively simple-to-describe invention may well be able to produce an adequate specification and detailed drawings, there remains language complexity in what is claimed, either in the particular claim language of a utility application, or in the manner in which drawings are presented in a design application. There is also skill required when searching for prior art that is used to support the application and to prevent applying for a patent for something that may be unpatentable. A patent examiner will make special efforts to help &quot;pro se&quot; inventors understand the process but the failure to adequately understand or respond to an office action from the USPTO can endanger the inventor&#x27;s rights, and may lead to abandonment of the application.

==Electronic filing system==
The USPTO accepts patent applications filed in electronic form. Inventors or their patent agents/attorneys can file applications as Adobe PDF documents. Filing fees can be paid by credit card or by a USPTO &quot;deposit account&quot;.

==Patent search tools==

The USPTO web site provides free electronic copies of issued patents and patent applications as multiple-page TIFF (graphic) documents. The site also provides Boolean search and analysis tools.

The USPTO&#x27;s free distribution service only distributes the patent documents as a set of TIFF files. Numerous free and commercial services provide patent documents in other formats, such as Adobe PDF and CPC.

== Criticisms ==

The USPTO has been criticized for granting patents for impossible or absurd, already known, or arguably obvious inventions. Economists have documented that, although the USPTO makes mistakes when granting patents, these mistakes might be less prominent than some might believe.

===Controversial patents===

*, &quot;Method of exercising a cat&quot;, covers having a cat chase the beam from a laser pointer. The patent has been criticized as being obvious.
*, &quot;Sealed crustless sandwich&quot;, issued in 1999, covers the design of a sandwich with crimped edges. All claims of the patent were canceled by the PTO upon reexamination.
*, &quot;Hyper-light-speed antenna&quot;, an antenna that sends signals faster than the speed of light. According to the description in the patent, &quot;The present invention takes a transmission of energy, and instead of sending it through normal time and space, it pokes a small hole into another dimension, thus, sending the energy through a place which allows transmission of energy to exceed the speed of light.&quot;
*, &quot;Method of swinging on a swing&quot;, issued April 9, 2002, was granted to a seven-year-old boy, whose father, a patent attorney, wanted to demonstrate how the patent system worked to his son who was five years old at the time of the application. The PTO initially rejected it due to prior art, but eventually issued the patent. Upon reexamination all claims of the patent were canceled by the PTO.
*, &quot;Space vehicle propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state&quot;, describes an anti-gravity device. In November 2005, the USPTO was criticized by physicists for granting it. The journal &quot;Nature&quot; first highlighted this patent issued for a device that presumably amounts to a perpetual motion machine, defying the laws of physics. The device comprises a particular electrically superconducting shield and electromagnetic generating device. The examiner allowed the claims because the design of the shield and device was novel and not obvious. In situations such as this where a substantial question of patentability is raised after a patent is issued, the Commissioner of the Patent Office can order a reexamination of the patent.

===Controversial trademarks===
* , &quot;Cloud Computing&quot; for Dell, covering &quot;custom manufacture of computer hardware for use in data centers and mega-scale computing environments for others&quot;, was allowed by a trademark attorney on July 8, 2008. Cloud computing is a generic term that could define technology infrastructure for years to come, which had been in general use at the time of the application. The application was rejected on August 12, 2008, as descriptive and generic.
* , &quot;Netbook&quot; for Psion, covering &quot;laptop computers&quot; was registered on November 21, 2000. Although the company discontinued the &quot;netBook&quot; line in November 2003 and allowed the trademark to become genericized through use by journalists and vendors (products marketed as &#x27;netbooks&#x27; include the Dell Inspiron Mini Series, Asus eeePC, HP Mini 1000, MSI Wind Netbook and others), USPTO subsequently rejected a number of trademarks citing a &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; under section 2(d), including &#x27;G NETBOOK&#x27; ( rejected October 31, 2008), MSI&#x27;s &#x27;WIND NETBOOK&#x27; () and Coby Electronics&#x27; &#x27;COBY NETBOOK&#x27; () rejected January 13, 2009. Psion also delivered a batch of cease-and-desist letters on December 23, 2008, relating to the genericized trademark.

===Slow patent examination and backlog===

The USPTO has been criticized for taking an inordinate amount of time in examining patent applications. This is particularly true in the fast-growing area of business method patents. As of 2005, patent examiners in the business method area were still examining patent applications filed in 2001.

The delay was attributed by spokesmen for the Patent Office to a combination of a sudden increase in business method patent filings after the 1998 &quot;State Street Bank&quot; decision, the unfamiliarity of patent examiners with the business and financial arts (e.g., banking, insurance, stock trading etc.), and the issuance of a number of controversial patents (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Amazon one click patent&quot;) in the business method area.

Effective August 2006, the USPTO introduced an accelerated patent examination procedure in an effort to allow inventors a speedy evaluation of an application with a final disposition within twelve months. The procedure requires additional information to be submitted with the application and also includes an interview with the examiner. The first accelerated patent was granted on March 15, 2007, with a six-month issuance time.

As of the end of 2008, there were 1,208,076 patent applications pending at the Patent Office. At the end of 1997, the number of applications pending was 275,295. Therefore, over those eleven years there was a 439% increase in the number of pending applications.

December 2012 data showed that there was 597,579 unexamined patent applications in the backlog. During the four years since 2009, more than a 50% reduction was achieved. First action pendency was reported as 19.2 months.

===Fraud by remote working employees===
In 2012, the USPTO initiated an internal investigation into allegations of fraud by employees taking advantage of its remote work policies. Investigators discovered that some patent examiners had lied about the hours they had worked, but high level officials prevented access to computer records, thus limiting the number of employees who could be punished.

<text>The Technology Administration (TA) was an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that worked with United States industries to promote economic competitiveness. The TA used the web domain technology.gov. The TA was most recently led by former Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology Robert Cresanti.

The TA oversaw three agencies:

* National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
* National Technical Information Service (NTIS)
* Office of Technology Policy (OTP)

==History==
The Technology Administration was created by the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, 15 U.S.C. 3704.

The TA was abolished by the America COMPETES Act of 2007. NIST and NTIS continue on as agencies. The Office of Technology Policy was abolished.

== Office of Technology Policy ==
The Office of Technology Policy (OTP) was an office of the Technology Administration. The office worked with industry to promote competitiveness and advocated integrated policies for maximizing the impact of technology on economic growth. The OTP&#x27;s stated goals included the creation of high-wage jobs and improvements in the United States&#x27; quality of life.

<text>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The primary mission of NTIS is to collect and organize scientific, technical, engineering, and business information generated by U.S. government-sponsored research and development, for private industry, government, academia, and the public. The systems, equipment, financial structure, and specialized staff skills that NTIS maintains to undertake its primary mission allow it to provide assistance to other agencies requiring such specialized resources.

==Overview==
Under the provisions of the National Technical Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 3704b), NTIS is authorized to establish and maintain a permanent repository of non-classified scientific, technical and engineering information; cooperate and coordinate its operations with other Government scientific, technical, and engineering information programs; and implement new methods or media for the dissemination of scientific, technical, and engineering information, including producing and disseminating information products in electronic format and to enter into arrangements necessary for the conduct of its business.

NTIS serves the United States as a central repository for government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business related information to assure businesses, libraries, academia, and the public timely access to approximately 2.5 million publications covering over 350 subject areas. The stated aim of NTIS is to support the Department of Commerce mission to promote the nation&#x27;s economic growth by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery. (Public Law 102-245, Section 108 American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991).

Additionally, NTIS acts as the federal government&#x27;s IT provider and consultant.

==Operations==
NTIS operations includes the acquisition and archiving in perpetuity of scientific and technical information. This information is freely available at no charge, by law. The cost of operating the site, however, must also by law be recovered from those using the site for anything beyond raw data access. There is a fee for use of the search tools.

NTIS also provides technical support services to other federal government agencies. These lines of business include:
* Shipping &amp; Fulfillment Services
* e-Training Services. NTIS is an OPM-approved eTraining Service Provider
* Federal Energy Data Management, mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005
* Government Web Hosting
* Scanning, Digitization &amp; Electronic Archive Services NTIS currently working with the Social Security Administration, National Science Foundation, Internal Revenue Service, and other Federal Agencies
* Other support services include Electronic &amp; Multimedia Services, Email Broadcast &amp; Fax Management, Billing &amp; Collections Services, and more

==Initiatives==

In 2008, NTIS recognized the need to provide subscription-based access to the collection using an online platform. Incrementally in 2009, and 2012, &quot;National Technical Reports Library&quot; (NTRS). &quot;Federal Science Repository Service&quot; (FTRS) followed V3 of NTRL.

NTIS has been working with Public.Resource.Org to digitize videos and to post content on YouTube.

==Statutory authorities==
NTIS&#x27; basic authority to operate a permanent clearinghouse of scientific and technical information is codified as chapter 23 of Title 15 of the United States Code (15 U.S.C. 1151-1157). This chapter also established NTIS&#x27; authority to charge fees for its products and services and to recover all costs through such fees &quot;to the extent feasible.&quot;
