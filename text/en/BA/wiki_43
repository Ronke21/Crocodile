<text>Christina Ricci ( ; born February 12, 1980) is an American actress known for playing unusual characters with a dark edge. Ricci works mostly in independent productions, but has also appeared in numerous box-office hits. She is the recipient of Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

Ricci made her film debut at the age of nine in &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), which was followed by a breakout role as Wednesday Addams in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991). Subsequent roles in &quot;Casper&quot; and &quot;Now and Then&quot; (both 1995) established her as a teen idol. At 17, she moved into adult-oriented independent projects such as &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; (1997), &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;, &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot;, &quot;Pecker&quot; (all 1998), &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; (2001), &quot;Pumpkin&quot; (2002), &quot;Monster&quot; (2003), and &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot; (2006).

On television, Ricci played Liza Bump on the fifth and final season of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (2002) and had a guest role on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in 2006, for which she received an Emmy Award nomination. She also starred on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Pan Am&quot; (2011–2012), produced and starred in the series &quot;The Lizzie Borden Chronicles&quot; (2015) and &quot;&quot; (2017), and appeared as Marilyn Thornhill on the first season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday&quot; in 2022. Ricci has played Misty Quigley on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; since 2021, receiving nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She voiced Catwoman / Selina Kyle in the animated series &quot;&quot; (2024).

In 2010, Ricci made her Broadway debut in the Donald Margulies play &quot;Time Stands Still&quot;. She is the national spokesperson for the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN).

==Early life and education==
Ricci was born in Santa Monica, California on February 12, 1980, the youngest of four children of Sarah (&quot;née&quot; Murdoch) and Ralph Ricci. Her father had a varied career, including jobs as a gym teacher, lawyer, drug counselor, and primal scream therapist. Ricci has previously referred to her father as a &quot;failed cult leader.&quot; Her mother worked as a Ford Agency model during the 1960s and later became a real estate agent. Regarding her surname, Ricci has stated that she has Italian, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.

Ricci&#x27;s family moved to Montclair, New Jersey, where she grew up attending Edgemont Elementary School, Glenfield Middle School, Montclair High School, and Morristown–Beard School. She later attended Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York City. Her three older siblings are Rafael, Dante, and Pia. Ricci&#x27;s parents separated when she was a preteen. She has been vocal about her childhood in interviews, particularly her parents&#x27; divorce and turbulent relationship with her father.

==Career==

===1990–1996: Discovery, child stardom and teen stardom===

At the age of eight, Ricci was discovered by a local theater critic when she starred in a school production of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. Another child was originally cast in the part, but Ricci devised a plan to secure the role for herself: she taunted her rival so much that he punched her. When she told on him, he lost the part. She later recalled, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been a really ambitious person. I guess that&#x27;s the first time it really reared its ugly head&quot;. Soon thereafter, she featured in a pair of spoof commercials on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The first of these featured Ricci at a birthday party in which biomedical waste fell out of a burst piñata, parodying the real-life dumping of waste in the rivers of the East Coast. This gained Ricci her SAG-AFTRA card.

Ricci&#x27;s film debut was in &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), where she played Kate Flax. She also appeared in the music video for &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song&quot;, which featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. She portrayed the morbidly precocious Wednesday Addams in the following year&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, Barry Sonnenfeld&#x27;s big-budget adaptation of the cartoon of the same name, and reprised the role for its 1993 follow-up, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. Both films were financially profitable, grossing over US$300 million between them. Critics singled out Ricci&#x27;s performance as a particular highlight of &quot;Values&quot;, with &quot;Variety&quot; believing she brought &quot;a depth to her character well beyond her years&quot;.

Ricci took on her first leading role when she headlined &quot;Casper&quot;, a supernatural comedy based on the Harvey Comics cartoon character. The film received a mixed critical reception, but was the eighth highest-grossing release of 1995. That same year, she starred in the children&#x27;s adventure movie &quot;Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain&quot; and played tomboy Roberta in the coming-of-age drama &quot;Now and Then&quot;. The latter is often cited as the &quot;female alternative&quot; to &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and has gained a sizeable cult following since its release. Ricci then played a supporting role in &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot; (1996), the directorial debut of Anjelica Huston, whom she previously worked with on the &quot;Addams Family&quot; movies. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Dorothy Allison, the film received acclaim for its sensitive handling of disturbing themes.

===1997–2004: Transition to adult roles ===
In 1997, Ricci starred in the Disney remake of &quot;That Darn Cat&quot;, which was a moderate success at the box office. Later that year, she made a shift into &quot;legitimate adult roles&quot; with her portrayal of the troubled, sexually curious Wendy Hood in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, a drama about dysfunctional family relationships. The part was originally given to Natalie Portman, who pulled out when her parents decided that the material was too provocative. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers wrote, &quot;The sight of the [film&#x27;s] young stars ... fiddling with each other may shock &#x27;90s prudes, but Lee handles these moments with dry wit and compassion ... The adolescent members of the cast do their characters proud, with Ricci a particular standout. Her wonderfully funny and touching performance, capturing the defiance and confusion that come with puberty, is the film&#x27;s crowning glory&quot;.

Ricci made a brief appearance in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s offbeat road movie, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998). That same year, she had starring roles in three features: firstly, &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;, with Roger Ebert describing her portrayal of abductee Layla as &quot;astonishing&quot;. Next up was John Waters&#x27; satirical comedy &quot;Pecker&quot;, where she played a hard-nosed laundromat worker, followed by Don Roos&#x27; dark comedy-drama &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot;, where she headlined as the acid-tongued, manipulative Dede. For the latter, Ricci garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for the 1999 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. In his review of &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy described Ricci&#x27;s portrayal of Dede as &quot;deadly funny&quot; and felt that she delivered her dialogue with &quot;the skill of a prospective Bette Davis&quot;. Several years later, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; singled out her performance as one of the biggest &quot;Oscar snubs&quot; of all time.

In 1999, Ricci headlined the Tim Burton gothic horror film &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, receiving the Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Katrina Van Tassel. She appeared as the guest host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in December that same year, performing parodies of Britney Spears and the Olsen twins. The episode drew attention due to Ricci unintentionally punching Ana Gasteyer in the face during one of the skits. Other film appearances around this time included the New Year&#x27;s Eve-set ensemble comedy &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; (1999); supernatural horror film &quot;Bless the Child&quot; (2000), where she played the drug-addicted Cheri; and &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot; (2000), in which she co-starred as a Jewish girl fleeing Soviet Russia. Critic Elvis Mitchell described her as &quot;transfixing&quot; in &quot;Cried&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that her &quot;dark-eyed loveliness&quot; conveyed a &quot;lifetime of sadness&quot;. In 2001, Ricci headlined &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;, an independent drama based on Elizabeth Wurtzel&#x27;s best-selling
memoir. The film—Ricci&#x27;s first outing as a producer—received mixed reviews, but critics agreed that Ricci was the highlight, with Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; describing her as &quot;splendid&quot;.

Ricci&#x27;s next role was in &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;, a drama based on the murder of Matthew Shepard. The 2002 film, which premiered on HBO, received positive reviews from critics; &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Matt Roush praised the performances of the cast, while noting that the film&#x27;s examination of homophobia could &quot;enlighten&quot; viewers. Later that year, she co-starred in the comedic British thriller &quot;Miranda&quot; and guest-starred on the fifth and final season of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, appearing as attorney Liza Bump in seven episodes. Meanwhile, she produced and starred in &quot;Pumpkin&quot; (2002), a black comedy about the relationship between a disabled young man and a sorority girl. In his review for &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;&quot;Pumpkin&quot; is alive, and takes chances, and uses the wicked blade of satire in order to show up the complacent political correctness of other movies in [its genre]. It refuses to play it safe. And there is courage in the performances—for example ... the way Ricci sails fearlessly into the risky material&quot;.

In 2003, Ricci took on the roles of a young amnesiac wandering through England on foot in the British horror film &quot;The Gathering&quot;; the former girlfriend of an up-and-coming movie star in Adam Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;I Love Your Work&quot;; and that of a vain, vindictive love interest in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Anything Else&quot;. In his review of the latter, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as an &quot;antiromantic comedy&quot; and said that Ricci played her role with &quot;feral, neurotic glee&quot;.

Next, Ricci co-starred in the biographical crime drama &quot;Monster&quot; (2003). Her character—Selby Wall—was a fictionalized version of Tyria Moore, the real-life girlfriend of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, played by Charlize Theron. Speaking of her decision to take the part, Ricci said it posed a challenge as it &quot;goes completely against who I am [as a person]&quot;. She described the filming experience as &quot;dark and depressing&quot;. The film was directed by Patty Jenkins and received rave reviews upon its release, with most critics directing their attention toward Theron, who went on to receive an Academy Award for her portrayal of Wuornos. She acknowledged Ricci during her acceptance speech, calling her the film&#x27;s &quot;unsung hero&quot;. Of Ricci&#x27;s performance, Roger Ebert said:

===2005–2017: Film, television, and theatre roles===
In 2005, Ricci provided vocals for &quot;Hell Yes&quot;, a track from the album &quot;Guero&quot; by American singer-songwriter Beck. Also that year, she headlined the Wes Craven horror film &quot;Cursed&quot;, which gained notoriety for its troubled production history. The following year, she appeared as a paramedic in two episodes of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Next, she played the title character in &quot;Penelope&quot; (2006), a rom-com based on the legends of pig-faced women. The role required Ricci to wear a prosthetic nose: &quot;We had a couple different noses that they tested at one point ... this really hideous, awfully unattractive snout [and] then there was this really cute Miss Piggy snout ... we ended up meeting somewhere in the middle&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; called the film a &quot;lovely fairy tale&quot;, while Andrea Gronvall of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; felt it was &quot;a worthy vehicle&quot; for Ricci. Similarly, David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that Ricci gave &quot;the fanciful script more grounding than it might otherwise have had&quot;, and critic Eric D. Snider said it was &quot;fun to see her in the most light-hearted role she&#x27;s played since... well, almost ever&quot;.

Ricci&#x27;s portrayal of nymphomaniac Rae Doole in the 2006 drama &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot; was particularly well received. She lost a significant amount of weight in preparation for the role, in order to make her character look &quot;unhealthy&quot;. The film was deemed controversial because of its dark and exploitative themes, but critics felt that Ricci was impressive; writing for &quot;Film Comment&quot;, Nathan Lee described her performance as &quot;fearless, specific, and blazingly committed&quot;, adding, &quot;She&#x27;s the white-hot focal point of [director] Brewer&#x27;s loud, brash, encompassing vision&quot;. Ricci appeared alongside Jackson for the second time in another 2006 film, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;, an ensemble drama following the lives of four soldiers in Iraq and their return to the United States.

Ricci co-starred as love interest Trixie in &quot;Speed Racer&quot; (2008), a US$120 million adaptation of the Japanese manga series of the same name. Directed by the Wachowskis, it received mixed reviews upon release and was a financial failure; some critics later reappraised it as a masterpiece. That same year, she appeared in a segment of the anthology drama &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, directed by Shunji Iwai.

In 2009, Ricci appeared in three episodes of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Saving Grace&quot; during its second season, as a detective who teams up with the show&#x27;s main character. Also that year, she co-starred in the psychological thriller &quot;After.Life&quot;, with &quot;Fangoria&quot; stating that she embodied her character—a teacher who dies in a car accident—&quot;in compelling fashion&quot;. Next, Ricci made her Broadway debut in Donald Margulies&#x27; play &quot;Time Stands Still&quot;. Her first public performance was on September 23, 2010, at the Cort Theatre. Though she admitted to suffering from extreme bouts of stage fright during the show&#x27;s four-month run, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her portrayal of Mandy as &quot;confident&quot; and &quot;appealing&quot;.

Ricci played a kindhearted waitress in &quot;Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star&quot; (2011), a comedy written by Adam Sandler. The film was universally panned by critics. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Andrew Barker called it &quot;one of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year&quot;, but commended Ricci, who he felt gave her role &quot;more than it deserves&quot;. From 2011 to 2012, she starred as stewardess Maggie Ryan on the ABC drama series &quot;Pan Am&quot;, which was set in the 1960s and based on the airline of the same name. The series garnered generally positive reviews, but, due to a decline in viewing figures during its initial run of 14 episodes, the producers decided not to proceed with a second season. In April 2012, Ricci returned to the stage, playing Hermia in an off-Broadway revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Next, Ricci adopted a British accent when she co-starred as a promiscuous young housewife in &quot;Bel Ami&quot; (2012), a period drama based on the 1885 novel of the same name. Roger Ebert said in his review, &quot;The surprise for me is Christina Ricci [who] flowers here in warm ripeness. Her character makes the mistake of actually loving Georges. This involves pure acting skill on her part, since Pattinson gives her so little to work with&quot;. She headlined the Australian film &quot;Around The Block&quot; the same year, playing an American drama teacher who befriends an Aboriginal boy during the 2004 Redfern riots. &quot;Variety&quot; Joe Leydon described the independent drama as &quot;well-intended yet cliche-ridden&quot;, but felt that Ricci brought &quot;allure&quot; to her role. She subsequently provided voices for the animated films &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Hero of Color City&quot; (2014).

In 2014, Ricci played the title character in &quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Ax&quot;, a Lifetime film inspired by the true story of Borden, who was tried and acquitted of the murders of her father and stepmother in 1892. She reprised the role in 2015 for &quot;The Lizzie Borden Chronicles&quot;, which she also produced. The eight-part series was met with generally positive reviews; Jane Borden of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called it &quot;playful, wicked brain candy&quot;, adding that &quot;Ricci was born to play [a] 19th-century ax murderer&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Neil Genzlinger described her as &quot;gleeful and ruthless&quot;, while Keith Uhlich of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that she and co-star Clea DuVall had &quot;a delectable rapport not too far removed from Bette Davis and Joan Crawford at their hag-horror peak in &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;&quot;, adding, 
&quot;There&#x27;s a winking self-consciousness to [Ricci&#x27;s] portrayal of Lizzie that works to the character&#x27;s advantage; she&#x27;s like an out-of-time avenging angel, a feminist icon (before there were words to describe it) lashing out at patriarchy the only way she knows how&quot;. Ricci went on to receive a nomination for the 2016 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries.

In the independent ensemble drama &quot;Mothers and Daughters&quot; (2016), Ricci played a woman who receives life-changing news from an estranged relative. Her next project was the 2017 Amazon Video miniseries &quot;&quot;, in which she starred as a fictionalized version of American socialite Zelda Fitzgerald. She also served as a producer on the series, which, she later acknowledged, is how she got the part: &quot;I can tell you that in my experience, I have never, ever been cast in a role like this and I would never get this part normally ... I&#x27;m just not seen in that way. There are categories that people fall into … and I was never a romantic lead. Basically, you couldn&#x27;t get five people in a room to agree that I should be a romantic lead. I could get one person, but there&#x27;s always more than one person whose opinion matters&quot;. Writing for &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;, Matt Fagerholm said of Ricci&#x27;s performance:

===2018–present: Film work and &quot;Yellowjackets&quot;===

In the 2018 psychological thriller &quot;Distorted&quot;, Ricci starred as a woman suffering from bipolar disorder. The film received a mixed reception from critics, who cited Ricci&#x27;s performance as a highlight. Her next film projects were &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021), in which she re-teamed with the Wachowskis to play a colleague of Thomas Anderson, and the 2022 supernatural thriller &quot;Monstrous&quot;, where she starred as a mother trying to protect her son from evil forces in 1950s California. In their review of the latter, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said of Ricci, &quot;The key to this film&#x27;s success rests on [her] shoulders … She can play into the darling quaint lifestyle of a 50s woman and then let out a shrill scream of fear and terror that can put most scream queens to shame. But her natural gift is her ability to act with her eyes; a single glance, a slight twitch, or a dead-on stare do more to communicate [her character&#x27;s] feelings and situation than any piece of dialogue in the script. To that end, &quot;Monstrous&quot; utilizes [her] talents brilliantly&quot;.

For her portrayal of Misty Quigley on the Showtime series &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; (2021–present), Ricci was nominated for the 2022 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Following the lives of four women who survived a plane crash when they were teenagers, the show has received rave reviews from critics. Commenting on Ricci&#x27;s performance, &quot;Digital Spy&quot;″s Gabriella Geisinger called it &quot;nuanced and dynamic&quot;, adding that it &quot;winds sadness and strength together with ease and is as captivating as it is bananas&quot;. On playing Misty, a sadistic healthcare worker and societal &quot;outsider&quot;, Ricci said, &quot;People really do connect with that need [she] has that motivates everything, which is to be accepted, to be a part of the group … But what&#x27;s interesting about this character and what I think these writers do so adeptly is, they show you how badly she wants to be there, and then they show you the reason why she deserves to be kicked out … [also] after years and years of being stepped on and dismissed and not accepted … [she is] very much at a point where she&#x27;s like, &#x27;Well, no one&#x27;s ever going to give it to me. So I&#x27;m going to fucking take it&#x27;&quot;.

In March 2022, it was announced that Ricci had been cast in the Tim Burton-directed Netflix series &quot;Wednesday&quot;, detailing the school years of Wednesday Addams, who Ricci played previously in the 1990s. Ricci appeared as series regular Marilyn Thornhill, a teacher at Nevermore Academy. Speaking of her involvement with the project, she said, &quot;I knew there would be comparison between the old [&quot;Addams Family&quot;] movies and &quot;Wednesday&quot;. That&#x27;s a natural inclination. But the &#x27;who was a better Wednesday?&#x27; thing is unreal. I loved being Wednesday. I&#x27;m
very proud of that role … [but] I also think [series star] Jenna Ortega is amazing. She is so brave, so cool, and really doing the part justice. Wednesday is her part now&quot;. A substantial ratings success when it premiered in November 2022, the show received critical acclaim, with &quot;Collider&quot; saying of Ricci, &quot;[she] plays [Thornhill] so well you can&#x27;t help but be glued to her every move when she&#x27;s on-screen&quot;.

Ricci starred as DC Comics supervillain Harley Quinn in the seven-part podcast series &quot;Harley Quinn and The Joker: Sound Mind&quot;, released by Spotify in January 2023. In August the same year, she played a frightened homeowner whose bedroom is haunted by a razor-clawed &quot;Doja Devil&quot; in the music video for &quot;Demons&quot;, a song by American rapper and singer Doja Cat. Charisma Madarang of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the video as &quot;a stunning flex of macabre&quot;, noting its homages to classic horror films.

==Acting style and reception==

Ricci has no formal acting training. &quot;People explained things to me in very simple ways when I was a child on set&quot;, she said in 2012. &quot;Then as I got older I started understanding things in more complicated ways and [created] my own mind games, methods and rules in my head&quot;. She later explained, &quot;It&#x27;s such a weird, completely internal [thing]. Every actor works in a different way … [Personally] I just take the script and I figure out a way to deliver what needs to be delivered&quot;.

Ricci earned a reputation as a goth in the 1990s through her work in the &quot;Addams Family&quot; films and other portrayals of &quot;dark, quirky&quot; characters. Tim Burton once described her as having an &quot;ambiguous quality&quot;: &quot;She looks at you and you get a definite feeling, but you&#x27;re not quite sure what that feeling is&quot;.

Ricci told a journalist in 2022 that casting directors were often reluctant to place her in certain projects when she was younger: &quot;At that time, I did a lot of indies because, in mainstream movies, there was still a lot of leading-lady standards that I didn&#x27;t fall into&quot;. She told &quot;NME&quot; that same year: &quot;My agents [used to say], &#x27;We have to be so careful you don&#x27;t become a character actress. If we&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;re going to end up just like Jennifer Jason Leigh&#x27;. I was like, [but] &#x27;I like her&#x27;. They were so afraid of me not being a leading lady, of me not being sexually attractive to people&quot;.

==Personal life==

Ricci has been open about her past struggles with anxiety and anorexia.

She has eight tattoos on her body: a lion on her right shoulder blade (a reference to &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, a favorite novel of hers as a child); an Edward Gorey figure on the inside of her right wrist; a pair of praying hands on her left hip (this tattoo was originally a bat); the name &quot;Jack&quot; on her right thigh for a deceased pet; a sparrow on her right breast; and a mermaid on her left ankle. She also has the words &quot;Move or Bleed&quot; on the left side of her rib cage, as well as a bouquet of sweet peas on her lower back.

Ricci is listed in several art publications as one of artist Mark Ryden&#x27;s muses. Her image has appeared in several of his oil paintings and sketches.

===Relationships and family===
Ricci began dating comedian and actor Owen Benjamin in 2008 after they met on the set of the film &quot;All&#x27;s Faire in Love&quot;. They became engaged in March 2009, but ended the engagement two months later.

In February 2013, Ricci announced her engagement to dolly grip James Heerdegen, whom she met while working on the series &quot;Pan Am&quot; in 2012. They married on October 26, 2013, in Manhattan. They have a son, born in August 2014. On July 2, 2020, Ricci filed for divorce. In her divorce filing, Ricci stated that she was subjected to &quot;severe physical and emotional abuse&quot; by Heerdegen and that &quot;many of these acts of abuse&quot; took place in front of their son. The Los Angeles Police Department had previously responded to a call at Ricci and Heerdegen&#x27;s Woodland Hills home on June 25, 2020. Heerdegen was not arrested, but Ricci was granted an emergency protective order against Heerdegen the day before she filed for divorce. The order prohibited any contact between the couple. In January 2021, Ricci was granted a Domestic Abuse Restraining Order against Heerdegen. In April 2021, Ricci was granted full custody of their son, while Heerdegen was given visitation rights.

In October 2021, Ricci announced her marriage to hairstylist Mark Hampton. Their daughter was born in December 2021.

===Activism===

Ricci has been the national spokesperson for the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) since April 25, 2007. She wrote an article for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2009, where she spoke about how her work with the organisation had affected her: &quot;[Victims] tell me of the struggles they face every day&quot;, she said, &quot;and the hurdles they&#x27;ve had to overcome.&quot;

Due to public backlash after PETA named Ricci on their &quot;Worst Dressed&quot; list in 2006 for wearing reindeer fur on the cover of &quot;W&quot;, Ricci announced that she would stop wearing animal fur altogether. In response, PETA removed her from the list.

<text>The Happy Ending is a 1969 American drama film written and directed by Richard Brooks, which tells the story of a repressed housewife who longs for liberation from her husband and daughter. It stars Jean Simmons (who received an Oscar nomination), John Forsythe, Shirley Jones, Lloyd Bridges and Teresa Wright.

==Plot==
1953: Through the course of a Colorado autumn and winter, Mary Spencer and Fred Wilson lead an idyllic existence. Mary drops out of college (with 6 months to go) to marry Fred. Their perfect wedding mirrors the happy endings of the films Mary loves.

1969: It is the Wilson&#x27;s 16th wedding anniversary. On his way to work, Fred, a successful tax consultant, tells their maid Agnes that he has found vodka hidden in Mary&#x27;s wardrobe and asks Agnes to keep an eye on his wife. Mary sets out for the beauty parlor. At an airline office, however, Mary buys a one-way ticket to Nassau, Bahamas, looking for an escape from her dull and unhappy suburban life.

On the flight she recalls the horrors of last year&#x27;s anniversary party, when Fred drunkenly flirted with a blonde divorcee, and she took refuge in the bottle and a rerun of &quot;Casablanca.&quot; At a stop-over, she calls home and learns this year&#x27;s anniversary party has been a different sort of disaster. Her teenage daughter Marge is scared by Mary&#x27;s call, as it reminds her of the time she had found her mother unconscious after an overdose.

En route to Nassau, Mary meets Flo, an old college friend she has not seen since 1953. While Mary settled down to married life, Flo has been the mistress of a series of married men, lives a carefree and hedonistic lifestyle, and has fully embraced the sexual revolution. She is on her way to Nassau to meet her latest beau, Sam. Mary tells her she has had to get away from Fred, so Flo promises to look after her.

In the Bahamas, Mary enjoys the sun and long, empty stretches of beach. At a casino, she meets Franco, a hustler from Los Angeles who is down on his luck. Franco mistakenly assumes that Mary is wealthy. He affects an Italian accent and tells Mary he is a journalist who writes about film stars. She agrees to go to &quot;his&quot; boat, but when he learns Mary is not wealthy, Franco quickly loses interest, confessing his scam.

Walking by the ocean, Mary recalls the occasion of her suicide attempt — she had returned from having a face lift to learn that Fred was in Reno with a girl. Marge had found her in danger of death and rushed her to hospital. After that, Mary resumed drinking, recklessly spent a lot of money, and crashed her car while driving drunk.

In the present, Sam proposes to Flo, who accepts. Mary flies back home. Agnes helps her move into rooms she has rented away from Fred and Marge. She takes a job and enrolls in night classes at the university. It is at the college where Fred finds Mary one evening. He asks, &quot;What went wrong? All our friends are married, and they&#x27;re happy...or seem to be. Alright, they put up with it. But without marriage, life would be disorganized, crazy.&quot; Her reply: &quot;People in love are crazy.&quot; They tell one another they still love each other, but &quot;it&#x27;s not enough,&quot; she says. After some more conversation as he walks her toward the university entrance, she asks &quot;If we were not married, would you marry me again?&quot; The look on his face and lack of an affirmative answer says it all.

==Production==

Music for the film was composed and conducted by Michel Legrand, the song lyrics by Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman. The soundtrack performance of &quot;What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?&quot; was sung by Michael Dees and the soundtrack songs &quot;Hurry Up &#x27;N Hurry Down&quot; and &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; were performed by William Eaton. The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Jean Simmons) and Best Music, Song (Michel Legrand, Alan Bergman, and Marilyn Bergman for &quot;What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?&quot;). The song was one of the eight pieces of music chosen by Jean Simmons when she appeared on the BBC radio program &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 9 August 1975.

==Critical reception==
In &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Richard Schickel gave a negative review, describing the film as a &quot;melodramatic travesty&quot; and criticizing its unlikeable characters. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Vincent Canby was also critical, writing &quot;The Happy Ending&quot; &quot;is a kind of false &quot;Faces&quot;—a movie that set out to expose the kitsch of Hollywood fantasy&quot;.

In 2020, Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; gave a retrospective review in which he praised the film. He wrote, &quot;The shudderingly impassioned, history-jangled, cinema-centric drama &#x27;The Happy Ending,&#x27; from 1969, reflects vast changes in Hollywood and in American society, and even nudges them ahead. What&#x27;s more, it does so aesthetically, with startlingly expressive images and performances that fuse with the action to reflect on—and advance—the state of movies themselves.&quot;

<text>, also known as 2ch, Channel 2, and sometimes retrospectively as 2ch.net, was an anonymous Japanese textboard founded in 1999 by Hiroyuki Nishimura. Described in 2007 as &quot;Japan&#x27;s most popular online community&quot;, the site had a level of influence comparable to that of traditional mass media such as television, radio, and magazines. At the time, the site drew an annual revenue of around (about US$1 million), and was the largest of its kind in the world, with around ten million visitors and 2.5 million posts made per day.

The site was hosted and had its domain registration provided by Jim Watkins, based in San Francisco, California. In 2009, ownership of the site was transferred to Singapore-based Packet Monster Inc., under which Nishimura remained in control. In February 2014, Watkins seized the 2ch.net domain, taking full control over the website and assuming the role of site administrator. This has resulted in two textboards claiming to be the legitimate 2channel: 2ch.sc, owned by Nishimura through Packet Monster Inc., and , established in 2017 by redirect from the original domain and owned by Watkins through Philippines-based Loki Technology Inc.

2channel and its successors are more controversial than other social media in Japan; they are extremely popular among Japan&#x27;s extreme right-wing, known as the &quot;netto-uyoku&quot;, who post xenophobic comments, often targeting Koreans and Chinese. Defamation is of particular concern; by August 2008, Nishimura had received more than one hundred lawsuits for defamatory comments left on the website. Announcements of crimes also have drawn scrutiny of 2channel and its successors. In 2012, 2channel was accused by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police of allowing its platform to be used by amphetamine dealers, although no charges were filed.

In September 2007, 2channel claimed over 2.4 million posts per day. As of July 2020, 5channel claimed 1,031 boards receiving around 2.7 million posts per day on weekends, with no growth since March 2016. Meanwhile, 2ch.sc claimed 826 boards receiving around 5,700 posts daily.

==History==
=== Predecessors ===
Textboards like 2channel were rooted in two earlier technologies: dial-in bulletin boards, known in Japan as , and Usenet. 2channel has two predecessors: Ayashii World created in 1996 by Shiba Masayuki, and , created in 1997. Ayashii World was the first large anonymous web bulletin board in Japan, while Amezou originated the more familiar &quot;textboard&quot; concept wherein threads are displayed chronologically, with new comments bumping old threads to the top, rather than in a branching tree. Ayashii World closed in 1998, leading most of its former users to go to Amezou; Nishimura advertised 2channel in a post on Amezou in May 1999, calling it &quot;Amezou&#x27;s second channel&quot;. From June, Amezou became increasingly unable to handle the load on its servers, until its host shut it down after threats against Amezou&#x27;s anonymous owner which contained his dox were posted on it.

=== Early history ===
2channel was founded on 30 May 1999 in a college apartment in Conway, Arkansas on the campus of University of Central Arkansas by Hiroyuki Nishimura. Success came quickly; many of Amezou&#x27;s users began using it as soon as it opened. When compared with other bulletin boards, 2channel&#x27;s technology wasn&#x27;t much different; what led to its success was instead its being an &quot;outlet for unfettered expression&quot;; by being hosted in the United States, 2channel was able to bypass more restrictive Japanese censorship rules, while still being accessible from Japan. The site also enjoyed greater immunity from legal action within Japan due to the location of its servers. By 2002, Google said that the most searched word in Japan was &quot;2channel&quot;. By 2004, 2channel was already the largest internet forum in Japan.

The name &quot;2channel&quot; is a reference to VHF channel 2, the default setting for the RF modulators used in earlier-generation game consoles (such as Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer) when connecting to Japanese television sets. Where Amezou was originally meant to be &quot;channel one&quot;, 2channel was meant to be &quot;channel two&quot;. The site&#x27;s iconic jar logo is a reference to deprecatory remarks some former users of Ayashii World would make about 2channel early on in the site&#x27;s history, likening it to a . Nishimura took this nickname and adopted it as the site&#x27;s logo by 2002.

Jim Watkins, an ex-US army non-commissioned officer (sergeant first class), domain name registrar, and dedicated hosting service provider, hosted 2channel since at least 2004 through various corporate identities, including Big-server.com Inc., Pacific Internet Exchange LLC and N. T. Technology Inc. Before 2channel, Watkins&#x27; company primarily specialized in using servers and domains in the United States to serve uncensored pornographic content to users in Japan.

=== Ownership transfer and government scrutiny ===
On 2 January 2009, Nishimura claimed to have transferred ownership of 2channel to Packet Monster Inc., a company based in Chinatown, Singapore, and to no longer be involved in the site&#x27;s management. However, Nishimura was charged with violating Japanese narcotic control laws anyway on 20 December 2012. As part of their case, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) claimed Nishimura remained involved in 2channel&#x27;s operations, alleging Packet Monster Inc. is a . The main thrust of the complaint was that Nishimura allegedly did not delete posts seeking to purchase illicit amphetamine from other 2channel users online; the , an agency of the MPD, alleged that in 2011 97% of its 5,223 deletion requests did not result in deletion. On 19 March 2013, the Public Prosecutors Office decided not to prosecute the case.

In August 2013, the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau declared in a tax audit that Nishimura had failed to declare worth of website revenue which should have been taxed between 2009 and 2012, years in which he financially benefited from Packet Monster Inc.; Nishimura settled the matter by paying the owed tax, .

=== Personal information leak ===
In August 2013, a hacker using the name the personal details (including names, addresses, and phone numbers) and credit card numbers of thousands of 2channel users who had used 2channel&#x27;s paid services into the public domain, exposing the anonymous profiles of various high level personas such as politicians and writers, including an attorney involved in 2channel cases, , and a staff member of AKB48. More than 74,000 users had their personal information exposed by the leak.

The paid service involved in the leak was known as the , or . Its main utility was that it allowed users to read old threads; if a thread on 2channel received 1,000 posts, it would become part of the by a process of of such threads, after which time a thread was no longer freely accessible. 2channel charged per year for the service, which was typically paid by credit card; logs of these payments were the source of the data leak.

At the time of the leak, Watkins apologized on behalf of N. T. Technology, Inc., saying he was the victim of a &quot;cyber attack&quot; and that &quot;some data [of my] customers was compromised.&quot;

=== Domain seizure and split ===

On 19 February 2014, Jim Watkins, as chairman of N.T. Technology, Inc., 2channel&#x27;s domain registrar, seized 2channel&#x27;s domain. He took full control over the website, relieved Nishimura of all power, and assumed the role of website administrator. Watkins made the &quot;kako rogu&quot; free to all users shortly after assuming control.

Watkins claimed that Nishimura had failed to pay him money owed which led to the seizure as a way to cover Nishimura&#x27;s debts, while Nishimura claimed that he had in fact paid everything owed and that the domain transfer was an illegal domain hijacking. In response, Nishimura created his own clone of 2channel at , scraping the contents of the entire 2channel website and updating 2ch.sc as new posts appeared on 2ch.net. In a Q&amp;A session on 4chan shortly after becoming the site&#x27;s owner, Nishimura claimed that 2channel was stolen by Watkins.

Nishimura has attempted to repossess the domain both through WIPO&#x27;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy and through the Japanese court system. Through the Japan Patent Office, Nishimura owns the trademark &quot;2channel&quot;, though the WIPO refused to intervene on his behalf on account of that, suggesting the parties go to court instead as it was not, in its view, a case of &quot;cybersquatting&quot; but rather a &quot;business dispute&quot;.

Ron Watkins, Jim&#x27;s son, in 2016 registered the trademark &quot;5channel&quot; in Japan. On 1 October 2017, 2ch.net began redirecting to 5ch.net, a domain owned by Loki Technology, Inc. The chairman of Loki Technology Inc. is also Jim Watkins; his wife, Liziel, is the treasurer and majority shareholder. According to a press release, the name was changed to 5channel to avoid potential legal issues due to Nishimura&#x27;s ownership of the &quot;2channel&quot; trademark.
==Culture==

Due to its large number of boards, the types of information exchanged on 2channel are very diverse. There are boards for topics as diverse as sports, sex, celebrity gossip, computer programming and ongoing earthquakes; even some academic research has gotten its start on 2channel.

===Anonymous posting===
One of the most distinctive features of 2channel is its use of anonymous posting. Nishimura explained his reasons for preferring anonymity online to USC Annenberg&#x27;s &quot;Japan Media Review&quot; thus:

If there is a user ID attached to a user, a discussion tends to become a criticizing game. On the other hand, under the anonymous system, even though your opinion/information is criticized, you don&#x27;t know with whom to be upset. Also with a user ID, those who participate in the site for a long time tend to have authority, and it becomes difficult for a user to disagree with them. Under a perfectly anonymous system, you can say, &quot;it&#x27;s boring,&quot; if it is actually boring. All information is treated equally; only an accurate argument will work.

However, a frequent criticism directed toward anonymous textboards like 2channel, most notably by Kazuhiko Nishi, is that their anonymous nature make them mere . 2channel&#x27;s anonymity is a departure from most English language internet forums which require some form of registration, usually coupled with email verification for further identification of an individual; its anonymity in part inspired the creation of 4chan. On 2channel, a name field is available, but it is seldom used. However, as open proxies such as the Tor network are banned from posting on 2channel, the administrators have some degree of ability to help law enforcement unmask users if necessary.

=== Revenue ===
While 2channel and its successors are commercial, 2channel was moderated by volunteers. 2channel relied on advertisements from &quot;obscure&quot; companies. In 2007, it had an annual revenue of around . Between 2009 and 2012, in ad profits were transferred to Nishimura&#x27;s Singaporean shell company.

As early as 2004, companies such as Dentsu were data mining the website for their clients, keeping them informed of how they were being portrayed by 2channel users; by 2006, 75% of the content Dentsu analyzed on behalf of its customers was posted to 2channel.

2channel also received revenue from subscription services like the aforementioned &quot;maru&quot;. For its part, 5channel has a subscription service, , that allows people outside Japan to post on it; this service also hides ads from its subscribers.

====&quot;Matome&quot;====
2channel historically allowed anyone to use its data, providing it in an easily parsable format; this made it simple to create third party &quot;dedicated browsers&quot; () for posting on and using 2channel. The openness of the data allowed for the proliferation of and , which summarize 2channel threads and attempt to collect what they see as the &quot;best of&quot; 2channel. In 2007, due to growing discontentment towards such sites, Nishimura added a board, /poverty/, which marked every post on it with the phrase . This caused many users to abandon other boards for that board.

Watkins made it a priority to combat &quot;piracy&quot; of 5channel by third-party &quot;matome&quot; sites in March 2014, adding &quot;tensai kinshi&quot; to many popular boards. Such sites siphon users from 2channel itself, with some receiving in excess of 100 million monthly pageviews; in one case a &quot;matome&quot; site earned its owner per month. Watkins followed up the rule change by restricting access to 2channel&#x27;s data in March 2015, by requiring that dedicated browser authors use a special API to access 2channel&#x27;s, and later 5channel&#x27;s, thread data. On 10 July 2023, Jane, a company that provided a 5channel API server, terminated its 5channel API service, thus ending several applications&#x27; support for the site. Some browsers, including Jane&#x27;s, replaced their support for 5channel with another anonymous textboard site named Talk.

===Phenomena===

====&quot;Densha Otoko&quot;====
&quot;Densha Otoko&quot; is a Japanese franchise consisting of a movie, television series, manga, and other media, all based on the purportedly true story of a 23-year-old man who intervened when a drunk man started to harass several women on a train. The man ultimately begins dating one of the women. The event and the man&#x27;s subsequent dates with the woman, chronicled on 2channel, directly inspired the franchise. Whether or not the original 2channel story is actually true is debated.

==== Shift_JIS art ====

2channel and its successors, being textboards, cannot have images posted to them. Users get around this, however, by posting a more expressive form of ASCII art: Shift_JIS art. Below is a small sample:

====Political activism====
2channel and other websites with &quot;chan&quot; in their name have been known for activism done by their users for a variety of causes.

== Controversies ==
===Slander and legal issues===
During Hiroyuki&#x27;s administration, he was often openly defiant of Japanese law, especially around libel, and his duty to follow it, telling &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; in March 2007:

By May 2008, Nishimura had lost more than fifty libel lawsuits in Japanese civil courts, and had been assessed millions of dollars in penalties; by August, according to him, he&#x27;d received more than one hundred lawsuits. While according to the official pages of the website, slander was prohibited, activists such as Debito Arudou claimed that the site did not actually respond to requests to delete posts in his case, returning mail unopened. After the transfer to Packet Monster Inc., Arudou, who had still not received any of the court ordered penalty, wrote in an op-ed that Nishimura had only transferred his assets to increase his &quot;unaccountability&quot;. While Nishimura at that point had never paid any of the compensation courts ordered in his cases, in 2010 one of his plaintiffs was successful in getting compensated through the publisher of one of Nishimura&#x27;s books.

=== Crime announcements ===
 were a regular occurrence on 2channel, including of mass suicides and murders. After the 2000 Neomugicha incident, in which a bus was hijacked by a Teenager who posted on 2channel, police officers started regularly policing 2channel; such surveillance only increased after the Akihabara massacre announced his 2008 attack on 2channel as well. Former superintendent of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Tateshi Higuchi called the site a &quot;den of iniquity&quot;. According to &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, however, 2channel cooperated with police in the past to aid them in catching criminals using 2channel by giving police their IP addresses, from which their locations were determined.

Such crime announcements have continued to be a problem on 5channel: it was speculated that the man who carried out the Kyoto Animation arson attack posted an advance warning of the crime on 5channel.

===Far-right nationalism and anti-Korean hate speech===

2channel, with its massive size and anonymous posting, is abundant with slander, hate speech and defamation against public figures, institutions, and minority ethnic groups. Far-right users of 2channel are referred to as &quot;netto-uyoku&quot;, a term roughly analogous to &quot;alt-right&quot;. Though the site has rules against posts illegal under Japanese law, the scale and anonymous nature of the site makes prompt deletions difficult to realize in practice. Furthermore, on occasion, 2channel has been accused of being reluctant to remove defamatory posts. The discussion boards are also often used to coordinate real-life demonstrations; as an example, 2channel users organized an August 2011 rally against Fuji Television, their complaint being that the channel was broadcasting too many Korean television shows. &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; reported in 2018 that 5channel, which received most of 2channel&#x27;s users, has the same reputation for attracting &quot;netto-uyoku&quot;.

2channel &quot;netto-uyoku&quot; frequently make racist comments against Koreans. In 2009, it was even discovered that an &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; employee had posted racist remarks towards Koreans on 2channel. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, fake news proliferated on 2channel, falsely accusing Chinese and Korean people of &quot;plundering&quot; evacuation centers.

== Technology ==
2channel operated on forum software that was considered innovative at the time of its founding, originally written by Hiroyuki himself, but later replaced through the collective effort of his Unix-savvy users; the software is known as . It was a major departure from Usenet; however, when compared to other Japanese textboards at the time, such as Amezou, 2channel&#x27;s format was not much different.

Boards in the textboard software have their threads sorted by the time of their last post, so making a post would the thread to the top of the board index. However, when posting in a thread, users may use a function known as to avoid bumping a thread in this way. Often, posters will use on purpose, to avoid unwanted attention.

=== Major outages ===

==== 2010–2011 Korean DDoS ====
In response to racism towards Koreans by 2channel users, especially against Yuna Kim, an athlete who defeated Japan in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, the site suffered an extended outage in March 2010 due to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack conducted by a Korean hacking group. The attack against Jim Watkins&#x27; Pacific Internet Exchange LLC affected other sites on the shared network as well, including some belonging to US government agencies; it is estimated to have cost . Watkins requested the American government investigate the event as an instance of &quot;cyberterrorism&quot;; according to him, sporadic DDoS attacks by Koreans continued into 2011.

==== 2015 8chan DDoS ====
Beginning on 8 January 2015, 8chan, also owned by Jim Watkins and hosted on the network of N. T. Technology, Inc., suffered an outage due to a DDoS attack. Due to the attack, 2ch.net, then owned by Watkins but not yet operated under the name 5channel, went down as well. The attacks against the messageboards lasted until at least 13 January, leading &quot;many 2channel users to become angry with the management&quot;.

== Societal impact ==
In September 2007, 2channel averaged over 2.4 million posts per day. As of July 2020, 5channel had 1,031 boards receiving around 2.7 million posts per day on weekends, with no growth since March 2016. Meanwhile, 2ch.sc then had 826 boards receiving around 5,700 posts daily. Due to its popularity, 2channel and its successors have had considerable influence on Japanese society.

=== Children&#x27;s use of 2channel ===
Use of sites like 2channel by minors is a major concern in Japan. Some children&#x27;s search sites, such as the now-defunct , filtered textboards like 2channel. In Tokyo, a local ordinance requires that internet service providers develop filters to prevent minors from accessing sites which could harm the &quot;sound and wholesome fostering [of their youth]&quot;; they must also confirm before installing a connection if any minors live in the household.

Despite this, however, web filter provider Net Star in February 2007 released the results of a survey which showed that the utilization rate of 2channel for primary and secondary students was 12.2%. In response to threads on 2channel about certain schools which were leading to cyberbullying, the Ministry of Education in 2008 released a 65-page manual for teachers and parents on how to handle the issue. Concerned about the popularity of 2channel among children and teenagers, a team of childhood education professors at the University of the Ryukyus in 2009 published a paper making recommendations to lawmakers on how to curb such use.

In February 2020, Nishimura himself wrote an op-ed in &quot;Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun&quot; warning parents about the dangers of allowing their children unfettered access to social media sites like YouTube and 2channel.

=== Politicians and 2channel ===
Naoto Kan, a future Prime Minister who was then a member of the National Diet, sent a legal notice on 10 May 2000 demanding that 2channel delete a post by someone falsely claiming to be him.

After the Liberal Democratic Party presidential election in 2007, Prime Minister Tarō Asō stated in a Fuji TV interview that he sometimes posts on 2channel. During each election season, supporting posts for perennial candidates Matayoshi Jesus and Mac Akasaka were frequently made on 2channel, turning them into something of a meme, similar to the repeated candidacies of Vermin Supreme in the United States. After more than ten failed candidacies for various political offices, including Governor of Tokyo, Akasaka was eventually elected to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, representing Minato, in April 2019. &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; credited Akasaka&#x27;s online fame with helping him win the surprise victory.

=== 2channel in the media ===

Japanese news organizations often relied on 2channel to determine the issues the public was thinking about, and for leads. However, the mass media often reports on it negatively, similar to how it reported on &quot;otaku&quot; culture a decade ago, before it went more mainstream, even though internet trends nowadays routinely slip through into other media. The phrase , when used in reporting, may refer either to 2channel or to other forums. Movements spawned on 2channel often receive media attention, noting how the methods of 2channel activists break socially normative behavior and bring pressure to bear through sheer numbers. Beyond this, though, 2channel posts were often a basis for media reports in Japan.

TV programs have even featured 2channel&#x27;s moderators and users; comedian Hikari Ōta, for example, criticized Nishimura during a discussion on the Tokyo Broadcasting System&#x27;s &quot;Sandējapon&quot; on the ideal limits of free expression as applied to social networks.

&quot;Shokun!&quot; magazine, during its operation, ran a column known as which shared &quot;patriotic&quot; 2channel posts. &quot;Weekly Bunshun&quot;, published by Bungeishunjū), meanwhile, has been criticized for being seen as overly pro-2channel and relying on its posts too much in its reporting.

<doc id="217798" wikidata="Q842977" url="?curid=217798" title="Hiroyuki Nishimura">
<text>is a Japanese internet entrepreneur. He founded the message board 2channel, and is an administrator of 4chan. He is also a self-help author and TV personality. He is often known by his given name, , which he uses, rendered intentionally in lowercase, both as a pen name and as a username.

Until February 2013, he was a director of, and advisor to, Niwango, operator of the video-sharing service niconico.

Christopher Poole, the founder of 4chan, formally announced on 21 September 2015, that he had sold the website to Nishimura. After a dispute with 2channel&#x27;s hosting provider, Nishimura no longer administrates 2channel, but instead operates a competitor to it, 2ch.sc.

== Career ==
Nishimura was born in Sagamihara, Kanagawa, but raised in Tokyo. He founded Tokyo Access LP in 1998. In May 1999, he opened 2channel while he was studying at the University of Central Arkansas. In June 2001, he founded Irregulars and Partners KK with Ichirō Yamamoto, which was involved in 2channel&#x27;s management, but later left.

He graduated with a degree in psychology from Chuo University in 2000.

In January 2007, Nishimura was an advisor to Skip-Up KK, CEO of Tokyo Plus KK, co-founder of KK, and a director of Niwango, the company that launched Nico Nico Douga. He left his role at Niwango in February 2013.

=== 2channel ===

During 2008, 2ch generated an annual revenue upwards of ¥100 million for Nishimura. The site was also run by 300 &quot;volunteer administrators&quot; who received no pay. Nishimura justified this with the comment, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s all that different from some dude who opens a convenience store in front of a train station. They can make a million yen a day.&quot;

In August 2013, an accidental leak placed the credit card details of thousands of 2channel users into the public domain, and this event resulted in a series of lawsuits against the website. Around the same time, the anti-matome movement took place throughout 2channel, a controversial community development involving users protesting against which specialize in summarizing 2channel threads, which were taking away site traffic.

On 19 February 2014, Jim Watkins, as chairman of N.T. Technology, Inc., 2channel&#x27;s domain registrar, seized 2channel&#x27;s domain. He took full control over the website, relieved Nishimura of all power, and assumed the role of website administrator. Watkins claimed that Nishimura had failed to pay him money owed which led to the seizure as a way to cover Nishimura&#x27;s debts, while Nishimura claimed that he had in fact paid everything owed and that the domain transfer was an illegal domain hijacking. In response, Nishimura created his own clone of 2channel at , scraping the contents of the entire 2channel website and updating 2ch.sc as new posts appeared on 2ch.net. In a Q&amp;A session on 4chan shortly after becoming the site&#x27;s owner, Nishimura claimed that 2channel was stolen by Watkins.

In October 2017, Watkins renamed 2channel to 5channel and transferred it to Loki Technology Inc. to avoid legal complications.

===4chan===
On 21 September 2015, he bought the website 4chan from Christopher Poole. The amount paid has not been disclosed, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; has reported that the sale was made possible with funds provided by three Japanese investors.

Users on 4chan refer to him commonly as &#x27;hiro&#x27; but also by the ethnic slur &quot;gook moot&quot;, or the nickname &quot;Jackie 4chan&quot;, &quot;Hiroshima Nagasaki,&quot; or simply &quot;hiroshimoot&quot;.

== Lawsuits ==
=== As defendant ===
Nishimura has lost a number of libel lawsuits which have led to him being assessed a considerable amount in penalties. In 2008, he told &quot;Wired&quot; he has no intention of paying, saying, &quot;If the verdict mandates deleting things, I&#x27;ll do it,&quot; but, &quot;I just haven&#x27;t complied with demands to pay money. Would a cell phone carrier feel responsible when somebody receives a threatening phone call?&quot;

=== As plaintiff ===
Nishimura has filed a number of lawsuits against Jim Watkins in connection with his allegation that 2channel was illegally seized. He has attempted to repossess the domain both through WIPO&#x27;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy and through the Japanese court system. Through the Japan Patent Office, Nishimura owns the trademark &quot;2channel&quot;, though the WIPO refused to intervene on his behalf on account of that, suggesting the parties go to court instead as it was not, in its view, a case of &quot;cybersquatting&quot; but rather a &quot;business dispute&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Nishimura is married. As of May 2019, he lives in Paris, to which he moved in 2015.

<doc id="217800" wikidata="Q630132" url="?curid=217800" title="Women in Love (film)">
<text>Women in Love is a 1969 British romantic drama film directed by Ken Russell and starring Alan Bates, Oliver Reed, Glenda Jackson, and Jennie Linden. The film was adapted by Larry Kramer from D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;Women in Love&quot;. It was the first film to be released by Brandywine Productions.

The plot follows the relationships between two sisters and two men in a mining town in post-World War I England. The two couples take markedly different directions. The film explores the nature of commitment and love.

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, with Jackson winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role, and the film receiving other honours.

==Plot==
The film takes place in 1920, in the Midlands mining town of Beldover. Two sisters, Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, discuss marriage on their way to the wedding of Laura Crich, daughter of the town&#x27;s wealthy mine owner, Thomas Crich, to Tibby Lupton, a naval officer. At the village&#x27;s church, each sister is fascinated by a particular member of the wedding party – Gudrun by Laura&#x27;s brother, Gerald, and Ursula by Gerald&#x27;s best friend, Rupert Birkin. Ursula is a school teacher and Rupert is a school inspector; she remembers his visit to her classroom, interrupting her botany lesson to discourse on the sexual nature of the catkin.

The four are later brought together at a house party at the estate of Hermione Roddice, a rich woman whose relationship with Rupert is falling apart. When Hermione devises, as entertainment for her guests, a dance in the &quot;style of the Russian ballet&quot;, Rupert becomes impatient with her pretensions and tells the pianist to play some ragtime. This sets off spontaneous dancing among the whole group which angers Hermione and makes her leave. When Rupert follows her into the next room, she smashes a glass paperweight against his head, and he staggers outside. He discards his clothes and wanders through the woods. Later, at the Criches&#x27; annual picnic, to which most of the town is invited, Ursula and Gudrun find a secluded spot, and Gudrun dances before some Highland cattle while Ursula sings &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot;. When Gerald and Rupert appear, Gerald calls Gudrun&#x27;s behaviour &quot;impossible and ridiculous&quot;, and then says he loves her. &quot;That&#x27;s one way of putting it&quot;, she replies. Ursula and Rupert wander away discussing death and love. They make love in the woods. The day ends in tragedy when Laura and Tibby drown while swimming in the lake.

During one of Gerald and Rupert&#x27;s discussions, Rupert suggests Japanese-style wrestling. They strip and wrestle in the firelight. Rupert enjoys their closeness and says they should swear to love each other, but Gerald cannot understand Rupert&#x27;s idea of wanting to have an emotional union with a man as well as an emotional and physical union with a woman. Ursula and Rupert decide to marry while Gudrun and Gerald continue to see each other. One evening, emotionally exhausted after his father&#x27;s illness and death, Gerald sneaks into the Brangwen house to spend the night with Gudrun in her bed, then leaves at dawn.

Later, after Ursula and Rupert&#x27;s marriage, Gerald suggests that the four of them go to the Alps for Christmas. At their inn in the Alps, Gudrun irritates Gerald with her interest in Loerke, a gay German sculptor. An artist herself, Gudrun is fascinated with Loerke&#x27;s idea that brutality is necessary to create art. While Gerald grows increasingly jealous and angry, Gudrun only derides and ridicules him. Finally, he can endure it no longer. After attempting to strangle her, he trudges off into the cold, to commit suicide and die alone. Rupert and Ursula return to their cottage in England. Rupert grieves for his dead friend. As Ursula and Rupert discuss love, Ursula says there can&#x27;t be two kinds of love. He explains that she is enough for love of a woman but there is another eternal love and bond for a man.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Larry Kramer was an American who moved to London in 1961 to work as an assistant story editor at Columbia and had become an assistant to David Picker at United Artists. United Artists wanted Kramer to move to New York but he wanted to live in London and produce, so he quit his job. He went to work on 1967&#x27;s &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot; as producer and ended up rewriting the script.

He was looking for another project when Silvio Narizzano, who had directed the successful &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (1966), suggested Kramer make a film of &quot;Women in Love&quot;. Kramer read the novel, loved it, and optioned the screen rights for $4,200. He wrote a screen treatment based on the chapters and succeeded in selling the project to David Chasman and David Picker at United Artists.

===Script===
Kramer originally commissioned a screenplay from David Mercer. Mercer&#x27;s adaptation differed too much from the original book and he was bought out of the project. &quot;It was a horrible Marxist tract,&quot; Kramer said. &quot;Just horrible. I had no script and no more money for another writer.

Ultimately, Kramer wrote the script, although he had not written one before. &quot;I became a writer not by choice but out of necessity,&quot; he said.

Kramer said &quot;slightly more than half the film&quot; was directly from the novel. He took the rest from various sources including Lawrence&#x27;s letters, essays, poems and plays.

&quot;I wanted to show you can convey emotion along with action and that ideas and talk and beautiful scenery are not incompatible in films,&quot; said Kramer. &quot;My first draft was all dialog, the second was mostly visual. The end result was a combination of both.&quot;

===Russell as director===
Narizzano, intended as director, left the project after suffering a series of personal setbacks. He divorced his wife for a man who died soon after. After Narizzano&#x27;s departure, Kramer considered a number of directors to take on the project, including Jack Clayton, Stanley Kubrick and Peter Brook, all of whom declined.

Ken Russell had previously directed only two films, and was better known for his biographical projects about artists for the BBC. His second film, &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; was admired by Chasman and Picker at UA, who told him &quot;they thought it got a raw deal from right wing critics and that I could do better with a more sympathetic subject.&quot; Chasman and Picker sent a copy of Kramer&#x27;s script to Russell, who liked it. The director read the novel, which he loved; he called &quot;Women in Love&quot; &quot;probably the best English novel ever written.&quot; He and Kramer collaborated on further drafts of the script, using information from Lawrence&#x27;s own life and adding extra bits from the novel. This included adding the nude wrestling scene. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t in the original script,&quot; wrote Russell. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it would pass the censor and I knew it would be difficult to shoot. I was wrong on my first guess and right on my second. Olly [Oliver Reed] talked me into it. He wrestled with me, jujitsu style, in my kitchen, and wouldn&#x27;t let me up until I said, &#x27;OK, OK, you win, I&#x27;ll do it.&#x27;&quot;

By the time United Artists approved the script, the project had a second producer, Martin Rosen.

===Casting===
Russell says casting was &quot;difficult&quot; in part because most of his television work was done with non-actors so he was &quot;totally out of touch to the real talent at hand.&quot;

Kramer had been talking to Alan Bates about playing Birkin for a number of years and he was cast relatively easily. Bates sported a beard, giving him a physical resemblance to D. H. Lawrence.

Michael Caine, who had just made &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; with Russell, says he was offered a lead role but turned it down because he felt unable to do the nude scene.

Kramer wanted Edward Fox for the role of Gerald. Fox fitted Lawrence&#x27;s description of the character (&quot;blond, glacial and Nordic&quot;), but United Artists, the studio financing the production, imposed Oliver Reed, a more bankable star, as Gerald even though he was not physically like Lawrence&#x27;s description of the character. Russell had worked with Reed before and said even though the actor &quot;wasn&#x27;t ideal physically for the part he couldn&#x27;t have played it better.&quot;

Kramer was adamant to give the role of Gudrun to Glenda Jackson. She was, then, well recognised in theatrical circles. As a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company she had gained a great deal of attention as Charlotte Corday in &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;. United Artists was unconvinced, considering her not conventionally beautiful enough for the role of Gudrun, who drives Gerald to suicide. Russell was unimpressed when he met Jackson and says only in seeing &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; &quot;did I realise what a magnificent screen personality she is.&quot;

The last of the four main roles to be cast was that of Ursula. Both Vanessa Redgrave and Faye Dunaway declined to take the role, finding it the less interesting of the two sisters and that they would be easily eclipsed by Glenda Jackson&#x27;s acting skills. It was by accident that Russell and Kramer came upon a screen test that Jennie Linden had made opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole for &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;, for a part she did not get. Linden had recently given birth to her only son and was not eager to take the role but was persuaded by Kramer and Russell.

Bates and Reed received a percentage of the profits while Linden and Jackson were paid a straight salary.

The composer Michael Garrett, who also contributed to the score, can be seen playing the piano in one scene.

===Shooting===
Filming started 25 September 1968 and took place in northern England and Switzerland. The opening scene with credits was shot at what is now Crich Tramway Museum in Derbyshire. It took sixteen weeks and was budgeted at $1.65 million but came in at $1.5 million &quot;because everyone was helpful,&quot; says Kramer, including key participants taking a percentage. Jackson was pregnant during filming.

The film features a famous nude wrestling scene between Bates and Reed. Kramer says Reed turned up to the shoot drunk and got Bates drunk. &quot;I had to get drunk before I exposed myself on camera,&quot; said Reed.

The wrestling scene caused the film to be banned altogether in Turkey.

Russell said he regretted omitting a scene where the sisters went to London &quot;where they sample la vie boheme. It helped form their characters and explains their subsequent behaviour. At least two of the actors were miscast while another had to be replaced after his second appearance. But none of that matters when a movie turns you on. You can have brilliant camerawork, great editing, a fine script and good acting, but it don&#x27;t mean a thing if it ain&#x27;t got that swing.&quot;

===Russell&#x27;s view of the film===
Russell later wrote &quot;I&#x27;ve made better films than &quot;Women in Love&quot; but obviously it had something that tickled the public&#x27;s fancy, and it wasn&#x27;t just the male members of Messrs Bates and Reed. It might have probed intimacy between the sexes as few movies had before, but I can take scant credit for that. I was only putting on the screen what D. H. Lawrence had written half a century before. But the film did have some excellent performances...and both Alan and Olly really came to grips with the subject, especially in the nude wrestling scene.&quot;

==Release==
===Censorship===
The film was passed uncut by the British censor.

===Box office===
The film was one of the eight most popular films at the British box office in 1970. As it cost $1.6 million, it recouped its costs in England alone. It made $3.0 million in rentals in the U.S. and Canada and made $4.5 million worldwide.

===Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;It is hard to imagine what a completely faithful translation of Lawrence would look like, or even if it would be at all watchable. &quot;Women in Love&quot; has peopled an authentic landscape with the right faces and a &#x27;crowded canvas&#x27; of detail in the hope that the author&#x27;s vision will inevitably shine through. The result is no more or less successful than the rather different approach to the smaller task of adaptation in &quot;The Fox&quot;. On the strength of it, &quot;Women in Love&quot; probably deserves as kind a reception as &quot;The Fox&quot; and is certainly more enjoyable than Joseph Strick&#x27;s aesthetically grinding and all too willed adaptation of selections from &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Women in Love&quot; currently holds an 83% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10. Film critic Emanuel Levy has said of the film: &quot;Though deviating from D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel considerably, this is Ken Russell&#x27;s most fully-realised narrative film, lavishly mounted and well-acted, especially by Glenda Jackson in an Oscar-winning performance.&quot;

<doc id="217807" wikidata="Q5110151" url="?curid=217807" title="Christian Social Union (UK)">
<text>The Christian Social Union (CSU) was an organisation associated with the Church of England, with some similar features to the Social Gospel movement of North America. The group was established in 1889 and dedicated itself to the study of contemporary social conditions and the remedying of poverty and other forms of social injustice through public mobilisation to alleviate the same. The organisation was terminated by merger in 1919, becoming part of the Industrial Christian Fellowship (ICF).

==Establishment==
The Archbishop of Canterbury Edward Benson helped set the stage for the Christian Social Union. In his &quot;Christ and His Times&quot; (1886), Benson had written that &quot;there is much in &#x27;socialism,&#x27; as we now understand it, which honestly searches for some beneficial remedy—much of which is purely religious and Christian.&quot; Furthermore, Benson said that all clergy should have &quot;some knowledge&quot; of socialism and that they should &quot;prepare and suggest and promote the wisest social measures.&quot;

In the spirit of the archbishop&#x27;s admonitions, in 1889, Henry Scott Holland, Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford called together a group, which evolved into the Christian Social Union.

From that meeting, the Christian Social Union (CSU) was established at Oxford, England, on 16 November 1889. Within a year, it had 77 members. A London branch of the organisation was established the next year. It had 124 members in 1891.

Its rules were that it would consist of &quot;members of the Church of England&quot; who agreed:

#To claim for the Christian law the ultimate authority to rule social practice.
#To study in common how to apply the moral truths and principles of Christianity to the social and economic problems of the present time. 
#To present Christ in practical life as the Living Master and King, the enemy of wrong and selfishness, the power of righteousness and love.
The group&#x27;s origins lay in the writings of Frederick Denison Maurice (once a professor of theology at King&#x27;s College London), Charles Kingsley, and John Malcolm Forbes Ludlow.

It avoided &quot;hard and fast lines&quot;, allowing differing parties to work together in different ways in the same organisation. The Oxford and London branches of the CSU had very different orientations. The Oxford branch was concerned mostly with the accumulation and analysis of economic facts, with a view to helping to understand the nature and magnitude of contemporary social problems and developing potential solutions for such issues.

The London branch, on the other hand, was more oriented towards mobilisation efforts, organising public meetings and providing series of sermons and public lectures to Church of England congregations as well as a broader public.

While many of its aims were comparable to those of the social gospel movement in the USA and Canada, the CSU was less directly aligned with forms of theological liberalism, and included both liberal and Anglo-Catholic leaders. One of the organisation&#x27;s early pamphlets declared:
We start from the conviction ... that the time is come to vote urgency for the social question. We believe that political problems are rapidly giving place to the industrial problem, which is proving itself more and more to be the question of the hour ...
We are of those who are convinced that the ultimate solution of this social question is bound to be discovered in the person and life of Christ.

==Development==
From its origins in Oxford and London, the CSU spread throughout the United Kingdom, with about 60 branches established by the middle of the first decade of the 20th century. The organisation then claimed a membership of about 5000. Particularly active branches were established in Cambridge, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, and Leicester.

Two publications were associated with the group, &quot;The Economic Review&quot;, published at Oxford, and &quot;The Commonwealth&quot;, published in London.

The CSU became attached to the Oxford Movement through the work of slum priests.

Its leaders included Henry Scott Holland, Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, and, briefly William Temple, later Archbishop of Canterbury from 1942 to 1944.

==Termination and legacy==
Its last annual report showed thirty-five branches and with a total membership &quot;well over 4,000&quot;.

The Christian Social Union merged in 1919 with the Navvy Mission Society to form the Industrial Christian Fellowship, which continues to develop issues of social justice, business ethics, etc.

The British CSU was the inspiration for a similar organisation in the United States, also known as the Christian Social Union, as well as affiliated organisations in New Zealand and Australia.

<doc id="217809" wikidata="Q242717" url="?curid=217809" title="Jane Alexander">
<text>Jane Alexander (née Quigley; born October 28, 1939) is an American-Canadian actress and author. She is the recipient of two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, and nominations for four Academy Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards. From 1993 to 1997, Alexander served as the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts.

Alexander won the 1969 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in the Broadway production of &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;. Other Broadway credits include &quot;6 Rms Riv Vu&quot; (1972), &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1988), &quot;The Sisters Rosensweig&quot; (1993) and &quot;Honour&quot; (1998). She has received a total of eight Tony Award nominations and was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1994.

Her film breakthrough came with the romantic drama &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; (1970), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her subsequent Oscar nominations were for her roles in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979), and &quot;Testament&quot; (1983). An eight-time Emmy nominee, she received her first nomination for playing Eleanor Roosevelt in &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot; (1976), a role that required her to age from 18 to 60. She has won two Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;Playing for Time&quot; (1980) and &quot;Warm Springs&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Alexander was born Jane Quigley in Boston, Massachusetts, daughter of Ruth Elizabeth (née Pearson), a nurse, and Thomas B. Quigley, an orthopaedic surgeon. She graduated from Beaver Country Day School, an all-girls school in Chestnut Hill outside of Boston, where she discovered her love of acting.

Encouraged by her father to go to college before embarking on an acting career, Alexander attended Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, where she concentrated on theater but also studied mathematics with an eye toward computer programming in the event that she failed as an actress. Also while at Sarah Lawrence, she shared an apartment with Hope Cooke, who would become Queen Consort of the last king of Sikkim. Alexander spent her junior year studying at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland where she participated in the Edinburgh University Dramatic Society. The experience solidified her determination to continue acting.

==Career==
Alexander made her Broadway debut in 1963, replacing Phyllis Wynn as Sandy Dennis&#x27; standby in &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;. She reportedly performed the role a handful of times. Alexander&#x27;s major break in acting came in 1967 when she played Eleanor Backman in the original production of Howard Sackler&#x27;s &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; at Arena Stage in Washington, DC. Like her co-star, James Earl Jones, she went on to play the part both on Broadway (1968), winning a Tony Award for her performance, and in the film version (1970), which earned her an Oscar nomination. Alexander&#x27;s additional screen credits include &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979), and &quot;Testament&quot; (1983), all of which earned her Oscar nods, &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1999), and &quot;Fur&quot; (2006), in which she played Gertrude Nemerov, mother of Diane Arbus, played in the film by Nicole Kidman.

The play &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; was revived on March 17, 1972, at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles with Alexander, Henry Fonda, Gloria Grahame, Lewis J. Stadlen, Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Thompson, Strother Martin, Richard X. Slattery, and Pepper Martin among the cast with Edwin Sherin directing.

Alexander portrayed Eleanor Roosevelt in two television productions, &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot; (1976) and &quot;Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years&quot; (1977); she also played FDR&#x27;s mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Warm Springs&quot; (2005) with Kenneth Branagh and Cynthia Nixon, a role which garnered her an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Alexander co-starred with Rachel Roberts in Steven Gether&#x27;s teleplay and production of &quot;A Circle of Children&quot; (1977), based on Mary MacCracken&#x27;s autobiographical book about emotionally disturbed children (with an emphasis on autism), which won Gether an Emmy. Alexander also starred in its sequel, &quot;Lovey: A Circle of Children, Part II&quot; (1978).

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Alexander&#x27;s name and picture.

Alexander&#x27;s other television films include Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Playing for Time&quot;, co-starring Vanessa Redgrave, for which Alexander won another Emmy Award; &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; (as famed gossip-monger Hedda Hopper); &quot;Blood &amp; Orchids&quot;; and &quot;In Love and War&quot; (1987) co-starring James Woods, which tells the story of James and Sybil Stockdale during Stockdale&#x27;s eight years as a US prisoner of war in Vietnam. Alexander also played the protagonist, Dr. May Foster, in the HBO drama series &quot;Tell Me You Love Me&quot;. Her character, a psychotherapist, serves as the connecting link between three couples coping with relational and sexual difficulties. The show&#x27;s frank portrayal of &quot;senior&quot; sexuality and explicit sex scenes generated controversy, although it won a rare endorsement by the AARP. She also had a minor role as Dr. Graznik in &quot;The Ring&quot;.
In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed Alexander chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts, the organization that had provided partial funding for &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; at Arena Stage. Alexander moved to Washington, DC, and served as chair of the NEA until 1997. Her book, &quot;Command Performance: an Actress in the Theater of Politics&quot; (2000), describes the challenges she faced heading the NEA at a time when the 104th U.S. Congress, headed by Newt Gingrich, unsuccessfully strove to shut it down. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999.

In 2004, Alexander, together with her husband, Edwin Sherin, joined the theater faculty at Florida State University. She serves on various boards, including the Wildlife Conservation Society, the National Audubon Society, Project Greenhope, the National Stroke Association, and Women&#x27;s Action for Nuclear Disarmament, and she has received the Israel Cultural Award and the Helen Caldicott Leadership Award. Alexander is also a fellow of the International Leadership Forum. In 2009 Alexander starred in Thom Thomas&#x27;s play &quot;A Moon to Dance By&quot; at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It was directed by her husband, Edwin Sherin.

==Personal life==
Alexander met her first husband, Robert Alexander, in the early 1960s in New York City, where both were pursuing acting careers. They had one son, Jace Alexander, in 1964, and the couple divorced a decade later. Alexander had been acting regularly in various regional theaters when she met producer/director Edwin Sherin in Washington, DC, where he was artistic director at Arena Stage. Alexander starred in the original theatrical production of &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; under Sherin&#x27;s direction at Arena Stage prior to the play&#x27;s Broadway debut. The two became good friends and, once divorced from their respective spouses, became romantically involved, marrying in 1975. Between the two, they have four children, Alexander&#x27;s son Jace and Sherin&#x27;s three sons, Tony, Geoffrey, and Jon. She and Sherin became Canadian citizens, having maintained a home in Lockeport, Nova Scotia starting in 1998. Edwin Sherin died at the age of 87, in Nova Scotia, on May 4, 2017.

<text>Messier 13, or M13 (also designated NGC 6205 and sometimes called the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, the Hercules Globular Cluster, or the Great Hercules Cluster), is a globular cluster of several hundred thousand stars in the constellation of Hercules.

==Discovery and visibility==
Messier 13 was discovered by Edmond Halley in 1714, and cataloged by Charles Messier on June 1, 1764, into his list of objects not to mistake for comets; Messier&#x27;s list, including Messier 13, eventually became known as the Messier catalog. It is located at right ascension 16h 41.7m, declination +36° 28&#x27;. Messier 13 is often described by astronomers as the most magnificent globular cluster visible to northern observers.

About one third of the way from Vega to Arcturus, four bright stars in Hercules form the Keystone asterism, the broad torso of the hero. M13 can be seen in this asterism of the way north (by west) from Zeta to Eta Herculis. With an apparent magnitude of 5.8, Messier 13 may be visible to the naked eye with averted vision on dark nights. Messier 13 is prominent in traditional binoculars as a bright, round patch of light. Its diameter is about 23 arcminutes and it is readily viewable in small telescopes. At least four inches of telescope aperture resolves stars in Messier 13&#x27;s outer extent as small pinpoints of light. However, only larger telescopes resolve stars further into the center of the cluster. The cluster is visible throughout the year from latitudes greater than 36 degrees north, with the longest visibility during Northern Hemisphere spring and summer.
Nearby to Messier 13 is NGC 6207, a 12th-magnitude edge-on galaxy that lies 28 arcminutes directly northeast. A small galaxy, IC 4617, lies halfway between NGC 6207 and M13, north-northeast of the large globular cluster&#x27;s center. At low powers the cluster is bracketed by two seventh-magnitude stars.

==Characteristics==
About 145 light-years in diameter, M13 is composed of several hundred thousand stars, with estimates varying from around 300,000 to over half a million. The brightest star in the cluster is a red giant, the variable star V11, also known as V1554 Herculis, with an apparent visual magnitude of 11.95. M13 is 22,200 to 25,000 light-years away from Earth, and the globular cluster is one of over one hundred that orbit the center of the Milky Way.

The stars in this cluster are firmly in the Population II category, markedly lower in metals than Population I stars like the Sun and most other stars in the Sun&#x27;s close proximity. M13 as a whole has only about 4.6% as much iron as the Sun does.

Single stars in this globular cluster were first resolved in 1779. Compared to the stars in the neighborhood of the Sun, the stars of the M13 population are more than a hundred times more densely packed. They are so close together that they sometimes collide and produce new stars. The newly formed, young stars, known as &quot;blue stragglers&quot;, are particularly interesting to astronomers.

The last three variables (V63, V64 and V65) were discovered from Spain in April 2021, March 2022 and January 2024, respectively.

==Arecibo message==

The 1974 Arecibo message, which contained encoded information about the human race, DNA, atomic numbers, Earth&#x27;s position and other information, was beamed from the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope towards Messier 13 as an experiment in contacting potential extraterrestrial civilizations in the cluster. M13 was chosen because it was a large, relatively close star cluster that was available at the time and place of the ceremony. The cluster will move through space during the transit time; opinions differ as to whether or not the cluster will be in a position to receive the message by the time that it arrives.

==Literary references==
* The science fiction novellas &quot;Sucker Bait&quot; by Isaac Asimov and the novel &quot;Question and Answer&quot; by Poul Anderson take place on Troas, a world within M13.
* In the German science fiction series &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot;, M13 is the location of Arkon, the homeworld of the race of Arkonides.
* In author Dan Simmons&#x27; &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot; the Hercules cluster is where a copy of Earth was secretly recreated after the original was destroyed.
* In his novel &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, Kurt Vonnegut writes &quot;Every passing hour brings the Solar System forty-three thousand miles closer to Globular Cluster M13 in Hercules—and still there are some misfits who insist that there is no such thing as progress.&quot;
* Messier 13 is the home of the antagonistic aliens in the 1977 space opera &quot;The War in Space&quot;, who hail from the third planet of a system orbiting a star called Yomi.
* Deliberately engineering a star in Messier 13 to go nova was part of the Cybermen&#x27;s complicated plot in the 1968 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;.

<text>Elizabeth Alice MacGraw (born April 1, 1939) is an American actress. She first gained attention with her role in &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer. She then starred in &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 1972, MacGraw was voted the top female box office star in the world and was honored with a hands and footprints ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre after having made just three films. She went on to star in &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), &quot;Players&quot; (1979), &quot;Just Tell Me What You Want&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983). In 1991, she published an autobiography, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;.

==Early life==
MacGraw was born in Pound Ridge, New York, the daughter of commercial artists Frances (&quot;née&quot; Klein) and Richard MacGraw. She has one brother, Dick, an artist. Her mother was Hungarian Jewish, the daughter of emigrants from Budapest, Hungary. MacGraw&#x27;s mother chose not to disclose her ancestry to Ali&#x27;s father, instead professing ignorance about it. &quot;I think Daddy was bigoted,&quot; MacGraw has said.

Her mother was considered a &quot;pioneer&quot; as an artist, who had taught in Paris before settling in Greenwich Village. Her parents married when her mother was nearing 35: &quot;My gorgeous father: a combination of Tyrone Power and a mystery, a brilliant artist and a brain beyond brains.&quot; He was born in New Jersey with his childhood spent in an orphanage. He ran away to sea when he was 16 and studied art in Munich. MacGraw adds, &quot;Daddy was frightened and really, really angry. He never forgave his real parents for giving him up.&quot; As an adult, he constantly suppressed the rage he built up against his parents. She described her father as &quot;violent&quot;.

MacGraw attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Connecticut and graduated from Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts in 1960.

==Career==

===Early career===
Beginning in 1960, MacGraw spent six years working at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine as a photographic assistant to fashion maven Diana Vreeland. She worked at &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine as a fashion model and as a photographer&#x27;s stylist. She has also worked as an interior designer.

===Film and television===

MacGraw began her acting career in television commercials, including one for the Polaroid Swinger camera. In one commercial for International Paper, she was on a beach in a bikini made of Confil and went for a swim underwater to prove its strength and durability. MacGraw gained widespread attention with &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969), her first leading role, but real stardom came when she starred opposite Ryan O&#x27;Neal in &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), one of the highest-grossing films in U.S. history. The film, and MacGraw&#x27;s performance in particular, received widespread critical acclaim, and earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, in addition to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Following &quot;Love Story&quot;, MacGraw was celebrated on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. 
In 1972, after appearing in just three films, she had her footprints and autograph engraved at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. She then starred opposite Steve McQueen in &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), which was one of the year&#x27;s top ten films at the box office. Having taken a five-year break from acting, in 1978 MacGraw re-emerged in another box office hit, &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), opposite Kris Kristofferson. She then appeared in the films &quot;Players&quot; (1979) and &quot;Just Tell Me What You Want&quot; (1980), directed by Sidney Lumet.

In 1983, MacGraw starred in the highly successful television miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;. In 1985, MacGraw joined hit ABC prime-time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Lady Ashley Mitchell, which, she admitted in a 2011 interview, she did for the money. She appeared in 14 episodes of the show before her character was killed off in the &quot;Moldavian Massacre&quot; cliffhanger episode in 1985.
She also hosted segments for the Encore Love Stories premium cable network in the late 1990s and 2000s.

In February 2021, MacGraw and O&#x27;Neal were honored with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, 50 years after the release of &quot;Love Story&quot;.

===Stage===
MacGraw made her Broadway theater debut in New York City in 2006 as a dysfunctional matriarch in the drama &quot;Festen&quot; (&quot;The Celebration&quot;).

In 2016, MacGraw reunited with Ryan O&#x27;Neal in a staging of A.R. Gurney&#x27;s play &quot;Love Letters&quot;, which toured the US and UK through 2017.

===Magazine recognition===
In 1991, &quot;People&quot; magazine selected MacGraw as one of its &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; in the World.

In 2008, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine listed her in their &quot;Sexiest 25 Women in Film Ever&quot; edition.

===Yoga===
Having become a Hatha Yoga devotee in her early 50s, MacGraw produced a yoga video with the American Yoga Master Erich Schiffmann, &quot;Ali MacGraw Yoga Mind and Body&quot;. The impact of this bestselling video was such that in June 2007, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine credited MacGraw with being one of the people responsible for the practice&#x27;s recent popularity in the United States.

==Animal welfare==
In July 2006, MacGraw filmed a public service announcement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), urging residents to take their pets with them in the event of wildfires. In 2008, she wrote the foreword to the book &quot;Pawprints of Katrina&quot; by author Cathy Scott and photography by Clay Myers about Best Friends Animal Society and the largest pet rescue in U.S. history. MacGraw is also a U.S. Ambassador for animal welfare charity Animals Asia. She has been a life long lover of Scottish Terriers, now having her sixth. An animal welfare advocate throughout her life, she received the Humane Education Award by Animal Protection of New Mexico for speaking out about animal issues.

==Personal life==
While in college, MacGraw met German Canadian Robert &quot;Robin&quot; Martin Hoen, a Harvard-educated banker, and the couple married on October 29, 1960. They divorced in July 1962. Hoen died on September 13, 2016.

Following her first divorce, MacGraw had a string of relationships and one abortion; the procedure was still illegal at the time. In 1979, MacGraw&#x27;s mother, who was 38 when she gave birth to her, revealed that she had an abortion of her own in the early 1920s.
On October 24, 1969, MacGraw married film producer Robert Evans. Their son, Josh Evans, is an actor, director, producer and screenwriter. They separated in 1972 after she became involved in a public affair with Steve McQueen on the set of &quot;The Getaway&quot;. MacGraw&#x27;s divorce from Evans was finalized on June 7, 1973, and on July 12, she married McQueen in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They divorced in August 1978.

In the nearly half-century since her divorce from McQueen, MacGraw has never remarried. She dated Warren Beatty, Rick Danko, Bill Hudson, Ronald Meyer, Rod Stryker, Fran Tarkenton, Peter Weller, Henry Wolf and Mickey Raphael.

MacGraw&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, revealed her struggles with alcohol and sex addiction. She was treated for the former at the Betty Ford Center.

When ex-husband Evans received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2002, she accompanied him. Their grandson Jackson was born in December 2010 to Josh and his wife, singer Roxy Saint. After Evans&#x27; 2019 death, MacGraw told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;Our son, Joshua, and I will miss Bob tremendously, and we are so very proud of his enormous contribution to the film industry.&quot; Evans told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2010 that during the last four decades of his life, MacGraw had been a close friend of his despite their divorce.

MacGraw has lived in Tesuque, New Mexico, since 1994, after the house she rented in Malibu was destroyed by a fire. She was originally intended to make a cameo as herself in the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; episode &quot;Grey Matter&quot; as a guest at the birthday party of character Elliott Schwartz, set in Santa Fe, but her appearance did not make the final cut of the episode.

<doc id="217819" wikidata="Q1423795" url="?curid=217819" title="Ryan's Daughter">
<text>Ryan&#x27;s Daughter is a 1970 British epic romantic drama film directed by David Lean, written by Robert Bolt and starring Robert Mitchum and Sarah Miles. The film, set between August 1917 and January 1918, tells the story of a married Irish woman who has an affair with a British officer during World War I, despite moral and political opposition from her nationalist neighbours. The supporting cast features John Mills, Christopher Jones, Trevor Howard and Leo McKern. The film is a re-telling of the plot of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s 1857 novel &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;.

The score was written by Maurice Jarre and the movie was photographed in Super Panavision 70 by Freddie Young. In its initial release, &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was harshly received by critics but was a box office success, grossing nearly $31 million on a budget of $13.3 million, making the film the eighth-highest-grossing picture of 1970. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and won in two categories.

==Plot==

In August 1917, Rosy Ryan, only daughter of the local publican, widower Thomas Ryan, is bored with life in Kirrary, an isolated village on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry in the south-west of Ireland. The villagers are Irish nationalists, taunting British soldiers from a nearby army camp. Tom Ryan publicly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, but secretly serves the British as an informer. Rosy falls in love with the village schoolmaster, widower Charles Shaughnessy. She imagines, though he tries to convince her otherwise, that he will somehow add excitement to her life. They marry and settle in the schoolhouse, but he is a quiet man uninterested in physical love.

Major Randolph Doryan arrives in October 1917 to take command of the army camp. After winning a Victoria Cross on the Western Front, he has a crippled leg and is suffering from shell shock. When he visits the pub where Rosy is serving alone, he collapses under a flashback to the trenches and is comforted by her. The two kiss passionately until they are interrupted by the arrival of Ryan and others. Next day, the two ride to a forest for a passionate liaison and make love for the first time. Charles becomes suspicious of Rosy, but keeps his thoughts to himself.

Charles takes his schoolchildren to the beach, where he notices Doryan&#x27;s telltale footprints accompanied by a woman&#x27;s in the sand. He tracks the prints to a cave and imagines Doryan and Rosy conducting an affair. Local halfwit Michael notices the footprints as well and searches the cave, finding Major Doryan&#x27;s Victoria Cross. He pins it on his lapel and proudly parades through the village, but suffers abuse from the villagers. When Rosy comes riding past, Michael approaches her tenderly. Between Rosy&#x27;s dismay and Michael&#x27;s pantomime, the villagers surmise that she is having an affair with Doryan.

One night in January 1918, during a fierce storm, IRB leader Tim O&#x27;Leary and a small band of his men arrive in Ryan&#x27;s pub seeking help to recover a shipment of German arms being floated from a ship towards the beach. When they leave, Ryan tips off the British. The entire village turns out to help the rebels, with Ryan the most outwardly devoted to the task, wading into the breakers repeatedly to salvage boxes of weapons and explosives. O&#x27;Leary is overwhelmed by Ryan&#x27;s devotion, and the villagers are ebullient. They gleefully free the rebels&#x27; loaded truck from the wet sand and follow it up the hill. Doryan, waiting at the top with his troops, captures the men and arms. O&#x27;Leary tries to flee, but Doryan climbs atop the truck and brings him down with a single rifle shot. Then he suffers a flashback and collapses. Rosy presses through the crowd in concern, outraging the villagers.

Charles tells Rosy that he had let her affair run its course, hoping that the infatuation would pass, but now wants a separation. Rosy says the affair is over, but that night she leaves their bed in her nightdress to meet Doryan. In dismay, Charles wanders in his nightclothes to the beach, where the parish priest Father Collins finds him. The villagers, led by Mr. McCardle, storm into the schoolhouse and seize Rosy, convinced that she informed the British of the arms shipment. Thomas watches in shame and horror as the mob humiliated her by stripping her clothes off and Mrs. McCardle shearing her hair until Father Collins intervenes.

Doryan walks along the beach and gives his cigarette case to Michael. In gratitude, Michael leads Doryan to a cache of arms, including dynamite, that was not recovered. After Michael runs off, Doryan commits suicide by detonating the explosives. The next day, Rosy and Charles leave for Dublin, which Father Collins and Michael help carry their luggage to the bus stop. Before they leave, Father Collins says to Charles that his only doubt is the same as Charles&#x27;s: if he and Rosy should separate.
==Cast==
==Production==

The production was largely filmed on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland, in the spring and summer of 1969. However, due to poor weather, many of the beach scenes were filmed at Arniston in South Africa, easily identified by the nearby beach&#x27;s white sand. The shipwreck where Doryan detonates the explosives is that of the Kakapo which can be found just south of Cape Town.

===Development===

Robert Bolt&#x27;s original idea was to make a film of &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, starring Miles. Lean read the script and said that he did not find it interesting, but suggested to Bolt that he would like to rework it into another setting. The film still retains parallels with Flaubert&#x27;s novel – Rosy parallels Emma Bovary, Charles is her husband, and Major Doryan is analogous to Rodolphe and Leon, Emma&#x27;s lovers.

===Casting===

Alec Guinness turned down the role of Father Collins; it had been written with him in mind, but Guinness, a Roman Catholic convert, objected to what he felt was an inaccurate portrayal of a Catholic priest. His conflicts with Lean while making &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; also contributed. Paul Scofield was Lean&#x27;s first choice for the part of Shaughnessy, but he was unable to leave a theatre commitment. George C. Scott, Anthony Hopkins, and Patrick McGoohan were considered but not approached, and Gregory Peck lobbied for the role but gave up after Robert Mitchum was approached.

Reportedly, Mitchum initially was reluctant to take the role. While he admired the script, he was undergoing a personal crisis at the time and when pressed by Lean as to why he would not be available for filming, told him: &quot;I was actually planning on committing suicide.&quot; Upon hearing of this, scriptwriter Bolt told him, &quot;Well, if you just finish working on this wretched little film and then do yourself in, I&#x27;d be happy to stand the expenses of your burial.&quot;

The role of Major Doryan was written for Marlon Brando, who initially accepted, but problems with the production of &quot;Burn!&quot; forced him to drop out. Peter O&#x27;Toole, Richard Harris and Richard Burton also were considered. Lean then saw Christopher Jones in &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot; (1969) and decided he had to have Jones for the part, and so cast him without ever meeting him. He thought Jones had that rare Brando/Dean quality he wanted on film.

===Filming===
Lean had to wait a year before a suitably dramatic storm appeared. The image was kept clear of spray by a glass disk spinning in front of the lens, known as a Clear View screen.

Mitchum clashed with Lean, saying that &quot;Working with David Lean is like constructing the Taj Mahal out of toothpicks&quot;; despite this, Mitchum confided to friends and family that he felt &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was among his best roles and he regretted the negative response the film received. In a radio interview, Mitchum said that, despite the difficult production, Lean was one of the best directors he had worked with.

Jones claimed to have had an affair with Sharon Tate, who was killed by Charles Manson and his followers during filming, which devastated Jones. Miles and Jones also grew to dislike one another, leading to trouble when filming the love scenes. Jones was engaged to Olivia Hussey, and he was not attracted to Miles. He even refused to do the forest love scene with her, which prompted Miles to conspire with Mitchum. It was Mitchum who settled on the idea of drugging Jones by sprinkling an unspecified substance on his cereal. Mitchum overdosed Jones, however, and the actor was nearly catatonic during the love scene.

Jones and Lean clashed frequently. Due to Jones&#x27;s inability to do a convincing British accent and because Lean thought that Jones&#x27;s voice was too flat to be compelling, he decided to have all of Jones&#x27;s lines overdubbed by &quot;Carry On&quot; actor Julian Holloway. Lean was not alone in his disappointment with the actor; Jones&#x27;s retirement from acting was purportedly due to the bad reviews he received for &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

The film was more than 185 days over schedule.

==Release==
===MPAA Rating===
The Motion Picture Association of America originally gave &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; an &quot;R&quot; rating. A nude scene between Miles and Jones, as well as its themes involving infidelity, were the primary reasons for the decision. At the time, MGM was having financial trouble and appealed the rating not due to artistic but financial reasons.

At the appeal hearing, MGM executives explained that they needed the less restrictive rating to allow more audience into the theatres; otherwise the company would not be able to survive financially. The appeal was granted and the film received a &quot;GP&quot; rating, which later became &quot;PG&quot;. American political adviser Jack Valenti considered this to be one of the tarnishing marks on the rating system. When MGM resubmitted the film to the MPAA in 1996, it was re-rated &quot;R.&quot;

In Australia and New Zealand, the film was initially rated PG, but is currently rated M.

===Theatrical release===
&quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on 9 November 1970 and grossed $50,050 in its opening week.

After two months of release, it had grossed over $2 million worldwide.

===Reception===
Upon its initial release, &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; received a hostile reception from many film reviewers. Roger Ebert gave it two stars out of four and wrote that &quot;Lean&#x27;s characters, well written and well acted, are finally dwarfed by his excessive scale.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the screenplay &quot;the kind of book-club fiction that should be read under a hair-dryer, a fact that cannot be disguised by the elaborate production (Mr. Lean built his own, brand-new Irish village for the film) and the almost metaphysical style.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;brilliant enigma, brilliant, because David Lean achieved to a marked degree the daring and obvious goal of intimate romantic tragedy along the rugged geographical and political landscape of 1916 Ireland; an enigma, because overlength of perhaps 30 minutes serves to magnify some weaknesses of Robert Bolt&#x27;s original screenplay, to dissipate the impact of the performances, and to overwhelm outstanding photography and production.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Poor casting, heavy-handed direction that becomes comical during the big love scene and empty-headed characters make David Lean&#x27;s &#x27;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; an epic disappointment.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The original love story which Robert Bolt has set in these desolate seascapes seems both too frail and too banal to sustain the crushing weight of 3 hours and 18 minutes of Super Panavision.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;There is no artistic or moral rationale for this movie—only expediency ... The emptiness of &#x27;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; shows in practically every frame.&quot; According to James Wolcott, at a gathering of the National Society of Film Critics, &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Schickel asked Lean &quot;how someone who made &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; could make a piece of bullshit like &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter.&quot;&quot;

Some attribute the negative reviews to critics&#x27; expectations being too high, following the three epics Lean had directed in a row before &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The preview cut ran for over 220 minutes and was criticised for its length and poor pacing. Lean felt obliged to remove up to 17 minutes of footage before the film&#x27;s wide release. The missing footage has not been restored or located. Lean took these criticisms very personally, claiming at the time that he would never make another film. (Others dispute this, citing the fact that Lean tried but was unable to get several projects off the ground, including &quot;The Bounty&quot;.) The film was moderately successful worldwide at the box office and was one of the most successful films of 1970 in Britain, where it ran at a West End cinema for almost two years straight.

The film was also criticised for its perceived depiction of the Irish proletariat as uncivilised. An Irish commentator in 2008 called them &quot;the local herd-like and libidinous populace who lack gainful employment to keep them occupied&quot;. Some criticised the film as an attempt to negate the legacy of the 1916 Easter Rising and the subsequent Irish War of Independence in relation to the eruption of &quot;the Troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland around the time of the film&#x27;s release.

Since the film&#x27;s release on DVD, &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; has retained its reputation as one of Lean&#x27;s weakest films, critics finding it &quot;overlong&quot; (&quot;Variety&quot;), &quot;a weary Madame Bovary rehash&quot; (&quot;The Times&quot;) and &quot;a lush and overblown self-indulgence in which David Lean has given us a great deal less than meets the eye&quot; (Roger Ebert). Other elements, like John Mills&#x27; caricature of &quot;the village idiot&quot; (an Oscar-winning performance), have been met with ambivalence. A 2020 review of an account of the film&#x27;s production, &quot;Making Ryan’s Daughter: The Myths, Madness and Mastery&quot; in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; characterises its extravagances and personality clashes in much the same way as critics of the film itself, &quot;a fascinating but ultimately indulgent and doomed enterprise.&quot;

<text>Caroline Louise Snodgress (October 27, 1945 – April 1, 2004) was an American actress. She is best remembered for her role in the film &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot; (1970), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award as well as winning two Golden Globes and two Laurel Awards.

==Life and career==
Born in Barrington, Illinois, Snodgress attended Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge, then Northern Illinois University before leaving to pursue acting. She trained for the stage at the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (later DePaul University). After some minor TV appearances, she made her film debut in an uncredited appearance in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; in 1969, followed by a credit in 1970 for &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot;. Her next film, &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot; (1970), earned her a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actress and two Golden Globe wins, as Best Actress in a Comedy or a Musical and New Star of the Year – Actress.

She quit acting soon after to live with musician Neil Young and care for their son Zeke, who was born with cerebral palsy. She returned to acting in 1978 in &quot;The Fury&quot;.

According to Sylvester Stallone, Snodgress was the first actress considered for the role of Adrian in &quot;Rocky&quot;. However, Snodgress declined the part because it was not well-paid. &quot;Rocky&quot; director John G. Avildsen cast Snodgress in two of his later films: &quot;A Night in Heaven&quot; and &quot;8 Seconds&quot;.

Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; was inspired by Snodgress, featuring the lyric &quot;I fell in love with the actress / she was playing a part that I could understand.&quot; She also inspired the songs &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, &quot;Harvest&quot; and &quot;Out on the Weekend&quot; from Young&#x27;s album &quot;Harvest&quot;, as well as &quot;Motion Pictures&quot; from the 1974 album &quot;On the Beach&quot;. She and Young split in 1974, and his song &quot;Already One&quot;, which later appeared on his 1978 album &quot;Comes a Time&quot;, bookends their relationship. Later she and musician and film score composer Jack Nitzsche became lovers. Nitzsche had previously worked with Young on several albums. In 1979, Nitzsche was charged with threatening to kill her after he barged into her home and beat her with a handgun. He pleaded guilty to threatening her, was fined, and placed on three years&#x27; probation.

Snodgress made her off-Broadway debut in 1981 as a replacement in John Ford Noonan&#x27;s &quot;A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;All the Way Home&quot;, &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War!&quot;, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, &quot;The Balcony&quot; and &quot;The Boor&quot; (all at the Goodman Theatre, Chicago); and &quot;Curse of the Starving Class&quot; at the Tiffany Theatre (in Los Angeles). Other films include &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, &quot;Pale Rider&quot; and &quot;Blue Sky&quot;. She also worked extensively in television.

In her final film, Katja von Garnier&#x27;s &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; (2004) about the women&#x27;s suffrage movement during the 1910s, Snodgress portrayed the mother of Alice Paul, played by Hilary Swank.

==Death==
While waiting for a liver transplant, Snodgress was hospitalized in Los Angeles, where she died of heart failure on April 1, 2004, at age 58.

<doc id="217822" wikidata="Q2920685" url="?curid=217822" title="Prozac Nation">
<text>Prozac Nation is a memoir by American writer Elizabeth Wurtzel published in 1994. The book describes the author&#x27;s experiences with atypical depression, her own character failings and how she managed to live through particularly difficult periods while completing college and working as a writer. Prozac is a trade name for the antidepressant fluoxetine. Wurtzel originally titled the book &quot;I Hate Myself and I Want To Die&quot; but her editor convinced her otherwise. It ultimately carried the subtitle &quot;Young and Depressed in America: A Memoir.&quot;

The book was adapted into a feature film, &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; (2001), starring Christina Ricci.

== Reception ==

Reviews were mixed. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michiko Kakutani characterized &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; as &quot;by turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware,&quot; comparing it with the &quot;raw candor of Joan Didion&#x27;s essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; and the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song.&quot; While praising Wurtzel&#x27;s prose style as &quot;sparkling&quot; and &quot;luminescent,&quot; Kakutani thought the memoir &quot;would have benefited enormously from some strict editing&quot; and said that its &quot;self-pitying passages make the reader want to shake the author, and remind her that there are far worse fates than growing up during the &#x27;70s in New York and going to Harvard.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was ambivalent: &quot;By turns emotionally powerful and tiresomely solipsistic, [Wurtzel&#x27;s] book straddles the line between an absorbing self-portrait and a coy bid for public attention.&quot;

Writing in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Walter Kirn found that although &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; had &quot;moments of shapely truth-telling,&quot; altogether it was &quot;almost unbearable&quot; and &quot;a work of singular self-absorption.&quot; Calling the book a &quot;tedious and poorly written story of Wurtzel&#x27;s melodramatic life, warts and all (actually all warts),&quot; Erica L. Werner asked in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, &quot;How did this chick get a book contract in the first place? Why was she allowed to write such crap?&quot; Werner also described &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; as &quot;obscenely exhibitionistic,&quot; with &quot;no purpose other than alternately to bore us and make us squirm.&quot; She said that the author &quot;comes off as an irritating, solipsistic brat.&quot;

&quot;It would be possible to have more sympathy for Ms. Wurtzel if she weren&#x27;t so exasperatingly sympathetic to herself,&quot; wrote Ken Tucker in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. He observed, &quot;The reader may well begin riffling the pages of the book in the vain hope that there will be a few complimentary Prozac capsules tucked inside for one&#x27;s own relief.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; thought the book to be filled with &quot;narcissistic pride&quot; and concluded, &quot;By alternately belittling and belaboring her depression, Wurtzel loses her credibility: Either she&#x27;s a brat who won&#x27;t shape up or she needs the drugs. Ultimately, you don&#x27;t care which.&quot;

<doc id="217824" wikidata="Q1582270" url="?curid=217824" title="Diary of a Mad Housewife">
<text>Diary of a Mad Housewife is a 1970 American comedy-drama film about a frustrated wife portrayed by Carrie Snodgress. Snodgress was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won a Golden Globe award in the same category. The film was adapted by Eleanor Perry from the 1967 novel by Sue Kaufman and directed by Perry&#x27;s then-husband Frank Perry. The film co-stars Richard Benjamin and Frank Langella.

==Plot==
Tina Balser, an educated, frustrated housewife and mother, is in a loveless marriage with Jonathan, an insufferable, controlling, emotionally abusive, social-climbing lawyer in New York City. He treats her like a servant, undermines her with insults, and belittles her appearance, abilities, and the raising of their two girls, who treat their mother with the same rudeness as their father. Searching for relief, she begins a sexually fulfilling affair with a cruel and coarse writer, George Prager, who treats her with similar brusqueness and contempt, which only drives her deeper into despair.

At the climax of the film, Jonathan confesses to Tina that his ambitious plans have collapsed. A French vineyard he had invested in is wiped out, and he is now in debt. Because he has been focusing on non-job issues, his work at his law firm has suffered. He also confesses to having an affair. Tina tells Jonathan that she accepts what he has done and promises to support him, but does not tell him of her own affair with George.

In the conclusion, Tina is shown telling this story in a group therapy session, thus opening the possibility that her presentation of these events has been slanted to make her look more put-upon and the men in her life more mean and foolish. However, the other participants of her therapy group criticize and belittle her, while complaining about their own lot in life and how her issues seem petty by comparison. The final shot is of Tina&#x27;s steadfast face as angry voices from the group are heard from off-screen with the credits rolling at the sides.

==Release==
===Critical response===
The film was critically acclaimed: It maintains an 82% rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 17 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars, writing &quot;What makes the movie work...is that it&#x27;s played entirely from the housewife&#x27;s point of view, and that the housewife is played brilliantly by Carrie Snodgress.&quot;

Neil Young wrote the song &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; inspired by Snodgress in &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot;: &quot;I was watching a movie with a friend/I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part I could understand.&quot; The song was included on his 1972 album &quot;Harvest&quot;. Soon after, Young and Snodgress became romantically involved for several years.

Groucho Marx criticized the movie in an interview on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; on May 25, 1971. He stated that it was an example of dirty entertainment and that he did not like it because the characters were in bed for 80 minutes. He made a joke of this, saying &quot;Well I&#x27;m not interested in that. I don&#x27;t care what they&#x27;re doing in the sack. If I&#x27;m not doing it, why should I sit in the theater and watch it?&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
===Television edit===
When the film was premiered on NBC in 1973, Universal prepared an &quot;Edited for Television&quot; alternative version, removing all traces of nudity and strong language, and also including a substantial amount of material not found in the theatrical cut. The reinstated scenes depicted interactions between Tina and various domestics and repair personnel, and her male psychiatrist, Dr. Linstrom, as well as a confrontation between her and her disrespectful daughter Sylvie. The extent and intensity of her extramarital affair with George was toned down due to the removal of scenes depicting them naked or involved in sex activity. It was not authorized or approved by either Frank or Eleanor Perry.

===Home media===
Universal had made the film available on VHS through its MCA Home Video label, and later through license to Goodtimes Home Video. However, for many years, it was not made available on DVD, likely due to music clearance issues with the Alice Cooper performance, and VHS copies of &quot;Housewife&quot; became rare, with sealed copies routinely selling for more than $100 on websites like Amazon.com and eBay. The film was released on a bootleg DVD on October 15, 2014; After years of being out-of-print, Kino Lorber released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on December 15, 2020. The UK-based label Indicator/Powerhouse released their own Blu-ray edition in 2022, which included the long-unavailable TV recut of the film as a bonus feature.

<doc id="217827" wikidata="Q7300726" url="?curid=217827" title="Read–write conflict">
<text>In computer science, in the field of databases, read–write conflict, also known as unrepeatable reads, is a computational anomaly associated with interleaved execution of transactions. Specifically, a read–write conflict occurs when a &quot;transaction requests to read an entity for which an unclosed transaction has already made a write request.&quot;

Given a schedule S

:formula_1

In this example, T1 has read the original value of A, and is waiting for T2 to finish. T2 also reads the original value of A, overwrites A, and commits.

However, when T1 reads from A, it discovers two different versions of A, and T1 would be forced to abort, because T1 would not know what to do. This is an unrepeatable read. This could never occur in a serial schedule, in which each transaction executes in its entirety before another begins. Strict two-phase locking (Strict 2PL) or Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) prevent this conflict.

== Real-world example==
Alice and Bob are using a website to book tickets for a specific show. Only one ticket is left for the specific show. Alice signs on first to see that only one ticket is left, and finds it expensive. Alice takes time to decide. Bob signs on and also finds one ticket left, and orders it instantly. Bob purchases and logs off. Alice decides to buy a ticket, to find there are no tickets. This is a typical read–write conflict situation.

<text>JXTA (Juxtapose) was an open-source peer-to-peer protocol specification begun by Sun Microsystems in 2001. The JXTA protocols were defined as a set of XML messages which allow any device connected to a network to exchange messages and collaborate independently of the underlying network topology.

As JXTA was based upon a set of open XML protocols, it could be implemented in any modern computer language. Implementations were developed for Java SE, C/C++, C# and Java ME. The C# Version used the C++/C native bindings and was not a complete re-implementation in its own right.

JXTA peers create a virtual overlay network which allows a peer to interact with other peers even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and NATs or use different network transports. In addition, each resource is identified by a unique ID, a 160 bit SHA-1 URN in the Java binding, so that a peer can change its localization address while keeping a constant identification number.

== Status ==

&quot;In November 2010, Oracle officially announced its withdrawal from the JXTA projects&quot;. As of August 2011, the JXTA project has not yet been continued or otherwise announced to retain operations, neither a decision was made on the assembly of its Board nor an answer by Oracle regarding a pending request to move the source-code to Apache license version 2.

== Protocols in JXTA ==
* Peer Resolver Protocol
* Peer Information Protocol
* Rendezvous Protocol
* Peer Membership Protocol
* Pipe Binding Protocol
* Endpoint Routing Protocol

== Categories of peers ==
JXTA defines two main categories of peers: &quot;edge peers&quot; and &quot;super-peers&quot;. The super-peers can be further divided into &quot;rendezvous&quot; and &quot;relay peers&quot;. Each peer has a well defined role in the JXTA peer-to-peer model.
*The edge peers are usually defined as peers which have transient, low bandwidth network connectivity. They usually reside on the border of the Internet, hidden behind corporate firewalls or accessing the network through non-dedicated connections.
*A Rendezvous peer is a special purpose peer which is in charge of coordinating the peers in the JXTA network and provides the necessary scope to message propagation. If the peers are located in different subnets then the network should have at least one Rendezvous peer.
*A Relay peer allows the peers which are behind firewalls or NAT systems to take part in the JXTA network. This is performed by using a protocol which can traverse the firewall, like HTTP, for example.

Any peer in a JXTA network can be a rendezvous or relay as soon as they have the necessary credentials or network/storage/memory/CPU requirements.

== Advertisements ==
An Advertisement is an XML document which describes any resource in a P2P network (peers, groups, pipes, services, etc.). The communication in JXTA can be thought as the exchange of one or more advertisements through the network.

== Pipes ==
Pipes are a virtual communication channel used by JXTA to exchange messages and data. Pipes are asynchronous, unreliable, and unidirectional. There are basically three types of pipes:
* Unicast
* Uni-cast Secure
* Propagate

== Peer groups ==
A peer group provides a scope for message propagation and a logical clustering of peers. In JXTA, every peer is a member of a default group, NetPeerGroup, but a given peer can be member of many sub-groups at the same time. A peer may play different roles in different groups; it may act as an edge peer in one group, but a rendezvous in another.

Each group should have at least one rendezvous peer and it is not possible to send messages between two groups.

== Rendezvous network ==
The Rendezvous peers have an optimized routing mechanism which allows an efficient propagation of messages pushed by edge peers connected to them. This is achieved through the use of a loosely consistent network.

Each Rendezvous peer maintains a Rendezvous Peer View (RPV), a list of known rendezvous peers ordered by the Peer ID. There is not any mechanism to enforce the consistency of all RPVs across the JXTA network, so a given RPV can have a temporary or permanent inconsistent view of the other rendezvous peers. As soon as there is a low churn rate, that is, a stable network where peers don&#x27;t join or leave too frequently, the RPV list of each peer will converge as each rendezvous peer exchange a random subset of its RPV with other rendezvous peers from time to time.

When an edge peer publishes an Advertisement, the index of this advertisement is pushed to the rendezvous through a system called Shared Resource Distributed Index (SRDI). After that, the rendezvous applies a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) function so that it can forward the index to another peer in the RPV list. For replication purposes, it will send this index to the neighbours of the chosen rendezvous peer in the RPV list.

The lookup process requires the use of the same DHT function to discover the rendezvous peer which is in charge of storing that index. Once the rendezvous peer is reached it will forward the query to the edge peer which published the advertisement and this peer will get in touch with the peer which issues the query.

If the DHT function cannot find a peer which is in charge of the advertisement then the query will be forwarded up and down the RPV list until a match is found, the query is aborted, or it reaches the limits of the RPV list. This process is called random walk.

<doc id="217831" wikidata="Q319434" url="?curid=217831" title="Julian Lloyd Webber">
<text>Julian Lloyd Webber (born 14 April 1951) is a British solo cellist, conductor and broadcaster, a former principal of Royal Birmingham Conservatoire and the founder of the In Harmony music education programme.

==Early years and education==
Julian Lloyd Webber is the second son of the composer and music educator William Lloyd Webber and his wife, Jean Johnstone (a piano teacher). He is the younger brother of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. The composer Herbert Howells was his godfather. He won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in 1968 and completed his studies with Pierre Fournier in Geneva in 1973.

==Career==
Lloyd Webber made his professional debut as a cellist at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, in September 1972 when he gave the first London performance of the cello concerto by Sir Arthur Bliss. Throughout his career, he has collaborated with a wide variety of musicians, including conductors Yehudi Menuhin, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Georg Solti, Yevgeny Svetlanov, Mark Elder, Andrew Davis, Charles Mackerras and Esa-Pekka Salonen, pianists Clifford Curzon and Murray Perahia as well as Stéphane Grappelli, Elton John and Cleo Laine. He was described in &quot;The Strad&quot; as the &quot; of British cellists&quot;.

His many recordings include his BRIT Award-winning Elgar Cello Concerto conducted by Yehudi Menuhin (chosen as the finest ever version by &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;), the Dvořák Cello Concerto with Václav Neumann and the Czech Philharmonic, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Rococo Variations with the London Symphony Orchestra under Maxim Shostakovich and a coupling of Britten&#x27;s Cello Symphony and Walton&#x27;s Cello Concerto with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields which was described as &quot;beyond any rival&quot; by Edward Greenfield in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine, He has also made several recordings of shorter pieces for Universal Classics including &quot;Made in England&quot;, &quot;Cello Moods&quot;, &quot;Cradle Song&quot; and &quot;English Idyll&quot;.

Lloyd Webber has premiered the recordings of more than 50 works, inspiring new compositions for cello from composers as diverse as Malcolm Arnold (Fantasy for Cello, 1986, and Cello Concerto, 1989), Joaquín Rodrigo (&quot;Concierto como un divertimento&quot;, 1982) James MacMillan (Cello Sonata No. 2, 2001), and Philip Glass (Cello Concerto, 2001). More recent concert performances have included four further works composed for Lloyd Webber – Michael Nyman&#x27;s Double Concerto for Cello and Saxophone on BBC Television, Gavin Bryars&#x27;s Concerto in Suntory Hall, Tokyo, Glass&#x27;s Cello Concerto at the Beijing International Festival and Eric Whitacre&#x27;s &quot;The River Cam&quot; at the Southbank Centre. His recording of the Glass concerto with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic conducted by Gerard Schwarz was released on Glass&#x27; Orange Mountain label in September 2005.

Other recordings include &quot;The Art of Julian Lloyd Webber&quot; (2011), &quot;Evening Songs&quot; (2012), &quot;A Tale of Two Cellos&quot; (2013), &quot;Vivaldi Concertos for Two Cellos&quot; together with Jiaxin Cheng (2014) and his debut recording as a conductor of English music for strings &quot;And the Bridge Is Love&quot; (2015).

In May 2009, Lloyd Webber was elected President of the Elgar Society in succession to Sir Adrian Boult, Lord Menuhin, and Richard Hickox.

On 28 April 2014, Lloyd Webber announced his retirement from public performance as a cellist because of a herniated disc in his neck which reduced the power in his bow arm. His final public performance as a cellist was on 2 May 2014 at the Festival Theatre, Malvern, with the English Chamber Orchestra.

In September 2014, the charity Live Music Now announced Lloyd Webber as its public spokesman.

In July 2015 Lloyd Webber was appointed Principal of Royal Birmingham Conservatoire.

In 2016 Lloyd Webber scripted and presented &#x27;Classic Cellists at the BBC&#x27; for BBC TV and in 2019, to commemorate the centenary of the first performance of Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto in October 1919, Lloyd Webber scripted and presented &#x27;Music in the Air: 100 years of Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto&#x27; for Classic FM.

In 2021 Lloyd Webber presented and scripted a five-part series for Classic FM in which he chose &quot;30 under 30 of today&#x27;s finest young musicians at a time when it has never been more difficult for them to show their talents on stage&quot;. In November 2021 Sky Arts screened the TV special &quot;Classic FM&#x27;s Rising Stars with Julian Lloyd Webber&quot;. In July 2022 Lloyd Webber made a further selection of 30 Rising Stars together with Classic FM and another Sky Arts special was shown in November 2022. A third series of Rising Stars was announced by Classic FM in March 2023 and broadcast on 13 November 2023 In November 2023 Lloyd Webber was presented with the London Cello Society&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award

==Involvement with music education==
Demonstrating his long involvement with music education, he formed the Music Education Consortium with James Galway and Evelyn Glennie in 2003. As a result of successful and continued lobbying by the Consortium, on 21 November 2007, the UK government announced an infusion of £332 million for music education. In 2008, the British government invited Lloyd Webber to be chairman of its In Harmony programme which is based on the Venezuelan social programme El Sistema. The government-commissioned Henley Review of Music Education (2011) reported, &quot;There is no doubt that they [the In Harmony projects] have delivered life-changing experiences.&quot; In July 2011 the founder of El Sistema in Venezuela, José Antonio Abreu, recognised In Harmony as part of the El Sistema worldwide network. Further, in November 2011 the British government announced additional support for In Harmony across England by extending funding from the Department for Education and adding funding from Arts Council England from 2012 to 2015. Lloyd Webber now chairs the charity Sistema England. In October 2012 he led the Incorporated Society of Musicians campaign against the implementation of the English Baccalaureate which proposed to remove arts subjects from the core curriculum. In February 2013 the government withdrew its plans. Lloyd Webber has represented the arts sector on programmes such as BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;, BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The World at One&quot;, &quot;PM&quot;, &quot;Front Row&quot; and &quot;The World Tonight&quot;.

Lloyd Webber was part of the expert panel which produced the UK government&#x27;s Model Music Curriculum in March 2021.

He is a patron of the charity Quartet of Peace, which supports the further education of talented young South African musicians , honorary patron of the Nucleo Project and an inaugural ambassador of the London Music Fund. He is also the patron of Guildford County School and a patron of the Purcell School

==Principal of Royal Birmingham Conservatoire==

Lloyd Webber was appointed principal of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire in July 2015. During his five-year tenure he oversaw the move to a new £57 million building on the Birmingham City University City Centre Campus and the merger of the Conservatoire with the Birmingham School of Acting. In September 2017 the Conservatoire received the Royal status by Queen Elizabeth II. In September 2020, in recognition of his tenure, Lloyd Webber was appointed Emeritus Professor of Performing Arts by Birmingham City University.
==Honours and awards==
Lloyd Webber received the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum in 1998 and a Classic FM Red Award for outstanding services to music in 2005. He won the Best British Classical Recording at the 1986 Brit Awards for his recording of Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto with Sir Yehudi Menuhin and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1994 and has received honorary doctorates from the University of Hull, Plymouth University and Thames Valley University.

He is vice president of the Delius Society and a patron of Music in Hospitals and the patron of the Elgar Festival He has been an ambassador for the Prince&#x27;s Trust for more than thirty years and a patron of CLIC Sargent for more than thirty years.

In May 2001, he was granted the first busker&#x27;s licence on the London Underground.

In September 2009 he joined the board of governors of the Southbank Centre. He was the Foundling Museum&#x27;s Handel Fellow for 2010. He was the only classical musician chosen to play at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

On 16 April 2014 Lloyd Webber received the Incorporated Society of Musicians Distinguished Musician Award.

Lloyd Webber was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to music.

==Personal life==
In 1974, aged 23, Lloyd Webber married Celia Ballantyne, a marriage that lasted 15 years. In 1989 he married Zohra Mahmoud Ghazi, a great niece of Mohammed Zahir Shah, king of Afghanistan, with whom he had a son. His third marriage was to French-Algerian Kheira Bourahla. In 2009 he married fellow cellist Jiaxin Cheng. The couple have one daughter.

He is a lifelong supporter of Leyton Orient football club in east London.

<text>Reona Esaki (江崎 玲於奈 &quot;Esaki Reona&quot;, born March 12, 1925), also known as Leo Esaki, is a Japanese physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 with Ivar Giaever and Brian David Josephson for his work in electron tunneling in semiconductor materials which finally led to his invention of the Esaki diode, which exploited that phenomenon. This research was done when he was with Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now known as Sony). He has also contributed in being a pioneer of the semiconductor superlattices.

==Early life and education==
Esaki was born in Takaida-mura, Nakakawachi-gun, Osaka Prefecture (now part of Higashiōsaka City) and grew up in Kyoto. He attended Doshisha Junior High School, then the Third Higher School. After graduating, he studied physics at Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo), where he attended Hideki Yukawa&#x27;s course in nuclear theory. He experienced the Bombing of Tokyo while at university.

Esaki received his BSc and PhD in 1947 and 1959, respectively, from the University of Tokyo (UTokyo).

== Career ==

===Esaki diode===
From 1947 to 1960, Esaki joined Kawanishi Corporation (now Denso Ten) and Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now Sony). Meanwhile, American physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley invented the transistor, which encouraged Esaki to change fields from vacuum tube to heavily-doped germanium and silicon research in Sony. One year later, he recognized that when the PN junction width of germanium is thinned, the current-voltage characteristic is dominated by the influence of the tunnel effect and, as a result, he discovered that as the voltage is increased, the current decreases inversely, indicating negative resistance. This discovery was the first demonstration of solid tunneling effects in physics, and it was the birth of new electronic devices in electronics called Esaki diode (or tunnel diode), the first quantum electronic device invention in history. He received a doctorate degree from UTokyo due to this breakthrough invention in 1959.

In 1973, Esaki was awarded the Nobel Prize for research conducted around 1958 regarding electron tunneling in solids. He became the first Nobel laureate to receive the prize from the hands of the King Carl XVI Gustaf.

===Semiconductor superlattice===
Esaki moved to the United States in 1960 and joined the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, where he became an IBM Fellow in 1967. He predicted that semiconductor superlattices will be formed to induce a differential negative-resistance effect via an artificially one-dimensional periodic structural changes in semiconductor crystals. His unique &quot;molecular beam epitaxy&quot; thin-film crystal growth method can be regulated quite precisely in ultrahigh vacuum. His first paper on the semiconductor superlattice was published in 1970. A 1987 comment by Esaki regarding the original paper notes:

&quot;The original version of the paper was rejected for publication by &quot;Physical Review&quot; on the referee&#x27;s unimaginative assertion that it was &#x27;too speculative&#x27; and involved &#x27;no new physics.&#x27; However, this proposal was quickly accepted by the Army Research Office...&quot;
In 1972, Esaki realized his concept of superlattices in III-V group semiconductors, later the concept influenced many fields like metals, and magnetic materials. He was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to the engineering of semiconductor devices in 1977. He also awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor &quot;for contributions to and leadership in tunneling, semiconductor superlattices, and quantum wells&quot; in 1991 and the Japan Prize &quot;for the creation and realization of the concept of man-made superlattice crystals which lead to generation of new materials with useful applications&quot; in 1998.

==Esaki&#x27;s &quot;five don&#x27;ts&quot; rules==
In the 1994 Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Esaki suggests a list of &quot;five don&#x27;ts&quot; which anyone in realizing his creative potential should follow. Two months later, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics Carl Nordling incorporated the rules in his own speech.

#Don&#x27;t allow yourself to be trapped by your past experiences.
#Don&#x27;t allow yourself to become overly attached to any one authority in your field – the great professor, perhaps.
#Don&#x27;t hold on to what you don&#x27;t need.
#Don&#x27;t avoid confrontation.
#Don&#x27;t forget your spirit of childhood curiosity.

==Later years==
Esaki moved back to Japan in 1992. Subsequently, he served as president of the University of Tsukuba and Shibaura Institute of Technology. Since 2006 he is the president of Yokohama College of Pharmacy. Esaki is also the recipient of The International Center in New York&#x27;s Award of Excellence, the Order of Culture (1974) and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (1998).

After the death of Yoichiro Nambu in 2015, Esaki is the eldest Japanese Nobel laureate.

==Recognition==
In recognition of three Nobel laureates&#x27; contributions, the bronze statues of Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga, Leo Esaki, and Makoto Kobayashi were set up in the Central Park of Azuma 2 in Tsukuba City in 2015.

<doc id="217833" wikidata="Q117678" url="?curid=217833" title="DVD-Audio">
<text>DVD-Audio (commonly abbreviated as DVD-A) is a digital format for delivering high-fidelity audio content on a DVD. DVD-Audio uses most of the storage on the disc for high-quality audio and is not intended to be a video delivery format.

The standard was published in March 1999 and the first discs entered the marketplace in 2000. DVD-Audio was in a format war with Super Audio CD (SACD), and along with consumers&#x27; tastes tending towards downloadable music, these factors meant that neither high-quality disc achieved considerable market traction; DVD-Audio has been described as &quot;extinct&quot; by 2007. DVD-Audio remains a niche market but some independent online labels offer a wider choice of titles.

==Audio specifications==
DVD-Audio offers many possible configurations of audio channels, ranging from single-channel mono to 5.1-channel surround sound, at various sampling frequencies and sample rates. (The &quot;.1&quot; denotes a low-frequency effects channel (LFE) for bass and/or special audio effects.)

Compared to the compact disc, the much higher capacity DVD format enables the inclusion of either:
*Considerably more music (with respect to total running time and quantity of songs) or
*Encoding at higher linear sampling rates and more bits-per-sample, and/or
*Additional channels for surround sound reproduction.

Audio on a DVD-Audio disc can be stored in many different bit depth/sampling rate/channel combinations:

Different bit depth/sampling rate/channel combinations can be used on a single disc. For instance, a DVD-Audio disc may contain a 96 kHz/24-bit 5.1-channel audio track as well as a 192 kHz/24-bit stereo audio track. Also, the channels of a track can be split into two groups stored at different resolutions. For example, the front speakers could be 96/24, while the surrounds are 48/20.

Audio is stored on the disc in Linear PCM format, which is either uncompressed or losslessly compressed with MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing). The maximum permissible total bit rate is 9.6 Megabits per second. Channel/resolution combinations that would exceed this need to be compressed. In uncompressed modes, it is possible to get up to 96/16 or 48/24 in 5.1, and 192/24 in stereo. To store 5.1 tracks in 88.2/20, 88.2/24, 96/20 or 96/24 MLP encoding is mandatory.

If no native stereo audio exists on the disc, the DVD-Audio player may be able to downmix the 5.1-channel audio to two-channel stereo audio if the listener does not have a surround sound setup (provided that the coefficients were set in the stream at authoring). Downmixing can only be done to two-channel stereo, not to other configurations, such as 4.0 quad. DVD-Audio may also feature menus, text subtitles, still images and video, plus in high end authoring systems it is also possible to link directly into a Video_TS directory that might contain video tracks, as well as PCM stereo and other &quot;bonus&quot; features.

==Player compatibility==
With the introduction of the DVD-Audio format, some kind of backward compatibility with existing DVD-Video players was desired, although not required. To address this, most DVD-Audio discs also contain DVD-Video compatible data to play the standard DVD-Video Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio track on the disc (which can be downmixed to two channels for listeners with no surround sound setup). Many DVD-Video players also offer the option to create a Dolby MP matrix-encoded soundtrack for older surround sound systems lacking Dolby Digital or DTS decoding. Some discs also include a native Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, and even a DTS 96/24 5.1-channel, audio track.

Since the DVD-Audio format is a member of the DVD family, a single disc can have multiple layers, and even two sides that contain audio and video material. A common configuration is a single-sided DVD with content in both the DVD-Video (VIDEO_TS) and DVD-Audio (AUDIO_TS) directories. The high-resolution, Packed PCM audio encoded using MLP is only playable by DVD players containing DVD-Audio decoding capability. DVD-Video content, which can include LPCM, Dolby or DTS material, and even video, makes the disc compatible with all DVD players. Other disc configurations may consist of double layer DVDs (DVD-9) or two-sided discs (DVD-10, DVD-14 or DVD-18). Some labels have released two-sided DVD titles that contain DVD-Audio content on one side and DVD-Video content on the other, the Classic Records HDAD being one such example.

Unofficial playback of DVD-Audio on a PC is possible through freeware audio player foobar2000 for Windows using an open source plug-in extension called DVDADecoder. VLC media player has DVD-Audio support Cyberlink&#x27;s PowerDVD Version 8 provides an official method of playing DVD-Audio discs. This feature was dropped from version 9 onwards. Creative also provide a dedicated DVD-Audio player with some of its Soundblaster Audigy and X-Fi cards.

==Preamplifier/surround-processor interface==
In order to play DVD-Audio, a preamplifier or surround controller with six analog inputs was originally required. Whereas DVD-Video audio formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS can be sent via the player&#x27;s digital output to a receiver for conversion to analog form and distribution to speakers, DVD-Audio is not allowed to be delivered via unencrypted digital audio link at sample rates higher than 48 kHz (i.e., ordinary DVD-Video quality) due to concerns about digital copying.

However, encrypted digital formats have now been approved by the DVD Forum, the first of which was Meridian Audio&#x27;s MHR (Meridian High Resolution). The High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI 1.1) also allows encrypted digital audio to be carried up to DVD-Audio specification (6 × 24-bit/96 kHz channels or 2 × 24-bit/192 kHz channels). The six channels of audio information can thus be sent to the amplifier by several different methods:
#The 6 audio channels can be decrypted and extracted in the player and sent to the amplifier along 6 standard analog cables.
#The 6 audio channels can be decrypted and then re-encrypted into an HDMI or IEEE-1394 (FireWire) signal and sent to the amplifier, which will then decrypt the digital signal and then extract the 6 channels of audio. HDMI and IEEE-1394 encryption are different from the DVD-A encryption and were designed as a general standard for a high-quality digital interface. The amplifier has to be equipped with a valid decryption key or it will not play the disk.
#The third option is via the S/PDIF (or TOSLINK) digital interface. However, because of concerns over unauthorized copying, DVD-A players are required to handle this digital interface in one of the following ways:
#*Turn such an interface off completely. This option is preferred by music publishers.
#*Downconvert the audio to a 2-channel 16-bit/48 kHz PCM signal. The music publishers are not enthusiastic about this because it permits the production of a CD-quality copy, something they still expect to sell, besides DVD-A.
#*Downconvert the audio to 2 channels, but keep the original sample size and bit rate if the producer sets a flag on the DVD-A disc telling the player to do so.
#A final option is to modify the player, capturing the high-resolution digital signals before they are fed to internal D/A converters and convert it to S/PDIF, giving full-range digital (but only stereo) sound. There exists already do-it-yourself solutions for some players. There also exists an option to equip a DVD-A player with multiple S/PDIF outputs, for full-resolution multichannel digital output.

==Sound quality==
Researchers in 2004 found that, amongst a selected group of listeners on a selected playback setup, no perceptible difference was reported in audio quality between DVD-A and SACD.

The claimed benefits of high-resolution audio, such as that supported by DVD-A, are the subject of controversy (see ).

==Format variants==
Four of the major music labels, Universal Music, EMI, Warner Bros. Records, Naxos Records and several smaller audiophile labels (such as AIX Records, Claudio Records, DTS Entertainment, Silverline Records, OgreOgress Productions, Tacet and Teldec) have released albums on DVD-Audio, but the number is minimal compared to standard CDs. New high-definition titles have been released in standard DVD-Video format (which can contain two-channel Linear PCM audio data ranging from 48 kHz/16-bit to 96 kHz/24-bit), &quot;HDAD&quot;, which includes a DVD-Video format recording on one side and DVD-Audio on the other, CD/DVD packages, which can include the album on both CD and DVD-Audio, or DualDisc, which can contain DVD-Audio content on the DVD side. In addition, some titles that had been initially released as a standalone DVD-Audio disc (such as The Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;American Beauty&quot; and R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;) were re-released as a CD/DVD package or as a DualDisc.

==Copy protection==
DVD-Audio discs may optionally employ a copy protection mechanism called Content Protection for Prerecorded Media (CPPM). CPPM, managed by the 4C Entity, was designed to prevent users from extracting audio to computers and portable media players.

Because DVD-Video&#x27;s content-scrambling system (CSS) was quickly broken, the proposed launch of DVD-Audio was postponed from Autumn 1999 and the music labels stalled software production while DVD-Audio&#x27;s developers sought a better method of blocking unauthorized duplications. They developed CPPM, which uses a media key block (MKB) to authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use its own unique key to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player&#x27;s decryption key is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize digital watermarking technology developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc without a valid MKB, it will halt playback. The 4C Entity also developed a similar specification, Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which is used on Secure Digital cards.

DVD-Audio&#x27;s copy protection was overcome in 2005 by tools which allow data to be decrypted or converted to 6 channel .WAV files without going through lossy digital-to-analog conversion. Previously that conversion had required expensive equipment to retain all six channels of audio rather than having it downmixed to stereo. In the digital method, the decryption is done by a commercial software player which has been patched to allow access to the unprotected audio.

In 2007 the encryption scheme was overcome with a tool called &quot;dvdcpxm&quot;. On 12 February 2008 a program called DVD-Audio Explorer was released, containing the aforementioned libdvdcpxm coupled with an open-source MLP decoder.

Like DVD-Video decryption, such tools may be illegal to use in the United States under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. While the Recording Industry Association of America has been successful in keeping these tools off Web sites, they are still distributed on P2P file sharing networks and newsgroups. Additionally, in 2007 the widely used commercial software DVDFab Platinum added DVD-Audio decryption, allowing users to back up a full DVD-A image to an ISO image file.

<text>Glenageary ( , meaning &quot;Glen of the Sheep&quot;) is an area in the suburbs of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Ireland. While there is no officially defined boundary, it is surrounded by the areas of Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Glasthule, Johnstown, Killiney and Sallynoggin. The Church of Ireland does have a defined boundary for the Parish of Glenageary.

On early 20th century maps, Glenageary and Sallynoggin are considered to be the same place and it was not until the building of local authority houses in the late 1940s and 1950s in the townlands of Honeypark and Thomastown by Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation that a clear distinction between Sallynoggin and Glenageary was created.

The Roman Catholic Parish of Glasthule covers all of Glasthule and Sandycove together with Glenageary east of Upper Glenageary Road and south of Lower Glenageary Road.

== History ==
Until the late 1940s, Glenageary, like much of the south County Dublin, consisted mostly of large manor estates - each comprising a large house, some woodland and cultivated or landscaped fields. Since then it has been extensively redeveloped. Most of the original manors have been demolished and low-density housing developments built.

Glenageary has one church, St Paul&#x27;s at the junction of Adelaide and Silchester Roads, which is a (Church of Ireland) church. It was opened in 1868.

== Transport ==
The area is served by Dublin Bus, routes 7 (Every 30 minutes. 40 minutes on Sundays.) and 59 (every hour). Other routes nearby in Sallynoggin include the 7a, 45a and 111 although these vary in frequency and service periods. Glenageary has its own railway station which is served by Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s DART that provides service between Greystones to the south, and Howth and Malahide to the north. Glenageary railway station opened on 1 November 1867.

== People ==
* Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and her novelist brother Joseph O&#x27;Connor spent some of their early lives in Glenageary
* Niall Connolly, one of the Colombia Three, spent his childhood in Glenageary
* Colm Ó Cíosóig, musician and drummer of My Bloody Valentine, is from Glenageary
* John Dowse was an Irish-born British Army medical officer in World Wars I and II.
* Raonaid Murray, a 17-year-old resident, was murdered on Silchester Road on 4 September 1999 near her home.

<doc id="217835" wikidata="Q1002142" url="?curid=217835" title="Buffalo '66">
<text>Buffalo &#x27;66 is a 1998 American independent romantic comedy-drama film directed by Vincent Gallo, who co-wrote the screenplay with Alison Bagnall from a story by Gallo. It stars Gallo, Christina Ricci, Ben Gazzara, Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael Vincent, and Anjelica Huston. The film follows a man who is released from prison and subsequently kidnaps a young tap dancer, forces her to pretend to be his wife to impress his parents, and seeks revenge on the Buffalo Bills kicker he blames for losing a championship game.

The title refers to the Buffalo Bills, who had not won a championship since the 1965 American Football League Championship Game. The plot involves direct references to the Bills&#x27; narrow loss to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXV, which was decided by a missed field goal. It was filmed in and around Gallo&#x27;s hometown of Buffalo, New York. The film uses English progressive rock bands such as King Crimson and Yes on its soundtrack. It was generally well-received, especially Ricci&#x27;s performance. &quot;Empire&quot; listed it as the 36th greatest independent film of all time. It grossed $2.4 million on a budget of $1.5 million.

==Plot==
Having just served five years in the Gowanda Correctional Facility, Billy Brown returns home to Buffalo, New York, and is preparing to meet with his parents, who do not know he has been in prison. He kidnaps Layla, a tap dancer, and forces her to pretend to be his wife to his parents. He gives her the name &quot;Wendy Balsam&quot;.

When they meet with Billy&#x27;s parents, Layla sees that the relationship between them is very dysfunctional, seeing Billy&#x27;s mother forgetting he has a chocolate allergy and his father behaving inappropriately toward her. She learns that Billy&#x27;s mother has never missed a Buffalo Bills game, except in 1966, on the day Billy was born. In a flashback, it is revealed that Billy once placed a reckless $10,000 bet on the Bills to win Super Bowl XXV; when they lost, the bookie forced Billy to clear his debt by confessing to a crime he did not commit, resulting in his time served in prison. Now, Billy seeks revenge on Scott Wood, the kicker who lost the game.

As they leave his parents&#x27; house, Billy scolds Layla for telling an obvious lie to his father, and then decides to go bowling. There, Billy shows off his expertise at the sport, and Layla performs a tap dance routine to King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Moonchild&quot;. The two use a photo booth to take photos &quot;spanning time&quot; which Billy intends to send to his parents once a year, but Billy becomes annoyed when Layla makes silly faces during the photos, in contrast to Billy&#x27;s straight face.

After bowling, Billy and Layla visit a diner, where Billy encounters the real Wendy Balsam, a woman he used to have a crush on in middle school, who is now happily in a relationship with another man. Billy leaves Layla alone in the diner after a brief argument, but regretting his outburst, returns and apologizes to her. Billy and Layla check into a motel, where Billy and Layla have a deep conversation, and eventually admit that they have fallen in love with each other, and they both go to sleep.

A few hours after midnight, he is about to leave to exact his revenge on Wood, when Layla awakens. Despite Layla&#x27;s doubts that he will return and proclamation of her love for him, he leaves, lying to her that he will return in a few minutes with hot chocolate for her. Shortly after leaving Layla at the motel, Billy calls his best friend Goon (who prefers to be called Rocky) and gives him the combination to his locker. Billy then hangs up and finds Scott Wood, now the owner of a topless bar. At the bar he walks over to Wood&#x27;s table and shoots him before shooting himself. His parents are then shown sitting by his grave with his mother more interested in a Buffalo game on the radio than in her own son&#x27;s death. However, this is all shown to be in Billy&#x27;s head, and he leaves the bar without shooting Wood. Billy realizes that in Layla he has found someone who truly loves him. After making amends with his friend Goon on a payphone, Billy elatedly buys Layla her hot chocolate and a heart-shaped cookie, and buys another for a man sitting nearby who tells him he has a girlfriend, before returning to Layla at the motel.

==Cast==
==Production==
Gallo wrote the first draft of the script in 1989, initially involving a character trying to win a big part in a movie. Among other motivations such as his hometown Buffalo Bills losing Super Bowl XXV in 1991, Gallo rewrote the script. The screenplay is credited to Gallo and Alison Bagnall, who he contended that was &quot;really was my typist for a couple of weeks, and I had to give her that credit because I didn’t get her to sign anything first.&quot;

The film was originally set to be directed by filmmaker Monte Hellman. However, disagreements between Gallo and the film&#x27;s producers (who wanted to wait for snow to fall) led to Gallo deciding to direct the film himself.

During filming, Gallo had difficulties working with his cast and crew, and reportedly did not get along with Ricci on set. Gallo called Ricci a &quot;puppet&quot; who did what she was told. Ricci vowed never to work with Gallo again. She also resented comments Gallo made about her weight three or four years after filming. Anjelica Huston also had issues with Gallo, and Gallo claimed Huston caused the film to be turned down by the Cannes Film Festival. After Gallo fired original cinematographer Dick Pope, director Stéphane Sednaoui suggested Lance Acord, though Gallo has claimed credit for designing most of the film&#x27;s cinematography, saying Acord was simply a &quot;button pusher&quot; who had &quot;never shot a feature film in his life&quot;. Gallo also publicly disparaged Acord, saying, &quot;This guy had no ideas, no conceptual ideas, no aesthetic point of view.&quot; Kevin Corrigan chose to opt out of the credits because he did not want to be associated with the film at the time.

Gallo was unable to use real NFL logos or to refer to the team as the &quot;Buffalo Bills&quot;—just &quot;Buffalo&quot; or &quot;the Bills&quot;—as NFL Properties was uncooperative. Kicker Scott Norwood was invited to participate in the film but declined, meaning Gallo had to change the character&#x27;s name to Scott Wood.

The film was made for just under $2 million. It was filmed on reversal stock to give it a classic look similar to that of NFL Films reels from the 1960s, with high color saturation and contrast.

Gallo has stated that despite popular misconception, the film &quot;isn&#x27;t autobiographical in any real way. Yes, the parents are based on my mother and father, but that&#x27;s a conceptual gimmick. People often diminish the multitasking on that film by calling it autobiographical. The interesting thing about me is that I don&#x27;t relate to Billy Brown in any way, because I don&#x27;t take that abuse in any other form.&quot; He also expressed a &quot;big catharsis in writing the script, and an even bigger one making the movie.&quot;

It is presumed that the inspiration for Layla&#x27;s appearance in the film is based on the album cover and title of Derek and the Dominoes album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, as the cover depicts a female with blonde hair, bright red lipstick and blue eyeshadow.

==Music==
Most of the film&#x27;s score was composed and performed by Gallo himself. The score features re-recordings of four tracks that first appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, which was released in a limited vinyl-only edition in 1992.

The soundtrack also makes use of several other songs, including &quot;Fools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread)&quot; by Nelson Riddle in a cover version performed by Gallo&#x27;s father Vincent Gallo Sr., &quot;Moonchild&quot; by King Crimson, &quot;I Remember When&quot; by Stan Getz, and &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Sweetness&quot; by Yes.

==Themes and analysis==
Gallo, who is a political conservative, has stated that &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66 &quot; is a political film. In an interview with filmmaker Caveh Zahedi, Gallo stated:

&quot;In &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;, the idea was of this extremely misguided victim who saw himself as a victim in the most unreasonable, unrealistic ways. That his life transforms the minute he takes responsibility for his own life is a direct political statement – a very uncomfortable one for many people because socialists feel quite opposed to that.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Self-indulgent yet intriguing, &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; marks an auspicious feature debut for writer-director-star Vincent Gallo while showcasing a terrific performance from Christina Ricci.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

In &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, film critic Andrew Johnston noted: &quot;Ricci and Huston give poignant depth to characters that could have been cartoons, and Gallo makes Billy both annoying and sympathetic with seeming effortlessness. But the film&#x27;s most potent ingredient is its visual style. The film&#x27;s washed-out colors and the flashbacks that explode from Billy&#x27;s head like comic-book thought balloons make &quot;Buffalo&quot; feel less like a movie than a dream given form.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, awarding it 3/4 stars, and writing that it &quot;plays like a collision between a lot of half-baked visual ideas and a deep and urgent need. That makes it interesting.&quot; Film critic Elvis Mitchell praised the film in an interview with Gallo, describing the film as &quot;touching&quot;.

The film has since gained a cult following, especially in Japan.

===Accolades===
==In popular culture==
* Dialogue from the film is sampled in reverse during the song &quot;I&#x27;m Getting Closer&quot; on &quot;M83&quot; by the band M83.

<doc id="217837" wikidata="Q362353" url="?curid=217837" title="Vincent Gallo">
<text>Vincent Gallo (born April 11, 1961) is an American actor, filmmaker, and musician. He has won several accolades, including a Volpi Cup for Best Actor, and has been nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or, the Golden Lion, and the Bronze Horse.

Following a childhood working for the local mafia, Gallo began his professional career as a Formula II motorcycle racer. He went on to become a successful painter and musician, working with Jean-Michel Basquiat and Lukas Haas. Gallo later became an actor and starred in films including &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993), &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (1993), &quot;Palookaville&quot; (1995), &quot;The Funeral&quot; (1996), &quot;Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby&quot; (1999), &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot; (2001), &quot;Stranded&quot; (2001), &quot;Tetro&quot; (2009), &quot;Metropia&quot; (2009), &quot;Essential Killing&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Legend of Kaspar Hauser&quot; (2012). 

As a filmmaker, Gallo directed, wrote, and starred in three independent films, &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998), &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2003), and &quot;Promises Written in Water&quot; (2010). &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; received critical acclaim; &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; proved divisive and sparked several controversies; and &quot;Promises Written in Water&quot; received mostly negative reviews, though a minority of critics lauded it.

Gallo has also directed and starred in numerous short films, including &quot;The Agent&quot; (2010), and several music videos, such as &quot;Going Inside&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan Bloodloss&quot;, and &quot;99 Problems&quot;. Gallo has released several solo recordings on Warp Records, including the album &quot;When&quot;. As a model, he has been photographed for several fashion houses and brands including Calvin Klein, H&amp;M, Supreme, Persol, and Yves Saint Laurent.

Gallo&#x27;s work has gained a cult following, especially in Japan. Gallo&#x27;s acting performances have been widely praised by critics, while his directorial work has proven divisive. Fans of Gallo&#x27;s work have notably included Jean-Luc Godard, John Waters, Werner Herzog, Claire Denis, David Lowery, and Robert Pattinson.

==Early life==
Vincent Gallo was born on April 11, 1961, in Buffalo, New York to Vincent Gallo Sr. and Janet Gallo. He is the second of three children, having an older brother, Charles, and a younger sister, Janine. Gallo was raised Catholic, and made his First Communion in 1969.

Gallo&#x27;s parents are Sicilian and worked as hairdressers, with his father having retired to be &quot;a gambler.&quot; 
Gallo has described his parents as dishonest people, saying &quot;If it was my birthday, I knew my mother took me to the K-Mart and she stole my toy. She&#x27;d put it in the shopping cart and we&#x27;d walk out. I was raised with that.&quot; Growing up, Gallo says that his father was abusive and beat him on several occasions, including one instance where Gallo&#x27;s father broke his nose. He has said that while growing up, his father was &quot;this kind of dark, raging figurehead...That&#x27;s not who he is today, but when I was a child there wasn&#x27;t a day...when he didn&#x27;t hit me, punish me, yell at me or tell me something I did wrong.&quot; Gallo&#x27;s mother also forbade him from decorating his own room, which he shared with his siblings and grandfather, and from owning a guitar, leading Gallo to secretly hide the latter underneath his bed. Gallo has attributed his self-described controlling and perfectionist nature as a filmmaker to his childhood experiences.

At the age of 12, Gallo worked for the local mafia in Buffalo, helping them to perform small crimes, such as carjacking and shoplifting. Gallo worked for the mafia for approximately one year, and desired to continue down a life of crime and become a powerful gangster. However, he was eventually convinced by a mafia member, who felt that Gallo was wasting his potential, to abandon it in favor of a legitimate career.

After graduating from Sweet Home High School in 1978, Gallo left his home in Buffalo and ran away to New York City at the age of 16. He took up various jobs, including ones working in a hi-fi guitar shop and as a restaurant dishwasher. 

Gallo went on to race motorbikes professionally, without training, in Formula II. Gallo performed at a professional level in Grand Prix racing, racing for Yamaha, but never won a national championship. In the 1980&#x27;s, he raced 125cc and 250cc WERA bikes; and later performed his own racing scenes in his 2004 film &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;. In the film, Gallo rides a gold Honda NSR250, which he personally designed. He also went on to become a successful painter.

==Film career==
===20th century===
During Gallo&#x27;s artistic period in the 1980s, when he worked as a musician and painter in New York City, he also began experimenting with film. Gallo created the short film &quot;If You Feel Froggy, Jump&quot; and appeared in the 1981 film &quot;Downtown 81&quot; with painter Jean-Michel Basquiat. In 1984, Gallo acted in the No Wave film &quot;The Way It Is or Eurydice in the Avenues&quot; (1985) by Eric Mitchell, along with actors Steve Buscemi, Edwige Belmore, Mark Boone Junior and Rockets Redglare. After starring in the obscure 1989 film &quot;Doc&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;, he began acting in small parts in more well-known films such as &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;, and &quot;The Perez Family&quot;. French director Claire Denis hired Gallo to act in several films such as the short film &quot;Keep It for Yourself&quot;, the made-for-TV &quot;U.S. Go Home&quot;, and its follow-up feature &quot;Nénette et Boni&quot; (1996).&quot; 

In 1998, Gallo released his directorial debut film, &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;. The film received positive critical reception and was nominated for an award for &quot;Best First Feature&quot; at the Independent Spirit Awards. Gallo made this drama for $1.5 million, serving as writer, director, lead actor, and composer/performer of the soundtrack. The release of &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; &quot;gained him a solid fan base.&quot;

During filming, Gallo had difficulties working with actress Christina Ricci, who starred in the film alongside him. According to Ricci, Gallo was a &quot;crazy lunatic man&quot; and did not get along with her on the set. Ricci also said that Gallo mocked her weight several years after the film released, and that she has no interest in ever seeing his other films. Gallo disputes Ricci&#x27;s account, and in 2018, wrote &quot;I still smile when I see a picture of her and when she insults me in the press it reminds me that we are connected in some way, and for that I am grateful. Christina Ricci was my friend during the filming of Buffalo 66 and working with her made sense and felt natural...I insulted her jokingly one day to a friend and a sneaky gossip writer overheard me. Christina and I have not spoken since.&quot;

===2000s===
In 2001, Gallo again collaborated with Denis, and appeared in her horror film &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot;.

In 2003, Gallo starred in and directed the film &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;, which chronicles a motorcycle racer&#x27;s cross-country road trip and co-starred Chloë Sevigny. The film, which contained a scene of Sevigny performing unsimulated oral sex upon Gallo, received an overwhelmingly negative critical response to its Cannes premiere and became a media scandal, in part due to Gallo&#x27;s use of a still image from a sex scene on a promotional billboard. In part, the critical response discussed whether Sevigny had been pressured into performing a sex act by Gallo. Andrea LeVasseur of &quot;Allmovie&quot; said that &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; &quot;premiered to much derision at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert stated that &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; was the worst film in the history of Cannes. Gallo retorted by calling Ebert a &quot;fat pig with the physique of a slave trader&quot; and put a hex on Ebert, wishing him colon cancer. Ebert then responded – adapting a statement made by Winston Churchill – that, &quot;although I am fat, one day I will be thin, but Mr. Gallo will still have been the director of &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;.&quot; In 2003, several media sources later reported that Gallo apologized to Ebert, but Gallo disputed this, saying &quot;I never apologized for anything in my life...The only thing I am sorry about is putting a curse on Roger Ebert&#x27;s colon. If a fat pig like Roger Ebert doesn&#x27;t like my movie then I&#x27;m sorry for him.&quot;

In 2004, Gallo and Ebert appeared to have reconciled, and Ebert ended up giving a thumbs up to a re-edited version of &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;. However, in a 2018 article, written after Ebert&#x27;s death, Gallo accused Ebert&#x27;s review of the re-edited version as being &quot;far fetched and an outright lie.&quot;

Gallo was strongly considered for and almost cast as Uncle Rico in the 2004 film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, though the role ultimately went to Jon Gries.

In 2008, Gallo was cast as the titular character in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s drama film &quot;Tetro&quot; (2009).

===2010s===
In 2010, Gallo won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 67th Venice International Film Festival for his non-speaking role in &quot;Essential Killing&quot;. Gallo did not attend the ceremony to accept his award in person, leaving the duty to the film&#x27;s director Jerzy Skolimowski, who tried to get the actor to reveal himself, leading the audience in a chant of his name. Gallo was not in attendance.

At the festival, Gallo&#x27;s third feature film, &quot;Promises Written in Water&quot;, debuted. It was also screened once at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The film received polarized and mostly negative reviews from critics, though several positive reviews cited it as one of the year&#x27;s greatest films. The film was nominated for the Golden Lion.

Gallo has stated that he has no plans to ever distribute the film and allow it to be seen again, as &quot;I do not want my new works to be generated in a market or audience of any kind.&quot; He also added that allowing the film only ever being shown at two screenings was part of a deal he made with Delfine Bafort, who starred in the film. Gallo explained in a 2011 interview that the film would be &quot;allowed to rest in peace, and stored without being exposed to the dark energies from the public.&quot; As of 2024, &quot;Promises Written in Water&quot; is not available to watch, and has not been screened since 2010.

During the Venice festival, Gallo also released a short film, titled &quot;The Agent&quot;, which was nominated for Best Short Film. &quot;The Agent&quot; starred Sage Stallone, and has also only ever been screened twice, with Gallo having no plans to re-release it to the public.

In 2012, Gallo starred in Davide Manuli&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Kaspar Hauser&quot;, a modern-western interpretation of the German legend of Kaspar Hauser which premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. Gallo plays the two largest roles in the film, the English-speaking Sheriff and the Italian-speaking assassin. Later that year, he appeared in Julie Delpy&#x27;s &quot;2 Days in New York&quot;, in a cameo role as himself. In the film, Gallo appears as a Mephistopheles-like version of himself, who purchases the protagonist&#x27;s (Delpy) soul, after she puts it up for auction. Delpy wrote the role with Gallo specifically in mind, who agreed to the part after reading the screenplay.

In 2013, Gallo&#x27;s website listed that he had directed, written, produced, and acted in his fourth feature film, &quot;April&quot;. It states that the film is 88 minutes long, stars Gallo as the lead character Seth Goldstone, and co-stars pornographic actor Jamie Gillis. The film has never been released, leading to speculation about the nature of the project. That year, Gallo also co-starred with Kōichi Satō and Yoo Ji-tae in Junji Sakamoto&#x27;s film, &quot;Human Trust&quot;.

===2020s===
In 2022, Gallo appeared in D. J. Caruso&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Shut In&quot;. Released by &quot;The Daily Wire&quot;, &quot;Shut In&quot; marked Gallo&#x27;s first acting role since 2013.

In January 2024, it was revealed that Gallo is set to appear alongside actor James Franco in Jordan Gertner&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;The Policeman&quot;, where Gallo will portray serial killer and rapist Joseph James DeAngelo. Gertner previously served as a producer for &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998). &quot;The Policeman&quot; was shot in Portland, and is now in post-production. 

After filming, reports emerged that Gallo was anonymously accused by two actresses, who do not star in the film, of making lewd comments during auditions. Their allegation promoted an investigation by the Screen Actors Guild, who monitored the film&#x27;s production. Gertner and the film&#x27;s production company, Pacific Media Productions, both issued a statement in defense of Gallo. Their statement said that an intimacy coordinator was utilized during filming and that &quot;the production of the picture was carried out in a safe, protective and respectful environment&quot;; while adding that the film&#x27;s cast and crew are &quot;proud of the movie we have made.&quot; 

In October, Franco stated that he was unsure of when &quot;The Policeman&quot; would release, noting that &quot;there is fighting over the cut&quot;.

==Music and modeling career==
===Music===

Gallo played electric bass and sang in the mid-1970s in several adolescent garage bands such as Blue Mood; a progressive rock cover band named Zephyr (not to be confused with the late 1960s band of the same name, or the 1980s Johnny Goudie-fronted band of the same name) which did one performance at Lincoln Park, Tonawanda, New York in 1978; The Good (with Bernie Kugel and Larry Galanowitz); The Detours; and the Plastics. At the age of 16, Gallo moved to New York City and was a later member of the band Gray, with visual artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gray played at clubs such as Max&#x27;s Kansas City, CBGB&#x27;s, Hurrahs, and the Mudd Club. A few of Gray&#x27;s recordings appear on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Downtown 81&quot;.

In 1984, Gallo (using the name &quot;Prince Vince&quot;) also appeared as a dancer on an unsold TV pilot for a hip-hop dance show called &quot;Graffiti Rock&quot;.

Gallo played in a band called Bohack, which recorded an album entitled &quot;It Took Several Wives&quot;. When Bohack disbanded, Gallo turned his attention to acting, directing, and composing in films. He wrote songs for the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Buffalo 66&quot;. He played in a rock band with Lukas Haas called Bunny, and Gallo put out his own album which he wrote, performed and produced under Warp Records, titled &quot;When&quot;.

On August 3, 2013, Vincent Gallo headlined the 3rd Annual San Frandelic Summer Fest in San Francisco.

Gallo directed music videos for the songs &quot;Going Inside&quot; by John Frusciante, and &quot;Anemone&quot; by L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. He also starred in the music videos for &quot;Bitter&quot; by Lit, &quot;Cosmopolitan Bloodloss&quot; by Glassjaw, and &quot;Grounded&quot; by My Vitriol.

In January 2025, Gallo&#x27;s new album, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, is set to be released; Gallo co-created the album with musician Harper Simon. Gallo claims that the album was originally recorded in 2021, but had its release cancelled by Because Music due to his political views. Gallo&#x27;s self-owned label, Family Friend Records, later purchased the rights to the album and finalized its release.

===Modeling===

In 1990, Gallo modeled for Calvin Klein. In 2007, Gallo modeled for Stefano Pilati&#x27;s menswear campaign, and was also photographed for Supreme. In 2009, Gallo appeared as a model in H&amp;M Spring Collection alongside Eva Herzigova. He later did a fashion campaign and photo shoot with G-Star Raw jeans in Fall 2011. In 2017, Gallo modeled glasses for Persol in their Spring/Summer campaign. From 2017 through 2018, Gallo also appeared as a model, photographed in black-and-white, in the Saint Laurent SS18 campaign.

Additionally, Gallo has stated that he once walked in a fashion show for designer Anna Sui, but left her disappointed by his performance, and was never hired by Sui again.

During his childhood, Gallo was close friends with author William S. Burroughs, and lived in Burroughs&#x27; house for six months. Gallo also knew poet John Giorno, who lived with Burroughs at the time. Throughout their lives, Burroughs and Gallo exchanged postcards, letters, and mixtapes. Ohio State University holds one of Gallo&#x27;s letters to Burroughs among its archival collection.

In 1984, Gallo was married to a woman for just 10 weeks, before their relationship ended. Gallo once dated socialite Paris Hilton. Gallo has held close friendships with musician Johnny Ramone (prior to Ramone&#x27;s death in 2004), musician John Frusciante, and actress Milla Jovovich.

On May 24, 2001, Gallo successfully sued actor John Ventimiglia for assault and battery. The New York Supreme Court decided the case in Gallo&#x27;s favor in &quot;Gallo v. Ventimiglia&quot; (2001).

Gallo has garnered infamy for making incendiary and provocative comments. When once asked by an interviewer if he was Jewish, Gallo replied, &quot;No, I do not have the Jew gene.&quot; On his website, Gallo offers himself as an escort to women for $50,000; and sells his sperm for $1,000,000. His website has been labeled as satirical by media outlets such as &quot;The Daily Wire&quot;, and has drawn the scorn of other outlets, such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Gallo has stated in interviews that his website and provocative statements are satire, and has mocked critics who have interpreted them as serious.

===Politics===

Gallo is a lifelong Republican and a conservative. He holds anti-abortion, anti-drug, and anti-pornography views. Gallo once authored an anti-abortion opinion piece in &quot;BlackBook&quot;.

Gallo is a fan of U.S. President Richard Nixon, describing him as an &quot;intellectual&quot;. Gallo claims to have met Nixon when he was six years old, during the time when he lived with Burroughs. 

In 2004, Gallo appeared in the documentary, &quot;Rated R: Republicans in Hollywood&quot;, discussing the political discrimination he has faced in the film industry as a conservative. He also spoke at the Women&#x27;s National Republican Club, where he expressed his support for President George W. Bush, saying that &quot;you know the United States has a great President...when the French hate him!&quot; Later that year, Gallo also met Barbara Bush and Lauren Bush, attending a fashion show alongside them. 

In 2018, Gallo expressed his support for President Donald Trump, writing that he is &quot;extremely proud [Trump] is the American President.&quot; In 2022, he also praised then-Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema as an &quot;open minded and thoughtful&quot; politician, who &quot;adds productive ideological diversity and balance to our beautiful country&quot;; and donated $250 to the campaign of Republican Representative Juan Ciscomani.

In August 2024, Gallo met Trump and endorsed him in the 2024 presidential election; while calling Trump &quot;the greatest president the USA has ever produced.&quot;

===Views on film and music===
In 1998, Gallo listed Pier Paolo Pasolini as his favorite director, and Mauro Bolognini&#x27;s &quot;Il bell&#x27;Antonio&quot; (1960) as his favorite film. In 2009, Gallo instead listed Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969) as his favorite film. He has cited Warren Beatty as one of his favorite actors, as well as his &quot;idol&quot;.

In a 1998 interview with Elvis Mitchell, Gallo explained that his taste in films is &quot;hokey&quot;. He has listed &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; (1976), &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962), &quot;Lilith&quot; (1964), &quot;Mickey One&quot; (1965), &quot;The Ravine&quot; (1969), &quot;The Only Game in Town&quot; (1970), &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot; (1971), &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), &quot;The Death of Richie&quot; (1977), &quot;The Beyond&quot; (1981), and &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; (1999) among his favorite films. In his interview with Mitchell, Gallo also stated that his films are heavily inspired by music, describing &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; as a &quot;pure musical.&quot; Gallo has also expressed a preference for mixing his films with a mono audio track, as opposed to surround sound.

Although a member, Gallo has expressed disdain for the Screen Actors Guild, calling them &quot;a self-serving union that has never had the best intentions of its membership in mind&quot;.

Gallo has cited King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; as his favorite album. He used the album&#x27;s track &quot;Moonchild&quot; during a dance sequence in his film &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;. He has also called the Ramones the greatest band of all time.

==Public reception==
Gallo&#x27;s acting performances have received generally positive reviews from film critics. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised Gallo&#x27;s performance in &quot;Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby&quot; as &quot;ever-eccentric&quot; and &quot;profound&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert frequently praised Gallo&#x27;s performances, including those in &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2004), &quot;Tetro&quot; (2009), &quot;Essential Killing&quot; (2010), and &quot;2 Days in New York&quot; (2012). Gallo&#x27;s performance in &quot;Shut In&quot; (2022) was singled out and praised by Cath Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and John Semley of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, who gave the film itself negative reviews. 

Gallo&#x27;s directional work has received more polarized reception from critics. &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998) received generally positive reviews from critics, and was praised by Ebert, Elvis Mitchell, and Andrew Johnston. Conversely, &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2004) received mixed reviews. Ebert described the initial 119-minute festival cut of the film as the worst film in the history of Cannes, though later praised the 93-minute cut of the film, awarding it 3/4 stars. Moria McDonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, calling it a &quot;self-indulgent and seemingly endless road movie&quot;. Manohla Dargis gave the film a mixed review, describing it as &quot;Neither an atrocity nor a revelation&quot;. &quot;Promises Written in Water&quot; (2010) received mostly negative reviews, including from Leslie Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot;, Deborah Young of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and Xan Brooks of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. It received a mixed review from Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, and a positive one from Truls Lie of &quot;Modern Times Review&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Empire&quot; listed &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998) as the 36th-greatest independent film ever made, calling it a &quot;mini masterpiece&quot;. French cinema magazine &quot;Les Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; voted &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2004) one of the ten best films of the year; while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; listed it as one of the 100 &quot;defining&quot; films of the decade. &quot;Film Comment&quot; also included it among the best unreleased films of 2003, ranking it 14th.

Gallo&#x27;s directorial work has been acclaimed by many within the film industry. &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2004) has been praised by individuals including Jean-Luc Godard, John Waters, Werner Herzog, Sean Penn, Josh Safdie, Claire Denis, and David Lowery. &quot;Promises Written in Water&quot; (2010) was hailed as one of the greatest films of the decade by cinematographer Sean Price Williams. Actor Robert Pattinson has also cited Gallo&#x27;s performance in &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993) as influential on his career.

Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola stated that he was warned against working with Gallo, with many in the film industry describing Gallo as &quot;a nightmare.&quot; Nonetheless, Coppola chose to cast Gallo in &quot;Tetro&quot; (2009), and said that he found Gallo &quot;was very intelligent and a pleasure to work with.&quot; Filmmaker Jerzy Skolimowski praised Gallo&#x27;s performances and described him as a method actor, but stated that he was difficult to direct and prone to anger. Filmmaker Josh Safdie has also said that Gallo is &quot;a genius. One of the smartest people I’ve ever met and known – funniest too&quot;; while filmmaker Caveh Zahedi has written that Gallo is &quot;one of the most talented directors of his generation&quot;. Additionally, actor Kevin Corrigan has described Gallo as &quot;really funny&quot;, while actresses Chloë Sevigny, Julie Delpy, and Courteney Cox have all spoken positively about their experiences working alongside Gallo. Actor Alden Ehrenreich has also praised Gallo as &quot;fascinating&quot;. Conversely, actress Christina Ricci described her experience with Gallo as &quot;working with a crazy lunatic man&quot;, and vowed to never work with him again.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has described Gallo as &quot;rapturous, hilarious, and notoriously acerbic&quot;, while &quot;The Independent&quot; has written that &quot;Gallo may have an ego the size of a hot-air balloon, but even an hour in his company is wildly entertaining.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; has called him a &quot;narcissistic, fantastic director&quot; and said that Gallo &quot;has a reputation as not only one of the most paranoid, controlling men in movies, but also one of the funniest.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; has written that Gallo is &quot;Equally detested and adored&quot;. In 2011, &quot;GQ&quot; included Gallo on their list of &quot;The 25 Most Stylish Directors of All Time&quot;.

Among the general public, Gallo possesses a cult following, mostly relating to his films &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; (2004). Gallo&#x27;s cult following remains especially popular in Japan, having begun shortly after &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; was released in the country in 1999. The Hara Museum of Contemporary Art in Japan featured a survey of Gallo&#x27;s art, titled the &quot;Vincent Gallo Retrospective 1977-2002&quot;, holding roughly 120 paintings, drawings and photographs by Gallo; prior to its closure in 2021.

<text>Peter Hess Stone (February 27, 1930 – April 26, 2003) was an American screenwriter and playwright. Stone is perhaps best remembered by the general public for the screenplays he wrote or co-wrote in the mid-1960s, &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), &quot;Father Goose&quot; (1964), and &quot;Mirage&quot; (1965).

==Early life and career==
===Early life===
Peter Hess Stone was born in Los Angeles to Jewish parents. His mother, Hilda (née Hess), was a film writer, and his father, John Stone (born Saul Strumwasser), was a screenwriter and film producer. Hilda was a Bavarian Jew from Bamberg, but was born in Mexico (her father dodged the draft in the 1870s) and lived there for five years with her family until all foreign nationals were kicked out during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Stone had an older brother David, who was a World War II veteran, serving in the U.S. Navy.

When Stone was 15, his parents took him to see &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot; starring Bobby Clark at the Hazard&#x27;s Pavilion. Stone saw Clark throw his hat onto a hat tree 100 feet away, and, at that moment, knew he wanted to work in theatre.

He graduated from University High School in Los Angeles, Bard College starting in 1947, and earned a master&#x27;s degree from the Yale School of Drama. While at Bard, Stone wrote two plays that were both produced and performed at the school.

===Paris===
After Stone graduated Bard, his mother (still married) eloped to Paris with a Hungarian literary agent (also married) named George Marton. While in Paris, they both settled their divorces and married each other. Stone describes this as &quot;a really great opportunity came to me through what should have been emotionally wrenching, but wasn&#x27;t&quot;, stating that his mother hated Hollywood and was finally happy. After visiting them in the late 1940s, Stone lived in and around Paris for about thirteen years.

Stone worked for CBS while overseas, as a radio writer and newsreader. He also did television features on subjects like the Arc de Triomphe horse race, the Cannes Film Festival and Princess Grace&#x27;s wedding. &quot;I was getting a sentimental education and letting Hollywood rub off me,&quot; he said later. Soon after this, Stone married Mary Hanley.

During this time Stone sold his first script to &quot;Studio One&quot; in 1956, &quot;A Day Before Battle&quot;.

==Broadway and television==
===&quot;Kean&quot;===
In 1953, Stone saw a play by Jean Paul Sartre called &quot;Kean&quot;, adapted from the play by Alexandre Dumas based on the life of Edmund Kean. The Broadway singer and actor Alfred Drake was keen to make &quot;Kean&quot; into a musical, so much so that his agent (who was also Stone&#x27;s agent) became the producer. Stone signed on in December 1960.

On 2 November 1961 &quot;Kean&quot; premiered on Broadway, with music and lyrics by Robert Wright and George Forrest, and Stone as playwright. He was hesitant to write for a musical, even though he loved them and saw them: &quot;I did not see myself as doing that...and then an opportunity arose...I just wanted to be on Broadway&quot;. Stone needed some help, so he consulted Frank Loesser. Stone said of him, &quot;terribly talented, successful and sophisticate man&quot;, when asking Loesser where songs went and other questions about musical structure, and said he was &quot;more than helpful, he was inspiring&quot;. The show only ran for 92 performances and was considered somewhat of a flop, but it helped establish Stone on Broadway.

===Television===
Stone wrote two episodes of the 1961 television series &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (&quot;The Friendly Gesture&quot;, &quot;The Scott Machine&quot;) and three episodes of &quot;The Defenders&quot;. One of his &quot;Defenders&quot; episodes, &quot;The Benefactors&quot;, dealt with abortion care providers and was highly controversial, resulting in sponsors leaving the show. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a remarkable demonstration of the use of theatre as an instrument of editorial protest.&quot; Stone won an Emmy for his script.

He also wrote episodes of &quot;Espionage&quot; (&quot;Covenant with Death&quot;) and &quot;Brenner&quot; (&quot;Laney&#x27;s Boy&quot;, &quot;The Tragic Flute&quot;).

==&quot;Charade&quot; and working for Universal==
Stone&#x27;s first film script was &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), which he turned into a novel at the suggestion of his agent Robert Lantz. Stone said he submitted his original script &quot;everywhere and nobody wanted it&quot;. After it was made into a novel, it was published, and portions of it were even printed before publication in &quot;Redbook&quot;.

Stone sold the script to Stanley Donen, whom he chose because &quot;One, was he was the only person who hadn&#x27;t seen it before and I felt silly selling it to the people who rejected it. Two, It got me out of New York, which at that point I wanted to, I&#x27;d been there a long time with &quot;Kean&quot;. And three, Stanley got stars, and I had written with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in mind&quot;. &quot;I was on the set every day,&quot; Stone remembered, &quot;and I had a marvelous time. There were very few hands involved. It was just Stanley (Donen, the director) and me and the actors, and we all worked it out together. It was an absolutely grand experience.&quot;

Universal who made &quot;Charade&quot; promptly signed Stone to write two more films: &quot;Mirage&quot;, based on a novel by Howard Fast, and &quot;Father Goose&quot; (1964), based on a story by Frank Tarloff, which Stone did at the behest of Cary Grant, who wanted to star.

When &quot;Charade&quot; came out it was a huge success. Stone signed an exclusive five-picture deal with Universal Studios. &quot;Father Goose&quot; was made before &quot;Mirage&quot;. It earned Stone his one and only Oscar for Best Screenplay; he shared it with Tarloff. According to one of his obituaries, &quot;Some felt that the honor was, in part, a delayed tribute for the overlooked &quot;Charade&quot; script.&quot;

Stone&#x27;s work in the 1960s employed Hitchcock-like narratives, even while the director was still an active film maker. Hitchcock&#x27;s influence is especially evident in the Edward Dmytryk-directed &quot;Mirage&quot;, a suspense-mystery that Stone adapted from the Howard Fast novel &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. The narrative has Peck suffering from &quot;unconscious amnesia&quot; while dodging bullets in downtown New York. Although shot in black-and-white, many of its themes and images are reminiscent of &quot;Vertigo&quot;. The cast included Walter Matthau and George Kennedy from &quot;Charade&quot;.

Stone was reunited with Stanley Donen on &quot;Arabesque&quot; which also starred Gregory Peck. Stone was brought on to the film to &quot;trick up the dialogue of somebody else&#x27;s script... so that nobody would notice the film didn&#x27;t make sense.&quot; Stone was unhappy with his low billing and used the pseudonym &#x27;Pierre Marton&#x27; on the credits (literally &#x27;Peter/stone&#x27; in French, plus an homage to his stepfather George Marton).

Stone wrote some scripts which were not made, including &quot;The Expert&quot; (1964) written with Theodore Flicker.

Stone&#x27;s contract with Universal enabled him to continue to write for theatre. He had a minor hit on Broadway with the musical &quot;Skyscraper&quot; (1965–66) with Julie Harris, that went for 248 performances. Stone later called it &quot;A terrific idea, but it never jelled.&quot; &quot;People don&#x27;t know what a book is&quot;, he said later. &quot;They think it&#x27;s the jokes. Well, everybody knows the actors make those up as they go along. A book is a concept and a structure, and dialogue is the smallest part... You can have the best score in the world, but if the book is weak, it won&#x27;t work. On the other hand, if the book is good, it can carry a mediocre score.&quot;

Stone did a pilot for a TV series, &quot;Ghostbreakers &quot; (1967), that was not picked up. He adapted &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1967) for TV, starring Noël Coward and directed by Joe Layton and did the book for a musical, &quot;The Games People Play&quot; with Feuer and Martin, based on the best-selling text book (it ended up not being produced).

&quot;I think I&#x27;ve always had an appetite for a certain kind of urbane comedy&quot;, he said in a 1967 interview. &quot;But I don&#x27;t believe comedy in and of itself is an end.&quot;

Stone wrote a series of films for Universal: &quot;The Secret War of Harry Frigg&quot; (1968), a World War Two comedy with Paul Newman (co written with Tarloff); &quot;Jigsaw&quot; (1968), a mystery with Bradford Dillman; the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969), directed by Bob Fosse, which was an unexpected box office flop; and what ultimately became &quot;Skin Game&quot; (1971).

==&quot;1776&quot;==
Stone wrote the book for the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot; (1969–72) which went for 1,217 performances. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical and Stone won the Drama Desk Award for Best Book.

Stone continued to write scripts at Universal, doing work on &quot;Skin Game&quot; and writing a story about black-white relations that was ultimately never made, &quot;The Ornament&quot;.

He did some uncredited script doctoring on the book for the stage musical &quot;Georgy&quot; (1970), which was credited to Tom Mankiewicz. Then he wrote another musical, &quot;Two by Two&quot; (1970–71) which starred Danny Kaye with songs by Rodgers. It ran for 351 performances.

Stone was unhappy with the changes made to his script for &quot;Skin Game&quot; (1971) (eventually made by Warners), which he said were caused by James Garner, who starred and produced, changing the last third of the film, which Stone wanted to focus on co star Louis Gosset. Stone again used his &quot;Pierre Marton&quot; pseudonym saying &quot;it was the only thing you can do in a situation like that.&quot;

A happier creative experience was the film of &quot;1776&quot; (1972) where he adapted his own book into a screenplay. It was a box office failure.

Stone had another Broadway hit with the book for the musical &quot;Sugar&quot; (1972–73), an adaptation of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, produced by David Merrick and directed by Gower Champion. Stone replaced original book writer George Axelrod. It ran for 505 performances and had a popular life aftwards. Stone later said
&quot;It&#x27;s probably the most successful stock and amateur [property] I&#x27;ve ever done — especially foreign [licensing]. There are two guys everywhere in the world who wanna get in a dress. And this is the one show they can get into a dress without being gay — they&#x27;re on the run! It&#x27;s terribly attractive to two actors, so it&#x27;s constantly done.&quot;

Less successful was the only non-musical he did on Broadway, &quot;Full Circle&quot; (1973) based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque and directed by Otto Preminger. It only ran 21 performances.

==Focus on screenwriting==
Stone returned to TV for a small screen adaptation of the Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy 1949 film, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1973). Stone wrote episodes, including the pilot, and worked as a producer. However the show only had a short run.

He wrote the pilot for &quot;Pat and Mike&quot;, based on another Tracy-Hepburn film, but it was not turned into a series.

Stone wrote the film adaptation of the train hijacking novel &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; (1974). He worked on some scripts that were ultimately not produced including &quot;The Leavenworth Irregulars&quot;, &quot;The Grand Defiance&quot;, and &quot;The Ornament&quot;, as well as a musical that was not made, &quot;Subject to Change&quot;. He did some uncredited doctoring on the show &quot;Goodtime Charley&quot; (1975) and wrote the TV movie &quot;One of My Wives Is Missing&quot; (1976), a thriller starring Jack Klugman, using the Pierre Marton pseudonym again.

Stone wrote the feature films &quot;Silver Bears&quot; (1977), &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot; (1978), with George Segal, and &quot;Why Would I Lie?&quot; (1980) with Treat Williams.

He wrote some unfilmed scripts around this time called &quot;Csardas&quot;, &quot;The Late Great Creature&quot;, and &quot;The Day They Kidnapped Queen Victoria&quot;.

===Return to Broadway===
In 1980, Stone was working on a musical about the Algonquin Round Table but it was not made. Stone returned to Broadway with the book of the musical adaptation of &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1981–83) starring Lauren Bacall which ran for 770 performances. Stone won the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical for his efforts. Also successful was &quot;My One And Only&quot; (1983–85) where Stone wrote the book with the music of George Gershwin. Starring Tommy Tune and Twiggy it went for 767 performances.

Stone wrote the TV movie &quot;Grand Larceny&quot; (1987). In 1988 he wrote &quot;Baby on Board&quot; for &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse&quot;.

Stone did some uncredited script doctoring on the book for the musical &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1989) at the request of director Tommy Tune. He was a writer for The 44th Annual Tony Awards (1990) and The 46th Annual Tony Awards (1992). He wrote the book for &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; (1991–93) which went for 981 performances. It won the Tony for Best musical, and Stone&#x27;s book was nominated.

==Later career==
Stone wrote &quot;Just Cause&quot; (1996), a thriller film starring Sean Connery. He worked on the books for some musicals that were ultimately not made, &quot;Love Me Love My Dog&quot; and a musical with Michael Jackson.

Stone wrote the book for the musical &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997–99) with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston which had a troublesome preproduction period but ultimately ran for 804 performances and swept the Tonys with five wins, including Stone who won a Tony for his book.

&quot;I love it when a show I&#x27;m working on is in trouble&quot;, Stone said around this time. &quot;I&#x27;m an ardent puzzle doer, and I love solving the puzzle of it. I like the process. I don&#x27;t like being in trouble in New York; nothing pleases the theatrical community more than knowing that a show is in trouble. And maybe had they succeeded--and the show was very nearly destroyed by it--it might have been discouraging. But they lost and we won.&quot;

He had given up screenwriting by this time saying &quot;I miss writing them, but I don&#x27;t miss what happens to them after you write them. Stars are now the producers, because they are the motivating force to what gets done--half Jim Carrey&#x27;s salary is the entire budget for &#x27;Titanic&#x27;--and stars don&#x27;t have the slightest clue of how to rewrite anything. It hurts the pictures terribly. Minutes after the script leaves my computer, it&#x27;s best I be put to sleep.&quot;

He said he hoped to write three or four more musicals. &quot;&#x27;The Peter Principle&#x27;--this notion that as soon as you get good at something, you&#x27;re promoted to something you&#x27;re not good at--isn&#x27;t going to work here,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m good at writing book musicals and I&#x27;m going to keep writing them. I know I&#x27;m not going to sit down and write the Great American Play, but I hope to do the Great American Musical. Maybe I&#x27;ve already done it.&quot;

Stone had one last Broadway hit with a 1999 revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, where Stone revised the book. It ran for 1045 performances.

When &quot;Charade&quot; was remade as &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot;, Stone was credited on-screen as &#x27;Peter Joshua&#x27;, one of the names used by Cary Grant in the original film.

===Dramatists Guild presidency===
For 18 years, Stone served as the member-elected president of the Dramatists Guild of America from 1981 to March 24, 1999. He resigned his presidency so a &quot;new crew could take over.&quot;

==Death and postmortem==
Stone died of pulmonary fibrosis on April 26, 2003, in Manhattan, New York. He was survived by his wife, Mary, and brother, David. On February 27, 2004, shortly after his death, he was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Honoring him at the induction ceremony was his close friend, actress Lauren Bacall.

Shortly after Stone&#x27;s death, in a memorial ceremony held June 30, 2003, at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, it was observed that the two most famous ships of all time were Noah&#x27;s Ark and the &quot;Titanic&quot;, and that Stone had written Broadway musicals about both of them (Noah&#x27;s Ark being the topic of &quot;Two by Two&quot;).

===Posthumous===
Stone had a posthumous success on Broadway with &quot;Curtains&quot; (2007–08) based on his original book. It ran for 511 performances.

In 2011, one of his projects was completed with Thomas Meehan, and &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; was produced off-Broadway with a score by Maury Yeston.

Before his death he revised the book to &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; for a planned Broadway production that never made it beyond its tryout, and worked on the musical, &quot;Love Me, Love My Dog&quot; with Jimmy Webb that was never made.

==Awards==
Stone is among the small group of writers who have won acclaim in stage, screen, and television by winning a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy. In 1964, Stone won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his screenplay for &quot;Charade&quot;.

Stone was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical five times (winning for &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;) and for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical three times (winning for &quot;1776&quot; and posthumously for his contribution to &quot;Curtains&quot;).

<text>A skeg (or skegg or skag) is a sternward extension of the keel of boats and ships which have a rudder mounted on the centre line. The term also applies to the lowest point on an outboard motor or the outdrive of an inboard/outboard. In more recent years, the name has been used for a fin on a surfboard which improves directional stability and to a movable fin on a kayak which adjusts the boat&#x27;s centre of lateral resistance (it moves the center of resistance relative to the center of effort). The term is also often used for the fin on water skis in the U.S. It has been used for the vertical fin on seaplane hulls and floats. The wear-bar on the bottom of snowmobile ski may also be called a skeg.

==Etymology==
The word originates in the Scandinavian word for beard; in Old Norse, &quot;skegg&quot;. In Icelandic the word remains &quot;skegg&quot;, in modern Norwegian Bokmål and Nynorsk, it appears as &quot;skjegg&quot;, in Swedish, it is &quot;skägg&quot; and in Danish, &quot;skæg&quot;. The Norwegian pronunciation of the letter combination &quot;skj&quot; is as in the English &quot;sh&quot;. The word is related to the English &quot;shaggy&quot;. It also appears in the English place name Skegness - &#x27;beard point&#x27;, from the way in which a series of tombolos forms, towards the nearby Gibraltar Point. Here, the English pronunciation reflects a probable Danish origin, which pronounces the &quot;sk&quot; letter combination as an English speaker would expect.

==In boats and ships==

Where a vessel&#x27;s rudder is mounted on the centre-line, it is usual to hang it on gudgeons and pintles, the latter being upright pins and the former, rings to fit round them. Together, they form a hinge. This naturally leaves a small gap between the sternpost and the rudder, into which stray items like kelp and rope can catch, causing drag and threatening the security of the vessel&#x27;s steering. In ships such as &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, the skeg is a very small feature; a tapered extension of the keel below the leading edge of the rudder. This somewhat beard-like sternward extension of the keel is the basic skeg. Subsequently, the lowest pintle was commonly mounted below the rudder on a metal extension of the keel. This helped further stabilize and protect the rudder and the name skeg was transferred to it. It used to be relatively small until screw propellers were introduced, when it had to reach below the screw and became a proportionately larger feature protecting both screw and rudder from damage.

On wooden vessels, the skeg may be protected from worm damage by the addition of a bug shoe, or a &quot;a length of hardened material, such as ironbark, placed on the sternward keel extension (skeg) to protect from shipworm damage.&quot;

In more modern installations, with more than one screw, a fitting supports each propeller shaft just ahead of its screw. This is usually called a shaft bracket but the part of it which extends below the shaft bearing to protect the lower part of the propeller is also a skeg. Similarly, the protective projection of the drive casing, below the rotational axis of the propeller of an outboard motor is another form of the skeg.

Where a yacht is designed with a fin keel, it will normally, also have a skeg-mounted rudder.

== Rowing shells ==
A skeg on rowing shells is the fin attached to the keel of the shell that helps stabilize it and maintain a straight course. The rudder attaches to the skeg and is steered by cables attached to it. In select sweeping boats, typically fours and eights, a coxswain will control the rudder, while in sculling boats and some sweeping boats, especially pairs, the rudder will be controlled with toe-steering. A skeg typically consists of a flat piece of metal or plastic. Some crews, like Rutgers Crew, use polished wooden skegs that break off upon impact with debris in order to protect potential damage to the hull of the shell.

==Surfing==

In surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing, skegs, usually known as &quot;fins&quot;, are attached toward the tail of the board to improve directional stability and control through foot-steering. Fins allow the rider to control the board&#x27;s direction by varying their side-to-side weight distribution.

Fixed fins were introduced to surfboards by surfing pioneer Tom Blake in 1935. Around 1936, Woody Brown independently added a fixed fin to his second surfboard design, which further popularized the feature. The stability and control it allowed revolutionized the sport.

Small single aluminum fins first evolved into larger wooden versions, then ones made from fiberglass and carbon fiber. In time, hydrodynamic improvements took place, pioneered by George Downing, who also created the first removable skeg, which was a teak wood skeg in a teak wood box which was supposed to be held in place by the swelling of the wood in water. In modern surfing board design, the conventional set-up is to have three fins, with single fins being a minority. While most windsurfing boards are single-fin, wave boards now feature some twin-fin, tri-fin and quad-fin designs. Directional kitesurfing boards are usually three-fin, with five-fin designs being used for improved upwind performance.

==Kayaks==
A skeg is employed in the type of kayak used on more open water such as the sea. Its purpose and use are rather different from those of the surfing skeg. In the kayak, the amount of exposure of the skeg to the water, and also its effect on the position of the boat&#x27;s centre of lateral resistance (CLR), is freely adjustable by the crew. The adjustment varies the degree to which the wind affects the boat – that is, the amount of lateral movement the wind can cause by impacting the upper parts of the boat and the crew. In more conventional calculations, this would be the centre of effort of the sail area (CE). In still water, where the wind is pushing the boat sideways, a contrary force (lateral resistance) develops, resisting that movement. If the central points of the application of those two forces coincide, the boat moves steadily sideways. Otherwise, it rotates in the horizontal plane, until they are in line. By varying the CLR, it is possible to better control the boat&#x27;s attitude towards the wind and waves. Irregular flowing movement of the water complicates the issue, however. They may be made of wood, fiberglass or aluminum. Some are deployed using internal cables, but others use external ropes and bungee cord.
Typically, these are retractable, and they are not a rudder. If properly configured (e.g., use of street sign aluminum in a narrow box that extends through the hull) they will not flex, and will greatly decrease and counter pitch, roll and yaw, like a centerboard on a sailboat, when the craft is moving. In that sense, the skeg acts as a lifting foil.

==Aircraft==

Skegs have been used to improve the directional stability of seaplanes. They have been installed on floats and hulls.

==Snowmobiles==

The skis on a snowmobile have a metal wear-bar on the bottom of them. Many sledders call these &quot;skegs&quot;. These skegs help the skis to steer on hard surfaces. These often have carbide embedded in them to reduce wear when driven on non-snow surfaces.

<text>Pontifical Gregorian University (; also known as the Gregorian or Gregoriana), is a private pontifical university in Rome, Italy.

The Gregorian originated as a part of the Roman College, founded in 1551 by Ignatius of Loyola, and included all grades of schooling. Its chairs of philosophy and theology received Papal approval in 1556, making it the first institution founded by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). In 1584, the Roman College was given a new home by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom it was renamed the Gregorian University. It had distinguished scholars in ecclesiastical fields as well as in natural science and mathematics. Only the theology and philosophy departments of the Gregorian survived the political turmoil in Italy after 1870.

Today the Gregorian has an international faculty and around 2750 students from over 150 countries.

==History==

===Founding===

Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, established a School of Grammar, Humanities, and Christian Doctrine (&quot;Scuola di grammatica, d&#x27;umanità e di Dottrina cristiana&quot;) in Rome on 18 February 1551. It was located in a building at the base of the Capitoline Hill, on what is today the Piazza d&#x27;Aracoeli. Francis Borgia, the viceroy of Catalonia and a Catholic patron, provided financial support for the new school.

With a small library connected to it, the school was called the Roman College (&quot;Collegio Romano&quot;). In September 1551, due to its increased enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility behind the Santo Stefano del Cacco Church in Rome. After only two years of operation, the Roman College had 250 graduates.

===Early growth===
In January 1556 Pope Paul IV authorized the Roman College to confer academic degrees in theology and philosophy, elevating it to the rank of university. During the following 20 years, ever increasing enrollment forced the college to move to larger facilities twice. During this period, the college added chairs in moral philosophy and Arabic to the existing chairs in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

When the college reached an enrollment of 1000 students, Pope Gregory XIII decided to build it a more expansive facility. He expropriated two city blocks in Rome near the Via del Corso and commissioned the architect Bartolomeo Ammannati to design a new building. The new college building was inaugurated in 1584 in what became known as the Piazza Collegio Romano, across from the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj. In gratitude for Gregory XIII&#x27;s sponsorship, the college administration lauded him as its &quot;founder and father&quot; and renamed the Roman College as the Gregorian University.

The new space at Piazza Collegio Romano allowed the Gregorian University to add chairs of church history and liturgy. The Gregorian soon became known for its work in mathematics, physics and astronomy. Christopher Clavius, then a professor at the Gregorian, developed the Gregorian calendar that is still used worldwide today. The Jesuit mathematician Athanasius Kircher also later taught at the Gregorian. Not long after its Piazza Collegio Romano site opened, the Gregorian had 2000 students. Due to the limited size of its chapel, the Gregorian started rebuilding it in 1626 as the Church of Sant&#x27;Ignazio. Completed in 1650, the church is considered one of the major Baroque churches in the Rome area.
===Modern era===

In 1773, following the suppression of the Society of Jesus throughout Europe, the Jesuits were forced to cede control over the Gregorian University to the Diocese of Rome. But Pope Leo XII returned the Gregorian to Jesuit control on 17 May 1824 after the reestablishment of the Society of Jesus.

With the Capture of Rome in 1870, Rome and the Papal States were incorporated into the new Kingdom of Italy. The new government of Italy then confiscated the Gregorian property and building, converting it into the Ennio Quirino Visconti Liceo Ginnasio. The Gregorian was forced to move into a much smaller facility at the Palazzo Gabrielli-Borromeo on Via del Seminario in Rome. Due to its lack of space, the Gregorian was forced to drop all of its faculties except for theology and philosophy. Enrollment dropped to under 250 students by 1875.

Pope Pius IX later granted the Gregorian the title &quot;Pontifical University&quot;. In 1876, the Faculty of Canon Law was transferred from the University of Rome La Sapienza to the Gregorian, and the university gradually resumed the teaching of other disciplines. After World War I, Pope Benedict XV and his successor, Pope Pius XI, worked to create a new campus for the Gregorian at the base of Quirinal Hill, adjacent to the Pontifical Biblical Institute (&quot;Biblicum&quot;). Pius XI laid the first stone for the new campus on 27 December 1924. Designed by architect Giulio Barluzzi in Neoclassical style, it was completed by 1930. After moving to the new campus, the Gregorian continued to expand to new faculties and disciplines as well as to add new buildings. The Pontifical Institute Regina Mundi, dedicated to the theological formation of women, opened in 1955 and closed in 2005.

==Today==

Today the Gregorian University has some 2750 students from over 150 countries. About 70% of the students are foreign nationals, with 65% of them coming from non-European Union countries. Most students are priests, seminarians, and members of religious orders. After the Second Vatican Council, the first women to earn doctoral degrees at the university were Sandra Schneiders, IHM, and Mary Milligan, RSHM. Both graduates became authorities in New Testament theology and Christian Spirituality.

The Gregorian faculties are doubt 60% Italian and mainly Jesuit priests. In recent years, there has been an increase in laity in both the faculties and the student body; today, diocesan and religious priests represent about 45%, seminarians 25%, lay men and women 22%, and nuns 8% of the student body. Around 1970, the Gregorian discontinued Latin as the principal language of instruction by lecturers and examiners.

Since the Gregorian is a pontifical university, the Holy See accredits its curriculum, and its degrees have full effect in canon law. Its licentiates in philosophy and theology are conferred by some Jesuit universities worldwide, entitling recipients to teach in major seminaries.

With the chirograph of 17 December 2019, Pope Francis decreed that the Pontifical Biblical Institute and the Pontifical Oriental Institute, while retaining their own names and missions, be joined to the Pontifical Gregorian University so as to be part of the same legal entity. The new statutes of the Pontifical Gregorian University with the incorporation of the two pontifical institutes were ratified and approved by the Dicastery for Culture and Education on 11 February 2024, and came into force on 19 May 2024. From 19 May 2024, therefore, the Pontifical Biblical Institute does not have its own rector, being governed by the sole rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, but is represented by a president. By decree of the Minister of the Interior of the Italian Republic dated 28 September 2024, the canonical measure was given civil effect.

=== Allegations of widespread plagiarism ===

According to plagiarism expert Michael Dougherty, there was a &quot;systematic failure to maintain academic integrity at the doctoral level at the Gregorian University in specific disciplines during a relatively recent period.&quot; His 2024 book focused on violations of academic integrity at the famous university from 1995 to 2014, arguing that nine dissertations were severely deficient. Among the works Dougherty analyzes were dissertations submitted by the bishops Paul Kariuki Njiru, Fintan Gavin, and Stephen Robson. Earlier accounts of plagiarism in published doctoral dissertations were documented in review articles in &quot;The Catholic Biblical Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Analecta Cisterciensia&quot;. A special commission of three persons claimed to have found only once instance of plagiarism in Robson&#x27;s thesis; therefore the university took no disciplinary action.
==Academics==
===Gregorian Consortium===
The Gregorian University is one of three member institutes that make up the Gregorian Consortium; the other two institutions are the Pontifical Biblical Institute (founded in 1909) and the Pontifical Oriental Institute (founded in 1917). The Consortium was created under Pope Pius XI, in 1928. The consortium ceased to exist on 19 May 2024, when both of the institutes were absorbed into the Pontifical Gregorian University.

===Academic units===
The University is governed by a single Rector, assisted by the three presidents who promote the fulfilment of the missions of the Pontifical Biblical Institute, the Pontifical Oriental Institute and the Collegium Maximum. The latter body represents the academic units previously established at the Gregorian University. The Pontifical Gregorian University has today ten faculties, three institutes and five centres, all of which offer academic degrees.
* Collegium Maximum:
** Faculty of Theology (&quot;majors:&quot; Biblical Theology, Dogmatic Theology, Fundamental Theology, Moral Theology, Patristic, Comparative Christian Theology, Spiritual Theology, Vocational Theology)
** Faculty of Philosophy (&quot;minors:&quot; Practical Philosophy, Theoretical Philosophy, Philosophy of Religion)
** Faculty of Canon Law (&quot;minors:&quot; Matrimonial Jurisprudence, Penal Jurisprudence)
** Faculty of History and Cultural Heritage of the Church (&quot;majors:&quot; Cultural Heritage of the Church, History of the Church)
** Faculty of Missiology (&quot;minors:&quot; &quot;Missio Ad Gentes&quot;, New Evangelization, Theology of Religions)
** Faculty of Social Sciences (&quot;majors:&quot; Social Communication, Social Doctrine of the Church, Sociology, Leadership and Management)
** Institute of Psychology
** Institute of Anthropology (former Centre for Child Protection)
** Institute of Spirituality
** Centre &quot;Cardinal Bea&quot; for Judaic Studies
** Centre &quot;Saint Peter Favre&quot; for Formators to the Priesthood and Religious Life
** Centre &quot;Alberto Hurtado&quot; for Faith and Culture
** Gregorian Centre for Interreligious Studies
** Ignatian Spirituality Centre
* Pontifical Biblical Institute:
** Faculty of Ancient Near Eastern Studies
** Faculty of Sacred Scriptures
* Pontifical Oriental Institute:
** Faculty of Eastern Canon Law
** Faculty of Eastern Ecclesiastical Sciences (&quot;majors:&quot; History, Liturgy, Patristics)

===Libraries===
The three libraries of the Gregorian Consortium contain nearly 1.2 million volumes, with large collections in the fields of theology, philosophy, culture and literature. The original Roman College library was founded in 1556. In 1872, the Gregorian library&#x27;s 45,000 volumes, manuscripts, and archives were confiscated by the new Italian state; they were dispersed, with some of the collection going to the new Rome National Central Library.

Since 1928 the Gregorian library has been located on the Gregorian campus at Quirinal Hill. The majority of the library&#x27;s collection, 820,000 volumes, is housed in a six-floor tower adjacent to the Palazzo Centrale. An additional 60,000 volumes are housed in the six reading rooms, which together seat 400 students. The library&#x27;s reserve contains many ancient and precious books as well as rare editions, including 80 books from the 16th century.

=== Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University ===
The Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University (APUG) contain Jesuit records from the founding of the Roman College in 1551 to the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773. APUG has over 5,000 manuscripts for teaching rhetoric, grammar, philosophy and theology along with research on Greek and Latin classics, astronomy, mathematics, physics, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Arabic.

Many of the APUG manuscripts were copied by auditores, others are autographs of masters such as Famiano Strada, Christopher Clavius, Francisco Suarez, Roberto Bellarmino, Mutio Vitelleschi, Roger Joseph Boscovich, Juan Bautista Villalpando, Francisco de Toledo. In some cases, these lesson notes gave origin to important works, like the Bellarmino&#x27;s Controversie, of which APUG owns a copy with a lot of handwritten notes by the author. Other important documents at APUG include Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s correspondence, the Christopher Clavius&#x27;s correspondence or the codex used by Francesco Sforza Pallavicino to write his &quot;Istoria del Concilio di Trento&quot;.

Many miscellaneous documents at APUG highlight the relations between the Roman College and many of the Jesuits in mission around the world. These documents provide insight on the Church Reforms, the grace or moral debates, the Jansenist polemic and Chinese rites. APUG also contains documentation about the teaching activity from the 19th century until today: it is the official repository for all the professors who have taught at the Gregorian since 1873. This also includes documents on the First Vatican Council and the Second Vatican Council.

==Gregorian and Biblical Press (1913–2023)==

The GBPress (Gregorian and Biblical Press) was founded, financed, and run by the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. Founded in 1913 and closed in 2023, it printed documents and published periodicals and monographs in most major theological subject areas. Very many of the dissertations accepted by the university were published there.

==Extraterritoriality==
According to Article 16 of the Lateran Treaty, a 1929 agreement between the Government of Italy and the Holy See, the Gregorian University enjoys a certain level of extraterritoriality. According to the treaty, Italy can never subject the university to &quot;charges or to expropriation for reasons of public utility, save by previous agreement with the Holy See.&quot; The Gregorian is also exempt from all Italian tax and is included among those Roman buildings for which the Holy See has the right to deal &quot;as it may deem fit, without obtaining the authorization or consent of the Italian governmental, provincial, or communal authority.&quot;

== Notable alumni and faculty ==


Gregorian&#x27;s alumni include 17 popes, such as Pope Gregory XV, Pope Urban VIII, Pope Innocent X, Pope Clement XI, Pope Leo XIII, Pope Pius XII, Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul I. Eight of the last eleven popes were alumni of the Gregorian. Other students include 72 saints and beatified persons including Saint Robert Bellarmine, Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and Saint Maximilian Kolbe.

<text>The diving ducks, commonly called pochards or scaups, are a category of duck which feed by diving beneath the surface of the water. They are part of Anatidae, the diverse and very large family that includes ducks, geese, and swans.

The diving ducks are placed in a distinct tribe in the subfamily Anatinae, the Aythyini. While morphologically close to the dabbling ducks, there are nonetheless some pronounced differences such as in the structure of the trachea. mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data indicate that the dabbling and diving ducks are fairly distant from each other, the outward similarities being due to convergent evolution.
Alternatively, the diving ducks are placed as a subfamily Aythyinae in the family Anatidae which would encompass all duck-like birds except the whistling-ducks.
The seaducks commonly found in coastal areas, such as the long-tailed duck (formerly known in the U.S. as oldsquaw), scoters, goldeneyes, mergansers, bufflehead and eiders, are also sometimes colloquially referred to in North America as diving ducks because they also feed by diving; their subfamily (Merginae) is a very distinct one however.

Although the group is cosmopolitan, most members are native to the Northern Hemisphere, and it includes several of the most familiar Northern Hemisphere ducks.

This group of ducks is so named because its members feed mainly by diving, although in fact the &quot;Netta&quot; species are reluctant to dive, and feed more like dabbling ducks.

These are gregarious ducks, mainly found on fresh water or on estuaries, though the greater scaup becomes marine during the northern winter. They are strong fliers; their broad, blunt-tipped wings require faster wing-beats than those of many ducks and they take off with some difficulty. Northern species tend to be migratory; southern species do not migrate though the hardhead travels long distances on an irregular basis in response to rainfall. Diving ducks do not walk as well on land as the dabbling ducks; their legs tend to be placed further back on their bodies to help propel them when underwater.

==Systematics==
Three genera are included in the Aythyini. The marbled duck which makes up the monotypic genus &quot;Marmaronetta&quot;, however, seems very distinct and might have diverged prior to the split of dabbling and diving ducks as indicated by morphological and molecular characteristics. The probably extinct pink-headed duck, previously treated separately in &quot;Rhodonessa&quot;, has been suggested to belong into &quot;Netta&quot;, but this approach has been questioned. DNA sequence analyses have found it to be the earliest diverging member of the pochard group. The molecular analysis also suggests that the white-winged duck should be placed into a monotypic genus &quot;Asarcornis&quot; which is fairly close to &quot;Aythya&quot; and might belong into this subfamily.

<text>In biology, a tribe is a taxonomic rank above genus, but below family and subfamily. It is sometimes subdivided into subtribes. By convention, all taxa ranked above species are capitalized, including both tribe and subtribe.

In zoology, the standard ending for the name of a zoological tribe is &quot;-ini&quot;. Examples include the tribes Caprini (goat-antelopes), Hominini (hominins), Bombini (bumblebees), and Thunnini (tunas). The tribe Hominini is divided into subtribes by some scientists; subtribe Hominina then comprises &quot;humans&quot;. The standard ending for the name of a zoological subtribe is &quot;-ina&quot;.

In botany, the standard ending for the name of a botanical tribe is &quot;-eae&quot;. Examples include the tribes Acalypheae and Hyacintheae. The tribe Hyacintheae is divided into subtribes, including the subtribe Massoniinae. The standard ending for the name of a botanical subtribe is &quot;-inae&quot;.

In bacteriology, the form of tribe names is as in botany, e.g., Pseudomonadeae, based on the genus name &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;.

==Rank recognition==
An unfamiliar taxonomic rank cannot necessarily be identified as a tribe merely by the presence of one of the standard suffixes:
* zoological &quot;-ini&quot; uniquely suffixes the animal tribe
* zoological &quot;-ina&quot; uniquely suffixes the animal subtribe
* zoological &quot;-inae&quot; uniquely suffixes the animal subfamily
* botanical &quot;-eae&quot; also suffixes class &quot;-phyceae&quot;, suborder &quot;-ineae&quot;, family &quot;-aceae&quot;, and subfamily &quot;-oideae&quot; (these additional &quot;-eae&quot; ranks are present in bacteria, plants, algae, and fungi, but not animals)

Accordingly, working within animals alone, subfamily &quot;-inae&quot;, tribe -ini, and subtribe &quot;-ina&quot; are unique suffixes to their specific taxonomic ranks. At the other extreme, working within algae alone, &quot;-eae&quot; suffixes class &quot;-phyceae&quot;, suborder &quot;-ineae&quot;, family &quot;-aceae&quot;, subfamily &quot;-oideae&quot;, and tribe &quot;-eae&quot;. The longer suffixes themselves suffixed with &quot;-eae&quot; must first be eliminated before recognizing an unfamiliar &quot;-eae&quot; designation as belonging to rank tribe.

<doc id="217870" wikidata="Q4670673" url="?curid=217870" title="Abuse defense">
<text>The abuse defense is a criminal law defense in which the defendant argues that a prior history of abuse justifies violent retaliation. While the term most often refers to instances of child abuse or sexual assault, it also refers more generally to any attempt by the defense to use a syndrome or societal condition to deflect responsibility away from the defendant. Sometimes the concept is referred to as the abuse excuse, in particular by the critics of the idea that guilty people may use past victimization to diminish the responsibility for their crimes.

When the abuser is the victim of the crime, as is often the case, the abuse excuse is sometimes used as a way to &quot;put the victim on trial&quot;.

The Supreme Court of the United States has held on numerous occasions that the defendant should be permitted to present any information that they feel might affect sentencing. Despite this legal precedent, the availability of the abuse defense has been criticized by several legal experts, particularly in the aftermath of the trials of Lorena Bobbitt and the Menendez brothers. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz has described the abuse excuse as a &quot;lawless invitation to vigilantism&quot;.

== Definition ==
The abuse defense is &quot;the legal tactic by which criminal defendants claim a history of abuse as an excuse for violent retaliation&quot;. In some instances, such as the Bobbitt trial, the supposed abuse occurs shortly before the retaliative act; in such cases, the abuse excuse is raised as a means of claiming temporary insanity or the right of self-defense. In other trials, such as those of the Menéndez brothers, the supposed abuse occurs over a prolonged period of time, often beginning during the defendant&#x27;s childhood; this relates the abuse defense to the concept of diminished capacity. Because the victim of the act is often the person who committed abuse against the defendant in the past, the goal of the abuse excuse is to &quot;put the victim on trial&quot; and show that the abuser &quot;had it coming&quot;.

== Other responsibility deflection defenses ==
There are more than 40 distinct defenses and syndromes that have been employed by defense attorneys, all of which share the goal of deflecting responsibility for the crime away from the defendant. Some of these defenses seek to relate the defendant&#x27;s behavior to previously existing medical conditions, such as antisocial personality disorder, fetal alcohol syndrome, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other defenses seek to attribute the criminal act to the society in which the defendant lives rather than his or her own choices; the pornography defense asserts that the proliferation of pornography causes men to commit acts of sexual violence, and urban survival syndrome claims that violent conditions in a city or neighborhood may justify violent actions by a particular individual.

== Prevalence ==
A growing concern among the American public is that guilty criminals are too often excused for their crimes or are given unsuitably short sentences, a problem that is exacerbated by the use of the abuse defense. Legal experts counter that excuse defenses either serve an insignificant role in the trial or are entirely unsuccessful. During the trial of Dan White, who assassinated gay rights advocates George Moscone and Harvey Milk, one expert testimony mentioned that the consumption of large amounts of junk food may have intensified White&#x27;s state of depression prior to the murders. It was widely reported that White&#x27;s counsel had earned him a reduced sentence by employing the so-called &quot;Twinkie defense&quot;, despite the fact that the subject of sugar intoxication was only briefly touched upon during the trial.

Although the American public often complains about the supposed frequency with which defendants use the abuse defense, the reality is that it is generally only used in high-profile cases. In order for the abuse defense to be employed effectively, it is necessary for the defense to produce expert testimony on the defendant&#x27;s behalf. Most defendants are unable to pay for such testimony; as such, qualified experts tend to provide advocating testimony only in those cases in which the defendant is wealthy or is supported by public interest groups. The trials of Lorena Bobbitt and the Menéndez brothers were two high-profile cases that are often cited as examples of the abuse excuse in action.

=== Bobbitt trial ===

On June 23, 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband&#x27;s penis with a kitchen knife while he was sleeping. Afterward, she drove away and tossed the severed penis out the car window into a nearby field. Bobbitt later claimed that her husband had raped her immediately prior to the incident, though he denied these claims and was eventually acquitted of rape charges. Bobbitt also claimed that her husband had repeatedly raped and verbally abused her in the past, and that the memories of this abuse &quot;raced through her head&quot; in the moments prior to the attack on her husband. At her trial, Bobbitt&#x27;s defense attorney argued that she was not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. She was acquitted by this reason and was released after being taken into custody for psychiatric evaluation. Legal critics argued that Bobbitt won her trial by means of the abuse defense.

=== Menendez brothers ===
In August 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents in their home in Beverly Hills, California. The two constructed an elaborate alibi and maintained their innocence for several years until Erik confessed to his psychotherapist. When it was decided that the murder confession could be used as evidence during their trials, the brothers entered pleas of self-defense. They claimed that they had been sexually abused by their father throughout childhood and that they feared their parents intended to murder them. Despite the judge&#x27;s refusal to present the juries with self-defense instructions, the first trials both ended with hung juries and were declared mistrials. Although the brothers were eventually convicted and given consecutive life sentences, many legal experts were outraged by the mistrials.

== Legal precedent ==
The Supreme Court of the United States has held on numerous occasions that capital defendants have the right to present information about an abusive childhood as mitigating evidence. Prior to 1978, the capital statute of Ohio had placed limitations on what mitigating factors the defense could present during sentencing. However, this statute was invalidated by &quot;Lockett v. Ohio&quot;, in which Chief Justice Warren E. Burger proclaimed that the sentencer should not be &quot;precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant&#x27;s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.&quot; A similar conclusion was reached in the 1982 case &quot;Eddings v. Oklahoma&quot;, in which the Supreme Court held that United States law does not prevent a jury from considering a defendant&#x27;s childhood abuse when determining the appropriate sentence.

In the June 2003 case &quot;Wiggins v. Smith&quot;, the petitioner Kevin Wiggins, who had been sentenced to death for murder, was granted habeas corpus because his attorney had failed to fully investigate or present mitigating evidence regarding Wiggins&#x27;s childhood. Wiggins had been abused and neglected by his mother and was repeatedly raped while in foster care; the Supreme Court determined that there was a &quot;reasonable probability&quot; that such information would have altered the jury&#x27;s sentencing, and that the attorney&#x27;s failure to present this information violated Wiggins&#x27;s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

== Responses ==
Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz has argued that, while a prior history of victimization may be a contributing factor to a violent crime, victimization alone cannot fully explain an act of violence. The vast majority of those who have suffered abuse do not go on to kill their abuser, and there is no known correlation between severity of abuse and the &quot;deadliness of the response&quot;. Dershowitz views the effectiveness of the abuse defense as a &quot;lawless invitation to vigilantism&quot; which will serve only to extend the cycle of violence.

Although political scientist James Q. Wilson has also denounced the abuse excuse, he points out that it is only effective if a jury finds it to be compelling evidence of innocence or a substantial mitigating factor. When this occurs, there is no reason to exclude claims of abuse from the trial proceedings. Wilson has argued that the problem lies not in the employment of excuses as legal defenses, but in the intermingling of social science, which seeks to explain human behavior, with criminal law, which seeks to judge behavior. Although many citizens advocate severe penalties as a means of reducing crime, a number of studies have shown that the juror&#x27;s desire to realize that goal is often overridden by the inherent desire to understand the behavior that leads to crime.

<text>The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), is a Flagship-class space telescope launched aboard the during STS-93 by NASA on July 23, 1999. Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing . Chandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991–2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003–2020). The telescope is named after the Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Its mission is similar to that of ESA&#x27;s XMM-Newton spacecraft, also launched in 1999 but the two telescopes have different design foci, as Chandra has a much higher angular resolution and XMM-Newton higher spectroscopy throughput.

In response to a decrease in NASA funding in 2024 by the US Congress, Chandra is threatened with an early cancellation despite having more than a decade of operation left. The cancellation has been referred to as a potential &quot;extinction-level&quot; event for X-ray astronomy in the US. A group of astronomers have put together a public outreach project to try to get enough American citizens to persuade the US Congress to provide enough funding to avoid early termination of the observatory.

==History==
In 1976, the Chandra X-ray Observatory (called AXAF at the time) was proposed to NASA by Riccardo Giacconi and Harvey Tananbaum. Preliminary work began the following year at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), where the telescope is now operated for NASA at the Chandra X-ray Center in the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian. In the meantime, in 1978, NASA launched the first imaging X-ray telescope, Einstein (HEAO-2), into orbit. Work continued on the AXAF project throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992, to reduce costs, the spacecraft was redesigned. Four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. AXAF&#x27;s planned orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one third of the way to the Moon&#x27;s at its farthest point. This eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair by the Space Shuttle but put the observatory above the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts for most of its orbit. AXAF was assembled and tested by TRW (now Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems) in Redondo Beach, California.

AXAF was renamed Chandra as part of a contest held by NASA in 1998, which drew more than 6,000 submissions worldwide. The contest winners, Jatila van der Veen and Tyrel Johnson (then a high school teacher and high school student, respectively), suggested the name in honor of Nobel Prize–winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is known for his work in determining the maximum mass of white dwarf stars, leading to greater understanding of high energy astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars and black holes. Fittingly, the name Chandra means &quot;moon&quot; in Sanskrit.

Originally scheduled to be launched in December 1998, the spacecraft was delayed several months, eventually being launched on July 23, 1999, at 04:31 UTC by during STS-93. Chandra was deployed by Cady Coleman from &quot;Columbia&quot; at 11:47 UTC. The Inertial Upper Stage&#x27;s first stage motor ignited at 12:48 UTC, and after burning for 125 seconds and separating, the second stage ignited at 12:51 UTC and burned for 117 seconds. At , it was the heaviest payload ever launched by the shuttle, a consequence of the two-stage Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket system needed to transport the spacecraft to its high orbit.

Chandra has been returning data since the month after it launched. It is operated by the SAO at the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with assistance from MIT and Northrop Grumman Space Technology. The ACIS CCDs suffered particle damage during early radiation belt passages. To prevent further damage, the instrument is now removed from the telescope&#x27;s focal plane during passages.

Although Chandra was initially given an expected lifetime of 5 years, on September 4, 2001, NASA extended its lifetime to 10 years &quot;based on the observatory&#x27;s outstanding results.&quot; Physically Chandra could last much longer. A 2004 study performed at the Chandra X-ray Center indicated that the observatory could last at least 15 years. It is active as of 2024 and has an upcoming schedule of observations published by the Chandra X-ray Center.

In July 2008, the International X-ray Observatory, a joint project between ESA, NASA and JAXA, was proposed as the next major X-ray observatory but was later canceled. ESA later resurrected a downsized version of the project as the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA), with a proposed launch in 2028.

On October 10, 2018, Chandra entered safe mode operations, due to a gyroscope glitch. NASA reported that all science instruments were safe. Within days, the 3-second error in data from one gyro was understood, and plans were made to return Chandra to full service. The gyroscope that experienced the glitch was placed in reserve and is otherwise healthy.

In March 2024, Congress decided to reduce funding for NASA and its missions.
This may lead to the premature end of this mission.
In June 2024, Senators urged NASA to reconsider the cuts to Chandra, which was accepted.

==Example discoveries==

The data gathered by Chandra has greatly advanced the field of X-ray astronomy. Here are some examples of discoveries supported by observations from Chandra:
* The first light image, of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, gave astronomers their first glimpse of the compact object at the center of the remnant, probably a neutron star or black hole.
* In the Crab Nebula, another supernova remnant, Chandra showed a never-before-seen ring around the central pulsar and jets that had only been partially seen by earlier telescopes.
* The first X-ray emission was seen from the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, at the center of the Milky Way.
* Chandra confirmed that X-rays in O-type stars are generated through plasma shocks embedded in their wind.
* Chandra found much more cool gas than expected spiraling into the center of the Andromeda Galaxy.
* Pressure fronts were observed in detail for the first time in Abell 2142, where clusters of galaxies are merging.
* The earliest images in X-rays of the shock wave of a supernova were taken of SN 1987A.
* Chandra showed for the first time the shadow of a small galaxy as it is being cannibalized by a larger one, in an image of Perseus A.
* A new type of black hole was discovered in galaxy M82, mid-mass objects purported to be the missing link between stellar-sized black holes and super massive black holes.
* X-ray emission lines were associated for the first time with a gamma-ray burst, Beethoven Burst GRB 991216.
* High school students, using Chandra data, discovered a neutron star in supernova remnant IC 443.
* Observations by Chandra and BeppoSAX suggest that gamma-ray bursts occur in star-forming regions.
* Chandra data suggested that RX J1856.5-3754 and 3C58, previously thought to be pulsars, might be even denser objects: quark stars. These results are still debated.
* Sound waves from violent activity around a super massive black hole were observed in the Perseus Cluster (2003).
* TWA 5B, a brown dwarf, was seen orbiting a binary system of Sun-like stars.
* Nearly all stars on the main sequence are X-ray emitters.
* The X-ray shadow of Titan was seen when it transited the Crab Nebula.
* X-ray emissions from materials falling from a protoplanetary disc into a star.
* Hubble constant measured to be 76.9 km/s/Mpc using Sunyaev-Zel&#x27;dovich effect.
* 2006 Chandra found strong evidence that dark matter exists by observing super cluster collision.
* 2006 X-ray emitting loops, rings and filaments discovered around a super massive black hole within Messier 87 imply the presence of pressure waves, shock waves and sound waves. The evolution of Messier 87 may have been dramatically affected.
* Observations of the Bullet cluster put limits on the cross-section of the self-interaction of dark matter.
* &quot;The Hand of God&quot; photograph of PSR B1509-58.
* Jupiter&#x27;s x-rays coming from poles, not auroral ring.
* A large halo of hot gas was found surrounding the Milky Way.
* Extremely dense and luminous dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 observed.
* On January 5, 2015, NASA reported that CXO observed an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers.
* In September 2016, it was announced that Chandra had detected X-ray emissions from Pluto, the first detection of X-rays from a Kuiper belt object. Chandra had made the observations in 2014 and 2015, supporting the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft for its July 2015 encounter.
* In September 2020, Chandra reportedly may have made an observation of an exoplanet in the Whirlpool Galaxy, which would be the first planet discovered beyond the Milky Way.
* In April 2021, NASA announced findings from the observatory in a tweet saying &quot;Uranus gives off X-rays, astronomers find&quot;. The discovery would have &quot;intriguing implications for understanding Uranus&quot; if it is confirmed that the X-rays originate from the planet and are not emitted by the Sun.

==Technical description==


Unlike optical telescopes which possess simple aluminized parabolic surfaces (mirrors), X-ray telescopes generally use a Wolter telescope consisting of nested cylindrical paraboloid and hyperboloid surfaces coated with iridium or gold. X-ray photons would be absorbed by normal mirror surfaces, so mirrors with a low grazing angle are necessary to reflect them. Chandra uses four pairs of nested mirrors, together with their support structure, called the High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA); the mirror substrate is 2 cm-thick glass, with the reflecting surface a 33 nm iridium coating, and the diameters are 65 cm, 87 cm, 99 cm and 123 cm. The thick substrate and particularly careful polishing allowed a very precise optical surface, which is responsible for Chandra&#x27;s unmatched resolution: between 80% and 95% of the incoming X-ray energy is focused into a one-arcsecond circle. However, the thickness of the substrate limits the proportion of the aperture which is filled, leading to the low collecting area compared to XMM-Newton.

Chandra&#x27;s highly elliptical orbit allows it to observe continuously for up to 55 hours of its 65-hour orbital period. At its furthest orbital point from Earth, Chandra is one of the most distant Earth-orbiting satellites. This orbit takes it beyond the geostationary satellites and beyond the outer Van Allen belt.

With an angular resolution of 0.5 arcsecond (2.4 μrad), Chandra possesses a resolution over 1000 times better than that of the first orbiting X-ray telescope.

CXO uses mechanical gyroscopes, which are sensors that help determine what direction the telescope is pointed. Other navigation and orientation systems on board CXO include an aspect camera, Earth and Sun sensors, and reaction wheels. It also has two sets of thrusters, one for movement and another for offloading momentum.

==Instruments==
The Science Instrument Module (SIM) holds the two focal plane instruments, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) and the High Resolution Camera (HRC), moving whichever is called for into position during an observation.

ACIS consists of 10 CCD chips and provides images as well as spectral information of the object observed. It operates in the photon energy range of 0.2–10 keV. The HRC has two micro-channel plate components and images over the range of 0.1–10 keV. It also has a time resolution of 16 microseconds. Both of these instruments can be used on their own or in conjunction with one of the observatory&#x27;s two transmission gratings.

The transmission gratings, which swing into the optical path behind the mirrors, provide Chandra with high resolution spectroscopy. The High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) works over 0.4–10 keV and has a spectral resolution of 60–1000. The Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) has a range of 0.09–3 keV and a resolution of 40–2000.

Summary:
* High Resolution Camera (HRC)
* Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS)
* High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS)
* Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS)

<text>Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar Galaxy or M82) is a starburst galaxy approximately 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It is the second-largest member of the M81 Group, with the D25 isophotal diameter of . It is about five times more luminous than the Milky Way and its central region is about one hundred times more luminous. The starburst activity is thought to have been triggered by interaction with neighboring galaxy M81. As one of the closest starburst galaxies to Earth, M82 is the prototypical example of this galaxy type. SN 2014J, a type Ia supernova, was discovered in the galaxy on 21 January 2014. In 2014, in studying M82, scientists discovered the brightest pulsar yet known, designated M82 X-2.

In November 2023, a gamma-ray burst was observed in M82, which was determined to have come from a magnetar, the first such event detected outside the Milky Way (and only the fourth such event ever detected).

==Discovery==
M82, with M81, was discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1774; he described it as a &quot;nebulous patch&quot;, this one about degree away from the other, &quot;very pale and of elongated shape&quot;. In 1779, Pierre Méchain independently rediscovered both objects and reported them to Charles Messier, who added them to his catalog.

==Structure==
M82 was believed to be an irregular galaxy. In 2005, however, two symmetric spiral arms were discovered in near-infrared (NIR) images of M82. The arms were detected by subtracting an axisymmetric exponential disk from the NIR images. Even though the arms were detected in NIR images, they are bluer than the disk. The arms had been missed due to M82&#x27;s high disk surface brightness, the nearly edge-on view of this galaxy (~80°), and obscuration by a complex network of dusty filaments in its optical images. These arms emanate from the ends of the NIR bar and can be followed for the length of 3 disc scales. Assuming that the northern part of M82 is nearer to us, as most of the literature does, the observed sense of rotation implies trailing arms.

===Starburst region===
In 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed 197 young massive clusters in the starburst core. The average mass of these clusters is around 200,000 solar masses, hence the starburst core is a very energetic and high-density environment. Throughout the galaxy&#x27;s center, young stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside the entire Milky Way Galaxy.

In the core of M82, the active starburst region spans a diameter of 500 pc. Four high surface brightness regions or clumps (designated A, C, D, and E) are detectable in this region at visible wavelengths. These clumps correspond to known sources at X-ray, infrared, and radio frequencies. Consequently, they are thought to be the least obscured starburst clusters from our vantage point. M82&#x27;s unique bipolar outflow (or &#x27;superwind&#x27;) appears to be concentrated on clumps A and C, and is fueled by energy released by supernovae within the clumps which occur at a rate of about one every ten years.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory detected fluctuating X-ray emissions about 600 light-years from the center of M82. Astronomers have postulated that this comes from the first known intermediate-mass black hole, of roughly 200 to 5000 solar masses. M82, like most galaxies, hosts a supermassive black hole at its center. This one has mass of approximately 3 × 107 solar masses, as measured from stellar dynamics.

===Unknown object===
In April 2010, radio astronomers working at the Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester in the UK reported an object in M82 that had started sending out radio waves, and whose emission did not look like anything seen anywhere in the universe before.

There have been several theories about the nature of this object, but currently no theory entirely fits the observed data. It has been suggested that the object could be an unusual &quot;micro quasar&quot;, having very high radio luminosity yet low X-ray luminosity, and being fairly stable, it could be an analogue of the low X-ray luminosity galactic microquasar SS 433. However, all known microquasars produce large quantities of X-rays, whereas the object&#x27;s X-ray flux is below the measurement threshold. The object is located at several arcseconds from the center of M82 which makes it unlikely to be associated with a supermassive black hole. It has an apparent superluminal motion of four times the speed of light relative to the galaxy center. Apparent superluminal motion is consistent with relativistic jets in massive black holes and does not indicate that the source itself is moving above lightspeed.

==Starbursts==
M82 is being physically affected by its larger neighbor, the spiral M81. Tidal forces caused by gravity have deformed M82, a process that started about 100 million years ago. This interaction has caused star formation to increase tenfold compared to &quot;normal&quot; galaxies.

M82 has undergone at least one tidal encounter with M81 resulting in a large amount of gas being funneled into the galaxy&#x27;s core over the last 200 Myr. The most recent such encounter is thought to have happened around 2–5 years ago and resulted in a concentrated starburst together with a corresponding marked peak in the cluster age distribution. This starburst ran for up to ~50 Myr at a rate of ~10 &quot;M&quot;⊙ per year. Two subsequent starbursts followed, the last (~4–6 Myr ago) of which may have formed the core clusters, both super star clusters (SSCs) and their lighter counterparts.

Stars in M82&#x27;s disk seem to have been formed in a burst 500 million years ago, leaving its disk littered with hundreds of clusters with properties similar to globular clusters (but younger), and stopped 100 million years ago with no star formation taking place in this galaxy outside the central starburst and, at low levels since 1 billion
years ago, on its halo. A suggestion to explain those features is that M82 was previously a low surface brightness galaxy where star formation was triggered due to interactions with its giant neighbor.
Ignoring any difference in their respective distances from the Earth, the centers of M81 and M82 are visually separated by about 130,000 light-years. The actual separation is .

==Supernovae==
As a starburst galaxy, Messier 82 is prone to frequent supernova, caused by the collapse of young, massive stars. The first (although false) supernova candidate reported was SN 1986D, initially believed to be a supernova inside the galaxy until it was found to be a variable short-wavelength infrared source instead.

The first confirmed supernova recorded in the galaxy was SN 2004am, discovered in March 2004 from images taken in November 2003 by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search. It was later determined to be a Type II supernova. In 2008, a radio transient was detected in the galaxy, designated SN 2008iz and thought to be a possible radio-only supernova, being too obscured in visible light by dust and gas clouds to be detectable. A similar radio-only transient was reported in 2009, although never received a formal designation and was similarly unconfirmed.

Prior to accurate and thorough supernova surveys, many other supernovae likely occurred in previous decades. The European VLBI Network studied a number of potential supernova remnants in the galaxy in the 1980s and 90s. One supernova remnant displayed clear expansion between 1986 and 1997 that suggested it originally went supernova in the early 1960s, and two other remnants show possible expansion that could indicate an age almost as young, but could not be confirmed at the time.

===2014 supernova===

On 21 January 2014 at 19.20 UT, a new distinct star was observed in M82, at apparent magnitude +11.7, by astrophysics lecturer Steve Fossey and four of his students, at the University of London Observatory. It had brightened to magnitude +10.9 two days later. Examination of earlier observations of M82 found the supernova to figure on the intervening day as well as on 15 through 20 January, brightening from magnitude +14.4 to +11.3; it could not be found, to limiting magnitude +17, from images caught of 14 January. It was initially suggested that it could become as bright as magnitude +8.5, well within the visual range of small telescopes and large binoculars, but peaked at fainter +10.5 on the last day of the month. Preliminary analysis classified it as &quot;a young, reddened type Ia supernova&quot;. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has designated it SN 2014J. SN 1993J was also at relatively close distance, in M82&#x27;s larger companion galaxy M81. SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud was much closer. 2014J is the closest type Ia supernova since SN 1972E.

<doc id="217885" wikidata="Q3429822" url="?curid=217885" title="Rhyme Pays">
<text>Rhyme Pays is the debut studio album by American rapper Ice-T, released on July 28, 1987, by Sire Records. The album peaked at number 93 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 23 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

== Music and lyrics ==
The album, especially tracks like &quot;6 &#x27;N the Morning&quot;, is considered to have defined the gangsta rap genre. Ice-T claims that this would be his first hip hop album to be carrying a parental advisory warning label, although, it was years before the industry-standard explicit-lyrics sticker was developed and Too $hort&#x27;s first album that also had to be carried with an &quot;Explicit Lyrics&quot; warning back in 1985. The 1988 CD release included four bonus tracks.

Ice-T stated on his autobiography that Seymour Stein took the exception to the song &quot;409&quot; for the line &quot;Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy/If a guy wants a guy, please take it outside&quot;, which he saw as homophobic. Ice-T insisted that those lines were not meant to be homophobic, but simply a statement of his own preferences. An article by Dennis Hunt noted that this lyric &quot;may rub gays the wrong way&quot; in an interview on the album&#x27;s release. Ice-T would later become one of the first hardcore rappers to condemn homophobia.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave &quot;Rhyme Pays&quot; a &quot;B&quot; and credited DJ Afrika Islam for helping flesh out Ice T&#x27;s crime-themed raps: &quot;Can&#x27;t know whether his streetwise jabs at Reagan and recidivism will make a permanent impression on his core audience, but his sexploitations and true crime tales are detailed and harrowing enough to convince anybody he was there.&quot; According to AllMusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson, &quot;the West Coast was well on its way to becomining a crucial part of hip-hop&quot; when &quot;Rhyme Pays&quot; was released. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Dennis Hunt said the album helped popularize gangsta rap.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Rhyme Pays&quot; debuted at number 93 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums charts. It also became the first hip-hop album to be released on Sire and Warner Bros. Records. The album was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="217886" wikidata="Q963740" url="?curid=217886" title="The Lady of Rage">
<text>Robin Yvette Allen (born February 6, 1968), known professionally as The Lady of Rage, is an American rapper, singer and actress best known for her collaborations with several other Death Row Records artists, including Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg on the seminal albums, &quot;The Chronic&quot; and &quot;Doggystyle&quot;. The Lady of Rage has been described as &quot;one of the most skillful female MCs&quot; with a &quot;mastery of flow&quot; and &quot;hard-core lyrics&quot;.

==Biography==

In the summer of 1988, the Lady of Rage was 20 years old when she met Shahkim, now known as Black Rushn of the Original Outlaw Brothers, a rap group from Queens, New York. Once Shahkim convinced the Lady of Rage that he could get her a record deal, he brought her into his group. The members of the Outlaw Brothers made Rage a member of the group, and they eventually signed to a production deal with the L.A. Posse (who went on to produce several big hits for LL Cool J). At the time, the L.A. Posse had several artists within their group including, MC Wind, and the Real Roxanne. The L.A. Posse also had several relationships with different labels. Rage, along with all of the artists in the camp worked diligently writing and recording out of Chung King Studios in lower Manhattan. In 1991, the Lady of Rage met with Chubb Rock, providing vocals for the track &quot;Bring Em Home Safe&quot; on his album &quot;The One&quot;, which she recorded under the name of &#x27;Rockin’ Robin&#x27;.

Dr. Dre discovered the Lady of Rage after hearing the vocals she recorded for the L.A. Posse&#x27;s album, &quot;They Come in All Colors&quot; (1991). She later appeared on several tracks on Dr. Dre&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;The Chronic&quot;, and on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot; in 1993.

On July 26, 1994, the Lady of Rage released the hit single &quot;Afro Puffs&quot; (from the soundtrack to &quot;Above the Rim&quot;) which reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles chart. She also made an appearance on Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s album &quot;Dogg Food&quot; on the track &quot;Do What I Feel&quot;. Though she had made more than a dozen appearances on soundtracks as well as albums from her Death Row Records cohorts, the Lady of Rage didn&#x27;t release her debut album until 1997. Her debut solo album, &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot;, was released in June 1997 and peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Album chart and 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums chart. Her solo album was originally called &quot;Eargasm&quot;, but it was continually pushed back - the album was meant to have been the next album on Death Row Records after &quot;The Chronic&quot;, and then after &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, before finally being released in 1997.

After the release of her album and a guest-appearance with Gang Starr alongside Kurupt (&quot;You Know My Steez (Three Men and a Lady Remix)&quot;) in 1998, Rage left Death Row Records and the music industry to focus on acting, appearing in an episode of &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;. The Lady of Rage then went on to be featured in the sitcom &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; on The WB as Coretta Cox, a recurring role she played from 1997 to 2000. She also had a role in &quot;Next Friday&quot; as Baby D, the sister of Day Day&#x27;s ex-girlfriend.

From 2000 to 2002, she made three appearances on songs by Snoop Dogg: &quot;Set It Off&quot; from his album &quot;Tha Last Meal&quot; (2000), a solo track, &quot;Unfucwitable&quot;, on &quot;Snoop Dogg Presents...Doggy Style Allstars Vol. 1&quot; (2002), and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, from his album &quot;Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss&quot; (2002).

In 2007, Rage signed to Shante Broadus&#x27; label, Boss Lady Entertainment, and recorded a mixtape called, &quot;From VA 2 LA&quot;. She also made appearances on &quot;Bigg Snoop Dogg Presents…Welcome to tha Chuuch: Da Album&quot; (2005) and &quot;Cali Iz Active&quot; (2006) in the song &quot;&quot;Keep it Gangsta&quot;.&quot;

In 2008, Rage was a part of the FEM (Females Earning Money) Movement along with fellow female rappers Babs (of Da Band), Lady Luck, and Amil. In 2008, she performed with MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, and Salt-n-Pepa at the BET Hip Hop Awards. In the summer of 2010 she joined Snoop Dogg during his headlining set at the Rock the Bells festival concert series, along with Warren G, RBX, and Tha Dogg Pound for a performance of the &quot;Doggystyle&quot; album in its entirety.

In 2011, Rage was part of the group N&#x27;Matez, along with Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, and RBX. They released the track &quot;Trajical&quot;.

Rage signed on to play herself in &quot;Dogg Pound 4 Life&quot;, a biographical film focusing on the rise of the 1990s rap group, Tha Dogg Pound and was pictured in an Instagram post with Daz Dillinger.

Rage also made an appearance on MC Eiht&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Which Way Iz West&quot; on the track &quot;Heart Cold&quot;.

<text>Anthony H. Forté (born March 2, 1968), better known by his stage name Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay, is an American rapper from San Francisco, California.

==Early life==
Anthony Forte was born March 2, 1968, and grew up in San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore District. He has a twin sister. He has a son as well as three daughters.

==Music career==
Right after high school, 4-Tay made his debut on the Too Short album &quot;Life Is...Too Short&quot;. He was later convicted on drug charges and served ten months in prison. Upon his release from prison he released his debut album &quot;Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay Is Back&quot; in 1991, and followed up in 1994 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight the Feelin&#x27;&quot;, which included the hits &quot;Playaz Club&quot; (which sampled the song &quot;Private Number&quot; by William Bell and Judy Clay and hit number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), the &quot;Dank Season&quot; featuring Seff Tha Gaffla, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot; (which hit number 39 on the US Hot 100, number 59 in Australia, and number one in New Zealand ).

In 1995, two Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay songs—&quot;Problems&quot; and &quot;A Message for Your Mind&quot;—were featured on the &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; soundtrack. &quot;A Message For Your Mind&quot; sampled &quot;I Want You Back&quot; by The Jackson 5.

Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay&#x27;s mainstream success has been scarce since then, but he was featured on 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; album on the track &quot;Only God Can Judge Me&quot; in 1996 and Master P&#x27;s &quot;West Coast Bad Boyz II&quot; compilation in 1997. 4-Tay was also an original member of Bay Area supergroup T.W.D.Y. in 1999.

In 2003 Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay released the album &quot;Gangsta Gumbo&quot; with the single &quot;Burning, Burning&quot;, followed up by the album &quot;That&#x27;s What You Thought&quot; in 2007. In 2010 He was featured on R&amp;B Artist E. Broussard&#x27;s song titled Big Game Droppin&#x27;.

He was featured on the song &quot;My Alphabets&quot; on fellow Bay Area rap veteran Mac Dre&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;The Genie of the Lamp&quot;. 
Dec 06 2011 Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay, E-40 and Playalitical collaborated on a song entitled &quot;Bounce It Like a Bad Check&quot; which was featured on the &quot;Political Playboy Music&quot; album released by Playalitical. In 2012 Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay collaborated on the song &quot;Picture a Nigga&quot; with Lil&#x27; Gang$ta, as well as helping with his debut album.

In 2013, he headlined the main stage of Seattle Hempfest with artists Ditch, Tony Tag, Brian Meyers and more.

In May 2014, he appeared with E Bone415 in a music video about Alcatraz Island.

==&quot;Playaz Club&quot; controversy==

In 2014, 4-Tay spoke out against Drake for using lyrics from 4-Tay&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Playaz Club&quot; in the collaboration &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; with YG. The artists settled out of court with 4-Tay being promised $100,000 and future credits for the song. However, it was later revealed that Drake had not actually paid 4-Tay the $100,000.

4-Tay eventually received royalties for his contributions to &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;. In 2018, the royalties to both the YG single and &quot;Playaz Club&quot; were auctioned on Royalty Exchange and at one time had bids of upward of $38,250 with the seller reportedly being 4-Tay.

<doc id="217912" wikidata="Q4177072" url="?curid=217912" title="Name days in Sweden">
<text>This is the old Swedish [[name day]] calendar, sanctioned by the Swedish Academy in 1901, with official status until 1972. Some days still refer to traditional or religious feasts rather than personal names. Some of the names below are linked to the original saints or martyrs from which they originate. A work group, consisting of the Swedish Academy, publishers and others, agreed to adopt a new name day list in 2001, very similar to the old one but with more names. It is intended that this list will be updated every 15 years. In the year of 2022 seven new names will be added.

In Sweden, it is not uncommon for people to celebrate their name day.

The tradition originated with the Calendar of Saints.

<doc id="217913" wikidata="Q190128" url="?curid=217913" title="Hạ Long Bay">
<text>Hạ Long Bay or Halong Bay (, ) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and popular travel destination in Quảng Ninh province, Vietnam. The name Hạ Long means &quot;descending dragon&quot;. Administratively, the bay belongs to Hạ Long city, Cẩm Phả city, and is a part of Vân Đồn district. The bay features thousands of limestone karsts and islets in various shapes and sizes. Hạ Long Bay is a center of a larger zone that includes Bai Tu Long Bay to the northeast, and Cát Bà Island to the southwest. These larger zones share a similar geological, geographical, geomorphological, climate, and cultural characters.

Hạ Long Bay has an area of around , including 1,969 islets, most of which are limestone. The core of the bay has an area of with a high density of 775 islets. The limestone in this bay has gone through 500 million years of formation in different conditions and environments. The evolution of the karst in this bay has taken 20 million years under the impact of the tropical wet climate. The geo-diversity of the environment in the area has created biodiversity, including a tropical evergreen biosystem and a seashore biosystem. Hạ Long Bay is home to 14 endemic floral species and 60 endemic faunal species.

Historical research surveys have shown the presence of prehistoric human beings in this area tens of thousands years ago. The successive ancient cultures are the Soi Nhụ culture around 18,000–7,000 BC, the Cái Bèo culture 7,000–5,000 BC and the Hạ Long culture 5,000–3,500 years ago. Hạ Long Bay also marked some important events in Vietnamese history, with many artifacts found in Bài Thơ mountain, Đầu Gỗ cave, and Bãi Cháy.

Nguyễn Trãi praised the beauty of Hạ Long Bay 500 years ago in his verse , in which he called it &quot;a rock wonder in the sky&quot;. In 1962, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of North Vietnam listed Hạ Long Bay in the National Relics and Landscapes publication. In 1994, the core zone of Hạ Long Bay was listed as a World Heritage Site under Criterion VII, and was listed for a second time under Criterion VIII.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hạ Long&quot; (chữ Hán: 下龍) means &quot;descending dragon&quot;.

Before the 19th century, the name Hạ Long Bay had not been recorded in the old books of the country. It has been called other names such as An Bang, Lục Thủy, and Vân Đồn. In the late 19th century, the name Hạ Long Bay appeared on the Maritime Map of France. The French-language &quot;Hai Phong News&quot; reported &quot;Dragon appears on Hạ Long Bay&quot;.

According to local legend, when Vietnam had just started to develop into a country, they had to fight against invaders. To assist the Vietnamese in defending their country, the gods sent a family of dragons as protectors. This family of dragons began spitting out jewels and jade. These jewels turned into the islands and islets dotting the bay, linking together to form a great wall against the invaders. Under magics, numerous rock mountains abruptly appeared on the sea, ahead of invaders&#x27; ships; the forward ships struck the rocks and each other. After winning the battle, the dragons were interested in peaceful sightseeing of the Earth, and then decided to live in this bay. The place where the mother dragon descended was named Hạ Long, the place where the dragon&#x27;s children attended upon their mother was called &quot;Bái Tử Long&quot; island (&quot;Bái&quot;: attend upon, &quot;Tử&quot;: children, &quot;Long&quot;: dragon), and the place where the dragon&#x27;s children wriggled their tails violently was called &quot;Bạch Long Vĩ&quot; island (&quot;Bạch&quot;: white-color of the foam made when Dragon&#x27;s children wriggled, &quot;Long&quot;: dragon, &quot;Vĩ&quot;: tail), present-day Tra Co peninsula, Móng Cái.

==Overview==

The bay consists of a dense cluster of some 1,600 limestone monolithic islands each topped with thick jungle vegetation, rising spectacularly from the ocean. Several of the islands are hollow, with enormous caves. Hang Dau Go (Wooden Stakes cave) is the largest grotto in the Hạ Long area. French tourists visited in the late 19th century, and named the cave &quot;Grotte des Merveilles&quot;. Its three large chambers contain large numerous stalactites and stalagmites (as well as 19th-century French graffiti). There are two bigger islands, Tuần Châu and Cát Bà, that have permanent inhabitants, as well as tourist facilities including hotels and beaches. There are a number of beautiful beaches on the smaller islands.
A community of around 1,600 people live on Hạ Long Bay in four fishing villages: Cua Van, Ba Hang, Cong Tau and Vong Vieng in Hung Thang ward, Hạ Long city. They live on floating houses and are sustained through fishing and marine aquaculture (cultivating marine biota), plying the shallow waters for 200 species of fish and 450 different kinds of mollusks. Many of the islands have acquired their names as a result of their unusual shapes. Such names include Voi Islet (elephant), Ga Choi Islet (fighting cock), Khi Islet (monkey), and Mai Nha Islet (roof). 989 of the islands have been given names. Birds and land animals including bantams, antelopes, monkeys, and lizards also live on some of the islands.
Almost all these islands are as individual towers in a classic fenglin landscape with heights ranging from , and height/width ratios of up to about six.

Another specific feature of Hạ Long Bay is the abundance of lakes inside the limestone islands. For example, Dau Be island has six enclosed lakes. All these island lakes occupy drowned dolines within fengcong karst.

===Location===
Hạ Long Bay is located in northeastern Vietnam, from E106°55&#x27; to E107°37&#x27; and from N20°43&#x27; to N21°09&#x27;. The bay stretches from Quang Yen town, past Hạ Long city, Cẩm Phả city to Vân Đồn District, is 
bordered on the south and southeast by Lan Ha Bay, on the north by Hạ Long city, and on the west by Bai Tu Long Bay. The bay has a coastline and is approximately in size with about 2,000 islets. The area designated by UNESCO as the World Natural Heritage Site incorporates with 775 islets, of which the core zone is delimited by 69 points: Dau Go island on the west, Ba Ham lake on the south and Cong Tay island on the east. The protected area is from the Cái Dăm petrol store to Quang Hanh ward, Cẩm Phả city and the surrounding zone.

===Climate===
The climate of the bay is tropical, wet, sea islands, with two seasons: hot and moist summer, dry and cold winter. The average temperature is from , and annual rainfall is between . Hạ Long Bay has the typical diurnal tide system (tide amplitude ranges from ). The salinity is from 31 to 34.5MT in the dry season and lower in the rainy season.

===Population===
Of the 1,969 islands in Hạ Long, only approximately 40 are inhabited. These islands range from tens to thousands of hectares in size, mainly in the East and Southeast of Hạ Long Bay. In recent decades, thousands of villagers have been starting to settle down on the pristine islands and build new communities such as Sa Tô Island (Hạ Long City) and Thắng Lợi Island (Vân Đồn district).

The population of Hạ Long Bay is about 1,540, mainly in Cửa Vạn, Ba Hang and Cặp Dè fishing villages (Hùng Thắng Ward, Hạ Long City). Residents of the bay mostly live on boats and rafts buoyed by tires and plastic jugs to facilitate the fishing, cultivating and breeding of aquatic and marine species. Fish require feeding every other day for up to three years, when they are eventually sold to local seafood restaurants for up to 300,000 Vietnamese dong per kilogram. Today, the lives of Hạ Long Bay inhabitants have much improved due to new travel businesses. Residents of the floating villages around Hạ Long Bay now offer bedrooms for rent, boat tours, and fresh seafood meals to tourists. While this is an isolating, back-breaking lifestyle, floating village residents are considered wealthy compared to residents of other Hạ Long Bay islands.

At present , the Quảng Ninh provincial government has a policy to relocate the households living in the bay to resettle, in order to stabilize their life and to protect the landscape of the heritage zone. More than 300 households living in fishing villages in Hạ Long Bay have been relocated ashore in Khe Cá Resettlement Area, now known as Zone 8 (Hà Phong Ward, Hạ Long City) since May 2014. This project will continue to be implemented. The province will only retain a number of fishing villages for sightseeing tours.

==History==
===Soi Nhụ culture (16,000–5000 BC)===
Located within Hạ Long and Bái Tử Long are archaeological sites such as Mê Cung and Thiên Long. There are remains from mounds of mountain shellfish (Cyclophorus), spring shellfish (Melania, also called Thiana), some freshwater water mollusc and some rudimentary labour tools. The main way of life of Soi Nhụ&#x27;s inhabitants included catching fish and shellfish, collecting fruits and digging for bulbs and roots. Their living environment was a coastal area unlike other Vietnamese cultures, for example, those found in Hòa Bình and Bắc Sơn.

===Cái Bèo culture (5000–3000 BC)===
Located in Hạ Long and Cát Bà island its inhabitants developed to the level of sea exploitation. Cái Bèo culture is a link between Soi Nhụ culture and Hạ Long culture.

===Hạ Long culture (2500–1500 BC)===

=== Classical period ===

Hạ Long Bay was the setting for historical naval battles against Vietnam&#x27;s coastal neighbors. On three occasions, in the labyrinth of channels in Bạch Đằng River near the islands, the Vietnamese army stopped the Chinese invaders from landing. In 1288, General Trần Hưng Đạo stopped Mongol ships from sailing up the nearby Bạch Đằng River by placing steel-tipped wooden stakes at high tide, sinking the Mongol Kublai Khan&#x27;s fleet.

=== Modern period ===

Hạ Long Bay was the site of the first ever raising of the new national flag of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam on 5 June 1948 during the signing of the Halong Bay Agreements (&quot;Accords de la baie d’Along&quot;) by High Commissioner Emile Bollaert and President Nguyễn Văn Xuân.

During the Vietnam War, many of the channels between the islands were heavily mined by the United States Navy, some of which continue to pose threats to shipping routes in the present day.

==Geology and geomorphology==

In 2000, UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Committee inscribed Hạ Long Bay in the World Heritage List according to its outstanding examples representing major stages of the Earth&#x27;s history and its original limestone karstic geomorphologic features. Hạ Long Bay and its adjacent areas consist of a part of the Sino-Vietnamese composite terrane having its development history from pre-Cambrian up to present day. During Phanerozoic, terrigenous, volcanogenic and cherty-carbonate sediments containing in abundance graptolites, bivalves, brachiopods, fishes, foraminiferans, corals, radiolarias, and flora, separated from one from another by 10 stratigraphic gaps, but the boundary between Devonian and Carboniferous has been considered as continuous. The limestone karstic geomorphology of the bay has developed since the Miocene, especially the cone-shaped hills (fengcong), or isolated high limestone karst towers (fenglin) with many remnants of old phreatic caves, old karstic foot caves, and marine notch caves forming magnificent limestone karst landforms unique to the world. The Quaternary geology was developed through 5 cycles with the intercalation of marine and continental environments. The present Hạ Long Bay, in fact, appeared after the Middle Holocene maximum transgression, leaving ultimate zone of lateral undercutting in the limestone cliffs bearing many shells of oysters, having the 14C age as 2280 to &gt;40,000 y. BP. Geological resources are abundant, including anthracite, petroleum, lignite, phosphate, oil shale, limestone and cement additives, kaolin, silica sand, dolomite, quartzite of exogenous origin, antimony, and mercury of hydrothermal origin. Additionally, there is surface water, groundwater and thermal mineral water on the shore of the Hạ Long – Bái Tử Long Bays, as well as other environmental resources.

In terms of marine geology, this area is recorded as an especially coastal sedimentary environment. In the alkaline seawater environment, the chemical denudation process of calcium carbonate proceeds rapidly, creating wide, strangely shaped marine notches.

The bottom surface sediments are various from clay mud to sand, however, silty mud and clay mud dominate in distribution. Especially, the carbonate materials originated from organisms make up 60 to 65% sedimentary content. The surface sediments of coral reefs are mainly sand and pebbles, of which the carbonate materials account for more than 90%. The intertidal zone sediments are various, from clay mud to sand and gravel, depending on distinguished sedimentary environments such as mangrove marshes, tidal flats, beaches etc. At the small beaches, the sand sediments may be dominated quartz or carbonate materials.

The sediment layers of the intertidal zone, the upper sea bed with a plain surface conserving ancient rivers, the systems of caves and their sediments, traces of ancient marine action forming distinctive notches, beaches and marine terraces, and mangrove swamps are important evidence of geological events and processes taking place during the Quaternary Period.

===Karst geomorphology value===

Due to a simultaneous combination of ideal factors such as thick, pale, grey, and strong limestone layers, which are formed by fine-grained materials; hot and moist climate and slow tectonic process as a whole; Hạ Long Bay has had a complete karst evolution for 20 million years. There are many types of karst topography in the bay, such as karst field.

Hạ Long Bay is a mature karst landscape developed during a warm, wet, tropical climate. The sequence of stages in the evolution of a karst landscape over a period of 20 million years requires a combination of several distinct elements including a massive thickness of limestone, a hot wet climate and slow overall tectonic up lift. The process of karst formation is divided into five stages, the second of which is the formation of the distinctive do line karst. This is followed by the development of fengcong karst, which can be seen in the groups of hills on Bo Hon and Dau Be Inland. These cones with sloping sides average 100m in height with the tallest exceeding 200m. Fenglin karst is characterized by steep separate towers. The hundreds of rocky islands that form the beautiful and famous landscape of the Bay are the individual towers of a classic Fenglin landscape where the intervening plains have been submerged by the sea. Most towers reach a height of between 50 and 100m with a height to width ratio of about 6. The karst dolines were flooded by the sea, becoming the abundance of lakes that lie within the limestone islands. For example, Dau Be island at the mouth of the Bay has six enclosed lakes including those of the Ba Ham lakes lying within its fengcong karst. The Bay contains examples of the landscape elements of fengcong, fenglin and karst plain. These are not separate evolutionary stages but the result of natural non – uniform processes in the denudation of a large mass of limestone. Marine erosion created the notches which in some places have been enlarged into caves. The marine notch is a feature of limestone coastline but, in Hạ Long Bay, it has created the mature landscape.

Within Hạ Long Bay, the main accessible caves are the older passages that survive from the time when the karst was evolving through its various stages of fengcong and fenglin. Three main types of caves can be recognized in the limestone islands (Waltham, T. 1998):
*Remnants of old phreatic caves
*Old karstic foot caves
*Marine notch caves
The first group consists of old phreatic caves which include Sung Sot, Tam Cung, Lau Dai, Thien Cung, Dau Go, Hoang Long, Thien Long. Nowadays, these caves lie at various heights. Sung Sot cave is on Bo Hon Island. From its truncated entrance chambers on a ledge high on the cliff, a passage of more than 10m high and wide descends to the south. Tam Cung is a large phreatic fissure cave that developed in the bedding planes of the limestone dividing the fissure cave into three chambers. Lau Dai is a cave with a complex of passages extending over 300 meters on the south side of Con Ngua Island. Thien Cung and Dau Go are remnants of the same old cave system. They both survive in the northern part of Dau Go Island at between 20 and 50m above sea level. Thien Cung has one large chamber more than 100m long, blocked at its ends and almost subdivided into smaller chambers by a massive wall of stalactites and stalagmites. Dau Go is a single large tunnel descending along a major set of fractures to a massive choke.

The second group of caves is the old karstic foot caves which include Trinh Lu, Bo Nau, Tien Ong and Trong caves. Foot caves are a ubiquitous feature of karst landscapes which have reached a stage of widespread lateral undercutting at base level. They may extend back into maze caves of stream caves draining from larger cave systems within the limestone. They are distinguished by the main elements of their passages being close to the horizontal and are commonly related to denuded or accumulated terraces at the old base levels. Trinh Nu, which is one of the larger foot caves in Hạ Long Bay with its ceiling at about 12m above sea level and about 80m in length, was developed in multiple stages. Bo Nau, a horizontal cave containing old stalactite deposits, cuts across the 25o dip of the bedding plane.

The third group is the marine notch caves which&#x27;re a special feature of the karst of Hạ Long Bay. The dissolution process of sea water acting on the limestone and erosion by wave action creates notches at the base of the cliffs. In advantageous conditions, dissolution of the limestone allows the cliff notches to be steadily deepened and extended into caves. Many of these at sea level extend right through the limestone hills into drowned dolinas which are now tidal lakes.

A distinguishing feature of marine notch caves is an absolutely smooth and horizontal ceiling cut through the limestone. Some marine notch caves had not been not formed at present sea level, but old sea levels related to sea level changes in Holocene transgression, event to Pleistocene sea levels. Some of them preserved the development of old karstic foot caves in mainland environments or preserved the remnants of older phreatic caves. One of the most unusual features of Hạ Long Bay is the Bo Ham lake group of hidden lakes and their connecting tunnel – notch caves in Dau Be Island. From the island&#x27;s perimeter cliff a cave, 10m wide at water level and curving so that it is almost completely dark, extends about 150m to Lake 1. Luon Cave is on Bo Hon Island and extends 50m meters to an enclosed tidal lake. It has a massive stalactite hanging 2m down and truncated at the modern tidal level. It has passed through many stages in its formation.

The karst landscape of Hạ Long Bay is of international significance and of fundamental importance to the science of geomorphology. The fenglin tower karst, which is the type present in much of Hạ Long Bay, is the most extreme form of limestone landscape development. If these karst landscapes are broadly compared in terms of their height, steepness and number of their limestone towers, Hạ Long Bay is probably second in the entire world only to Yangshuo, in China. However, Hạ Long Bay has also been invaded by the sea so that the geomorphology of its limestone islands are, at least in part, the consequence of marine erosion. The marine invasion distinguishes Hạ Long Bay and makes it unique in the world. There are other areas of submerged karst towers which were invaded by the sea, but none is as extensive as Hạ Long Bay.

===Timeline of geologic evolution===
Some of the most remarkable geological events in Hạ Long Bay&#x27;s history have occurred in the last 1,000 years, include the advance of the sea, the raising of the bay area, strong erosion that has formed coral, and, pure blue and heavily salted water. This process of erosion by seawater has deeply engraved the stone, contributing to its fantastic beauty. Present-day Hạ Long Bay is the result of this long process of geological evolution that has been influenced by so many factors.

Due to all these factors, tourists visiting Hạ Long Bay are not only treated to one of the natural wonders of the world, but also to a precious geological museum that has been naturally preserved in the open air for the last 300 million years.

==Ecology==
Two ecosystems coexist in Ha Long Bay: a tropical, moist, evergreen rainforest ecosystem and a marine and coastal ecosystem. Livistona halongensis, Impatiens halongensis, Chirita halongensis, Chirita hiepii, Chirita modesta, Paraboea halongensis, and Alpinia calcicola are among the seven endemic species found in the bay. There is also some bioluminescent plankton.

The many islands that dot the bay are home to a great many other species, including (but likely not limited to): 477 magnoliales, 12 pteris, 20 salt marsh flora; and 4 amphibia, 10 reptilia, 40 aves, and 4 mammalia.

Common aquatic species found in the bay include: cuttlefish (&quot;mực&quot;); oyster (&quot;hào&quot;); cyclinae (&quot;ngán&quot;); prawns (penaeidea (&quot;tôm he&quot;), panulirus (&quot;tôm hùm&quot;), parapenaeopsis (&quot;tôm sắt&quot;), etc.); sipunculoideas (&quot;sá sùng&quot;); nerita (&quot;ốc đĩa&quot;); charonia tritonis (&quot;ốc tù và&quot;); and &quot;cà sáy&quot;. A new species of sponge, &quot;Cladocroce pansinii&quot;, was discovered in underwater caves attached to the bay in 2023.

===Environmental damage===

With an increasing tourist trade, mangroves and seagrass beds have been cleared and jetties and wharves have been built for tourist boats.

Game fishing, often near coral reefs, is threatening many endangered species of fish.

Local government and businesses are aware of the problems and many measures have been taken to minimise the impact of tourism on the bay environment for sustainable economic growth like introducing eco-friendly tours and tight waste control on resorts.

==Awards and designations==
In 1962, the Vietnam Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism designated Hạ Long Bay a &#x27;Renowned National Landscape Monument&#x27;.

Hạ Long Bay was first listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, in recognition of its outstanding, universal aesthetic value. In 2000, the World Heritage Committee additionally recognised Hạ Long Bay for its outstanding geological and geomorphological value, and its World Heritage Listing was updated.

In October 2011, the World Monuments Fund included the bay on the 2012 World Monuments Watch, citing pressure from tourism and associated developments as threats to the site that must be addressed.

In 2012, the New 7 Wonders Foundation officially named Hạ Long Bay as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature.

Hạ Long Bay is also a part of the Club of the Most Beautiful Bays of the World.

==Popular culture==
===Literature===
In writings about Hạ Long Bay, the following Vietnamese writers wrote:
* Nguyễn Trãi: &quot;This wonder is ground raising up into the middle of the high sky&quot;.
* Xuân Diệu: &quot;Here is the unfinished works of the Beings...Here is the stones which the Giant played and threw away&quot;.
* Nguyên Ngọc: &quot;...to form this first- rate wonder, nature only uses: Stone and Water...There are just only two materials themselves chosen from as much as materials, in order to write, to draw, to sculpture, to create everything...It is quite possible that here is the image of the future world&quot;.
* Ho Chi Minh: &quot;It is the wonder that one cannot impart to others&quot;.
* Phạm Văn Đồng: &quot;Is it one scenery or many sceneries? Is it the scenery in the world or somewhere?&quot;.
* Nguyễn Tuân: &quot;Only mountains accept to be old, but Hạ Long sea and wave are young forever&quot;.
* Huy Cận: &quot;Night breathes, stars wave Hạ Long&#x27;s water&quot;.
* Chế Lan Viên:
&quot;Hạ Long, Bái Tử Long - Dragons were hidden, only stones still remain
On the moonlight nights, stones meditate as men do...&quot;
Lord Trịnh Cương overflowed with emotion: &quot;Mountains are glistened by water shadow, water spills all over the sky&quot;.

===Ancient tales===

The inhabitants of the bay and its adjacent city have transmitted numerous ancient tales explaining names given to various isles and caves in the bay.
* Đầu Gỗ cave (&quot;the end of wooden bars&quot; cave): these wooden bars in this cave are the remnants of sharped wooden columns built under the water level by the order of Trần Hưng Đạo commander in order to sink Mongolian invaders&#x27; ships in the 13th century.
* Kim Quy cave (&quot;Golden Turtle&quot; cave): it is told that the Golden Turtle swam toward the Eastern Sea (international name: South China Sea) after returning the holy sword which had assisted King Lê Thái Tổ in the combat against Ming invaders from China. Next, with the approval of the Sea King, Golden Turtle continued to fight against monsters in this marine area. The turtle became exhausted and died in a cave. Consequently, the cave was named after the Golden Turtle.
* Con Cóc islet (Frog islet): a frog-like isle. According to ancient tales, in a year of severe drought, a frog directed all animals to the Heaven and protested against the God. They demonstrated in favour of making rain. As a result, the God must accept the frog as his uncle. Since then, whenever frogs grind their teeth, the God has to pour water down the ground.
* Hang Trống and Hang Trinh Nữ (Male cave and Virgin cave): the tale&#x27;s about a beautiful woman had fallen in love with a fisherman whom must sail to the sea not so long after their engagement, the landlord saw this beautiful girl and captured her, but with her resistance, the landlord exiled the girl to remote island. After being left to starve, the girl died and turned into a statue people called Hang Trinh Nữ (Virgin Cave). Her betrothed ran to the girl&#x27;s island and when he found out what had happened, he turned into an islet situated nearby called Hang Trống (Male cave).
* Thiên Cung cave (literally: Paradise cave): this cave is one of the places associated with the ancient dragon king. It told that Thiên Cung cave was the place where the Dragon King&#x27;s seven-day marriage took place. To congratulate the couple, many dragons and elephants visited to dance and fly.

== Conservation Issues ==
=== Impacts of Human and Natural Factors on the Bay Area ===
Ha Long, Hai Phong, and Hanoi are significant urban centers driving the economic development in northern Vietnam. The economic growth in these urban areas, coupled with the rapid rise of the southern regions in China, including Hong Kong, have led to increasing human pressures on Ha Long Bay. The coastal areas of Quang Ninh province and Hai Phong City have experienced rapid growth in infrastructure development, particularly in transportation, shipping, coal mining, and tourism-related industries. Since 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has warned that constructing new ports in the Hạ Long Bay area could lead to increased maritime traffic in the region, posing threats to the bay&#x27;s infrastructure and the social infrastructure supporting tourism. Pollution from industrial waste, overexploitation, and overfishing also pose significant threats. Some argue that there is a need for cautious consideration of development in the bay area through effective management structures, given its crucial environmental significance for the entire region.

Currently, the expansion of urban areas and population growth, construction of ports and factories, tourism and service activities, household and industrial waste, fishing and aquaculture practices, have not only become threats but have also caused alarming levels of environmental pollution and landscape changes in Ha Long Bay. Due to pollution, the once thriving coral reefs in the deep sea of Ha Long Bay are deteriorating. The formerly clear waters of the bay are increasingly becoming turbid and sedimented, prompting scientists to warn of the possibility of Ha Long Bay becoming &quot;swamped.&quot; Additionally, as Ha Long Bay is surrounded by thousands of limestone islands, which are mostly good construction materials, they are susceptible to private exploitation, leading to landscape distortion.

On another aspect, global climate change with rising sea levels will strongly impact the landscape, island systems, caves, and biodiversity of Ha Long Bay. Vietnam currently lacks the necessary human and material resources to adequately respond to these challenges.

In terms of community culture, an issue that many International tourism have complained about is the lack of environmental awareness among both tourists and local communities. The modern, civilized, and courteous image of Ha Long tourism has not been fully established as desired. There are still instances of beggars harassing tourists, which affects the tourism environment of the heritage site. Efforts in education and propaganda to raise awareness among the local population, restrictions on resort development on islands, and the implementation of eco-tourism standards and heritage conservation regulations for the surrounding waters of the heritage site are significant challenges for the local government. The stalactites in the cave system of Ha Long Bay have been vandalized, cut, and taken away for use in decorating artificial landscapes (2016). Some caves have even been covered with concrete to serve as banquet venues. Moreover, the activities of fishing boats and tourists also generate significant amounts of waste pollution that the authorities have yet to effectively manage.

=== Conservation Efforts ===
In an effort to prevent the negative impact of human activities on the natural environment of Ha Long Bay, the authorities of Quang Ninh province have prohibited high-speed motorboats serving tourists in the bay area to protect the environment and biodiversity. Additionally, the province has relocated fishing households living on floating villages to the mainland to protect the water environment of Ha Long Bay. Furthermore, the extraction of coal and stone within the heritage area has been banned to prevent coal and mud pollution in the bay as advised by UNESCO. In the bay area, some local residents have voluntarily taken action to preserve the landscape by organizing volunteer groups to collect and handle waste. Starting from September 1, 2019, the People&#x27;s Committee of Ha Long City strictly banned the use of single-use plastic products in the bay area. This is a resolute and significant step towards conserving the bay&#x27;s environment.

The similarity in landscape, geology, biodiversity, as well as cultural and archaeological values of the entire region, including not only Ha Long Bay but also Cat Ba Archipelago and Bai Tu Long Bay, has led to scientific research in geology, archaeology, culture, and tourism, as well as fishing activities, extending beyond the boundaries of Ha Long Bay. Some experts suggest considering the expansion of the conservation area, not only limiting it to the small area of Ha Long Bay but also encompassing the surrounding sea area, including the areas close to the Vietnam-China border. With a length of about 300 km and a width of about 60 km, the entire area can be seen and conserved as a unique marine ecosystem of Vietnam.

<doc id="217914" wikidata="Q784221" url="?curid=217914" title="Rote learning">
<text>Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. The method rests on the premise that the recall of repeated material becomes faster the more one repeats it. Some of the alternatives to rote learning include meaningful learning, associative learning, spaced repetition and active learning.

== Versus critical thinking ==
Rote learning is widely used in the mastery of foundational knowledge. Examples of school topics where rote learning is frequently used include phonics in reading, the periodic table in chemistry, multiplication tables in mathematics, anatomy in medicine, cases or statutes in law, basic formulae in any science, etc. By definition, rote learning eschews comprehension, so by itself it is an ineffective tool in mastering any complex subject at an advanced level. For instance, one illustration of rote learning can be observed in preparing quickly for exams, a technique which may be colloquially referred to as &quot;cramming&quot;.

Rote learning is sometimes disparaged with the derogative terms &quot;parrot fashion&quot;, &quot;regurgitation&quot;, &quot;cramming&quot;, or &quot;mugging&quot; because one who engages in rote learning may give the wrong impression of having understood what they have written or said. It is strongly discouraged by many new curriculum standards. For example, science and mathematics standards in the United States specifically emphasize the importance of deep understanding over the mere recall of facts, which is seen to be less important. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics stated: More than ever, mathematics must include the mastery of concepts instead of mere memorization and the following of procedures. More than ever, school mathematics must include an understanding of how to use technology to arrive meaningfully at solutions to problems instead of endless attention to increasingly outdated computational tedium.However, advocates of traditional education have criticized the new American standards as slighting learning basic facts and elementary arithmetic, and replacing content with process-based skills. In math and science, rote methods are often used, for example to memorize formulas. There is greater understanding if students commit a formula to memory through exercises that use the formula rather than through rote repetition of the formula. Newer standards often recommend that students derive formulas themselves to achieve the best understanding. Nothing is faster than rote learning if a formula must be learned quickly for an imminent test and rote methods can be helpful for committing an understood fact to memory. However, students who learn with understanding are able to transfer their knowledge to tasks requiring problem-solving with greater success than those who learn only by rote.

On the other side, those who disagree with the inquiry-based philosophy maintain that students must first develop computational skills before they can understand concepts of mathematics. These people would argue that time is better spent practicing skills rather than in investigations inventing alternatives, or justifying more than one correct answer or method. In this view, estimating answers is insufficient and, in fact, is considered to be dependent on strong foundational skills. Learning abstract concepts of mathematics is perceived to depend on a solid base of knowledge of the tools of the subject. Thus, these people believe that rote learning is an important part of the learning process.

== In computer science ==

Rote learning is also used to describe a simple learning pattern used in machine learning, although it does not involve repetition, unlike the usual meaning of rote learning. The machine is programmed to keep a history of calculations and compare new input against its history of inputs and outputs, retrieving the stored output if present. This pattern requires that the machine can be modeled as a pure function — always producing same output for same input — and can be formally described as follows:

:f(formula_1) → (formula_2) → store ((formula_1),(formula_4))

Rote learning was used by Samuel&#x27;s Checkers on an IBM 701, a milestone in the use of artificial intelligence.
== Learning methods for school ==
The flashcard, outline, and mnemonic device are traditional tools for memorizing course material and are examples of rote learning.

<doc id="217916" wikidata="Q1872987" url="?curid=217916" title="Constructive vote of no confidence">
<text>The constructive vote of no confidence (, ) is a variation on the motion of no confidence that allows a parliament to withdraw confidence from a head of government only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor. The principle is intended to ensure governments&#x27; stability by making sure that a replacement has enough parliamentary support to govern.

The concept was introduced on a national scale in West Germany&#x27;s 1949 constitution, which remains in force after the German reunification; it has been adopted since the 1970s in other nations like Spain, Hungary, Lesotho, Israel, Poland, Slovenia, Albania, and Belgium.

==Germany==

Governments in the post-WW1 Weimar Republic were very unstable. Since the only election threshold for the Reichstag was that a party had to have received at least 30,000 votes in a single district, it was possible to get a seat with as little as 0.1 percent of the vote (&quot;e.g.,&quot; People&#x27;s Justice Party in July 1932). This resulted in a fragmented parliament, making it difficult for a government to retain a majority. Furthermore, as the German Empire had not been a parliamentary system, the politicians who had served in the pre-war Reichstag had little experience with coalition governments, which were an absolute necessity given the fractured political landscape. The parties representing the political center-left – the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Centre Party and Progressive People&#x27;s Party – had come together for the Reichstag Peace Resolution during World War I and had experience with cross-party cooperation through the Inter-Party Committee (:de:Interfraktioneller Ausschuss), but those efforts were directed &quot;against&quot; the government of the emperor and chancellor, not the work of a coalition of parties supporting a government agenda with difficult Realpolitik considerations. The three parties made up what was called the Weimar Coalition and formed four of the early cabinets under the new Weimar Constitution. Especially from 1925 on, however, Germany was governed by center-right coalitions that included the German People&#x27;s Party (monarchist and thus opposed to the Weimar Coalition in 1919) as well as the Centre Party and the center-left German Democratic Party, with either the Social Democrats or the far right German National People&#x27;s Party joining the coalitions or providing confidence and supply to a minority government.

===Background: No-confidence motions prior to 1949===

Under the German Empire (1871–1918), the chancellor was appointed or dismissed exclusively by the emperor, leaving the Reichstag with no formal mechanism of removing the chancellor, and therefore pressuring them. When Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg had drawn the ire of the Reichstag majority over his handling of the Zabern Affair, they passed a vote of censure against him, but the Emperor wanted him to stay, and the Reichstag had no recourse in the matter. The Weimar National Assembly that wrote the Weimar constitution explicitly inserted a provision that the chancellor needed the confidence of the Reichstag. The constitution also contained a strong Reich president who was authorized to appoint and remove the chancellor (Article 53). A Weimar Republic chancellor thus needed the support of both the president and the Reichstag and neither needed to present a workable alternative when the chancellor was dismissed. This proved especially problematic after the 1925 German presidential election made Paul von Hindenburg president. He was a strongly conservative monarchist who frequently clashed with and tried to undermine the SPD, the party that held the most seats in the Reichstag from 1919 to 1932. In the less than 14 years of the Republic, there was a succession of 14 Chancellors with 20 governments. All of the transitions under Reich President Friedrich Ebert of the SPD (in office 1919 to 1925) were made collegially with the cooperation of the Reichstag. Under Ebert, however, the emergency provisions of Article 48, which allowed the Reich president to take emergency measures without the prior consent of the Reichstag, was used 136 times, frequently to deal with political violence and economic emergencies. It was only after 1925 that the use of Article 48 led to the imposition of cabinets dependent on the confidence of the president, Paul von Hindenburg. The instability was helped by and seen as contributing to the rise of the Nazi Party. After the 1930 German Reichstag election there was no longer any workable government majority due to the Communist Party of Germany (then holding on to the social fascism thesis and thus unwilling to form a popular front government) and the Nazi party holding 184 out of 577 seats between them and frequently cooperating on motions to disrupt procedures and hamper the government. After the July 1932 German Reichstag election, the Nazis and Communists combined had 319 out of 605 seats, giving them the power to vote down any motion and dismiss the government through a vote of no confidence without being able (or willing) to propose any constructive measures of their own.

The Free State of Prussia (by far Germany&#x27;s largest and most populous) had a slightly different constitutional setup which required a &quot;positive&quot; majority in favor of a &quot;new&quot; government to unseat the sitting government. Otto Braun of the Social Democrats served as Prime Minister of Prussia from 1920 until the 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état with only two interruptions, providing much more democratic stability in Prussia than at the Reich level.

===Legislative framework in 1949 constitution===

To prevent the type of instability seen on the Reich level during the Weimar Republic and taking a cue from the Prussian model, two provisions were included in the 1949 German constitution, the Basic Law () They stipulate that &quot;Bundeskanzler&quot; (Federal Chancellor), as the function is now called, may be removed from office by majority vote of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; (&quot;Federal Diet&quot;, the German Federal Parliament) only if a prospective successor also has the support of a majority:

: Article 67. (1) The Bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the Federal Chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the Federal President to dismiss the Federal Chancellor. The Federal President must comply with the request and appoint the person elected.
: (2) Forty-eight hours must elapse between the motion and the election.

: Article 68. (1) If a motion of a Federal Chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the Bundestag, the Federal President may, upon the proposal of the Federal Chancellor, dissolve the Bundestag within twenty-one days. The right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the Bundestag with the majority of its members elects another Federal Chancellor.
: (2) Forty-eight hours must elapse between the motion and the vote thereon.

As a result, the failure of a motion of confidence does not automatically force either the resignation of the cabinet or a new election. Rather, the cabinet &quot;may&quot; continue as a minority government if there is not a positive majority for a prospective successor. At the same time, the Bundestag can&#x27;t be dissolved unless a motion of no confidence has passed; this was meant as a way to prevent the incumbent Chancellor from strategically calling a new election (such as when the party or coalition they belong to is higher in the polls). Indeed, a dissolution is allowed only after the cabinet has formally lost parliamentary support.

This mechanism of triggering early elections was used three times at the federal level, in 1972 after Willy Brandt narrowly survived an attempt to unseat him, in 1983 after Helmut Kohl wished to cement his ascension via constructive vote of no confidence (the FDP had switched from supporting Helmut Schmidt and the SPD to backing Kohl and the CDU/CSU two years after the 1980 German federal election) and in 2005 when Gerhard Schröder wished to obtain a new mandate from the electorate in the face of falling poll numbers, criticism from members of his own party and the loss in the 2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election (a state his party had governed since 1966). While president Horst Köhler at first hesitated to grant Schröder&#x27;s request to dissolve the Bundestag, he ultimately did so and the German Federal Constitutional Court refused to undo Köhler&#x27;s action as it deemed the issue a political question tacitly endorsing the new convention.

For a motion of no confidence, a majority of all Bundestag members is needed to elect a new chancellor, so not participating in the vote has the same effect as voting &quot;no&quot; (or abstaining). This was of importance in the first, ultimately unsuccessful use of this instrument.

Also, the Federal President may dissolve the legislature &quot;only&quot; after the failure of a motion of confidence, and the legislature may not dissolve itself either. This provision is intended to limit the power of the President. One consequence of this is that in contrast to many other parliamentary democracies, the Chancellor does not petition the President to dissolve the legislature. Rather, a Chancellor needs to (deliberately) lose a motion of confidence in order to force a snap election.

While Carlo Schmid is generally considered the main contributor to this constitutional innovation, the concept was actually introduced after World War I in the Free State of Prussia. It was a major reason why Prussia was governed by a stable centre-left coalition without interruption from 1919 to 1932 in contrast to the instability of the national governments.

=== History of use ===
Since 1949, two constructive votes of no confidence have been attempted (both by CDU against SPD), and only the second was successful.


====1972: Rainer Barzel vs. Willy Brandt (failed vote)====

On 27 April 1972, an attempt to oust Chancellor Willy Brandt (SPD) in favour of opposition leader Rainer Barzel (CDU) failed by only two votes. This came as a surprise since it was known that several members of the SPD-FDP coalition strongly opposed Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; and the government no longer had a clear majority after several deputies either switched over to the opposition or announced they would vote for the no-confidence motion. The numerous defections theoretically dropped the coalition to just 246 votes. The opposition nominally had 250, one vote over the 249 needed to topple Brandt.

The voting was influenced by tactics. The law on specifies that the Chancellor is elected in a secret ballot, which applies in the motion of no confidence as well. To hamper their &quot;faithless&quot; deputies from voting for Barzel, the leadership of the SPD urged them not to participate in the vote; since a majority of all deputies is needed for a successful vote, not participating has the same effect as voting &quot;no&quot;, and it can be checked or enforced unlike secret ballot. Only the members of government and a few protesting coalition deputies (several from FDP, only Günter Müller from SPD) went to the voting booth, the first to ensure that dissenting deputies from CDU might remain secret.

Despite this, Brandt believed he was finished, and the SPD had girded itself to be consigned to opposition. A number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt&#x27;s defeat. In the end, only 260 votes were cast: 247 with yes, 10 with no, 3 abstaining; the remaining 236 were either absent or invalid. It was thus clear that the missing votes were within the CDU faction. In June 1973, CDU member Julius Steiner admitted to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine to have abstained from voting. Later, he claimed to have received 50,000 DM in return from one of the leading SPD figures, Karl Wienand. Leo Wagner of the CSU was suspected to have received a bribe as well, but conclusive evidence could not be found. After the 1990 German reunification, it became clear that the bribe money that was offered to several CDU politicians came from the East German Stasi (secret police), who at the time saw a need for Brandt to stay in power. That is somewhat ironic since Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; is today seen as one of the major steps that eventually led to the implosion of East Germany in 1989. Brandt in turn would resign only two years later over the Guillaume affair which involved one of his personal assistants having been a Stasi spy.

However, as the government was no longer backed by a majority in parliament, on 22 September, Chancellor Brandt proposed a Motion of confidence to the &quot;Bundestag&quot;. He lost intentionally to make way for the 1972 West German federal election in November, which he won decisively.

====1982: Helmut Kohl vs. Helmut Schmidt (successful vote)====
On 1 October 1982, Helmut Schmidt was voted out of office in favor of Helmut Kohl, marking the end of the SPD-FDP coalition. The vote was much easier than the 1972 one since it was clear that the FDP wanted to switch over to the CDU. Indeed, the FDP was already in negotiations at the time the vote happened. The FDP was no longer content with SPD economic policy and at the same time, the SPD was internally divided over NATO stationing of nuclear missiles in Germany. Still, the vote succeeded by a majority of only seven votes.

To obtain a clearer majority in the &quot;Bundestag&quot; (which seemed to be in reach according to the polls), after the vote, Helmut Kohl put up a motion of confidence in which the new CDU-FDP coalition intentionally voted against the Chancellor that it just put into power. This trick allowed for the dissolution of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; according to Article 68 of the &quot;Grundgesetz&quot; (see above). Still, the action triggered an appeal by four deputies to the Federal Constitutional Court, which, in a somewhat helpless ruling that February, upheld the move. The court emphasized this was only acceptable if the Chancellor has reason to believe he cannot continue to effectively govern with the current balance of power. It decided Kohl could believe this since the FDP was not only deeply divided by the change of coalition but had already agreed to early elections, meaning in theory that it no longer had to support the government. The new &quot;Bundestag&quot; was elected in March 1983, yielding a strong majority for the new coalition, which eventually lasted until 1998.

==Spain==

A very similar system to the German one was adopted in the new Constitution of Spain of 1978 for the national Cortes (parliament) and also came into force in territorial assemblies (parliaments/assemblies of autonomous communities). Despite Spanish constitutional history being very different from that of Germany (and Spain deciding to have the monarchy protected by an entrenched clause while Germany had been a Republic since 1919), the German Basic Law was seen as &quot;success model&quot; at the time and this is just one of several provisions the framers of the Spanish constitution lifted wholesale from the German model. Some, like the equivalent of the controversial Article 155 of the Spanish constitution which deals with Federal execution have never been used in practice in Germany.

The Prime Minister of Spain (President of the Government) must resign if he proposes a vote of confidence to the Congress of Deputies (the lower chamber of the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot;, Spanish parliament) and is defeated, or alternatively, if the Congress censures the government on its own initiative. However, when a censure motion is introduced, a prospective replacement candidate for Prime Minister must be nominated at the same time. If the censure motion carries, the replacement candidate is deemed to have the confidence of the Congress and automatically ascends as Prime Minister.

:Article 113

# The Congress of Deputies may require political responsibility from the Government by adopting a motion of censure (no confidence) by overall (absolute) majority of its Members.
# The motion of censure (no confidence) must be proposed by at least one tenth of the Members of Congress of Deputies and shall include a candidate for the office of the Presidency of the Government.
# The motion of censure (no confidence) may not be voted until five days after it has been submitted. During the first two days of this period, alternative motions may be submitted.
# If the motion of censure (no confidence) is not adopted by the Congress of Deputies, its signatories may not submit another during the same period of sessions.

:Article 114

# If the Congress of Deputies withholds its confidence from the Government, the latter shall submit its resignation to the King, whereafter the President of the Government shall be nominated in accordance with the provisions of Article 99.
# If the Congress of Deputies adopts a motion of censure (no confidence), the Government shall present its resignation to the King and the candidate included in it shall be understood to have the confidence of the Chamber for the purposes provided in section 99. The King shall appoint him President of the Government.

There have been five attempted constructive votes of no confidence. The first successful vote came on 1 June 2018, when Mariano Rajoy (People&#x27;s Party) was voted out in favour of Pedro Sánchez (Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party).

==Hungary==

Under the October 1989 democratic revision of the 1949 Constitution, the National Assembly of Hungary could not remove the Prime Minister of Hungary unless a prospective successor was nominated (and elected) at the same time:
:A motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister may be initiated by a written petition, which includes the nomination for a candidate for the office of Prime Minister, by no less than one-fifth of the Members of the National Assembly. A motion of no-confidence in the Prime Minister is considered a motion of no-confidence in the Government as well. Should, on the basis of this motion, the majority of the Members of the National Assembly withdraw their confidence, then the candidate nominated for Prime Minister in the motion shall be considered to have been elected.

===Use===
In March 2009 the prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány (Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP) announced he would hand over his position to a politician with a higher support of the parliament parties. The opposition Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) refused most candidates for the post proposed by the MSZP, but on 30 March 2009, Gordon Bajnai managed to get the backing of both parties. A constructive motion of no confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány took place on 14 April and Bajnai became Prime Minister.

===Fundamental Law of Hungary===
The new Constitution of Hungary, the Fundamental Law in force from 2012, has almost identical provisions that allow only constructive vote of no confidence by the absolute majority of the National Assembly of Hungary.

:Article 21

: (1) One-fifth of the Members of the National Assembly may, together with the designation of a candidate for the office of Prime Minister, submit a written motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister.

: (2) If the National Assembly supports the motion of no-confidence, it thereby expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister and simultaneously elects the person proposed for the office of Prime Minister in the motion of no-confidence. For such decision of the National Assembly, the votes of more than half of the Members of the National Assembly shall be required.

: (3) The Prime Minister may put forward a confidence vote. The National Assembly expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister if more than half of the Members of the National Assembly do not support the Prime Minister in the confidence vote proposed by the Prime Minister.

: (4) The Prime Minister may propose that the vote on a proposal submitted by the Government be simultaneously a confidence vote. The National Assembly expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister if it does not support the proposal submitted by the Government.

: (5) The National Assembly shall decide on the question of confidence after the third day, but no later than eight days following the submission of the motion of no-confidence or of the Prime Minister’s motion pursuant to Paragraphs (3) or (4).

==Lesotho==

Subsection (8) of section 87 of the Constitution of Lesotho stipulates that a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister of Lesotho is of no effect unless the National Assembly nominates one of its members to be appointed prime minister in place of the incumbent:

:A resolution of no confidence in the Government of Lesotho shall not be effective for the purposes of subsections (5)(a) and (7)(e) unless it proposes the name of a member of the National Assembly for the King to appoint in the place of the Prime Minister.

==Israel==

The constructive vote of no confidence has been in place since the direct election of the Prime Minister of Israel was abolished in 2001. By a vote of no confidence the Knesset (parliament) did not elect new prime minister but only proposed a &quot;formateur&quot;: a presumptive nominee charged with seeking to form a new government. The candidate proposed then might or might not secure a positive vote of confidence before becoming prime minister. The system, therefore, did not guarantee continuity in the same way as the constructive vote of no confidence was used in Germany and elsewhere. Amendment No. I of the Basic Law of Government 2001 removed the &quot;formateur&quot;, switching to a conventional constructive vote of no confidence. The Basic Law of Government 2001 provides in Section 28 (b):

:An expression of no confidence in the Government shall be done by means of a resolution of the Knesset, adopted by the majority of its Members to express confidence in another Government that announced basic guidelines of its policy, its make-up and the distribution of functions among Ministers, as stated in article 13 (d). The new Government shall be established once the Knesset has expressed confidence in it, and from that time the Ministers shall go into office.

==Poland==

The Constitution of Poland (1997) states that the &quot;Sejm&quot; (lower chamber of the National Assembly of Poland) may remove the Council of Ministers of Poland (cabinet) only by a resolution (adopted by absolute majority) which specifies the name of a replacement Prime Minister. If the motion carries, the person named in the motion is automatically deemed to have the confidence of the Sejm, and the President of Poland is required to appoint him as Prime Minister.

:Article 158

: The Sejm shall pass a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers by a majority of votes of the statutory number of Deputies, on a motion moved by at least 46 Deputies and that shall specify the name of a candidate for Prime Minister. If such a resolution has been passed by the Sejm, the President of the Republic shall accept the resignation of the Council of Ministers and appoint a new Prime Minister as chosen by the Sejm, and, on his application, the other members of the Council of Ministers and accept their oath of office.

: A motion to pass a resolution referred to in para. 1 above, may be put to a vote no sooner than 7 days after it has been submitted. A subsequent motion of a like kind may be submitted no sooner than after the end of 3 months from the day the previous motion was submitted.

==Albania==

The Constitution of Albania (1998 as amended in 2008 and 2012) stipulates also that only constructive vote of no confidence may be adopted by the absolute majority of the unicameral Assembly (parliament) deputies.

:Article 104 [Motion of confidence]

1. The Prime Minister has the right to submit to the Assembly a motion of confidence in the Council of Ministers. If the motion of confidence is voted by fewer than half of all the members of the Assembly, within 48 hours from the voting on the motion, the Prime Minister asks the President of the Republic to dissolve the Assembly.

2. The President dissolves the Assembly within 10 days from receipt of the request. A request for a motion of confidence may not be submitted during the period when a motion of no confidence according to article 105 is being examined.

3. The motion may not be voted on unless three days have passed from its submission.

:Article 105 [Motion of no confidence]

1. One fifth of the deputies have the right to submit for voting in the Assembly a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister in office, proposing a new Prime Minister.

2. The Assembly may vote a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister only by electing a new Prime Minister with the votes of more than half of all its members.

3. The President of the Republic decrees the discharge of the Prime Minister in office and the appointment of the elected Prime Minister no later than 10 days from the voting on the motion in the Assembly.

==Slovenia==

According to the Constitution of Slovenia (1991 as amended in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2013) the National Assembly (&quot;Državni zbor&quot;, lower chamber of the parliament) may pass a motion of no confidence in the Government only by electing a new prime minister.

:Article 116 [Vote of no confidence]

The National Assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the Government only by electing a new President of the Government on the proposal of at least ten deputies and by a majority vote of all deputies. The incumbent President of the Government is thereby dismissed, but together with his ministers he must continue to perform his regular duties until the swearing in of a new Government.

No less than forty-eight hours must elapse between the lodging of a proposal to elect a new President of the Government and the vote itself, unless the National Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds majority vote of all deputies, or if the country is at war or in a state of emergency.

Where the President of the Government has been elected on the basis of the fourth paragraph of Article 111, a vote of no confidence is expressed in him if on the proposal of at least ten deputies, the National Assembly elects a new President of the Government by a majority of votes cast.

:Article 117 [Vote of confidence]

The President of the Government may require a vote of confidence in the Government. If the Government does not receive the support of a majority vote of all deputies, within thirty days the National Assembly must elect a new President of the Government or in a new vote express its confidence in the incumbent President of the Government, or failing this, the President of the Republic dissolves the National Assembly and calls new elections. The President of the Government may tie the issue of confidence to the adoption of a law or to some other decision in the National Assembly. If such decision is not adopted, it is deemed that a vote of no confidence in the Government has been passed.

No less than forty-eight hours must elapse between the requirement of a vote of confidence and the vote itself.

==Belgium==

The Kingdom of Belgium adopted constructive vote of no confidence in the Constitution of Belgium (1994 coordinated text) article considering the dissolution of parliament.

:Article 46 [Reasons for Dissolution]

(1) The King has only the right to dissolve the Chamber of Representatives if the latter, with the absolute majority of its members:

1) either rejects a motion of confidence in the federal Government and does not propose to the King, within three days from the day of the rejection of the motion, the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister;

2) or adopts a motion of disapproval (no confidence) with regard to the federal Government and does not simultaneously propose to the King the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister.

(2) The motions of confidence and disapproval can only be voted on after a delay of forty-eight hours after the introduction of the motion.

(3) Moreover, the King may, in the event of the resignation of the federal Government, dissolve the Chamber of Representatives after having received its agreement expressed by the absolute majority of its members.

(4) The dissolution of the Chamber of Representatives entails the dissolution of the Senate.

(5) The act of dissolution involves the convoking of the electorate within forty days and of the Chambers within two months.

==Westminster systems==
In partisan Westminster systems, a constructive vote of no confidence is normally not required. A prime minister faced with a vote of no confidence must either resign immediately or request a dissolution of parliament and fresh elections. This system is normally stable because strong political parties in the Westminster system ensure a very small number of viable candidates to replace a prime minister, and also ensures frequent and stable majority government.

However, this was not always the case historically, especially in Westminster systems without clearly defined political parties. In such circumstances, it was often the case that the sitting prime minister would be unpopular with parliamentarians but also might not have a viable successor who could have a better command of the parliament. In such cases, it was informally expected that parliament refrain from a vote of no confidence unless there was a reasonably obvious successor, in which case the prime minister would usually be expected to resign without recourse to fresh elections.

On the other hand, if a prime minister in a nonpartisan Westminster system sustained a vote of no confidence in spite of the lack of an obviously viable successor then depending on the circumstances he might have up to two alternatives to resignation: call fresh elections or attempt to continue governing in spite of the non-confidence vote.

<text>The Whanganui campaign was a brief round of hostilities in the North Island of New Zealand as indigenous Māori fought British settlers and military forces in 1847. The campaign, which included a siege of the fledgling Whanganui settlement (then named &quot;Petre&quot;), was among the earliest of the 19th century New Zealand Wars that were fought over issues of land and sovereignty.

==Background==
The settlement of Petre, preferably known as &quot;Wanganui&quot; by its settlers, was established by the New Zealand Company in 1840. William Wakefield stated that he had purchased the land for the settlement from the local Māori in November 1839, which some Māori disputed. By 1845, the settlement had grown to about 200 people and about 60 houses. The surrounding area was inhabited by about 4000 Māori, with whom the settlers traded for food. There was nevertheless friction over the occupation of the land, which some Māori chiefs denied having sold, with New Zealand Company surveyors reporting obstruction and harassment.

In March 1846, hostilities broke out in the nearby Hutt Valley over similar issues of disputed land occupation. One of the most prominent fighters in Hutt Valley was Te Mamaku, a principal chief of the Ngāti-Hāua-te-Rangi tribe of the Upper Whanganui. The settlers in Whanganui became worried that the conflict would expand to encompass their region, so requested military protection.

A force made up of the 58th Regiment (5–6 officers, 4 sergeants and 160 men), Royal Artillery (4 men with 2 12-pounder guns on garrison carriages), Royal Engineers (1 officer with tools for 200 men), Commissariat (1 officer with salt provisions for two months and £500), and Medical (1 officer)—landed from HMS &quot;Calliope&quot; at Wanganui in December 1846 to construct the garrison&#x27;s stockade. Lieutenant Thomas Bernard Collinson, Royal Engineers, noted:
Dec. 13. We landed in boats at the mouth of the Wanganui River: all the rivers on that coast of Cook&#x27;s Straits have bar harbours; and had to make 4 miles up to the village. This was rather an exciting march, as we had no idea what sort of reception we should meet; and might have to fight our way. Happily the prestige of the &quot;Hoia&quot; (i.e. Soldiers) was still considerable, and we entered the little settlement in peaceful triumph; to the great joy of the few white settlers.
There, Collinson and Captain Joseph Henry Laye, 58th Regiment, selected the hill pā of Pukenamu at the town&#x27;s northern end for the Rutland Stockade, and commenced its construction. Another 100 soldiers from the Grenadier Company of the 65th Regiment arrived in May 1847. The York Stockade was built on high ground to the south. The establishment of the garrison led Te Mamaku to anticipate further government intervention. He vowed to fight the soldiers but not the settlers.

==Attack and siege==
Hapurona Nga Rangi, a minor chief of Putiki, was employed by Midshipman Crozier of the gunboat, to build a house for him in the Rutland stockade. Whilst Nga Rangi collected his wages on 16 April 1847, he suffered a severe gunshot wound to the head from the discharge of Crozier&#x27;s pistol. The ball passed through his right cheekbone and lodged somewhere in his skull. The shot was claimed to have been accidental and Crozier was restrained whilst the incident was investigated. Nga Rangi was placed under the care of Dr Thomas Moore Philson of the 58th Regiment, and when sufficiently recovered from his wound, confirmed that the shot had been accidental.

A small party of Māori nevertheless decided to exact &quot;utu&quot; (revenge, or recompense) for the blood-letting. They attacked John Alexander Gilfillan and family at home on 18 April with tomahawks, killing his wife and three of their children, severely wounding Gilfillan and his second daughter, and leaving two infant babies untouched. Five of the six killers were captured by lower Whanganui Māori and handed over to the British; four were court-martialled in Whanganui and hanged at Rutland Stockade. The execution inflamed the situation, prompting a much larger revenge attack.

Between 500 and 600 heavily armed Māori formed a &quot;taua&quot; (war party) that travelled down the Whanganui River in war canoes in early May, plundering and burning settlers&#x27; houses and killing cattle. The warriors killed and mutilated a soldier from the 58th Regiment who ventured out of the town. The town&#x27;s residents began sleeping in a small group of fortified houses, abandoning their homes each night.

On 19 May, Te Mamaku&#x27;s warriors made their first attack on the town, approaching from the west and north, effectively besieging the settlement. More homes were ransacked. The British gunboat fired from the river, mortally wounding Maketu, a chief. Rockets were fired at besiegers from two armed boats on 24 May when Governor George Grey arrived. The governor was accompanied by Tāmati Wāka Nene, future Māori king Te Wherowhero and several other northern chiefs in a bid to defuse the situation.

In June reconnaissance missions were mounted up the valley of the Whanganui River from the garrison—which now contained 500 to 600 soldiers—resulting in some minor skirmishes. By mid-winter Māori leaders, recognising they had reached a stalemate and conscious that their potato-planting season was approaching, decided to launch a full attack on the town to draw troops from their forts.

On 19 July, some 400 Māori fighters approached the town from the low hills inland, occupying a ridge at St John&#x27;s Wood where they dug trenches and rifle-pits, then breastworks. About 400 imperial soldiers commanded by William Anson McCleverty became involved in a series of skirmishes along a narrow pathway through swampy ground. After being bombarded with artillery fire, Māori forces charged on the troops, who responded with a bayonet charge, halting the Māori advance. Māori withdrew to the trenches and breastworks, maintaining fire on the British troops until nightfall. Three British soldiers died and one was wounded in the clash; three Māori were killed and about 12 wounded in the so-called Battle of St John&#x27;s Wood.

On 23 July, Te Mamaku&#x27;s forces, at least 600 men, returned to their entrenchments on the hill at St John&#x27;s Wood and planted a red ensign. McCleverty readied his forces to defend the town and move out to engage. The guns opened fire on a few Māori appearing on the low hills, who then retired. The chief of Putiki, granted permission to talk with the opponents, ventured out with the interpreter, Mr Duncan, and spoke with Te Oro, Te Mamaku&#x27;s brother. He informed them that the Māori would not attack the British positions because of the danger of British artillery fire, and as the soldiers would not attack the Māori entrenchments either, Māori forces would retire the next day. Te Oro said that the Māori were determined not to have peace, but the British commander anticipated that this disengagement would end the war for the winter. Te Mamaku&#x27;s forces departed the next day; they split into two groups and some fighting between these groups was reported.

Soon after, Wanganui settlers ventured out of town again, returned to their farms, settled matters of cattle losses with their besiegers and re-established trade with them, such that peace was generally established about two months later. In February 1848, with Hōri Kīngi Te Ānaua as interpreter, Grey and Te Mamaku negotiated a peace settlement to the underlying long-unsettled land question. On that matter Collinson observed in 1855: 

&quot;Thus ended the last serious disturbance that has occurred in New Zealand up to the present date; and as the peace was confirmed and strengthened in 1848, by the payment of the £1,000 for the land, and the complete concession by the whole of the natives concerned of the block claimed by the New Zealand Company; it may be considered that the peace and prosperity of this populous and troublesome district is as permanently established as that of any settlement in the Colony.&quot;
Twelve years of economic cooperation and development followed, with the gradual alienation of yet more Māori land which led to more conflict.

<text>Kraut is a German word recorded in English from 1918 onwards as an ethnic slur for a German, particularly a German soldier during World War I and World War II. Its earlier meaning in English was as a synonym for sauerkraut, a traditional Central and Eastern European food.

== Etymological foundations ==
In German, the term means &quot;herb&quot;, or designates the leaves and stem of a plant as opposed to the root. The term is more often used in compound nouns for herbs, and also for cabbage and cabbage products:

* &quot;Weißkraut&quot; = white cabbage (also called &quot;Weißkohl&quot;)
* &quot;Blaukraut&quot; or &quot;Rotkraut&quot; = red cabbage (also called &quot;Rotkohl&quot;)
* &quot;Sauerkraut&quot; = fermented white cabbage or &#x27;sour cabbage&#x27;
* &quot;Unkraut&quot; = weed
* &quot;Bohnenkraut&quot; = savory
* &quot;Rübenkraut&quot; = thick sugar beet syrup

The plural &quot;Kräuter&quot; is commonly used (herbs, weeds) when talking about spices, but is often replaced by &quot;Gewürz&quot; which can refer to any spice.

== Slang ==
It was recorded as a colloquial term for Germans by the mid-19th century. During World War I, &quot;Kraut&quot; came to be used in English as an ethnic slur for a German. However, during World War I, it was mainly used by British Soldiers; during World War II, it became used mainly by American soldiers and less so by British soldiers, who preferred the terms &quot;Jerry&quot; or &quot;Fritz&quot;.

== Demonym ==
The Bauer Krauts were an atom-level hockey team based in Kitchener, Ontario (known as &quot;Berlin, Ontario&quot; prior to the outbreak of World War I); they were active in the 20th century.

== Music ==
Krautrock is a popular term for a form of German experimental rock of the late 1960s and 1970s. Krautrock was typified by acts such as Amon Düül II, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Tangerine Dream, Faust, Can and David Bowie on his &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; albums &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Lodger&quot;, as well as many others.

Kraut was the name of a New York punk rock band in the 1980s. Their song &quot;All Twisted&quot; was the first independent video to air on MTV.

&quot;Magic Kraut&quot; is the name of a song in the album &quot;Fresh&quot; by Teddybears.

Industrial rock band KMFDM’s song “Kraut” appears on the b-side of their “Juke Joint Jezebel” single, and on their &quot;Extra, Vol. 3&quot; compilation.

&quot;Krauts with Attitude&quot; is the title of the record released in Germany in 1991; it is credited for playing a prominent role in establishing the German hip hop scene.

The Swedish indie rock band Peter Bjorn and John composed the track titled &quot;School of Kraut&quot;.

<text>is a Buddhist temple in the city of Uji in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, built in the late Heian period. It is jointly a temple of the Jōdo-shū (Pure Land) and Tendai-shū (Heavenly Level) sects.

== History ==
This temple was originally built in 998 in the Heian period as a rural villa of high-ranking courtier , Minister of the Left. After he died, one of the most powerful members of the Fujiwara clan, Fujiwara no Michinaga, purchased the property from the courtier&#x27;s widow. The villa was made into a Buddhist temple by his son Fujiwara no Yorimichi in 1052. Being one of the World Heritage sites of Japan, the Byodoin Temple buildings and Buddha statues have a long history of about 1000 years.
In East Asian Buddhism, there is the Three Ages of Buddhism, which are three divisions of time following Buddha&#x27;s passing. The Mappo, which is also translated as the Age of Dharma Decline, is the degenerate Third Age of Buddhism, also known as the Latter Day of the Law. It was widely believed that the year 1052 marked the first year of the beginning of the end-of-the-world. This theory captured the heart of many aristocrats and monks, which as a result, people became more devout in Buddhism and believed in the ideology of Buddhist Pure Land. In the following year, Amida-do Hall (Phoenix Hall) was completed in whose interior sits the 2.4 meters tall Amida Buddha statue created by Jōchō, who is claimed to have been the best Buddhist sculptor in the Heian Period.

Masashige Kusunoki, a samurai warrior who was fighting against the army of the Ashikaga Clan, set a fire around Byodoin Temple in 1336, which resulted in many of the temple buildings were burnt down with only a few surviving.

The Byodoin Temple gradually expanded into a massive Temple complex during the Kamakura Period, where Jodo-in Temple was opened due to the renovation of Byodoin Temple in 1496; Rakan-do Hall was established in 1640; Saisho-in Temple was established in 1654.

A full-scale renovation of the Amida-do Hall (Phoenix Hall) was undertaken in 1670, during which the front doors were replaced. Two sub-temples, Jodo-in Temple belonging to the Jodo Sect and Saisho-in Temple belonging to the Tendai Sect, began to cooperate and made a great effort to maintain the operation of Byodoin Temple. In 1698, Uji was devastated by a large fire and Byodoin Temple was badly damaged. The walls and doors of Phoenix Hall were ruined after this incident. However, as a result of the deterioration of the temple, people&#x27;s will for Phoenix Hall&#x27;s preservation and renovation became enthusiastic.

During the Meiji Period (1868–1912) and Showa Period (1926–1989), large scale renovation of the Phoenix hall was undertaken. The Phoenix Hall and Amida Buddha statue were designated as National Treasures in 1951, which Phoenix Hall was also selected for the design as the obverse of the 10 yen coin. Then, the Temple Bell, the praying Bodhisattva on Clouds, the Canopy, the paintings on the door and walls of Cho-do Hall of Phoenix Hall were designated as National Treasures.

The Byodoin Temple was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage as one of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto in 1994. Large scale renovation on the garden, the canopy of Amida Buddha statue and the overall outlook of the Phoenix Hall continues in the Heisei Period (1989–2019) until today.

The most famous building in the temple is the or the Amida Hall, constructed in 1053. It is the only remaining original building, surrounded by a scenic pond; additional buildings making up the compound were burnt down during a civil war in 1336.

== Complex ==
=== Phoenix Hall ===

The main building in Byōdō-in, the Phoenix Hall consists of a central hall, flanked by twin wing corridors on both sides of the central hall, and a tail corridor. The central hall houses an image of Amida Buddha. The roof of the hall displays statues of the Chinese phoenix, called &quot;hōō&quot; in Japanese. The architecture was influenced by the Chinese style (popular in the capital). The building is regarded as almost the sole remaining example from the Fujiwara Regent Period, which is also considered as one of the most important cultural assets of Japan.

The Phoenix Hall, completed in 1053, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Though its official name is Amida-dō, it began to be called Hōō-dō, or Phoenix Hall, in the beginning of the Edo period. This name is considered to derive both from the building&#x27;s likeness to a chinese phoenix with outstretched wings and a tail, and the pair of phoenixes adorning the roof.

Inside the Phoenix Hall, a single image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture is made of Japanese cypress and is covered with gold leaf. It was executed by Jōchō, who established a new canon of proportions and a new technique, &quot;yosegi&quot;, in which multiple pieces of wood are carved out like shells and joined from the inside. The statue measures about three meters high from its face to its knees. Sitting in a meditation position with his back slightly hunched, his body is relaxed without any tension. His hand gesture is called &#x27;Inso&#x27;, which both hands are placed on the lap, palms facing upward, thumbs and forefingers form a circle. This gesture is a variation of the Dhyana Mudra (Meditation Mudra), which suggests concentration of the Good Law. The Urna, which is the white dot on his forehead between the eyes, is the Third Eye of the Amida Buddha, a symbol of awakening and the ability to see the suffering of all creatures. The serene smile of the statue represents the nobility of the Buddha after attaining Enlightenment. With a harmonious and gentle facial expression, he is looking slightly downward, which shows the state of meditation, as well as the feeling of merciful grace towards the audience. His hair is short and curled, along with Ushnisha, which is the pointed topknot located on the center of the head.

Applied to the walls of the hall are small relief carvings of celestials, the host believed to have accompanied Amida when he descended from the Western Paradise to gather the souls of believers at the moment of death and transport them in lotus blossoms to Paradise. &quot;Raigō&quot; paintings on the wooden doors of the Phoenix Hall, depicting the Descent of the Amida Buddha, are an early example of Yamato-e, Japanese-style painting, and contain representations of the scenery around Kyoto.

There is a &quot;Jōdo-shiki&quot; garden with a pond in front of the building, which in 1997 was dredged as part of an archeological dig. As the temple faces the East, it suggests that the audience need to cross the Aji-ike pond in front of the Phoenix Hall, in order to reach Buddhist Pure Land. The gardens are a nationally designated Historic Site and Place of Scenic Beauty.

=== Kannon-do Hall ===

The Kannon-do Hall is an Important Cultural Property, established on the former site of the main hall around 1230, during the Early Kamakura Period. The hall structure is simple, which follows the classical design from the Tenpyo period (710-794), having two different form bent to support the roof. It is currently under renovation and not open to the public.

Japan commemorates the building&#x27;s longevity and cultural significance by displaying its image on the 10 yen coin, and the 10,000 yen note features the phoenix image. In December 1994, UNESCO listed the building as a World Heritage Site as part of the &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto&quot;. The Phoenix Hall, the great statue of Amida inside it, and several other items at Byōdō-in are national treasures.
A half-size replica of the temple was completed on June 7, 1968 in the Valley of the Temples (O&#x27;ahu, Hawaii).
The Japanese post has issued three definitive postage stamps showing the phoenix hall, each prepaying the then postal rate for a surface mail foreign letter: 1950, 24 yen 1957 and 30 yen 1959. Stamps were produced by the costly engraving method, showing the appreciation of the hall.

=== Yorin-an Shoin Residence ===

It is a residence as well as one of the sub-temples in the precinct. Built in the early Edo Period (around 17th century), the roof is thatched with Japanese cypress bark, which the materials used for construction were believed came from remains of the Momoyama Castle. The interior wall paintings were the works produced by artists who belonged to the studio run by Sansetsu Kano, while the garden is said to have been designed by Sansai Hosokawa.

=== Hoshokan Museum ===

As the former temple museum which opened in 1965 had become outdated, an innovative third-generation museum was opened on March 1, 2001, which is named the Hoshokan Museum. This museum achieved a significantly improved storage and display environment for national treasures from the Byodoin Temple, including the Temple Bell, 26 statues of the Praying Bodhisattva on Clouds and a pair of Phoenix from the rooftop of Phoenix Hall. It is the first comprehensive museum run by a religious organisation. The majority of the museum buildings are hidden underground, so that the exterior outlook of museum&#x27;s blends with Phoenix Hall and other building complexes within the temple. Due to its design, the interior of the museum receives sufficient natural sunlight, as well as artificial lighting to keep the exhibition halls bright and comfortable for audience&#x27;s experience.

Entry to the complex grounds costs 700 yen for adults, and includes access to the gardens and the museum. An entry pass to the Phoenix Hall, which was newly restored in March 2014, costs an additional 300 yen and can be purchased near the gate. The tour is conducted in Japanese, however English paper guide book is provided.

=== Byodoin Tea Salon Toka ===

<doc id="217946" wikidata="Q3621156" url="?curid=217946" title="Lemon battery">
<text>A lemon battery is a simple battery often made for the purpose of education. Typically, a piece of zinc metal (such as a galvanized nail) and a piece of copper (such as a penny) are inserted into a lemon and connected by wires. Power generated by reaction of the metals is used to power a small device such as a light-emitting diode (LED).

The lemon battery is similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice. The lemon battery illustrates the type of chemical reaction (oxidation-reduction) that occurs in batteries. The zinc and copper are called the electrodes, and the juice inside the lemon is called the electrolyte. There are many variations of the lemon cell that use different fruits (or liquids) as electrolytes and metals other than zinc and copper as electrodes.

==Use in school projects==
There are numerous sets of instructions for making lemon batteries and for obtaining components such as light-emitting diodes, (LEDs), electrical meters (multimeters), and zinc-coated (galvanized) nails and screws. Commercial &quot;potato clock&quot; science kits include electrodes and a low-voltage digital clock. After one cell is assembled, a multimeter can be used to measure the voltage or the electric current from the voltaic cell; a typical voltage is 0.9 V with lemons. Currents are more variable, but range up to about 1 mA (the larger the electrode surfaces, the bigger the current). For a more visible effect, lemon cells can be connected in series to power an LED (see illustration) or other devices. The series connection increases the voltage available to devices. Swartling and Morgan have published a list of low-voltage devices along with the corresponding number of lemon cells that were needed to power them; they included LEDs, piezoelectric buzzers, and small digital clocks. With the zinc/copper electrodes, at least two lemon cells were needed for any of these devices. Substituting a magnesium electrode for the zinc electrode makes a cell with a larger voltage (1.5−1.6 V), and a single magnesium/copper cell will power some devices. Note that incandescent light bulbs from flashlights are not used because the lemon battery is not designed to produce enough electric current to light them. Such a battery typically produces 0.001 A (1 mA) of current at a potential difference of 0.7 V; these values are multiplied together to determine the overall power of 0.0007 W (0.7 mW). 

===Variations===

Many fruits and liquids can be used for the acidic electrolyte. Fruit is convenient, because it provides both the electrolyte and a simple way to support the electrodes. The acid involved in citrus fruits (lemons, oranges, grapefruits, etc.) is citric acid. The acidity, which is indicated by the measured pH, varies substantially.

Potatoes have phosphoric acid and work well; they are the basis for commercial &quot;potato clock&quot; kits. Potato batteries with LED lighting have been proposed for use in poor countries or by off-grid populations. International research begun in 2010 showed that boiling potatoes for eight minutes improves their electrical output, as does placing slices of potatoes between multiple copper and zinc plates. Boiled and chopped plantain pith (stem) is also suitable, according to Sri Lankan researchers.

Instead of fruit, liquids in various containers can be used. Household vinegar (acetic acid) works well. Sauerkraut (lactic acid) was featured in one episode of the US television program &quot;Head Rush&quot; (an offshoot of the &quot;MythBusters&quot; program). The sauerkraut had been canned, and became the electrolyte while the can itself was one of the electrodes.

Zinc and copper electrodes are reasonably safe and easy to obtain. Other metals such as lead, iron, magnesium, etc., can be studied as well; they yield different voltages than the zinc/copper pair. In particular, magnesium/copper electrodes can generate voltages as large as 1.6 V in lemon cells. This voltage is larger than obtainable using zinc/copper cells. It is comparable to that of standard household batteries (1.5 V), which is useful in powering devices with a single cell instead of using cells in series.

===Learning outcomes===
For the youngest pupils, about ages 5–9, the educational goal is utilitarian: batteries are devices that can power other devices, as long as they are connected by a conductive material. Batteries are components in electrical circuits; hooking a single wire between a battery and a light bulb will not power the bulb.

For children in the age range 10−13, batteries are used to illustrate the connection between chemistry and electricity as well as to deepen the circuit concept for electricity. The fact that different chemical elements such as copper and zinc are used can be placed in the larger context that the elements do not disappear or break down when they undergo chemical reactions.

For older pupils and for college students, batteries serve to illustrate the principles of oxidation-reduction reactions. Students can discover that two identical electrodes yield no voltage and that different pairs of metals (beyond copper and zinc) yield different voltages. The voltages and currents from series and parallel combinations of the batteries can be examined.

The current that is output by the battery through a meter will depend on the size of the electrodes, how far the electrodes are inserted into the fruit, and how close to each other the electrodes are placed; the voltage is fairly independent of these details of the electrodes.

==Chemistry==

Most textbooks present the following model for the chemical reactions of a lemon battery. When the cell is providing an electric current through an external circuit, the metallic zinc at the surface of the zinc electrode is dissolving into the solution. Zinc atoms dissolve into the liquid electrolyte as electrically charged ions (Zn2+), leaving 2 negatively charged electrons (e−) behind in the metal:

This reaction is called oxidation. While zinc is entering the electrolyte, two positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) from the electrolyte combine with two electrons at the copper electrode&#x27;s surface and form an uncharged hydrogen molecule (H2):
This reaction is called reduction. The electrons used in the copper to form the molecules of hydrogen are transferred from the zinc through an external wire connecting between the copper and the zinc. The hydrogen molecules formed on the surface of the copper by the reduction reaction ultimately bubble away as hydrogen gas.

==Experiment results==
This model of the chemical reactions makes several predictions that were examined in experiments published by Jerry Goodisman in 2001. Goodisman notes that numerous recent authors propose chemical reactions for the lemon battery that involve dissolution of the copper electrode into the electrolyte. Goodisman excludes this reaction as being inconsistent with the experiments, and notes that the correct chemistry, which involves the evolution of hydrogen at the copper electrode but also can use silver instead of copper, has been known for many years. Most of the detailed predictions of the model apply to the battery&#x27;s voltage that is measured directly by a meter at open circuit (nothing else is connected to the battery). When the electrolyte was modified by adding zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), the voltage from the cell was reduced as predicted using the Nernst equation for the model. The Nernst equation essentially says how much the voltage drops as more zinc sulfate is added. The addition of copper sulfate (CuSO4) did not affect the voltage. This result is consistent with the fact that copper atoms from the electrode are not involved in the chemical reaction model for the cell.

When the battery is hooked up to an external circuit and a significant electric current is flowing, the zinc electrode loses mass, as predicted by the zinc oxidation reaction above. Similarly, hydrogen gas evolves as bubbles from the copper electrode. Finally, the voltage from the cell depended upon the acidity of the electrolyte, as measured by its pH; decreasing acidity (and increasing pH) causes the voltage to fall. This effect is also predicted by the Nernst equation; the particular acid that was used (citric, hydrochloric, sulfuric, etc.) does not affect the voltage except through the pH value.

The Nernst equation prediction failed for strongly acid electrolytes (pH &lt; 3.4), when the zinc electrode dissolves into the electrolyte even when the battery is not providing any current to a circuit. The two oxidation-reduction reactions listed above only occur when electrical charge can be transported through the external circuit. The additional, open-circuit reaction can be observed by the formation of bubbles at the zinc electrode under open-circuit. This effect ultimately limited the voltage of the cells to 1.0 V near room temperature at the highest levels of acidity.

===Energy source===

The energy comes from the chemical change in the zinc when it dissolves into the acid. The energy does not come from the lemon or potato. The zinc is oxidized inside the lemon, exchanging some of its electrons with the acid in order to reach a lower energy state, and the energy released provides the power.

In current practice, zinc is produced by electrowinning of zinc sulfate or pyrometallurgical reduction of zinc with carbon, which requires an energy input. The energy produced in the lemon battery comes from reversing this reaction, recovering some of the energy input during the zinc production.

===Smee cell===
From 1840 to the late 19th century, large, voltaic cells using a zinc electrode and a sulfuric acid electrolyte were widely used in the printing industry. While copper electrodes like those in lemon batteries were sometimes used, in 1840 Alfred Smee invented a refined version of this cell that used silver with a rough platinum coating instead of a copper electrode. Hydrogen gas clinging to the surface of a silver or copper electrode reduces the electric current that can be drawn from a cell; the phenomenon is called &quot;polarization&quot;. The roughened, &quot;platinized&quot; surface speeds up the bubbling of the hydrogen gas, and increases the current from the cell. Unlike the zinc electrode, the copper or platinized silver electrodes are not consumed by using the battery, and the details of this electrode do not affect the cell&#x27;s voltage. The Smee cell was convenient for electrotyping, which produced copper plates for letterpress printing of newspapers and books, and also statues and other metallic objects.

The Smee cell used amalgamated zinc instead of pure zinc; the surface of amalgamated zinc has been treated with mercury. Apparently amalgamated zinc was less prone to degradation by an acidic solution than is pure zinc. Amalgamated zinc and plain zinc electrodes give essentially the same voltage when the zinc is pure. With the imperfectly refined zinc in 19th century laboratories they typically gave different voltages.

<doc id="217947" wikidata="Q220193" url="?curid=217947" title="Premenstrual syndrome">
<text>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a disruptive set of emotional and physical symptoms that regularly occur in the one to two weeks before the start of each menstrual period. Symptoms resolve around the time menstrual bleeding begins. Symptoms vary, though commonly include one or more physical, emotional, or behavioral symptoms, that resolve with menses. The range of symptoms is wide, and most commonly are breast tenderness, bloating, headache, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger, and irritability. To be diagnosed as PMS, rather than a normal discomfort of the menstrual cycle, these symptoms must interfere with daily living, during two menstrual cycles of prospective recording. PMS-related symptoms are often present for about six days. An individual&#x27;s pattern of symptoms may change over time. PMS does not produce symptoms during pregnancy or following menopause.
Diagnosis requires a consistent pattern of emotional and physical symptoms occurring after ovulation and before menstruation to a degree that interferes with normal life. Emotional symptoms must not be present during the initial part of the menstrual cycle. A daily list of symptoms over a few months may help in diagnosis. Other disorders that cause similar symptoms need to be excluded before a diagnosis is made.
The cause of PMS is unknown, but the underlying mechanism is believed to involve changes in hormone levels during the course of the whole menstrual cycle. Reducing salt, alcohol, caffeine, and stress, along with increasing exercise is typically all that is recommended for the management of mild symptoms. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be useful in some. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen may help with physical symptoms. In those with more significant symptoms, birth control pills or the diuretic spironolactone may be useful.
Over 90% of women report having some premenstrual symptoms, such as bloating, headaches, and moodiness. Premenstrual symptoms generally do not cause substantial disruption, and qualify as PMS in approximately 20% of pre-menopausal women. Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) class may be used to treat the emotional symptoms of PMS.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe condition that has greater psychological symptoms. PMDD affects about 3% of women of child-bearing age.

==Signs and symptoms==
Any disruptive, cyclical symptom could be a symptom of PMS, and some sources have suggested that the number of claimed symptoms could exceed even 200. However, some symptoms are relatively common in PMS. Common emotional and non-specific symptoms include stress, anxiety, difficulty with sleep, headache, feeling tired, mood swings, increased emotional sensitivity, and changes in interest in sex. Problems with concentration and memory may occur. There may also be depression or anxiety.

Common physical symptoms include bloating, bilateral breast tenderness, and headache.

The exact symptoms and their intensity vary significantly from person to person, and even somewhat from cycle to cycle and over time. Most people with premenstrual syndrome experience only a few of the possible symptoms, in a relatively predictable pattern. Additionally, which symptoms are accepted as evidence of PMS varies by culture. For example, women in China report feeling cold but do not report negative affect as part of PMS, while women in the US report negative affect but not feeling cold as part of PMS.

The exclusion of certain symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle can pose a challenge for researchers. For example, period pain, which is common, is excluded, as it does not usually appear until menstruation, but some experience period pain prior. However, any kind of pain can contribute to stress, difficulty with sleep, fatigue, irritability, and other symptoms that do count towards a PMS diagnosis.

==Causes==
While PMS is linked to the luteal phase, the causes of PMS are not clear, but several factors may be involved. Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle seem to be an important factor, with changing hormone levels affecting some more than others. PMS occurs more often in those who are in their late 20s and early 40s, have at least one child, have a family history of depression, and have a past medical history of either postpartum depression or a mood disorder.

==Diagnosis==
No laboratory tests or unique physical findings exist to verify a PMS diagnosis. However, the three key features are noted:

* The chief complaint is one or more of the emotional symptoms associated with PMS. Irritability, tension, or unhappiness are typical emotional symptoms.
* Symptoms appear predictably during the luteal (premenstrual) phase, reduce or disappear predictably shortly before or during menstruation, and remain absent during the follicular (pre-ovulatory) phase.
* The symptoms must be severe enough to cause distress or interfere with everyday life. Mild or occasional symptoms, which are extremely common, do not necessarily qualify as PMS.

The National Institute of Mental Health research definition compares the intensity of symptoms from cycle days 5 to 10 to the six-day interval before the onset of the menstrual period. To qualify as PMS, symptom intensity must increase at least 30% in the six days before menstruation. Additionally, this pattern must be documented for at least two consecutive cycles. In 2016, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists argued that the definition of PMS should be changed to no longer require the presence of a psychological symptom. 

To document a pattern, potentially affected individuals may keep a prospective record of their symptoms on a calendar for at least two menstrual cycles. This will help to establish if the symptoms are limited to the premenstrual time, predictably recurring, and disruptive to normal functioning. A number of standardized instruments have been developed to describe PMS, including the Calendar of Premenstrual syndrome Experiences (COPE), the Prospective Record of the Impact and Severity of Menstruation (PRISM), and the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). 

Additionally, other conditions that may better explain symptoms must be excluded, as a number of pre-existing medical conditions may be made worse at menstruation. This is known as menstrual exacerbation or premenstrual magnification. These conditions may lead individuals who do not have PMS to incorrectly believe they have PMS when they have another underlying disorder, such as anemia, hypothyroidism, eating disorders and substance abuse. A key feature is that these conditions may also be present outside of the luteal phase. Conditions that can be magnified perimenstrually include depression or other affective disorders, migraine, seizure disorders, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and allergies. 

Further, problems with other aspects of the female reproductive system must be excluded, including dysmenorrhea (period pain during menstruation, rather than before it), endometriosis, perimenopause, and adverse effects produced by oral contraceptive pills.

Severe symptoms may qualify as PMDD.
==Management==
Many treatments have been tried in PMS. Typical recommendations for those with mild symptoms include:

* reducing salt and caffeine intake,
* not drinking alcohol,
* reducing stress, e.g., by scheduling fewer activities during the week before menstruation,
* learning what to expect with PMS,
* increasing exercise, and 
* improving sleep. 

When self-care is not adequate, then medical management may be appropriate.

=== Management of physical symptoms ===
Anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen may help with some physical symptoms, such as pain.

Spironolactone is effective as a diuretic when water retention cannot be addressed through self-care alone; however, thiazide diuretics are ineffective.

==== Hormonal medications ====
In those with more significant symptoms birth control pills may be useful. Hormonal contraception is commonly used; common forms include the combined oral contraceptive pill and the contraceptive patch. This class of medication may cause PMS-related symptoms in some and may reduce physical symptoms in others. They do not relieve emotional symptoms.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists can be useful in severe forms of PMS but have their own set of significant potential side effects, such as bone loss.

Progesterone support was used for many years – in the 1950s, a deficiency of progesterone was believed to be the cause of PMS – but it does not provide any benefit.

===Management of emotional symptoms===

==== Antidepressants ====
Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs and venlafaxine, are used as the first-line treatment of severe emotional symptoms of PMS, and also in treating PMDD. Those with PMS may be able to take medication only on the days when symptoms are expected to occur, because relief often appears within a few days, rather than the longer timespan expected for depression or other common psychiatric conditions. Additionally, the minimum dose is often lower than for treatment of depression. Although intermittent therapy might be effective and acceptable to some, it might be less effective than continuous regimens for others, especially if they are also experiencing symptoms unrelated to the menstrual cycle. Side effects such as nausea and weakness are however relatively common.

===Vitamins, minerals, and alternative medicine===
Calcium, magnesium, vitamin E, vitamin B6, chasteberry, and black cohosh may help some. St. John&#x27;s wort is discouraged because it causes many drug–drug interactions. Although St John&#x27;s wort may help some with PMS, it is ineffective for PMDD. Evening primrose oil does not help.

==Prognosis==
PMS is generally a stable diagnosis, with susceptible individuals experiencing the same symptoms at the same intensity near the end of each cycle for years. Treatment for specific symptoms is usually effective. Unsuccessful medical management of severe symptoms frequently indicates misdiagnosis.

Perimenstrual breast pain is associated with fibrocystic breast changes.

Even without treatment, symptoms tend to decrease in perimenopausal women, and induction of menopause through surgical removal of the ovaries is a treatment of last resort. However, those who experience PMS or PMDD are more likely to have significant symptoms associated with menopause, such as hot flashes.

==Epidemiology==
Over 90% of women report having some premenstrual symptoms, such as bloating, headaches, and moodiness. Mostly the symptoms are mild.

Globally, about 20% of women of reproductive age have PMS that disrupts their everyday lives. Additionally, about 30% of women have mild or moderate symptoms related to their menstrual cycles that do not disrupt their everyday lives.

==History==
PMS was originally seen as an imagined disease. Women who reported its symptoms were often told it was &quot;all in their head&quot;. Woman&#x27;s reproductive organs were thought to control them. Women were warned not to divert needed energy away from the uterus and ovaries. This view of limited energy very quickly ran up against a reality in 19th-century America that young girls worked extremely long and hard hours in factories; newspapers in the 19th century were peppered with remedies to help in the &quot;tyrannous processes&quot; of the menstrual cycle. In 1873 Edward Clarke published an influential book titled &quot;Sex in Education&quot;. Clarke came to the conclusion that female operatives suffer less than schoolgirls because they &quot;work their brain less&quot;. This suggested that they have stronger bodies and a reproductive &quot;apparatus more normally constructed&quot;. Feminists later took opposition to Clarke&#x27;s argument that women should not leave the private sphere by showing that women could function in the world outside the home in spite of natural body functions.

The first formal description of what is now called PMS as a medical problem, rather than a normal and natural variation, goes back to 1931, in a paper presented at the New York Academy of Medicine by Robert T. Frank titled &quot;Hormonal Causes of Premenstrual Tension&quot;. He incorrectly attributed premenstrual symptoms to an excess of the newly discovered sex hormone, estrogen.

The specific name &quot;premenstrual syndrome&quot; first appeared in the medical literature in 1953. At that time, medical researchers incorrectly thought that PMS was caused by a deficiency in progesterone.

Since at least the 1990s, when PMDD became accepted, the definitions of PMS have focused on psychological symptoms. Throughout the history of PMS, many of the symptoms associated with it have been stereotypical feminine behaviors, such as expressing emotions or &quot;nagging&quot;.

Since then, PMS has been a continuous presence in popular culture, occupying a place that is larger than the research attention accorded it as a medical diagnosis. Some have argued that women are partially responsible for the medicalization of PMS. They claim that women are partially responsible for legitimizing this disorder and have thus contributed to the social construction of PMS as an illness. The public debate over PMS and PMDD may have been affected by organizations who had a stake in the outcome including feminists, the American Psychiatric Association, physicians and scientists. 

==Alternative views==
Some supporters of PMS as a social construct believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD is a product of brain chemistry, and PMS is a product of culture, i.e. a culture-bound syndrome. Women are socially conditioned to expect PMS, or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly. Becoming educated about PMS narrows their interpretation of their experiences by teaching them that certain symptoms are accepted as part of PMS, and that other symptoms are not, even though an accepted symptom might be unrelated to PMS for that woman (who might have a different medical condition), and an excluded symptom might be part of PMS, but not mentioned because they did not think it was relevant. Social psychologist Carol Tavris also says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness.

The identification of PMS as a medical disorder has been criticized as inappropriate medicalization. These critics are concerned that society is pathologizing the menstrual cycle itself, even when the signs and symptoms are non-disruptive.

The view of PMS as primarily a psychological situation, rather than primarily a biologically driven, medical condition dominated by physical symptoms, has also been criticized. This view makes it harder to address psychosocial factors, such as external stress and a lack of social support, that exacerbate premenstrual symptoms. Treating PMS as a psychological situation also makes it difficult to address menstrual exacerbation of other conditions, including catamenial epilepsy, menstrual migraine, and cyclical asthma.

The limitation of PMS to premenstrual symptoms, rather than having a diagnosis that covers all symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle, has also been criticized. Critics of this limitation think that excluding common physical symptoms that appear during the menstrual phase, such as period pain, fatigue, and back pain, is an arbitrary distinction that tends to reinforce the view of PMS as primarily an emotional problem, rather than a biological one. They propose a focus on perimenstrual symptoms instead of strictly pre-menstrual ones.
==Research directions==
Open research questions related to treatment include how to predict who will respond to SSRIs, which non-drug treatments are effective, and how to manage people who have PMS in addition to other medical conditions.

Researchers are also working towards a single, uniform set of diagnostic criteria and to identify any objective characteristics that could be useful for diagnosis, such as any possible genetic predisposition.

<text>Temples are an English rock band, formed in Kettering, England in 2012 by singer and guitarist James Bagshaw and bassist Tom Walmsley. The band&#x27;s lineup was later completed with the addition of keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Adam Smith and drummer Rens Ottink.

They have released four studio albums, two EPs, and a number of singles. Their debut album, &quot;Sun Structures&quot;, was released in 2014 and charted at number seven in the UK. They are signed to ATO Records and have toured internationally both as a support act and as the headliner.

==History==
The band was initially formed as a home studio project in mid 2012. Walmsley and Bagshaw had known each other for years before these projects. It was at this point that they were in rival bands based in their hometown of Kettering. The duo had later worked together in The Moons, with Bagshaw also having sessioned with the Lightning Seeds and co-fronted another earlier Kettering band Sukie who formed in 2006 and charted at No 1 in the UK Indie Chart with their debut single &quot;Pink-A-Pade&quot;. Sukie were featured in the fanzine &quot;Siren&quot;, edited and created by Walmsley to document Kettering&#x27;s music scene.

The duo uploaded four self-produced tracks to YouTube, which caught the attention of Heavenly Recordings founder Jeff Barrett, who agreed to release the band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Shelter Song&quot; in November 2012. They then enlisted fellow Kettering resident drummer, Samuel Lloyd Toms (Secret Fix, ex-Koolaid Electric Company) and keyboard player Adam Smith and started rehearsing as a band, so they could play their songs live, having never played live as a band before. The band released their second single &quot;Colours To Life&quot; in June 2013.
In an interview with Sound of Boston, lead vocalist James Bagshaw noted that signing on to Heavenly Records did not change their recording process. &quot;Nothing changed, everything stayed exactly the same... At no point did they say, you know, go into the studio. If they did, we probably wouldn’t have signed to them because we liked the idea of what we were doing,&quot; Bagshaw stated. Temples&#x27; personal gear during recording comes from various gear from Vox and Orange Amps, along with synthesizers like the Roland VK-8 Combo Organ. 

Bagshaw also commented on the difficulty in selecting which tracks to release as singles. The melodic nature of &quot;Mesmerise&quot; was a main reason why Temples chose to release it as a single; &quot;I guess melody is something that assigns a single because that’s the thing that people listen to. But for us, we always found it very hard to choose singles… it might not be commercially viable, but that one sounds more catchy,&quot; said Bagshaw.

Having played major UK and European festival and supported the likes of Suede, Mystery Jets, Kasabian and The Vaccines alongside select headline dates, the band announced their first headline UK tour to take place in October 2013. In November 2013, Temples announced their self-produced debut album, &quot;Sun Structures&quot;, which was released on 5 February 2014. The band embarked on a headlining tour around Europe, North America, and Australia. On 30 July 2014, the band performed for the first time on US television performing &quot;Shelter Song&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. Temples also performed &quot;Shelter Song&quot; on &quot;The Ellen Degeneres Show&quot; on 29 September 2014.

On 30 September 2014, their song “Mesmerise” was featured in the Forza Horizon 2 soundtrack.

The band&#x27;s relative lack of airplay on major radio stations in the UK, especially BBC Radio 1, has been criticized by fellow musician and fan Noel Gallagher.

They debuted two new songs live in 2015, entitled &#x27;Henry&#x27;s Cake&#x27; and &#x27;Volcano/Savior&#x27; respectively. The band confirmed that they were working on a new album via Instagram on 9 July 2015. The band spent much of the first half of 2016 recording new material before embarking on a number of European festival dates. On 26 September 2016 the band announced a new single, &quot;Certainty&quot;.

The band released their second studio album, &quot;Volcano&quot;, on 3 March 2017.

In early 2018, drummer Samuel Toms left the band to concentrate on his solo project Secret Fix, and has gone on to join Fat White Family. The band have made no announcement regarding Toms&#x27; departure, with Toms himself only confirming his departure in December 2018 months after the band had toured with PAUW drummer Rens Ottink and released press shots with just the other three band members. Toms acknowledged that fans were contacting him regarding his departure from the band, as the band had made no comment. Toms admitted that he was asked to leave the band for reasons he did not wish to divulge, but also claimed that he had been thinking of leaving the band since shortly after joining the band, as he was not able nor allowed to contribute musically. The band also parted ways with Heavenly Recordings in 2018.

Temples&#x27; third studio album, &quot;Hot Motion,&quot; was released by ATO Records on 3 September 2019. Their fourth album, &quot;Exotico&quot;, was released on 14 April 2023.

<doc id="217961" wikidata="Q2915911" url="?curid=217961" title="Twinkie defense">
<text>&quot;Twinkie defense&quot; is a derisive label for an improbable legal defense. It is not a recognized legal defense in jurisprudence, but a catch-all term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant Dan White for the murders of San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. White&#x27;s defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of his depression, a symptom of which was a change in diet from healthy food to Twinkies and other sugary foods. Contrary to common belief, White&#x27;s attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White&#x27;s actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression. The product itself was only mentioned in passing during the trial. White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than first-degree murder, and served five years in prison.

==Origin==

The expression derives from the 1979 trial of Dan White, a former San Francisco police officer and firefighter who was serving as a city district supervisor up until assassinating Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk on November 27, 1978. At the trial, psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White had been depressed at the time of the crime, and pointed to several behavioral changes indicating White&#x27;s depression: he had quit his job; he shunned his wife; and although normally clean-cut, he had become slovenly in appearance. Furthermore, White had previously been a fitness fanatic and health food advocate, but had begun consuming junk food and sugar-laden soft drinks like Coca-Cola. As an incidental note, Blinder mentioned theories that elements of diet could worsen existing mood swings. Another psychiatrist, George Solomon, testified that White had &quot;exploded&quot; and was &quot;sort of on automatic pilot&quot; at the time of the killings. The fact that White had killed Moscone and Milk was not challenged, but – in part because of the testimony from Blinder and other psychiatrists – the defense successfully convinced the jury that White&#x27;s capacity for rational thought had been diminished; the jurors found White incapable of the premeditation required for a murder conviction, and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter. Public protests over the verdict led to the White Night Riots.

== Diminished capacity ==

Twinkies were only mentioned incidentally in the courtroom during the White trial, and junk food was a minor aspect of the defense presentation. The defense did not claim that White was on a sugar rush and committed the murders as a result. However, one reporter&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Twinkie defense&quot; became popular, leading to a persistent misunderstanding by the public. The mistaken understanding was reiterated at the end of &quot;Milk&quot;, Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 2008 biopic of Harvey Milk. In a bonus feature on the DVD version of &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&quot;, a documentary on Milk&#x27;s life and death, White&#x27;s lawyers explain what they actually argued in court.

The actual legal defense that White&#x27;s lawyers used was that his mental capacity had been diminished, and White&#x27;s consumption of junk food was presented to the jury as one of many &quot;symptoms&quot;, not a &quot;cause&quot;, of White&#x27;s depression.

In stories covering the trial, satirist Paul Krassner had played up the angle of the Twinkie, and he would later claim credit for coining the term &quot;Twinkie defense&quot;. The day after the verdict, columnist Herb Caen wrote in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; about the police support for White, himself a former policeman, and their &quot;dislike of homosexuals&quot; and mentioned &quot;the Twinkie insanity defense&quot; in passing. News stories published after the trial, however, frequently reported the defense arguments inaccurately, claiming that the defense had presented junk food as the cause of White&#x27;s depression and/or diminished capacity, instead of having been symptomatic of an existing depression. Dan White committed suicide seven years later.

As a result of negative publicity from the White case and others, the term &quot;diminished capacity&quot; was abolished in 1982 by Proposition8 and the California legislature and was replaced by the term &quot;diminished actuality&quot;, referring not to the capacity to have a specific intent, but to whether the defendant actually had the required intent to commit the crime. Additionally, California&#x27;s statutory definitions of premeditation and malice required for murder were eliminated by the state&#x27;s legislature, with the return to common law definitions. By this time, the &quot;Twinkie defense&quot; had become such a common term that one lawmaker had waved a Twinkie in the air while making his point during a debate.

==Supreme Court==
During oral Supreme Court arguments in &quot;United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez&quot;, 548 U.S. 140 (2006), Justice Antonin Scalia referred to the Twinkie defense with regard to the right to counsel of choice as perhaps more important than the right to effective assistance of counsel: &quot;I don&#x27;t want a competent lawyer. I want a lawyer who&#x27;s going to get me off. I want a lawyer who will invent the Twinkie defense. ... I would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention of a competent lawyer. But I want a lawyer who&#x27;s going to win for me&quot;.

<text>10BROAD36 is an obsolete computer network standard in the Ethernet family. It was developed during the 1980s and specified in IEEE 802.3b-1985. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standards committee IEEE 802 published the standard that was ratified in 1985 as an additional section 11 to the base Ethernet standard. It was also issued as ISO/IEC 8802-3 in 1989.

The standard supports 10 Mbit/s Ethernet signals over standard 75 ohm cable television (CATV) cable over a 3600-meter range. 10BROAD36 modulates its data onto a higher frequency carrier signal, much as an audio signal would modulate a carrier signal to be transmitted in a radio station. In telecommunications engineering, this is a broadband signaling technique. Broadband provides several advantages over the baseband signal used, for instance in 10BASE5. Range is greatly extended (, versus for 10BASE5), and multiple signals can be carried on the same cable. 10BROAD36 can even share a cable with standard television channels.

==Deployment==
10BROAD36 was less successful than its contemporaries because of the high equipment complexity (and cost) associated with it. The individual stations are much more expensive due to the extra radio frequency circuitry involved; however the primary extra complexity comes from the fact that 10BROAD36 is unidirectional. Signals can only travel one direction along the line, so head-end stations must be present on the line to repeat the signals (ensuring that no packets travel through the line indefinitely) on either another, backwards direction frequency on the same line, or another line entirely. This also increases latency and prevents bidirectional signal flow.

The extra complexity outweighed the advantage of reusability of CATV technology for the intended campus networks and metropolitan area networks. An installer at Boston University using the Ungermann-Bass product noted that no installers understood both the digital and analog aspects of the system.
In wide area networks it was quickly replaced by fiber-optic communication alternatives, such as 100BASE-FX (which provided ten times the data rate). Interest in cable modems was revived for residential Internet access, through later technologies such as Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) introduced in the 1990s and is still widely used today.

<doc id="217982" wikidata="Q311638" url="?curid=217982" title="Caddyshack">
<text>Caddyshack is a 1980 American sports comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, written by Brian Doyle-Murray, Ramis and Douglas Kenney, and starring Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight (his final film role), Michael O&#x27;Keefe and Bill Murray with supporting roles by Sarah Holcomb, Cindy Morgan, and Doyle-Murray. It tells the story of a caddie, vying for a caddie scholarship, who becomes involved in a feud on the links between one of the country club&#x27;s founders and a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; guest. A subplot involves a greenskeeper who uses extreme methods against an elusive gopher.

&quot;Caddyshack&quot; was the directorial debut of Ramis and the film boosted the career of Dangerfield, who was then known primarily as a stand-up comedian. Grossing nearly $40 million at the domestic box office (the 17th-highest of the year), it was the first of a series of similar &quot;slob vs. snob&quot; comedies.

The film has a cult following and was described by ESPN as &quot;perhaps the funniest sports movie ever made&quot;.

A sequel titled &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988) followed, although only Chase reprised his role; it was panned by critics and a box-office bomb.

==Plot==
High school student Danny Noonan is anxious about his future, while he hopes to go to college to avoid being stuck in a menial job with no prospects, he is struggling to financially cover tuition. Danny works as a caddie at the exclusive Bushwood country club catering to affluent clientele. Though he usually caddies for Ty Webb, a talented golfer and the free-spirited playboy son of the club&#x27;s co-founder, Danny volunteers to caddie for the arrogant Judge Elihu Smails, the club&#x27;s other co-founder and director of the caddie college scholarship program. Meanwhile, mentally unstable greenskeeper Carl Spackler is tasked with killing a destructive gopher driven onto the course by work on the adjacent property development owned by Al Czervik.

The fiery and eccentric nouveau riche Czervik attends the club as a guest, but his antics quickly annoy Smails. After one encounter, Smails angrily throws his putter, injuring an elderly guest. Danny takes the blame for the incident to earn respect from Smails. At Bushwood&#x27;s annual Fourth of July banquet, Danny and his girlfriend Maggie work as wait staff. Danny becomes attracted to Smails&#x27;s promiscuous niece Lacey Underall who is visiting for the summer; she and Webb begin a brief affair.

Later, Danny wins the Caddie Day golf tournament, earning him an invitation from Smails to attend the christening ceremony for his boat at the nearby Rolling Lakes Yacht Club. There, Czervik disrupts the ceremony and accidentally destroys the boat, while Lacey seduces Danny and the pair go to Smails&#x27; house to have sex. Smails returns home and catches them, enraging him as he chases Danny out of the house. Expecting to be fired and have the scholarship revoked, Danny is surprised when Smails only demands that he keeps the misadventure a secret in exchange for receiving the scholarship.

Unable to tolerate the uncouth Czervik&#x27;s presence any longer, Smails announces that Czervik will never be granted membership. Czervik counters that he would never consider being a member and is only interested in buying the club. After an exchange of insults, Czervik proposes a team golf match with Smails and his regular golfing partner Dr. Beeper against Czervik and Webb. Although Webb is reluctant to play for money, he agrees to join, and antagonizes Smails by saying that Webb&#x27;s father never liked Smails. Against club rules, they agree to a $20,000 wager on the match, which quickly doubles to $40,000.

During the match the following day, Danny caddies for Smails but becomes frustrated with his constant cheating. Word spreads of the wager drawing a crowd of club members and employees to observe the game. Smails and Beeper take the lead while both Czervik and Webb struggle. Czervik reacts to Smails&#x27; heckling by impulsively doubling the wager to $80,000 per team. When his own ricocheting ball strikes his arm, Czervik feigns an injury in hopes of having the contest declared a draw but learns his team will forfeit unless they find a substitute. Webb selects Danny, which prompts Smails to revoke the scholarship, but after Czervik promises to compensate Danny, he readily agrees to take Czervik&#x27;s place.

At the final hole, the score is tied. Judge Smails scores a birdie, requiring Danny to complete a difficult putt to draw even. Czervik raises the bet, offering double or nothing on Danny making the putt, which Smails accepts. Danny&#x27;s putt leaves the ball teetering over the edge of the hole seemingly costing him the game. At that moment, in his latest attempt to kill the gopher, Carl detonates plastic explosives that he has rigged around the golf course, shaking the ground and causing the ball to drop into the hole, handing Danny, Webb, and Czervik victory. Meanwhile, Carl coyly leaves the area after seeing the destruction his explosives have caused. Czervik demands the money from Smails, but he refuses to honor the bet. Figuring this would happen, Czervik sends enforcers after Smails to ensure he pays up. Afterwards, he tells the crowd gathered at the main house that they are all going to get laid. The crowd celebrates.

Elsewhere on the course, the gopher emerges from underground unharmed and dances to the song &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; by Kenny Loggins.
==Cast==
==Production==
The film was inspired by writer and co-star Brian Doyle-Murray&#x27;s memories of working as a caddie at Indian Hill Club in Winnetka, Illinois. His brothers Bill and John Murray (production assistant and a caddy extra) and director Harold Ramis also had worked as caddies when they were teenagers. Many of the characters in the film were based on characters they had encountered through their various experiences at the club, including a young woman upon whom the character of Maggie is based and the Haverkamps, a doddering old couple, John and Ilma, longtime members of the club, who can barely hit the ball out of their shadows. The scene in which Al Czervik hits Judge Smails in the genitals with a struck golf ball happened to Ramis on what he said was the second of his two rounds of golf, on a nine-hole public course.

The film was shot over eleven weeks during the autumn of 1979; Hurricane David in early September delayed production. Golf scenes were filmed at the Rolling Hills Golf Club (now the Grande Oaks Golf Club) in Davie, Florida. According to Ramis, Rolling Hills was chosen because the course did not have any palm trees. He wanted the film to feel that it was in the Midwest, not Florida. The explosions that take place during the climax of the film were reported at the nearby Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport by an incoming pilot, who suspected that a plane had crashed. The Fourth of July dinner-and-dancing scene was filmed at the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Boca Raton, Florida.

The scene that begins when Ty Webb&#x27;s golf ball crashes into Carl Spackler&#x27;s shack was not in the original script. It was added by director Harold Ramis after realizing that two of his biggest stars, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, did not appear in a scene together. The three met for lunch and wrote the scene. While there were some worries about how Chase and Murray would act around one another, due to their rivalry while working together on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the two remained friendly and professional with one another throughout the whole writing and filming of the scene. This is the only film in which Chase and Murray have appeared together.

Murray improvised much of the &quot;Cinderella story&quot; scene based on two lines of stage direction. Ramis gave him direction to act as a child. Murray hit flowers with a grass whip while fantasizing aloud about winning the Masters Tournament, a major golf tournament. Murray was with the production only six days, and his lines were largely unscripted. Murray was working on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the time, and was not intended to have a large role but his part &quot;mushroomed&quot; and he was repeatedly recalled from New York to film additional scenes as production continued.

Cindy Morgan said that a massage scene with Chevy Chase was improvised, and her reaction to Chase dousing her back with the massage oil, where she exclaimed &quot;You&#x27;re crazy!&quot; was genuine. A scene in which her character dove into the pool was acted by a professional diver. Before the diver took over, she was led to the diving board by the crew and carefully directed up the ladder since she could not wear her contact lenses near the pool and was legally blind without them.

A deal was made with John Dykstra&#x27;s effects company for visual effects, including lightning, stormy sky effects, flying golf balls and disappearing greens&#x27; flags. The gopher was part of the effects package. Dykstra&#x27;s technicians added hydraulic animation to the puppet, including ear movement, and built the tunnels through which it moved.

The production became infamous for the amount of drug usage which occurred on set, with supporting actor Peter Berkrot describing cocaine as &quot;the fuel that kept the film running.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Caddyshack&quot; was released on July 25, 1980, in 656 theaters, and grossed $3.1 million during its opening weekend; it went on to make $39,846,344 in North America, and $60 million worldwide.

The film was met with underwhelming reviews in its original release, with criticism towards the disorganized plot, though Dangerfield&#x27;s, Chase&#x27;s, and Murray&#x27;s comic performances were well received. Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;&quot;Caddyshack&quot; feels more like a movie that was written rather loosely, so that when shooting began there was freedom—too much freedom—for it to wander off in all directions in search of comic inspiration.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three out of four stars, saying it was &quot;funny about half of the time it tries to be, which is a pretty good average for a comedy.&quot; Dave Kehr, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, wrote, &quot;The first-time director, Harold Ramis, can&#x27;t hold it together: the picture lurches from style to style (including some ill-placed whimsy with a gopher puppet) and collapses somewhere between sitcom and sketch farce.&quot; Vincent Canby gave it a mixed review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describing it as &quot;A pleasantly loose-limbed sort of movie with some comic moments, most of them belonging to Mr. Dangerfield.&quot;

Nevertheless, the film has gained a cult following in the years after its release and has been positively reappraised by many film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 62 reviews, with an average score of 6.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though unabashedly crude and juvenile, &quot;Caddyshack&quot; nevertheless scores with its classic slapstick, unforgettable characters, and endlessly quotable dialogue.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 48 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Christopher Null gave the film four stars out of five in his 2005 review, and wrote, &quot;They don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like this anymore … The plot wanders around the golf course and involves a half-dozen elements, but if you simply dig the gopher, the caddy, and the Dangerfield, you&#x27;re not going to be doing half bad.&quot;

Ramis noted in the DVD documentary that &quot;TV Guide&quot; had originally given the film two stars (out of four) when it began showing on cable television in the early 1980s, but over time the rating had gone up to three stars. In 2009, he said, &quot;I can barely watch it. All I see are a bunch of compromises and things that could have been better,&quot; such as the poor swings of everyone, except for O&#x27;Keefe.

Denmark was the only place outside the United States where &quot;Caddyshack&quot; was initially a hit. The distributor had cut 20 minutes to emphasize Bill Murray&#x27;s role.

===Accolades===
This film is also second on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies.&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

==Soundtrack==

In anticipation of the movie, the Kenny Loggins single &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; was released nearly three weeks before the movie opened and became a top ten hit the last week of September 1980. CBS Records also issued a soundtrack to &quot;Caddyshack&quot; later that year. It included ten songs, four of which were performed by Kenny Loggins, including &quot;I&#x27;m Alright.&quot;

==Sequel ==
There was a sequel called &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988) which performed poorly at the box office and is considered one of the worst sequels of all time. Only Chevy Chase reprised his role.

==Books==
In 2007, Taylor Trade Publishing released &quot;The Book of Caddyshack&quot;, an illustrated paperback retrospective of the movie, with cast and crew Q&amp;A interviews. The book was written by Scott Martin.

In April 2018, Flatiron Books published &quot;Caddyshack: The Making of a Hollywood Cinderella Story&quot; by Chris Nashawaty, detailing the making of the film.

==Caddyshack restaurants==
On June 7, 2001, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray and their brothers opened a themed restaurant inspired by the film at the World Golf Village, near St. Augustine, Florida. The restaurant is meant to resemble the fictional Bushwood Country Club, and serves primarily American cuisine. The brothers are all active partners and make occasional appearances at the restaurant. Three more Caddyshack restaurants were opened, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Orlando; and Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. These are now closed, leaving the original in St. Augustine their flagship location, open to fans and diners.

Bill Murray and two of his brothers, Andy and Joel, were in attendance when another venue opened in Rosemont, Illinois, in April 2018.

==Popular culture==
Many of the film&#x27;s quotes are part of popular culture, with many fans able to recite the movie line for line and merchandise is still licensed and sold by several companies as of 2024. FunkoPop produced several figures in 2019, as well as a set exclusive to Target.

Tiger Woods said that he liked the film, and played Spackler in an American Express commercial based on the film.

The University of Minnesota uses part of the film as a dance sport ritual for athletics, encouraging fans at collegiate sports games to &quot;Do the Gopher&quot; and imitate the dancing gopher, referenced because of mascot Goldy Gopher.

In 2016, Bret Baier in a Fox News interview asked the Dalai Lama whether he had seen the movie, referencing a scene where the Dalai Lama is mentioned in comical story told by assistant groundkeeper Carl Spackler. The Dalai Lama responded he had not seen the movie, and while he had played badminton, he had never played golf.

A 2023 Super Bowl commercial for alcohol brand Michelob featured modern athletes recreating scenes from the film.

<text>Bus, Buss, or Busse Island was a phantom island in the North Atlantic Ocean. It was recorded as discovered during the third expedition of Martin Frobisher in September 1578 by sailors aboard the ship &quot;Emanuel&quot; of Bridgwater (a &quot;busse&quot;) and was indicated on maps as existing between Ireland and mythical Frisland at about 57° N. The island was then named for the type of vessel that its discoverers used. It is believed that Frobisher took Greenland for Frisland and Baffin Island for Greenland and &quot;Emanuel&quot;, returning home, made a mistake in dead reckoning and mistook optical effects near Greenland at around 62° N for new land.

A Thomas Shepard claimed to have explored and mapped the island from &quot;Golden Lion&quot; of Dunkirk in 1671. As Atlantic traffic increased, the island&#x27;s existence was less certain and its supposed size was greatly reduced. By 1745, it was apparent there was no island at the site claimed and it was renamed the Sunken Land of Buss, as the supposed area was relatively shallow. The island or &#x27;site of sunken island&#x27; persisted on charts into the 19th century. Its existence at the location was finally disproved by John Ross in &quot;Isabella&quot; in 1818 during his first Arctic expedition, finding no depth at .

<text>The Reichstag Fire Decree () is the common name of the Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State () issued by German President Paul von Hindenburg on the advice of Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 28 February 1933 in immediate response to the Reichstag fire. The decree nullified many of the key civil liberties of German citizens. With the Nazis in powerful positions in the German government, the decree was used as the legal basis for the imprisonment of anyone considered to be opponents of the Nazis, and to suppress publications not considered &quot;friendly&quot; to the Nazi cause. The decree is considered by historians as one of the key steps in the establishment of a one-party Nazi state in Germany.

== Background ==
Hitler had been appointed Chancellor of Germany only four weeks previously, on 30 January 1933, when he was invited by President von Hindenburg to lead a coalition government. Hitler&#x27;s government had urged von Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and to call elections for 5 March.

On the evening of 27 February 1933—six days before the parliamentary election—fire broke out in the Reichstag chambers. While the exact circumstances of the fire remain unclear to this day, what is clear is that Hitler and his supporters capitalised quickly on the fire to consolidate their power. Hitler almost immediately blamed the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) for causing the blaze, and believed the fire would result in increased support for the Nazis. According to Rudolf Diels, Hitler was heard shouting through the fire &quot;these sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses.&quot;

The Nazis framed the burning of the Reichstag building as an opening salvo in a communist uprising, capitalizing on the fear of communism commonly held across German society. The official account stated:
The burning of the Reichstag was intended to be the signal for a bloody uprising and civil war. Large-scale pillaging in Berlin was planned for as early as four o&#x27;clock in the morning on Tuesday. It has been determined that starting today throughout Germany acts of terrorism were to begin against prominent individuals, against private property, against the lives and safety of the peaceful population, and general civil war was to be unleashed…
Within hours of the fire, dozens of Communists had been thrown into jail. The next day, officials in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior, which was led by Hermann Göring, discussed ways to provide legal cover for the arrests. Ludwig Grauert, the chief of the Prussian state police, proposed an emergency presidential decree under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take any measure necessary to protect public safety without the consent of the Reichstag. It would have suspended most civil liberties under the pretence of preventing further Communist violence. There had already been discussions within the Cabinet about enacting such measures. Justice Minister Franz Gürtner, a member of the Nazis&#x27; coalition partner, the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), had actually brought a draft decree before the cabinet on the afternoon of 27 February.

When the proposed decree was brought before the Reich Cabinet, Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, the only Nazi in the cabinet who had a portfolio, added a clause that would allow the cabinet to take over the state governments if they failed to maintain order. Notably, the cabinet would have been allowed to do this on its own authority. Frick was well aware that the Interior portfolio had been given to the Nazis because it was almost powerless; unlike his counterparts in the rest of Europe, he had no power over the police. He saw a chance to extend his power over the states and thus begin the process of Nazifying the country.

At an emergency cabinet meeting, Hitler declared that the fire now made it a matter of &quot;ruthless confrontation of the KPD&quot;—a confrontation that could not be &quot;made dependent on judicial considerations.&quot; Though Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen objected to the clause giving the Reich cabinet the power to take over the state governments if necessary, the decree was approved. Shortly thereafter, President von Hindenburg signed the decree into law.

The decree consisted of six articles. Article 1 indefinitely suspended most of the civil liberties set forth in the Weimar Constitution, including &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, inviolability of residence, secrecy of the post and telephone, freedom of expression and of the press, the right to public assembly, and the right of free association, as well as the protection of property and the home. Articles 2 and 3 allowed the Reich government to assume powers normally reserved for the federal states. Articles 4 and 5 established penalties for certain offenses, including the death penalty for arson to public buildings. Article 6 simply stated that the decree took effect on the day of its proclamation.

==Text of the decree==
The preamble and Article 1 of the Reichstag Fire Decree show the methods by which the civil rights enshrined in the Weimar Constitution were legally abolished by the Hitler Government:


== Effects ==
The decree was not accompanied by any written guidelines from the Reich government; this omission gave wide latitude in interpreting the decree to Nazis like Göring, who as Prussian interior minister was the commander of the largest police force in Germany. The &quot;Länder&quot; (German states) not yet in the Nazis&#x27; grasp largely restricted themselves to banning the Communist press, Communist meetings and demonstrations, and detaining leading KPD officials. In Prussia, however, summary arrests of KPD leaders were common, thousands were imprisoned in the days following the fire, and the total number of arrests in Prussia on the basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree in the two weeks following 28 February is believed to be in the vicinity of 10,000. Göring had actually employed such tactics even &quot;before&quot; the decree, only to have them thrown out by the courts—a check that no longer had any effect with the decree in place.

Among the German communists arrested on the basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree was KPD chairman Ernst Thälmann; while KPD founding members Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht—later to be leaders in postwar East Germany—were among those who escaped arrest and lived in exile.

Göring issued a directive to the Prussian police authorities on 3 March, stating that in addition to the constitutional rights stripped by the decree, &quot;all other restraints on police action imposed by Reich and State law&quot; were abolished &quot;so far as this is necessary … to achieve the purpose of the decree.&quot; Göring went on to say that
In keeping with the purpose and aim of the decree the additional measures … will be directed against the Communists in the first instance, but then also against those who co-operate with the Communists and who support or encourage their criminal aims. … I would point out that any necessary measures against members or establishments of other than Communist, anarchist or Social Democratic parties can only be justified by the decree … if they serve to help the defense against such Communist activities in the widest sense.
Within two weeks of the Reichstag Fire Decree taking effect, Reich Commissars were sent out to take over the other states; the heavy-handed repression that was occurring in Prussia quickly spread to the rest of the Reich.

Despite the virulent rhetoric directed against the Communists, the Nazis did not formally ban the KPD right away. Not only did they fear a violent uprising, but they hoped the KPD&#x27;s presence on the ballot would siphon off votes from the Social Democratic Party (SPD). However, while the KPD managed to win 81 seats, it was an open secret that the KPD deputies would never be allowed to take their seats; they were thrown in jail as quickly as the police could track them down. Increasingly, the courts treated KPD membership as an act of treason. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the KPD was banned as of 6 March, the day after the election.

Just over three weeks after the passage of the Reichstag Fire Decree, Hitler further tightened his grasp on Germany by the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933. This act gave Hitler&#x27;s cabinet the power to decree laws without the approval of the Reichstag—effectively giving Hitler dictatorial powers. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis did not even count the arrested KPD deputies for the purposes of determining a quorum. They also used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to detain several SPD deputies while many others fled into exile. All of this ensured that the Enabling Act would pass with over 85 percent of the deputies who were present and voting, far more than the two-thirds majority required in the constitution. As it turned out, the session took place in such an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that it would have most likely had the required majority even if all KPD and SPD deputies had been present.

In his book, &quot;The Coming of the Third Reich,&quot; British historian Richard J. Evans argued that the Enabling Act was legally invalid, in part because of the Reich Commissars&#x27; role in Nazifying the states. Evans argued that the states were &quot;not properly constituted or represented&quot; in the Reichsrat, and therefore that chamber&#x27;s vote to pass the Enabling Act was &quot;irregular.&quot;

In theory, Article 48 gave the Reichstag the power to demand the cancellation of the measures taken to enforce the Reichstag Fire Decree. However, any realistic chance of it being cancelled ended in July; by this time the other parties had either been banned outright or intimidated into dissolving themselves, and the Nazi Party had been declared the only legal party in Germany.

The Reichstag Fire Decree remained in force for the duration of the Nazi era, allowing Hitler to rule under what amounted to martial law. Along with the Enabling Act, it formed the legal basis for Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship. Thousands of Hitler&#x27;s decrees, such as those which turned Germany into a one-party state, were explicitly based on its authority, and hence on Article 48. This was a major reason Hitler never formally abolished the Weimar Constitution, though it no longer had any substantive value after the passage of the Enabling Act. 

The Nazis&#x27; use of the Reichstag Fire Decree to give their dictatorship the appearance of legality, combined with the broader misuse of Article 48, was fresh on the minds of framers of the postwar Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. They opted to significantly curb the powers of the president, to the point that they have little &quot;de facto&quot; executive power.

<doc id="218003" wikidata="Q2553654" url="?curid=218003" title="Elegant variation">
<text>Elegant variation is the use of synonyms to avoid repetition or add variety. The term was introduced in 1906 by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler in &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot;. In their meaning of the term, they focus particularly on instances when the word being avoided is a noun or its pronoun. Pronouns are themselves variations intended to avoid awkward repetition, and variations are so often not necessary, that they should be used only when needed. The Fowlers recommend that &quot;variations should take place only when there is some awkwardness, such as ambiguity or noticeable monotony, in the word avoided&quot;.

==History==

Henry Fowler&#x27;s later &quot;Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, published in 1926, keeps the same definition, but more explicitly cautions against overuse of variations or synonyms by writers who are &quot;intent on expressing themselves prettily&quot;, rather than &quot;conveying their meaning clearly&quot;, adding that &quot;there are few literary faults so prevalent.&quot; Fowler then quotes examples of when variations should have been used, and when they should not have been used.

Since the term was established in 1906, it has been referred to in style and usage guides, but the original meaning has seen a number of variations. For example Bryan A. Garner suggests that when Fowler uses the word &quot;elegant&quot;, he actually means the opposite—&quot;inelegant&quot;—because, according to Garner, at the time Fowler wrote, the word &quot;elegant&quot; was an &quot;almost pejorative&quot; word. Garner also claims that Fowler used the term elegant variation to refer to the &quot;practice of never using the same word twice in the same sentence or passage&quot;. That is not Fowler&#x27;s definition, and, as Richard W. Bailey points out, in misrepresenting Fowler, &quot;Garner has created a linguist made of straw&quot;. Nevertheless, following Garner, &quot;inelegant variation&quot; has been used by others, including Gerald Lebovits and Wayne Schiess.

==Examples==
* In &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; (1906), H. W. Fowler gives as an example this passage from &quot;The Times&quot;:
:The Emperor, His Majesty, and the Monarch all refer to the same person. Fowler points out that such extreme variations make it difficult to follow the sense of the sentence when the reader is distracted by &quot;wondering what the King will be called next time&quot;. If a writer must choose between &quot;monotonous repetition&quot; and &quot;clumsy variation&quot;, which are both undesirable, Fowler suggests picking the one that seems natural.

* Among sub-editors at &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;gratuitous synonyms&quot; are called &quot;povs&quot;, an acronym of &quot;popular orange vegetables&quot;—a phrase that was removed from the draft of an article about carrots in the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;. Charles W. Morton similarly wrote of an &quot;elongated yellow fruit&quot;, a presumed synonym of &quot;banana&quot; that was used in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;.
* &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot; cites examples given by Morton, including &quot;elongated yellow fruit&quot; and others: pool balls (&quot;the numbered spheroids&quot;); Bluebeard (&quot;the azure-whiskered wife slayer&quot;); Easter-egg hunt (&quot;hen-fruit safari&quot;); milk (&quot;lacteal fluid&quot;); oysters (&quot;succulent bivalves&quot;); peanut (&quot;the succulent goober&quot;); songbird (&quot;avian songster&quot;); truck (&quot;rubber-tired mastodon of the highway&quot;).
*The science fiction writing guide, &quot;Turkey City Lexicon&quot;, calls elegant variations the &quot;Burly Detective&quot; Syndrome after the character Mike Shayne who is called by euphemisms such as &quot;the burly detective&quot; or &quot;the red-headed sleuth&quot; in the series.

==In French==
In French the use of elegant variations is considered essential for good style. A humorist imagined writing a news article about Gaston Defferre: &quot;It&#x27;s OK to say Defferre once, but not twice. So next you say the Mayor of Marseille. Then, the Minister of Planning. Then, the husband of Edmonde. Then, Gaston. Then, Gastounet and then... Well, then you stop talking about him because you don&#x27;t know what to call him next.&quot;

<text>Mark Anthony Pivarunas (born 31 October 1958) is an American sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholic bishop and the Superior General of the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI).

==Biography==

===Early life and family===

Mark Anthony Pivarunas was born to his father, Walter Pivarunas, and to an ethnic Italian mother, on 31 October 1958, in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He was baptized on 7 December of the same year, in Seven Holy Founders Church in the same city. He received his first Communion on 7 May 1966, and was confirmed on 6 June 1967.

===Religious life===

Pivarunas entered the religious life in the sedevacantist Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI) in September 1974. After a year&#x27;s postulancy, he entered the novitiate on 8 September 1975, taking the religious name of Brother Mary Tarcisius. He made his first profession of vows on 12 September 1976. On 12 September 1980, he made his final profession of vows.

===Priesthood===

Pivarunas received the usual seminary training. On 27 June 1985, in the CMRI&#x27;s Mount Saint Michael, having received the commendation of his superiors, he, along with two others, was ordained a priest by Bishop George Musey.

===Superior Generalship===

In August 1989, Pivarunas, now thirty years old, was elected to the post of Superior General of the CMRI.

Pivarunas traveled extensively throughout Nebraska, United States, and into neighboring states to provide the Mass and sacraments.

===Episcopacy===

In January 1991, Bishop Moisés Carmona of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, another sedevacantist bishop whose episcopal lineage traces to Thục, visited Mount Saint Michael. Before his return to Mexico, on 1 February 1991, he left behind a letter expressing his desire to consecrate as bishop whomever the congregation chooses. On 3 April 1991, Pivarunas was elected to be consecrated a bishop.

In accordance with Catholic practice, he discontinued the use of his religious name, &quot;Tarcisius&quot;.

On 24 September 1991, in Mount Saint Michael, Pivarunas was consecrated a bishop by Carmona.

On 30 November 1993, in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, Pivarunas consecrated the sedevacantist Father Daniel Dolan a bishop.

On 11 May 1999, in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, with Dolan assisting as co-consecrator, Pivarunas consecrated Father Martín Dávila of the sedevacantist &quot;Sociedad Sacerdotal Trento&quot; (Priestly Society of Trent) a bishop.

Since his episcopal consecration, Pivarunas has traveled to the United States, Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, South America, and Europe to provide Confirmation and other sacraments to several thousand children and adults. According to the CMRI, there are over a hundred priests and Religious under his spiritual care.

<text>&quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; (1946) is an essay by George Orwell that criticised the &quot;ugly and inaccurate&quot; written English of his time and examined the connection between political orthodoxies and the debasement of language.

The essay focused on political language, which, according to Orwell, &quot;is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind&quot;. Orwell believed that the language used was necessarily vague or meaningless because it was intended to hide the truth rather than express it. This unclear prose was a &quot;contagion&quot; which had spread to those who did not intend to hide the truth, and it concealed a writer&#x27;s thoughts from himself and others. Orwell encourages concreteness and clarity instead of vagueness, and individuality over political conformity.

==Summary==

Orwell relates what he believes to be a close association between bad prose and oppressive ideology:

One of Orwell&#x27;s points is:

The insincerity of the writer perpetuates the decline of the language as people (particularly politicians, Orwell later notes) attempt to disguise their intentions behind euphemisms and convoluted phrasing. Orwell says that this decline is self-perpetuating. He argues that it is easier to think with poor English because the language is in decline; and, as the language declines, &quot;foolish&quot; thoughts become even easier, reinforcing the original cause:

Orwell discusses &quot;pretentious diction&quot; and &quot;meaningless words&quot;. &quot;Pretentious diction&quot; is used to make biases look impartial and scientific, while &quot;meaningless words&quot; are used to stop the reader from seeing the point of the statement. According to Orwell: &quot;In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.&quot;

===Five passages===
Orwell chooses five passages of text which &quot;illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer.&quot; The samples are: by Harold Laski (&quot;five negatives in 53 words&quot;), Lancelot Hogben (mixed metaphors), an essay by Paul Goodman on psychology in the July 1945 issue of &quot;Politics&quot; (&quot;simply meaningless&quot;), a communist pamphlet (&quot;an accumulation of stale phrases&quot;) and a reader&#x27;s letter in &quot;Tribune&quot; (in which &quot;words and meaning have parted company&quot;). From these, Orwell identifies a &quot;catalogue of swindles and perversions&quot; which he classifies as &quot;dying metaphors&quot;, &quot;operators or verbal false limbs&quot;, &quot;pretentious diction&quot; and &quot;meaningless words&quot;. &quot;(See cliches, prolixity, and weasel words.)&quot;

Orwell notes that writers of modern prose tend not to write in concrete terms but use a &quot;pretentious Latinized style&quot; &quot;(compare Anglish)&quot;. He claims writers find it is easier to gum together long strings of words than to pick words specifically for their meaningparticularly in political writing, where Orwell notes that &quot;[o]rthodoxy ... seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style&quot;. Political speech and writing are generally in defence of the indefensible and so lead to a euphemistic inflated style.

Orwell criticises bad writing habits which spread by imitation. He argues that writers must think more clearly because thinking clearly &quot;is a necessary first step toward political regeneration&quot;. He later emphasises that he was not &quot;considering the literary use of language, but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought&quot;.

===&quot;Translation&quot; of Ecclesiastes===
As a further example, Orwell &quot;translates&quot; Ecclesiastes 9:11:

– into &quot;modern English of the worst sort&quot;:

Orwell points out that this &quot;translation&quot; contains many more syllables but gives no concrete illustrations, as the original did, nor does it contain any vivid, arresting images or phrases.

The headmaster&#x27;s wife at St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Mrs. Cicely Vaughan Wilkes (nicknamed &quot;Flip&quot;), taught English to Orwell and used the same method to illustrate good writing to her pupils. She would use simple passages from the King James Bible and then &quot;translate&quot; them into poor English to show the clarity and brilliance of the original. Walter John Christie, who followed Orwell to Eton College, wrote that Vaughan Wilkes preached the virtues of &quot;simplicity, honesty, and avoidance of verbiage&quot;, and pointed out that the qualities &quot;Flip&quot; most prized were later to be seen in Orwell&#x27;s writing.

===Remedy of Six Rules===
Orwell said it was easy for his contemporaries to slip into bad writing of the sort he had described and that the temptation to use meaningless or hackneyed phrases was like a &quot;packet of aspirins always at one&#x27;s elbow&quot;. In particular, such phrases are always ready to form the writer&#x27;s thoughts, to save the writer the bother of thinkingor writingclearly. He did conclude though that the progressive decline of the English language was reversible and suggested six rules he claimed would prevent many of these faults, although &quot;one could keep all of them and still write bad English&quot;.

# Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. (Examples that Orwell gave included &quot;&quot;, &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;, &quot;swan song&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. He described such phrases as &quot;dying metaphors&quot; and argued that they were used without knowing what was truly being said. Furthermore, he said that using metaphors of this kind made the original meaning of the phrases meaningless because those who used them did not know their original meaning. He wrote that &quot;some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact&quot;.)
# Never use a long word where a short one will do.
# If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
# Never use the passive where you can use the active.
# Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
# Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

==Publication==
&quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; was first noted in Orwell&#x27;s payment book of 11 December 1945. The essay was originally published in the April 1946 issue of the journal &quot;Horizon&quot; and was Orwell&#x27;s last major article for the journal. The essay was originally intended for George Weidenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Contact&quot; magazine but it was turned down.

From the time of his wife&#x27;s death in March 1945 Orwell had maintained a high output rate, with some 130 literary contributions, many of them lengthy. &quot;Animal Farm&quot; had been published in August 1945 and Orwell was experiencing a time of critical and commercial literary success. He was seriously ill in February and desperate to get away from London to the island of Jura, Scotland, where he wanted to start work on &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

&quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; was published nearly simultaneously with another of Orwell&#x27;s essays, &quot;The Prevention of Literature&quot;. Both reflect Orwell&#x27;s concern with truth and how truth depends upon the use of language. Orwell noted the deliberate use of misleading language to hide unpleasant political and military facts and also identified a laxity of language among those he identified as pro-Soviet. In &quot;The Prevention of Literature&quot; he also speculated on the type of literature which, under a future totalitarian society, he predicted would be formulaic and low-grade sensationalism. Around the same time, Orwell wrote an unsigned editorial for &quot;Polemic&quot; in response to an attack from &quot;Modern Quarterly&quot;. In this he highlights the double-talk and appalling prose of J. D. Bernal in the same magazine, and cites Edmund Wilson&#x27;s damnation of the prose of Joseph E. Davies in &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In his biography of Orwell, Michael Shelden called the article &quot;his most important essay on style&quot;, while Bernard Crick made no reference to the work at all in his original biography, reserving his praise for Orwell&#x27;s essays in &quot;Polemic&quot;, which cover a similar political theme. John Rodden asserts, given that much of Orwell&#x27;s work was polemical, that he sometimes violated these rules and Orwell himself concedes that, if you look through his essay, &quot;for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against&quot;. Rodden also says that Terry Eagleton had praised the essay&#x27;s demystification of political language but later became disenchanted with Orwell.

Linguist Geoffrey Pullumdespite being an admirer of Orwell&#x27;s writing dismissed the essay as &quot;dishonest&quot; and criticised it for &quot;its insane and unfollowable insistence that good writing must avoid all phrases and word uses that are familiar&quot;. Orwell&#x27;s admonition to avoid using the passive voice has also been criticised. Merriam–Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage refers to three statistical studies of passive versus active sentences in various periodicals, stating: &quot;the highest incidence of passive constructions was 13 percent. Orwell runs to a little over 20 percent in &#x27;Politics and the English Language&#x27;. Clearly he found the construction useful in spite of his advice to avoid it as much as possible&quot;.

Introductory writing courses frequently cite this essay. A 1999 study found that it was reprinted 118 times in 325 editions of 58 readers published between 1946 and 1996 that were intended for use in college-level composition courses.

In 1981, Carl Freedman&#x27;s article &quot;Writing Ideology, and Politics: Orwell&#x27;s &#x27;Politics and the English Language&#x27; and English Composition&quot; set in motion a &quot;wide variety of critiques, reconsiderations, and outright attacks against the plain style&quot; that Orwell argues for. The main issue found was Orwell&#x27;s &quot;simplistic faith about thought and language existing in a dialectical relation with one another; others quickly cut to the chase by insisting that politics, rightly considered, meant the insertion of an undercutting &quot;whose&quot; before every value word the hegemony holds dear&quot;. These critics also began to question Orwell&#x27;s argument for the absoluteness of the English language, and asked whose values and truths were being represented through the language.

Louis Menand criticized the essay in a 2003 retrospective of the author in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, saying that Orwell &quot;makes it seem that the problem with fascism (and the rest) is, at bottom, a problem of style,&quot; that &quot;ugliness has no relation to insincerity or evil, and short words with Anglo-Saxon roots have no relation to truth or goodness.&quot; Menand continued, &quot;All politics, (Orwell) writes, &#x27;is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.&#x27; And by the end of the essay he has damned the whole discourse.&quot;

Orwell&#x27;s writings on the English language have had a large impact on classrooms, journalism and other writing. George Trail, in &quot;Teaching Argument and the Rhetoric of Orwell&#x27;s &#x27;Politics and the English Language&#x27;&quot;, says &quot;A large part of Orwell&#x27;s rhetorical approach consists of attempting at every opportunity to acquire reader participation, to involve the reader as an active and engaged consumer of the essay. Popular journalism is full of what may be the inheritance of Orwell&#x27;s reader involvement devices&quot;. Haltom and Ostrom&#x27;s work, &quot;Teaching George Orwell in Karl Rove&#x27;s World: &#x27;Politics and the English Language&#x27; in the 21st Century Classroom&quot;, discusses how following Orwell&#x27;s six rules of English writing and speaking can have a place in high school and university settings.

==Connection to other works==

Orwell&#x27;s preoccupation with language as a theme can be seen in his protagonist&#x27;s dislike of advertising slogans in &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, an early work. This preoccupation is also visible in &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, and continues as an underlying theme of Orwell&#x27;s work in the years after World War II.

The themes in &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; anticipate Orwell&#x27;s development of Newspeak in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Michael Shelden calls Newspeak &quot;the perfect language for a society of bad writers...because it reduces the number of choices available to them&quot;. Shelden says that Newspeak first corrupts writers morally, then politically, &quot;since it allows writers to cheat themselves and their readers with ready-made prose&quot;.

<doc id="218020" wikidata="Q27725" url="?curid=218020" title="Anatinae">
<text>The Anatinae are a subfamily of the family Anatidae (swans, geese and ducks). Its surviving members are the dabbling ducks, which feed mainly at the surface rather than by diving. The other members of the Anatinae are the extinct moa-nalo, a young but highly apomorphic lineage derived from the dabbling ducks.

There has been much debate about the systematical status and which ducks belong to the Anatinae. Some taxonomic authorities only include the dabbling ducks and their close relatives, the extinct moa-nalos. Alternatively, the Anatinae are considered to include most &quot;ducks&quot;, and the dabbling ducks form a tribe Anatini within these. The classification as presented here more appropriately reflects the remaining uncertainty about the interrelationships of the major lineages of Anatidae (waterfowl).

==Systematics==
The dabbling duck group, of worldwide distribution, was delimited in a 1986 study to include eight genera and some 50–60 living species. However, Salvadori&#x27;s teal is almost certainly closely related to the pink-eared duck, and other genera are likewise of unresolved affiliation. The peculiar marbled duck, formerly tentatively assigned to the dabbling ducks, is thought to be a diving duck or even a distinct subfamily.

This group of ducks has been so named because its members feed mainly on vegetable matter by upending on the water surface, or grazing, and only rarely diving. These are mostly gregarious ducks of freshwater or estuaries. These birds are strong fliers and northern species are highly migratory. Compared to other types of duck, their legs are located more towards the centre of their bodies. They walk well on land, and some species feed terrestrially.

&quot;Puddle ducks&quot; generally feed on the surface of the water or feed on very shallow bottoms. They are not equipped to dive down several feet like their diving counterparts. The most prominent difference between puddle ducks and divers is the size of the feet. A puddle duck&#x27;s feet are generally smaller because they do not need the extra propulsion to dive for their forage.

Another distinguishing characteristic of puddle ducks when compared with diving ducks is the way in which they take flight when spooked or are on the move. Puddle ducks spring straight up from the water, but diving ducks need to gain momentum to take off, so they must run across the water a short distance to gain flight.

Traditionally, most ducks were assigned to either the shelducks, the perching ducks, and the dabbling and diving ducks; the latter two were presumed to make up the Anatinae. However, the perching ducks turned out to be a paraphyletic assemblage of various tropical waterfowl that happened to evolve the ability to perch well in their forested habitat. Several of these, such as the Brazilian teal, were subsequently assigned to the Anatinae.

As for the diving ducks, mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data indicates that they are fairly distant from the dabbling ducks. The morphological similarities are due to convergent evolution.

In addition, the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, as traditionally defined, is not monophyletic; several South American species belong to a distinct clade which would include the &quot;Tachyeres&quot; steamer-ducks. Other species, such as the Baikal teal, should also be considered distinct.

==Genera==
The following genera are (with one exception) unequivocal dabbling ducks:
* &quot;Amazonetta&quot; – status not fully resolved, most likely a dabbling duck
* &quot;Sibirionetta&quot; – Baikal teal
* &quot;Spatula&quot;
* &quot;Mareca&quot;
* &quot;Lophonetta&quot; – crested duck
* &quot;Speculanas&quot; – bronze-winged duck
* &quot;Anas&quot;

The three known genera and four known species of moa-nalos all became extinct around AD 1000. They formerly occurred on the Hawaiian Islands and were derived from dabbling ducks, possibly even from a close ancestor of the mallard:
* &quot;Chelychelynechen&quot;
* &quot;Thambetochen&quot;
* &quot;Ptaiochen&quot;

Subfossil remains of a small, flightless dabbling duck have been recovered on Rota in the Mariana Islands. These cannot be assigned to a known genus, but probably are closest to &quot;Anas&quot;. A most bizarre duck-like bird, &quot;Talpanas lippa&quot; has been found on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Because of its unique apomorphies (it seems to have had small eyes high and far back on its head), the placement of this anatid is likewise unresolved; only dabbling ducks and true geese are with certainty known to have colonized the Hawaiian archipelago.

Another bizarre insular anatine was &quot;Bambolinetta&quot; from the Late Miocene of Tuscana, then part of the Tuscano-Sardinian insular landmass. Flightless or at least a poor flyer, it instead shows adaptations for wing-propelled diving, occupying a similar ecological niche to that of penguins and plotopterids.

Frequently placed into the Anatinae are these genera, whose relationships must be considered uncertain at present:
* †&quot;Chenoanas&quot;?
* †&quot;Dunstanetta&quot; (Johnstone&#x27;s duck)
* †&quot;Lavadytis&quot;
* †&quot;Pinpanetta&quot;
* †&quot;Tirarinetta&quot;
* &quot;Oxyurini&quot; (stiff-tailed ducks)
** &quot;Heteronetta&quot; (black-headed duck)
** &quot;Nomonyx&quot; (masked duck)
** &quot;Oxyura&quot;
* &quot;Biziura&quot; – Oxyurini?
* &quot;Aix&quot; – Tadorninae?
* &quot;Cairina&quot; – may be paraphyletic, with one species in Tadorninae and the other closer to diving ducks
* &quot;Callonetta&quot; – Tadorninae?
* &quot;Chenonetta&quot; – Tadorninae?
* &quot;Pteronetta&quot; – may belong into a distinct clade with &quot;Cyanochen&quot;
* &quot;Nettapus&quot; – part of ancient Gondwanan lineage?
* &quot;Mergini&quot; - (seaducks)
** †&quot;Chendytes&quot;
** †&quot;Shiriyanetta&quot;
** &quot;Polysticta&quot;
** &quot;Somateria&quot;
** &quot;Histrionicus&quot;
** †&quot;Camptorhynchus&quot;
** &quot;Melanitta&quot;
** &quot;Clangula&quot;
** &quot;Bucephala&quot;
** &quot;Mergellus&quot;?
** &quot;Lophodytes&quot;?
** &quot;Mergus&quot;?

On the other hand, the following genera, usually considered to belong into the Tadorninae, may actually be dabbling ducks:
* &quot;Sarkidiornis&quot;
* &quot;Tachyeres&quot;

<text>Wired is the third solo album by the British guitarist Jeff Beck, released on Epic Records in 1976. An instrumental album, it peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Background and content==
Of the album tracks, four are originals by Narada Michael Walden and one by Jan Hammer. According to popular belief Max Middleton contributed the homage to Led Zeppelin, &quot;Led Boots&quot;, however the keyboardist said it had nothing to do with Led Zeppelin. Jeff Beck chose to interpret the Charles Mingus ode to saxophonist Lester Young, &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot;, from the classic 1959 jazz album &quot;Mingus Ah Um&quot;. These last two tracks were long-time staples of Beck&#x27;s performance repertoire.

==Reception==

&quot;Wired&quot; received mostly positive reviews when it was released. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the reviewer cited it as being full of &quot;fire and imagination&quot;. However, Robert Christgau faulted it as technically proficient but soulless, calling it &quot;mindless trickery&quot;. Engineer Peter Henderson later said of the album, &quot;I listened to that a few years later and it sounded like it had been recorded direct to cassette. I don&#x27;t think it was one of my finer moments.&quot;

Writing for AllMusic, Mark Kirschenmann said, &quot;Within a two-year span, the twin towers &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot; set a standard for instrumental rock that even Beck has found difficult to match. On &quot;Wired&quot;, with first-rate material and collaborators on hand, one of rock&#x27;s most compelling guitarists is in top form.&quot;

The album peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in August 1976, spending a total of 25 weeks on the chart. In the UK it spent five weeks on the chart and reached No. 35. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Release history==
In addition to the conventional two channel stereo version, the album was also released by Epic in 1976 in a four channel quadraphonic edition on LP record and 8-track tape. The quad LP release was encoded in the SQ matrix system.

The album was first released on CD in 1985 in Japan. In 2001, a remastered stereo edition of the CD was reissued internationally. 

The album was reissued in stereo in the United States on the hybrid Super Audio CD format in 2016 by Analogue Productions. The same year it was also reissued by Epic in Japan as a hybrid multichannel SACD. The Japanese SACD version has the entire stereo album, but also adds the complete quad album on the same disc adapted for 5.1 surround sound. This marks the first time that the quad version has been reissued in a digital format.

<text>Blow by Blow is Jeff Beck&#x27;s first album credited to him as a solo artist. It was recorded in October 1974 and released via Epic Records in 1975. An instrumental album, it peaked at No. 4 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Background and content==
After the dissolution of the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice (BBA) in spring 1974, Beck took time for session work with other groups. In December, a half-hearted &quot;audition&quot; for The Rolling Stones took place, Beck jamming blues with the band for one day, before realising their musical styles were not compatible.

During this period, Beck decided to record an all-instrumental album, bringing back keyboardist Max Middleton from the second Jeff Beck Group. He hired George Martin to produce after hearing his work with the Mahavishnu Orchestra&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. According to Carmine Appice, who played with Beck in BBA, he was involved in the writing and recording process of &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; but Appice&#x27;s parts were edited out after a dispute with Beck&#x27;s management. The fourth key contributor to &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; after Beck, Middleton, and Martin was Stevie Wonder, who gave Beck his songs &quot;Cause We&#x27;ve Ended as Lovers&quot; and &quot;Thelonius&quot;, with Wonder playing clavinet on the latter uncredited. The former song appeared on Wonder&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta&quot;, made with then-wife Syreeta Wright, while Wonder never recorded &quot;Thelonius&quot; himself. A cover of the Beatles song &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot; was selected, as well as the composition &quot;Diamond Dust&quot; by Bernie Holland of the group Hummingbird consisting of musicians from the second Beck Group. The other five tracks were band originals with Beck and Middleton the main writers, and the last track on each side featured string arrangements by Martin. Beck dedicated &quot;Cause We&#x27;ve Ended as Lovers&quot; to fellow guitarist Roy Buchanan, with an acknowledgement to Wonder.

==Release==
&quot;Blow by Blow&quot; was released in March 1975. It was a hit in the US, reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, eventually selling a million copies. It remains Beck&#x27;s highest-charting album.

On 27 March 2001, a remastered edition for compact disc was reissued by Legacy Records, Epic and its parent label Columbia Records now a division of Sony Music Entertainment.

A live version of the track &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot;.

<text>XCOM (originally called &quot;X-COM&quot;) is a science fiction video game franchise featuring an elite international organization tasked with countering alien invasions of Earth. The series began with the strategy video game &quot;&quot; created by Julian Gollop&#x27;s Mythos Games and MicroProse in 1994. The original lineup by MicroProse included six published and at least two canceled games, as well as two novels. The &quot;X-COM&quot; series, in particular its original entry, achieved a sizable cult following and has influenced many other video games; including the creation of a number of clones, spiritual successors, and unofficial remakes.

A reboot series was published by 2K Games, beginning with the strategy video game &quot;&quot;, developed by Firaxis Games and released in 2012 to critical and commercial success. It was followed by the prequel &quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&quot; and the sequels &quot;XCOM 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

== Games ==
=== Released ===
 &quot;X-COM&quot; series (1994–2001) &quot;XCOM&quot; reboot series (2012–present)
=== Cancelled ===
=== Original &quot;X-COM&quot; series (1994–2001) ===


The &quot;X-COM&quot; core series consisted of four main games published by MicroProse: &quot;&quot; (also known as &quot;X-COM: UFO Defense&quot;, PC and Amiga in 1994, Sony PlayStation in 1995), &quot;X-COM: Terror from the Deep&quot; (PC in 1995, PlayStation in 1996), &quot;X-COM: Apocalypse&quot; (PC in 1997) and &quot;X-COM: Interceptor&quot; (PC in 1998). The premise of the franchise is that an alien invasion beginning in 1999 prompts the creation of a clandestine paramilitary organization codenamed X-COM (an abbreviation of &quot;Extraterrestrial Combat&quot;) by a coalition of funding nations. The player is charged with leading this force and tasked to secretly engage and research the alien threat. The sequels, against new alien invasions, are set underwater (&quot;Terror from the Deep&quot;, set in 2040), in a futuristic megacity (&quot;Apocalypse&quot;, set in 2084), and in space (&quot;Interceptor&quot;, set in 2067 and making it a prequel to &quot;Apocalypse&quot;).

&quot;UFO: Enemy Unknown&quot;, featuring a turn-based ground combat system, remains the most popular and successful game in the series, having been often featured on various lists of best video games of all time. The first sequel, &quot;Terror from the Deep&quot;, was quickly created by MicroProse&#x27;s internal team; based on the same game engine and used largely identical gameplay mechanics. &quot;Apocalypse&quot; took several new directions with the series, introducing an optional real-time combat system and shifting the aesthetics to a retro-futuristic style. A spin-off game, &quot;Interceptor&quot;, constitutes a hybrid of a strategy game and a space combat flight simulator.

After &quot;Interceptor&quot;, Hasbro Interactive purchased MicroProse, acquiring its studios and the &quot;X-COM&quot; brand. There were talks of &quot;X-COM&quot; toys, comics, and even a cartoon show. A budget range, turn-based tactical play-by-mail multiplayer game &quot;Em@il Games: X-COM&quot; was released in 1999. In 2001, Hasbro published &quot;X-COM: Enforcer&quot;, a poorly received third-person shooter loosely based on the events of &quot;Enemy Unknown&quot;, marking a low point in the series. The &quot;X-COM&quot; games were also released as part of four compilation releases: &quot;X-COM (Collector&#x27;s Edition)&quot; (1998), &quot;X-COM Collection&quot; (1999) and &quot;X-COM: Complete Pack&quot; (2008), as well as in &quot;2K Huge Games Pack&quot; in 2009.

At least two more major titles have been planned for this series. One of them was &quot;X-COM: Genesis&quot;, a real-time strategy and tactics game &quot;going back to the roots but in full 3D.&quot; Another was &quot;X-COM: Alliance&quot; (also known as &quot;X-COM 4&quot; and the project &quot;Fox Force Five&quot;), an &quot;Aliens&quot;-inspired mix of strategy game and first-person perspective tactical shooter, using the licensed original Unreal Engine. However, both of these projects were cancelled after ex-MicroProse Hasbro Interactive studios were all shut down in 1999–2000 (with &quot;Alliance&quot; being later abortively reactivated in 2001-2002 before being quietly cancelled again without any official announcement). Terry Greer, a former senior artist and head of game design at MicroProse UK, disclosed: &quot;We&#x27;d also discussed other avenues for future games including time travel, retaking the solar system (with interplanetary distances playing a significant role in recruitment and resources), and resistance movement concept where you had to fight back after the world was taken and humanity was totally under the alien yoke.&quot;

&quot;OpenXcom&quot; is an open source re-implementation of the first game in the series intended to fix all the bugs and enable modding. &quot;OpenApoc&quot; is a similar open source project for &quot;X-COM: Apocalypse&quot;.

=== &quot;XCOM&quot; series (2012–present) ===

In 2010, 2K Marin announced they were working on re-imagining of &quot;X-COM&quot;, relabeled as &quot;XCOM&quot;. It was described as a tactical and strategic first-person shooter that would combine elements from the original &quot;X-COM&quot; alongside a new setting and viewpoint while keeping some main concepts from the original game series. The setting received a complete overhaul, now based in the early 1960s, with the original XCOM organization being a secret U.S. federal agency. Originally planned for 2011, the game was repeatedly redesigned by different studios before being finally released in 2013 as &quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&quot; for Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

In 2012, Firaxis Games (led by MicroProse co-founder Sid Meier) announced the development of a Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 strategy game &quot;&quot;, a &quot;re-imagination&quot; of &quot;UFO: Enemy Unknown&quot; with real-time strategic view, turn-based combat and destructible tactical environments more in the vein of the original &quot;X-COM&quot; game and set in a more contemporary setting than the &quot;XCOM&quot; game by 2K Marin. &quot;XCOM: Enemy Unknown&quot; was released later that same year to critical acclaim, winning multiple &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards. &quot;X-COM&quot; creator Julian Gollop hailed it as &quot;a phoenix rising from the ashes of the &quot;X-COM&quot; disaster,&quot; saying that &quot;it’s amazing that after 20 years, a brand that had gone so badly in the wrong direction has finally been put right.&quot; It was also ported to Android, iOS, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation Vita.

In 2013, Firaxis released a downloadable content for the base game &quot;XCOM: Enemy Unknown&quot; titled &quot;&quot;. It was made available on Steam (which requires &quot;Enemy Unknown&quot; to play), as well as for iOS, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (those versions are standalone and do not require &quot;Enemy Unknown&quot;).

In 2015, Firaxis announced a sequel, &quot;XCOM 2&quot;. It was released in 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, and Linux (Later ported to several other platforms, including the Nintendo Switch, but not iOS). Its expansion, &quot;XCOM 2: War of the Chosen&quot;, followed in 2017. The next game in the series, &quot;&quot;, was released in April 2020, for Windows. Unlike the global scale of previous games, &quot;Chimera Squad&quot; focused on a specific city, giving the player control of a diverse squad of humans and aliens. The game introduced several changes to game mechanics, such as replacing randomly generated and customizable squad members with preset and unique soldiers, and utilizing &quot;interleaved turns&quot; (mixing turn order between the opposing teams during combat) instead of a team-by-team turn system.

===Julian Gollop&#x27;s unofficial games===
&quot;The Dreamland Chronicles: Freedom Ridge&quot; was a game for the PC and PlayStation 2 by Julian Gollop&#x27;s Mythos Games (creators of &quot;UFO: Enemy Unknown&quot; and &quot;X-COM: Apocalypse&quot;), claimed to having been &quot;essentially a remake of the first &quot;X-Com&quot; with 3D graphics.&quot; &quot;The Dreamland Chronicles&quot; was canceled in 2001 and Mythos Games soon ceased to exist.

&quot;Laser Squad Nemesis&quot; is a 2002 low-budget PC turn-based tactics game developed by Gollop&#x27;s next company Codo Technologies and very similar to the turn-based Battlescape combat system of the first &quot;X-COM&quot;. In 2005, Codo Technologies and publisher Namco also released &quot;&quot;, a Game Boy Advance turn-based tactical role-playing game that too was reminiscent of the early Battlescape system.

&quot;Phoenix Point&quot; is a strategy and turn-based tactics video game for Windows, and OS X that has the open world, strategic layers of the &quot;X-COM&quot; style games of the 1990s like &quot;Enemy Unknown&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse&quot; together with the presentation and tactical mechanics of the more recent Firaxis reboot games. The game was developed by Gollop with Snapshot Games, an independent game studio in Bulgaria. &quot;Phoenix Point&quot;, described as a spiritual successor to &quot;X-COM&quot;, was released in December 2019.

== Other media ==
=== Literature ===
Two &quot;X-COM&quot; novels have been published based on the first game in the series: Diane Duane&#x27;s &quot;X-COM: UFO Defense - A Novel&quot; (1995, ) and Vladimir Vasilyev&#x27;s &quot;Enemy Unknown&quot; (1997). The reboot series&#x27; novel is titled &quot;XCOM 2: Resurrection&quot; by Greg Keyes and was published in 2015, bridging the plots of &quot;XCOM&quot; and its sequel. In 2017, a second novel was published with the title &quot;XCOM 2: Escalation&quot; by Rick Barba.

MicroProse&#x27;s manual/documentation writer John Possidente also wrote three short stories, &quot;Decommissioning&quot;, &quot;Manley&#x27;s Deposition&quot;, and &quot;Moray in the Wreck&quot;, taking place between the events of the first two games in the series. More recently, &quot;X-COM&quot; co-designer Dave Ellis and artist Jon McCoy released a free online tribute digital comic titled &quot;Deep Rising&quot;, with music created by &quot;X-COM&quot; composer John Broomhall.

=== Board game ===
A board game entitled &quot;&quot;, designed by Eric M. Lang and based on the 2012 reboot, was released on January 28, 2015, by Fantasy Flight Games.

== Intellectual property rights ==
The trademark for the &quot;X-COM&quot; name was filed on May 25, 1995, by MicroProse Software. According to Julian Gollop, &quot;They wanted us to do a deal where we would sign over any rights that we might have in return for some cash plus a high royalty on &quot;X-COM: Apocalypse&quot;. They more or less insisted on it, otherwise they were threatening to cancel the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; project, so there was a lot of bluff involved.&quot; Following the acquisition and subsequent merger of MicroProse with Hasbro, the X-COM intellectual property (IP) was also transferred to Hasbro Interactive on August 19, 1998. Due to financial difficulties, Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames Entertainment SA on January 29, 2001. As part of this transfer, the &quot;X-COM&quot; IP was legally transferred to Infogrames on December 21, 2001 (shortly thereafter, Infogrames was renamed Atari SA). In 2005, Atari SA transferred several IPs to Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and &quot;X-COM&quot; was transferred with them on June 12, 2005.

The X-COM IP is currently owned by Take-Two and its subsidiaries; by 2007, first rumors emerged that Irrational Games (who are owned by Take-Two) were developing a new&quot; X-COM&quot; title (this game eventually became &quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&quot;). In May 2007, 2K Games (a subsidiary of Take-Two) inherited the &quot;X-COM&quot; franchise and re-released &quot;Terror from the Deep&quot; on Steam. In September 2008, &quot;UFO: Enemy Unknown&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Interceptor&quot; and &quot;Enforcer&quot; were also re-released as downloadable titles. 2K Games&#x27; &quot;XCOM&quot;, which had been in development since 2003 (prior to the IP acquisition), was finally completed and released in 2012.

== Inspired titles == 
Because of the series&#x27; popularity, various other developers have created spiritual successor games similar in theme and tone of the &quot;X-COM&quot; games (sometimes called &quot;&quot;X-COM&quot; clones&quot;; Julian Gollop also himself called turn-based tactical game genre in general as &quot;sons of &quot;Rebelstar&quot; in a reference to one of his earlier games). The level to which they borrow from the original series varies.

<text>is a Tokyo municipal official. With her election in April 2003, she became the first openly transgender person to seek or win elected office in Japan.

==Life==

Aya Kamikawa was born on January 25, 1968, in Tokyo&#x27;s Taitō Ward. She is the second child of three. She attended Hosei University Second Senior High School, an all-boys school.

In 1990, Kamikawa graduated from Hosei University with a degree in Business Administration. She began to work in the field of public relations whilst presenting masculine. In 1995, she resigned from her post, citing stress associated with gender dysphoria, and began hormone replacement therapy. In 1998, she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder by a psychiatrist. In 1999, she started working at a private company whilst presenting feminine. She also changed her name to Aya that same year.

In 2003, Kamikawa, then a 35-year-old writer, submitted her election application papers with a blank space for &quot;sex&quot;. She won a four-year term as an independent under huge media attention, placing sixth of 72 candidates running for 52 seats in the Setagaya ward assembly, the most populous district in Tokyo. Despite the government counting her win as part of the number of men elected to public office, she stated that she would work as a woman. Her platform was to improve rights for women, children, the elderly, the handicapped, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

In 2005, subsequent to the passage of Japan&#x27;s GID law, Kamikawa was finally able to change the sex designator on her koseki to female.

Kamikawa was the only openly transgender official in Japan until the 2017 election of Tomoya Hosoda.

<text>To Mega Therion is the second studio album by Swiss extreme metal band Celtic Frost, released in October 1985 through Noise Records. The cover artwork is a painting by H. R. Giger titled &quot;Satan I&quot;.

&quot;To Mega Therion&quot; translates to &quot;the great beast&quot; in Greek. It is an expression found in the Bible but was also a nickname used by Aleister Crowley

==Reception==

Ned Raggett in his review for AllMusic wrote, &quot;The bombastic &#x27;Innocence and Wrath&#x27; starts &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; off on just the appropriate note – Wagnerian horn lines, booming drums, and a slow crunch toward apocalypse. ... With that setting the tone, it is into the maddeningly wild and woolly Celtic Frost universe full bore, Warrior roaring out his vocals with glee and a wicked smile while never resorting to self-parodic castrato wails. &#x27;The Usurper&#x27; alone is worth the price of admission, an awesome display of Warrior&#x27;s knack around brute power and unexpectedly memorable riffs.&quot; According to Raggett, &quot;other prime cuts&quot; include &quot;Circle of the Tyrants&quot;, &quot;Dawn of Megiddo&quot;, &quot;Tears in a Prophet&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Eternal Summer&quot; and &quot;Necromantical Screams&quot;. Raggett concludes his review by stating that the album &quot;is and remains death metal at its finest&quot;.

==Legacy==
The album was a major influence on the then-developing death metal and black metal genres.

Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considers the album &quot;a black metal landmark&quot; and &quot;the most consistent example of early death metal that exists&quot;. He remarks how &quot;the band had decided to delve more into the extreme&quot; and praised Tom Warrior&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly accomplished&quot; lyrics and the mix of death, black and doom metal with a pinch of ambient music.

&quot;Decibel&quot; magazine ranked &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; #21 in their &quot;Decibel Thrash Top 50&quot; list. Writer Nick Green praises both its &quot;purer&quot; thrash metal tracks such as &quot;Circle of the Tyrants&quot; and the experimental edge of &quot;Necromantical Screams.&quot;

<doc id="218044" wikidata="Q1419910" url="?curid=218044" title="Ireland's Call">
<text>&quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; is a song by Phil Coulter used as a anthem by some sports competitors representing the island of Ireland, originally and most notably the men&#x27;s rugby union team. It was commissioned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) for the 1995 World Cup, because a substantial minority, around 20%, of the IRFU&#x27;s members are from Northern Ireland and the use of the anthem of the Republic of Ireland (&quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot;) was considered inappropriate. 

While some all-island sports governing bodies use &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; in international competition (for example, the Golfing Union of Ireland and Irish Athletic Boxing Association) others do not, and many have followed the IRFU in adopting &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;, including Hockey Ireland, the Irish Cricket Union, Rugby League Ireland, Irish Korfball Association, and A1 Grand Prix team. The song has attracted some opposition, both on musical grounds and from Irish nationalists who would prefer &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot;. Journalist Malachy Clerkin wrote on its 20th anniversary, &quot;It has run the gamut with a sceptical and often hostile public, from deep loathing to grudging acceptance to growing pockets of reasonably throated support.&quot;

==Rugby history==
From the Partition of Ireland until the 1930s, no flag or anthem was used at IRFU internationals. After objections from clubs in the then Irish Free State, a compromise was agreed to use an IRFU flag, with &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; at matches in the Free State, &quot;God Save the King&quot; at those in Northern Ireland, and no anthem at away matches. Ulster unionist players are not expected to sing &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot;. There were no senior internationals in Northern Ireland from 1954 to 2007. Des Fitzgerald declined to play a 1982 B international in Belfast as &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; would be played. Before a 1954 Five Nations match in Ravenhill, Belfast, players from the Republic refused to take the field until after &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; had finished. Cahir Healy negotiated a compromise whereby the Royal Salute was played instead of the full anthem, and promised that future internationals would be played in Dublin. The incident was hushed up. Playing all matches at Lansdowne Road suited the IRFU in any case, since gate receipts would be larger than at Ravenhill.

Unionist opposition to &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; was strengthened on 25 April 1987, when an IRA roadside bomb killed judge Maurice Gibson and his wife, and also damaged a car carrying three of the senior squad from Belfast to Dublin for training. David Irwin and Philip Rainey recovered but Nigel Carr&#x27;s rugby career was ended by his injuries. The next month, at the inaugural Rugby World Cup, captain Donal Lenihan objected that all other teams would have an anthem. At the last minute before the side&#x27;s opening match in Athletic Park, Wellington, a James Last cassette recording of &quot;The Rose of Tralee&quot; was borrowed from Phil Orr; the music and poor recording quality attracted much criticism and no anthem was played for later matches. At the 1991 World Cup, there was no anthem away to Scotland, Ireland&#x27;s only game outside Dublin.

For the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, the IRFU decided to commission a song from Phil Coulter. His composition, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;, has since been played alongside &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; at matches within the Republic, and on its own elsewhere. Ireland&#x27;s match against England at Croke Park in the 2007 Six Nations Championship was of historic significance because of the Rule 42 ban and the memory of Bloody Sunday 1920; &quot;The Irish Times&quot; commented, &#x27;&quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; were belted out with such hair-raising intensity that men and women were crying as they sang&#x27;. Prior to the 2007 resumption of internationals at Ravenhill Stadium, Belfast, the IRFU decided that only &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; would be played, not &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, prompting complaints from some unionists that this did not match the playing of &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; in Dublin.

==Other sports==
Other all-island teams have adopted &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; for similar reasons to the IRFU&#x27;s. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams, having previously used the &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, adopted &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; in 2000, including for Olympic qualification matches, but the Olympic Council of Ireland standard &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; was used at Rio 2016, its first post-independence appearance at the Olympics. At the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, the Ireland team had &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; at a match in England, but no anthem at a match in Belfast. In the years before 2008 it &quot;used neutral symbols and anthems such as &#x27;Ireland&#x27;s Call&#x27;&quot;. Rugby League Ireland adopted &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; for the 2008 World Cup, explaining &quot;&#x27;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&#x27; has always been played at amateur level and it was a unanimous decision to extend this policy to the professional game.&quot; By the 2017 World Cup it had reverted to &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;. The Irish Waterski and Wakeboard Federation adopted &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; on a one-off basis for the 2016 EA Wakeboard Championships, because they were in Coleraine in &quot;very close proximity to a Loyalist Estate&quot;. The National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland&#x27;s policy document states that it &#x27;is a 32 county body and as such the anthem will be &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot; except in circumstances where this may cause discomfort or embarrassment. On such occasions the only permitted deviation allowed is &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot;.&#x27; In 2018, The Irish Butchers Team that won the World Butchers&#x27; Challenge in Belfast used Ireland&#x27;s Call as their anthem. The 2022 team to compete in Sacramento, California will also use Ireland&#x27;s Call as their anthem.

==Song==
The song was written by Phil Coulter in 1995. He said he composed it because he loved hearing a combination of Irish accents singing together. It was first broadcast simultaneously on the &quot;Kelly&quot; show in Northern Ireland and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in the Republic, sung by Andrew Strong accompanied by the Portadown Male Voice Choir.

At most games today, only the first verse is sung, followed by the chorus in the same key. The chorus is then repeated in a higher key; at the end, the last line is repeated. Several Irish-language translations have been made for Gaelscoil pupils, with the title .

Coulter subsequently rewrote the lyrics to be sung in the Celtic Thunder singing tour, when he collaborated with Sharon Browne, the original producer of Celtic Woman. The rewritten lyrics have a somewhat more martial theme, with lines like &quot;meet our destiny with glory&quot; and &quot;Till our final requiem is spoken&quot;.
