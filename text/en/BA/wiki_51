<text>José Francisco Morazán Quesada (; born October 3, 1792 – September 15, 1842) was a liberal Central American politician and general who served as president of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1830 to 1839. Before he was president of Central America he was the head of state of Honduras. He rose to prominence at the Battle of La Trinidad on November 11, 1827. Morazán then dominated the political and military scene of Central America until his execution in 1842.

In the political arena, Francisco Morazán was recognized as a visionary and great thinker, as he attempted to transform Central America into one large and progressive nation. He enacted liberal reforms in the new Federal Republic of Central America, including freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Morazán also limited church power by making marriage secular and abolishing government-aided tithing.

These reforms made him some powerful enemies, and his period of rule was marked by bitter infighting between liberals and conservatives. But through his military skills, Morazán was able to keep a firm grip on power until 1837, when the Federal Republic became irrevocably fractured. This was exploited by the conservative leaders, who rallied around the leadership of Rafael Carrera and in order to protect their own interests, ended up dividing Central America into five nations.

==Personal life==

=== Early years and education ===
José Francisco Morazán Quesada was born on October 3, 1792, in Tegucigalpa (then in the Captaincy General of Guatemala, now the capital of Honduras) during the waning years of Spanish colonial rule to Eusebio Morazán Alemán and Guadalupe Quesada Borjas, both members of an upper-class Creole family dedicated to trade and agriculture. His grandparents were Juan Bautista Morazán (a Corsican immigrant) and María Borjas Alvarenga. Thirteen days after his birth Morazán was baptized at San Miguel Arcángel church, by father Juan Francisco Márquez.

Francisco Morazán was, for the most part, a self-educated man. According to historian Ramon Rosa; he &quot;had the misfortune of being born ... in that sad era of isolation and total darkness in which Honduras lacked schools ... therefore Morazan had to learn in private schools with an awful organization and sustained by parents&#x27; contributions.&quot; In 1804, his parents took advantage of the opening of a Catholic school in the village of San Francisco. At the age of twelve, José Francisco was sent there to learn to write and read, and to receive instruction in mathematics and drawing. The teachings he received were through Friar Santiago Gabrielino, appointed religious instructor to the Guatemalan priest José Antonio Murga.

In 1808 Francisco Morazán and his family moved to Morocelí where they worked the fields inherited by Mr Eusebio. In addition, young José Francisco also engaged in helping the town&#x27;s mayor with his clerk duties. In 1813 the family moved back to Tegucigalpa. Once there, Mr. Eusebio placed his son under the tutorship of Leon Vasquez who taught him civil law, criminal procedure and Notaries.

Francisco now had access to a library where he learned French, which in turn, allowed him to familiarize himself with the works of Montesquieu, the social contract of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the French Revolution, the history of Europe, as well as the biographies of the Greek and Roman leaders. This dedication and spirit of improvement took Francisco to occasionally excel in his hometown, where he even represented the interest of some people before the colonial courts.

===Marriage and family===
Francisco Morazán married María Josefa Lastiri in the Cathedral of Comayagua on December 30, 1825. They had one daughter, Adela Morazán Lastiri, born in San Salvador in 1838. Lastiri belonged to one of the wealthiest families in province of Honduras. Her father was the Spanish trader Juan Miguel Lastiri, who played an important part in the commercial development of Tegucigalpa. Her mother was Margarita Lozano, member of a powerful Creole family in the city.

María Josefa was a widow who had first married the landowner Esteban Travieso, with whom she had 4 children. Upon his death, she inherited a fortune. Her fortune and the new circle of powerful and influential friends, that came out of this marriage only enhanced Morazán&#x27;s own business, and thus his political and military projects.

Outside his marriage, Francisco Morazán fathered a son, Francisco Morazán Moncada, who was born on October 4, 1827, to Francisca Moncada, daughter of a well-known Nicaraguan politician named Liberato Moncada. Francisco Morazán Junior lived in the Morazán-Lastiri home and accompanied his father in Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Peru and finally in Costa Rica, where his father was executed. After the death of his father, Francisco Morazán Moncada settled in Chinandega, Nicaragua where he devoted himself to farming. He died in 1904 at age 77.

Morazán also had an adoptive son named José Antonio Ruiz. He was the legitimate son of Eusebio Ruiz and the Guatemalan lady Rita Zelayandía, who handed her son to General Morazán when he was 14 years old. José Antonio accompanied his adoptive father on military actions and became a brigadier general. He died in Tegucigalpa in 1883.

===Early political and military career===
After the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which included Honduras, became independent from Spain (on September 15, 1821) Francisco Morazán began to take an active part in politics and public administration. He worked at Tegucigalpa&#x27;s City Hall as deputy mayor and public defender in civil and criminal court cases. Such activities allowed him to acquire a great knowledge of the structure and operation of the public administration of the province. This job also allowed him to get in close contact with the problems of post-colonial society.

In November 1821, shortly after the Captaincy had declared its independence from Spain, a group of dignitaries and politicians known as the &#x27;Interim Advisory Board&#x27; sat in Guatemala City in the process of organizing a government to succeed Spanish colonial rule. On November 18, a note from General Agustín de Iturbide arrived in Guatemala City suggesting a union between the Captaincy and the Mexican Empire, pursuant to the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba. The members of the Interim Advisory Board, after reviewing the issue, stated they were not empowered nor deputized to decide on this matter, but suggested forums be held in different cities to hear the views of the people, and thus explore their willingness to go forward with the proposal. The question of annexation to Mexico caused divisions within each of the provinces as some cities were in favor and others against. In Honduras, Comayagua, through its Governor José Tinoco de Contreras, supported the idea of the annexation. But Tegucigalpa, the second most important city of the province, strongly opposed it. Tinoco then decided to take repressive actions against the authorities of that city.

In order to offset Tinoco&#x27;s aggressiveness and to defend their independence, an army of volunteers organized in Tegucigalpa. It was during these events, that Francisco Morazán enlisted as a volunteer at the service of the authorities in Tegucigalpa. He was appointed captain of one of the companies, by decision of the organizers of the militias. Thus began Morazán&#x27;s military life and his struggle against conservative interests.

Tegucigalpa could not maintain its opposition, however, and recognized its annexation to Mexico on August 22, 1822. The annexation to the Mexican Empire was short-lived, with the collapse of the Mexican Empire and the subsequent creation of the Federal Republic of Central America on April 1, 1823. That same year, the Constituent Congress in Guatemala appointed Morazán as a member of a commission to study the affairs of the Federation. That same commission determined the electoral districts, district boards and the departmental boards of the Federal Republic. A year later Morazán&#x27;s uncle Dionisio de Herrera, was elected Head of State in Honduras. On September 28, 1824, he appointed Morazán as his secretary general.

==Background of the Federal Republic==
The Central American Federation (1824–1838) comprised the republics of Central America—Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. United under a captaincy general in Spanish colonial times, they gained independence in 1821 and were briefly annexed to the Mexican Empire formed by Agustín de Iturbide in 1822. On July 1, 1823, these nations regained their independence, and joined together in a loose federal state.

In the following year, the Constituent Congress of Central America met in Guatemala City, to decide which system of government to adopt for the young nation. In debates two different proposals emerged. The Liberal Party wanted a federalist government, similar to that of the United States of 1789. This type of government would provide every state significant autonomy of self-administration, freedom to create its own laws and reforms, among other things, but always under the supervision of the federal government, keeper of the constitution.

The Conservatives on the other hand, wanted a centralist government. In this system, the decisions and laws adopted by the central government would apply equally to all the other states. After debating the proposals, the Liberal majority prevailed, and the federalist system was adopted. On November 22, 1824, under the motto: &quot;God, Union, Liberty&quot;, the new constitution was approved, and the nation was renamed the Federal Republic of Central America, appointing Manuel José Arce (1825–1829) as the first president.

== Rise to power ==

===Battle of &#x27;La Trinidad&#x27;===
In 1826, the Federal Government headed by Manuel José Arce attempted to dissolve the federal congress and called a meeting to be held in Cojutepeque, on October 10, 1826, to elect an extraordinary congress. This unconstitutional move was rejected by the Honduran head of state, Dionisio de Herrera. But President Arce did not recognize Herrera&#x27;s authority, claiming that Herrera&#x27;s provisional mandate had expired, and that he was in power illegitimately. For this reason, the National Assembly had called for new elections in Honduras, but Herrera had ignored this decree and remained in power. For these reasons, but under the guise of protecting Copán&#x27;s tobacco plantations owned by the federal government, Arce decided to oust Herrera. This mission was entrusted to colonel Justo Milla, who on April 9, 1827, commanded 200 men and seized Comayagua (the state capital) capturing Herrera and sending him to a Guatemalan prison.

While Milla was busy consolidating power in Comayagua, Morazán escaped from the federal troops. He left the besieged capital in the company of colonels Remigio Díaz and José Antonio Márquez, with the purpose of getting reinforcements in Tegucigalpa. Their plan was to return, and to liberate the state capital. Upon their return from Tegucigalpa, his men clashed with Milla&#x27;s forces on the ranch &#x27;La Maradiaga&#x27;. This confrontation, had no major consequences for either side; Milla remained in charge of Honduras, and Morazán left for Ojojona where he was captured and transferred to Tegucigalpa by order of Major Ramón Anguiano.

But Francisco Morazán managed to escape from his captors and left for La Unión, El Salvador, with the intention of emigrating to Mexico. In La Unión, he met Mariano Vidaurre, a special Salvadoran envoy to the government of Nicaragua. Vidaurre convinced him that, in that country, he could find the military support he needed to expel Milla from Honduran territory. He arrived in the city of León, Nicaragua, where he met with the commander-in-chief of the Nicaraguan armed forces, José Anacleto &quot;Cleto&quot; Ordóñez. For Morazán the meeting paid off; the Nicaraguan leader provided him with weapons and a contingent of 135 men. These men were joined by Colonel Zepeda&#x27;s troops from El Salvador, and some columns of Honduran volunteers in Choluteca, Honduras.

When Justo Milla discovered the presence of Morazán in southern Honduras, he quickly moved his troops to Tegucigalpa, where he established his headquarters, meanwhile Morazán headed for Sabanagrande. At 9am on November 11, Morazán faced General Milla in the memorable battle of &#x27;La Trinidad&#x27;. After five hours of intense fighting in a hill used by the Justo Milla forces, Morazan disguised a plan for attack at the flanks using the fresh and rested troops coming from El Salvador, at last moment the troop from El Salvador reached the hill and attacked the rear forces from Justo Milla, driving Milla&#x27;s forces to the front shock army from Morazan. Milla&#x27;s federal troops were crushed by Morazán&#x27;s men. Milla and few of his officers survived and fled the scene of battle. Following this victory, Morazán marched to Comayagua where he was declared Honduras&#x27; new Chief of State.

===Civil War===
Following his victory at &#x27;La Trinidad&#x27;, Morazán emerged as the leader of the liberal movement and his military skills became known throughout Central America. For these reasons, Morazán received calls for help from liberals in El Salvador. As in Honduras, Salvadorans opposed the new congressmen and other government officials elected by the decree issued on October 10, 1826. They demanded their restitution, but President Manuel Arce argued that this move was necessary to re-establish the constitutional order. El Salvador responded by attempting to take-over the federal government through military force. President Arce, however, defeated the Salvadoran army in Arrazola on March 23, 1828. He then ordered 2,000 federal troops under the command of General Manuel de Arzu to occupy El Salvador. This event marked the beginning of the civil war.

Francisco Morazán accepted the challenge. He placed Diego Vigil as Honduras&#x27;s new head of state and left for Texiguat, where he prepared the Salvadoran campaign. In April 1828, Morazán headed to El Salvador with a force of 1,400 men. This group of militants, known as the &quot;Army Protector of the Law&quot;, was composed of small groups of Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Salvadorans, who brought their own tools of war; others had the support of Indians who served as infantry. Some volunteers continued his liberal convictions, others worked for a political leader, others simply hoped to get something for their efforts after the war ended. This was the combination of forces that joined Morazán in their fight against federal troops.

While the Salvadoran army battled the Federal forces in San Salvador, Morazán positioned himself in the eastern part of the state. On July 6, Morazán defeated Col. Vicente Dominguez&#x27;s Federal troops at the &#x27;El Gualcho&#x27; ranch in Nuevo Gualcho. In his memoirs, Morazán described the battle like this: &quot;At 12 midnight I undertook my march... but the rain didn&#x27;t let me turn the day, and I was forced to wait in El Gualcho... At 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning, the rain stopped, I put two companies of hunters on the hill overlooking to the left of the ranch... At 5 o&#x27;clock I learned the position occupied by the enemy... I could not go back under these circumstances... It was no longer possible to continue the march, without serious danger, a vast plain and the very presence of the enemy. Less I could defend myself in the ranch, placed under a height of more than 200 feet... It was therefore necessary to accept the battle with all the advantages reached by the enemy... I ordered the hunters to advance over the enemy to stop their movement... While the force rose by a slope and narrow path, fire broke out... But 175 inexperienced soldiers made impotent for quarter of an hour, the repeated attacks by the bulk of the enemy. The enthusiasm that produced in all the soldiers the heroism of these brave Hondurans, exceeded the number of the enemy. When the action became general on both sides, our right wing was forced to back down. And occupied the light artillery that supported it. But the reserve working on that side, re-established our line, recovered the artillery and ended the action... The Salvadorans assistants... arrived in time to pursue the dispersed...&quot; enemy soldiers.

Morazán kept on fighting around San Miguel, defeating every platoon dispatched by General Arzu from San Salvador. This prompted Arzu to leave Col. Montufar in charge of San Salvador and personally deal with Morazán. When the &#x27;liberal caudillo&#x27; learned about this, he left for Honduras to recruit more troops. On September 20, Gen. Arzu was along the Lempa River with 500 men in pursuit of Morazán, when he learned that his forces had capitulated in Mejicanos. In the meantime, Morazán returned to El Salvador with a respectable army. Arzu feigning illness returned to Guatemala, leaving his forces under the command of lieutenant colonel Antonio de Aycinena. The colonel and his troops then marched towards Honduran territory, when they were intercepted by Morazán&#x27;s men in San Antonio. On October 9 Aycinena was forced to surrender. With the capitulation of San Antonio, El Salvador was finally free of federal troops. On October 23, Morazán triumphantly entered the plaza of San Salvador. A few days later, he marched on Ahuachapán, to organize the army with which he intended to invade Guatemala.

===Guatemala===

In Ahuachapán Morazán made every effort to organize a large army. He asked the government of El Salvador to provide 4,000 men, but had to settle for 2,000. When he was in position to act in early 1829, he sent a division commanded by Juan Prem to enter Guatemalan territory and to take control of Chiquimula. The order was carried out by Prem in spite of the resistance offered by the enemy. Shortly after, Morazán placed a small force near Guatemala City under the command of Col. Gutierrez to force the enemy out of their trenches and to cause the defection of their troops. Col. Dominguez had left from Guatemala City with 600 infantrymen to attack Prem but he was informed about Gutierrez&#x27;s small force. He changed his course of action and went after Gutierrez. This opportunity was seized by Prem who then moved from Zacapa and on to Dominguez&#x27;s forces, defeating them on January 15, 1829. Prem then was ordered to march with 1400 men under his command to occupy the post of San José, near the capital city.

Meanwhile, the people of Antigua organized against the Guatemalan government and placed the department of Sacatepéquez under Morazán&#x27;s protection. This prompted Morazán to invade Guatemala with his &#x27;Protector Army of the law&#x27;. Morazán situated his men in the village of Pinula near the capital city. Military operations on the capital began with small skirmishes in front of government fortifications. On February 15 one of Morazán&#x27;s largest divisions under the command of Cayetano de la Cerda was defeated in Mixco by federal troops. Due to this defeat Morazán lifted the siege of the city and concentrated his forces in Antigua. A strong division of federal troops followed him from the capital under the command of Col. Pacheco, heading towards Sumpango and Tejar with the purpose of attacking Morazán in Antigua. But Pacheco spread his forces, leaving some of them in Sumpango. When he went into San Miguelito with a smaller army, he was beaten by Morazán. This incident raised the morale of Morazán&#x27;s men once again.

After the victory of San Miguelito, Morazán&#x27;s army grew larger when Guatemalan volunteers joined his ranks. On March 15 when Morazán was on his way to occupy his former positions, he was intercepted by Col. Prado&#x27;s Federal troops at the &#x27;Las Charcas&#x27; ranch. Morazán, with a superior position, crushed Prado&#x27;s army. The battlefield was left full of dead bodies, prisoners and weapons, and Morazán moved on to recover his former positions in Pinula and Aceytuno, and to put Guatemala City under siege again.

General Verveer, plenipotentiary minister of the king of the Netherlands to the Central America Federation, attempted to mediate between the Government under siege and Morazán, but they could not reach an agreement. Military operations continued, with great success for the allied army. On April 12, Guatemala&#x27;s Chief of State, Mariano Aycinena, capitulated and the next day the Central Plaza was occupied by Morazán&#x27;s troops. Immediately thereafter President Arce, Mariano Aycinena, Mariano Beltranena, and all the officials who had had some role in the war were sent to prison. After these events, the General ran the country dictatorially, until senator Juan Barrundia took over on June 25, 1829.

==Presidency==

===Acting presidency, 1829===
After overthrowing the previous government of President Arce, Morazán ran the country dictatorially, until Barrundia took over on June 25, 1829.

===First term, 1830–1834===

Francisco Morazán won the popular vote of the 1830 presidential election, against the conservative challenger José del Valle. He was inaugurated on September 16. In his inaugural speech he declared: &quot;The sovereign people send me, to place myself, in the most dangerous of their destinies. I must obey and fulfill, the solemn oath that I have just rendered. I offer, to uphold the Federal Constitution, which I defended as a soldier and as a citizen.&quot;

With Morazán&#x27;s as president and governors sponsored by him, the liberals had consolidated power. The General was now in position to advance his liberal reforms. Through them, he attempted to dismantle what he felt were archaic Spanish institutions, and to give to his people a society based upon general education, religious liberty and social and political equality. In 1831 Morazán and Governor Mariano Gálvez turned Guatemala into a testing ground for these &#x27;enlightenment-like&#x27; policies. They oversaw the building of schools and roads, enacted free trade policies, invited foreign capital and immigrants, allowed secular marriage and divorce and freedom of speech, tried to make public lands available to the expanding cochineal economy, separated church from state, abolished tithes, proclaimed religious liberties, confiscated church property, suppressed religious orders, and removed education from church control, among other policies.

All of this new approved legislation struck a blow at the heart of the Guatemalan oligarchy. But more importantly, it stripped the Spanish clergy of their privileges, and curtailed their power. According to historian Mary Wilhelmine Williams: &quot;The immediate reasons for the different enactments varied. Some laws were intended to protect the state from the clergy ... others aimed to help the recoup the public treasure, and at the same time sweep away aristocratic privilege; while still other legislation – especially that of latter date – was enacted for the punishment of opposition to earlier acts and of intrigues against the government&quot; when Francisco Morazán first came to power. Back then, the General had to expel from the country archbishop Ramon Casaus and certain members of the monastic orders, because they were under suspicion of opposing independence. They used their influence against him and the Liberal Party during the civil war. They also had opposed the reforms, particularly those in the interest of general education which the Liberals were determined to push.

In March 1832, another conflict erupted in El Salvador. Chief of State, José María Cornejo had rebelled against some federal decrees, which prompted President Morazán to act. The commander in chief at the head of the Federal Troops marched on to El Salvador, where they defeated Cornejo&#x27;s State Army on March 14. On the 28th of the same month, Morazán had occupied San Salvador. From that point forward, rumors about the need to reform the constitution began.

=== Second term, 1834–1838 ===
In 1834 at the request of Governor, Mariano Galvez, the General moved the capital city to Sonsonate and later to San Salvador. The same year, the first four years of Francisco Morazán&#x27;s presidency had ended. According to the constitution, elections needed to be held in order to elect the next president of the Republic. Moderate, José Cecilio del Valle ran against the incumbent president; for this reason, General Francisco Morazán deposited the presidency on General Gregorio Salazar, so the federal congress could verify the fairness of the election.

When all the votes were counted, José del Valle had defeated Francisco Morazán. The Federal elections showed strong popular opposition to liberal reforms. Valle, however, died before taking office. Most historians agree that had he lived, he might have brought conciliation and harmony between the opposing forces (Liberals and Conservatives). On June 2, the Federal Congress called for new elections, which were won by Francisco Morazán. On February 14, 1835, General Morazán, was sworn as president for a second term.

=== End of the federation ===

In February 1837 there occurred in Central America a series of events that ignited a revolution that culminated with the fall of the Federation. An epidemic of cholera scourged Guatemala leaving approximately 1000 people dead and 3000 infected with the bacteria. The epidemic struck especially the poor and the Indians in the highlands of the state. At the time when it appeared, the Indians of the district of Mita, influenced by their priests, were much perturbed over the system of trial by jury (incomprehensible to them) which was being introduced. The disease spread rapidly and the government of Mariano Galvez, hoping to alleviate the situation, dispatched the available physicians, medical students and remedies for distribution. But these measures were of little help because the Indians continued to die.

The church viewed this as an opportunity to strike back at the liberal government of Mariano Gálvez. The local priests spread the rumor that the government had poisoned the rivers and streams for the purpose of wiping out the indigenous population, and repopulating it with foreigners. In proof, they pointed to a recent grant of territory in Vera Paz made to a British colonization company. A cry was then raised by the frantic Indians against their supposed murderers. As the cholera continued to spread the Indians took to arms, killed whites and liberals, burned their houses, and prepared to confront Galvez&#x27;s government.

The governor sent an army to try to stop the revolt. But the army&#x27;s measures were so repressive, that it only made matters worse. By June Santa Rosa erupted, and from the village of Mataquescuintla emerged a young Rafael Carrera. Carrera was an illiterate, but shrewd and charismatic swineherd turned highwayman, whom the rebels wanted as their leader. The priests proclaimed to the natives that he was their protecting angel Rafael, descended from the heavens to take vengeance on the heretics, Liberals and foreigners and to restore their ancient dominion. They devised various tricks to favor the delusion, which were heralded as miracles. A letter was let down from the roof of one of the churches, in the midst of a vast congregation of Indians, which was supposed to come from the Virgin Mary, commissioning Carrera to lead a revolt against the government.

Under cries of &quot;Long live religion!&quot;, and &quot;Death to foreigners!&quot;, Carrera and his forces initiated a war against the government. Encouraged by these events the conservatives joined in. The liberal government called General Morazán for help. Francisco Morazán repeatedly defeated Carrera&#x27;s forces and pacified the state, but he could never catch the Indian leader, as he simply retreated to the mountains and came back to re-occupy the key positions as soon as Morazán&#x27;s troops left.

By 1838 Morazán was presiding over a dying institution. Galvez had relinquished power, Congress tried to restore some life to the Federal Government by transferring control of their custom revenues. But Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica opposed this move and used it as an opportunity to leave the union. The Federation was dead. On February 1, 1839, Morazán had completed his second constitutional term as president, congress had dissolved and there was no legal basis to name his successor. In the end a failure at compromise, the power of the church, bitter infighting between conservatives and liberals, and the quest for personal glory were the main reasons for the downfall of the &#x27;Federation&#x27;.

== Chief of state ==

After Francisco Morazán&#x27;s second term as President of the Federal Republic ended, he was left without political or military power. On July 13, 1839, however, the general was elected Chief of State of El Salvador.
When Rafael Carrera and the Guatemalan conservatives learned about Morazán&#x27;s new role, they declared war on El Salvador. Francisco Morazán personified the &#x27;Old Federation&#x27; itself and for that reason alone they vowed to defeat him. On July 24, Guatemala and Nicaragua signed a treaty of alliance against Morazán&#x27;s government. Carrera called on the Salvadoran people to rise against their government. These calls resulted in small uprisings within El Salvador, but these were quickly put down without much effort by Morazán.

When Carrera&#x27;s attempt failed, Morazán&#x27;s enemies formed an army of Nicaraguan and Honduran troops. On September 25, 1839, these forces invaded El Salvador and faced Morazán&#x27;s army during the battle of San Pedro Perulapán. The general only needed 600 Salvadorans to defeat 2,000 men commanded by generals Francisco Ferrera, Nicolás de Espinosa, and Manuel Quijano. After their defeat, the humiliated generals and their troops fled to neighboring states, leaving behind over three hundred dead.

===Defeat===
On March 18, 1840 Morazán made a last attempt to restore the &#x27;Union&#x27;. He gathered what he thought were enough Salvadoran forces to face Carrera, and with them marched to Guatemala. Once positioned, Morazán moved in from the south, striking towards the capital. Carrera pulled most of his own force out of the capital, leaving only a small, very visible garrison inside. Morazán jumped in, slaughtered much of the bait, then found himself assaulted from all directions by Carrera&#x27;s main force of about 5,000 men.

The battle became notorious for its savagery and revealed the ruthless side of Carrera. whose Indians sang Salve Regina, and shouted &quot;Long Live Carrera!&quot;, &quot;Death to Morazán!&quot; By the next morning, Morazán was running out of ammunition. He then ordered an increase in fire from three corners of the plaza, in order to attract attention, while he himself slipped out through the fourth corner of the plaza with a small escort, to escape back to El Salvador.

This time, the general did not have the support he needed from the common people, as he had had in 1830. The &#x27;Liberal reforms&#x27; had not produced enough results for the citizenry; moreover, they resented some of these reforms. This was the case with the Livingston Code, which changed the system of taxation, among other reforms. As for the &#x27;Liberals&#x27;, they were too busy fighting among themselves that even former liberal president, José Francisco Barrundia had joined Rafael Carrera. Morazán&#x27;s defeat was so decisive that on March 27, he deposited the headquarters of the State in the hands of director José Antonio Canas and directed a proclamation to the people of El Salvador. Morazán did not want to cause any more problems for the Salvadorans. With Francisco Morazán&#x27;s final defeat, the hopes of a Central American federation vanished.

==Exile in South America==

On April 8, 1840, General Francisco Morazán went into exile. He left from the port of La Libertad in El Salvador, and embarked on the schooner &quot;Izalco&quot; accompanied by 30 of his closest friends and war veterans. He stopped in Costa Rica where he sought and obtained political asylum for most of his companions. Seven continued on the journey to South America with him. Morazán landed at Chiriquí Province, then moved on to David, Chiriquí where his family awaited him. While in David, Morazán was informed by his friends of the fierce persecutions suffered by his supporters at the hands of Rafael Carrera and other Central American leaders. Outraged by this and by the chain of insults and slander against him by some members of the press, he wrote and published his famous &#x27;Manifest of David&#x27; dated July 16, 1841.

While he was still in David, Morazán also received calls from his liberal colleagues in Costa Rica. Braulio Carrillo, governor of that state, had restricted individual liberties, placed limits on freedom of the press, and derogated the Political Constitution of 1825. He replaced it with a new constitutional charter, denominated &quot;Law of Bases and Guarantees&quot;, where he declared himself &#x27;Chief of State for Life&#x27;. Furthermore, Carrillo declared Costa Rica a free and independent state. However, Morazán wanted to stay away from Central America affairs, and travelled to Peru. Once in Lima, he received the invitation of Mariscal Agustín Gamarra to command a Peruvian division, at a time when his country was at war with Chile. But Morazán declined, because he found this war very confusing and troubling. Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Chile were all involved in a twelve-year war, which brought about a train of baneful stages of chaos, among all countries involved.

In Peru, Morazán was fortunate to find good friends with whom he shared the same ideals. These included Generals José Rufino Echenique and Pedro Bermudez. Around 1841, the English began to intervene in the Mosquito territory, located between Honduras and Nicaragua. This intervention prompted Morazán to end his self-imposed Peruvian exile, and he decided that it was time to return to Central America. With the financial backing of General Pedro Bermudez, he departed from Callao on board the &quot;Crusader&quot; in late December 1841. On that trip he was accompanied by General Cabañas and Saravia, and five other officers. He and his companions made stops in Guayaquil, Ecuador and Chiriqui where he met with his family before returning to Central America.

On January 15, 1842, Morazán arrived in El Salvador. He made himself available to the Central American leaders for the common defense against the British intervention. On February 16, 1842, he told his countrymen that his return was a &quot;duty&quot; and an &quot;irresistible national sentiment&quot;, not only for him but for all &quot;those who have a heart for their homeland.&quot; But his offers were rejected, nonetheless.

After this episode, he put forth a plan to overthrow Costa Rican head of State Braulio Carrillo. Carrillo, a reformer responsible for the expansion of coffee production in Costa Rica, had taken the first steps towards ending Costa Rica&#x27;s political links with Central America.

In La Union, El Salvador, Morazán hired three boats. He then travelled to Acajutla, San Salvador and Sonsonate where he was able to reactivate the local forces. From Acajutla, he left for the island of Martin Perez, located on the Gulf of Fonseca. There he organized a military contingent of about 500 men. On April 7 and without any mishap, Morazán&#x27;s fleet of five vessels landed at Port of Caldera in Costa Rica.

When Braulio Carrillo was informed of the presence of Morazán in Costa Rica, he organized a military force under the command of General Vicente Villasenor. On April 9, 1842, Morazán issued a proclamation to the people of Costa Rica in which he stated that he was never indifferent to the &quot;misfortunes&quot; of the Costa Rican people. &quot;Your cries&quot;, he said, &quot;have for a long time hurt my ears, and I finally found the means to save you, even at the expense of my own life&quot;.

Morazán avoided an armed confrontation with the forces sent by Carrillo. Through negotiations, in which he offered Villaseñor higher positions once the Federation was restored, he got him to betray his government. They signed &quot;The Jocote Accord&quot;. This agreement provided for the integration of a single military body, the convening of a National Constituent Assembly, the ousting of Braulio Carrillo and other members of his administration, and the installation of a provisional government under the command of Francisco Morazán. On April 13, 1842, Morazán&#x27;s forces entered the city of San José.

Thereafter Chief Carrillo was forced to accept the treaty. He approved it only when some modifications were added. He then turned the government over to Morazán and left the country. Morazán&#x27;s first act was to open the doors of the state to Costa Rican and Central American political refugees. He then abolished the laws that Carrillo had imposed limiting trade and property, restored individual and political rights, devoted himself to urgent reforms, and convened the Constituent Assembly, which appointed him Supreme Chief of the Costa Rican State.

According to historian Gomez Carrillo, in the months that followed, Morazán concentrated on recruiting military personnel for the purpose of &#x27;restoring the Central America motherland.&#x27; Thereafter, rumors of the possibility of war against the neighboring states spread. This troubled Costa Ricans; they feared Rafael Carrera would intervene in their affairs, specially after Guatemala broke ties with them. In addition they felt financially incapable of sustaining a war, and also considered it unnecessary. After all, the restoration of the &#x27;Union&#x27; was a cause they didn&#x27;t believe in. For all these reasons they decided to conspire against Morazán.

===Death===

On September 11, 1842, a popular movement opposed to Morazán erupted in San José. Led by Portuguese General António Pinto Soares, 400 men attacked Morazán&#x27;s guard of 40 Salvadorans. Morazán and his men managed to repel the attacks and retreat to their headquarters. The fighting continued bloody and relentless, and the insurgents increased to 1,000, while the number of the besieged diminished. Chaplain José Castro then proposed a capitulation to Morazán ensuring his life, but he refused. After 88 hours of fighting, Morazán and his closest collaborators resolved to break the siege. General José Cabañas with 30 men held the retreat, which made it possible for the others to flee towards Cartago.

But the insurrection had spread there too, so Morazán turned for help to his friend, Pedro Mayorga. But Mayorga betrayed him, and turned him over to his enemies along with generals, Vicente Villaseñor, José Saravia and José Trinidad Cabañas. Saravia committed suicide, Villaseñor attempted the same but survived. Subsequently, Morazán and Vicente Villaseñor were sentenced to death. On September 15, Morazán and Villaseñor were transferred to the central plaza in San José.

Before his execution, Morazán dictated his famous will to his son, Francisco. In it, he calls his death &quot;murder&quot; and declares, &quot;I do not have enemies, nor the smaller resentment I take to the grave against my murderers, I forgive them and wish them the greatest good.&quot; When he was done, a chair was offered to him but he refused it. Seated next to him was Gen. Villaseñor, sedated and almost unconscious. Morazán then said, &quot;Dear friend, posterity will do us justice&quot; and crossed himself. A few minutes later, Morazán himself commanded the firing squad that ended his life and that of Villaseñor.

With his death, the nation lost a man described by José Martí as &quot;a powerful genius, a strategist, a speaker, a true statesman, perhaps the only one Central America has ever produced&quot;. In 1848, the government of José María Castro sent Morazán&#x27;s remains to El Salvador, fulfilling one of his last wishes.

==Politics and the failed Federation==
More than a man of ideas, Morazán was a man of action wrote biographer Rafael Eliodoro Valle. But his name cannot fail to brighten the history of ideas in Central America, because he knew how to instill in them; the power of his sincerity, the passion that inflamed him, and his faith in the future, like men of vision who always think big. Francisco Morazán pushed with his liberal and progressive ideas a series of revolutionary measures for the time. Thus, promoting education, immigration, established freedom of worship and the press. The first federal administration headed by Morazán was oriented to the peaceful reconstruction of the several States that comprised the republic.

When liberalism seemed to finally find the opportunity to implement its noblest principles, after a long process of integration as ideological tendency, as a political group and as a power option, the liberal regime was unable to achieve cohesion within the Central American society. The Liberals&#x27; sustained fight against the aristocracy and their quest to exclude conservatives from political life was not accompanied by a parallel effort to integrate other sectors such as indigenous people, (The bulk of the population) to the national modern project that they so vehemently postulated. The indigenous people never found the liberal proposal to be attractive enough, so as to break free from the deep rooted ancient order taught by the Church and the stability they have had for three centuries under the colonial regime.

According to writer, David Alejandro Luna, one of Morazán&#x27;s biggest mistakes was to not design a plan to break the feudal estates where his secular enemies were sitting ... Morazán&#x27;s fight was marred of romanticism, his strategic line tended to politically displace the oppressive aristocratic landowners of Central America, his tactics, however, disagreed with the political reality. Despite the strenuous efforts made by General Francisco Morazán from the presidency of the Republic. The clerical and aristocratic forces staged a strong anti-liberal building block taking advantage of the fanaticism and discontent that permeated large sections of the population, especially in the state of Guatemala.

===Legacy===

Francisco Morazán became a martyr and a symbol of the Republic of Central America. He gave his life however unsuccessfully, attempting to preserve the &#x27;Union&#x27;. Now, more than 160 years after his death, Central America is still plagued by power struggles, corruption, and poverty. More often than not, the five republics have emulated Carrera than Morazán; but the dream of The Great Central American Country is still alive. His image can be found in bills, logos, and stamps. Institutions, cities, departments, schools, and parks among other things bear Morazán&#x27;s name, in order to preserve his legacy.

El Salvador was among the first countries to pay tribute to Morazán. On March 14, 1887. The National Assembly of the Republic of El Salvador replaced the name of the department of &quot;Gotera&quot; with &quot;Morazán&quot;. So as &quot;to perpetuate the name of the great leader of the Central American Union&quot;. In 1943, Honduras renamed the Tegucigalpa department, Francisco Morazán. On November 15, 1887, the town of Tocoy Tzimá became &#x27;Morazán&#x27; in Guatemala. In 1945, Port Morazán was founded in Nicaragua.

Costa Rica, the country that he invaded and where he died honored him with a park in the center of its capital San Jose. 

In the political field, the idea of integration is still preserved in the mind of many Central Americans. For example, there is the Central American Parliament, also known by the abbreviation &quot;Parlacen&quot; (from the Spanish &quot;Parlamento Centroamericano&quot;). This is a political institution devoted to the integration of the Central American countries. The Parlacen represents a modern version of the historic Federal Republic of Central America. Although it does not include Costa Rica, it does include the Dominican Republic. Panama used to be a member but left during the government of President Martinelli.

In the past several unsuccessful attempts have been made to restore the &#x27;Union&#x27; (1851, 1886, 1921)

Morazán&#x27;s legacy is also present in the arts. The first play on record in El Salvador is titled &quot;La Tragedy of Morazán&quot; written by Francisco Díaz (1812–45) and dramatizing the life of the Central American president. The modern period in Honduran theater began with Luis Andrés Zúñiga Portillo when he wrote &quot;Los Conspiradores&quot; (The Conspirators, 1916), a historic drama that honored the virtues of Francisco Morazán. In his book &quot;Canto General&quot;, Pablo Neruda also pays tribute to the &#x27;Liberal Caudillo&#x27;, with a poem to Central America.

Statues and busts of Francisco Morazán can be found in Chile, El Salvador, United States, Spain, and elsewhere. The most famous and controversial is the equestrian statue of Morazán located in Tegucigalpa&#x27;s Central Park.

In his 1971 book &quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot;, Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano mentions that this statue is that of French Marshal Michel Ney. According to Galeano, the statue was bought at a flea market, because the persons entrusted to buy it, spent the money in binges. Galeano later retracted. The story was also mentioned by Gabriel García Márquez in his 1982 Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

Research by scholar Rafael Leiva Vivas debunked this tale, showing that the statue was contracted for, that French sculptor Léopold Morice&#x27;s name appears on the base, and that sculptor and architect Francisco Durini was also involved (either as collaborator or intermediary).

The movie &quot;Morazán&quot; (2017), Honduras&#x27;s very first submission to the Academy Awards (Foreign Language Film), depicts Morazán&#x27;s last days.

A species of Honduran lizard, &quot;Anolis morazani&quot;, is named in his honor.

<text>NPO Lavochkin (, OKB-301, also called Lavochkin Research and Production Association or shortly Lavochkin Association, LA) is a Russian aerospace company. It is a major player in the Russian space program, being the developer and manufacturer of the Fregat upper stage, as well as interplanetary probes such as Fobos-Grunt. As of 2015, it was headed by Sergei Lemeshevskii. On 10 August 2017 the Lavochkin Association&#x27;s Board of Directors appointed Vladimir Kolmykov Director General of the enterprise.

==Overview==
The company develops and manufactures spacecraft such as the Fregat rocket upper stages, satellites and interplanetary probes. It is a contractor for a number of military programs, such as the Oko early warning satellite, Prognoz and Araks programmes as well as the civilian program Kupon. One of the company&#x27;s most notable projects was the participation in the failed Fobos-Grunt sample return mission. NPO Lavochkin has also developed the Elektro–L series of new-generation weather satellites, as well as the Navigator standardised satellite platform, which will serve as the basis for several future Russian satellites.

==History==
The company was founded in 1937 as OKB-301, a Soviet aircraft design bureau (OKB). The head designer was , supported by and Semyon Lavochkin. In October 1945 Lavochkin was promoted for the head designer of the design bureau. The bureau gained distinction for its family of piston-engined fighter aircraft during World War II, and later shifted to missile and jet fighter designs. Following the death of the head designer, the OKB-301 succumbed to the growing power of Vladimir Chelomey and became OKB-52 Branch No. 3 on 18 December 1962. Later, it turned to work on interplanetary probe designs for Luna sample return program, the Lunokhod program, Vega program, Phobos program, etc. The former OKB-301 became named NPO Lavochkin.

In January 2012, officials of Lavochkin faced administrative punishment for not taking into account of designing the computer system after the crash of Russia&#x27;s Mars moon spacecraft Fobos-Grunt.

<doc id="219210" wikidata="Q15738686" url="?curid=219210" title="Copy protection">
<text>Copy protection, also known as content protection, copy prevention and copy restriction, is any measure to enforce copyright by preventing the reproduction of software, films, music, and other media.

Copy protection is most commonly found on videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, HD-DVDs, computer software discs, video game discs and cartridges, audio CDs and some VCDs. It also may be incorporated into digitally distributed versions of media and software.

Some methods of copy protection have also led to criticism because it caused inconvenience for paying consumers or secretly installed additional or unwanted software to detect copying activities on the consumer&#x27;s computer. Making copy protection effective while protecting consumer rights remains a problem with media publication.

== Terminology ==

Media corporations have always used the term copy protection, but critics argue that the term tends to sway the public into identifying with the publishers, who favor restriction technologies, rather than with the users. Copy prevention and copy control may be more neutral terms. &quot;Copy protection&quot; is a misnomer for some systems, because any number of copies can be made from an original and all of these copies will work, but only in one computer, or only with one dongle, or only with another device that cannot be easily copied.

The term is also often related to, and confused with, the concept of digital restrictions management. Digital restrictions management is a more general term because it includes all sorts of management of works, including copy restrictions. Copy restriction may include measures that are not digital. A more appropriate term may be &quot;technological protection measures&quot; (TPMs), which is often defined as the use of technological tools in order to restrict the use or access to a work.

== Business rationale ==
Unauthorized copying and distribution accounted for $2.4billion per year in lost revenue in the United States alone in 1990, and is assumed to be causing impact on revenues in the music and the video game industry, leading to proposal of stricter copyright laws such as PIPA.

Copy protection is most commonly found on videotapes, DVDs, computer software discs, video game discs and cartridges, audio CDs and some VCDs.

Many media formats are easy to copy using a machine, allowing consumers to distribute copies to their friends, a practice known as &quot;casual copying&quot;.

Companies publish works under copyright protection because they believe that the cost of implementing the copy protection will be less than the revenue produced by consumers who buy the product instead of acquiring it through casually copied media.

Opponents of copy protection argue that people who obtain free copies only use what they can get for free and would not purchase their own copy if they were unable to obtain a free copy. Some even argue that free copies increase profit; people who receive a free copy of a music CD may then go and buy more of that band&#x27;s music, which they would not have done otherwise.

Some publishers have avoided copy-protecting their products on the theory that the resulting inconvenience to their users outweighs any benefit of frustrating &quot;casual copying&quot;.

From the perspective of the end user, copy protection is always a cost. DRM and license managers sometimes fail, are inconvenient to use, and may not afford the user all of the legal use of the product they have purchased.

The term &quot;copy protection&quot; refers to the technology used to attempt to frustrate copying, and not to the legal remedies available to publishers or authors whose copyrights are violated. Software usage models range from node locking to floating licenses (where a fixed number licenses can be concurrently used across an enterprise), grid computing (where multiple computers function as one unit and so use a common license) and electronic licensing (where features can be purchased and activated online). The term &quot;license management&quot; refers to broad platforms which enable the specification, enforcement and tracking of software licenses. To safeguard copy protection and license management technologies themselves against tampering and hacking, software antitamper methods are used.

Floating licenses are also being referred to as &quot;Indirect Licenses&quot;, and are licenses that at the time they are issued, there is no actual user who will use them. That has some technical influence over some of their characteristics. &quot;Direct Licenses&quot; are issued after a certain user requires it. As an example, an activated Microsoft product, contains a &quot;Direct License&quot; which is locked to the PC where the product is installed.

From business standpoint, on the other hand, some services now try to monetize on additional services other than the media content so users can have better experience than simply obtaining the copied product.

== Technical challenges ==
From a technical standpoint, it seems impossible to completely prevent users from making copies of the media they purchase, as long as a &quot;writer&quot; is available that can write to blank media. All types of media require a &quot;player&quot;—a CD player, DVD player, videotape player, computer or video game console—which must be able to read the media in order to display it to a human. Logically, a player could be built that reads the media and then writes an exact copy of what was read to the same type of media.

At a minimum, digital copy protection of non-interactive works is subject to the analog hole: regardless of any digital restrictions, if music can be heard by the human ear, it can also be recorded (at the very least, with a microphone and tape recorder); if a film can be viewed by the human eye, it can also be recorded (at the very least, with a video camera and recorder). In practice, almost-perfect copies can typically be made by tapping into the analog output of a player (e.g. the speaker output or headphone jacks) and, once redigitized into an unprotected form, duplicated indefinitely. Copying text-based content in this way is more tedious, but the same principle applies: if it can be printed or displayed, it can also be scanned and OCRed. With basic software and some patience, these techniques can be applied by a typical computer-literate user.

Since these basic technical facts exist, it follows that a determined individual will definitely succeed in copying any media, given enough time and resources. Media publishers understand this; copy protection is not intended to stop professional operations involved in the unauthorized mass duplication of media, but rather to stop &quot;casual copying&quot;.

Copying of information goods which are downloaded (rather than being mass-duplicated as with physical media) can be inexpensively customized for each download, and thus restricted more effectively, in a process known as &quot;traitor tracing&quot;. They can be encrypted in a fashion which is unique for each user&#x27;s computer, and the decryption system can be made tamper-resistant.

Copyright protection in content platforms also cause increased market concentration and a loss in aggregate welfare. According to research on the European Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market on platform competition, only users of large platforms will be allowed to upload content if the content is sufficiently valuable and network effects are strong.

== Methods ==
=== Computer software ===
Copy protection for computer software, especially for games, has been a long struggle between publishers and crackers. These were (and are) programmers who defeated copy protection on software as a hobby, add their alias to the title screen, and then distribute the &quot;cracked&quot; product to the network of warez BBSes or Internet sites that specialized in distributing unauthorized copies of software.

==== Early ages ==== 

When computer software was still distributed in audio cassettes, audio copying was unreliable, while digital copying was time consuming. Software prices were comparable with audio cassette prices. To make digital copying more difficult, many programs used non-standard loading methods (loaders incompatible with standard BASIC loaders, or loaders that used different transfer speed).

Unauthorized software copying began to be a problem when floppy disks became the common storage media. The ease of copying depended on the system; Jerry Pournelle wrote in &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1983 that &quot;CP/M doesn&#x27;t lend itself to copy protection&quot; so its users &quot;haven&#x27;t been too worried&quot; about it, while &quot;Apple users, though, have always had the problem. So have those who used TRS-DOS, and I understand that MS-DOS has copy protection features&quot;.

==== 1980s ====
Pournelle disliked copy protection and, except for games, refused to review software that used it. He did not believe that it was useful, writing in 1983 that &quot;For every copy protection scheme there&#x27;s a hacker ready to defeat it. Most involve so-called nibble/nybble copiers, which try to analyze the original disk and then make a copy&quot;. In 1985, he wrote that &quot;dBASE III is copy-protected with one of those &#x27;unbreakable&#x27; systems, meaning that it took the crackers almost three weeks to break it&quot;. IBM&#x27;s Don Estridge agreed: &quot;I guarantee that whatever scheme you come up with will take less time to break than to think of it.&quot; While calling piracy &quot;a threat to software development. It&#x27;s going to dry up the software&quot;, he said &quot;It&#x27;s wrong to copy-protect programs... There ought to be some way to stop [piracy] without creating products that are unusable&quot;.

Software vendors disliked piracy, but did not attempt to sue the vendors of nibble copiers because copyright law allows users to produce backup copies of software. Unlike music piracy, no significant software piracy market existed. A more serious problem was a company or other large organization purchasing a single copy of an application and producing many copies for itself. Philippe Kahn of Borland justified copy-protecting Sidekick because, unlike his company&#x27;s unprotected Turbo Pascal, Sidekick can be used without accompanying documentation and is for a general audience. Kahn said, according to Pournelle, that &quot;any good hacker can defeat the copy protection in about an hour&quot;; its purpose was to prevent large companies from purchasing one copy and easily distributing it internally. While reiterating his dislike of copy protection, Pournelle wrote &quot;I can see Kahn&#x27;s point&quot;.

In 1989, Gilman Louie, head of Spectrum HoloByte, stated that copy protection added about $0.50 per copy to the cost of production of a game. Other software relied on complexity; &quot;Antic&quot; in 1988 observed that WordPerfect for the Atari ST &quot;is almost unusable without its manual of over 600 pages!&quot;. (The magazine was mistaken; the ST version was so widely pirated that the company threatened to discontinue it.)

Copy protection sometimes causes software not to run on clones, such as the Apple IIcompatible Laser 128, or even the genuine Commodore 64 with certain peripherals.

To limit reusing activation keys to install the software on multiple machines, it has been attempted to tie the installed software to a specific machine by involving some unique feature of the machine. Serial number in ROM could not be used because some machines do not have them. Some popular surrogate for a machine serial number were date and time (to the second) of initialization of the hard disk drive or MAC address of Ethernet cards (although this is programmable on modern cards). With the rise of virtualization, however, the practice of locking has to add to these simple hardware parameters to still prevent copying.

=== Early video games ===
During the 1980s and 1990s, video games sold on audio cassette and floppy disks were sometimes protected with an external user-interactive method that demanded the user to have the original package or a part of it, usually the manual. Copy protection was activated not only at installation, but every time the game was executed.

Several imaginative and creative methods have been employed, in order to be both fun and hard to copy. These include:

* The most common method was requiring the player to enter a specific word (often chosen at random) from the manual. A variant of this technique involved matching a picture provided by the game to one in the manual and providing an answer pertaining to the picture (&quot;Ski or Die&quot;, &quot;4D Sports Boxing&quot; and &quot;James Bond 007: The Stealth Affair&quot; used this technique). &quot;Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s Race Into Space&quot; (in the floppy version, but not the CD version) required the user to input an astronaut&#x27;s total duration in space (available in the manual) before the launch of certain missions. If the answer was incorrect, the mission would suffer a catastrophic failure.
* Manuals containing information and hints vital to the completion of the game, like answers to riddles (&quot;Conquests of Camelot&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI&quot;), recipes of spells (&quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot;), keys to deciphering non-Latin writing systems (&quot;Ultima&quot; series, see also &quot;Ultima&quot; writing systems), maze guides (&quot;&quot;), dialogue spoken by other characters in the game (&quot;Wasteland&quot;, &quot;Dragon Wars&quot;), excerpts of the storyline (most &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; games and &quot;Wing Commander&quot;), or a radio frequency to use to communicate with a character to further a game (&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;).
* Some sort of code with symbols, not existing on the keyboard or the ASCII code. This code was arranged in a grid, and had to be entered via a virtual keyboard at the request &quot;What is the code at line 3 row 2?&quot;. These tables were printed on dark paper (&quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, &quot;Uplink&quot;), or were visible only through a red transparent layer (&quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;), making the paper very difficult to photocopy. Another variant of this method—most famously used on the ZX Spectrum version of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;— was a card with color sequences at each grid reference that had to be entered before starting the game. This also prevented monochrome photocopying. It had been thought that the codes in the tables were based on a mathematical formula which could be calculated by using the row, line and page number if the formula was known, a function of the disk space requirement of the data. Later research proved that this was not the case.
* &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; offered a rotating wheel with halves of pirate&#x27;s faces. The game showed a face composed of two different parts and asked when this pirate was hanged on a certain island. The player then had to match the faces on the wheel, and enter the year that appeared on the island-respective hole. Its &quot;sequel&quot; had the same concept, but with magic potion ingredients. Other games that employed the code wheel system include &quot;Star Control&quot;.
* &quot;Zork&quot; games such as &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; and &quot;Zork Zero&quot; came with &quot;feelies&quot; which contained information vital to the completion of the game. For example, the parchment found from Zork Zero contained clues vital to solving the final puzzle. However, whenever the player attempts to read the parchment, they are referred to the game package.
* The Lenslok system used a plastic prismatic device, shipped with the game, which was used to descramble a code displayed on screen.
* Early copies of &quot;The Playroom&quot; from Broderbund Software included a game called &quot;What Is Missing?&quot;, in which every fifth time the program was booted up, the player would see a pattern and have to refer to the back of the manual to find which of 12objects from the spinner counting game would match the pattern seen on the back of the manual in order to open the game.

All of these methods proved to be troublesome and tiring for the players, and as such greatly declined in usage by the mid-1990s, at which point the emergence of CDs as the primary video game medium made copy protection largely redundant, since CD copying technology was not widely available at the time.

Some game developers, such as Markus Persson, have encouraged consumers and other developers to embrace the reality of unlicensed copying and utilize it positively to generate increased sales and marketing interest.

=== Videotape ===
Starting in 1985 with the video release of &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (Beta and VHS versions only), Macrovision licensed to publishers a technology that exploits the automatic gain control feature of VCRs by adding pulses to the vertical blanking sync signal. These pulses may negatively affect picture quality, but succeed in confusing the recording-level circuitry of many consumer VCRs. This technology, which is aided by U.S. legislation mandating the presence of automatic gain-control circuitry in VCRs, is said to &quot;plug the analog hole&quot; and make VCR-to-VCR copies impossible, although an inexpensive circuit is widely available that will defeat the protection by removing the pulses. Macrovision had patented methods of defeating copy prevention, giving it a more straightforward basis to shut down manufacture of any device that descrambles it than often exists in the DRM world. While used for prerecorded tapes, the system was not adopted for television broadcasts; Michael J. Fuchs of HBO said in 1985 that Macrovision was &quot;not good technology&quot; because it reduced picture quality and consumers could easily bypass it, while Peter Chernin of Showtime said &quot;we want to accommodate our subscribers and we know they like to tape our movies&quot;.

== Notable payloads ==
Over time, software publishers (especially in the case of video games) became creative about crippling the software in case it was duplicated. These games would initially show that the copy was successful, but eventually render themselves unplayable via subtle methods.
Many games use the &quot;code checksumming&quot; technique to prevent alteration of code to bypass other copy protection. Important constants for the gamesuch as the accuracy of the player&#x27;s firing, the speed of their movement, etc.are not included in the game but calculated from the numbers making up the machine code of other parts of the game. If the code is changed, the calculation yields a result which no longer matches the original design of the game and the game plays improperly.

* &quot;Superior Soccer&quot; had no outward signs of copy protection, but if it decided it was not a legitimate copy, it made the soccer ball in the game invisible, making it impossible to play the game.
* In &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot;, if the player entered in the wrong information, they could still play the game, but with substantially increased difficulty.
* As a more satirical nod to the issue, if the thriller-action game &quot;Alan Wake&quot; detects that the game is cracked or a pirated copy, it will replace tips in loading screens with messages telling the player to buy the game. If a new game is created on the copied game, an additional effect will take place. As a more humorous nod to &quot;piracy&quot;, Alan Wake will gain a black eyepatch over his right eye, complete with a miniature Jolly Roger.
* While the copy protection in &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot; was not hidden as such, the repercussions of missing the codes was unusual: the player ended up in jail (permanently), and the police officer gave a lengthy and condescending speech about software copying.
* In case of copied versions of &quot;The Settlers III&quot;, the iron smelters only produced pigs (a play on pig iron); weaponsmiths require iron to produce weapons, so players could not amass arms.
* Bohemia Interactive developed a unique and very subtle protection system for its game &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis&quot;. Dubbed FADE, if it detects an unauthorized copy, it does not inform the player immediately but instead progressively corrupts aspects of the game (such as reducing the weapon accuracy to zero) to the point that it eventually becomes unplayable. The message &quot;Original discs don&#x27;t FADE&quot; will eventually appear if the game is detected as being an unauthorized copy.
** FADE is also used in &quot;ArmA II&quot;, and will similarly diminish the accuracy of the player&#x27;s weapons, as well as induce a &quot;drunken vision&quot; effect, where the screen becomes wavy, should the player be playing on an unauthorized copy.
** This system was also used in &quot;Take On Helicopters&quot;, where the screen blurred and distorted when playing a counterfeit copy, making it hard to safely pilot a helicopter.
** The &quot;IndyCar Series&quot; also utilizes FADE technology to safeguard against piracy by making races very difficult to win on a pirated version. The penultimate section of the game&#x27;s manual states:

* &quot;&quot; contained a code that disabled Batman&#x27;s glider cape, making some areas of the game very difficult to complete and a certain achievement/trophy impossible to unlock (gliding continuously for over 100m).
* The PC version of &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; has a copy protection that swings the camera as though the player was drunk. If the player enters a car and motorcycle or boat it will automatically throttle, making it difficult to steer. It also damages the vehicle, making it vulnerable to collisions and bullets. An update to the game prevented unauthorised copies from accessing the in-game web browser, making it impossible to finish the game as some missions involve browsing the web for objectives.
* &quot;EarthBound&quot; is well-documented for its extensive use of checksums to ensure that the game is being played on legitimate hardware. If the game detects that it is being played on a European SNES, it refuses to boot, as the first of several checksums has failed. A second checksum will weed out most unauthorized copies of the game, but hacking the data to get past this checksum will trigger a third checksum that makes enemy encounters appear much more often than in an authorized copy, and if the player progresses through the game without giving up (or cracks this protection), a final checksum code will activate before the final boss battle, freezing the game and deleting all the save files. A similar copy protection system was used in &quot;&quot;, although it only uses one copy protection check at the beginning of the game (see below).
* In an unauthorized version of the PC edition of &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, the game save mechanism did not work and the in-game galactic map caused the game to crash. As the galactic map is needed to travel to different sections of the game, the player became stuck in the first section of the game.
* If an unauthorized version of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; was used, the Build Mode would not work properly. Walls could not be built on the player&#x27;s property, which prevented the player from building any custom houses. Some furniture and clothing selections would not be available either.
* A March 2009 update to the BeeJive IM iPhone app included special functionality for users of the unauthorized version: the screen would read &quot;PC LOAD LETTER&quot; whenever the user tried to establish a connection to any IM service, then quickly switch to a YouTube clip from the movie &quot;Office Space&quot;.
* &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; and have a copy protection system that completely wipes out the player&#x27;s forces briefly after a battle begins on an unlicensed copy. However, some who purchased the latter have encountered a bug that caused this copy protection scheme to trigger when it was not supposed to.
* If a player pirated the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Michael Jackson: The Experience&quot;, vuvuzela noises will play over the notes during a song, which then become invisible. The game will also freeze if the player tries to pause it.
* Older versions of Autodesk 3ds Max use a dongle for copy protection; if it is missing, the program will randomly corrupt the points of the user&#x27;s model during usage, destroying their work.
* Older versions of CDRWIN used a serial number for initial copy protection. However, if this check was bypassed, a second hidden check would activate causing a random factor to be introduced into the CD burning process, producing corrupted &quot;coaster&quot; disks.
* Terminate, a BBS terminal package, would appear to operate normally if cracked but would insert a warning that a pirated copy was in use into the IEMSI login packet it transmitted, where the sysop of any BBS the user called could clearly read it.
* &quot;Ubik&#x27;s Musik&quot;, a music creation tool for the Commodore 64, would transform into a &quot;Space Invaders&quot; game if it detected that a cartridge-based copying device had attempted to interrupt it. This copy protection system also doubles as an Easter egg, as the message that appears when it occurs is not hostile (&quot;Plug joystick in port 1, press fire, and no more resetting/experting!&quot;).
* The Amiga version of &quot;Bomberman&quot; featured a multitap peripheral that also acted as a dongle. Data from the multitap was used to calculate the time limit of each level. If the multitap was missing, the time limit would be calculated as 0, causing the level to end immediately.
* &quot;Nevermind&quot;, a puzzle game for the Amiga, contained code that caused an unlicensed version of the game to behave as a demo. The game would play three levels sampled from throughout the game, and then give the message &quot;You have completed three levels; however there are 100 levels to complete on the original disc.&quot;
* In &quot;&quot;, a character named Zoe will tell the player outside the room containing the balloon to Midday Garden Home and several other areas that the player is using an unlicensed copy. This conversation purposely corrupts data. When corrupted, the game would not only remove stray gems and the ability to progress in certain areas but also make the final boss unbeatable, returning the player to the beginning of the game (and removing the save file at the same time) after about 8 seconds into the battle.
* The Atari Jaguar console would freeze at startup and play the sound of an enraged jaguar snarling if the inserted cartridge failed the initial security check.
* The Lenslok copy protection system gave an obvious message if the lens-coded letters were entered incorrectly, but if the user soft-reset the machine, the areas of memory occupied by the game would be flooded with the message &quot;THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN OUR PRODUCT. NICE TRY. LOVE BJ/NJ&quot; to prevent the user examining leftover code to crack the protection.
* An update to the sandbox game &quot;Garry&#x27;s Mod&quot; enabled a copy protection mechanism that outputs the error &quot;Unable to shade polygon normals&quot; if the game detects that it has been copied. The error also includes the user&#x27;s Steam ID as an error ID, meaning that users can be identified by their Steam account when asking for help about the error over the Internet.
* The Atari version of &quot;Alternate Reality: The Dungeon&quot; would have the player&#x27;s character attacked by two unbeatable &quot;FBI Agents&quot; if it detected a cracked version. The FBI agents would also appear when restoring a save which was created by such a version, even if the version restoring the save was legal.
* &quot;VGA Planets&quot;, a play-by-BBS strategy game, contained code in its server which would check all clients&#x27; submitted turns for suspect registration codes. Any player deemed to be using a cracked copy, or cheating in the game, would have random forces destroyed throughout the game by an unbeatable enemy called &quot;The Tim Continuum&quot; (after the game&#x27;s author, Tim Wissemann). A similar commercial game, &quot;Stars!&quot;, would issue empty turn updates for players with invalid registration codes, meaning that none of their orders would ever be carried out.
* On a copied version of the original PC version of &quot;Postal&quot;, as soon as the game was started, the player character would immediately shoot himself in the head.
* In &quot;Serious Sam 3: BFE&quot;, if the game code detects what it believes to be an unauthorized copy, an invincible scorpion-like monster is spawned in the beginning of the game with high speeds, melee attacks, and attacks from a range with twin chainguns making the game extremely difficult and preventing the player from progressing further. Also in the level &quot;Under the Iron Cloud&quot;, the player&#x27;s character will spin out-of-control looking up in the air.
* An unauthorized copy of &quot;Pokémon Black and White&quot; and their sequels will run as if it were normal, but the Pokémon will not gain any experience points after a battle. This has since been solved by patching the game&#x27;s files.
* If &quot;Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor&#x27;s Gambit&quot; detects an illegitimate or downloaded copy of the game, it will convert the entire game&#x27;s text into the game&#x27;s symbol based foreign language, Borginian, which cannot be translated in any way.
* The unlicensed version of indie game &quot;Game Dev Tycoon&quot;, in which the player runs a game development company, will dramatically increase the piracy rate of the games the player releases to the point where no money can be made at all, and disable the player&#x27;s ability to take any action against it 
* In the stand-alone expansion to Crytek&#x27;s &quot;Crysis&quot;, &quot;Crysis Warhead&quot;, players who pirated the game will have their ammunition replaced with chickens that inflict no damage and have very little knockback, rendering ranged combat impossible.
* In Crytek&#x27;s &quot;Crysis 3&quot;, if a player used an unlicensed copy of the game, he is not able to defeat the last boss (The Alpha Ceph), thus making it impossible to beat the game.
* In &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;, copy protection will prevent its player character, Faith, from sprinting, making it impossible for players to jump over long gaps and progress further on a pirated copy.
*In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks&quot; if the player is playing a pirated copy of the game it will remove the train control UI if it detects that it has been pirated, which effectively stonewalls the player at the train&#x27;s tutorial section very early on and thus making the game unbeatable.

The usage of copy protection payloads which lower playability of a game without making it clear that this is a result of copy protection is now generally considered unwise, due to the potential for it to result in unaware players with unlicensed copies spreading word-of-mouth that a game is of low quality. The authors of FADE explicitly acknowledged this as a reason for including the explicit warning message.

== Anti-piracy ==

Anti-piracy measures are efforts to fight against copyright infringement, counterfeiting, and other violations of intellectual property laws.

It includes, but is by no means limited to, the combined efforts of corporate associations (such as the RIAA and MPA), law enforcement agencies (such as the FBI and Interpol), and various international governments to combat copyright infringement relating to various types of creative works, such as software, music and films. These measures often come in the form of copy protection measures such as DRM, or measures implemented through a content protection network, such as Distil Networks or Incapsula. Richard Stallman and the GNU Project have criticized the use of the word &quot;piracy&quot; in these situations, saying that publishers use the word to refer to &quot;copying they don&#x27;t approve of&quot; and that &quot;they [publishers] imply that it is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them&quot;. 
Certain forms of anti-piracy (such as DRM) are considered by consumers to control the use of the products content after sale.

In the case &quot;MPAA v. Hotfile&quot;, Judge Kathleen M. Williams granted a motion to deny the prosecution the usage of words she views as &quot;pejorative&quot;. This list included the word &quot;piracy&quot;, the use of which, the motion by the defense stated, would serve no purpose but to misguide and inflame the jury. The plaintiff argued the common use of the terms when referring to copyright infringement should invalidate the motion, but the Judge did not concur.

=== Anti-piracy in file sharing ===
Today, copyright infringement is often facilitated by the use of file sharing. In fact, infringement accounts for 23.8% of all internet traffic in 2013. In an effort to cut down on this, both large and small films and music corporations have issued DMCA takedown notices, filed lawsuits, and pressed criminal prosecution of those who host these file sharing services.

== Anti-counterfeiting and gun control ==
The EURion constellation is used by many countries to prevent color photocopiers from producing counterfeit currency. The Counterfeit Deterrence System is used to prevent counterfeit bills from being produced by image editing software. Similar technology has been proposed to prevent 3D printing of firearms, for reasons of gun control rather than copyright.

<doc id="219211" wikidata="Q4956667" url="?curid=219211" title="Brandenburg v. Ohio">
<text>Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), is a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is &quot;directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action&quot;. Specifically, the Court struck down Ohio&#x27;s criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence. In the process, &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927) was explicitly overruled, and &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (1919), &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; (1919), &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot; (1925), and &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1951) were overturned.

==Background==
Clarence Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) leader in rural Ohio, contacted a reporter at a Cincinnati television station and invited him to cover a KKK rally that would take place in Hamilton County in the summer of 1964. Portions of the rally were filmed, showing several men in robes and hoods, some carrying firearms, first burning a cross and then making speeches. One of the speeches made reference to the possibility of &quot;revengeance&quot; against &quot;Niggers&quot;, &quot;Jews&quot;, and those who supported them and also claimed that &quot;our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race&quot;, and announced plans for a march on Congress to take place on the Fourth of July. Another speech advocated for the forced expulsion of African Americans to Africa and Jewish Americans to Israel.

Brandenburg was charged with advocating violence under Ohio&#x27;s criminal syndicalism statute for his participation in the rally and for the speech he made. In relevant part, the statute – enacted in 1919 during the First Red Scare – proscribed &quot;advocat[ing] ... the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform&quot; and &quot;voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society, group or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism&quot;.

Convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Brandenburg was fined $1,000 and sentenced to one to ten years in prison. On appeal, the Ohio First District Court of Appeal affirmed Brandenburg&#x27;s conviction, rejecting his claim that the statute violated his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal without opinion.

Although &quot;Yates v. United States&quot; (1957) had overturned the convictions of mid-level Communist Party members in language that seemed suggestive of a broader view of freedom of expression rights than had been accorded them in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1951), all &quot;Yates&quot; purported to do was a federal statute, the 1940 Smith Act. Thus, &quot;Dennis&quot; reading of the First Amendment remained in force: advocacy of law violation, even as an abstract doctrine, could be punished under law consistent with the free speech clause.

==Decision==
The U.S. Supreme Court reversed Brandenburg&#x27;s conviction, holding that government cannot constitutionally punish abstract advocacy of force or law violation. The majority opinion was &quot;per curiam&quot;, issued from the Court as an institution, rather than as authored and signed by an individual justice. The earlier draft had originally been prepared by Justice Abe Fortas before he was forced to resign in the midst of an ethics scandal, and it would have included a modified version of the clear and present danger test. In finalizing the draft, Justice Brennan eliminated all references to it by substituting the &quot;imminent lawless action&quot; language. Justices Black and Douglas concurred separately.

===&quot;Per curiam&quot; opinion===
The &quot;per curiam&quot; majority opinion struck down the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute, overruled &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927), and articulated a new test – the &quot;imminent lawless action&quot; test – for judging what was then referred to as &quot;seditious speech&quot; under the First Amendment:
In &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (1919) the Court had adopted a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test that &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927) subsequently expanded to a &quot;bad tendency&quot; test: if speech has a &quot;tendency&quot; to cause sedition or lawlessness, it may constitutionally be prohibited. &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1951), a case dealing with prosecution of alleged Communists under the Smith Act for advocating the overthrow of the government, used the clear and present danger test while still upholding the defendants&#x27; convictions for acts that could not possibly have led to a speedy overthrow of the government.

The &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion cited &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; (1951) as though it were good law and amenable to the result reached in &quot;Brandenburg&quot;. However, &quot;Brandenburg&quot; completely did away with &quot;Dennis&quot; central holding and held that &quot;mere advocacy&quot; of any doctrine, including one that assumed the necessity of violence or law violation, was &quot;per se&quot; protected speech. It may be that principles of &quot;stare decisis&quot; figured in the Court&#x27;s decision to avoid overruling the relatively recent &quot;Dennis&quot;, but the distance between the two cases&#x27; approach is obvious and irreconcilable.

====&quot;Brandenburg&quot; test (&quot;imminent lawless action&quot; test)====
The three distinct elements of this test (intent to speak, imminence of lawlessness, and likelihood of lawlessness) have distinct precedential lineages.

Judge Learned Hand was possibly the first judge to advocate the intent standard, in &quot;Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten&quot; (1917), reasoning that &quot;[i]f one stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or their interest to resist the law, it seems to me one should not be held to have attempted to cause its violation&quot;. However, the &quot;Brandenburg&quot; intent standard is more speech-protective than Hand&#x27;s formulation, which contained no temporal element of imminence.

The imminence element was a departure from earlier rulings. &quot;Brandenburg&quot; did not explicitly overrule the bad tendency test, but it appears that after &quot;Brandenburg&quot;, the test is de facto overruled. The &quot;Brandenburg&quot; test effectively made the time element of the clear and present danger test more defined and more rigorous. Applying the &quot;Brandenburg&quot; test in &quot;Hess v. Indiana&quot; (1973) the Supreme Court held that the prerequisite for speech which is not protected by the First Amendment is that the speech in question must lead to “imminent disorder”.

===Concurrences===
Justice Hugo Black, renowned civil libertarian and First Amendment absolutist, filed a short concurrence indicating his agreement with Justice William O. Douglas&#x27;s longer opinion and pointing out that the &quot;per curiam&quot;″s reliance on &quot;Dennis&quot; was more symbolic than actual.

Justice Douglas&#x27;s concurrence reflected the absolutist position that only he and Black, among Supreme Court justices, ever fully subscribed to, namely that the phrase &quot;no law&quot; in the First Amendment ought to be interpreted very literally, and that all speech is immune from prosecution, regardless of the governmental interests advanced in suppressing some particular instance of speech. He briefly traced the history of the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test, illustrating how it had been used over the years since its debut in &quot;Schenck&quot; to dismiss dozens of what Douglas viewed as legitimate First Amendment claims.

A short section of Douglas&#x27;s opinion indicated that he might be open to allowing the government greater latitude in controlling speech during time of &quot;declared war&quot; (making clear that he was not referring to the then-current Vietnam War), although he only phrased that possibility in terms of doubt (as opposed to his certainty that the clear and present danger test was irreconcilable with the First Amendment during time of peace).

Douglas also argued for the legitimate role of symbolic speech in First Amendment doctrine, using examples of a person ripping up a Bible to celebrate the abandonment of his faith or tearing a copy of the Constitution in order to protest a Supreme Court decision, and assailed the previous term&#x27;s &quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot;, which had allowed for the prosecution of a man for burning his draft card. In all these situations, Douglas argued, an action was a vital way of conveying a certain message, and thus the action itself deserved First Amendment protection.

Finally, Douglas dealt with the classic example of a man &quot;&quot;falsely&quot; shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic&quot;. In order to explain why someone could be legitimately prosecuted for this, Douglas called it &quot;a classic case where speech is brigaded with action&quot;. In the view of Douglas and Black, this was probably the only sort of case in which a person could be prosecuted for speech.

==Subsequent developments==
The &quot;Brandenburg&quot; test was the Supreme Court&#x27;s last major statement on what government may do about inflammatory speech that seeks to incite others to lawless action. It resolved the debate between those who urged greater government control of speech for reasons of security and those who favored allowing as much speech as possible and relying on the marketplace of ideas to reach a favorable result, leaving the law in a state along the lines of that which Justices Louis Brandeis, and, post-&quot;Schenck&quot;, Oliver Wendell Holmes advocated in several dissents and concurrences during the late 1910s and early 1920s.

The &quot;Brandenburg&quot; test remains the standard used for evaluating attempts by the government to punish inflammatory speech, and it has not been seriously challenged since it was laid down in 1969. Very few cases have actually reached the Court during the past decades that would test the outer limits of &quot;Brandenburg&quot;. The most significant application of &quot;Brandenburg&quot; came four years after in &quot;Hess v. Indiana&quot;. 

&quot;Brandenburg&quot; has received praise by legal scholars for establishing this framework. Gerald Gunther, a prominent constitutional law scholar, proclaimed the decision as the &quot;clearest and most protective standard under the first amendment.&quot; Additionally, American jurist Harry Kalven, Jr., suggested that, with &quot;Brandenburg&quot;, the First Amendment &quot;may finally have worked itself pure.&quot;

&quot;Brandenburg&quot; has come under criticism in the twenty-first century. Lyrissa Lidsky, a scholar of the law, stated that &quot;&quot;Brandenburg&quot;&quot;&#x27;s&quot; sanguine attitude toward the prospect of violence rests on an assumption about the audiences of radical speech. &quot;Brandenburg&quot; assumes that most citizens ... simply are not susceptible to impassioned calls to violent action by radical speakers.&quot; It has also become more common for lower federal courts to apply the test loosely, especially in circumstances related to online terrorist recruitment.

<doc id="219217" wikidata="Q25186" url="?curid=219217" title="Gus Van Sant">
<text>Gus Green Van Sant Jr. (born July 24, 1952) is an American filmmaker, photographer, painter, and musician who has earned acclaim as an independent auteur. His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures.

His early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest. He made his feature-length directorial debut film &quot;Mala Noche&quot; (1985). He earned acclaim for a string of independent films such as the crime drama &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; (1989), the adventure film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991), and the black comedy &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995). He earned two Academy Award for Best Director nominations for the drama &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), and the biographical film &quot;Milk&quot; (2008), both of which also received Best Picture nominations. 

Van Sant directed the psychological drama &quot;Elephant&quot; (2003), a film based on the Columbine High School massacre, for which he won the Palme d&#x27;Or and Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. 
Van Sant&#x27;s creative output has since been mixed. He received positive reviews for &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; (2000), &quot;Paranoid Park&quot; (2007), &quot;Promised Land&quot; (2012), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, He Won&#x27;t Get Far on Foot&quot; (2018) while receiving negative receptions for his films &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; (1993), &quot;Psycho&quot; (1998), &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Sea of Trees&quot; (2015).

Also known for his work on television, he has directed and executive produced the political drama series &quot;Boss&quot; (2011), the docudrama miniseries &quot;When We Rise&quot; (2018), and the anthology series &quot;&quot; (2024). Van Sant has written screenplays for several of his earlier works, and has also published the novel, &quot;Pink&quot;, and a book of his photography, &quot;108 Portraits&quot;, He has also released two musical albums.

== Early life and education ==
Van Sant was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Betty (née Seay) and Gus Green Van Sant Sr. The younger Gus&#x27; father was a clothing manufacturer and traveling salesman, who rapidly worked his way into middle class prosperity, holding executive marketing positions that included being president of the White Stag Manufacturing Company&#x27;s apparel operation. As a result of his father&#x27;s job, the family moved continually during his childhood.

Gus Van Sant&#x27;s paternal family is of partial Dutch origin; the name &quot;Van Sant&quot; is derived from the Dutch name &quot;&quot;Van Zandt&quot;&quot;. The earliest Van Zandt arrived in the New Netherland area in the early 17th century, around what is now New York City.

Van Sant is an alumnus of Darien High School in Darien, Connecticut, and The Catlin Gabel School in Portland, Oregon. One constant in the director&#x27;s early years was his interest in visual arts (namely, painting and Super-8 filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant&#x27;s artistic leanings took him to the Rhode Island School of Design in 1970, where his introduction to various avant-garde directors inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.

==Career==
===1982–1989: Early career===

After spending time in Europe, Van Sant went to Los Angeles in 1976. He secured a job as a production assistant to filmmaker Ken Shapiro, with whom he developed a few ideas, none of which came to fruition. In 1981, Van Sant made &quot;Alice in Hollywood&quot;, a film about a naïve young actress who goes to Hollywood and abandons her ideals. It was never released. During this period, Van Sant began to spend time observing the denizens of the more down-and-out sections of Hollywood Boulevard. He became fascinated by the existence of this marginalized section of L.A.&#x27;s population, especially in context with the more ordinary, prosperous world that surrounded them. Van Sant would repeatedly focus his work on those existing on society&#x27;s fringes, making his feature film directorial debut &quot;Mala Noche&quot;.

It was made two years after Van Sant went to New York to work in an advertising agency. He saved $20,000 during his tenure there, enabling him to finance the majority of his tale of doomed love between a gay liquor store clerk and a Mexican immigrant. The film, which was taken from Portland street writer Walt Curtis&#x27; semi-autobiographical novella, featured some of the director&#x27;s hallmarks, notably an unfulfilled romanticism, a dry sense of the absurd, and the refusal to treat homosexuality as something deserving of judgment. Unlike many gay filmmakers, Van Sant—who had long been openly gay—declined to use same-sex relationships as fodder for overtly political statements, although such relationships would frequently appear in his films.

Shot in black-and-white, the film earned Van Sant almost overnight acclaim on the festival circuit, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; naming it the year&#x27;s best independent film. The film&#x27;s success attracted Hollywood interest, and Van Sant was briefly courted by Universal; the courtship ended after Van Sant pitched a series of project ideas (including what would become &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; and &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;) that the studio declined to take interest in.

Van Sant returned to Portland, Oregon, where he set up house and began giving life to the ideas rejected by Universal. He directed &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; about four drug addicts robbing pharmacies to support their habit. The film met with great critical success and revived the career of Matt Dillon.

===1990–1995: Indie and arthouse success===
&quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;&#x27;s exploration of the lives of those living on society&#x27;s outer fringes, as well as its Portland setting, were mirrored in Van Sant&#x27;s next effort, the similarly acclaimed &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991). Only with the success of &quot;Cowboy&quot; was Van Sant now given license to make &quot;Idaho&quot; (a film he had originally pitched that was knocked back several times because the studios deemed the script &#x27;too risky&#x27;). New Line Cinema now gave Van Sant the green light, and he went on a mission to get the &quot;Idaho&quot; script into the hands of River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, his preferred choice for the two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured Phoenix and Reeves, who played the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor, respectively.

Centering on the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an Independent Spirit Award for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the Venice Film Festival among others. It helped Reeves—previously best known for his work in the &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; movies—to get the critical respect that had eluded him.

Van Sant&#x27;s next film, a 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins&#x27; &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of $8.5 million and a large, eclectic cast including Uma Thurman, John Hurt, Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix&#x27;s younger sister Rain (at Phoenix&#x27;s suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster.

Van Sant&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;To Die For&quot; helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of Joyce Maynard&#x27;s novel, the black comedy starred Nicole Kidman as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars Matt Dillon as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, Joaquin Phoenix, as her equally hapless lover (River had died of a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant&#x27;s first effort for a major studio (Columbia), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director&#x27;s choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for Larry Clark&#x27;s &quot;Kids&quot;; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film&#x27;s subject matter and the fact that Clark&#x27;s photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;.

===1997–2003: Mainstream breakout===
In 1997, Van Sant gained mainstream recognition and critical acclaim thanks to &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The film, about a troubled, blue-collar mathematical genius, was a huge critical and commercial success. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Director for Van Sant. It won two, including Best Screenplay for Damon and Affleck, and Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams, who, in his acceptance speech, referred to Van Sant as &quot;being so subtle you&#x27;re almost subliminal.&quot; Van Sant, Damon and Affleck parodied themselves and the film&#x27;s success in Kevin Smith&#x27;s&quot; Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.&quot;

Van Sant received the opportunity to remake Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s classic &quot;Psycho&quot;. As opposed to reinterpreting the 1960 film, Van Sant opted to recreate the film shot-for-shot, in color, with a cast of young Hollywood A-listers. His decision was met with equal parts curiosity, skepticism, and derision from industry insiders and outsiders alike, and the finished result met with a similar reception. It starred Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn and Julianne Moore, and met with a negative critical reception and did poorly at the box office.

In 2000, Van Sant directed &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;, about a high-school student (Rob Brown) from the Bronx unlikely becoming a friend of a crusty, reclusive author (Sean Connery). Critical response was generally positive and became a box office success. In addition to directing, he devoted considerable energy to releasing two albums and publishing a novel, &quot;Pink&quot;, which was a thinly veiled exploration of his grief over River Phoenix&#x27;s death.

===2003–present: Return to arthouse cinema===

Van Sant traveled to the deserts of Argentina, Utah, and Death Valley for the production of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Gerry&quot;, a loosely devised, largely improvised feature in which stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck—both playing characters named Gerry—wander through the desert, discussing &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, video games, and nothing in particular. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

It took &quot;Gerry&quot; over a year to make it to theaters, in which time Van Sant began production on his next film, &quot;Elephant&quot;. Approached by HBO and producer Diane Keaton to craft a fictional film based on the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, the director chose to shoot in his hometown of Portland, employing dozens of untrained, teen actors. Melding improvisational long takes like those in &quot;Gerry&quot; with Harris Savides&#x27; fluid camerawork, the film was influenced by Alan Clarke&#x27;s 1989 film of the same name (see &quot;Elephant&quot;). The finished film provoked strong reactions from audiences at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. At the Cannes festival, the jury awarded &quot;Elephant&quot; with their top prize, the Palme d&#x27;Or, and Van Sant with his first Best Director statue from the festival.

In 2005, Van Sant released &quot;Last Days&quot;, the final component of what he refers to as his &quot;Death Trilogy&quot;, (the other parts being &quot;Gerry&quot; and &quot;Elephant&quot;). It is a fictionalized account of what happened to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in the days leading up to his death. In 2006, Van Sant began work on &quot;Paranoid Park&quot; based on the book by Blake Nelson, about a skateboarding teenager who accidentally causes someone&#x27;s death. The film was released in Europe in February 2008. He also directed the &quot;Le Marais&quot; segment of the omnibus film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot;.

Released in 2008, Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Milk&quot; is a biopic of openly gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. The film received eight Oscar nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning two for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Sean Penn, who starred as Milk, and Best Original Screenplay for writer Dustin Lance Black. Van Sant was nominated for Best Director. Van Sant later stated that his experience with Sean Penn on the film was &quot;amazing&quot;. His 2011 film &quot;Restless&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, and starred Henry Hopper and Mia Wasikowska.

Van Sant&#x27;s film, &quot;Promised Land&quot;, was released on December 28, 2012. The film stars Frances McDormand, Matt Damon, and John Krasinski—the latter two co-wrote the screenplay based on a story by Dave Eggers. Filmed in April 2012, the production company, Focus Features, selected the release date so that the film is eligible to qualify for awards consideration. After &quot;Promised Land&quot;, Van Sant directed a film titled &quot;Sea of Trees&quot;, which starred Matthew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe. The film tells the story of a man who travels to the infamous Aokigahara suicide forest in Japan to kill himself, only to encounter another man wishing to kill himself as well, with whom he then embarks on a &quot;spiritual journey&quot;. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival but was met with harsh critical reception at the Cannes, being booed and laughed at.

In December 2016, it was announced Van Sant would direct &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, He Won&#x27;t Get Far on Foot&quot;, a biopic about cartoonist John Callahan, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Jonah Hill, Jack Black, and Mark Webber. Principal photography began in March 2017.

In December 2024, he was reported to be directing &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Wire&quot; starring Bill Skarsgard and Dacre Montgomery, and produced by Elevated Films and Balcony 9 Productions.

===Other work===
Van Sant released two musical albums: &quot;Gus Van Sant&quot; and &quot;18 Songs About Golf&quot;. Van Sant played himself in episodes of the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot; and the IFC series &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

Van Sant was credited for all photography, paintings and art direction on the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, and directed the video for &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;. He directed the pilot for the Starz television program &quot;Boss&quot;, starring Kelsey Grammer. Van Sant went onto &quot;The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast&quot; in 2014 to discuss filmmaking, writing, film history and their collaborations that never got made (&quot;The Golden Suicides&quot;) and the one that did (&quot;The Canyons&quot;).

== Personal life == 
He lives in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="219218" wikidata="Q4804706" url="?curid=219218" title="Ashby Canal">
<text>The Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal is a long canal in England which connected the mining district around Moira, just outside the town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, with the Coventry Canal at Bedworth in Warwickshire. It was opened in 1804, and a number of tramways were constructed at its northern end, to service collieries. The canal was taken over by the Midland Railway in 1846, but remained profitable until the 1890s, after which it steadily declined. Around passed through the Leicestershire coal field, and was heavily affected by subsidence, with the result that this section from Moira, southwards to Snarestone, was progressively closed in 1944, 1957 and 1966, leaving of navigable canal.

The abandoned section is the subject of a restoration project and was the first canal where a new section had been authorised under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The Transport and Works Order was obtained by Leicestershire County Council, as some of the original route had been infilled and built over, and restoration therefore involved construction on a new route through the centre of Measham. It is hoped that all but the final section of the canal can be re-opened. An isolated section near Moira Furnace and the National Forest visitor centre was opened between 1999 and 2005, and is the location for an annual trailboat festival.

==Route==

The canal starts at a junction with the Coventry Canal just outside Bedworth and travels north-east for about 7 miles (11 km) through the town of Hinckley. It then continues to run north through largely rural and remote countryside for another 15 miles (24 km) until reaching its terminus at Snarestone. Near Sutton Cheney Wharf, it passes the foot of Ambion Hill, the site of the Battle of Bosworth Field. At Shackerstone, it passes the station that is the headquarters of the Battlefield Line Railway.

==History==

===Origins===
In the last half of the 18th century there had been an increasing need for transport to exploit the coal reserves at Ashby Wolds and lime from the quarries north of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The first proposal was for a canal running from Burton-on-Trent on the upper River Trent to Marston on the Coventry Canal. A second suggestion was for a canal from Ashby Wolds to the Coventry Canal at Griff. Both proposals were made in December 1781. The first was opposed by the Coventry company, though the second was not. Robert Whitworth had estimated the cost of the project at £46,396, but the scheme was dropped a year later. William Jessop proposed a canal and tramway between Breedon and the Trent, with a connecting link to the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1787, which also came to nothing. A proposal in 1790 was well received at the time, but opposition afterwards prevented a bill being submitted to Parliament. Another proposal for a canal northwards to the Trent at Burton was actively discussed between 1791 and 1793. There was wide support for a canal to Griff in 1792, but the muted support of Penn Assheton Curzon, a local landowner and Member of Parliament, led to it being dropped.
In October 1792, Robert Whitworth revised his plan from 1781. The proposal featured a level canal from Griff, near Nuneaton, to Ashby Wolds, which would cost £63,402. From there it would climb to a summit which would be supplied with water by a steam pumping engine. After a further , the summit level would descend through to level branches, which would serve collieries at Ticknall, Coleorton, Cloud Hill, near Breedon-on-the-Hill, and Staunton Harold. The cost of this section would be £82,143. The plans were checked by Jessop, and formed the basis for a bill to authorise a company with powers to raise £150,000 of capital. Hard negotiation with Curzon and the Coventry Canal was required, during which the junction with the Coventry Canal was moved from Griff to Marston, but the bill finally became an act of Parliament, the (34 Geo. 3. c. 93), in May 1794. Whitworth and his son, also called Robert, were appointed as engineers in July, and construction began. (Robert Whitworth was later remembered with the naming in 2002 of Whitworth Avenue on the new George Wimpey development in Hinckley, which overlooks the Ashby Canal).

===Construction===
By October 1796, it had become obvious that the costs of construction had been seriously underestimated. In addition, around one quarter of the shareholders had not honoured their pledges, and so the company had less capital than expected. The company decided that the only solution was to replace the branch canals with tramways. For a brief time at the start of 1797, the company investigated the possibility of extending the canal to the River Trent at Burton-on-Trent, and building tramways from the quarries to the river. Amalgamation with the Trent Navigation was considered, but the plans failed due to the lack of capital. In May 1797, Robert Whitworth Jr. became ill, and the Whitworths were replaced by Thomas Newbold. An investigation at that time into the state of the collieries at Ashby Wolds revealed that they were unlikely to be producing coal by the time the canal opened. By March the following year, the top section from Ashby Wolds to Market Bosworth was operational.

The company had been considering the option of building tramways since 1793, and finally asked Newbold to investigate the possible lines for railways which would serve the canal at Ashby Wolds in June 1798. They then asked Benjamin Outram to advise, and he reported in September. He suggested running the lines to Willesley Basin rather than Ashby Wolds, as this route would cost over £8,000 less. The lines as built ran from the basin through Ashby to a junction at Old Parks, where one branch ran through Lount to Cloud Hill, replacing the proposed canal and its diversion through Coleorton. The other branch led from Old Parks to Ticknall, with branches to the quarries between Calke Abbey and Staunton Harold. The total length of the lines was around .

In 1799, Outram had discussions with the company about the gauge of the tramways, and although lines at Crich and for the Derby Canal used a gauge of , he recommended that it should be made wider, at , forecasting that, within a few years, railways would be the principal mode of transport for merchandise. The wider gauge would increase the cost of tunnels and bridges, but only by £785 on a final contract price of £29,500. His quotation was accepted, although repeated requests by Outram for his contract to be signed were ignored.

Outram&#x27;s engineer for the line was John Hodgkinson who was experienced in the work, but problems arose because the committee insisted that it should proceed on all sections of the line simultaneously, which made supervision difficult. Moreover, perennially short of money, they were dilatory in making decisions and providing funds, which caused Outram problems at his Butterley Works as he was having to refuse contracts, so that he could be ready to provide the canal with material, as and when it was authorised. During this period of delay, the labour costs and the price of iron also rose. Even though Outram&#x27;s experience of his treatment by the canal proprietors must have spoilt his satisfaction on the completion of the lines, they were arguably a major achievement and a model for railways in the future.

===Later history===

The tramways were completed towards the end of 1802, and the level section of the canal from Marston to Moira was opened on 19 April 1804. The only lock was a stop lock at Marston, to protect the water supplies. By this time, the finances were not in good shape, as failures of the shareholders to honour calls on the shares had resulted in the company borrowing £21,539 to complete the work, and the mines were still not producing coal at a rate which would have made the canal profitable. The final cost of construction was around £184,070. The main source of traffic was from the pits at Moira, which steadily expanded, particularly in the 1820s, enabling the loans to be paid off between 1820 and 1827, and the first dividend to be paid in 1828. In 1819, the company and the Coventry Canal agreed to convert the stop lock between the canals so that it was only suitable for narrow boats, and they shared the cost of conversion. The reasons for this are unclear, since wide-beamed boats continued to operate on the canal, but could not move further afield. Profitability was improved after the company sent Crossley, their engineer, on a fact-finding tour of local canals in 1822. He investigated tolls for coal, and the system of drawbacks which some of them used. Such a system was them implemented on the Ashby, whereby coal travelling the whole length of the canal was subject to a refund or drawback on the tolls. The effect was immediate, with the amount of coal qualifying for the drawback rising five-fold between 1824 and 1828, from 4,367 to 22,011 tons, and reaching 37,316 tons in 1837.

In 1823, there were calls for tramways to be built from the head of the canal to Swadlincote and Church Gresley. It took the committee two and a half years to decide to proceed, and the Swadlincote Railway was opened on 21 July 1827. It was built with double tracks, and used edge rails, similar to modern railways, rather than the L-shaped tram plates of the Willesley system. The cost of £4,262 was financed by a mortgage, which was paid off less than a year after opening. The Ticknall branch was extended in 1829, when a line from it to Dimsdale was authorised and built. The Coleorton Railway, which was run by an independent company, and used edge rails, opened in 1833. Negotiations between the two companies resulted in a connecting line being built between Cloud Hill and Worthington Rough, which used a type of rail called a &quot;rib rail&quot;, where the vertical flange of Outram&#x27;s L-shaped rail was made much wider, so that wagons with flanged wheels could use it as an edge rail. The Ashby engineer was asked to prepare a quotation for the conversion of the entire Willesley system to rib rails in 1837, but there is no record as to whether this work was carried out.

===Railway ownership===
In 1845, the Midland Railway were planning to build the Atherstone, Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Burton-on-Trent railway, and offered to buy the canal for £110,000. They agreed to maintain the canal until the railway was built, but there was no longer-term agreement on its future. Since most of the coal which used the canal travelled onwards via the Coventry Canal and the Oxford Canal, these companies faced a big drop in toll revenues, and fought hard to get the Midland Railway&#x27;s bill amended. As well as a commitment to maintaining the canal, they also had a clause added which allowed the Coventry Canal to undertake maintenance and charge the railway for the work if the railway company failed in their obligations. An act of Parliament, the Midland Railway (No. 2) Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cciii) was passed, which authorised the takeover, but the railway line as envisioned was not built. It was nearly 30 years later that serious railway competition arrived, when the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway jointly opened the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway from Overseal to Nuneaton in 1873. The following year, the Midland reused the section of tramway from Ashby to Worthington, Leicestershire, enlarging the Old Parks tunnel, as part of a line that ran through Melbourne to Derby. The remainder of the tramway lines were kept for local use, with the branch to Ticknall closing in 1915.

The canal continued to carry significant tonnages, which gradually decreased, from 138,117 tons in 1862 to 113,659 tons in 1882. After that, the decline was more rapid, dropping to 33,329 tons by 1893. By the 1890s, the railway owners had reduced maintenance on the canal, knowing that the Coventry Canal were unlikely to invoke their powers under the Midland Railway (No. 2) Act 1846, since they too were in trouble. On 2 January 1918, there was a major breach in the canal when an embankment some below Moira collapsed. The cost of reinstatement was £9,864, and the canal reopened on 23 July 1919. The upper section was increasingly affected by subsidence from the coal mining. Despite this, the Moira Coal Company shipped 20,807 tons along the canal in 1943, and the total tonnage on the canal that year was 43,733 tons. The owners, by now the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), tried to give the canal to the Coventry Canal Company in 1944, but they refused it unless there was money to fund the maintenance. The section from Moira to Donisthorpe was promptly abandoned, allowing the Moira Coal Company to mine under its course. Another were closed in 1957, under an act of Parliament, the British Transport Commission Act 1957 (5 &amp; 6 Eliz. 2. c. xxxiii) obtained by the British Transport Commission, and the Measham to Snarestone section was closed in 1966, even though coal was regularly loaded there.

Traces of the old railway can still be seen, particularly towards Ticknall. A low embankment, still with some stone sleeper blocks crosses a field and a tunnel passes under the drive to Calke Abbey. There is also an arch bridge in Ticknall village where the line ran into the quarries.

==Restoration==

The closure of the canal north of Snarestone in 1966 led to the formation of the Ashby Canal Association, to ensure that no more was closed and to work towards the reopening of the northern section. In 1992, the engineering consultants W. S. Atkins produced a feasibility study for the restoration of the canal between Snarestone and Moira, which concluded that there were no obstacles which could not be resolved. They also recommended that the reconstruction should be suitable for broad-beam boats, rather than narrow boats, as this would have ecological advantages. By 1997, Leicestershire County Council had bought much of the route, and had located two funding packages worth over £1 million. However, they failed to reach agreement with one landowner over the purchase of a parcel of land, and because the deadlines were not met, the funding was lost. They therefore resolved to obtain an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992, which would allow them to use compulsory purchase powers if necessary. In order to promote and assist the restoration of the canal north of Snarestone, the Ashby Canal Trust was set up in 2000. It is a limited company, with directors representing the Ashby Canal Association, the Canal &amp; River Trust, Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council, the Inland Waterways Association, Leicestershire County Council and North West Leicestershire District Council.

Since the mining industry in the area has ceased, there have been fewer problems with subsidence, and the current plans are to re-open the canal to the National Forest visitor centre at Moira, about short of its original terminus at Spring Cottage. Between 1999 and 2005, a stretch of the canal near Moira was restored and re-filled with water, passing the historic Moira Furnace, a blast furnace from the 19th century which has been converted to provide visitor facilities including a craft centre, museum and cafe. The restored stretch is some long, and includes a new lock built to overcome the problems caused by mining subsidence. Below the restored section, the way forward has been blocked by the construction of the A42 main road across the canal&#x27;s formation. In November 2004, a public enquiry was held in connection with the application for a Transport and Works Order. Most objections were withdrawn, leaving one from English Nature, which was accommodated by including a provision for off-line nature reserves, and the Order was granted in October 2005.

The Order allows Leicestershire County Council to purchase land and construct of canal from Snarestone to Measham. Initially, this would follow the original route, but would diverge near Measham, to use the track of a redundant railway. The new canal would pass through Measham Station and cross the High Street on an aqueduct. The Transport and Works Act Order was introduced by the British Parliament in 1992 as a way of simplifying the legal processes for railway and canal projects, and works which interfere with navigation rights. Although a number of railway projects had previously been authorised under this legislation, the Ashby Canal Order obtained by Leicestershire County Council was the first time that construction of a canal had been authorised in this way. Purchase of the land between Snarestone and Measham had been completed by 2010. Re-construction of the first of the infilled section began on 26 February 2009, after a grant from the East Midlands Development Agency was secured. The £0.5 million project involved the provision of a stop lock, a new slipway, an improved winding hole and a wetland nature reserve, running parallel to the canal and connected to it. The stop lock chamber marks the division between the part of the canal owned by the Canal &amp; River Trust, and that owned by Leicestershire County Council, although no gates have been fitted while the length of canal beyond the chamber is short.

===Progress===
On 23 June 2011, Leicestershire County Council reached agreement with UK Coal for them to extract coal and fireclay at their Minorca Opencast site near Measham. As part of the planning gain, UK Coal will alter Gallows Lane to allow the new canal to pass under it, will provide a water storage lake, reducing the cost of the next phase by £1 million, and will provide £1.28 million to fund the reconstruction of the section north of Snarestone. They will also make available any clay removed from the site which is suitable for puddling the new section of waterway. Work on the extension towards Measham has been undertaken by contractors and volunteers, including members of the Waterway Recovery Group. In 2015, bridge 62, once known as Faulks Bridge, was reinstated, and a winding hole was constructed just beyond it, enabling boats to use the new section. The bridge is located about from the site of Gilwiskaw Aqueduct, which will be the next major structure to reinstate.

In 2013, parts of the restoration were threatened when the plans for the route of High Speed 2 (HS2), a high-speed rail link which would connect London to Birmingham, Manchester and York, were published. The new line would have cut through the middle of Measham, where a major development consisting of 450 houses, together with restoration of of the original route of the canal and the construction of a canal basin, was put on hold. Revised plans, published on 15 November 2016, routed the railway further to the east, crossing the line of the canal on a viaduct. As a result, the chairman of the Ashby Canal Association, Peter Oakden, expected work on the development to start in the summer of 2017, and was hopeful that the extension of the canal to link up with the Measham Wharf development could be completed by 2021, before any work on the rail link was likely to begin. However on 17 July 2017 the revised route of HS2 was rejected by the Secretary of State and a new final route within of the original 2013 proposal was confirmed. This route runs through the planned area for the 450 houses, causing the developers to cancel the development, and therefore the canal reinstatement in Measham, as unviable. In the longer term however, the latest HS2 route through Measham and the consequential moving of the A42 dual carriageway, should allow bridges to be built, funded by the HS2 project, for the canal to cross under both HS2 and the A42 when reinstated between Measham and Moira.

In 2020, the process of transferring the Transport and Works Order from Leicestershire County Council to the Ashby Canal Association was almost complete when it was interrupted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the transfer is completed, the association can proceed with further restoration work.

==Site of Special Scientific Interest==
The stretch between Carlton Bridge, north of Market Bosworth, and Turnover Bridge, north of Snarestone is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Leicestershire, designated in 1989. 
The site has diverse aquatic flora and invertebrates, and the submerged plants are of particular interest. These include mare&#x27;s tail, spiked water-milfoil and perfoliate pondweed. Nine species of dragonfly have been recorded, and there are also water shrews and the nationally rare water beetle &quot;Haliplus mucronatus&quot;. In 2013, the Canal and River Trust received a grant of nearly £20,000 from Natural England to enable them to tackle invasive species such as mink, terrapins, zander, Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed.

<text>Ralph Bates (12 February 1940 – 27 March 1991) was an English film and television actor, known for his role in the British sitcom &quot;Dear John&quot; and the 1975 series &quot;Poldark&quot;.

==Biography==

Bates was born in Bristol, England. His parents were both psychiatrists; his mother was French and he was a great-great-grandson of French scientist Louis Pasteur. He held dual-nationality and was bilingual, and was educated at Trinity College Dublin. He read French there, before winning a scholarship to Yale Drama School. The course completed, Bates returned to Ireland to make his stage debut in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; at The Gate Theatre, Dublin, in 1963. A career in repertory theatre followed, and the young actor gained experience in productions ranging from &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; to raucous comedies.

Later, Bates carved a niche in the world of horror films and played important roles or the lead in several Hammer Horror productions, such as &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Horror of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Lust for a Vampire&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde&quot;, in which he played a doctor who mistakenly transforms himself into a beautiful siren.

He portrayed Caligula in the series &quot;The Caesars&quot; and with Cyd Hayman in the &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; series. After playing Thomas Culpeper in an episode of &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970), he starred in the series &quot;Moonbase 3&quot; (1973) and &quot;Poldark&quot;, in which he played villainous George Warleggan. The series ran for 29 episodes, starting in 1975. He also played communist Paul Vercors in the final season of the drama series &quot;Secret Army&quot;. Because of his French ancestry and dark looks, he often was chosen to play a Frenchman on television, such as in an episode of ITV comedy drama &quot;Turtle&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Bates also appeared in the television movie &quot;Minder on the Orient Express&quot;, again as a Frenchman.

It looked, for some time, as if he might remain typecast in sinister roles, but he was offered a part in a comedy series by the writer John Sullivan, which saw Bates cast in a more sympathetic role as the newly divorced member of a singles group. &quot;Dear John&quot; (1986–87) ran for two series, and gave him chance to display a talent for comic roles. Around the same time, he appeared in the sitcom &quot;Farrington of the F.O.&quot; (1986) with Angela Thorne and Joan Sims.

==Personal life, illness and death==
In 1964 Bates married actress Joanna Van Gyseghem. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1973 he married actress Virginia Wetherell. The couple had a daughter Daisy (born 1974) and a son Will (born 1977).

Bates was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died from the disease ten weeks later in London, at the age of 51. The large metal cross marking his grave at Chiswick New Cemetery bears the epitaph &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry. Be Happy!&quot;

The Ralph Bates Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund is a registered charity.

<doc id="219231" wikidata="Q228986" url="?curid=219231" title="Hanafi school">
<text>The Hanafi school or Hanafism is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. It developed from the teachings of the jurist and theologian Abu Hanifa (), who systemised the use of reasoning (&quot;ra&#x27;y&quot;). Hanafi legal theory primarily derives law from the Quran, the sayings and practices of Muhammad (&quot;sunnah&quot;), scholarly consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;) and analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;), but also considers juristic discretion (&quot;istihsan&quot;) and local customs (&quot;urf&quot;). It is distinctive in its greater usage of &quot;qiyas&quot; than other schools.

The school spread throughout the Muslim world under the patronage of various Islamic empires, including the Abbasids and Seljuks. Transoxiana emerged as a centre of classical Hanafi scholarship between the 10th and 12th centuries, which gave rise to the Maturidi school of theology. The Ottoman Empire adopted Hanafism as its official school of law and influenced the legal thought of the school, eventually codifying it as the &quot;Mecelle&quot; in the 1870s.

Followers of the Hanafi school are called Hanafis, who are estimated to comprise two third of all Muslims. It is the largest Islamic legal school and is predominant in the Indian subcontinent, Turkey, Central Asia and much of the Levant.
== History ==
The Hanafi school emerged from the legal tradition of Kufa in Iraq, in which its eponym Abu Hanifa () resided. Iraqi jurists were known for their use of independent reasoning (&quot;ra&#x27;y&quot;) in deriving law. Kufa, alongside Medina and Basra, was a centre of legal activity at the beginning of the second Hijri century. Its prominent jurists included Amir al-Sha&#x27;bi, Ibrahim al-Nakha&#x27;i and Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman. The opinions of Abu Hanifa and the earlier Kufan jurists closely correspond, particularly those of al-Nakha&#x27;i. Abu Hanifa&#x27;s legal doctrine, as conveyed to his students, was predominantly derived from his own instructors, chiefly Hammad. Abu Hanifa attended Hammad&#x27;s study circle for approximately 20 years and inherited it upon Hammad&#x27;s death. 

=== Formative period ===

Abu Hanifa and his students were responsible for systemising the use of &quot;ra&#x27;y&quot;, of which Abu Hanifa was its &quot;unrivalled master&quot;. According to his contemporary Shu&#x27;bah, Abu Hanifa was the &quot;most systematic jurist of his time&quot;. His legal thought was distinct for its treatment of hypothetical scenarios, which he held would help prepare for disastrous circumstances. It was also distinct for its method of analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;). Abu Hanifa would identify the normative, underlying principles of the law from the Quran, hadith and practices of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, and applied these to solve unprecedented legal cases. &quot;Qiyas&quot; and adherence to analogical consistency were defining characteristics of early Hanafis, who employed juristic discretion (&quot;istihsan&quot;) to depart from the results of &quot;qiyas&quot; when deemed appropriate. As &quot;qiyas&quot; enabled the treatment of multiple legal cases from a single case, it facilitated the systematic compilation of legal literature.

There is no record of legal treatises authored by Abu Hanifa. His teachings were transmitted by his disciples Abu Yusuf () and Muhammad al-Shaybani (), the last of whom was the most prolific. Later Hanafis termed the corpus of al-Shaybani as the &quot;zahir al-riwaya&quot; and ascribed it an authoritative status. The students of Abu Hanifa established study circles in Baghdad, an emerging hub of cultural activity and the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate. The school won the support of the centralising Abbasid state, which sought to unify the legal system. The Abbasids&#x27; preference for appointing Hanafi judges assisted in spreading the school. Abu Yusuf served as a judge in Baghdad; the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid () later appointed him as the chief judge. By the time of al-Shaybani&#x27;s death, the school had spread to Egypt and Balkh in Tokharistan.

&quot;Ra&#x27;y&quot; dialectics involved the interlocutors exploring a series of hypothetical legal cases to delineate the limits of legal assumptions. In practice, it led Hanafis to favour widely accepted hadith, particularly those which enshrined general principles that were applicable to other cases. When the widespread collection of hadith led to the circulation of reports that contradicted Hanafi positions, the Hanafis prioritised those that were acted upon by the Iraqi legal tradition. Reports supported by Iraqi juristic practice were deemed more authoritative than those which were not. Abu Yusuf and al-Shaybani separately authored works named &quot;Kitab al-Athar&quot; ()&quot;,&quot; which sought to ground Hanafi teachings in the precedent of the early Kufan jurists and the Kufan companions of Muhammad, notably Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ud and Ali. Abu Hanifa himself is known to have used hadith; in Abu Yusuf&#x27;s &quot;Ikhtilaf Abi Ḥanifa wa-Ibn Abi Layla&quot;, which lists cases where Abu Hanifa differed with his contemporary Ibn Abi Layla, Abu Hanifa is quoted as citing a hadith in around 10% of the cases presented, but cites narrations attributed to Muhammad&#x27;s companions more often.

In contemporary external sources, members of the nascent school were described as the &quot;ashab abi ḥanifa&quot; (&quot;companions of Abu Hanifa&quot;) and the &quot;ashab al-ra&#x27;y&quot; (&quot;companions of &quot;ra&#x27;y&quot;&quot;). Early Hanafi doctrine was attacked by the traditionists, who accused Hanafis of preferring their &quot;ra&#x27;y&quot; to hadith. The traditionists primarily found objectionable the Hanafi practice of sometimes favouring &quot;qiyas&quot; over hadith that were not widely transmitted (&quot;ahad&quot;). The identification of Hanafis with the &quot;ashab al-ra&#x27;y&quot; in contradistinction to the traditionist &quot;ashab al-hadīth&quot; strengthened during the resurgence of the latter following the Mihna. Al-Shafi&#x27;i (), too, critiqued the Hanafis&#x27; treatment of hadith and their claim that their positions reflected those of the Kufan companions of Muhammad. He further argued that &quot;istihsan&quot; was subjective, which later led to classical Hanafi legal theorists articulating it as being completely dependent on the primary sources of law.

=== Classical period ===
During the 9th-century, the Hanafi school transitioned from a &quot;personal school&quot; centered around individual jurists and their study circles to a distinct legal community with a collectively recognised doctrine and authoritative figures. By the end of the century, the school resembled a professional body with a doctrine that was systematically transmitted from teachers to students, maturing into its classical form. Hanafis began to write commentaries on earlier works; until the 12th-century, these were mostly on the works of al-Shaybani. Al-Quduri ()&#x27;s legal primer &quot;Mukhtasar al-Quduri&quot; was the classical school&#x27;s first work of the &quot;mukhtasar&quot; genre and the most authoritative after that of al-Shaybani.

Criticism from the traditionists led to the Hanafis grounding their positions in hadith over the 9th-century. Some Hanafis moved towards using the traditionists&#x27; method of hadith criticism to justify the school&#x27;s positions, such as the Egyptian jurist al-Tahawi (). Nonetheless, the classical legal theorists focused on formulating a Hanafi approach to hadith criticism that emphasised a hadith&#x27;s acceptance by early jurists, with transmitter analysis taking a secondary role.During the 9th-century, the Hanafi school also emerged as the prevailing school in Transoxiana and Tokharistan. The school was introduced to Transoxiana by the students of Abu Hanifa and al-Shaybani, but became prevalent under the Samanids, during whose rule Hanafi scholars received official favour. The Transoxianan Hanafi tradition was highly influential in defining the doctrine of the later school. Works authored by Transoxianan jurists and accorded a high status in later Hanafi tradition include:
* The jurisprudential work of al-Sarakhsi (), known as &quot;Usul al-Sarakhsi&quot;, as well as his legal commentary &quot;al-Mabsut&quot;.
* The &quot;Hidayah&quot; of Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani (), which is considered the most authoritative representation of the early classical school.
* &quot;Badaʾiʿ al-Sanaʾiʿ&quot;, a large legal commentary by Ala al-Din al-Kasani ().
The intellectual descendants of al-Sarakhsi and his teacher, Abd al-Aziz ibn Ahmad al-Halwani (), eventually became the primary branch of the Transoxianan tradition. For 300 years after al-Sarakhsi, the Halwani-Sarakhsi branch constituted almost all of the major jurists engaged in rule-formulation (&quot;tarjih&quot;) within the school, and dominated the process. The process contributed to the stabilisation of the school&#x27;s laws. The branch also popularised the doctrine of the &quot;zahir al-riwaya&quot;: that the opinions transmitted from the school&#x27;s founders command the highest level of authority within the school. 

In the 10th-century, the Hanafi theologian Abu Mansur al-Maturidi () developed a &quot;kalam&quot; tradition that crystallised into the Maturidi school of theology, which had descended directly from the theological views of the earliest Hanafis. Due to philosophical differences, the Transoxianan Maturidis disagreed with the Mu&#x27;tazilite strain of Iraqi Hanafis on several technical points of legal theory, but saw limited success in expunging the Mu&#x27;tazilite influence.

The Oghuz Turks who founded the Seljuk Empire became attached to the Transoxianan Hanafi tradition. The Seljuks favoured the eastern Hanafis and appointed them to various official positions in their new territories, encouraging their migration out of Central Asia. During the Seljuk expansion of the 11th and 12th centuries, the Hanafi and Maturidi schools spread westward into Syria, Anatolia and western Persia. In Syria and Iraq, the Central Asian scholars brought with them an increased emphasis on the &quot;zahir al-riwaya&quot;. Hanafi migration out of Central Asia accelerated during the Mongol invasions, which ravaged the region.

=== Mamluk period ===
During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Mamluk Sultanate saw an influx of Hanafi scholars from Anatolia and Central Asia. Discussions of Islamic logic and &quot;kalam&quot; in the Mamluk jurisprudential literature reflect the influence of Central Asian scholars.

Criticism of the Hanafi approach to hadith prompted Mamluk Hanafi scholars to treat the subject in more detail. In his legal commentary &quot;Fath al-Qadir&quot;, the Mamluk jurist Ibn al-Humam () engages with the traditionists&#x27; approach to hadith criticism, and attempts to navigate the associated legal consequences. His approach to hadith influenced later Egyptian and Syrian Hanafi scholars. This &quot;Egyptian school&quot; of Hanafi hadith criticism referenced hadith from the hadith collections instead of Hanafi legal works, and employed the traditionists&#x27; terminology to assess their authenticity.

Mamluk jurists faced difficulties in interpreting the plurality of legal opinions that had accrued in the school. In his work &quot;al-Tashih wa-al-tarjih&quot;, the Mamluk jurist () developed and detailed the process of rule-determination, clarifying the role of precedent and enabling other jurists to engage in the process themselves, and thus determine the applicable legal ruling for a given case. It marked a shift in the material consulted by muftis from the primary literature of the school to its secondary literature, comprising legal commentaries and compendia which contained rulings. 

=== Ottoman era ===

The Ottoman Empire adopted the Hanafi school as their official legal school. The Ottomans established an extensive network of &quot;madrasas&quot; to train jurists, with the most prestigious located in the capital Constantinople. By the 16th-century, the &quot;Şeyḫülislâm&quot; emerged as the chief imperial religious and judicial authority. The &quot;Şeyḫülislâm&quot; was appointed by the sultan and presided over the imperial canon, a collection of legal texts that the imperial religious hierarchy was required to consult. Many jurists from Arab provinces of the empire were critical of the imperial canon, partly because of its inclusion of later works which they judged as contradicting the preferred opinions (&quot;tarjih&quot;) of the school. The sultans influenced the formation of the imperial religious hierarchy by appointing &quot;muftis&quot; directly and through the &quot;Şeyḫülislâm&quot;, delineating the range of legal opinions in the Ottoman Hanafi tradition. Members of the imperial religious hierarchy were described as &quot;Rūmīs&quot;. Intellectual genealogies (&quot;tabaqat&quot;) authored by the imperial religious hierarchy aimed to demarcate the institution, situate themselves and their endorsed works in the broader Hanafi tradition and construct an unbroken intellectual chain to Abu Hanifa.

Hanafi law co-existed with the &quot;qanun&quot; (dynastic law), decrees and edicts promulgated by the sultans. The &quot;qanun&quot; often reaffirmed religious laws; in other cases, it authorised actions that the jurists opposed, such as torture. The &quot;Şeyḫülislâm&quot; would sometimes request sultanic edicts to require the imperial religious hierarchy to enforce particular rulings of the school. The &quot;Maʿrūḍāt&quot; of the &quot;Şeyḫülislâm&quot; Ebussuud Efendi (), a collection of &quot;fatwas&quot; endorsed by Suleiman I, contained sultanic edicts and was frequently referenced in later Hanafi works which considered its opinions binding. Late Hanafis believed that judges could act as deputies of the sultan who could thus regulate, &quot;inter alia&quot;, the legal opinions judges could reference, such as in the case of inter-school disputes. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hanafi jurists began to incorporate sultanic edicts into authoritative legal works.

Ibrahim al-Halabi ()&#x27;s legal manual &quot;Multaqa al-Abhur&quot; was among the most popular in the empire and was the subject of over 70 commentaries. By the 19th-century, it had become the standard legal textbook. Other popular Ottoman manuals were the &quot;Durar al-Hukkam&quot; of Molla Hüsrev () and &quot;al-Durr al-Mukhtar&quot; of Haskafi. The &quot;Radd al-Muhtar&quot; of the late Arab-Ottoman jurist Ibn Abidin () is considered an authoritative and representative work of the late Hanafi tradition. It lists most opinions within the school and their level of authoritativeness, incorporating most primary Hanafi sources produced until its writing. It employs legal devices such as necessity (&quot;darura&quot;) to depart from the canonical &quot;zahir al-riwaya&quot; where necessary to ensure the continued relevancy of the school, and references sultanic edicts to revise the school&#x27;s opinions.

Between 1869 and 1877, the Ottomans promulgated the &quot;Mecelle&quot;, a codification of Hanafi jurisprudence. The &quot;Mecelle&quot; was drafted by a committee led by the jurist Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, who had successfully argued against the implementation of the Napoleonic Code. It drew from the Hanafi literature on legal maxims (&quot;qawaʿid fiqhiyya&quot;) and to a great degree favoured the opinions of the late Hanafi tradition. Many of its articles were fully or partially derived from al-Halabi&#x27;s &quot;Multaqa al-Abhur&quot;. However, the &quot;Mecelle&quot; also marked the state&#x27;s assumption of control over jurisprudence, which had previously been the purview of the decentralized juristic community.

=== Indian subcontinent ===

The Hanafi school spread to India from Transoxiana and eastern Persia. To consolidate control over his realm, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb () ordered the compilation of Hanafi &quot;fatwas&quot;. Completed between 1664 and 1672, the resulting &quot;al-Fatawa l-ʿAlamgiriyya&quot; selected legal opinions from earlier Hanafi legal works and is modelled after the &quot;Hidayah&quot; of al-Marghinani.

During the colonization of India, the East India Company sought to create a &quot;complete digest of Hindu and Mussulman law&quot; to eliminate legal pluralism. The resulting Anglo-Muhammadan law was based in part on a translation of al-Marghinani&#x27;s &quot;Hidayah&quot;, which was chosen for its brevity and its belonging to the Hanafi school, which most Indian Muslims followed. Consequently, the &quot;Hidayah&quot; was effectively codified and severed from the Hanafi commentarial tradition under which it was traditionally interpreted.

In the 19th-century, the Hanafi Deobandi movement emerged in India. The Deobandis&#x27; legal views include strict adherence (&quot;taqlid&quot;) to a legal school in contradistinction to the Ahl-i Hadith movement, and emphasise the importance of hadith. The Deobandi acceptance of Ibn al-Humam&#x27;s approach to hadith criticism culminated in the &quot;I&#x27;la al-Sunan&quot; of Deobandi scholar Zafar Ahmad Usmani (), a work that attempts to justify Hanafi positions using hadith.

=== Contemporary era ===

Today, the Hanafi school is the largest Islamic school of law, constituting approximately one-third of all Muslims. It is the predominant school in the former Ottoman territories, including Turkey and much of the Levant. It is also predominant among Muslims in Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, China, the Caucasus and the Balkans. In Pakistan, it is estimated that 75% of Muslims subscribe to the Hanafi Deobandi and Barelwi movements.

The Ottoman &quot;Mecelle&quot; was repealed by most post-Ottoman states over the first half of the 20th-century. Parts remained in force in Jordan and Israel until the 1970s. Where it is dominant, the Hanafi school is followed in religious observance and, in some regions, continues to govern Muslim family law.

== Legal theory ==
The legal theory (&quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;) of the Hanafi school recognises the following sources of law, listed in order of epistemic authority: the Quran, the practices and sayings of Muhammad (&quot;sunnah&quot;) as documented in the hadith, consensus of opinion (&quot;ijma&quot;)&quot;, qiyas&quot;, &quot;istihsan&quot; and local customs (&quot;urf&quot;). Texts with equal epistemic authority may modify each other; if they are of differing levels, the text with the weaker epistemic authority is rejected in favour of the stronger one.

=== Quran ===
The Quran is the primary source of Hanafi law. In Hanafi legal theory, it is considered acceptable to adduce non-canonical Quranic readings related by the companions of Muhammad as legal evidence, but they are not treated as part of the Quranic text. For example, classical Hanafi jurists are known to have cited the non-Uthmanic reading of Ibn Mas&#x27;ud but treated it akin to an exegetical gloss.

=== Hadith ===
The Hanafis categorise hadith as mass-transmitted (&quot;mutawatir&quot;), famous (&quot;mashhur&quot;) or solitary (&quot;ahad&quot;) depending on the nature of their chain of transmission (&quot;isnad&quot;): 
* A &quot;mutawatir&quot; hadith is transmitted by such a large number of people on each level of its &quot;isnad&quot; that it is impossible for it to have been forged. It imparts epistemically certain knowledge about the &quot;sunnah&quot;.
* A &quot;mashhur&quot; hadith is transmitted by a limited number of people at the first level of its &quot;isnad&quot; but was widely acted upon by jurists, beginning with their first generations. It imparts epistemically near-certain knowledge about the &quot;sunnah&quot;.
* An &quot;ahad&quot; hadith, also known as a &quot;singular report&quot; (&quot;khabar al-wahid&quot;), is one which is neither &quot;mutawatir&quot; nor &quot;mashur&quot;.
Only &quot;mutawatir&quot; and &quot;mashhur&quot; hadith may abrogate a Quranic verse, whether by replacing, qualifying or restricting its understanding. An &quot;ahad&quot; hadith cannot be adduced in legal discussions of &quot;great importance&quot; as Hanafis assume that God would have ensured the reliable transmission of critical religious knowledge; nor can it be used if its early transmitters did not act upon it, as Hanafis assume that their inaction indicates that it is not part of the &quot;sunnah&quot;.

=== &quot;Ijma&quot; ===
&quot;Ijma&quot; refers to the consensus of opinion. &quot;Ijma&quot; may be explicit, with all &quot;mujtahids&quot; agreeing verbally or through actions, or tacit, where some express an opinion while others remain silent. In the Hanafi view, tacit &quot;ijma&quot; can only establish a concession (&quot;rukhsah&quot;) rather than a strict rule (&quot;azimah&quot;). The Hanafis believe that the companions of Muhammad reached &quot;ijma&quot; on some matters, and some Hanafis regard agreement between Abu Bakr and Umar, the first two Rashidun caliphs, as being &quot;ijma&quot;.

=== &quot;Qiyas&quot; ===
&quot;Qiyas&quot;, also referred to analogical reasoning, involves extending a ruling on an original case (&quot;asl&quot;) to a subsidiary case (&quot;&#x27;far&quot;) where both cases share an effective cause (&quot;&#x27;illah&quot;)&quot;.&quot; For example, because of the prohibition of usury, it is forbidden to exchange wheat and other commodities for each other unless the transaction is immediate and the amount of both goods are equal. Hanafis extend this prohibition to apples through &quot;qiyas&quot;, as they identify the underlying &quot;&#x27;illah&quot; as the exchange of a measurable commodity, and apples are measurable.

Compared to the other Sunni and Shi&#x27;ite schools of law, Hanafis use &quot;qiyas&quot; more extensively and grant it greater authority. However, it is deemed a last resort only to be used when no ruling can be derived from the Quran, &quot;sunnah&quot; and &quot;ijma&quot;. Hanafis view &quot;qiyas&quot; as a means of revealing pre-existing implicit rulings within the law rather than as a source of new rulings. Because the law is viewed as coherent and internally consistent, a valid &quot;qiyas&quot; must accord with its internal rationality. 

If a ruling derived from &quot;qiyas&quot; conflicts with that from an &quot;ahad&quot; hadith, the Hanafis disagree on which takes precedence. One group argues that the &quot;ahad&quot; hadith always takes precedence, while a second group, led by Isa ibn Aban (), opine that it only takes precedence if transmitted by a companion of Muhammad known to be a jurist. In general, the early classical school always followed hadith transmitted by jurist-companions regardless of its correspondence with &quot;qiyas&quot;, but followed hadith transmitted by non-jurist companions only if it corresponded with a possible &quot;qiyas&quot;, and thus accorded with the internal rationale of the law. By the Ottoman period, however, the distinction had become less popular and non-jurist companions were largely treated the same as jurist companions.

The Hanafis require the original case to not directly state the &quot;&#x27;illah&quot;. The &quot;&#x27;illah&quot; must be deduced by other means&quot;.&quot; If the &quot;&#x27;illah&quot; is stated, then the ruling is applied to other cases via the &quot;indication of the text&quot; (&quot;dalalat al-nass&quot;), not &quot;qiyas&quot;. &quot;Dalalat al-nass&quot; is an exercise in linguistic interpretation rather than analogical reasoning.

=== &quot;Istihsan&quot; ===
&quot;Istihsan&quot; refers to juristic discretion. The Hanafi jurist al-Sarakhsi () describes it as a means through which a jurist can depart from a ruling derived through &quot;qiyas&quot; to ameliorate hardship, where the new ruling is typically supported by a superior proof, such as the Quran, &quot;sunnah&quot;, necessity (&quot;darurah&quot;) or an alternative &quot;qiyas&quot;. For example, by way of necessity, the Hanafi jurists allow a son to buy food or medicine for his ill father from the father&#x27;s property without his prior permission. Hanafi &quot;istihsan&quot; based on necessity is, however, less broad than Maliki &quot;istihsan&quot; based on public welfare (&quot;maslaha&quot;).

&quot;Istihsan&quot; emerged out of concerns among Hanafis that unrestrained &quot;qiyas&quot; could lead to results that were absurd or contradicted the &quot;sunnah&quot;. The earliest Hanafis, including Abu Hanifa and al-Shaybani, more frequently used &quot;istihsan&quot; justified by subjective and pragmatic reasoning rather than on evidential grounds. Their use of &quot;istihsan&quot; sought to change the scope or outcome of a ruling due to its potential effects. More often than not, they deployed &quot;istihsan&quot; in a way that cannot be considered as ameliorating hardship, such as establishing the liability of a group of thieves involved in theft even if only one of them carried the stolen goods. Subjective &quot;istihsan&quot; declined due to attacks from al-Shafi&#x27;i, and Hanafi legal theorists would systemise it into the form eventually espoused by al-Sarakhsi, attempting to incorporate elements of subjectivity into the definition of necessity.

=== &quot;Urf&quot; ===
&quot;Urf&quot; refers to customary practices. The Hanafis consider it as an ancillary source of law that is subordinate to the primary sources of law. &quot;Urf&quot; is divided into two types: general (&quot;al-urf al-&#x27;amm&quot;) and special (&quot;al-urf al-khass&quot;). A general &quot;urf&quot; refers to a customary practice that is widely accepted among a people regardless of the time period. As part of &quot;istihsan&quot;, the Hanafis permit favouring general &quot;urf&quot; over a ruling derived through &quot;qiyas&quot;. A special &quot;urf&quot; is more local and is upheld by a particular location or profession. Most Hanafis agree that special &quot;urf&quot; cannot qualify the general meaning of a textual evidence (&quot;nass&quot;), and that a ruling derived from &quot;qiyas&quot; takes precedence over special &quot;urf&quot;, although there is some disagreement on this. Ali Bardakoğlu suggests that the emphasis given to &quot;urf&quot; in Hanafi legal theory can partly explain the spread of the school among disparate non-Arab groups.

<text>The Hanbali school or Hanbalism () is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. It is named after and based on the teachings of the 9th-century scholar, jurist and traditionist, Ahmad ibn Hanbal (), and later institutionalized by his students. One who ascribes to the Hanbali school is called a Hanbali, Hanbalite or Hanbalist (, or ). It is the smallest and adheres the most strictly to the traditionalist school of theology out of the four major Sunni schools, the others being the Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi&#x27;i schools.

Like the other Sunni schools, it primarily derives sharia from the Quran, hadith and views of Muhammad&#x27;s companions. In cases where there is no clear answer in the sacred texts of Islam, the Hanbali school does not accept juristic discretion or customs of a community as sound bases to derive Islamic law on their own—methods that the Hanafi and Maliki schools accept. It is found primarily in the countries of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where it is the official jurisprudence. Hanbali followers are the demographic majority in four emirates of the UAE: Sharjah, Umm al-Quwain, Ras al-Khaimah and Ajman. Large minorities of Hanbali followers are also found in Bahrain, Syria, Oman, and Yemen, and among Iraqi and Jordanian bedouins.

With the rise of the 18th-century conservative Wahhabi movement, the Hanbali school experienced a great reformation. The Wahabbi movement&#x27;s founder, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, collaborated with the House of Saud to spread Hanbali teachings with a Wahabbist interpretation around the world. However, British orientalist Michael Cook argues Ahmad&#x27;s own beliefs actually played &quot;no real part in the establishment of the central doctrines of Wahhabism&quot;, and in spite of their shared tradition, &quot;the older Hanbalite authorities had doctrinal concerns very different from those of the Wahhabis&quot;. Other scholars maintain Ahmad was &quot;the distant progenitor of Wahhabism&quot; and also inspired the similar Salafi movement.

==History==
Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of Hanbali school of thought (&quot;madhab&quot;), was a disciple of the Sunni Imam Al-Shafi‘i, who was reportedly a student of Imam Malik ibn Anas, who was a student of the Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, like Imam Abu Hanifa. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni &quot;Fiqh&quot; are connected to Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq from the &quot;Bayt&quot; (Household) of Muhammad, whether directly or indirectly.

Like Al-Shafi&#x27;i and Dawud al-Zahiri, Ahmad was deeply concerned with the extreme elasticity being deployed by many jurists of his time, who used their discretion to reinterpret the doctrines of &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadiths&quot; to suit the demands of Caliphs and wealthy. Ibn Hanbal advocated for a literal interpretation of &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadiths&quot;. Influenced by the debates of his time, he was known for rejecting religious rulings (&quot;fatwas&quot;) from the &quot;&#x27;Ijma&quot; (consensus) of jurists of his time, which he considered to be speculative theology (&quot;Kalam&quot;). He associated them with the Mu&#x27;tazilis, whom he despised. Ibn Hanbal was also hostile to the discretionary principles of rulings in jurisprudence (&quot;Usul al-fiqh&quot;) mainly championed by the people of opinion, which was established by Abu Hanifa, although he did adopt al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s method in usul al-fiqh. He linked these discretionary principles with &quot;kalam&quot;. His guiding principle was that the &quot;Quran&quot; and Sunnah are the only proper sources of Islamic jurisprudence, and are of equal authority and should be interpreted literally in line with the Athari creed. He also believed that there can be no true consensus (&quot;Ijma&quot;) among jurists (&quot;mujtahids&quot;) of his time, and preferred the consensus of Muhammad&#x27;s companions (&quot;Sahaba&quot;) and weaker hadiths. Imam Hanbal himself compiled &quot;Al-Musnad&quot;, a text with over 30,000 saying, actions and customs of Muhammad.

Ibn Hanbal never composed an actual systematic legal theory on his own, and was against setting up juristic superstructures. He devoted himself to the task of collection and study of Hadith; and believed that legal rulings must be derived by referring directly to the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot;; instead of referring to a body of religious jurisprudence. However; his followers would later establish a systematic legal methodology some generations after Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s death. Much of the work of preserving the school based on Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s method was laid by his student Abu Bakr al-Khallal; his documentation on the founder&#x27;s views eventually reached twenty volumes. The original copy of the work, which was contained in the House of Wisdom, was burned along with many other works of literature during the Mongol siege of Baghdad. The book was only preserved in a summarized form by the Hanbali jurist al-Khiraqi, who had access to written copies of al-Khallal&#x27;s book before the siege.

Relations with the Abbasid Caliphate were rocky for the Hanbalites. Led by the Hanbalite scholar Al-Hasan ibn &#x27;Ali al-Barbahari, the school often formed mobs of followers in 10th-century Baghdad who would engage in violence against fellow Sunnis suspected of committing sins and all Shi&#x27;ites. During al-Barbahari&#x27;s leadership of the school in Baghdad, shops were looted, female entertainers were attacked in the streets, popular grievances among the lower classes were agitated as a source of mobilization, and public chaos in general ensued. Their efforts would be their own undoing in 935, when a series of home invasions and mob violence on the part of al-Barbahari&#x27;s followers in addition to perceived deviant views led to the Caliph Ar-Radi publicly condemning the school in its entirety and ending its official patronage by state religious bodies.

According to Christopher Melchert, medieval Hanbali literature is rich in references to saints, grave visitation, miracles, and relics. Historically, the Hanbali school has been seen as one of the four major Sunni &quot;madhahib&quot; (schools of law), and many prominent medieval Sufis, such as Abdul Qadir Gilani, were Hanbali jurists and mystics at the same time.

At some point between the 10th and 12th centuries, the Hanbali scholars began adopting the term “Salafi&quot;. The influential 13th century Hanbali theologian Ibn Taymiyya advocated Salafi thought as a theological endeavour and his efforts would create a lasting impact on the subsequent followers of the Hanbali school.

Now, most of the followers of the Hanbali school are present in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman.

==Principles==
===Sources of law===
Like all other schools of Sunni Islam, the Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah found in Hadiths (compilation of sayings, actions and customs of Muhammad). Where these texts did not provide guidance, Imam Hanbal recommended guidance from established consensus of Muhammad&#x27;s companions (Sahabah), then individual opinion of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, followed in order of preference by weaker hadiths, and in rare cases analogy (Qiyas). The Hanbali school, unlike Hanafi and Maliki schools, rejected that a source of Islamic law can be a jurist&#x27;s personal discretionary opinion or consensus of later generation Muslims on matters that serve the interest of Islam and community. Hanbalis hold that this is impossible and leads to abuse. 

Ibn Hanbal rejected the possibility of religiously binding consensus (&quot;Ijma&quot;), as it was impossible to verify once later generations of Muslims spread throughout the world, going as far as declaring anyone who claimed as such to be a liar. Ibn Hanbal did, however, accept the possibility and validity of the consensus of the &quot;Sahaba&quot; the first generation of Muslims. Later followers of the school, however, expanded on the types of consensus accepted as valid, and the prominent Hanbalite Ibn Taymiyyah expanded legal consensus to later generations while at the same time restricting it only to the religiously learned. Analogical reasoning (&quot;Qiyas&quot;), was likewise rejected as a valid source of law by Ibn Hanbal himself, with a near-unanimous majority of later Hanbalite jurists not only accepting analogical reasoning as valid but also borrowing from the works of Shafi&#x27;ite jurists on the subject.

Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s strict standards of acceptance regarding the sources of Islamic law were probably due to his suspicion regarding the field of &quot;Usul al-Fiqh&quot;, which he equated with speculative theology (&quot;kalam&quot;). While demanding strict application of &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;, Hanbali &quot;Fiqh&quot; is nonetheless flexible in areas not covered by Scriptures. In issues where the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and the &quot;Hadiths&quot; were ambiguous or vague; the Hanbali &quot;Fuqaha&quot; (jurists) engaged in &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to derive rulings. Additionally, the Hanbali madh&#x27;hab accepted the Islamic principle of &quot;Maslaha&quot; (&#x27;public interest&#x27;) in solving the novel issues. In the modern era, Hanbalites have branched out and even delved into matters regarding the upholding (&quot;Istislah&quot;) of public interest (&quot;Maslaha&quot;) and even juristic preference (&quot;Istihsan&quot;), anathema to the earlier Hanbalites as valid methods of determining religious law.

===Theology===

Ibn Hanbal taught that the Qur&#x27;an is uncreated due to Muslim belief that it is the word of God, and the word of God is not created. The Muʿtazilites taught that the Qur&#x27;an, which is readable and touchable, is created like other creatures and created objects. Ibn Hanbal viewed this as heresy, replying that there are things which are not touchable but are created, such as the Throne of God. Unlike the other three schools of Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi), the Hanbali madhab remained largely traditionalist or Athari in theology and it was primarily Hanbali scholars who codified the Athari school of thought.

==Distinct rulings==
===Purity (&quot;tahara&quot;)===
====Ablution (&quot;wudu&quot;&#x27;)====
*Saying &quot;with the name of God&quot; (&quot;bi-smi llāh&quot;) is necessary, but waived if one forgets or is ignorant.
*It is obligatory and a pillar (&quot;rukn&quot;) to wash the mouth and nose, and is not waived.
*It is obligatory and a pillar to wipe the entire head, including the ears, and is not waived. Wiping the neck is not recommended.
*It is recommended to lengthen the whiteness that will appear on the Day of Judgement by washing to the top of the arms and shins.
*Impurities, such as blood, pus, and vomit, nullify ablution if they come out the body in large amounts, but not small amounts. If they come out the front or back private parts, it nullifies it regardless of the amount. Also, urine and stool nullify it regardless of the amount and where it came out from.
*Light sleep when standing or sitting does not nullify ablution.
*Touching someone of the opposite sex with any part of the body nullifies ablution if done with lust (&quot;shahwah&quot;). The hair, teeth, and nails are not included.
*Touching the front or back private part with the hand nullifies ablution. The testicles are not included.
*Wind passing from the woman&#x27;s front private part nullifies ablution.
*Eating camel meat nullifies ablution, whether raw or cooked. All other parts, such as its fat, liver, or pancreas, do not.
*Washing the dead nullifies ablution.
*Apostasy nullifies ablution.

====Impurities (&quot;najasa&quot;)====
*A minimum of three wipes is obligatory to cleanse the impurity after relieving oneself, and any less will not suffice. If there is still impurity after that, more wipes must be used until the effect is achieved. Microscopic amounts are excused.
*Washing the hands three times is obligatory after awakening from a night&#x27;s sleep. Naps during the day are not included.
*Impurities must be washed seven times with water to be rendered pure. Nothing can cleanse impurities except purifying (&quot;ṭahūr&quot;) water.
*Transforming one substance into another does not render it pure, even if it changes its chemical properties, except alcohol (&quot;khamr&quot;).
*If an impurity falls into pure (&quot;ṭāhir&quot;) water less than two &quot;qullahs&quot; in volume, all of it is rendered impure (&quot;najis&quot;). If it is more than two &quot;qullahs&quot;, it remains pure. If the liquid the impurity falls into is other than water, it will be rendered impure regardless of the amount.
*Semen (&quot;madī&quot;) is pure.
*Blood, pus, vomit, pre-ejaculate fluid (&quot;madhī&quot;), and white discharge after urinating (&quot;wadī&quot;) are impure. However, a small amount of blood and pus is excused.
*Cat hair and saliva are pure.
*All seafood is generally pure and permissible.
*Pigs, dogs, donkeys, predators larger than a cat, birds with talons, and all animals derived from them are all impure and impermissible.
*Leather from unslaughtered animals is impure, even if tanned.
*Rennet from unslaughtered animals is impure and impermissible.
*Vinegar made with human intervention is impure and impermissible, but pure and permissible if formed naturally.

===Prayer (&quot;salah&quot;)===
====Standing (&quot;qiyam&quot;)====
*It is recommended to grasp (&quot;qabd&quot;) the hands below the navel, as stated in &quot;Kashshaf al-Qina&quot;&#x27; by Mansur al-Buhuti, &quot;al-Mughni&quot; of Ibn Qudamah, and other works. This is also the position of the Hanafi school, as well as Abu Hanifa and his students, Sufyan ath-Thawri, Ishaq ibn Rahuyah, Ibrahim an-Nakha&#x27;i, and other scholars among the predecessors (&quot;salaf&quot;).

Other views on where to place them do exist in the school, due to conflicting narrations from Ahmad:
#Above the navel and below the chest
#On the navel
#A choice wherever to place them
#Letting them hang free (&quot;ṣadl&quot;)
#Grasping them in obligatory prayers, but letting them hang free in voluntary prayers
*Reciting another chapter (&quot;sūrah&quot;) after reciting the chapter al-Fatihah is recommended and not obligatory.
*It is recommended to look at the place of prostration when standing and throughout the entire prayer, except the testimony.

===Other===
*Most Hanbali scholars consider admission in a court of law to be indivisible, that is, a plaintiff may not accept some parts of a defendant&#x27;s testimony while rejecting other parts. This position is also held by the Zahiri school, though opposed by the Hanafi and Maliki schools.

==Reception==
The Hanbali school is now accepted as the fourth of the mainstream Sunni schools of law. It has traditionally enjoyed a smaller following than the other schools. In the earlier period, Sunni jurisprudence was based on four other schools: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Zahiri; later on, the Hanbali school supplanted the Zahiri school&#x27;s spot as the fourth mainstream school. Hanbalism essentially formed as a traditionalist reaction to what they viewed as &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (innovations) on the part of the earlier established schools.

Historically, the school&#x27;s legitimacy was not always accepted. Muslim exegete Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, founder of the now extinct Jariri school of law, was noted for ignoring the Hanbali school entirely when weighing the views of jurists; this was due to his view that the founder, Ibn Hanbal, was merely a scholar of &quot;Hadith&quot; (prophetic traditions) and was not a &quot;Faqih&quot; (jurist) at all. The Hanbalites, led by Al-Barbahari, reacted by stoning Tabari&#x27;s home several times, inciting riots so violent that Abbasid authorities had to subdue them by force. Upon Tabari&#x27;s death, the Hanbalites formed a violent mob large enough that Abbasid officials buried him in secret, in an attempt to prevent further riots. Similarly, the Andalusian Malikite Jurist and theologian Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Barr made a point to exclude Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s views from the books on Sunni Muslim jurisprudence. 

Eventually, the Mamluk Sultanate and later the Ottoman Empire codified Sunni Islam as four schools, including the Hanbalite school at the expense of the Zahirites. The Hanafis, Shafi&#x27;is and Malikis agreed on important matters and recognized each other&#x27;s systems as equally valid; this was not the case with the Hanbalites, who were recognized as legitimate by the older three schools but refused to return the favor.

==Differences with other Sunni schools==
In contrast to the Hanafis and the Malikis, in the absence of a &quot;&#x27;Ijma&quot; (juristic consensus), the opinion of a Sahabi (companion of Muhammad) is given priority over &quot;Qiyas&quot; (analogical reasoning, which early Hanbalis rejected) or &quot;al-&#x27;urf&quot; (customs of a land) which is completely rejected by Hanbalis. While Hanbalis require a unanimous consensus, Hanafis tend to follow the consensus of Kufa and Malikis that of al-Madina.

Zahiris, a less mainstream school, is sometimes seen as the closest to Hanbalis and Hanafis. However the similarities are only true for early Zahiris who followed the Athari creed. The branch that was largely instigated by Ibn Hazm which developed in al-Andalus, al-Qarawiyyin and later became the official school of the state under the Almohads, differed significantly from Hanbalism. It did not follow the Athari and &quot;Taqlid&quot; schools and opted for &quot;logical Istidlal&quot; (deductive demonstration/inference) as a way to interpret scripture that wasn&#x27;t clear literally. Hanbalis rejected &quot;kalam&quot; as a whole and believed in the supremacy of the text over the mind and did not engage in dialectic debates with the &quot;Mu&#x27;tazila&quot;. Ibn Hazm, on the other hand, engaged in these debates and believed in logical reasoning rejecting most of &quot;Mu&#x27;tazila&quot; claims as sophism and absurd. Ibn Hazm, also scrutinised &quot;hadith&quot; corpus more severely. He adopted an attitude where he&#x27;d reject &quot;hadiths&quot; if he discovered something suspicious about the lives of those who reported it, or in the case where a narrator in the &quot;Sanad&quot; (transmission chain) is not a widely known figure. In doing so, he was aided by his vast historical knowledge.

By the end of the classical era, the other three remaining schools had codified their laws into comprehensive jurisprudential systems; enforcing them far and wide. However, the Hanbalis stood apart from the other three &quot;madh&#x27;habs&quot;; by insisting on referring directly back to the &quot;Qur’an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot;, to arrive at legal rulings. They also opposed the codification of &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) into a comprehensive system of jurisprudence; considering the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot; to be the paramount sources.

==Relationship with Sufism==
Sufism, often described as the inner mystical dimension of Islam, is not a separate &quot;school&quot; or &quot;sect&quot; of the religion, but, rather, is considered by its adherents to be an &quot;inward&quot; way of approaching Islam which complements the regular outward practice of the five pillars; Sufism became immensely popular during the medieval period in practically all parts of the Sunni world and continues to remain so in many parts of the world today. As Christopher Melchert has pointed out, both Hanbalism and classical Sufism took concrete shapes in the ninth and early tenth-centuries CE, with both soon becoming &quot;essential components of the high-medieval Sunni synthesis.&quot; Although many Hanbali scholars today, identifying themselves with various Salafi movements and the contemporary manifestation of the Wahhabi movement within Hanbalism, shun Sufism and its practices such as the &quot;Ziyarat&quot; (visitations of the graves of &quot;Awliyaa&quot;), which they deem heretical innovations in religion; the Hanbali school of Sunni law had a very intimate relationship with Sufism throughout Islamic history.

There is evidence that many early medieval Hanbali scholars were very close to the Sufi martyr and saint Hallaj, whose mystical piety seems to have influenced many regular jurists in the school. This is likely due to Al-Hallaj himself being a fanatical follower of Hanbali school with reports saying he would pray 500 time a day outside the tomb of Ahmed Bin Hanbal. Hallaj was also saved by many Hanbalis during the multiple times he was arrested in Baghdad prior to his execution. Tustari was also known to be a Hanbali and was the Sufi teacher of the Hanbali polemicist Al-Barbahari. Many later Hanbalis, meanwhile, were often Sufis themselves, including figures not normally associated with Sufism, such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah. Both these men, sometimes considered to be completely anti-Sufi in their leanings, were actually initiated into the &quot;Qadiriyya&quot; order of the celebrated mystic and saint Abdul Qadir Gilani, who was himself a renowned Hanbali &quot;Faqih&quot;. As the &quot;Qadiriyya&quot; &quot;Tariqah&quot; is often considered to be the largest and most widespread Sufi order in the world, with many branches spanning from Turkey to Pakistan, one of the largest Sufi branches is effectively founded on Hanbali school. Other prominent Hanbalite scholars who praised Sufism include Ibn &#x27;Aqil, Ibn Qudamah, Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, etc.

Although Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab is sometimes regarded as a denier of Sufism, both he and his early disciples acclaimed &quot;Tasawwuf&quot;; believing it to be an important discipline in Islamic religion. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab prescribed various Sufi spiritual exercises to his followers for attaining &quot;Zuhd&quot; (asceticism), in accordance with &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;. Extolling the virtuous Sufi &quot;Awliya&quot; (saints) who attained &quot;Ma&#x27;rifa&quot; (highest stage of mystical awareness in Sufism) as exemplars to his followers, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab stated: &quot; “From among the wonders is to find a Sufi who is a &quot;faqih&quot; and a scholar who is an ascetic (&quot;zahid&quot;).” For indeed those who are concerned with the piety of the heart are often associated with a lack of &quot;ma‘rifah&quot;, which would necessitate abstinence from wrong and make &quot;jihad&quot; necessary. And those who are in-depth in knowledge at times mention such wickedness and doubts that place them in err and deviation... So, His love itself is the basis of His worship, and assigning equals (&quot;shirk&quot;) in love is the basis of polytheism in His worship... This is why the &quot;‘arif&quot; Sufi &quot;shaykhs&quot; would advise many to pursue knowledge. Some of them would say: “A person only leaves a single &quot;Sunnah&quot; due to the pride in him.” &quot;

<text>Sankt Wendel is a Kreis (district) in the north of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are Trier-Saarburg, Birkenfeld, Kusel, Neunkirchen, Saarlouis, and Merzig-Wadern.

==History==
The district was created in 1834 when Prussia bought the Principality of Lichtenberg from Saxe-Coburg. After World War I, the Saar area came under special rulership of the League of Nations as the Territory of the Saar Basin, and thus the Sankt Wendel district was split into two parts. The partition of the district remained in place after the Saar territory was reincorporated into Germany in 1935. In 1937 the north-eastern part, the , was merged with the Region of Birkenfeld, formerly an exclave of Oldenburg, forming the Birkenfeld district. After World War II the Saar area was once again detached from Germany, this time as the French Saar Protectorate, which included all of the post-WWI territory plus some additional areas to the north; the eastern parts of this additional territory, most of which had come from the Birkenfeld district, were incorporated into Sankt Wendel. The Saar Protectorate was reincorporated into West Germany in 1956 as the Saarland.

==Geography==
The district is located in the &quot;Saar-Hunsrück&quot; natural area, a hilly area with elevations between 200 and 600 meters.
The main river in the district is the Nahe. The &quot;Bostalsee&quot; is the biggest tourist lake in the south-west of Germany, covering an area of about 1.2 km2.

==Coat of arms==
The German blazon reads: &quot;Im silber und blau geteilten Schild ein rot bezungter und rot bewehrter Löwe mit gewechselten Farben, belegt mit einem goldenen Herzschild, darin eine rote heraldische Lilie.&quot;

The district&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent and azure a lion rampant counterchanged armed and langued gules surmounted by an inescutcheon Or charged with a fleur-de-lis of the third.

The lion charge is actually to be interpreted as a composite of two lions, with the blue part in the upper field representing the charge borne by the Counts of Veldenz, a branch of the House of Wittelsbach, while the silver part in the lower field represents Nassau-Saarbrücken. The two counties had the most important landholds in the district. The inescutcheon (inset shield) in the middle bears a fleur-de-lis charge taken from the town of Sankt Wendel in tinctures drawn from the arms of Lorraine.

<text>The Aikikai is the original school of Aikido. It is centered on the Aikikai Foundation in Japan, and its figurehead is the Doshu (the family heir of the founder of Aikido). It is represented globally through the International Aikido Federation.

== Aikikai Foundation ==
The is the original aikido organization. It has been an incorporated entity in Japan since 1940 under the name , then re-registered under the name &quot;Aikikai&quot; after the ban on Aikido practice was lifted by the GHQ in 1948. It is headed by the doshu, the living successor of the founder of aikido.

The Aikikai Foundation operates Hombu dojo, which is also named Aikido World Headquarters. It is sometimes called the Aikikai Hombu to distinguish it from the headquarters of later aikido organisations. It is located in Tokyo. The term &quot;Hombu&quot; may sometimes be used loosely to refer to the upper echelons of instructors at Hombu dojo, or to the Aikikai Foundation itself.

The Aikikai Foundation also currently manages one satellite dojo, the historical Iwama dojo in Ibaraki (about 100 km northeast of Tokyo).

The Aikikai Foundation sends instructors around Japan on a continual basis. It also issues certificates of grading and instructor titles legitimated by the Doshu throughout the world.

In April 2012, the Aikikai Foundation became a &quot;Public Interest Incorporated Foundation (Japan)&quot;.

== &quot;Dōshu&quot; ==
&quot;Dōshu&quot; (道主 / どうしゅ) literally translates as &#x27;Master of the Way&#x27;. It is the title denoting the head of the Aikikai, although the same term could be used as a title within other disciplines. In Japanese, its most common meaning is specific to the Aikikai Foundation.

The system of having the heir of a martial arts school be the previous headmaster&#x27;s son (either natural or adopted for the sake of succession) was common in &quot;koryū&quot; (traditional schools) and such heirs often are referred to as &quot;iemoto&quot;.
*Founder (開祖 &quot;Kaiso&quot;) Morihei Ueshiba (1883-1969) originated the art of Aikido. Sometimes referred to as &quot;dōshu&quot; during his time, but more commonly known as &quot;O-sensei&quot; (great teacher).
*Second &quot;dōshu&quot; Kisshomaru Ueshiba (1921–1999) took over leadership of the organisation and assumed the title of &quot;dōshu&quot; in 1969 upon the death of his father, the founder. Kisshomaru was the first person in aikido to be widely referred to by the title &quot;dōshu&quot;.
*Third &quot;dōshu&quot; Moriteru Ueshiba (born 1951) is the current holder of the title. Grandson of the founder. Succeeded to the position in 1999 upon the death of his father.

According to the tradition, Moriteru is expected to be succeeded as dōshu by his son, Mitsuteru Ueshiba (born 1981).

== &quot;Hombu Dōjō&quot; ==
The &quot;Hombu Dōjō&quot; in Tokyo is the headquarters of the Aikikai.

The &quot;Hombu Dōjō&quot; is officially named Aikido World Headquarters, and is entirely operated by the Aikikai Foundation. It is sometimes called the Aikikai Hombu to distinguish it from the headquarters of later aikido organisations.

&quot;Hombu Dōjō&quot; has about 30 instructors, and most are shihan. The instructors include the Doshu and Hiroshi Tada 9th dan.

The location of &quot;Hombu Dōjō&quot; is in Wakamatsu-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. (This same location was formerly the Ushigome District of Shinjuku.)

The &quot;dōjō&quot; was established in April 1931 by the founder of Aikido. It was originally named &quot;Kobukan Dōjō&quot; (, imperial warrior training hall) but was called &quot;Hombu Dōjō&quot; after World War II.
In 1967 the original single-story wooden structure was replaced by a five-story modern building. Training takes place in three rooms which total about 250 tatami in area. The main training area has 105 tatami mats (170m2). The other two training areas, containing 72 and 42 tatami mats respectively, are often used for beginner&#x27;s classes, children&#x27;s classes, women&#x27;s classes, or fixed term and enrollment &quot;academy&quot; (&quot;Gakko&quot;) courses.

Classes are held seven days a week. Beginner&#x27;s and regular classes are open to all Aikido practitioners that are or become Aikikai members.

== Aikikai school of Aikido ==

Within Japan, there are about 1800 other training locations affiliated with the Hombu. These are united under the All-Japan Aikido Federation.
Overseas, there are about 100 foreign aikido organisations recognised by the Hombu. These are ostensibly national aikido organisations that each represent many dojos and many students. The gradings of students in these organisations are certified specifically by the Hombu. (The Hombu has procedures for examinations and recommendations of aikido grades and instructor titles, and ideally this ensures a degree of international consistency and serves to prevent local instructors from boastfully exaggerating their own ranks.) However, regardless of recognition, all foreign aikido groups remain organisationally independent from the Aikikai Foundation.

The students of recognised dojo worldwide are loosely referred to collectively as the Aikikai school of aikido, although this &quot;school&quot; is not an official organisation. Their aikido technique may be referred to as Aikikai style, although this encompasses a wider spectrum of technical styles characteristically than later (and smaller) schools of aikido.

== International Aikido Federation ==

The International Aikido Federation was formed in 1976 to serve as the primary global aikido organisation. It is an umbrella organisation with member organisations from more than 40 nations (for example, the All-Japan Aikido Federation is one member). All members must be recognised by the Hombu, so the IAF exclusively represents the Aikikai. The IAF is a nominally democratic organisation but special roles are given to the Doshu and a council of senior instructors, to safeguard the &quot;technical and moral&quot; integrity of aikido. The IAF currently admits only one member organisation per country and gives each such member equal vote (it was modelled on the UN; it does not necessarily give every Aikikai student equal representation).

== Aikikai style of aikido ==
Aikikai is not one style of aikido but instead, encompasses a diversity of technical styles. This is associated with the broad base of first generation instructors, who each had their own interpretation of the art, and other influences. Nonetheless Aikikai is often described as a style for comparison with separate aikido organisations. Aikikai is described as the most traditional; Aikikai has stayed loyal to the Ueshiba house and is sometimes called Ueshiba Aikido. It has retained many of the aspects which Morihei Ueshiba valued, such as the non-competitive training system (as contrasted with Tomiki&#x27;s development). Spiritual interpretations are not emphasised compared to in Ki Society.

Morihei Ueshiba&#x27;s own style evolved significantly over his lifetime. The pre-war &quot;aikibudo&quot; techniques taught by Morihei Ueshiba were generally closer to aikijujutsu whilst flowing technique was more emphasised as he became older, and this is reflected in the aikido of people who studied at different periods in time.

 Seiseki Abe said: &quot;As far as the Aikido [O-Sensei] practiced in his later years, even young girls, old people and children could do [the techniques]. That is a big difference. I suppose you could say that it was a difference in the severity or the strictness of the training. Before the war, it was severity and strong technique, as opposed to the (kind of) techniques that invigorate our partners as we have now.&quot;

Kazuo Chiba has implied that the style of training in Hombu concentrated less on physical rigor because of its demographic: &quot;A large portion of the membership at Iwama Dojo consisted of local farmers, hard workers who spent all day in the fields. They had thick bones and great physical strength, combined with a peculiar local character known as &quot;Mito kishitsu,&quot; a type of manliness close to gallantry.
Altogether, it was quite an opposite culture from Hombu Dojo in Tokyo. Because it is in the capital of Japan, Hombu’s membership consists of white-collar workers, intellectuals, businessmen, politicians and university students.&quot;

It has been noted by aikido researchers affiliated with other styles that many of the senior teachers at the Aikikai spent little time training under Morihei Ueshiba, and that Kisshomaru Ueshiba and Koichi Tohei (and following Tohei&#x27;s departure, Kisaburo Osawa) were largely responsible for the Aikikai curriculum. As a result, it has been argued that the teachings of the Aikikai are derived from those of the second Doshu, Kisshomaru, and that the art promulgated by the Aikikai differs from that taught by the founder, Morihei Ueshiba.

<text>The Tamaulipas crow (Corvus imparatus) is a crow found in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.

== Description ==
It is a relatively small and sleek looking crow, in length. It has very glossy dark, bluish plumage, which appears soft and silky. The bill is quite slender and black, as are the legs and feet. The Chihuahuan raven, a much larger and very different bird, is the only crow it commonly occurs alongside.

==Taxonomy==
The Sinaloa crow (&quot;Corvus sinaloae&quot;) appears to be genetically extremely close to this bird and can be considered the western form of it though the voice is quite different, indeed a third species, the fish crow (&quot;Corvus ossifragus&quot;) of the southeastern United States appears to be very closely related to them also and the three may be considered a superspecies.

==Distribution and habitat==
Occurring in a relatively small area in northeastern Mexico, it inhabits near desert scrub and bushland and includes farms, small towns and villages in its range. It also occurs in more humid woodland in open areas but does not appear to be found in the higher mountains or along the seashore. It is a sociable bird often forming large flocks, moving together in close groups. Its northern range reaches Brownsville in southern Texas where it has been known to nest.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
Food would appear to be mainly insects taken on the ground though eggs and nestlings are taken in trees as well as many fruits and berries.

===Nesting===
The nest is similar to the American crow but smaller and is built in a tree or large bush.

===Voice===
The voice of this crow is unusual and unlike most other species of the genus &quot;Corvus&quot;. It has a low croaking sound rather like a frog and a call that is described as a soft &quot;gar-lik&quot;.

<doc id="219243" wikidata="Q1051051" url="?curid=219243" title="Right to keep and bear arms">
<text>The right to keep and bear arms (often referred to as the right to bear arms) is a legal right for people to possess weapons (arms) for the preservation of life, liberty, and property. The purpose of gun rights is for self-defense, as well as hunting and sporting activities. Countries that guarantee a right to keep and bear arms include Albania, Czech Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, the Philippines, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United States and Yemen.

==Background==

The Bill of Rights 1689 allowed Protestant citizens of England to &quot;have Arms for their Defense suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.&quot; This restricted the ability of the English Crown to have a standing army or to interfere with Protestants&#x27; right to bear arms &quot;when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law&quot; and established that Parliament, not the Crown, could regulate the right to bear arms.

Sir William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the &quot;natural right of resistance and self-preservation&quot; subject to suitability and allowance by law. The term &quot;arms&quot;, as used in the 1600s, refers to the process of equipping for war; it is commonly used as a synonym for weapon.

Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. In 1875, 17 percent of national constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, &quot;the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling&quot;. In an article titled &quot;U.S. Gun Rights Truly Are American Exceptionalism,&quot; a historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789, Tom Ginsburg and colleagues &quot;identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms. Almost all of these constitutions have been in Latin America, and most were from the 19th century&quot;.

==Countries recognizing the right to keep and bear arms==
===North America===
====Guatemala====

While protecting the right to keep arms, Guatemalan constitution specifies that this right extends only to &quot;weapons not prohibited by law&quot;.

====Honduras====
 The constitution of Honduras does not protect the right to keep and bear arms.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the legislation, every person is entitled to receive a license to keep and carry arms by Honduran Statute law, provided that they fulfill the conditions required by the law.

====Mexico====

The Mexican constitution of 1857 first included the right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 revised the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.

Another change was included in 1917 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to statutory authorization in Federal law.

====United States====


In the United States, which has an English common law tradition, a longstanding common-law right to keep and bear arms was practiced prior to the creation of a written national constitution. Today, this right is specifically protected by the United States Constitution and many state constitutions.

===Europe===

====Czech Republic====
 

Historically, the Czech lands were at the forefront of the spreading of civilian firearms ownership. In the 1420s and 1430s, firearms became indispensable tools for the mostly peasant Hussite armies whose amateur combatants, including women, fended off a series of invasions of professional crusader armies of well-armored warriors with cold weapons. Throughout and after the Hussite wars, firearms&#x27; design underwent fast development and their possession by civilians became a matter of course.

Their first firearms regulation was enacted in 1517 as a part of general accord between the nobles and burghers and later in 1524 as a standalone Enactment on Firearms (&quot;zřízení o ručnicích&quot;). The 1517 law explicitly stated that &quot;all people of all standing have the right to keep firearms at home&quot; while at the same time enacting a universal carry ban. The 1524 enactment set out a process of issuing of permits for carrying of firearms and detailed enforcement and punishment for carrying without such a permit. Carrying later became permitless again until 1852, when Imperial Regulation No. 223 reintroduced carry permits. This law remained in force until the 1939 German invasion.

Since its inception during the Hussite revolution, the right to keep firearms endured over five-hundred years until the Nazi gun ban during the German occupation in the 20th century. Firearms possession later became severely restricted during the communist period. After the Velvet revolution, the Czech Republic instated a shall-issue permitting process, under which all residents can keep and bear arms subject to the fulfillment of regulatory conditions.

In the Czech Republic, every resident that meets conditions laid down in Act No. 119/2002 Coll. has the right to have a firearms license issued and can then obtain a firearm. Holders of &quot;D&quot; (exercise of profession) and &quot;E&quot; (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, can carry up to two concealed firearms for protection. The right to be armed is statutorily protected.

A proposal to have the right to keep and bear arms included in the constitution was entered in the Czech Parliament in December 2016. The proposal was approved by vote of 139 to 9 on 28 June 2017 by the Chamber of Deputies. It later failed to reach necessary support in Senate, where only 28 out of 59 Senators present supported it (with constitutional majority being 36 votes). 

A new proposal was entered by 35 Senators in September 2019 and then approved on 21 July 2021, adding a new sentence, according to which &quot;the right to defend one&#x27;s own life or the life of another person even with the use of a weapon is guaranteed under the conditions set by the law.&quot; 
The provision is interpreted as guaranteeing legal accessibility of arms in a way that must ensure possibility of effective self-defense and as constitutional stipulation which underscores the individual right to be prepared with arms against an eventual attack, i.e. that courts cannot draw a negative inference from the fact that a defender had been preparing to avert a possible attack with use of weapons.

====Switzerland====
The Swiss have a statutory right to bear arms under Article 3 of the 1997 Weapons Act. Switzerland practices universal conscription, meaning each Swiss male between the ages of 19 and 24 is conscripted. During the draft, they can choose to serve in the army or the alternative service, and, if they chose military service, following a brief period of active duty will be enrolled in the reserve until 7 or 10 years after their promotion to the rank of private, or an inability to serve, ends their obligation. Until December 2009, these men were required to keep their government-issued selective fire combat rifles and/or semi-automatic handguns in their homes as long as they were enrolled in the armed forces. Since January 2010, they have had the option of depositing their issued firearm at a government arsenal. Until September 2007, soldiers received 50 rounds of government-issued ammunition in a sealed box for storage at home; after 2007 only about 2,000 specialist troops are allowed to keep the military-issued ammunition at home.

In a referendum in February 2011, voters rejected a citizens&#x27; initiative that would have obliged members of the armed services to store their rifles and pistols on military compounds and required that privately owned firearms be registered.
====United Kingdom====


In the United Kingdom, there is no automatic right to bear arms, although citizens may possess certain firearms on obtaining an appropriate licence. Ordinary members of the public may own sporting rifles and shotguns, subject to licensing, while handguns, automatic, and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal to possess without special additional conditions.
When not attended, all licensed firearms must be stored securely (locked) and separate from their ammunition. Regulations for airguns are less stringent and air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding 6 foot-pounds force (8.1 joules) and other airguns with a muzzle energy not exceeding 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) do not require any certificates or licensing, although the same storage requirement applies.
The first serious control on firearms was established with the passing of the Firearms Act 1920, handgun restrictions being added in response to the 1996 Dunblane Massacre in which 18 people died.

Historically the English Bill of Rights 1689 allowed:
Since 1953, it has been a criminal offence in the United Kingdom to carry a knife (with the exception of non-locking folding knives with a cutting edge of 3 inches (7.62 centimetres) or less) or any &quot;offensive weapon&quot; in a public place without lawful authority (e.g. police or security forces) or reasonable excuse (e.g. tools that are needed for work). The cutting edge of a knife is separate to the blade length. The only manner in which an individual may carry arms is on private property or any property to which the public does not have a lawful right of access (e.g., a person&#x27;s own home, private land, the area in a shop where the public have no access, etc.), as the law only creates the offence when it occurs in public. Furthermore, Criminal Justice Act 1988 Section 141 specifically lists all offensive weapons that cannot technically be owned, even on private property, by way of making it illegal to sell, trade, hire, etc. an offensive weapon to another person.

Furthermore, the law does not allow an offensive weapon or ordinary item intended or adapted as an offensive weapon to be carried in public before the threat of violence arises. This would only be acceptable in the eyes of the law if the person armed themselves immediately preceding or during an attack (in a public place). This is known as a &quot;weapon of opportunity&quot; or &quot;instantaneous arming&quot;.

===Other===

====Sharia law====
Under Sharia law, there is an intrinsic freedom to own arms. However, in times of civil strife or internal violence, this right can be temporarily suspended to keep peace and prevent harm, as mentioned by Imam ash-Shatibi in his works on Maqasid ash-Shari&#x27;ah (The Intents and Purposes of Shari&#x27;ah). Citizens not practicing Islam are prohibited from bearing arms and are required to be protected by the military, the state for which they pay the jizyah. In exchange they do not need to pay the zakat.

====Yemen====
Yemen recognizes statutory right to keep and bear arms. Firearms are both easily and legally accessible.

== Gun violence and the politics of the right to bear arms ==

Legal restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators in an attempt to reduce firearm-based violence and crime. Their actions may be the result of political groups advocating for such regulations. The Brady Campaign, Snowdrop Campaign, and the Million Mom March are examples of campaigns calling for tighter restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms. Accident statistics can be hard to obtain, but much data is available on the issue of gun ownership and gun related deaths.

=== United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute ===

The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A &quot;substantial correlation&quot; is seen in both:

UNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high levels of gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that &quot;widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide.&quot; The researchers concluded that &quot;all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a fatal role in this&quot;.

This research found that guns were the major cause of homicides in three of the fourteen countries it studied: Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States. Although some data indicates that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and moderate reductions in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that &quot;reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point,&quot; citing the American example where gun laws remain a subject of heated debate (see also Gun politics in the United States).

A posterior study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. The researchers declared &quot;The results show very strong correlations between the presence of guns in the home and suicide committed with a gun, rates of gun-related homicide involving female victims, and gun-related assault.&quot; There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.

=== Other ===

Some other research indicates that gun levels do not affect the total number of homicides or the total number of suicides, but rather affect the share of homicides or suicides committed with guns.

Public-health critic, gun-rights proponent, and editor-in-chief of &quot;Surgical Neurology International&quot; Miguel Faria contended in 2012 that keeping and bearing arms not only has constitutional protection, but also that firearms have beneficial aspects that have been ignored by the public health establishment in which he played a part. He also contended that guns are beneficial in self-defense, collective defense, and in protecting life and property.

A 2012 study in the journal &quot;Annual Review of Public Health&quot; found that suicide rates are greater in households with firearms than those without them.

<doc id="219246" wikidata="Q663216" url="?curid=219246" title="Matthew Henry">
<text>Matthew Henry (18 October 166222 June 1714) was a British Nonconformist minister and author who was born in Wales but spent much of his life in England. He is best known for the six-volume biblical commentary &quot;Exposition of the Old and New Testaments&quot;.

== Life ==
Matthew Henry was the second son born to Philip and Kathrine Henry. He was born prematurely at his mother&#x27;s family estate, Broad Oak, a farmhouse on the borders of Flintshire and Shropshire. He was baptized the next day by the local parish rector. His father, Philip Henry, a Church of England cleric, had just been ejected under the Act of Uniformity 1662. As a young child, he was frequently afflicted with fevers. Unlike most of those who had been ejected, Philip Henry possessed some private means, and was able to provide his son a good education. Henry&#x27;s sister was diarist Sarah Savage.

=== Early life ===
By the age of nine, Henry was able to write Latin and read part of the Greek New Testament. He was tutored in grammar by William Turner in 1668 who was temporarily staying at Broad Oak. His father provided much of Henry&#x27;s early education at home. Henry practiced writing by copying his father&#x27;s sermons and as a child he exhibited a natural public speaking ability. In 1680, at eighteen, his father sent him to a school in Islington, London to be tutored by the Nonconformist minister Thomas Doolittle. Henry later transferred to Gray&#x27;s Inn, in the heart of the capital, to study law. While at Gray&#x27;s Inn, he also studied French and literature. He soon gave up his legal studies for theology. Henry was invited by his friend George Illidge, to give his first sermon to a congregation at Nantwich. Having been well received he returned to speak two more times that summer.

==== Chester ====
In 1686, he was offered an invitation by a local Nonconformist minister to move to Chester, Cheshire and establish a congregation. He was initially hesitant to accept, not willing to take away members from an already established minister but upon Harvey&#x27;s insistence he accepted. Henry was ordained on 9 May 1687 by a group of six Nonconformist ministers. He presented a paper written in Latin as part of his ordination. He then became minister of a new Presbyterian congregation at Chester. The congregation grew under his leadership and in 1699 he oversaw the construction of a new building. While in Chester, Henry founded the Presbyterian Chapel in Trinity Street. After becoming established in Chester, he began to travel around to nearby cities speaking. He became a member of the local Chester union of ministers. Henry said of living in Chester &quot;I cannot think of leaving Chester, until Chester leaves me.&quot;

After moving to Chester, he married Kathrine Hardware on 19 July 1687, after her mother initially objected to the marriage. Kathrine Hardware&#x27;s parents then moved to Chester and Henry and his wife lived with them. Shortly after the birth of their first child, Kathrine died of smallpox on 14 February 1689, at age 25. He named the infant Kathrine after the mother, but the child died 15 months later. He continued to live with the Hardwares after the death of his wife and continued his ministerial duties.

He was introduced to Mary Warburton, a relative of Mrs. Hardware. On 8 July 1690, he married Mary Warburton in Chester. His second child, Elizabeth was born on 2 April 1691, and died in infancy in July 1692. A third child, born in 1693, died three weeks after birth.

At age 26 in 1688, the number of speaking engagements started to impact his health. He was frequently subject to fevers. A letter from his father instructed him &quot;...in your earnestness [when speaking], keep the reins upon it.&quot; His impassioned speaking style was well-received by his listeners and contributed to his growing popularity. On occasion, he could move his audience to tears. He became a popular speaker and received constant invitations to speak and give lectures. He traveled almost weekly to different cities to speak.

He spent significant amounts of time studying and writing his sermons and lectures in advance. Henry preferred to use an expository speaking style. For each speaking engagement, he would employ different base texts to expand upon his general topic. His approach to teaching was &quot;Choose for your pulpit subjects the plainest, and most needful truths; and endeavor to make them plainer.&quot; When writing, he would remain close to the literal interpretation of biblical passages. These writings would later form the basis on which he developed his commentary.

Between the years of 1687–1712, Matthew Henry continued to live in Chester. In 1694, Esther Henry was born to Matthew Henry and his wife. Esther lived to adulthood. On 24 June 1697 his daughter Ann was born. This child also died in infancy in 1698 in a local measles outbreak. Henry was very saddened at her death. Ann was his fourth child to have died in infancy. Matthew Henry and his wife Mary had their first son in 1700 and named him Philip, who later in life took his mother&#x27;s name, Warburton. Another child, Elizabeth, was born in 1701. In August 1703, he had another daughter; this one he named Sarah after his older sister. Two more children were born who survived to adulthood: Theodosia in 1708 and Mary in 1711.

=== Journey to London ===
In 1698, Henry traveled to London to speak for the first time since moving to Chester. On the trip to London, he made speaking stops in Nantwich, Newcastle, Lichfield and other towns on the way. Towards the end of this time period, he was frequently invited to speak in London where he eventually moved. He traveled to London again to speak in 1704 and this time Mary accompanied him. Up until this time, his health had been quite good despite the pace at which he worked. In August 1704 he fainted while he was speaking but quickly resumed speaking. The next two days he traveled to Nantwich and then to Haslington. Upon his return to Chester, he was bedridden with a fever for three weeks.

=== Hackney ===
He moved again in 1712 to Mare Street, Hackney after accepting an invitation to take over the ministry of the Hackney congregation. He began work there on 18 May 1712 with a congregation of less than one hundred members. He would also travel to Wapping, Rotherhithe and other surrounding areas and give evening lectures before returning to the duties of the Hackney congregation. Henry also began giving catechetical lectures in London. His &quot;Exposition of the Old and New Testaments&quot; was nearing the publication stage and was a contributing motive to the move to Hackney, close to the publisher. In 1713, his health began declining after a return visit to Chester.

=== Death ===
In 1713, he began suffering from frequent attacks of nephritis. He continued to maintain his frequent speaking engagements and work on his commentary. On 21 June 1714 Henry was on a speaking tour around Chester and was returning to Hackney. While en route, he was thrown off his horse but denied injury and insisted on making it to Nantwich where he was scheduled to speak. His traveling companions noted a lack of energy. That evening he could no longer travel and stopped at the Queen&#x27;s Aid House in Nantwich. On 22 June 1714, he went to be with his God, having died of apoplexy.

== Literary work ==

Henry&#x27;s well-known six-volume &quot;Exposition of the Old and New Testaments&quot; (170810) or &quot;Complete Commentary&quot; provides an exhaustive paragraph-by-paragraph (or section-by-section) study of the Bible, covering the whole of the Old Testament, and the Gospels and Acts in the New Testament. Thirteen other non-conformist ministers finished the sixth volume of Romans through Revelation after Henry&#x27;s death, partly based on notes taken by Henry&#x27;s hearers. The entire Commentary was re-edited by George Burder and John Hughes in 1811.

Henry&#x27;s commentaries are primarily theological, dealing with the scripture text as presented, with his prime intention being explanation for practical and devotional purposes, giving a theological commentary on each chapter of Scripture. Henry recommended Matthew Poole&#x27;s &quot;Synopsis Criticorum&quot; for a more technical analysis.

Henry&#x27;s Commentary identifies the &quot;man of sin&quot;, the focus of latter day apostasy, and the Antichrist as the papacy in his interpretation of 2 Thessalonians 2:3. The commentary lists three &quot;blasphemous titles&quot; which it states have been attached to the &quot;bishops of Rome.&quot; This anti-papist passage in the Commentary was not directly authored by Henry, but occurs in the sixth volume on Romans to Revelation, completed posthumously by his 13 friends.

Famous evangelical Protestant preachers used and heartily commended the work, such as George Whitefield and Charles Spurgeon, with Whitefield reading it through four timesthe last time on his knees. Spurgeon stated, &quot;Every minister ought to read it entirely and carefully through once at least.&quot; John Wesley published an abbreviated edition of the Commentary and wrote of Henry:
He is allowed by all competent judges, to have been a person of strong understanding, of various learning, of solid piety, and much experience in the ways of God. And his exposition is generally clear and intelligible, the thoughts being expressed in plain words: It is also found, agreeable to the tenor of scripture, and to the analogy of faith. It is frequently full, giving a sufficient explication of the passages which require explaining. It is in many parts deep, penetrating farther into the inspired writings than most other comments do. It does not entertain us with vain speculations, but is practical throughout: and usually spiritual too teaching us how to worship God, not in form only, but in spirit and in truth. 
Several abbreviated editions of the Commentary were published in the twentieth century; more recently, Martin H. Manser edited &quot;The New Matthew Henry Commentary: The Classic Work with Updated Language&quot;.

== Quotations ==
Perhaps his best-known quotation is about the relationship between men and women, from the story of the creation of Eve, in the Book of Genesis:The woman was made of a rib out of the side of Adam; not made out of his head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be beloved.
The quote is inspired by the words of Peter Lombard in his book &quot;Sentences&quot;:She {Eve} was formed not from just any part of his body {Adam’s body}, but from his side, so that it should be shown that she was created for the partnership of love, lest, if perhaps she had been made from his head, she should be perceived as set over man in domination; or if from his feet, as if subject to him in servitude. Therefore, since she was made neither to dominate, nor to serve the man, but as his partner, she had to be produced neither from his head, nor from his feet, but from his side, so that he would know that she was to be placed beside himself.

== Memorial ==

In 1860, a memorial was erected in Chester to commemorate Henry. This consists of an obelisk designed by Thomas Harrison that incorporates a bronze medallion by Matthew Noble. The obelisk originally stood in the churchyard of StBridget&#x27;s Church, and was moved in the 1960s to stand on a roundabout opposite the entrance to Chester Castle.

<doc id="219249" wikidata="Q164142" url="?curid=219249" title="Protectorate">
<text>A protectorate, in the context of international relations, is a state that is under protection by another state for defence against aggression and other violations of law. It is a dependent territory that enjoys autonomy over most of its internal affairs, while still recognizing the suzerainty of a more powerful sovereign state without being a possession. In exchange, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations depending on the terms of their arrangement. Usually protectorates are established de jure by a treaty. Under certain conditions—as with Egypt under British rule (1882–1914)—a state can also be labelled as a de facto protectorate or a veiled protectorate.

A protectorate is different from a colony as it has local rulers, is not directly possessed, and rarely experiences colonization by the suzerain state. A state that is under the protection of another state while retaining its &quot;international personality&quot; is called a &quot;protected state&quot;, not a protectorate.

==History==
Protectorates are one of the oldest features of international relations, dating back to the Roman Empire. &quot;Civitates foederatae&quot; were cities that were subordinate to Rome for their foreign relations. In the Middle Ages, Andorra was a protectorate of France and Spain. Modern protectorate concepts were devised in the nineteenth century.

==Typology==
===Foreign relations===
In practice, a protectorate often has direct foreign relations only with the protector state, and transfers the management of all its more important international affairs to the latter. Similarly, the protectorate rarely takes military action on its own but relies on the protector for its defence. This is distinct from annexation, in that the protector has no formal power to control the internal affairs of the protectorate.

Protectorates differ from League of Nations mandates and their successors, United Nations trust territories, whose administration is supervised, in varying degrees, by the international community. A protectorate formally enters into the protection through a bilateral agreement with the protector, while international mandates are stewarded by the world community-representing body, with or without a administering power.

===Protected state===
A protected state has a form of protection where it continues to retain an &quot;international personality&quot; and enjoys an agreed amount of independence in conducting its foreign policy.

For political and pragmatic reasons, the protection relationship is not usually advertised, but described with euphemisms such as &quot;an independent state with special treaty relations&quot; with the protecting state. A protected state appears on world maps just as any other independent state.

International administration of a state can also be regarded as an internationalized form of protection, where the protector is an international organisation rather than a state.

===Colonial protection===
Multiple regions—such as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria, the Colony and Protectorate of Lagos, and similar—were subjects of colonial protection. Conditions of protection are generally much less generous for areas of colonial protection. The protectorate was often reduced to a condition similar to a colony, but with the pre-existing native state continuing as the agent of indirect rule. Occasionally, a protectorate was established by another form of indirect rule: a chartered company, which becomes a state in its European home state (but geographically overseas), allowed to be an independent country with its own foreign policy and generally its own armed forces.

In fact, protectorates were often declared despite no agreement being duly entered into by the state supposedly being protected, or only agreed to by a party of dubious authority in those states. Colonial protectors frequently decided to reshuffle several protectorates into a new, artificial unit without consulting the protectorates, without being mindful of the theoretical duty of a protector to help maintain a protectorate&#x27;s status and integrity. The Berlin agreement of February 26, 1885, allowed European colonial powers to establish protectorates in Black Africa (the last region to be divided among them) by diplomatic notification, even without actual possession on the ground. This aspect of history is referred to as the Scramble for Africa. A similar case is the formal use of such terms as &quot;colony&quot; and &quot;protectorate&quot; for an amalgamation—convenient only for the colonizer or protector—of adjacent territories, over which it held () sway by protective or &quot;raw&quot; colonial power.

===Amical protection===
In amical protection—as of United States of the Ionian Islands by Britain—the terms are often very favourable for the protectorate. The political interest of the protector is frequently moral (a matter of accepted moral obligation, prestige, ideology, internal popularity, or dynastic, historical, or ethnocultural ties). Also, the protector&#x27;s interest is in countering a rival or enemy power—such as preventing the rival from obtaining or maintaining control of areas of strategic importance. This may involve a very weak protectorate surrendering control of its external relations but may not constitute any real sacrifice, as the protectorate may not have been able to have a similar use of them without the protector&#x27;s strength.

Amical protection was frequently extended by the great powers to other Christian (generally European) states, and to states of no significant importance. After 1815, non-Christian states (such as the Chinese Qing dynasty) also provided amical protection of other, much weaker states.

In modern times, a form of amical protection can be seen as an important or defining feature of microstates. According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): &quot;microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints&quot;.

==France&#x27;s protectorates and protected states==
===Africa===
&quot;Protection&quot; was the formal legal structure under which French colonial forces expanded in Africa between the 1830s and 1900. Almost every pre-existing state that was later part of French West Africa was placed under protectorate status at some point, although direct rule gradually replaced protectorate agreements. Formal ruling structures, or fictive recreations of them, were largely retained—as with the low-level authority figures in the French Cercles—with leaders appointed and removed by French officials.

==United States&#x27; protectorates and protected states==
After becoming independent nations in 1902 and 1903 respectively, Cuba and Panama became protectorates of the United States. In 1903, Cuba and the U.S. signed the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations, which affirmed the provisions of the Platt Amendment, including that the U.S. had the right to intervene in Cuba to preserve its independence, among other reasons (the Platt Amendment had also been integrated into the 1901 constitution of Cuba). Later that year, Panama and the U.S. signed the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which established the Panama Canal Zone and gave the U.S. the right to intervene in the cities of Panama and Colón (and the adjacent territories and harbors) for the maintenance of public order. The 1904 constitution of Panama, in Article 136, also gave the U.S. the right to intervene in any part of Panama &quot;to reestablish public peace and constitutional order.&quot; Haiti later also became a protectorate after the ratification of the Haitian–American Convention (which gave the U.S. the right to intervene in Haiti for a period of ten years, which was later expanded to twenty years through an additional agreement in 1917) on September 16, 1915.

The U.S. also attempted to establish protectorates over the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua through the Bryan–Chamorro Treaty.

Some agencies of the United States government, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, refer to the District of Columbia and insular areas of the United States—such as American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands—as protectorates. However, the agency responsible for the administration of those areas, the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) within the United States Department of Interior, uses only the term &quot;insular area&quot; rather than protectorate.

<text>The Sinaloa crow (Corvus sinaloae) is a crow native to western Mexico.
==Description==
Visually, it is nearly identical to and the same length (34–38 cm) as the Tamaulipas crow (&quot;Corvus imparatus&quot;). It has the same purple-glossed, silky, black plumage with a black bill, legs, and feet. The two species differ markedly in voice.
==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs on the Pacific slope from southern Sonora south to Manzanillo. The crow inhabits coastal regions where it forages on the seashore, semi-desert, open woodlands, river banks and hills up to 300 metres or more. It is very common around coastal towns and villages.
==Diet==
Food is taken both on the ground and in trees. On the seashore it can be found turning over objects to find its food and it will take a wide range of invertebrates such as small shellfish, crabs, and insects. Fruits of many types are also taken and eggs and nestlings are also on the menu when opportunity arises.
==Breeding==
Often, this bird will nest in a thorny tree or a tall coconut palm where its nest is said to be similar to the American crow though smaller.
==Voice==
The voice is radically different from the Tamaulipas crow in that it is quite high-pitched, jay-like, and clear: &quot;ceow&quot;. That of the Tamaulipas crow is a surprisingly low, gruff, frog-like croak.

<text>Eugen Ritter von Böhm-Bawerk (; born Eugen Böhm, 12 February 1851 – 27 August 1914) was an Austrian economist who made important contributions to the development of macroeconomics and to the Austrian School of Economics. He served intermittently as the Minister of Finance of Austria between 1895 and 1904. Böhm-Bawerk is also noted for writing extensive criticisms of Marxism.

==Biography==

Eugen Böhm was born on 12 February 1851 in Brno (), Moravia, Austrian Empire. While studying to be a lawyer at the University of Vienna, Böhm-Bawerk read Carl Menger&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; and became an adherent of his theories, although he never studied under him. Joseph Schumpeter saw Böhm-Bawerk as &quot;so completely the enthusiastic disciple of Menger that it is hardly necessary to look for other influences.&quot; During his time at the Vienna University, he became good friends with Friedrich von Wieser, who later became his brother-in-law. After Vienna, he studied political economy and social science at the universities of Heidelberg, Leipzig and Jena, under Karl Knies, Wilhelm Roscher and Bruno Hildebrand.

After completing his studies in 1872, he entered the Austrian Ministry of Finance, holding various posts until 1880, when he became qualified as a Privatdozent of political economy at Vienna. The following year, however, he transferred his services to the University of Innsbruck, where he remained until 1889, becoming a professor in 1884. During this time, he published the first two out of the three volumes of his masterpiece, &quot;Capital and Interest.&quot;

In 1889 Böhm-Bawerk became a counsellor in the Ministry of Finance in Vienna and represented the government in the lower house on all questions of taxation. He drafted a proposal for direct-tax reform. The Austrian system at the time taxed production heavily, especially during wartime, which resulted in huge disincentives to investment. Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s proposal called for a modern income tax, which was soon approved and met with success in the next few years.

Böhm-Bawerk briefly became Austrian Minister of Finance in 1895. After a second brief period in the position, after his third appointment to the post he remained in it from 1900 to 1904. There he fought continually for strict maintenance of the legally fixed gold standard and a balanced budget. In 1902 he eliminated the sugar subsidy, which had been a feature of the Austrian economy for nearly two centuries. He finally resigned in 1904, when increased fiscal demands from the army threatened to unbalance the budget. The economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron criticized his &quot;penny pinching, &#x27;not-one-heller-more policies&#x27;,&quot; and criticised Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s unwillingness to spend heavily on public works. Joseph Schumpeter praised Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s efforts toward &quot;the financial stability of the country.&quot; His image appeared on the one-hundred schilling banknote from 1984 until the euro was introduced in 2002.

In 1897, Böhm-Bawerk became Ambassador to the German court. In 1899, he was elevated to the upper chamber (House of Peers). In 1907 he became vice-president and in 1911 president of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (Academy of Sciences).

He wrote extensive critiques of Karl Marx&#x27;s economics in the 1880s and 1890s, and several prominent Marxists—including Rudolf Hilferding—attended his seminar in 1905–06. He returned to teaching in 1904, with a chair at the University of Vienna. His many students there included Joseph Schumpeter, Ludwig von Mises and Henryk Grossman. He died in 1914.

George Reisman has called him the second most important Austrian economist &quot;after Ludwig von Mises.&quot; And further:

[It&#x27;s] entirely conceivable to me that Mises might have described Böhm-Bawerk as the most important Austrian economist.

==Published work==
The first volume of &quot;Capital und Capitalzins&quot; (&quot;Capital and Interest&quot;), which Ludwig von Mises decreed to be &quot;the most eminent contribution to modern economic theory,&quot; was entitled &quot;Geschichte und Kritik der Capitalzinstheorien&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;History and Critique of Interest Theories&quot;, translated in 1890 as &quot;A Critical History of Economical Theory&quot;) (Universitätsverlag Wagner, 1884). It is an exhaustive study of the alternative treatments of interest: use theories, productivity theories, abstinence theories, and so on.

Included is a critique of Marx&#x27;s exploitation theory. Böhm-Bawerk argued that capitalists do not exploit their workers; they actually help employees by providing them with an income well in advance of the revenue from the goods they produce, stating, &quot;Labor cannot increase its share at the expense of capital.&quot; In particular, he argued that the Marxist theory of exploitation ignores the dimension of time in production, which he discussed in his theory of roundaboutness, and that a redistribution of profits from capitalist industries will undermine the importance of the interest rate as a vital tool for monetary policy. From this criticism it follows, according to Böhm-Bawerk, that the whole value of a product is not produced by the worker, but that labor can only be paid at the present value of any foreseeable output.

&quot;Karl Marx and the Close of His System&quot; (1896) examined Marx&#x27;s analysis of value, claiming the basic error in Marx&#x27;s system to have resulted from a self-contradiction of Marx&#x27;s law of value, namely how the rate of profit and the prices of production of the third volume of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot; contradict Marx&#x27;s theory of value in the first volume. He also attacks Marx for downplaying the influence of supply and demand in determining permanent price, and for deliberate ambiguity with such concepts.

In the first chapter of the first volume of Capital, Karl Marx explained that the value of any commodity was generally reflected by the quantity of labor required, inequality being only a temporary exception. This therefore means that the level of value generated is completely independent of the quantity of capital of a company. In other words, the organic composition of capital (i.e. the ratio between the quantity of capital and the quantity of labor) of a company has no impact on the profits generated. However, the Marxist economist Conrad Schmidt statistically demonstrates that the level of profit is proportional to the quantity of capital of the company. Faced with this paradox, Karl Marx explains in the third volume of Capital that after production, capitalists will reallocate their capital towards companies having made the highest rates of surplus value until the rate of surplus value stabilizes for all companies in a sector of production (since capital is not a source of value and therefore of profit for Marx). Thus, the prices of goods will go from &#x27;induced&#x27; by the value of labor to &quot;price of production&quot; (the sum of wages and annual profits), &quot;The value and price of the commodity coincide only accidentally and exceptionally.&quot; However, Böhm-Bawerk points out the contradiction formulated with the relation between the value and the price of the good in the first volume, thus, the Marxist theory appears contradictory and the labor theory of value illogical.

Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s &quot;Positive Theorie des Kapitals&quot; (Universitätsverlag Wagner, 1889) (translated by William Smart as &quot;Positive Theory of Capital&quot; (1892)), offered as the second volume of &quot;Capital and Interest&quot;, elaborated on the economy&#x27;s time-consuming production processes and the interest payments they entail. &quot;Further Essays on Capital and Interest&quot; (1921) was the third volume, which originated with appendices to the second volume. Book III (part of the second volume), &quot;Value and Price&quot;, develops Menger&#x27;s ideas of marginal utility outlined in his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, to argue that the idea of subjective value is related to marginalism, in that things only have value insofar as people want such goods. To illustrate the principle, Böhm-Bawerk used the practical example of a farmer who is left with five sacks of corn after harvest to provide for his needs until the next harvest:

Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s critique of Marx&#x27;s theories was criticized by Marxian economist Nikolai Bukharin. In his &quot;Economic Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1927), Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s axiomatic assumptions of individual freedom in his subjectivist theories are fallacious in that economic phenomena can only be understood under the prism of a coherent, contextualised, and historical analysis of society, such as Marx&#x27;s. By contrast, Austrian economists have regarded his critique of Marx as definitive.

Many of Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s works were brought out in the United States by the Chicago industrialist and avid libertarian Frederick Nymeyer, through Libertarian Press, the US arm of the Austrian School of Economics.

Between 1880 and 1947 Böhm-Bawerk worked on the imputation theory first explained by Carl Menger between 1840 and 1921. It states that factor prices are determined by output prices. Böhm-Bawerk provided a variation of the theory that targeted the entrepreneurs, breaking up into three cases: 1. where the factor combination a + b exists such that neither a nor b as isolated piece produces any value at all. Thus if a or b were to be a loss, the other part of the &quot;group&quot; becomes wholly valueless. This implies that every factor can have the value of the whole group or alternatively can have no value (Kauder 179). 2. Where the combination a + b + c exists such that every piece has alternatively two values with a low utility or a lower utility. Then the two values are considered the maximum and minimum. Where a maximum is the group value and the minimum is the value of each individual entity being utilized separately. &quot;Assume that the remaining glove can be used for polishing silverware. Then the maximum is the value of the whole pair minus the use as a polisher, and the minimum is the value as a polisher&quot; (Kauder 179). 3. This just states how two complementary goods can find employment outside the original combination and the original combination can be preserved by replacing productive elements, which have been lost with other factors.

<text>Population genetics is a subfield of genetics that deals with genetic differences within and among populations, and is a part of evolutionary biology. Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation, speciation, and population structure.

Population genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis. Its primary founders were Sewall Wright, J. B. S. Haldane and Ronald Fisher, who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quantitative genetics. Traditionally a highly mathematical discipline, modern population genetics encompasses theoretical, laboratory, and field work. Population genetic models are used both for statistical inference from DNA sequence data and for proof/disproof of concept.

What sets population genetics apart from newer, more phenotypic approaches to modelling evolution, such as evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics, is its emphasis on such genetic phenomena as dominance, epistasis, the degree to which genetic recombination breaks linkage disequilibrium, and the random phenomena of mutation and genetic drift. This makes it appropriate for comparison to population genomics data.

==History==

Population genetics began as a reconciliation of Mendelian inheritance and biostatistics models. Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural or sexual selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. According to this principle, the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.

The next key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot;, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change allele frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, worked out the mathematics of allele frequency change at a single gene locus under a broad range of conditions. Haldane also applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as peppered moth evolution and industrial melanism, and showed that selection coefficients could be larger than Fisher assumed, leading to more rapid adaptive evolution as a camouflage strategy following increased pollution.

The American biologist Sewall Wright, who had a background in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, and the effects of inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932 Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks.

The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked. John Maynard Smith was Haldane&#x27;s pupil, whilst W. D. Hamilton was influenced by the writings of Fisher. The American George R. Price worked with both Hamilton and Maynard Smith. American Richard Lewontin and Japanese Motoo Kimura were influenced by Wright and Haldane.

===Modern synthesis===
The mathematics of population genetics were originally developed as the beginning of the modern synthesis. Authors such as Beatty have asserted that population genetics defines the core of the modern synthesis. For the first few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists continued to believe that Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. During the modern synthesis, these ideas were purged, and only evolutionary causes that could be expressed in the mathematical framework of population genetics were retained. Consensus was reached as to which evolutionary factors might influence evolution, but not as to the relative importance of the various factors.

Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan&#x27;s lab, had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot;. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. Many more biologists were influenced by population genetics via Dobzhansky than were able to read the highly mathematical works in the original.

In Great Britain E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to empirically demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford&#x27;s work, in collaboration with Fisher, contributed to a shift in emphasis during the modern synthesis towards natural selection as the dominant force.

===Neutral theory and origin-fixation dynamics===

The original, modern synthesis view of population genetics assumes that mutations provide ample raw material, and focuses only on the change in frequency of alleles within populations. The main processes influencing allele frequencies are natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow and recurrent mutation. Fisher and Wright had some fundamental disagreements about the relative roles of selection and drift.
The availability of molecular data on all genetic differences led to the neutral theory of molecular evolution. In this view, many mutations are deleterious and so never observed, and most of the remainder are neutral, i.e. are not under selection. With the fate of each neutral mutation left to chance (genetic drift), the direction of evolutionary change is driven by which mutations occur, and so cannot be captured by models of change in the frequency of (existing) alleles alone.

The origin-fixation view of population genetics generalizes this approach beyond strictly neutral mutations, and sees the rate at which a particular change happens as the product of the mutation rate and the fixation probability.

==Four processes==

===Selection===
Natural selection, which includes sexual selection, is the fact that some traits make it more likely for an organism to survive and reproduce. Population genetics describes natural selection by defining fitness as a propensity or probability of survival and reproduction in a particular environment. The fitness is normally given by the symbol w=1-s where s is the selection coefficient. Natural selection acts on phenotypes, so population genetic models assume relatively simple relationships to predict the phenotype and hence fitness from the allele at one or a small number of loci. In this way, natural selection converts differences in the fitness of individuals with different phenotypes into changes in allele frequency in a population over successive generations.

Before the advent of population genetics, many biologists doubted that small differences in fitness were sufficient to make a large difference to evolution. Population geneticists addressed this concern in part by comparing selection to genetic drift. Selection can overcome genetic drift when s is greater than 1 divided by the effective population size. When this criterion is met, the probability that a new advantageous mutant becomes fixed is approximately equal to 2s. The time until fixation of such an allele is approximately formula_1.

====Dominance====

Dominance means that the phenotypic and/or fitness effect of one allele at a locus depends on which allele is present in the second copy for that locus. Consider three genotypes at one locus, with the following fitness values

s is the selection coefficient and h is the dominance coefficient. The value of h yields the following information:

====Epistasis====
Epistasis means that the phenotypic and/or fitness effect of an allele at one locus depends on which alleles are present at other loci. Selection does not act on a single locus, but on a phenotype that arises through development from a complete genotype. However, many population genetics models of sexual species are &quot;single locus&quot; models, where the fitness of an individual is calculated as the product of the contributions from each of its loci—effectively assuming no epistasis.

In fact, the genotype to fitness landscape is more complex. Population genetics must either model this complexity in detail, or capture it by some simpler average rule. Empirically, beneficial mutations tend to have a smaller fitness benefit when added to a genetic background that already has high fitness: this is known as diminishing returns epistasis. When deleterious mutations also have a smaller fitness effect on high fitness backgrounds, this is known as &quot;synergistic epistasis&quot;. However, the effect of deleterious mutations tends on average to be very close to multiplicative, or can even show the opposite pattern, known as &quot;antagonistic epistasis&quot;.

Synergistic epistasis is central to some theories of the purging of mutation load and to the evolution of sexual reproduction.

===Mutation===

The genetic process of mutation takes place within an individual, resulting in heritable changes to the genetic material. This process is often characterized by a description of the starting and ending states, or the kind of change that has happened at the level of DNA (e.g. a T-to-C mutation, a 1-bp deletion), of genes or proteins (e.g., a null mutation, a loss-of-function mutation), or at a higher phenotypic level (e.g., red-eye mutation). Single-nucleotide changes are frequently the most common type of mutation, but many other types of mutation are possible, and they occur at widely varying rates that may show systematic asymmetries or biases (mutation bias).
Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination. This leads to copy-number variation within a population. Duplications are a major source of raw material for evolving new genes. Other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding DNA.

In the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) for new mutations, only a minority of mutations are beneficial. Mutations with gross effects are typically deleterious. Studies in the fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70 percent of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. 
This biological process of mutation is represented in population-genetic models in one of two ways, either as a deterministic pressure of recurrent mutation on allele frequencies, or a source of variation. In deterministic theory, evolution begins with a predetermined set of alleles and proceeds by shifts in continuous frequencies, as if the population is infinite. The occurrence of mutations in individuals is represented by a population-level &quot;force&quot; or &quot;pressure&quot; of mutation, i.e., the force of innumerable events of mutation with a scaled magnitude u applied to shifting frequencies f(A1) to f(A2). For instance, in the classic mutation–selection balance model, the force of mutation pressure pushes the frequency of an allele upward, and selection against its deleterious effects pushes the frequency downward, so that a balance is reached at equilibrium, given (in the simplest case) by f = u/s.

This concept of mutation pressure is mostly useful for considering the implications of deleterious mutation, such as the mutation load and its implications for the evolution of the mutation rate. Transformation of populations by mutation pressure is unlikely. Haldane argued that it would require high mutation rates unopposed by selection, and Kimura concluded even more pessimistically that even this was unlikely, as the process would take too long (see evolution by mutation pressure).
However, evolution by mutation pressure is possible under some circumstances and has long been suggested as a possible cause for the loss of unused traits. 
For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. An experimental example involves the loss of sporulation in experimental populations of &quot;B. subtilis&quot;. Sporulation is a complex trait encoded by many loci, such that the mutation rate for loss of the trait was estimated as an unusually high value, formula_2. Loss of sporulation in this case can occur by recurrent mutation, without requiring selection for the loss of sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation than by genetic drift.
The role of mutation as a source of novelty is different from these classical models of mutation pressure. 
When population-genetic models include a rate-dependent process of mutational introduction or origination, i.e., a process that introduces new alleles including neutral and beneficial ones, then the properties of mutation may have a more direct impact on the rate and direction of evolution, even if the rate of mutation is very low. That is, the spectrum of mutation may become very important, particularly mutation biases, predictable differences in the rates of occurrence for different types of mutations, because bias in the introduction of variation can impose biases on the course of evolution.

Mutation plays a key role in other classical and recent theories including Muller%27s ratchet, subfunctionalization, Eigen&#x27;s concept of an error catastrophe and Lynch&#x27;s mutational hazard hypothesis.

===Genetic drift===
&quot;Genetic drift&quot; is a change in allele frequencies caused by random sampling. That is, the alleles in the offspring are a random sample of those in the parents. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely, and thereby reduce genetic variability. In contrast to natural selection, which makes gene variants more common or less common depending on their reproductive success, the changes due to genetic drift are not driven by environmental or adaptive pressures, and are equally likely to make an allele more common as less common.

The effect of genetic drift is larger for alleles present in few copies than when an allele is present in many copies. The population genetics of genetic drift are described using either branching processes or a diffusion equation describing changes in allele frequency. These approaches are usually applied to the Wright-Fisher and Moran models of population genetics. Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after t generations in many replicated populations, starting with allele frequencies of p and q, the variance in allele frequency across those populations is

Ronald Fisher held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. No population genetics perspective have ever given genetic drift a central role by itself, but some have made genetic drift important in combination with another non-selective force. The shifting balance theory of Sewall Wright held that the combination of population structure and genetic drift was important. Motoo Kimura&#x27;s neutral theory of molecular evolution claims that most genetic differences within and between populations are caused by the combination of neutral mutations and genetic drift.

The role of genetic drift by means of sampling error in evolution has been criticized by John H Gillespie and Will Provine, who argue that selection on linked sites is a more important stochastic force, doing the work traditionally ascribed to genetic drift by means of sampling error. The mathematical properties of genetic draft are different from those of genetic drift. The direction of the random change in allele frequency is autocorrelated across generations.

===Gene flow===

Because of physical barriers to migration, along with the limited tendency for individuals to move or spread (), and tendency to remain or come back to natal place (philopatry), natural populations rarely all interbreed as may be assumed in theoretical random models (panmixy). There is usually a geographic range within which individuals are more closely related to one another than those randomly selected from the general population. This is described as the extent to which a population is genetically structured.

Genetic structuring can be caused by migration due to historical climate change, species range expansion or current availability of habitat. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even human-made structures such as the Great Wall of China, which has hindered the flow of plant genes.

Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations or species, breaking down the structure. Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and then breeding of organisms, or the exchange of pollen. Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Population genetic models can be used to identify which populations show significant genetic isolation from one another, and to reconstruct their history.

Subjecting a population to isolation leads to inbreeding depression. Migration into a population can introduce new genetic variants, potentially contributing to evolutionary rescue. If a significant proportion of individuals or gametes migrate, it can also change allele frequencies, e.g. giving rise to migration load.

In the presence of gene flow, other barriers to hybridization between two diverging populations of an outcrossing species are required for the populations to become new species.

====Horizontal gene transfer====

Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among prokaryotes. In medicine, this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and the adzuki bean beetle &quot;Callosobruchus chinensis&quot; may also have occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which appear to have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi, and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains. Large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and prokaryotes, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria.

==Linkage==

If all genes are in linkage equilibrium, the effect of an allele at one locus can be averaged across the gene pool at other loci. In reality, one allele is frequently found in linkage disequilibrium with genes at other loci, especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome. Recombination breaks up this linkage disequilibrium too slowly to avoid genetic hitchhiking, where an allele at one locus rises to high frequency because it is linked to an allele under selection at a nearby locus. Linkage also slows down the rate of adaptation, even in sexual populations. The effect of linkage disequilibrium in slowing down the rate of adaptive evolution arises from a combination of the Hill–Robertson effect (delays in bringing beneficial mutations together) and background selection (delays in separating beneficial mutations from deleterious hitchhikers).

Linkage is a problem for population genetic models that treat one gene locus at a time. It can, however, be exploited as a method for detecting the action of natural selection via selective sweeps.

In the extreme case of an asexual population, linkage is complete, and population genetic equations can be derived and solved in terms of a travelling wave of genotype frequencies along a simple fitness landscape. Most microbes, such as bacteria, are asexual. The population genetics of their adaptation have two contrasting regimes. When the product of the beneficial mutation rate and population size is small, asexual populations follow a &quot;successional regime&quot; of origin-fixation dynamics, with adaptation rate strongly dependent on this product. When the product is much larger, asexual populations follow a &quot;concurrent mutations&quot; regime with adaptation rate less dependent on the product, characterized by clonal interference and the appearance of a new beneficial mutation before the last one has fixed.

==Applications==

===Explaining levels of genetic variation===
Neutral theory predicts that the level of nucleotide diversity in a population will be proportional to the product of the population size and the neutral mutation rate. The fact that levels of genetic diversity vary much less than population sizes do is known as the &quot;paradox of variation&quot;. While high levels of genetic diversity were one of the original arguments in favor of neutral theory, the paradox of variation has been one of the strongest arguments against neutral theory.

It is clear that levels of genetic diversity vary greatly within a species as a function of local recombination rate, due to both genetic hitchhiking and background selection. Most current solutions to the paradox of variation invoke some level of selection at linked sites. For example, one analysis suggests that larger populations have more selective sweeps, which remove more neutral genetic diversity. A negative correlation between mutation rate and population size may also contribute.

Life history affects genetic diversity more than population history does, e.g. r-strategists have more genetic diversity.

===Detecting selection===

Population genetics models are used to infer which genes are undergoing selection. One common approach is to look for regions of high linkage disequilibrium and low genetic variance along the chromosome, to detect recent selective sweeps.

A second common approach is the McDonald–Kreitman test which compares the amount of variation within a species (polymorphism) to the divergence between species (substitutions) at two types of sites; one assumed to be neutral. Typically, synonymous sites are assumed to be neutral. Genes undergoing positive selection have an excess of divergent sites relative to polymorphic sites. The test can also be used to obtain a genome-wide estimate of the proportion of substitutions that are fixed by positive selection, α. According to the neutral theory of molecular evolution, this number should be near zero. High numbers have therefore been interpreted as a genome-wide falsification of neutral theory.

===Demographic inference===

The simplest test for population structure in a sexually reproducing, diploid species, is to see whether genotype frequencies follow Hardy-Weinberg proportions as a function of allele frequencies. For example, in the simplest case of a single locus with two alleles denoted A and a at frequencies &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, random mating predicts freq(AA) = &quot;p&quot;2 for the AA homozygotes, freq(aa) = &quot;q&quot;2 for the aa homozygotes, and freq(Aa) = 2&quot;pq&quot; for the heterozygotes. In the absence of population structure, Hardy-Weinberg proportions are reached within 1–2 generations of random mating. More typically, there is an excess of homozygotes, indicative of population structure. The extent of this excess can be quantified as the inbreeding coefficient, F.

Individuals can be clustered into &quot;K&quot; subpopulations. The degree of population structure can then be calculated using FST, which is a measure of the proportion of genetic variance that can be explained by population structure. Genetic population structure can then be related to geographic structure, and genetic admixture can be detected.

Coalescent theory relates genetic diversity in a sample to demographic history of the population from which it was taken. It normally assumes neutrality, and so sequences from more neutrally evolving portions of genomes are therefore selected for such analyses. It can be used to infer the relationships between species (phylogenetics), as well as the population structure, demographic history (e.g. population bottlenecks, population growth), biological dispersal, source–sink dynamics and introgression within a species.

Another approach to demographic inference relies on the allele frequency spectrum.

===Evolution of genetic systems===

By assuming that there are loci that control the genetic system itself, population genetic models are created to describe the evolution of dominance and other forms of robustness, the evolution of sexual reproduction and recombination rates, the evolution of mutation rates, the evolution of evolutionary capacitors, the evolution of costly signalling traits, the evolution of ageing, and the evolution of co-operation. For example, most mutations are deleterious, so the optimal mutation rate for a species may be a trade-off between the damage from a high deleterious mutation rate and the metabolic costs of maintaining systems to reduce the mutation rate, such as DNA repair enzymes.

One important aspect of such models is that selection is only strong enough to purge deleterious mutations and hence overpower mutational bias towards degradation if the selection coefficient s is greater than the inverse of the effective population size. This is known as the drift barrier and is related to the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. Drift barrier theory predicts that species with large effective population sizes will have highly streamlined, efficient genetic systems, while those with small population sizes will have bloated and complex genomes containing for example introns and transposable elements. However, somewhat paradoxically, species with large population sizes might be so tolerant to the consequences of certain types of errors that they evolve higher error rates, e.g. in transcription and translation, than small populations.

<doc id="219270" wikidata="Q4899113" url="?curid=219270" title="Between Time and Timbuktu">
<text>Between Time and Timbuktu is a television film directed by Fred Barzyk and based on a number of works by Kurt Vonnegut. Produced by National Educational Television and WGBH-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, it was telecast March 13, 1972 as a NET Playhouse special. The television script was also published in book form in 1972, illustrated with photographs by Jill Krementz and stills from the production.

The first draft of the script was written by David Odell, with contributions from Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding, and the film&#x27;s director. Vonnegut himself served as an &quot;advisor and contributor to the script.&quot; The primary title refers to a collection of poetry written by one of the main characters in Vonnegut&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;.

==Plot==
Stony Stevenson, a young poet living with his mother, receives notice on nation-wide TV that he has won the grand prize in the Blast-Off Space Food jingle contest. The prize is a trip on the Prometheus-5 rocket into the Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum. TV reporter Walter Gesundheit and ex-astronaut Bud Williams, Jr. explain that Stevenson was chosen for this mission because it is believed that only a poet could find the words to describe the Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum, a type of time warp, which may hold the answer to all creation. Bud Williams, Jr. recalls that he had trouble describing Mars, comparing it to his driveway back home.

After traveling through space for six months, Astronaut Stevenson hits the Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum, his capsule explodes, and he is scattered through time and space. While the TV correspondents struggle to remember the immortal words spoken when man first stepped on the Moon, Stevenson pops in and out of a series of strange scenes (based on Vonnegut&#x27;s novels and stories):

* On the island of San Lorenzo, he meets Bokonon (&quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;), leader of a religious cult, who has given his followers a religion of harmless lies because the truth of their lives is so difficult.
* He appears among jurors at the trial of Dr. Paul Proteus (&quot;Player Piano&quot;), who is accused of waging war against modern technology and the industrial system.
* He finds himself with Dr. Hoenikker (&quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;) and a General who discuss the military application of Ice Nine, which could freeze all water on a battlefield so soldiers would never have to fight in mud.
* He lands in a society where no one is allowed to be superior to anyone else. He sees dancers hobbled with weights struggling to perform a ballet until one dancer (&quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;) rebels by removing the handicaps from himself and his partner so they can dance freely.
* He visits an Ethical Suicide Parlor in an overpopulated world (&quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;) and meets Lionel J. Howard who wants to know one thing before he dies: &quot;What are people for?&quot;
* In the final episode, he hitches a ride on a fire truck with a young girl, Wanda June, who was hit by an ice-cream truck before her birthday party (&quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot;), and confronts his own death.

<doc id="219277" wikidata="Q1106472" url="?curid=219277" title="Codon usage bias">
<text>Codon usage bias refers to differences in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in coding DNA. A codon is a series of three nucleotides (a triplet) that encodes a specific amino acid residue in a polypeptide chain or for the termination of translation (stop codons).

There are 64 different codons (61 codons encoding for amino acids and 3 stop codons) but only 20 different translated amino acids. The overabundance in the number of codons allows many amino acids to be encoded by more than one codon. Because of such redundancy it is said that the genetic code is degenerate. The genetic codes of different organisms are often biased towards using one of the several codons that encode the same amino acid over the others—that is, a greater frequency of one will be found than expected by chance. How such biases arise is a much debated area of molecular evolution. Codon usage tables detailing genomic codon usage bias for organisms in GenBank and RefSeq can be found in the HIVE-Codon Usage Tables (HIVE-CUTs) project which contains two distinct databases, CoCoPUTs and TissueCoCoPUTs. Together, these two databases provide comprehensive, up-to-date codon, codon pair and dinucleotide usage statistics for all organisms with available sequence information and 52 human tissues, respectively.

It is generally acknowledged that codon biases reflect the contributions of 3 main factors: GC-biased gene conversion that favors GC-ending codons in diploid organisms, arrival biases reflecting mutational preferences (typically favoring AT-ending codons), and natural selection for codons that are favorable in regard to translation. Optimal codons in fast-growing microorganisms, like &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; or &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (baker&#x27;s yeast), reflect the composition of their respective genomic transfer RNA (tRNA) pool. It is thought that optimal codons help to achieve faster translation rates and high accuracy. As a result of these factors, translational selection is expected to be stronger in highly expressed genes, as is indeed the case for the above-mentioned organisms. In other organisms that do not show high growing rates or that present small genomes, codon usage optimization is normally absent, and codon preferences are determined by the characteristic mutational biases seen in that particular genome. Examples of this are &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (human) and &quot;Helicobacter pylori.&quot; Organisms that show an intermediate level of codon usage optimization include &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (fruit fly), &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; (nematode worm), &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; (sea urchin), and &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (thale cress). Several viral families (herpesvirus, lentivirus, papillomavirus, polyomavirus, adenovirus, and parvovirus) are known to encode structural proteins that display heavily skewed codon usage compared to the host cell. The suggestion has been made that these codon biases play a role in the temporal regulation of their late proteins.

The nature of the codon usage-tRNA optimization has been fiercely debated. It is not clear whether codon usage drives tRNA evolution or vice versa. At least one mathematical model has been developed where both codon usage and tRNA expression co-evolve in feedback fashion (&quot;i.e.&quot;, codons already present in high frequencies drive up the expression of their corresponding tRNAs, and tRNAs normally expressed at high levels drive up the frequency of their corresponding codons). However, this model does not seem to yet have experimental confirmation. Another problem is that the evolution of tRNA genes has been a very inactive area of research.

== Contributing factors ==

Different factors have been proposed to be related to codon usage bias, including gene expression level (reflecting selection for optimizing the translation process by tRNA abundance), guanine-cytosine content (GC content, reflecting horizontal gene transfer or mutational bias), guanine-cytosine skew (GC skew, reflecting strand-specific mutational bias), amino acid conservation, protein hydropathy, transcriptional selection, RNA stability, optimal growth temperature, hypersaline adaptation, and dietary nitrogen.

== Evolutionary theories ==

=== Mutational bias versus selection === 
Although the mechanism of codon bias selection remains controversial, possible explanations for this bias fall into two general categories. One explanation revolves around the &quot;selectionist theory&quot;, in which codon bias contributes to the efficiency and/or accuracy of protein expression and therefore undergoes positive selection. The selectionist model also explains why more frequent codons are recognized by more abundant tRNA molecules, as well as the correlation between preferred codons, tRNA levels, and gene copy numbers. Although it has been shown that the rate of amino acid incorporation at more frequent codons occurs at a much higher rate than that of rare codons, the speed of translation has not been shown to be directly affected and therefore the bias towards more frequent codons may not be directly advantageous. However, the increase in translation elongation speed may still be indirectly advantageous by increasing the cellular concentration of free ribosomes and potentially the rate of initiation for messenger RNAs (mRNAs).

The second explanation for codon usage can be explained by &quot;mutational bias&quot;, a theory which posits that codon bias exists because of nonrandomness in the mutational patterns. In other words, some codons can undergo more changes and therefore result in lower equilibrium frequencies, also known as “rare” codons. Different organisms also exhibit different mutational biases, and there is growing evidence that the level of genome-wide GC content is the most significant parameter in explaining codon bias differences between organisms. Additional studies have demonstrated that codon biases can be statistically predicted in prokaryotes using only intergenic sequences, arguing against the idea of selective forces on coding regions and further supporting the mutation bias model. However, this model alone cannot fully explain why preferred codons are recognized by more abundant tRNAs.

=== Mutation-selection-drift balance model ===
To reconcile the evidence from both mutational pressures and selection, the prevailing hypothesis for codon bias can be explained by the &quot;mutation-selection-drift balance model&quot;. This hypothesis states that selection favors major codons over minor codons, but minor codons are able to persist due to mutation pressure and genetic drift. It also suggests that selection is generally weak, but that selection intensity scales to higher expression and more functional constraints of coding sequences.

== Consequences of codon composition ==

=== Effect on RNA secondary structure ===
Because secondary structure of the 5’ end of mRNA influences translational efficiency, synonymous changes at this region on the mRNA can result in profound effects on gene expression. Codon usage in noncoding DNA regions can therefore play a major role in RNA secondary structure and downstream protein expression, which can undergo further selective pressures. In particular, strong secondary structure at the ribosome-binding site or initiation codon can inhibit translation, and mRNA folding at the 5’ end generates a large amount of variation in protein levels.

=== Effect on transcription or gene expression ===
Heterologous gene expression is used in many biotechnological applications, including protein production and metabolic engineering. Because tRNA pools vary between different organisms, the rate of transcription and translation of a particular coding sequence can be less efficient when placed in a non-native context. For an overexpressed transgene, the corresponding mRNA makes a large percent of total cellular RNA, and the presence of rare codons along the transcript can lead to inefficient use and depletion of ribosomes and ultimately reduce levels of heterologous protein production. In addition, the composition of the gene (e.g. the total number of rare codons and the presence of consecutive rare codons) may also affect translation accuracy. However, using codons that are optimized for tRNA pools in a particular host to overexpress a heterologous gene may also cause amino acid starvation and alter the equilibrium of tRNA pools. This method of adjusting codons to match host tRNA abundances, called codon optimization, has traditionally been used for expression of a heterologous gene. However, new strategies for optimization of heterologous expression consider global nucleotide content such as local mRNA folding, codon pair bias, a codon ramp, codon harmonization or codon correlations. With the number of nucleotide changes introduced, artificial gene synthesis is often necessary for the creation of such an optimized gene.

Specialized codon bias is further seen in some endogenous genes such as those involved in amino acid starvation. For example, amino acid biosynthetic enzymes preferentially use codons that are poorly adapted to normal tRNA abundances, but have codons that are adapted to tRNA pools under starvation conditions. Thus, codon usage can introduce an additional level of transcriptional regulation for appropriate gene expression under specific cellular conditions.

=== Effect on speed of translation elongation ===
Generally speaking for highly expressed genes, translation elongation rates are faster along transcripts with higher codon adaptation to tRNA pools, and slower along transcripts with rare codons. This correlation between codon translation rates and cognate tRNA concentrations provides additional modulation of translation elongation rates, which can provide several advantages to the organism. Specifically, codon usage can allow for global regulation of these rates, and rare codons may contribute to the accuracy of translation at the expense of speed.

=== Effect on protein folding ===
Protein folding &quot;in vivo&quot; is vectorial, such that the N-terminus of a protein exits the translating ribosome and becomes solvent-exposed before its more C-terminal regions. As a result, co-translational protein folding introduces several spatial and temporal constraints on the nascent polypeptide chain in its folding trajectory. Because mRNA translation rates are coupled to protein folding, and codon adaptation is linked to translation elongation, it has been hypothesized that manipulation at the sequence level may be an effective strategy to regulate or improve protein folding. Several studies have shown that pausing of translation as a result of local mRNA structure occurs for certain proteins, which may be necessary for proper folding. Furthermore, synonymous mutations have been shown to have significant consequences in the folding process of the nascent protein and can even change substrate specificity of enzymes. These studies suggest that codon usage influences the speed at which polypeptides emerge vectorially from the ribosome, which may further impact protein folding pathways throughout the available structural space.

== Methods of analysis ==

In the field of bioinformatics and computational biology, many statistical methods have been proposed and used to analyze codon usage bias. Methods such as the &#x27;frequency of optimal codons&#x27; (Fop), the relative codon adaptation (RCA) or the codon adaptation index (CAI) are used to predict gene expression levels, while methods such as the &#x27;effective number of codons&#x27; (Nc) and Shannon entropy from information theory are used to measure codon usage evenness. Multivariate statistical methods, such as correspondence analysis and principal component analysis, are widely used to analyze variations in codon usage among genes. There are many computer programs to implement the statistical analyses enumerated above, including CodonW, GCUA, INCA, etc. Codon optimization has applications in designing synthetic genes and DNA vaccines. Several software packages are available online for this purpose (refer to external links).

<doc id="219279" wikidata="Q640728" url="?curid=219279" title="Arecibo, Puerto Rico">
<text>Arecibo (; ) is a city and municipality on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, located north of Utuado and Ciales; east of Hatillo; and west of Barceloneta and Florida. It is about west of San Juan, the capital city. Arecibo is the largest municipality in Puerto Rico by area, and it is the core city of the Arecibo Metropolitan Statistical Area and part of the greater San Juan–Bayamón, PR Combined Statistical Area. It is spread over 18 &quot;barrios&quot; and Arecibo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). Its population in 2020 was 87,754.

The Arecibo Observatory, which housed the Arecibo telescope, the world&#x27;s largest radio telescope until July 2016, is located in the municipality. The Arecibo telescope collapsed on December 1, 2020. Arecibo is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arecibo.

== Etymology and nicknames ==
The name &quot;Arecibo&quot; comes from the Taíno chief Xamaica Arasibo, cacique of the &quot;yucayeque&quot; (Taíno settlement) of Abacoa where the Spanish town of Arecibo was settled in 1556. The word &quot;Arasibo&quot; itself most likely comes from the Taíno words &quot;ara&quot;, possibly meaning or related to &quot;people&quot;, and &quot;siba&quot;, most likely meaning &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;stone&quot;. This name also lends itself to the name of the river which flows through the municipality into the Atlantic Ocean.

Some of the city&#x27;s nicknames are: &quot;Villa del Capitán Correa&quot; (&quot;Villa of Captain Correa&quot;), after Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa, a Spanish soldier who famously and successfully defended the city from a British invasion; &quot;La Muy Leal&quot; (&quot;the very loyal [one]&quot;) after the title often granted to Spanish colonial cities; and &quot;Diamante del Norte&quot; (&quot;Diamond of the North&quot;) due to the city&#x27;s location in the northern coast of the island.

==History==

When the Spanish arrived, they found the area occupied by the indigenous Taíno, led by Xamaica Arasibo, Cacique (chief) of the &quot;yucayeque&quot; (town) then named Abacoa. Spanish colonists settled Arecibo in 1556, which they named for the cacique. It was their fourth settlement on the island, after Caparra (which later became San Juan), San German, and Coamo. Arecibo was officially founded as a town by the Spanish crown on May 1, 1616, under the governorship of Captain Felipe de Beaumont y Navarra, when the King of Spain granted the land (and the Taino living there) to Lope Conchillos.

For some time the island was competed for by other European powers. On August 5, 1702, Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa, commanding 30 militiamen, successfully defended Arecibo from an attack by two Royal Navy warships under William Whetstone. Whetstone&#x27;s ships landed 40 marines and sailors on two rowboats, but Correa&#x27;s troops ambushed the invaders, killing 22 and forcing the remainder to retreat. Spanish cannon fire also killed 8 men onboard Whetstone&#x27;s ships. The Spanish defenders suffered one killed and three wounded, including Correa. This gave the city its nickname &quot;The Village of Captain Correa&quot;.

In 1778, Arecibo, by royal decree, was awarded the &quot;Villa&quot; status, though it was not integrated as such until 1802. In 1850 it was awarded the &quot;Muy Leal&quot; (very loyal) title. Over time, large part of its territory became separate municipalities. These include Manati, Barceloneta, Florida, Utuado, Jayuya, Hatillo, Camuy, Quebradillas and Isabela. In 1982, it was promoted to city status, though it continued to be known by its previous nickname.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered extensive flooding, and damage to infrastructure with over 3,000 people losing their homes. Two hospitals were damaged and the hurricane caused deaths as well.

==Geography==
Arecibo is located in the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico, extending inland into the Northern Karst region. It lies on the Atlantic Ocean; north of Utuado; east of Hatillo; and west of Barceloneta and Florida. The city occupies an area of 127 square miles (330 km2), of which, , is water.

The Rio Grande de Arecibo is the main river in the municipality, running through the middle of it. South of the municipality, in the karst region, it forms the Dos Bocas Lake, a primary source of water for Northern Puerto Rico. Several rivers feed the Rio Grande, including the Tanama River. Caño Santiago is an artificial canal created in the 19th century by partially diverting the Tanama River&#x27;s waters tobarrios a small temporary stream, to supply water to poor neighborhoods in Arecibo, discharging into the Arecibo River near its own mouth. In the 1950s it was modified to pass slightly more south of the city center. Poor maintenance, sediment and pollution has turned the canal once again into a temporary stream. East of the river lies Caño Tiburones, an important marshland area that provides habitat for many kinds of birds and wildlife.

Arecibo has two forest reserves. Cambalache State Forest is located along the Barceloneta municipal limits, while Rio Abajo State Forest is located between Arecibo and Utuado. Caves include Cueva Ventana, which overlooks the valley formed by the Rio Grande de Arecibo, and Cueva del Indio (Cave of the Indian), where paintings made by prehistoric indigenous peoples have been seen.

Environmental impact studies have been done to consider remedies for flooding that often occurs in Arecibo.

===Barrios===

Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Arecibo is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as , near the center of the municipality.

===Sectors===

Barrios (which for US census purposes, are like minor civil divisions) in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Arecibo: 
 and .

===Climate===
Tropical monsoon climate, occasionally also known as a tropical wet climate or tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral climate in climate classification, is a relatively rare type of climate. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Am&quot;. (Tropical Monsoon Climate).

===Landmarks and places of interest===
The Arecibo Harbor is managed by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.

Arecibo is one of the oldest colonial towns in Puerto Rico (1616). Among its historic buildings is the Cathedral of Saint Philip the Apostle, built beginning in the late 18th century. The first church, built in the middle of the 17th century, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1787. Construction of its replacement began soon after, although it was not completed until 1846. Four days after its dedication, another earthquake seriously damaged it. Repairs were not completed until 1882. The 1918 earthquake damaged the vault so badly that it was replaced by a flat concrete roof; a vaulted ceiling of composition board was placed inside.

The cathedral of Arecibo is Puerto Rico&#x27;s second-largest church after the Cathedral of San Juan. The plan is rectangular with three naves; the side naves are cut short to allow large flanking chapels, which occupy almost half the length of the church. The apse is semicircular, and has an unusual half-dome covering it. The facade is a triangular composition of three stages. The top stage, a short central tower, is a later addition, according to local architects and historians. Neoclassic ornamentation is used in an academic fashion on the lowest stage, but the other two show a less traditional use of bands and pilasters. The Renaissance-style windows are uncommon in Puerto Rican churches, but the central tower over the entrance is a common motif used throughout the island.
The City Hall, built in 1866, served as jail to revolutionaries of &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot; in 1868. In the 1918 earthquake, the frontal section of the building was destroyed. When repairs were made, a tower and clock were added to the building. In 1978, the building was restored to its original form.

The City Hall of Arecibo is typical of these regional seats of government. It is relatively modest in size, of stuccoed masonry, with an academically correct composition, having a pedimented center pavilion which projects slightly. The lower story is rusticated, with arched openings; the three doorways in the center giving the effect of a &quot;loggia.&quot; The upper windows all have segmental pediments and balconies; the central trio share one long balcony. Architectural detailing is modest, but the building is graceful and charming.

In 1898 the Spaniards built the Punta Los Morrillos Lighthouse. It was automated in 1964 and is still in use. A small park, Arecibo Lighthouse and Historical Park, has been established around it.

The Arecibo Observatory was the home of Arecibo telescope, once the largest single-aperture radio telescope ever constructed and one of the world&#x27;s most powerful radar-radio telescopes. The observatory&#x27;s purpose was to support scientific studies. It attracted several Hollywood directors who have filmed there; most recently &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and &quot;Contact&quot;. The radio telescope was used in 1974 to send the Arecibo message to space. The telescope collapsed in 2020.
Casa Ulanga was originally a residence built by Spanish immigrant Francisco Ulanga, and has served multiple uses over the years. It was used as a bank, store, city hall of Arecibo, hospital, jail, tribunal, and is now operated as the Arecibo Cultural Center.
 is an archeological site where Taíno drawings can be found.

The &quot;Birth of the New World&quot; is a statue depicting Christopher Columbus and is located in Islote, Arecibo. . The statue is the work of Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, and it is the tallest statue in the Americas.

Other places of interest in Arecibo include:
*The Cambalache Forest Reserve
* Dos Bocas Lake which is a reservoir located between the municipalities of Arecibo and Utuado.
* Paseo Victor Rojas (Victor Rojas Walk) also known as or simply , was built in 1881 where the Fort San Miguel&#x27;s ruins once were
* Manuel &quot;Petaca&quot; Iguina Coliseum which is home of the Arecibo Captains basketball team.

* Museum of Art and History of Arecibo which has art from local artists and shows the city&#x27;s history

Arecibo beaches include Los Morillos, Los Negritos, Poza del Obispo, and Las Tunas. Beach in Arecibo is considered a dangerous beach.

To stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the &quot;Voy Turistiendo&quot; (I&#x27;m Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with a page for each municipality. The Arecibo passport page lists , , and the Arecibo Light House and Historical Park, as places of interest.

==Culture==
===Festivals and events===
Arecibo began celebrating its patron saint festival in 1616. Arecibo celebrates its patron saint festival in May. The is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment. 

Other festivals and events celebrated in Arecibo include:
* Bicycle competition – January
* (Parachuting festival) – February
* Arecibo Carnival – February
* Folklore Festival – July
* Beach festival – July
* Artisan Fair – September
* Cetí Festival – November
* Centennial of the Puerto Rican flag – December

===Sports===
Arecibo has two professional sports franchises, the Lobos de Arecibo in the Roberto Clemente Professional Baseball League (a.k.a. Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente or LBPRC), and the Capitanes de Arecibo in the National Superior Basketball League (Baloncesto Superior Nacional or BSN).

====Baseball====
The Lobos won the 1983 then-known Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (LBPPR) national baseball championship and the 1983 Caribbean World Series, the only time the franchise won both titles. At that time, they had MLB prospect Dickie Thon, then also of the Houston Astros, on their roster. Thon then suffered a life-threatening and career-affecting eye injury during an Astros game in 1984. The Lobos won a championship again in 1996.

====Basketball====
The Capitanes won their first ever BSN national championship in 1959. After that, the Capitanes have not had much luck in their basketball tournaments for the next few decades. However, that would begin to change in 2002, as they started to turn things around, by reaching the BSN semifinals; yet they lost the series to the Vaqueros de Bayamón by losing four straight games, after having a 3–0 series lead, thus failing their chances to make into the finals. In 2005, the Capitanes won the BSN national championship by defeating the Vaqueros de Bayamón in a four-game sweep. This was the first championship in 46 years. In 2007 they got to the finals, losing in the overtime on the seventh game of the series against the Cangrejeros de Santurce. In 2008 Arecibo won their third BSN national championship, this time against the Gigantes de Carolina. In 2010, they won their fourth BSN national title in six seasons, this time against the Vaqueros de Bayamón.

They also have operations in Hatillo. After Hurricane Maria, the farm had to consolidate their three operations into one.

===Business===
Arecibo&#x27;s main shopping mall is Plaza del Atlantico as well as the one situated in the neighboring town of Hatillo, Plaza del Norte.

In 2021, Hilton was constructing a hotel in Arecibo.

===Industrial===
Arecibo is home to Fortune 500 corporations such as Merck, General Electric. Other important companies are Thermo King Corporation, Eaton, Los Cidrines, Expressway Eco Printing, Arecibo Tropical Flag and ABB.

==Demographics==

People who are multi-racial may also have ancestors more than one of the European groups, and among more than one African nation as well.

The flag of Arecibo derives its composition and colors from the coat of arms of the city. It is divided vertically in two equal parts. The left side is blue having a belt that stands for &quot;Captain Correa&quot;, a local military hero from Spanish times. The right side is made up of blue and yellow diamonds alternating in a checkerboard pattern referring to the coat of arms of Felipe de Beaumont y Navarra, governor of Puerto Rico (1614–1620) and founder of the city. The crown represents The Cacique (chieftain) Arasibo (Fransico Jamaica Arasibo). The turtles represent the ancientness of the city (the third city of Puerto Rico) also because of the indigenous people of the region and that the hunting of turtles was a source of wealth. The towers were a form to describe the population of a settlement. Three towers represent a municipality, four towers represent a village, and five towers represent a city.

===Coat of arms===

The shield is divided by diagonal lines in golden and blue rhombuses with a blue stripe in the superior part, in which resides an opened five-point crown and which is adorned with drawings characterizing the art of the Taínos. The people of Arecibo also honored Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa by including a gold colored belt in their coat of arms with the words &quot;Muy Leal&quot;, which means &quot;Very Faithful&quot;, in representation of Correa. This combination of symbols represents the Indian Cacique (Chieftain) from whom the population&#x27;s name derives, the governor that erected the town and the hero Captain Correa who defended the town from a British invasion.

<doc id="219280" wikidata="Q1362257" url="?curid=219280" title="Terje Rød-Larsen">
<text>Terje Rød-Larsen (born 22 November 1947) is a Norwegian diplomat, politician, and sociologist.

Rød-Larsen came to wide international prominence as a key figure in the 1990s negotiations that led to the Oslo Accords—the first-ever agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)—when he served as the Director of the Fafo institute. He is played by the actor Andrew Scott in the film Oslo, based on the play of the same name.

In 1993, Rød-Larsen was appointed Ambassador and Special Adviser for the Middle East Peace process to the Norwegian Foreign Minister, and the following year, he became the United Nations Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories at the rank of Under-Secretary-General.

Rød-Larsen briefly served as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Planning and Cooperation of Norway in the Jagland cabinet in 1996. He had to resign after a tax affair regarding him came to public attention.

Rød-Larsen then returned to the United Nations, where he again became an Under-Secretary-General, serving as the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority from 1999 to 2004.

From 2004 to 2020, Rød-Larsen has been the president of the International Peace Institute (IPI), based in New York City, adjacent to the United Nations, which the IPI works with extensively. He resigned in 2020 over previously undisclosed links to Jeffrey Epstein.

==Biography==
Rød-Larsen grew up in Bergen and studied social sciences, culminating in a Ph.D. in sociology. He taught at Norwegian universities until 1981, when he helped found FAFO, a research organization funded by the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions.

===Early Middle East work===
In 1989 Rød-Larsen moved to Cairo, when his wife Mona Juul, who worked for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was stationed there. He continued to work for FAFO, as the organization had become more internationally oriented during the 1980s. Rød-Larsen performed a detailed sociological study of living conditions in the West Bank, Gaza and Eastern Jerusalem. In the course of this work, Rød-Larsen made contacts that proved to be useful in secret negotiations between Israel and the PLO.

===Oslo Accords===
When serving as the Director of the Fafo institute in the early 1990s, Rød-Larsen became a key figure in the 1990s negotiations that led to the Oslo Accords -- the first-ever agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). He served a pivotal role in the negotiations not only overtly, but in secret back-channel maneuvers and communications -- largely arranged and facilitated by him and his wife, Norwegian diplomat Mona Juul. She was able to facilitate high-level contacts with the Norwegian foreign minister, Johan Jørgen Holst, who was instrumental in reaching the Oslo Accords -- leading to the peace agreement signing on September 13, 1993 in Washington D.C.&quot;

The 2016-2017 Broadway play, &quot;Oslo,&quot; by noted playwright J. T. Rogers, is a widely-praised dramatization of the previously unheralded secret work of Rød-Larsen and his wife, and others, in developing the back-channel communications that (reportedly) saved the Oslo negotiations from collapsing.

The same year Rød-Larsen became formally employed by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a special advisor on Middle Eastern affairs.

===Mid-1990s to Mid-2000s===
From 1994 to 1996, Rød-Larsen served as former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali&#x27;s first &quot;Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories.&quot;

In 1996, Rød-Larsen served briefly as minister of administration in the government of Thorbjørn Jagland, before being forced to resign as the result of a tax scandal.

In 9/9/1999, Rød-Larsen was appointed as UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan&#x27;s personal representative to the PLO and Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. He was also the UN Special Coordinator for peace negotiations in the Middle East. He subsequently left the post in 2004 to become President of the International Peace Academy, a NYC-based think tank, and was also designated as UN Special Representative (Date of Appointment : 3/1/2005) for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1559, which calls for Syrian withdrawal of Lebanon and the disarmament of Hezbollah.

===2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict===

====16 August====

Rød-Larsen was sent by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Lebanon and Israel to follow up on the implementation of the cease-fire resolution, the United Nations announced on 16 August 2006.

====20 August====
On this date Rød-Larsen told reporters. &quot;There is a golden opportunity for Lebanon to solidify its democracy, to assert it authority, to produce a situation where Lebanon can be reconstructed and where Lebanese can live peacefully with its neighbors in prosperity. All this is at hand.&quot;

====22 August====
The United Nations special envoy to Syria and Lebanon said on 22 August 2006 it could take the Lebanese army and international troops two to three months to fill a &quot;security vacuum&quot; in southern Lebanon and warned that &quot;unintended&quot; acts could spark renewed fighting.

&quot;There is now a security vacuum which the Lebanese government is trying to fill&quot; with the help of international forces, said Terje Rød-Larsen. &quot;But I think realistically, up to a point, you will have such a vacuum in Lebanon for the next two, three months,&quot; he added. &quot;The situation is still extremely fragile... Unintended incidents can kick off renewed violence, which might escalate and spin out of control.&quot;

==Controversy==
In 2020 media revealed that he Rød-Larsen had borrowed 130,000 USD from Jeffrey Epstein. During the week that preceded 18 October 2020, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry requested that Rød-Larsen clarify the ties between Epstein and himself. On 21 October, Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot; said that sometime after the money was borrowed, Rød-Larsen &quot;gave the green light for a payment of 100,000 dollars from [the International Peace Institute (IPI)] to Epstein&quot;, although an audit by accounting firm KPMG found no payment was made. On 29 October 2020, Rød-Larsen resigned the presidency of the IPI.

<doc id="219283" wikidata="Q210540" url="?curid=219283" title="Syriac Orthodox Church">
<text>The Syriac Orthodox Church (),officially known as the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East, and informally as the Jacobite Church is an Oriental Orthodox church that branched from the Church of Antioch. While exact figures may vary, the church has around 1.4 - 1.7 million followers. The church upholds Miaphysite doctrine in Christology and employs the Liturgy of Saint James, associated with James the Just. Classical Syriac is the official and liturgical language of the church.

The bishop of Antioch, known as the patriarch, heads the church and possesses apostolic succession through Saint Peter, according to sacred tradition. Since 2014, Ignatius Aphrem II has served as the Patriarch of Antioch. Mor Hananyo Monastery was the headquarters of the church from until 1932. Since 1959, The current see of the church is the Cathedral of Saint George in Bab Tuma, Damascus, Syria. The Syriac Orthodox Church comprises 26 archdioceses and 13 patriarchal vicariates.

Jacobite Syrian Christian Church is an autonomous body in India with the Catholicos of India as the head of the church. Roughly one million or two-thirds of the total adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church are part of this sub-church.

The Syriac Orthodox Church became distinct in 512 when Miaphysite theologian Severus the Great was chosen as patriarch after a synod was held at Laodicea, Syria following the deposition of the pro-Chalcedonian patriarch Flavian II by Emperor Anastasius I. Severus&#x27;s later removal in 518 wasn&#x27;t recognized by some and this led to the establishment of an independent Miaphysite patriarchate headed by Severus. In the 6th century, Jacob Baradaeus strengthened the Miaphysite hierarchy, while pro-Chalcedonian factions formed the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Maronite Church.

In 1662, the vacant Syriac Patriarchate aligned with the Catholic Church, but after Gregory Peter VI&#x27;s death in 1702, the Catholic patriarchal line temporarily ceased. It resumed in 1782 with Michael III Jarweh, creating the Syriac Catholic Church, while the non-Catholic faction retained its separate patriarchate.

==Name and identity==

Syriac-speaking Christians have referred to themselves as &quot;&quot;Ārāmāyē/Āṯūrāyē/Sūryāyē&quot; &quot; in native Aramaic terms based on their ethnic identity. In most languages, a unique name has long been used to distinguish the church from the polity of Syria. In Arabic (the official language of Syria), the church is known as the &quot;Kenissa Suryaniya&quot; as the term &quot;Suryani&quot; identifies the Syriac language and people. Chalcedonians refer to the church as &quot;Jacobite&quot; (after Jacob Baradaeus) since the schism that followed the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451. English-speaking historians identified the church as the &quot;Syrian Church&quot;. The English term &quot;Syrian&quot; was used to describe the community of Syriacs in ancient Syria. In the 15th century, the term &quot;Orthodox&quot; (from Greek: &quot;orthodoxía&quot;; &quot;correct opinion&quot;) was used to identify churches that practiced the set of doctrines believed by the early Christians. Since 1922, the term &quot;Syrian&quot; started being used for things named after the Syrian Federation. Hence, in 2000, the Holy Synod ruled that the church be named as &quot;Syriac Orthodox Church&quot; after the Syriac language, the official liturgical language of the church.

The church is not ethnically exclusive, but two main ethnic groups in the community contest their ethnic identification as Assyrians and Arameans. &quot;Suryoye&quot; is the term used to identify the Syriacs in the diaspora. The Syriac Orthodox identity included auxiliary cultural traditions of the Assyrian Empire and Aramean kingdoms. Church traditions crystallized into ethnogenesis through the preservation of their stories and customs by the 12th century. Since the 1910s, the identity of Syriac Orthodoxy in the Ottoman Empire was principally religious and linguistic.

In recent works, Assyrian-American historian Sargon Donabed has pointed out that parishes in the US were originally using &quot;Assyrian&quot; designations in their official English names, also noting that in some cases those designations were later changed to &quot;Syrian&quot; and then to &quot;Syriac&quot;, while several other parishes still continue to use &quot;Assyrian&quot; designations.

The church claims apostolic succession through the pre-Chalcedonian Patriarchate of Antioch to the Early Christian communities from Jerusalem led by Saint Barnabas and Saint Paul in Antioch, during the Apostolic era, as described in the Acts of the Apostles; &quot;The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch&quot; ( ). Saint Peter was selected by Jesus Christ ( ) and is venerated as the first bishop of Antioch in after the Incident at Antioch.

Saint Evodius was Bishop of Antioch until 66 AD and was succeeded by Saint Ignatius of Antioch. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;Christianity&quot; () was by Ignatius of Antioch, in around 100 AD. In A.D 169, Theophilus of Antioch wrote three apologetic tracts to Autolycus. Patriarch Babylas of Antioch was considered the first saint recorded as having had his remains moved or &quot;translated&quot; for religious purposes—a practice that was to become extremely common in later centuries. Eustathius of Antioch supported Athanasius of Alexandria who opposed the followers of the condemned doctrine of Arius (Arian controversy) at the First Council of Nicaea. During the time of Meletius of Antioch the church split due to his being deposed for Homoiousian leanings—which became known as the Meletian Schism and saw several groups and several claimants to the See of Antioch.

====Patriarchate of Antioch====
Given the antiquity of the Bishopric of Antioch and the importance of the Christian community in the city of Antioch, a commercially significant city in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire, the First Council of Nicaea (325) recognized the Bishopric as one of main regional primacies in Christendom, with jurisdiction over the administrative Diocese of the Orient, thus laying the foundation for the creation of the &quot;Patriarchate of Antioch and All of the East&quot;. Because of the significance attributed to Ignatius of Antioch in the church, most of the Syriac Orthodox patriarchs since 1293 have used the name of Ignatius in the title of the Patriarch preceding their own Patriarchal name.

Christological controversies that followed the Council of Chalcedon (451) resulted in a long struggle for the Patriarchate between those who accepted and those who rejected the council. In 512, pro-Chalcedonian patriarch Flavian II of Antioch was deposed by Emperor Anastasius I (d. 518), and on 6 November 512, at the synod of Laodicea in Syria, a prominent miapyhsite theologian Severus of Antioch (d. 538) was elected, and later consecrated on 16 November at the Great Church of Antioch. In 518, he was exiled from Antioch, by new emperor Justin I (d. 527), who tried to enforce a uniform Chalcedonian orthodoxy throughout the empire. Those who belonged to the pro-Chalcedonian party accepted newly appointed patriarch Paul, who took over the see of Antioch. The miaphisite patriarchate was thus forced to move from Antioch with Severus the Great who took refuge in Alexandria. The non-Chalcedonian community was divided between &quot;Severians&quot; (followers of Severus), and aphthartodocetae, and that division remained unresolved until 527. Severians continued to recognize Severus as the legitimate miaphysite Patriarch of Antioch until his death in 538, and then proceeded to follow his successors.

Bishop Jacob Baradaeus (died 578) is credited for ordaining most of the miaphysite hierarchy while facing heavy persecution in the sixth century. In 544, Baradeus ordained Sergius of Tella, continuing the non-Chalcedonian succession of patriarchs of the Church of Antioch. That was done in opposition to the government-backed Patriarchate of Antioch held by the pro-Chalcedonian believers leading to the Syriac Orthodox Church being known popularly as the &quot;Jacobite&quot; Church, while the Chalcedonian believers were known popularly as &quot;Melkites&quot;, coming from the Syriac word for king, malka (an implication of the Chalcedonian Church&#x27;s relationship to the Roman Emperor, later emphasised by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church). Because of many historical upheavals and consequent hardships that the Syriac Orthodox Church had to undergo, the patriarchate was transferred to different monasteries in Mesopotamia for centuries. John III of the Sedre was elected and consecrated Patriarch after the death of Athanasius I Gammolo in 631 AD, followed by the fall of Roman Syria and the Muslim conquest of the Levant. John and several bishops were summoned before Emir Umayr ibn Sad al-Ansari of Hims to engage in open debate regarding Christianity and represent the entire Christian community, including non-Syriac Orthodox communities, such as Greek Orthodox Syrians. The Emir demanded translations of the Gospels into Arabic to confirm John&#x27;s beliefs, which according to the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, was the first translation of the Gospels into Arabic.

===Middle Ages===
The 8th century hagiography &quot;Life of Jacob Baradaeus&quot; is evidence of a definite denominational and social differentiation between the Chalcedonians and Miaphysites (Syriac Orthodox). The longer hagiography shows that the Syriac Orthodox (called &quot;Syriac Jacobites&quot; in the work: &quot;suryoye yaquboye&quot;) self-identified with Jacob&#x27;s story more than those of other saints. Coptic historian and miaphysite bishop Severus ibn al-Muqaffa (ca. 897) speaks of Jacobite origins, and on the veneration of Jacob Baradaeus. He claimed that unlike the Chalcedonian Christians (who were labeled as &quot;Melkites&quot;), Miaphysite Jacobites never traded their Orthodoxy to win the favor of the Byzantine emperors, as the Melkites had done (&quot;malko&quot; is derived from &quot;ruler, king, emperor&quot;).

In the 10th century, after the Byzantine reconquest of Cappadocia, Cilicia and Syria, the Byzantine emperor encouraged Syriac settlement of these new frontier lands and a period of economic and intellectual flourishing lasted for Syriac Orthodox communities from 950 to 1020. The Syriac Patriarch John VII Sarigta and his two successors lived at the Monastery of Bārid close to Melitene, one of the many newly founded monasteries at the time, and Syriac Orthodox Christians were granted access to imperial positions. The wealth and influence of the Syriac Orthodox communities then sparked conflicts with the Byzantine church, which begun to persecute Syriac Orthodox Christians, forcing Patriarch Dionysius IV to move the seat to the Arabic Amida.

Before the advent of the Crusades in the 11th century, the Syriacs occupied most of the hill country of Jazirah (Upper Mesopotamia). In Antioch, after the 11th-century persecutions by the Byzantines, the Syriac Orthodox population was almost extinguished. Only one Jacobite church is attested in Antioch in the first half of the 12th century, which led Dorothea Weltecke to conclude that the Syriac Orthodox population was very low in this period in Antioch and its surroundings.

This changed during the 12th century when the Crusader states were established. Scholars agree generally that relations between the Syriac Orthodox and Latins in Outremer were good. The Syriac population in the Principality of Antioch grew, also due to the influx of refugees, which also manifested itself in the construction of two further churches. During that time, several Syriac Orthodox patriarchs visited Antioch, with some even establishing temporary residences there, and the Syriac Orthodox hierarchy in Antioch was prepared to accept Latin supervision. Nevertheless, they stayed officially independent although they also engaged in talks with the Byzantines and Latins about church union.

In 1293, the patriarchal seat was transferred from the Mor Bar Sauma Monastery, where the patriarchs had resided since 1166,and then to the Mor Hananyo Monastery (Deir al. Zaʿfarān) in southeastern Anatolia near Mardin where it would remain until 1933, when it was re-established in Homs, Syria, due to the adverse political situation in Turkey.

===Early modern period===
====16th century====

Among the notable churchmen of the period, Moses of Mardin (fl. 1549–d. 1592), was a diplomat of the Syriac Orthodox Church in Rome in the 16th century.

====17th century====

By the early 1660s, 75% of the 5,000 Syriac Orthodox people of Aleppo had converted to Catholicism following the arrival of mendicant missionaries. The Catholic missionaries had sought to place a Catholic Patriarch among the Jacobites and consecrated Andrew Akhijan as the Patriarch of the newly founded Syriac Catholic Church. The Propaganda Fide and foreign diplomats pushed for Akhijan to be recognized as the Jacobite Patriarch, and the Porte then consented and warned the Syriac Orthodox that they would be considered an enemy if they did not recognize him. Despite the warning and gifts to priests, frequent conflicts and violent arguments continued between the Catholic and Orthodox Syriacs.

Around 1665, many Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala, India, committed themselves in allegiance to the Syriac Orthodox Church, which established the Malankara Syrian Church. The Malankara Church consolidated under Mar Thoma I welcomed Gregorios Abdal Jaleel, who regularised the canonical ordination of Mar Thoma I as a native democratically elected Bishop of the Malabar Syrian Christians.

=== Late modern period ===
In the 19th century, the various Syriac Christian denominations did not view themselves as part of one ethnic group. During the &quot;Tanzimat&quot; reforms (1839–78), the Syriac Orthodox was granted independent status by gaining recognition as their own millet in 1873, apart from Armenians and Greeks.

In the late 19th century, the Syriac Orthodox community of the Middle East, primarily from the cities of Adana and Harput, began the process of creating the Syriac diaspora, with United States being one of their first destinations in the 1890s. Later, the first Syriac Orthodox Church in the United States was built in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Also in the late 1800s, the reformation faction of the Saint Thomas Christians in India split from the Syriac Orthodox Church and formed the Mar Thoma Syrian Church.

The 1895–96 massacres in Turkey affected the Armenian and Syriac Orthodox communities when an estimated 105,000 Christians were killed. By the end of the 19th century, 200,000 Syriac Orthodox Christians remained in the Middle East, most concentrated around Saffron Monastery, the Patriarchal Seat.

In 1870, there were 22 Syriac Orthodox settlements in the vicinity of Diyarbakır. In the 1870–71 Diyarbakır &quot;salnames&quot;, there were 1,434 Orthodox Syriacs in that city. On 10 December 1876, Ignatius Peter IV consecrated Geevarghese Gregorios of Parumala as metropolitan. Rivalry within the Syriac Orthodox Church in Tur Abdin resulted in many conversions to the Syriac Catholic Church (the Uniate branch).

==== Genocide (1914–1918) ====

The Ottoman authorities killed and deported Orthodox Syriacs, then looted and appropriated their properties. During 1915–16, the number of Orthodox Syriacs in the Diyarbakır province was reduced by 72%, and in the Mardin province by 58%.

==== Interwar period ====
In 1924, the patriarchate of the church was transferred to Homs after Kemal Atatürk expelled the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch, who took the library of Deir el-Zaferan and settled in Damascus. The Syriac Orthodox villages in Tur Abdin suffered from the 1925–26 Kurdish rebellions and massive flight to Lebanon, northern Iraq and especially Syria ensued.

In the early 1920s, the city of Qamishli was built mainly by Syriac Orthodox refugees, escaping the Syriac genocide.

==== 1945–2000 ====
In 1959, the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Church was transferred to Damascus in Syria. In the mid-1970s, the estimate of Syriac Orthodox living in Syria was 82,000. In 1977, the number of Syriac Orthodox followers in diaspora dioceses was: 9,700 in the Diocese of Middle Europe; 10,750 in the Diocese of Sweden and surrounding countries.

On 20 October 1987, Geevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala was declared a saint by Ignatius Zakka I Iwas, Patriarch permitting additions to the diptychs. The mother church and official seat of the Syriac Orthodox Church are now situated in Bab Tuma, Damascus, capital of Syria.
==Leadership==
===Patriarch===
The supreme head of the Syriac Orthodox Church is named Patriarch of Antioch, in reference to his titular pretense to one of the five patriarchates of the Pentarchy of Byzantine Christianity. Considered the &quot;father of fathers&quot;, he must be an ordained bishop. He is the general administrator to Holy Synod and supervises the spiritual, administrative, and financial matters of the church. The Patriarch oversees the church&#x27;s external relations with other churches and signs documents related to church affairs—such as agreements, treaties, contracts, and pastoral communications (including encyclicals, also known as bulls, and pastoral letters).

===Maphrian or Catholicos of India===
The word Maphrian comes from the Syriac word &quot;mafriano&quot;, meaning &#x27;one who fructifies&#x27;. After the Patriarch, the second highest Rank in the Syriac Orthodox Church is that of the Maphrian or the Catholicos of India. He is important functionary in guiding the church when the patriarchate falls vacant after the death of a Patriarch, overseeing the election of the next Patriarch and leading the ceremony for the ordination of the Patriarch. The Maphrian&#x27;s see is India and is the head of the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church and is subject to the authority of the Patriarch. In joint councils the Maphrian is seated on the right side of the Patriarch and heads the church&#x27;s regional synod in India with the Patriarch&#x27;s sanction.

===Archbishops and bishops===
The title &quot;bishop&quot; comes from the Greek word&quot; episkopos,&quot; meaning &quot;the one who oversees&quot;. A bishop is a spiritual ruler of the church who has different ranks. In the Syriac Orthodox Church, There are metropolitan bishops or archbishops, and under them, there are auxiliary bishops. The local head of an archdiocese is an archbishop. He is under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch and is accountable to the Holy Synod.

===Priests===
The priest (&quot;Kasheesho&quot;) is the seventh rank and is the one duly appointed to administer the sacraments. Unlike in the Catholic Church, Syriac deacons may marry before being ordained as priests; they cannot marry after ordained as priests. Corepiscopos is the highest honorary rank given to married priests. A corespiscops has the privileges of &quot;first among the priests&quot; and is given a chain with a cross and specific vestment decorations.The ranks above the Corepiscopos are unmarried.

===Deacons===

In the Syriac Orthodox tradition, different ranks among the deacons are specifically assigned with particular duties. The seven ranks of the diaconate are:
# &quot;Ulmoyo&quot; (Faithful)
# &quot;Mawdyono&quot; (Confessor of faith)
# &quot;Mzamrono&quot; (Singer)
# &quot;Quroyo&quot; or &quot;Korooyo&quot; (Reader or Lector)
# &quot;Afudyaqno&quot; (Sub-deacon)
# &quot;Mshamsono&quot; (Full or evangelical deacon)
# &quot;Arkhedyaqno&quot; (Archdeacon)
Each archdiocese may have one archdeacon who is referred to as &quot;the right hand of the bishop&quot;. Only qualified and learned deacons are elevated to this office.

Only a full deacon can take the censer during the Divine Liturgy to assist the priest. In the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, because of the lack of deacons, altar assistants who do not have a rank of deacon hood may assist the priest.

Historically, in the Malankara Church, the local chief was called as Archdeacon, who was the ecclesiastical authority of the Saint Thomas Christians in the Malabar region of India.

===Deaconess===
An ordained deaconess is entitled to enter the sanctuary only for cleaning, lighting the lamps and is limited to give Holy Communion to women and the children who are under the age of five. She can read scriptures, Holy Gospel in a public gathering. The name of deaconess can also be given to a choirgirl. Deaconess is not ordained as chanter before reaching fifteen years of age. The ministry of the deaconess assists the priest and deacon outside the altar including in the service of baptizing women and anointing them with holy chrism.

While this rank exists, it is rarely awarded.

== Worship ==

=== Bible ===

Syriac Orthodox churches uses the Peshitta (Syriac: ܡܦܩܬܐ ܦܫܝܛܬܐ , Trans: simple, common) as its Bible. The New Testament books of this Bible are estimated to have been translated from Greek to Syriac between the late first century to the early third century AD. The Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated from Hebrew, probably in the second century. The New Testament of the Peshitta, which originally excluded certain disputed books, had become the standard by the early fifth century, replacing two early Syriac versions of the gospels.

=== Doctrine ===
The Syriac Orthodox Church theology is based on the Nicene Creed. The Syriac Orthodox Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its metropolitans are the successors of Christ&#x27;s Apostles, and that the Patriarch is the successor to Saint Peter on whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. The church accepted first three synods held at Nicaea (325), Constantinople (381), and Ephesus (431), shaping the formulation and early interpretation of Christian doctrines. The Syriac Orthodox Church is part of Oriental Orthodoxy, a distinct communion of churches claiming to continue the patristic and apostolic Christology before the schism following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. In terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonian) understanding is that Christ is &quot;One Nature—the Logos Incarnate, of the full humanity and full divinity&quot;. Just as humans are &quot;of&quot; their mothers and fathers and not &quot;in&quot; their mothers and fathers, so too is the nature of Christ according to Oriental Orthodoxy. The Chalcedonian understanding is that Christ is &quot;in two natures, full humanity and full divinity&quot;. This is the doctrinal difference that separated the Oriental Orthodox from the rest of Christendom. The church believes in the mystery of Incarnation and venerate Virgin Mary as Theotokos or &quot;Yoldath Aloho&quot; (Meaning: &#x27;Bearer of God&#x27;).

The Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church gave a theological interpretation to the primacy of Saint Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the early Christian community. Ephrem, Aphrahat, and Maruthas unequivocally acknowledged the office of Peter. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of church buildings, marriages, ordinations etc., reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of faith of the church. The church does not believe in Papal Primacy as understood by the Roman See, rather, Petrine Primacy according to the ancient Syriac tradition. The church uses both Julian calendar and Gregorian calendar based on their regions and traditions they adapted.

===Language===
* Syriac language, as the most prominent variant of Aramaic language in the Christian era, is used by the Syriac Orthodox Church in two basic forms: Classical Syriac is traditionally employed as the main liturgical and literary language, while the Neo-Aramaic (Neo-Syriac) dialect known as Turoyo is spoken as the most common vernacular language.
* Arabic had become the dominant language of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Egypt by the 11th century. Syriac Orthodox clergy wrote in Arabic using Garshūni, a Syriac script in the 15th century and later adopted the Arabic script. An English missionary in the 1840s noted that the Arabic speech of the Syriacs was intermixed with Syriac vocabulary. They chose Arabic and Muslim-sounding names, while women had Biblical names.
* Greek language was historically used (along with Syriac) in the earliest periods, during and after the separation (5th–6th centuries), but its use gradually declined.
* English is used globally alongside Syriac.
* Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada are presently used in India. 
* Suriyani Malayalam, also known as Karshoni or Syriac Malayalam, is a dialect of Malayalam written in a variant form of the Syriac alphabet which was popular among the Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasranis) of Kerala in India. It uses Malayalam grammar, the Maḏnḥāyā or &quot;Eastern&quot; Syriac script with special orthographic features, and vocabulary from Malayalam and East Syriac. This originated in the South Indian region of the Malabar Coast (modern-day Kerala). Until the 19th century, the script was widely used by Syrian Christians in Kerala.
* Swedish, German, Dutch, Turkish, Spanish, and Portuguese are used in their respective diasporas along with Syriac.

=== Liturgy ===

The liturgical service is called Holy Qurobo in the Syriac language meaning &quot;Eucharist&quot;. The Liturgy of Saint James is celebrated on Sundays and special occasions. The Holy Eucharist consists of Gospel reading, Bible readings, prayers, and songs. The recitation of the Liturgy is performed according to with specific parts chanted by the presider, the lectors, the choir, and the congregated faithful, at certain times in unison. Apart from certain readings, prayers are sung in the form of chants and melodies. Hundreds of melodies remain preserved in the book known as &quot;Beth Gazo&quot;, the key reference to Syriac Orthodox church music.

In 1983, the French ethnomusicologist Christian Poché produced audio recordings of the liturgical music of the Syriac Orthodox Church. In his liner notes for the UNESCO Anthology of Traditional Music, he described the liturgical music of communities in Antioch, Tur ‘Abdin, Urfa, Mardin in modern Turkey, as well as in Aleppo and Qamishli in modern Syria.

=== Prayer ===
Syriac Orthodox clergy and laity follow a regimen of seven prayers a day that are said at fixed prayer times, in accordance with Psalm 119 (cf. Shehimo). According to the Syriac tradition, an ecclesiastical day starts at sunset and the Canonical hours are based on West Syriac Rite:
* Evening or &quot;Ramsho&quot; prayer (Vespers)
* Night prayer or &quot;Sootoro&quot; prayer (Compline)
* Midnight or &quot;Lilyo&quot; prayer (Matins)
* Morning or &quot;Saphro&quot; prayer (Prime or Lauds, 6 a.m.)
* Third Hour or &quot;tloth sho`in&quot; prayer (Terce, 9 a.m.)
* Sixth Hour or &quot;sheth sho`in&quot; prayer (Sext, noon)
* Ninth Hour or &quot;tsha` sho&#x27;in&quot; prayer (None, 3 p.m.)

=== Sacraments ===
The seven Holy Sacraments of the church are:
=== Vestments ===

The clergy of the Syriac Orthodox Church has unique liturgical vestments with their order in the priesthood, there are overlaps with each building on each other.

==== Non-ceremonial ====
The priest usual dress, worn when not performing sacraments, is a black robe. In India, due to the hot weather, priests usually wear white robes except during prayers in the church, when they wear a black robe over the white one. A priest also wears a &quot;phiro&quot; (black cap), which he must wear for the public prayers.

Corepiscopos wear a black or a purple robe with a purple belt. Corepiscopos and above have hand-held crosses. Monks or rambans wear a &quot;masnapso&quot;, a hood.

Bishops usually wear a black or a red robe with a red belt. They should not wear a red robe in the presence of the patriarch, who wears a red robe. Bishops visiting a diocese outside their jurisdiction also wear black robes in deference to the bishop of the diocese, who would wear red robes.

==== Ceremonial ====
A &quot;Mawdyono&quot; Deacon wears a white robe called &quot;kutino&quot;, symbolizing purity. &quot;Mzamrono&quot; and ascending ranks of deacons wear the &quot;kutino&quot; and a &quot;uroro&quot; (Orarion) in their respective shapes. The deaconess wears a &quot;uroro&quot; hanging down from the shoulder in the manner of an archdeacon.

Priests have ceremonial shoes which are called &quot;msone&quot;. Without wearing these shoes, a priest cannot distribute Eucharist to the faithful. The priest also wears the &quot;Hamniko&quot; or stole which is worn over the white robe. Then he wears a girdle called &quot;zenoro&quot;, and &quot;zende&quot;, meaning sleeves. A cope called &quot;phayno&quot; is worn over these vestments.

If the celebrant is a bishop, he wears a &quot;veil-mitre&quot; over the masnapso. &quot;Batrashil&quot;, or pallium, is worn over the &quot;phayno&quot; by bishops and corepiscopas wear a half cope over the phayno, like &quot;hamnikho&quot; worn by priests. They carry a crosier stylised with serpents representing the staff of Moses during sacraments. 

== Demography ==

The patriarchate was initially established in Antioch (present-day Syria, Turkey, and Iraq), due to the persecutions by Romans followed by Muslim Arabs. The patriarchate was seated in Mor Hananyo Monastery, Mardin, in the Ottoman Empire (1160–1933); following Homs (1933–1959); and Damascus, Syria, since 1959. Historically, the followers of the church are mainly ethnic Assyrians/Syriacs who constitute the indigenous pre-Arab populations of modern Syria, Iraq and southeastern Turkey.A diaspora has also spread from the Levant, Iraq, and Turkey throughout the world, notably in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria, France, United States, Canada, Guatemala, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.

It is estimated that the church has 600,000 Syriac adherents, in addition to 2 million members of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church and their own ethnic diaspora in India. There is also a large Syriac community among Mayan converts in Guatemala and South America numbering up to 1.5 million. According to scholar James Minahan around 26% of the Assyrian people belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church.

The Syriac population in Turkey is growing due to refugees from Syria and Iraq fleeing ISIS, as well as members of the diaspora returning to rebuild their homes after leaving during the Turkey-PKK conflict (1978). The village of Kafro has been repopulated by Syriacs from Germany and Switzerland.

In the Syriac diaspora, there are approximately 80,000 members in the United States, 80,000 in Sweden, 100,000 in Germany, 15,000 in the Netherlands, 200,000 members in Brazil, Switzerland, and Austria.

== Jurisdiction of the patriarchate ==
The Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch originally covered the whole region of the Middle East and India. In recent centuries, its parishioners started to emigrate to other countries over the world. Today, the Syriac Orthodox Church has several archdioceses and patriarchal vicariates (exarchates) in many countries covering six continents. The church&#x27;s members are divided into 26 Archdioceses, and 13 Patriarchal Vicariates.

==== Jacobite Syrian Christian Church ====

The Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, one of the Saint Thomas Christian churches in India, is an integral part of the Syriac Orthodox Church, with the Patriarch of Antioch as its supreme head. The local head of the church in Malankara (Kerala) was the late Baselios Thomas I, ordained by Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas. The headquarters of the church in India is at Puthencruz, Ernakulam, Kerala in South India. Simhasana Churches and the Honavar Mission are under the direct control of Patriarch. Historically, the St. Thomas Christians were part of the Church of the East, based in Persia which was under the Patriarch of Antioch. After the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon(410 AD.), they were reunited with Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch 1652. Syriac monks Mar Sabor and Mar Proth arrived at Malankara between the eighth and ninth centuries from Persia. They established churches in Quilon, Kadamattom, Kayamkulam, Udayamperoor, and Akaparambu.

The Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church is an independent reformed church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan and its first Reforming Metropolitan Mathews Athanasius was ordained by Ignatius Elias II in 1842.

== Ecumenical relations ==

The Syriac Orthodox Church is active in ecumenical dialogues with various churches, including the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Anglican Communion, Syriac Church of the East, and other Christian denominations. The Church is an active member of the World Council of Churches since 1960 and Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas was one of the former presidents of WCC. It has also been involved in the Middle East Council of Churches since 1974. 

=== Catholic Church ===
There are common Christological and pastoral agreements with the Catholic Church by the 20th century as the Chalcedonian schism was not seen with the same relevance, and from several meetings between the authorities of the Catholic Church and the Oriental Orthodoxy, reconciling declarations emerged in the common statements of the Patriarch Ignatius Jacob III and Pope Paul VI in 1971, Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas and Pope John Paul II in 1984:

The precise differences in theology that caused the Chalcedonian controversy is said to have arisen &quot;&quot;only because of differences in terminology and culture and in the various formulae adopted by different theological schools to express the same matter&quot;, according to a common declaration statement between Patriarch Ignatius Jacob III and Pope Paul VI on Wednesday 27 October 1971. In 2015, Pope Francis addressed the Syriac Orthodox Church as &quot;a Church of Martyrs&quot; &quot; welcoming the visit of Ignatius Aphrem II to Holy See. In 2015, Ignatius Aphrem II visited Patriarch Kirill of Moscow of the Russian Orthodox Church and discussed prospects of bilateral and theological dialogue existing since the late 1980s. Since 1998, representatives of SOC, together with representatives of other Oriental Orthodox Churches, participate in the Ecumenical dialogue, and also in various forms of the Interfaith dialogue.

<text>Cryobiology is the branch of biology that studies the effects of low temperatures on living things within Earth&#x27;s cryosphere or in science. The word cryobiology is derived from the Greek words κρῧος [kryos], &quot;cold&quot;, βίος [bios], &quot;life&quot;, and λόγος [logos], &quot;word&quot;. In practice, cryobiology is the study of biological material or systems at temperatures below normal. Materials or systems studied may include proteins, cells, tissues, organs, or whole organisms. Temperatures may range from moderately hypothermic conditions to cryogenic temperatures.

== Areas of study ==
At least six major areas of cryobiology can be identified: 1) study of cold-adaptation of microorganisms, plants (cold hardiness), and animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates (including hibernation), 2) cryopreservation of cells, tissues, gametes, and embryos of animal and human origin for (medical) purposes of long-term storage by cooling to temperatures below the freezing point of water. This usually requires the addition of substances which protect the cells during freezing and thawing (cryoprotectants), 3) preservation of organs under hypothermic conditions for transplantation, 4) lyophilization (freeze-drying) of pharmaceuticals, 5) cryosurgery, a (minimally) invasive approach for the destruction of unhealthy tissue using cryogenic gases/fluids, and 6) physics of supercooling, ice nucleation/growth and mechanical engineering aspects of heat transfer during cooling and warming, as applied to biological systems. Cryobiology would include cryonics, the low temperature preservation of humans and mammals with the intention of future revival, although this is not part of mainstream cryobiology, depending heavily on speculative technology yet to be invented. Several of these areas of study rely on cryogenics, the branch of physics and engineering that studies the production and use of very low temperatures.

==Cryopreservation in nature==
Many living organisms are able to tolerate prolonged periods of time at temperatures below the freezing point of water. Most living organisms accumulate cryoprotectants such as antinucleating proteins, polyols, and glucose to protect themselves against frost damage by sharp ice crystals. Most plants, in particular, can safely reach temperatures of −4 °C to −12 °C.

===Bacteria===
Three species of bacteria, &quot;Carnobacterium pleistocenium&quot;, &quot;Chryseobacterium greenlandensis&quot;, and &quot;Herminiimonas glaciei&quot;, have reportedly been revived after surviving for thousands of years frozen in ice.
Certain bacteria, notably &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;, produce specialized proteins that serve as potent ice nucleators, which they use to force ice formation on the surface of various fruits and plants at about −2 °C. The freezing causes injuries in the epithelia and makes the nutrients in the underlying plant tissues available to the bacteria. &quot;Listeria&quot; grows slowly in temperatures as low as -1.5 °C and persists for some time in frozen foods.

===Plants===
Many plants undergo a process called hardening which allows them to survive temperatures below 0 °C for weeks to months. Cryobiology of plants explores the cellular and molecular adaptations plants develop to survive subzero temperatures, such as antifreeze proteins (AFP) and changes in membrane composition. Cryopreservation is a critical technique in plant cryobiology, used for the long-term storage of genetic material and the preservation of endangered species by maintaining plant tissues or seeds in liquid nitrogen. Research in this area aims to enhance agricultural productivity in cold climates, improve the storage of plant genetic resources, and understand the impacts of climate change on plant biodiversity.

===Animals===

====Invertebrates====
Nematodes that survive below 0 °C include &quot;Trichostrongylus colubriformis&quot; and &quot;Panagrolaimus davidi&quot;. Cockroach nymphs (&quot;Periplaneta japonica&quot;) survive short periods of freezing at -6 to -8 °C. The red flat bark beetle (&quot;Cucujus clavipes&quot;) can survive after being frozen to -150 °C. The fungus gnat &quot;Exechia nugatoria&quot; can survive after being frozen to -50 °C, by a unique mechanism whereby ice crystals form in the body but not the head. Another freeze-tolerant beetle is &quot;Upis ceramboides&quot;. See insect winter ecology and antifreeze protein. Another invertebrate that is briefly tolerant to temperatures down to -273 °C is the tardigrade.

The larvae of &quot;Haemonchus contortus&quot;, a nematode, can survive 44 weeks frozen at -196 °C.

====Vertebrates====
For the wood frog (&quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;), in the winter, as much as 45% of its body may freeze and turn to ice. &quot;Ice crystals form beneath the skin and become interspersed among the body&#x27;s skeletal muscles. During the freeze, the frog&#x27;s breathing, blood flow, and heartbeat cease. Freezing is made possible by specialized proteins and glucose, which prevent intracellular freezing and dehydration.&quot; The wood frog can survive up to 11 days frozen at -4 °C.

Other vertebrates that survive at body temperatures below 0 °C include painted turtles (&quot;Chrysemys picta&quot;), gray tree frogs (&quot;Hyla versicolor&quot;), moor frogs (Rana arvalis), box turtles (&quot;Terrapene carolina&quot; - 48 hours at -2 °C), spring peeper (&quot;Pseudacris crucifer&quot;), garter snakes (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis&quot;- 24 hours at -1.5 °C), the chorus frog (&quot;Pseudacris triseriata&quot;), Siberian salamander (&quot;Salamandrella keyserlingii&quot; - 24 hours at -15.3 °C), European common lizard (&quot;Lacerta vivipara&quot;) and Antarctic fish such as &quot;Pagothenia borchgrevinki&quot;. Antifreeze proteins cloned from such fish have been used to confer frost-resistance on transgenic plants.

Hibernating Arctic ground squirrels may have abdominal temperatures as low as −2.9 °C (26.8 °F), maintaining subzero abdominal temperatures for more than three weeks at a time, although the temperatures at the head and neck remain at 0 °C or above.

==Applied cryobiology==

===Historical background===

Cryobiology history can be traced back to antiquity. As early as in 2500 BC, low temperatures were used in Egypt in medicine. The use of cold was recommended by Hippocrates to stop bleeding and swelling. With the emergence of modern science, Robert Boyle studied the effects of low temperatures on animals.

In 1949, bull semen was cryopreserved for the first time by a team of scientists led by Christopher Polge. This led to a much wider use of cryopreservation today, with many organs, tissues and cells routinely stored at low temperatures. Large organs such as hearts are usually stored and transported, for short times only, at cool but not freezing temperatures for transplantation. Cell suspensions (like blood and semen) and thin tissue sections can sometimes be stored almost indefinitely in liquid nitrogen temperature (cryopreservation). Human sperm, eggs, and embryos are routinely stored in fertility research and treatments. Controlled-rate and slow freezing are well established techniques pioneered in the early 1970s which enabled the first human embryo frozen birth (Zoe Leyland) in 1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable steps, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human, animal, and cell biology – &#x27;freezing down&#x27; a sample to better preserve it for eventual thawing, before it is deep frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen. Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo, sperm, stem cells, and general tissue preservation in hospitals, veterinary practices, and research labs. The number of live births from &#x27;slow frozen&#x27; embryos is some 300,000 to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilized births. Dr Christopher Chen, Australia, reported the world’s first pregnancy using slow-frozen oocytes from a British controlled-rate freezer in 1986.

Cryosurgery (intended and controlled tissue destruction by ice formation) was carried out by James Arnott in 1845 in an operation on a patient with cancer.

===Preservation techniques===

Cryobiology as an applied science is primarily concerned with low-temperature preservation. Hypothermic storage is typically above 0 °C but below normothermic (32 °C to 37 °C) mammalian temperatures. Storage by cryopreservation, on the other hand, will be in the −80 to −196 °C temperature range. Organs, and tissues are more frequently the objects of hypothermic storage, whereas single cells have been the most common objects cryopreserved.

A rule of thumb in hypothermic storage is that every 10 °C reduction in temperature is accompanied by a 50% decrease in oxygen consumption. Although hibernating animals have adapted mechanisms to avoid metabolic imbalances associated with hypothermia, hypothermic organs, and tissues being maintained for transplantation require special preservation solutions to counter acidosis, depressed sodium pump activity. and increased intracellular calcium. Special organ preservation solutions such as Viaspan (University of Wisconsin solution), HTK, and Celsior have been designed for this purpose. These solutions also contain ingredients to minimize damage by free radicals, prevent edema, compensate for ATP loss, etc.

Cryopreservation of cells is guided by the &quot;two-factor hypothesis&quot; of American cryobiologist Peter Mazur, which states that excessively rapid cooling kills cells by intracellular ice formation and excessively slow cooling kills cells by either electrolyte toxicity or mechanical crushing. During slow cooling, ice forms extracellularly, causing water to osmotically leave cells, thereby dehydrating them. Intracellular ice can be much more damaging than extracellular ice.

For red blood cells, the optimum cooling rate is very rapid (nearly 100 °C per second), whereas for stem cells the optimum cooling rate is very slow (1 °C per minute). Cryoprotectants, such as dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol, are used to protect cells from freezing. A variety of cell types are protected by 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Cryobiologists attempt to optimize cryoprotectant concentration (minimizing both ice formation and toxicity) and cooling rate. Cells may be cooled at an optimum rate to a temperature between −30 and −40 °C before being plunged into liquid nitrogen.

Slow cooling methods rely on the fact that cells contain few nucleating agents, but contain naturally occurring vitrifying substances that can prevent ice formation in cells that have been moderately dehydrated. Some cryobiologists are seeking mixtures of cryoprotectants for full vitrification (zero ice formation) in preservation of cells, tissues, and organs. Vitrification methods pose a challenge in the requirement to search for cryoprotectant mixtures that can minimize toxicity.

===In humans===
Human gametes and two-, four- and eight-cell embryos can survive cryopreservation at -196 °C for 10 years under well-controlled laboratory conditions.

Cryopreservation in humans with regards to infertility involves preservation of embryos, sperm, or oocytes via freezing. Conception, &quot;in vitro&quot;, is attempted when the sperm is thawed and introduced to the &#x27;fresh&#x27; eggs, the frozen eggs are thawed and sperm is placed with the eggs and together they are placed back into the uterus or a frozen embryo is introduced to the uterus. Vitrification has flaws and is not as reliable or proven as freezing fertilized sperm, eggs, or embryos as traditional slow freezing methods because eggs alone are extremely sensitive to temperature. Many researchers are also freezing ovarian tissue in conjunction with the eggs in hopes that the ovarian tissue can be transplanted back into the uterus, stimulating normal ovulation cycles. In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and cryopreserved in a (Planer, UK) controlled-rate freezer and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.

Therapeutic hypothermia, e.g. during heart surgery on a &quot;cold&quot; heart (generated by cold perfusion without any ice formation) allows for much longer operations and improves recovery rates for patients.

==Scientific societies==
The Society for Cryobiology was founded in 1964 to bring together those from the biological, medical, and physical sciences who have a common interest in the effects of low temperatures on biological systems. As of 2007, the Society for Cryobiology had about 280 members from around the world, and one-half of them are US-based. The purpose of the Society is to promote scientific research in low temperature biology, to improve scientific understanding in this field, and to disseminate and apply this knowledge to the benefit of mankind. The Society requires of all its members the highest ethical and scientific standards in the performance of their professional activities. According to the Society&#x27;s bylaws, membership may be refused to applicants whose conduct is deemed detrimental to the Society; in 1982, the bylaws were amended explicitly to exclude &quot;any practice or application of freezing deceased persons in the anticipation of their reanimation&quot;, over the objections of some members who were cryonicists, such as Jerry Leaf. The Society organizes an annual scientific meeting dedicated to all aspects of low-temperature biology. This international meeting offers opportunities for presentation and discussion of the most up-to-date research in cryobiology, as well as reviewing specific aspects through symposia and workshops. Members are also kept informed of news and forthcoming meetings through the Society newsletter, &quot;News Notes&quot;. The 2011–2012 president of the Society for Cryobiology was John H. Crowe.

The Society for Low Temperature Biology was founded in 1964 and became a registered charity in 2003 with the purpose of promoting research into the effects of low temperatures on all types of organisms and their constituent cells, tissues, and organs. As of 2006, the society had around 130 (mostly British and European) members and holds at least one annual general meeting. The program usually includes both a symposium on a topical subject and a session of free communications on any aspect of low-temperature biology. Recent symposia have included long-term stability, preservation of aquatic organisms, cryopreservation of embryos and gametes, preservation of plants, low-temperature microscopy, vitrification (glass formation of aqueous systems during cooling), freeze drying and tissue banking. Members are informed through the Society Newsletter, which is presently published three times a year. 

== Journals ==
&quot;Cryobiology&quot; (publisher: Elsevier) is the foremost scientific publication in this area, with about 60 refereed contributions published each year. Articles concern any aspect of low-temperature biology and medicine (e.g. freezing, freeze-drying, hibernation, cold tolerance and adaptation, cryoprotective compounds, medical applications of reduced temperature, cryosurgery, hypothermia, and perfusion of organs).

&quot;Cryo Letters&quot; is an independent UK-based rapid communication journal which publishes papers on the effects produced by low temperatures on a wide variety of biophysical and biological processes, or studies involving low-temperature techniques in the investigation of biological and ecological topics.

&quot;Biopreservation and Biobanking&quot; (formerly Cell Preservation Technology) is a peer-reviewed quarterly scientific journal published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. dedicated to the diverse spectrum of preservation technologies including cryopreservation, dry-state (anhydrobiosis), and glassy-state and hypothermic maintenance. &quot;Cell Preservation Technology&quot; has been renamed &quot;Biopreservation and Biobanking&quot; and is the official journal of International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories.

&quot;Problems of Cryobiology and Cryomedicine &quot; (formerly &#x27;Kriobiologiya&#x27; (1985-1990) and &#x27;Problems of Cryobiology&#x27;(1991-2012) ) published by Institute for Problems of Cryobiology and Cryomedicine. The journal covers all topics related to low temperature biology, medicine and engineering.

<doc id="219287" wikidata="Q3778211" url="?curid=219287" title="Legal person">
<text>In law, a legal person is any person or legal entity that can do the things a human person is usually able to do in law – such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on. The reason for the term &quot;&quot;legal&quot; person&quot; is that some legal persons are not human persons: companies and corporations (i.e., business entities) are &quot;persons&quot; legally speaking (they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do), but they are not, in a literal sense, (human beings).

Legal personhood is a prerequisite to legal capacity (the ability of any legal person to amend – i.e. enter into, transfer, etc. – rights and obligations), it is a prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its own name.

== History ==
The concept of legal personhood for organizations of people is at least as old as Ancient Rome: a variety of collegial institutions enjoyed the benefit under Roman law.

The doctrine has been attributed to Pope Innocent IV, who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of &quot;persona ficta&quot; as it is called in Latin. In canon law, the doctrine of &quot;persona ficta&quot; allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty. Another effect of this was that, as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of delict due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities. This effectively moved such liability to persons acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since persons were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of negligence and able to be excommunicated.

In the common law tradition, only a person could possess legal rights. To allow them to function, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights—the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).

Since the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of personal jurisdiction). In &quot;Louisville, C. &amp; C.R. Co. v. Letson&quot;, 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is &quot;capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.&quot; Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that &quot;those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,&quot; should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation&#x27;s State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.

==Forms==

There are two kinds of legal persons: human and non-human. In law, a human person is called a natural person (sometimes also a physical person), and a non-human person is called a juridical person (sometimes also a &quot;juridic&quot;, &quot;juristic&quot;, &quot;artificial&quot;, &quot;legal&quot;, or &quot;fictitious person&quot;, ).

Juridical persons are entities such as corporations, firms (in some jurisdictions), and many government agencies. For most purposes they are treated in law as if they were human persons.

While natural persons acquire legal personality simply by being born, juridical persons must have legal personality conferred on them by a legal process and, for this reason, that they are sometimes called &quot;artificial&quot; persons. In the most common case (incorporating a business), legal personality is usually acquired by registration with a government agency set up for the purpose. In other cases legal personhood may result from legislation, such as the manner in which the Charity Commission was created in the UK.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 advocates for the provision of legal identity for all natural persons, including birth registration by 2030 as part of the 2030 Agenda.

== Juridical persons ==
Artificial personality, juridical personality, or juristic personality is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law as having the status of personhood.

A juridical or artificial person (; also juristic person) has a legal name and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and liabilities in law, similar to those of a natural person. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental legal fiction. It is pertinent to the philosophy of law, as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation (corporations law).

Juridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (&quot;universitas personarum&quot;) to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many jurisdictions, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its shareholders). They may sue and be sued, enter into contracts, incur debt, and own property. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may shield its members from personal liability.

In some common law jurisdictions a distinction is drawn between &quot;corporation aggregate&quot; (such as a company, which is composed of a number of members) and a &quot;corporation sole&quot;, which is a public office of legal personality separated from the individual holding the office (these entities have separate legal personality). Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury is a corporation sole), but a number of other public offices are now formed as corporations sole.

The concept of juridical personality is not absolute. &quot;Piercing the corporate veil&quot; refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as agents involved in a company action or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or public limited company are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation&#x27;s members or directors.

The concept of a juridical person is now central to Western law in both common-law and civil-law countries, but it is also found in virtually every other legal system.

=== Examples ===
Some examples of juridical persons include:
* Cooperatives (co-ops), business organization owned and democratically operated by a group of individuals for their mutual benefit
* Corporations are bodies corporate created by statute or charter. A corporation sole is a corporation constituted by a single member, in a particular capacity, and that person&#x27;s successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some legal benefit or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or The Crown in the Commonwealth realms. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by more than one member.
** Municipal corporations (municipalities) are created by statutes. Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons, including European economic interest groupings (EEIGs).
* Unincorporated associations, that is aggregates of two or more persons, are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions.
* Partnerships, an aggregate of two or more persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having an independent legal personality.
* Family can be treated as a legal person.
* Companies are corporations – the term often refers to a business association that carries on an industrial enterprise, although companies may take other forms, such as trade unions, unlimited companies, trusts, and funds. Limited liability companies—be they a private company limited by guarantee, private company limited by shares, or public limited company—are entities having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Different types have a complex variety of advantages and disadvantages.
* Sovereign states are legal persons.
* In the international legal system, various organizations possess legal personality. These include intergovernmental organizations (the United Nations, the Council of Europe) and some other international organizations (including the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a religious order).
* The European Union (EU) has legal personality since the Lisbon Treaty entered into force on 1 December 2009. That the EU has legal personality is a prerequisite for the EU to join the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, in 2014, the EU decided not to be bound by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.
* Temples, in some legal systems, have separate legal personality.
* The Whanganui River was granted legal personality in March 2017 under New Zealand law because the Whanganui Māori tribe regard the river as their ancestor.
* Also, in March 2017, the High Court of Uttarakhand declared the Ganges River a legal &quot;person&quot; in a move that according to one newspaper, &quot;could help in efforts to clean the pollution-choked rivers&quot;. As of 6 April 2017, the ruling has been commented on in Indian newspapers to be hard to enforce, with assertions that experts do not anticipate immediate benefits, that the ruling is &quot;hardly game changing&quot;, that experts believe &quot;any follow-up action is unlikely&quot;, and that the &quot;judgment is deficient to the extent it acted without hearing others (in states outside Uttarakhand) who have stakes in the matter&quot;. The Supreme Court of India overturned the decision of the High Court of Uttarakhand in July 2017.

Not all organizations have legal personality. For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body which they are a part of.

==Worldwide==

=== India ===
Indian law defines two types of &quot;legal person&quot;, the human beings as well as certain non-human entities which are given the same legal judicial personality as human beings. The non-human entities given the &quot;legal person&quot; status by the law &quot;have rights and co-relative duties; they can sue and be sued, can possess and transfer property&quot;. Since these non-human entities are &quot;voiceless&quot; they are legally represented &quot;through guardians and representatives&quot; to claim their legal rights and to fulfill their legal duties and responsibilities. Specific non-human entities given the status of &quot;legal person&quot; include &quot;corporate personality, body politic, charitable unions etc,&quot; as well as trust estates, deities, temples, churches, mosques, hospitals, universities, colleges, banks, railways, municipalities, and gram panchayats (village councils), rivers, all animals and birds.

====Corporates and trusts====
In court cases regarding corporates, the shareholders are not responsible for the company&#x27;s debts but the company itself being a &quot;legal person&quot; is liable to repay those debts or be sued for the non-repayment of debts.

====Animal kingdom====
In court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of &quot;legal person&quot; and humans have the legal duty to act as &quot;loco parentis&quot; towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children. A court while deciding the &quot;Animal Welfare Board of India vs Nagaraja&quot; case in 2014 mandated that animals are also entitled to the fundamental right to freedom enshrined in the Article 21 of Constitution of India i.e. right to life, personal liberty and the right to die with dignity (passive euthanasia). In another case, a court in Uttarakhand state mandated that animals have the same rights as humans. In another case of cow-smuggling, the Punjab and Haryana High Court mandated that &quot;entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic&quot; species has a &quot;distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person&quot; and humans are &quot;loco parentis&quot; while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and load carrying animals must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope.

====Religious deities====
In court cases regarding religious entities, the deity (deity or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred) is also a &quot;legal person&quot; who can engage in legal cases through &quot;trustees&quot; or &quot;managing board in charge of the temple&quot;. Supreme Court of India (SC), while deciding Ayodhya case of Ram Janmabhoomi, decided in 2010 that the deity Rama in the specific temple was a &quot;legal entity&quot; entitled to be represented by their own lawyer appointed by the trustees acting on behalf of the deity. Similarly, in 2018 SC decided that the deity Ayyappan is a &quot;legal person&quot; with &quot;the right to privacy&quot; in the court case regarding the entry of women to Sabarimala shrine of Lord Ayyapan.

=====Shebaitship=====

Under the Indian law, the &quot;shebaitship&quot; is the property owned by the deity or idol as a &quot;legal person&quot;. Humans appointed to act on behalf of deity are called the &quot;shebait&quot;. A shebait acts as the guardian or custodian of deity to protect the right of deity and fulfill the legal duties of the deity. Shebait is similar to a trustee in case the deity or temple does have a legally registered trust or entity. Under the Hindu Law property gifted or offered as rituals or donations, etc absolutely belongs to the deity and not to the shebait. Case example are &quot;Profulla Chrone Requitte vs Satya Chorone Requitte, AIR 1979 SC 1682 (1686): (1979) 3 SCC 409: (1979) 3 SCR 431. (ii)&quot; and &quot;Shambhu Charan Shukla vs Thakur Ladli Radha Chandra Madan Gopalji Maharaj, AIR 1985 SC 905 (909): (1985) 2 SCC 524: (1985) 3 SCR 372&quot;.

====Natural entities such as rivers====
India and New Zealand both recognised the legal rights of rivers in 2017. In court cases regarding natural entities, the Uttarakhand High Court, mandated that the river Ganges and Yamuna as well as all water bodies are &quot;living entities&quot; i.e. &quot;legal person&quot; and appointed three humans as trustees to protect the rights of rivers against the pollution caused by the humans, e.g. &quot;pilgrims&#x27;s bathing rituals&quot;. The Supreme Court of India overturned the decision of the High Court of Uttarakhand in July 2017.

=== New Zealand ===
Section 28 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provides: &quot;... the provisions of this Bill of Rights apply, so far as practicable, for the benefit of all legal persons as well as for the benefit of all natural persons.&quot;

=== United States ===
In part based on the principle that legal persons are simply natural persons and their organizations, and in part based on the history of statutory interpretation of the word &quot;person&quot;, the US Supreme Court has repeatedly held that certain constitutional rights protect legal persons (such as corporations and other organizations). &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter&#x27;s comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that &quot;the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.&quot;

Later opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision. As a result, because of the First Amendment, Congress may not make a law restricting the free speech of a corporation or a political action group or dictating the coverage of a local newspaper, and because of the Due Process Clause, a state government may not take the property of a corporation without using due process of law and providing just compensation. These protections apply to all legal entities, not just corporations.

A prominent component of relevant case law is the Supreme Court decision &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, which ruled unconstitutional certain restrictions on corporate campaign spending during elections.

==== Case law ====
* In &quot;U.S. v. The Cooper Corp.&quot;, (1941) the court held that the United States government, as a juristic person, could sue under the Sherman Act. Section 7 of the act granted the right to sue only to persons. The corporate defendant, which was accused of illegally conspiring and colluding to raise prices on tires, argued that the U.S. government did not have power to enforce the act because the government was not a person. The court held that the term &quot;person&quot; includes the U.S. Government, and allowed the action against the collusive corporations to continue.
* In &quot;Cook County v. U.S. ex rel Chandler&quot;, (2003) the county was accused of violating a law which forbids &quot;any person&quot; from falsely obtaining research funds from the government. The county received a $5 million grant, but used it to conduct inappropriate tests on human subjects. The county argued that it could not be held liable because it was not a person. The court held that the county could be sued under the law as a legal person.
* In &quot;Rowland v. California Men&#x27;s Colony, Unit II Men&#x27;s Advisory Council&quot;, (1993) the court declined to extend certain rights to legal persons. The association of prisoners sought to proceed &quot;in forma pauperis&quot;. The court held that the right to sue &quot;in forma pauperis&quot; existed only for natural persons, not legal persons.

Other significant cases include:
* &quot;Paul v. Virginia&quot; (&quot;... in which the United States Supreme Court held that a corporation is not a citizen...&quot;)
* &quot;Netscape Communications Corp. v. Konrad&quot; for what it means for two entities to be separate

== Popular culture ==
In Act II, Scene 1 of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1889 opera, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Giuseppe Palmieri (who serves, jointly with his brother Marco, as King of Barataria) requests that he and his brother be also recognized individually so that they might each receive individual portions of food as they have &quot;two independent appetites&quot;. He is, however, turned down by the Court (made up of fellow Gondolieri) because the joint rule &quot;... is a legal person, and legal person are solemn things.&quot;

<text>The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair (also known as the 1939–1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair) was an international exposition at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, United States. The fair included exhibitions, activities, performances, films, art, and food presented by 62 nations, 35 U.S. states and territories, and 1,400 organizations and companies. Slightly more than 45 million people attended over two seasons. It was based on &quot;the world of tomorrow&quot;, with an opening slogan of &quot;Dawn of a New Day&quot;. The fairground consisted of seven color-coded zones, as well as two standalone focal exhibits. The fairground had about 375 buildings.

Plans for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair were first announced in September 1935, and the New York World&#x27;s Fair Corporation (WFC) began constructing the fairground in June 1936. The fair opened on April 30, 1939, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the first inauguration of George Washington. World War II began four months into the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, forcing some exhibits to close. The fair attracted over 45 million visitors and ultimately recouped only 32% of its original cost. After the fair ended on October 27, 1940, most pavilions were demolished or removed, though some buildings were relocated or retained for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

The fair hosted many activities and cultural events. Participating governments, businesses, and organizations were celebrated on specific theme days. Musical performances took place in conjunction with the fair, and sculptures and artworks were displayed throughout the fairground and within pavilions. The fairground also displayed consumer products, including electronic devices, and there were dozens of restaurants and concession stands. The exposition spurred increased spending in New York City and indirectly influenced Queens&#x27; further development. Artifacts from the fair still exist, and the event has also been dramatized in media.

==Development==
New York City had hosted the United States&#x27; first world&#x27;s fair, the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, in 1853–1854. The city did not host another world&#x27;s fair for 85 years. The site of the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, was originally a natural wetland straddling the Flushing River before becoming an ash dump in the early 20th century. New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses first conceived the idea of developing a large park in Flushing Meadows in the 1920s. Although the neighborhoods around Flushing Meadows contained residential developments, the meadow itself remained undeveloped and isolated. Meanwhile, the 1933 Century of Progress exposition in Chicago had boosted that city&#x27;s economy, prompting businesspeople in New York City to consider a similar fair.

=== Planning ===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that the civil engineer Joseph Shadgen came up with the idea for the World&#x27;s Fair in 1934, while talking with his daughter. By early 1935, a group led by the municipal reformer George McAneny was considering an international exposition in New York City in 1939. Though the date coincided with the 150th anniversary of George Washington&#x27;s first inauguration, Moses said the date was &quot;an excuse and not the reason&quot; for the fair. That September, the group announced plans to spend $40 million to host an exhibition at the Flushing Meadows site. The Flushing Meadows site had been selected because of its large size and central location, and because the city already owned nearby. The New York City Board of Estimate approved the use of Flushing Meadows as a fairground on September 23, and Moses directed municipal draftsmen to survey the site. 

Mayor Fiorello La Guardia pledged financial support for the fair that October, and the New York World&#x27;s Fair Corporation (WFC) was formed to oversee the exposition on October 22, 1936. The WFC elected McAneny as its president, and two contractors were hired that December to conduct preliminary surveys. State lawmaker Herbert Brownell Jr. introduced legislation in January 1936, which allowed the WFC to lease Flushing Meadows from the city government. By then, the fair was estimated to cost $45 million. To oversee the fair&#x27;s development, McAneny organized a committee, which initially advocated for a single massive building. The project remained stalled during early 1936, but the New York State Legislature ultimately voted in April to allow the city to lease out Flushing Meadows.

Grover Whalen replaced McAneny as the WFC&#x27;s chairman in April 1936 and was later elected as the agency&#x27;s full-time president. J. Franklin Bell drew preliminary plans for the fair, and the WFC appointed seven men to devise a plan for the fairground. At the end of the month, the city government announced plans to sell $7 million in bonds, and the state pledged $4.125 million for the project. In addition, the WFC issued $26,862,800 in bonds. The New York City Board of Estimate appropriated $308,020 to begin landscaping the site that May, and city officials acquired another through eminent domain. The WFC dedicated the fairground site on June 4, 1936, shortly before the city finalized its lease of Flushing Meadows to the WFC.

=== Construction ===
Work on the World&#x27;s Fair site began on June 16, 1936, and a groundbreaking ceremony for the fairground took place on June 29. The WFC established seven departments and thirteen committees to coordinate the fair&#x27;s development. The fair was planned to employ 35,000 people. The construction of the fairground involved leveling the ash mounds, excavating Meadow and Willow lakes, and diverting much of the Flushing River into underground culverts. The dirt from the lake sites was used as additional topsoil for the park. Workers also transported soil from Westchester County, New York, to the fairground. Four hundred fifty workers were employed on three eight-hour shifts. The rebuilt landscape was to be retained after the fair. The city, state, and federal governments also worked on 48 infrastructure-improvement projects, such as highway and landscaping projects, for the fair.

To promote the fair, the WFC established advisory committees with members from every U.S. state. Several baseball teams wore patches promoting the fair during the 1938 Major League Baseball season, while the businessman Howard Hughes named an airplane after the fair and flew it around the world in 1938. Helen Huntington Hull led a women&#x27;s committee that helped promote and develop the fair. New York license plates from 1938 were supposed to have slogans advertising the fair, but a city judge deemed the slogans unconstitutional. New York license plates from 1939 and 1940 also advertised the fair. Local retailers also sold more than $40 million worth of merchandise with World&#x27;s Fair motifs, and the U.S. government issued stamps depicting the fair&#x27;s Trylon and Perisphere. World leaders delivered &quot;greetings to the fair&quot; as part of the &quot;Salute of the Nations&quot; radio program, and the WFC also broadcast 15-minute-long &quot;invitations to the fair&quot;, featuring musical entertainments and a speech by Gibson. In addition, the WFC distributed a promotional film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to the Fair.&quot;

==== 1936 and 1937 ====

The WFC&#x27;s board of design reviewed several proposed master plans for the site, and the corporation had relocated the last occupants of the fairground site by August 1936. The WFC launched a design competition for several pavilions that September and selected several winning designs two months later. The WFC announced details of the fair&#x27;s master plan that October, which called for a $125 million exposition themed to &quot;the world of tomorrow&quot;. Later that month, the WFC signed construction contracts for the fairground&#x27;s first building. At that point, only a small number of fairground buildings had been approved.

In November 1936, France became the first nation to announce its participation, and the city government began selling bonds for the fair. The International Convention Bureau endorsed the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, allowing the bureau&#x27;s 21 member countries to host exhibits there. Lehman also invited the governors of other U.S. states. By the beginning of 1937, eleven hundred concessionaires had applied for concessions at the fair, and nine buildings were under construction. The WFC unveiled a model of the fairground at its Empire State Building headquarters that March. Workers had finished grading and filling the World&#x27;s Fair site by April, and they began planting trees. That month, AT&amp;T became the first company to lease a pavilion at the fair, and work officially began on the first building, the administration structure. In addition, the WFC began auctioning off the fairground&#x27;s concession spaces, and workers also began planting trees in early 1937.

Whalen announced plans in June 1937 for a amusement zone at the south end of the fairground, and work on the first non-commercial pavilion, the Temple of Peace, began in July. By then, 89 buildings were under construction, and 86% of the fairground sites had been leased. Utah became the first U.S. state to lease space in the fair&#x27;s Hall of States that September, while Missouri was the first state to lease space for a standalone building. Whalen also traveled to Europe to invite European countries to the fair. Various fairground buildings were being developed, as well as the Trylon and Perisphere, the fair&#x27;s icons. That December, the Ford Motor Company became the first automobile manufacturer to lease space at the fair; by then, the WFC had received commitments from 60 nations.

==== 1938 and 1939 ====

The WFC awarded the first fair concession in January 1938. At that point, Whalen was making plans for the fair&#x27;s opening ceremony. Whalen wanted to have 100 buildings under construction by the end of April, and the WFC planned to spend $10 million upgrading the utilities. Work on the Perisphere, the fair&#x27;s theme building, began in early April, along with work on the first foreign-government structure. The same month, the WFC leased out the last vacant sites in the fair&#x27;s Government Zone. The city hosted a parade with one million spectators on April 30, 1938, exactly a year before the planned opening, and the WFC hosted a fireworks show the next week. That May, the WFC began allowing visitors to inspect the fairground on weekends for a fee. The structures were all supposed to be completed by the end of March 1939, giving one month for exhibitors to fit their pavilions out.

The WFC awarded contracts to 30 amusement-ride operators in June 1938, following months of disputes over the concessions. The WFC continued to issue concessions for eateries and amusement rides. By late 1938, workers were painting murals on buildings, and the subway stations serving the fairground were being completed. That October, the Heinz Dome became the first commercial exhibit to be completed, and 80% of the fairground&#x27;s of exhibit space had been leased. Leasing lagged in the amusement zone; by that December, only two-thirds of the ride concessions had been leased.

Whalen announced in January 1939 that the fairground was more than 90% complete, though work on one-third of the amusement concessions had not started. The fair had attracted 1,300 industrial exhibitors and 70 concessionaires. In addition, 62 nations and 35 U.S. states or territories had leased space at the fair. That March, Whalen announced plans to spend $1 million on shows and miniature villages in the Amusement Area. The lights on the fairground were first turned on three weeks before the fair&#x27;s scheduled opening. In conjunction with the fair, La Guardia issued a proclamation declaring April 1939 as &quot;Dress Up and Paint Up Month&quot; in New York City. Sixteen thousand workers were putting final touches on the site by mid-April, and foreign nations were delivering $100 million worth of exhibits to the fair. Thousands of additional workers were employed toward the end of April.

==Operation==
The fairground ultimately cost , and Whalen anticipated that 60 million people would visit. Five major newsreel companies were hired to provide newsreel coverage, and the Crosley Corporation and WNYC both had radio broadcasting studios there. The WFC hired Exposition Publications to print a guidebook, souvenir book, and daily programs, and it promoted 17 other books and news stories about the fair. The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) retroactively recognized the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair as an official World Expo, even though the BIE&#x27;s rules permitted official Expos to run for only one year.

Whalen agreed to hire only union laborers to install exhibits on the fairground; in exchange, several trade unions agreed to buy the WFC&#x27;s bonds. Free emergency services were provided on site by dozens of doctors and nurses, and there were six first-aid stations, a mobile X-ray machine, and five ambulances. The fairground was covered by a temporary New York City Police Department (NYPD) precinct and a temporary New York City Fire Department (FDNY) battalion. In addition, the Queens County Court was temporarily expanded to hear criminal cases relating to the fair.

=== 1939 season ===

==== Preparations and opening ====

For the 1939 season, the WFC charged 75 cents per adult and 25 cents per child; the agency also sold season tickets, multi-visit tickets, and souvenir ticket books. Manhattan&#x27;s borough president, Stanley M. Isaacs, had wanted the WFC to give students free admission, but Moses opposed the proposal. Whalen began selling discounted advance tickets in February 1939, which were sold by 1,000 retailers in the New York metropolitan area. Journalists could visit the fairground free of charge, but no other free tickets were distributed. The WFC had to print additional souvenir books due to high demand. Though there was an upcharge fee for some of the exhibits and attractions, three-fourths of the original attractions did not charge any extra fees.

On April 30, 1939, exactly 150 years after Washington&#x27;s first inauguration, the fair formally opened with a speech by President Roosevelt. The fair received 600,000 visitors on its first day, far short of the one million visitors that the WFC had predicted. Many major attractions in the Amusement Area were incomplete, and only 80% of the structures were ready. The fair accommodated one million visitors in its first four days. By mid-May, the fair was 90% finished, but many of the amusement attractions were still incomplete. The WFC&#x27;s operations department oversaw the remaining work.

==== May to October ====
In early May, the WFC began selling 10-cent children&#x27;s tickets once a week, which helped increase children&#x27;s attendance significantly. At La Guardia&#x27;s behest, the New York City Board of Education operated guided tours in which school classes could visit the fair for free. The WFC opened more restaurants late that May. Several exhibitors alleged that labor unions had charged exorbitant prices for labor at the fair, and, due to concerns over sexually explicit content, several of the fair&#x27;s shows were raided. That June, the WFC established a committee to oversee the amusement area, and amusement concessionaires agreed to offer discounted ride tickets once a week. The WFC also sold discounted 50-cent tickets to organizations and businesses.

Lower-than-expected attendance prompted Whalen to fire hundreds of employees in July 1939, and there were also proposals to reduce performers&#x27; salaries. The same month, the WFC began selling discounted &quot;combination tickets&quot; with snacks and admission to multiple attractions, as well as &quot;bargain books&quot;, with food vouchers and admission tickets. At the request of amusement-ride operators, the WFC also considered reducing admission prices. At the beginning of August, admission was reduced during weekends, and the WFC started selling discounted tickets at night. With daily attendance averaging 129,000—less than half the original estimate of 270,000—the WFC was unsure if the fair would run for another season. By mid-August, the WFC was asking bondholders to lend more money, and the bondholders agreed to forgo their right to collect a portion of the fair&#x27;s admission revenue. A writer for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said local residents tended to avoid the fair&#x27;s restaurants and that the amusement area deterred visitors with more refined tastes.

In September 1939, the WFC began inviting foreign exhibitors to return for the second season, and it notified the city government of its intention to extend its lease. The Carrier Corporation was the first industrial exhibitor to renew its lease. While numerous foreign exhibitors curtailed their operations, Whalen traveled to Europe, asking exhibitors to return for the following season. In the final weeks of the 1939 season, visitors increasingly came from outside the New York City area. The final week was celebrated with a Mardi Gras–themed festival. When the first season ended on October 31, 1939, the WFC had recorded 25,817,265 paying guests. Attendance had exceeded 100,000 on 114 days, and the fair employed up to 25,000 people during that season. At the end of the first season, the WFC owed bondholders $23.5 million, and it had $1.13 million on hand. In addition, the fair had handled 8.52 million phone calls and 3.3 million pieces of mail. Around 150 fairgoers had been arrested during the first season, only one of whom was charged with a felony.

=== Off-season ===

After the 1939 season ended, many exhibits were removed for safekeeping and the fairground&#x27;s utilities were turned off. Most of the fair&#x27;s 2,800 employees were reassigned to other positions, though the WFC hired a skeleton crew and allocated $3.3 million to maintain the fairground during the off-season. The FDNY and NYPD watched over the fairground, and many exhibitors also hired their own security guards. Because of lower-than-expected attendance, the WFC agreed to reduce adult admission prices to 50 cents. The WFC agreed to redesign the Amusement Area to emphasize the rides there. The corporation also tried to attract visitors within an overnight drive from New York City, rather than guests from further afield.

At the requests of several U.S. state exhibitors, the WFC halved rent rates for U.S. state pavilions during the second season. Despite the uncertainty caused by the ongoing war, many European countries expressed interest in returning. In January 1940, Finland became the first country to agree to reopen its pavilion, while West Virginia was the first U.S. state to lease additional space. More than thirty nations had agreed to return by the end of the next month, though 11 nations and nine U.S. states withdrew. Most commercial exhibitors agreed to reopen their exhibits. Almost all major exhibitors with their own pavilions renewed their leases for the 1940 season, while most of the exhibitors who had withdrawn were more likely to be renting space from the WFC.

The fair was rebranded as the &quot;World&#x27;s Fair 1940 in New York&quot; for its second season. The WFC decided to focus more heavily on amusement attractions, and it added theaters and free shows. The Amusement Area was reduced in size and rebranded as the &quot;Great White Way&quot;, a reference to Broadway theatre. The transportation zone was renovated for more than $2 million. Several exhibits were added or expanded, and some pavilions were repaired. Low-cost eateries were also added. The fair&#x27;s construction superintendent estimated that the upgrades would cost $8 million. The WFC began selling one million souvenir ticket books on April 11, 1940, and the next week, it began selling discounted tickets to students across the U.S. By the end of April, all of the attractions in the Amusement Area had been leased, and half a million advance tickets had been sold or ordered.

=== 1940 season ===
Originally, the second season was supposed to open on May 25, 1940, but following requests from organizations, the WFC agreed to open the fair two weeks earlier. The fair&#x27;s police force was downsized due to low crime rates, and the overall number of staff was reduced to 5,500. According to Gibson, at least 40 million visitors needed to attend during 1940 for the WFC to break even. In contrast to the more formal atmosphere that had characterized the first season, the second season had a more informal, &quot;folksy&quot; atmosphere. Additionally, the international area included exhibits from 43 countries, plus the Pan-American Union and League of Nations. Adults paid 50 cents, while children paid 25 cents; children&#x27;s admission was reduced to 10 cents on &quot;Children&#x27;s Days&quot;. To entice people to attend the fair, several local business groups and hotels randomly gave 170 automobiles to visitors. The World&#x27;s Fair reopened on May 11 and recorded 191,196 visitors on that day. Early in the 1940 season, the WFC sold off most of its outstanding debt from the previous season. 

By the end of June, revenue was lagging projections, so the WFC dismissed 500 employees. Due to an increase in federal tax rates, amusement concessionaires increased ticket prices. The fair&#x27;s restaurateurs elected to pay the extra taxes rather than raise food prices. On July 4, 1940, two NYPD officers investigating a time bomb at the British Pavilion died when the bomb detonated. Later the same month, the WFC began surveying the fair&#x27;s buildings, with plans to demolish them. In large part due to inclement weather, some concessionaires considered closing their attractions that August. Attendance lagged by nearly 3 million compared with the previous season. Bondholders agreed to waive $14.5 million of the WFC&#x27;s debt. The WFC also began selling off materials and memorabilia from the fair. Daily attendance increased gradually, reaching 10 million visitors by the end of August; by then, Gibson said the fair had made over $2.5 million. The WFC had drawn up detailed plans for clearing the site by the beginning of October, and the corporation&#x27;s executive leadership oversaw the site-clearing process.

To promote the fair, hundreds of American newspapers printed discounted tickets; the promotion attracted nearly 350,000 visitors on a single day. The city government also provided free tickets to adults who were receiving welfare payments through the Home Relief program. By the middle of that month, the fair&#x27;s second season had recorded a $4.15 million net profit. In the fair&#x27;s last week, the WFC hosted extravagant shows such as fireworks displays. The fair had 537,952 visitors on its final day, October 27, 1940. The day afterward, passersby were allowed to tour the grounds for $2. In total, the fair had recorded 19,115,713 million visitors during 1940, and attendance had exceeded 100,000 on only 59 days. The fair had attracted just over 45 million visitors across both seasons. The 1940 season also recorded little crime, with 96 arrests; the July 4 bombing had been the only violent crime.

==Fairground==

The fairground was divided into seven geographic or thematic zones, five of which had &quot;focal exhibits&quot;, and there were two focal exhibits housed in their own buildings. The plan called for wide tree-lined pathways converging on the Trylon and Perisphere, the fair&#x27;s symbol and primary theme center. The Trylon and Perisphere were the only structures on the fairground that were painted completely white; the buildings in the surrounding zones were color-coded. The fairground had of sidewalks and of roads, in addition to dozens of miles of sewers, water mains, gas mains, and electrical ducts. About 850 phone booths were scattered across the fairground. There were 11 entrances to the grounds during the 1939 season, and 13 entrances during the 1940 season.

=== Landscape features ===
From the start, Moses wanted to convert the site into a park after the fair, and the fairground&#x27;s landscape architect, Gilmore David Clarke, had designed the fairground with this expectation in mind. The central portion of the old ash dumps became the main fairground, while the southern section of the dumps became the Amusement Area. The fairground used up to of topsoil, as well as salty, acidic soil dredged from the bottoms of the lagoons. The fairground included of lawns and a wide range of topiary and deciduous trees. Around 10,000 trees were transplanted to the fairground, of which more than 97 percent survived the 1939 season. There were no evergreen trees because it was not open during the winter, and the site also did not have rare plants.

The fairground contained one million plants, one million bulbs, 250,000 shrubs, and 10,000 trees. The site had 7,000 American camassias, 48,000 scillas, and 50,000 narcissi, and there were several formal gardens as well, with roses, yew, and other plants. In addition, the Netherlands donated one million tulip bulbs; as part of an agreement with the Dutch government, the tulips were destroyed and replaced with summertime plantings the month after the 1939 season opened. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; estimated that the WFC spent some on plants at the fair. There were also around 50 landscaped gardens. Some of these fountains included water features such as fountains, pools, and brooks. For the 1940 season, annuals and trees were added instead of the tulips, and a woodland garden was added.

Despite the fair&#x27;s futuristic theme, the fairground&#x27;s layout—with streets radiating from the theme center—was heavily inspired by classical architecture. Some streets were named after notable Manhattan thoroughfares or American historical figures, while others were named based on their function. A central esplanade called Constitution Mall was planned as part of the fairground, running between the Grand Central Parkway to the west and Lawrence Street to the east. A curving road named Rainbow Avenue connected the color-coded zones. At the eastern end of the mall was the Central Mall Lagoon, an elliptical lake with fountains. In the southern half of the fairground, the Flushing River was dredged to create Meadow and Willow lakes. Several of the fair&#x27;s fountains had illuminated water jets with gas burners. Nightly light shows, with music, took place at the Lagoon of Nations as well.

===Pavilions and attractions===

Pavilions and attractions generally fell into one of three categories: exhibits sponsored by either the WFC or private companies, government exhibits, and amusement attractions. The WFC subleased the land to exhibitors, charging different rates based on the sites&#x27; proximity to major paths. There were 1,500 exhibitors on the fair&#x27;s opening day, representing about 40 industries. 

The fair had about 375 buildings, of which 100 were developed by the WFC. The commission reserved about for its own structures. The buildings included design features such as domes, spirals, buttresses, porticos, rotundas, tall pylons, and corkscrew-shaped ramps. Many buildings&#x27; steel frames were bolted together so they could be easily disassembled. Most of the attractions were in the central exhibit area, covering . Because the fairground was built atop swampy land, many of the largest buildings were placed on steel-and-concrete decks, pilings, or caissons. The pavilions were mostly illuminated by artificial light fixtures, including fluorescent lighting tubes, mercury lamps, and fluorescent pylons. The fairground also had a marina, as well as hundreds of fountains, toilets, and benches.

==== Zones ====
The Trylon and Perisphere theme center, designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, consisted of a tower and a sphere. North of the theme center was the Communications and Business Systems Zone. The Community Interest Zone, immediately to the east, showcased several trades or industries that were popular among the public at the time. The Government Zone occupied the east end of the fair; it contained a centrally located Court of Peace, a Lagoon of Nations, and a smaller Court of States. Southwest of the Government Zone was the Food Zone, composed of 13 buildings related to that industry. 

The Production and Distribution Zone was dedicated to showcasing industries that specialized in manufacturing and distribution. The Transportation Zone was located west of the Theme Center, across the Grand Central Parkway, connected to the rest of the fairground by two crossings. The Transportation Zone included large exhibits for the motor-vehicle aviation, railroad, and maritime industries. The Amusement Area was located south of the World&#x27;s Fair Boulevard, on a horseshoe-shaped site surrounding Meadow Lake, and it was divided into more than a dozen themed zones. The Amusement Area contained numerous bars, restaurants, miniature villages, musical programs, dance floors, rides, and arcade attractions.

==== Standalone exhibits and structures ====
Two focal exhibits were not located within any zone. The first was the Medical and Public Health Building on Constitution Mall and the Avenue of Patriots (immediately northeast of the Theme Center), which contained several halls dedicated to health. The other was the Science and Education Building, just north of the Medical and Public Health Building. The administration building was at the western end of the fairground, and there was also a Manufacturers Trust bank branch.

=== Transportation ===
Several public transit lines were built or upgraded to serve the fair. The Independent Subway System&#x27;s (IND) World&#x27;s Fair Line, specially built for the exposition, was dismantled after the fair ended. The Willets Point station on the Flushing Line was rebuilt to handle fair traffic on the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit (BMT) systems. A special fleet of 50 World&#x27;s Fair Lo-V subway cars were built, and the existing Q-type Queens subway cars were rebuilt to provide additional service on the Flushing Line. A Long Island Rail Road station (now Mets–Willets Point) was built next to the Flushing Line station. In addition, Queens-Nassau Transit Lines bought 55 buses to serve passengers heading to the fairground, and a water taxi service traveled to the fair from City Island, Bronx.

There were also several modes of transit traveling around the fairground itself. General Motors manufactured 100 buses specifically for the fair; Exposition Greyhound Lines operated the buses, which connected with each of the fairground&#x27;s entrances and operated along seven routes. There were also tractor trains that traveled along the fairground&#x27;s paths, as well as tour buses that gave one-hour-long tours of the fair. In addition, visitors could rent one of 500 rolling chairs, each of which had space for one or two people. Boats also traveled around Fountain Lake (now Meadow Lake), stopping at seven piers. For a fee, visitors could ride a 40-passenger motorboat across Meadow Lake to the Florida pavilion.

Several highways and roads were widened or extended in advance of the World&#x27;s Fair. Markers were placed throughout the city to direct motorists to the fairground, and several highways were outfitted with amber lights. Maps also touted the fairground&#x27;s proximity to five airports and seaplane bases. During the fair, the Civil Aeronautics Authority temporarily banned most planes from flying over the fairground, except for planes taking off or arriving at the nearby airports.

== Culture ==

=== Themes and icons ===
The fair was themed to &quot;the world of tomorrow&quot;. The colors blue and orange, the official colors of New York City, were chosen as the official colors of the fair. The fair&#x27;s official seal depicted the Statue of Liberty with her torch, which was available in multiple color schemes. The fair&#x27;s official flag was originally a triband with a blue bar flanked by orange bars; there was a white seal in the center of the blue bar.

Another theme of the fair was the emerging new middle class. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation produced the film &quot;The Middleton Family at the New York World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, which depicted a fictional Midwestern family, the Middletons, taking in the fair. The Perisphere&#x27;s Democracity exhibition envisioned middle-class &quot;Pleasantvilles&quot; arranged around a central hub.

=== Arts ===

==== Music ====
The WFC established a music advisory committee for the fair in 1937, which was led by the conductor Allen Wardwell. The music advisory committee proposed hosting a festival at the fairground and other places in New York City. About 500 groups signed up to perform at the fair, and music festivals also took place at Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House in Manhattan. &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Olin Downes was the fair&#x27;s music director; he selected Hugh Ross to organize recitals and concerts at the Temple of Religion. Eugene La Barre led the World&#x27;s Fair band, which was composed of 56 musicians, and the WFC held a competition to select three songs for the band to perform. Unlike in the 1939 season, the fair had no organized music program during 1940. Instead, the fair&#x27;s orchestra played songs on request during 1940; on an average day, they received more than 1,200 requests and played over 200 songs.

Several theme songs were written for the fair, none of which caught on. William Grant Still recorded the song &quot;Rising Tide&quot;, a three-minute tune that was played continuously during the 1939 season. &quot;Dawn of a New Day&quot;, one of George Gershwin&#x27;s final songs, was also recorded for the fair. La Barre&#x27;s &quot;For Peace and Freedom&quot; was selected as the 1940 season&#x27;s theme song.

==== Films and stage shows ====
The fair hosted eight musical shows during the 1939 season and seven musicals during 1940. For instance, Billy Rose staged his Aquacade musical, and the fair had a musical pageant called the American Jubilee. Exhibitors screened 612 films during the first season. The fair had 34 auditoriums during the 1939 season, which were operated by the governments of 19 nations, industrial exhibitors, and city-government agencies. During the 1940 season, the fairground had 30 cinemas with an estimated 6,200 seats. The fair showcased not only feature films but also non-theatrical motion pictures, including both silent films and sound films. These motion pictures were all shot on 16 mm and 35 mm film.

==== Visual art and sculpture ====

From the outset, the fairground was planned to include decorations, particularly large murals, sculptures, and reliefs. Initially, however, there were no plans to exhibit contemporary art at the fair. After observers criticized the fair&#x27;s lack of formal art galleries, Whalen agreed to include a community art center, and the WFC also held art competitions for muralists and sculptors. Eight hundred contemporary American artworks from the 48 states were exhibited at the fair during 1939, and a rotating display of American art was showcased in 1940. At the Masterpieces of Art building, there were hundreds of rare paintings. During the 1940 season, even more paintings were shown. The WFC bought some of the fair&#x27;s artwork and distributed it across the U.S. after the fair. In addition, foreign governments sponsored exhibits of sculptures and visual art in their respective pavilions.

Whalen, who was determined that the fair should &quot;not represent the work of any one person or school&quot;, employed 181 visual artists, designers, and architects. Many of the buildings&#x27; facades were decorated with murals, commissioned by both the WFC and individual exhibitors in about 100 colors. There were about 105 murals at the fair, which measured as large as . The murals were executed in a variety of materials, such as metal strips, mosaic tiles, and paint. The WFC&#x27;s board of design approved murals based on how well they harmonized with the surrounding buildings. Union members painted the actual murals. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the largest program of exterior mural painting ever undertaken&quot;, while the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; said that &quot;never before has mural decoration been attempted on so large or lively a scale&quot;. Works Progress Administration artists painted murals for the fair as well. Ernest Peixotto oversaw the development of the murals and the fair&#x27;s color-coding system.

The fair also included 174 sculptures. The largest statue at the fair was James Earle Fraser&#x27;s sculpture of George Washington, which stood in the middle of the fair&#x27;s Constitution Mall. The &quot;Times&quot; credited Lee Lawrie—who oversaw the installation of the fair&#x27;s artwork—with describing the sculptures as &quot;an essential part of the fair&quot;. Three of the sculptures were intended to be preserved after the fair: Robert Foster&#x27;s &quot;Textile&quot;, Lawrence Tenney Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, and Waylande Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of the Atom&quot;. Various temporary sculptures, many of which were made of plaster, were placed on buildings.

=== Consumer products ===
The fair focused significantly on consumer products that happened to include scientific innovations, rather than presenting scientific innovations in their own right. Products shown at the fair included RCA televisions, a Crosley vehicle from 1940, and a Novachord organ manufactured by The Hammond Organ Company. There were also exhibits of nylon, cellophane, and Lucite. Other objects included Vermeer&#x27;s painting &quot;The Milkmaid&quot;, a pencil sharpener, the White Manna diner, General Motors&#x27; model city Futurama, and the Nimatron computer game. In addition, older objects were displayed at the fair, such as a model of the world&#x27;s first bicycle.

Electronics were showcased at the fair. The IBM exhibit displayed the Radiotype writing machine, and RCA displayed various types of machinery in a &quot;television laboratory&quot;. RCA and NBC agreed to host television demonstrations at the World&#x27;s Fair. These TVs displayed several programs, including the first televised Major League Baseball game; a program from WRGB-TV in Schenectady, New York; and performances of the play &quot;When We Are Married&quot;. Westinghouse&#x27;s exhibit featured Elektro the Moto-Man, a robot that talked, differentiated colors, and smoked cigarettes. Bell Labs&#x27; Voder, a keyboard-operated speech synthesizer, was demonstrated at the fair. Other futuristic exhibits included General Electric&#x27;s home of tomorrow, as well as the 15 homes in the Tomorrow Town exhibit.

=== Food ===
The fair had at least 40 restaurants with a combined 23,000 seats, in addition to 261 refreshment stands, during the 1939 season. Cuisine from 24 participating countries was served at the fair. These included caviar in the Romanian and Polish pavilions; borscht, blini, and pelmeni from the Soviet pavilion; soufflés from the French pavilion; smorgasbords from the Swedish pavilion; and kebabs and honey desserts from the Albanian pavilion. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 1964 characterized bicarbonate of soda as the 1939 fair&#x27;s most popular soda. The WFC also awarded quick-service food concessions to companies such as Childs Restaurants, Longchamps, and the Brass Rail. The concessions included 80 hot-dog stands, in addition to 59 soda stalls, 38 root beer stands, and 25 popcorn stands.

The city government also appointed 36 inspectors to enforce food safety at the fair. During the fair&#x27;s first season, there were complaints that the food was too expensive; one &quot;New York Times&quot; report found that restaurants were charging as much as for &quot;à la carte&quot; meals. For the 1940 season, there were 70 restaurants and between 150 and 235 concession stands. The WFC introduced regulations during the second season, restricting restaurateurs from drastically increasing food prices. Throughout both seasons, the fair sold an estimated 16.2 million hot dogs, 8.3 million burgers, 5.1 million doughnuts, and 2.7 million cups of beer.

=== Other events ===
Participating countries, U.S. states and territories, New York counties, businesses, and organizations were given special theme days at the fair, during which celebrations were held. A different button was issued for each theme day. During the fair, there were fireworks displays on the lagoon, as well as colorful searchlights illuminating Meadow Lake.

The fair coincided with the 1st World Science Fiction Convention, which took place at the Caravan Hall in Manhattan on July 2–4, 1939. In addition, on July 3, 1940, the fair hosted &quot;Superman Day&quot;, which included an athletic contest and an appearance by an actor portraying Superman. Sporting events throughout the New York City area were also planned in conjunction with the World&#x27;s Fair, and the WFC sponsored a sports camp for boys during both seasons.

==Aftermath==
===Site and structures===
Demolition began the day after the fair ended. Almost all structures had to be removed within 120 days of the fair&#x27;s closure, and the vast majority of structures were dismantled or moved shortly after the fair&#x27;s final day. Valuable exhibits, artwork, and historic artifacts were relocated. Within a month of the fair&#x27;s closure, many of the structures had been demolished and workers were restoring the landscape. Cables and other materials were removed and sold for scrap, and there were proposals to melt down the buildings&#x27; structural steel into scrap metal for the U.S. war effort. During the fair&#x27;s demolition, five men were killed when one of the buildings&#x27; ceilings collapsed.

Despite a citywide moratorium on new construction, La Guardia provided funding to convert the fairground into parkland, although only $750,000 was provided for this purpose. Work on the park began in December 1940, and Flushing Meadows Park opened the next year. The site hosted the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair before it again became a park in 1967. The NYPD&#x27;s Flushing Meadows precinct was disbanded in 1952, but the Queens traffic division (which had been established to manage traffic during the fair) continued until 1972.

Seven structures were preserved as part of the park. By the 1960s, only two of the fair&#x27;s original structures remained, the New York City Pavilion and the Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade amphitheater, though the Aquacade was torn down in the 1990s. The fair&#x27;s esplanade, five bridges, and the World&#x27;s Fair Marina were preserved as well, but the fountains were demolished. Many amusement rides were sold to Luna Park at Coney Island; the Parachute Jump was sold and relocated to Steeplechase Park, also in Coney Island. Other buildings that were relocated included a structure from the fair&#x27;s Town of Tomorrow exhibit, as well as the Belgian Building. Some of the buildings&#x27; glass bricks were salvaged and used elsewhere. Furniture, equipment, and decorations were sold off. 

===Foreign exhibits and staff===
Initially, the U.S. government had not imposed customs duties on foreign exhibits because it anticipated that the exhibits would be repatriated after the fair. Customs duties were imposed on exhibits that remained in the U.S. after the fair. Afterward, the exhibits could be sent back to their home country, retained in the U.S., destroyed, or sold. However, many nations could not send their exhibits back home due to World War II, and President Roosevelt had temporarily frozen the assets of seven foreign exhibitors whose countries had been invaded. Many European pavilions&#x27; staff were also unable to return home due to the war; &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that 350 foreign staffers could not easily return home, while the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; put the number of affected employees at 400. In response, U.S. representative John J. Delaney introduced legislation in October 1940 to allow these workers to remain in the U.S.

Several countries in German-occupied Europe donated or lent their World&#x27;s Fair exhibits to institutions across the United States. Most of the Polish pavilion&#x27;s items were sold by the Polish government-in-exile to the Polish Museum of America, except for the monument of the Polish–Lithuanian King Jagiełło. which was reinstalled in Central Park. The British pavilion&#x27;s copy of the Magna Carta remained in the U.S., and a panel from that pavilion depicting George Washington&#x27;s lineage was sent to the Library of Congress. In addition, some French artwork displayed at the fair was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, and other artwork from that pavilion was displayed at the Riverside Museum. Three French restaurants from the fair—La Caravelle, Le Pavillon, and La Côte Basque—reopened in Manhattan. Objects from the Swedish, Turkish, and Canadian pavilions were also retained in New York City.

The WFC also had to dispose of Axis countries&#x27; exhibits. The U.S. government seized the Italian State Railways&#x27; train display and melted it down for scrap, while it sold off binoculars from the Czechoslovak pavilion and wine from the Rumania pavilion to pay customs duties. There were several unsuccessful attempts to give away the Italian pavilion&#x27;s Guglielmo Marconi monument, and the Hungarian pavilion&#x27;s statue of Saint Istvan was not given away until 1956.

=== Profitability and dissolution of WFC ===
When the fair closed, the WFC initially predicted that the fair would recoup 38.4% of its cost, later revised to 39.2%. The WFC ultimately recovered only 32% of its original expenditure. Despite the fair&#x27;s overall unprofitability, the Amusement Area recorded a net profit. In total, the WFC earned $3.9 million during the 1939 season and $3.4 million during the 1940 season. The WFC paid bondholders $2.08 million in early 1941 and made their final payments to bondholders in June 1942. For several years, the WFC retained a small staff to close out its financial accounts. The corporation was not formally dissolved until August 1944; at the time of its dissolution, the WFC owed shareholders $19 million.

==Impact==

=== Reception ===

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 1936, as the fair was still being developed, that the fair would give New York City a permanent public park, while &quot;visitors will get an eyeful beyond their fondest imagination and the hotel-keepers will get a pocketful&quot; of money. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the event would &quot;still be a great fair&quot;, even if half the buildings were never built. Another newspaper wrote that the fair, along with the Golden Gate Exposition, would be &quot;two stunning examples of science in action&quot;. Just before the fair opened, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; wrote that, despite the ongoing Nazi conquest of Europe, workers at the 1939 fair &quot;still [believed] the world of to-day has possibilities of progress&quot;.

Upon the fair&#x27;s opening, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer praised the fairground&#x27;s futuristic architecture and landscaping, even while stating that &quot;there is also architecture on which the classicist can rest his peepers&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that European countries regarded the fair as an opportunity to display &quot;its particular political views before the American public under the guise of good-will and commercial display&quot;. In an August 1939 Gallup poll of the fair&#x27;s visitors, 84% of respondents said they wanted to return, while only 3% disliked the fair.

When the fair closed, the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote in 1940 that &quot;the World&#x27;s Fair was devoted to the arts of peace, and this is time of war&quot;. A decade after the fair, one writer for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; said the expo had &quot;become for many of us a symbol of the past&quot;, in large part because of the war that followed. In 1964, one &quot;New York Times&quot; writer said the 1939 fair had been envisioned in an era &quot;that had in its calendar no World War II, no Hiroshima, no Korea, no fires in Africa and Asia&quot;. The design critic Paul Goldberger, writing in 1980, described the fair as significant for its products and architecture, while a &quot;Newsday&quot; critic wrote that the fair had provided hope at a time when everyone was fearful of the war. Robert A. M. Stern wrote in his 1987 book &quot;New York 1930&quot; that &quot;the fair was seen as little more than a transitory good-time place&quot;.

===Economic and regional influence===
To limit excessive real-estate development around the fairground, city officials requested in early 1936 that the neighborhoods around Flushing Meadows be rezoned as residential areas. The city approved restrictions in 1937, preventing the construction of high-rise buildings around the site and regulating businesses from operating within of the fairground. One &quot;New York Times&quot; writer wrote in 1938 that, although residential development in Queens was increasing, this was due to the presence of new transport links, rather than because of the fair. After the fair began, commercial activity around Flushing, Queens, also increased, and real-estate prices there increased several times over.

Grover Whalen predicted that the fair would attract 50 million visitors, who would spend $1 billion in total. Numerous retailers on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan renovated their buildings for the fair, and room rates at local hotels were also increased. By May 1939, real-estate figures predicted that the fair would earn between $1 billion and $1.5 billion for the city&#x27;s economy. The state legislature predicted that the fair would spur business throughout New York state, and Whalen predicted that the fair would increase total spending across the U.S. by $10 billion. During the fair, the New York state government sought to attract visitors to other parts of the state, such as the Finger Lakes, Adirondack Mountains, and Catskill Mountains.

During the 1939 season, New York City saw both increased vehicular traffic and public-transit use, even though the city actually had fewer commuters (continuing a decade-long trend). Vehicular traffic in Manhattan south of 61st Street increased during the fair, as did hotel-room bookings in the city. The exposition also spurred increased spending in New York City and was indirectly connected with Queens&#x27; further development. Although most tourists to New York City in 1939 came specifically for the fair, the rest of the city also saw increased tourism in 1940.

===Media and archives===
After the fair, documents and films from the event were sent to the New York Public Library. The National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., described the 1939 fair in its 2010–2011 exhibition &quot;Designing Tomorrow: America&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fairs of the 1930s&quot;, while the Queens Museum hosted a retrospective exhibit about the fair in 1980. Private collectors have amassed a large amount of memorabilia from the fair. These ephemera include print media such as guidebooks, posters, and programs, in addition to everyday objects such as pens, ashtrays, maps, and puzzles.

The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair has been dramatized in books such as David Gelernter&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;1939-The Lost World of the Fair&quot;. There have also been several nonfiction books about the fair, including Barbara Cohen, Steven Heller, and Seymour Chwast&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;Trylon and Perisphere&quot; and James Mauro&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;Twilight at the World of Tomorrow&quot;. In addition, objects and footage from the event are shown in the 1984 documentary &quot;The World of Tomorrow&quot;.

<text>Eights Week, also known as Summer Eights, is a four-day regatta of bumps races which constitutes the University of Oxford&#x27;s main intercollegiate rowing event of the year. The regatta takes place in May of each year, from the Wednesday to the Saturday of the fifth week of Trinity Term. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s eights compete in separate divisions for their colleges.

==Overview==


The racing takes place on the Isis, a length of the River Thames, which is generally too narrow for side by side racing. For each division, twelve boats line up at the downstream end of the stretch, each cox holding onto a rope attached to the bank, leaving around 1.5 boat lengths between each boat. The start of racing is signalled by the firing of a cannon, each crew attempting to progress up their division by bumping the boat in front, while avoiding being bumped by the boat behind. Once a bump has taken place, both of the crews involved stop racing and move to the side to allow the rest of the division to pass. It is possible to &quot;over bump&quot; if the 2 crews in front of your boat bump (and so drop out) and your boat can catch the boat that was in front of them. They then swap places for the next day&#x27;s racing, whether that be the calendar day or the first day of racing in the next year&#x27;s competition.

The ultimate aim of a crew is to become &quot;Head of the River&quot; (top of the first division) and stay there. This entitles the winning crew to commission trophy oars in their college colours with the names and weights of the successful crew on them—commonly called &quot;winning blades&quot;. As this is only possible for crews already near the top of division one, another way to win blades is to bump on each day of the competition.

The &quot;Double Headship&quot; is an accolade awarded to any college finishing with both their men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crews at the &quot;Head of the River&quot; in their respective divisions. This feat has only ever been achieved once, by Pembroke College in 2003. A silver &quot;Double Headship Trophy&quot; was commissioned from the silversmith Peter Musson in 2003, to commemorate the historic occasion.

==History ==

Although regular races between professional watermen had been known since 1715 when Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge was instituted, amateur racing was unknown before 1808. Meanwhile, recreational rowing had begun in Oxford very much earlier, with students rowing in single wherries at least as early as 1769.

The first amateur races between organised clubs which prepared and trained for the event began in Oxford in 1815. In this year, crews from Brasenose College and Jesus College raced for the Head of the River, from Iffley Lock to Mr King&#x27;s Barge, which was moored near the current Head of the River hotel. The event is also notable for the fact that both crews rowed in eight oared boats, specially built for the purpose. Such recreational as occurred at this time was usually conducted in pairs, or four or six oared cutters. The fact the racing was conducted in eight oared boats gave rise to the event being known as Eights.

Brasenose College and Jesus College recontested the event in 1816, with Brasenose again triumphing. Christ Church joined in the event from 1817, when they went Head, a position they retained until 1819. Christ Church did not row in 1820. The next recorded races, between Brasenose and Jesus, were in 1821 and 1822. A dispute about professional watermen being allowed in college crews precluded racing in 1823. Until this time, Jesus and Brasenose had each used paid coaches who rowed in the stroke seats of the crews.

From 1824, Christ Church and Exeter College began racing, with Exeter going Head in that year. A rule banning the use of &quot;out college men&quot; (i.e. men from other colleges) rowing in college crews saw the entry of Worcester College in 1825, University and Balliol Colleges in 1827, and Oriel and Trinity Colleges in 1828.

During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Summer Eights were cancelled for the first time since the Second World War. In the year after, Summer Eights were replaced by &quot;Summer Torpids&quot;, which was held instead because the 2021 Torpids races were also cancelled due to the pandemic response. Both Summer Eights and Torpids resumed as regular in 2022, using the college rankings from the end of 2019. In 2023, the Brasenose-Peter&#x27;s composite crew became the first composite crew to qualify in the history of Summer Eights as well as the first to ever get a bump.

== Head of the River – Men==
Summer Eights has been held since 1815.

No racing occurred during World War I. In World War II, though college rowing continued, there were insufficient students for normal racing between colleges to be maintained. As a consequence, most colleges competed in composite clubs, and the number of crews competing was greatly curtailed. After the war, normal racing continued, and in 1946 college crews started in the order in which they finished in 1939.

<doc id="219292" wikidata="Q113515838" url="?curid=219292" title="Affirmative defense">
<text>An affirmative defense to a civil lawsuit or criminal charge is a fact or set of facts other than those alleged by the plaintiff or prosecutor which, if proven by the defendant, defeats or mitigates the legal consequences of the defendant&#x27;s otherwise unlawful conduct. In civil lawsuits, affirmative defenses include the statute of limitations, the statute of frauds, waiver, and other affirmative defenses such as, in the United States, those listed in Rule 8 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In criminal prosecutions, examples of affirmative defenses are self defense, insanity, entrapment and the statute of limitations.

==Description==
In an affirmative defense, the defendant may concede that they committed the alleged acts, but they prove other facts which, under the law, either justify or excuse their otherwise wrongful actions, or otherwise overcomes the plaintiff&#x27;s claim. In criminal law, an affirmative defense is sometimes called a justification or excuse defense. Consequently, affirmative defenses limit or excuse a defendant&#x27;s criminal culpability or civil liability.

A clear illustration of an affirmative defense is self defense. In its simplest form, a criminal defendant may be exonerated if he can demonstrate that he had an &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot; belief that another&#x27;s use of force was unlawful and that the defendant&#x27;s conduct was necessary to protect himself.

Most affirmative defenses must be pleaded in a timely manner by a defendant in order for the court to consider them, or else they are considered waived by the defendant&#x27;s failure to assert them. The classic unwaivable affirmative defense is lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The issue of timely assertion is often the subject of contentious litigation.

=== The insanity plea ===
Among the most controversial affirmative defenses is the insanity defense, whereby a criminal defendant seeks to be excused from criminal liability on the ground that a mental illness, at the time of the alleged crime, prevented him or her from understanding the wrongful nature of his or her actions.

=== Burden of proof ===
Because an affirmative defense requires an assertion of facts beyond those claimed by the plaintiff, generally the party who offers an affirmative defense bears the burden of proof. The standard of proof is typically lower than beyond a reasonable doubt. It can either be proved by clear and convincing evidence or by a preponderance of the evidence.

In this respect, affirmative defenses differ from ordinary defenses [claim of right, alibi, infancy, necessity, and self-defense (which is an affirmative defense at common law)], which the prosecution has the burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt.

=== Governing rules ===
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs the assertion of affirmative defenses in civil cases that are filed in the United States district courts. Rule 8(c) specifically enumerates the following defenses: &quot;accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.&quot;

Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that affirmative defenses be based on &quot;knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,&quot; and cannot consist of a laundry list of all known affirmative defenses.

=== Affirmative vs. negating defense ===
An affirmative defense is different from a &quot;negating defense&quot;. A negating defense is one which tends to disprove an element of the plaintiff&#x27;s or prosecutor&#x27;s case. An example might be a mistake of fact claim in a prosecution for intentional drug possession, where the defendant asserts that he or she mistakenly believed that the object possessed was an innocent substance. Because this defense simply shows that an element of the offense (knowledge of the nature of the substance) is not present, the defendant does not have any burden of persuasion with regard to a negating defense. At most the defendant has the burden of producing sufficient evidence to raise the issue.

===Fair use===
In &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot;, the United States Supreme Court held that fair use was an affirmative defense to copyright infringement. This means that in litigation on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the burden of raising and proving that the use was fair and not an infringement.

However, fair use is not always an affirmative defense; the burden of persuasion may instead fall to the copyright owner in Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) infringement actions. In a case challenging a takedown notice issued under the DMCA, the Ninth Circuit held in &quot;Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.&quot; that the submitter of a DMCA takedown request (who would then be the plaintiff in any subsequent litigation) has the burden to consider fair use prior to submitting the takedown request. &quot;Even if, as Universal urges, fair use is classified as an &#x27;affirmative defense,&#x27; we hold—for the purposes of the DMCA—fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses. We conclude that because 17 U.S.C. § 107 created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is &quot;authorized by the law&quot; and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c).&quot;

==Examples==
* Civil law
** accord and satisfaction
** assumption of risk (when the plaintiff knowingly entered into a dangerous situation)
** authority
** consent
** defense of property
** estoppel
** contract specification
** contractual provision (when the defendant&#x27;s liability for causing the plaintiff&#x27;s injuries had been waived in the contract; however, these provisions are typically unconscionable in many situations.)
** contributory negligence (when the plaintiff&#x27;s actions contributed to his own injury)
** fair use
** laches (similar to statute of limitation)
** legal release
** repossession
** statute of frauds
** statute of limitations (too much time has elapsed between the tort and the complaint)
** waiver
* Criminal law
** insanity defense
** necessity
** duress
** self defense
** truth
** public interest

<text>Alan Louis Charles Bullock, Baron Bullock, (13 December 1914 – 2 February 2004) was a British historian. He is best known for his book &quot;&quot; (1952), the first comprehensive biography of Adolf Hitler, which influenced many other Hitler biographies.

==Early life and career==
Bullock was born in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, the only child of Edith (née Brand) and Reverend Frank Allen Bullock, the latter a gardener turned Unitarian preacher. Alan was educated at Bradford Grammar School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied classics and modern history. After graduating in 1938, he worked as a research assistant for Winston Churchill, who was then writing his &quot;History of the English-Speaking Peoples.&quot; Bullock was a Harmsworth Senior Scholar at Merton College, Oxford, from 1938 to 1940. During World War II, he worked for the European Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). After the war, he returned to Oxford as a history fellow at New College.

Bullock was the censor of St Catherine&#x27;s Society (1952–1962) and then founding master of St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford (1962–1981), a college for undergraduates and graduates, divided between students of the sciences and the arts. He was credited with massive fundraising efforts to develop the college. Later, he was the first full-time Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University (1969–1973).

Bullock served as chairman of the National Advisory Committee on the Training and Supply of Teachers (1963–1965), the Schools&#x27; Council (1966–1969), the Committee of Inquiry into Reading and the Use of English (1972–1974), and the Committee of Inquiry on Industrial Democracy (1976–1977).

Bullock became widely known to the general public when he appeared on the informational BBC radio program &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;.

== &quot;Hitler: A Study in Tyranny&quot; ==
In 1952, Bullock published &quot;&quot;, the first comprehensive biography of Adolf Hitler, which used the recently available transcripts of the Nuremberg Trials, traditional resources, like letters, diaries, speeches and memoirs. The biography dominated Hitler scholarship for many years and portrayed the German dictator as an opportunistic (power politician). In Bullock&#x27;s opinion, Hitler was a &quot;mountebank&quot; and adventurer, devoid of scruples or beliefs, whose actions throughout his career were motivated only by a lust for power. Early in the book, Bullock writes the following about Hitler&#x27;s formative pre-First World War years in Vienna when he was alone and struggling

Bullock&#x27;s interpretation of Hitler led to a debate in the 1950s with Hugh Trevor-Roper, who argued that Hitler did possess beliefs, albeit repulsive ones and that his actions were motivated by them. Bullock was somewhat swayed by this debate and partially modified his assessment of Hitler. In his later writings, such as &quot;Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives&quot; (1991), Bullock depicted the dictator as more of an ideologue who had pursued the ideas expressed in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and elsewhere despite their consequences.

His work on the Hitler biography prompted Bullock to examine the role of the individual in history. Taking note of the shift in interest among professional historians towards social history, he agreed that deep long-term social forces are generally the decisive historical factor. He believed there are times in which the &quot;Great Man&quot; is decisive. He wrote that during revolutionary circumstances, &quot;It is possible for an individual to exert a powerful even a decisive influence on the way events develop and the policies that are followed&quot;.

&quot;Hitler: A Study in Tyranny&quot; has remained an important and relevant work. In 1991, John Campbell said of it: &quot;Although written so soon after the end of the war and despite a steady flow of fresh evidence and reinterpretation, it has not been surpassed in nearly 40 years: an astonishing achievement&quot;. In the obituary for Bullock in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Rebecca Smithers stated that &quot;Bullock&#x27;s famous maxim &#x27;Hitler was jobbed into power by backstairs intrigue&#x27; has stood the test of time&quot;.

== Other works ==
Bullock&#x27;s other works included &quot;The Liberal Tradition: From Fox to Keynes&quot; (1956) (co-edited with Maurice Shock), &quot;The Forming of the Nation&quot; (1969); &quot;Is History Becoming a Social Science? The Case of Contemporary History&quot; (1977); &quot;Has History a Future?&quot; (1977); &quot;The Humanist Tradition in the West&quot; (1985); &quot;Meeting Teachers&#x27; Management Needs&quot; (1988); &quot;Great Lives of the Twentieth Century&quot; (1989); and &quot;The Life and Times of Ernest Bevin&quot; (1960). The last was a three-volume biography of British Labour Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin. Bullock was also co-editor (along with Oliver Stallybrass) of &quot;The Harper Dictionary of Modern Thought&quot; (1977), a project that Bullock suggested to his Harper &amp; Row publisher when he found he could not define the word &quot;hermeneutics&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Bullock used his committee skills to produce a report which proved influential in the classroom, &quot;A Language for Life&quot; (1975). It offered recommendations for improving English teaching in the UK. Bullock later chaired the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy commissioned in December 1975 by the second Labour government of Harold Wilson. The committee&#x27;s report, which was also known as the Bullock Report, published in 1977, recommended workers&#x27; control in large companies with employees having a right to hold representative worker directorships.

Bullock occasionally appeared on television as a political pundit, for example, during the BBC coverage of the 1959 British general election.

== &quot;Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives&quot; ==
Late in his life, Bullock published &quot;Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives&quot; (1991)a massive and consequential book which he characterized in the Introduction as &quot;essentially a political biography, set against the background of the times in which they lived.&quot; He showed how the careers of Hitler and Joseph Stalin fed off each other to some extent. Bullock argued that Stalin&#x27;s ability to consolidate power in his home country and to not (unlike Hitler) over-extend himself, enabled him to retain power longer than Hitler. Bullock&#x27;s book was awarded the 1992 Wolfson History Prize.

Ronald Spector, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised Bullock for describing the development of Nazism and Soviet Communism without relying on abstract generalization or irrelevant detail: &quot;The writing is invariably interesting and informed and there are new insights and cogent analysis in every chapter.&quot; Amikam Nachmani noted how Hitler and Stalin &quot;come out as two blood-thirsty, pathologically evil, sanguine tyrants, who are sure of the presence of determinism, hence having unshakeable beliefs that Destiny assigned on them historical missions—the one to pursue a social industrialized revolution in the Soviet Union, the other to turn Germany into a global empire.&quot;

==Honours==
Bullock was decorated with the award of the Chevalier, Legion of Honour in 1970, and knighted in 1972, becoming Sir Alan Bullock and on 30 January 1976 he was created a life peer as Baron Bullock, &quot;of Leafield in the County of Oxfordshire&quot;. His writings always appeared under the name &quot;Alan Bullock&quot;.

In May 1976, Bullock was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the university.

== Death ==
Bullock died on 2 February 2004, in Oxford, England.

<doc id="219303" wikidata="Q52680" url="?curid=219303" title="Matthew Pinsent">
<text>Sir Matthew Clive Pinsent, (; born 10 October 1970) is an English rower and broadcaster. During his rowing career, he won 10 world championship gold medals and four consecutive Olympic gold medals.

Since retiring, he has worked as a sports broadcaster for the BBC.

==Early life and family==
Pinsent was born on 10 October 1970 in Holt, Norfolk. His father was the Rev. Ewen Macpherson Pinsent (1930–2020), curate of St Andrew&#x27;s parish church, Kelso, Scottish Borders, and his mother, Jean Grizel, came from a distinguished military family.

Through his own aristocratic and military family, Pinsent is directly descended from King Edward I and William the Conqueror.

==Rowing==

===Student rower===
Matthew Pinsent attended Aysgarth School in North Yorkshire before he began rowing at Eton College. He began his international career at the World Rowing Junior Championships in 1987. He raced again in 1988, winning the junior coxless pairs with Tim Foster.

After finishing school, Pinsent read geography at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford. While a student, he competed in three Boat Races, winning in 1990 and 1991 but was unsuccessful in 1993 (when he was Boat Club President), having taken a year out in 1992 in order to concentrate on preparing for the Barcelona Olympics.

===International career===
In 1990, while still at Oxford, he joined Steve Redgrave in the coxless pair at the World Rowing Championships, winning bronze. This was the beginning of a long partnership, and the pair won at the World Championships in 1991, and at the Olympic Games in 1992 and 1996.

In 2000 he won Olympic gold again as part of a coxless four with Redgrave, James Cracknell and Tim Foster. He also carried the flag for Team GB at the opening ceremony. In August 2000, the month prior to winning gold in Sydney, he took part in a three-part BBC documentary entitled &quot;Gold Fever&quot;. This followed the coxless four team in the years leading up to the Olympics, including video diaries recording the highs and lows in the quest for what would be Pinsent&#x27;s third consecutive gold.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in November 2000 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during a party celebrating the achievements of the British Olympic Association at the London Aquarium.

Pinsent and Cracknell then formed a men&#x27;s coxless pair and won the coxless and coxed pairs (with Neil Chugani coxing) in the 2001 World Championships, and the coxless pair in 2002. However, after a disappointing 2003 season that saw Pinsent&#x27;s first World Championships defeat since 1990, he and Cracknell moved to the men&#x27;s coxless four for 2004.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Pinsent&#x27;s fourth Olympic Games, Pinsent stroked the boat, with Cracknell, Ed Coode and Steve Williams. In a close race with world champions Canada, they again won gold.

Pinsent was elected to the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s Athletes&#x27; Commission in 2001, replacing Jan Železný. In 2004, at the Athens Olympics, Pinsent failed to secure re-election to the post, being replaced by Železný.

The , Pinsent had at one time the largest lung capacity recorded for a sportsman at 8.5 litres. This has since been surpassed by fellow rower Pete Reed who has been measured at 11.68 litres.

<text>Rafael Antonio Caldera Rodríguez ( ; 24 January 1916 – 24 December 2009) was a Venezuelan politician and academician who was the 46th and 51st president of Venezuela from 1969 to 1974 and again from 1994 to 1999, thus becoming the longest serving democratically elected politician to govern the country in the twentieth century. 
Widely acknowledged as one of the founders of Venezuela&#x27;s democratic system, one of the main architects of the 1961 Constitution, and a pioneer of the Christian Democratic movement in Latin America, Caldera was President during the second period of civilian democratic rule in a country beleaguered by a history of political violence and military caudillos.

His leadership helped to establish Venezuela&#x27;s reputation as one of the more stable democracies in Latin America during the second half of the twentieth century.

He is also remembered as the President who pardoned Hugo Chávez in December 1994, enabling him to gain freedom from prison and later on to run for the Presidency, which he achieved in 1998.

== Youth, education and early achievements ==


Rafael Caldera Rodríguez, the son of Rafael Caldera Izaguirre and Rosa Sofía Rodríguez Rivero, was born on 24 January 1916, in San Felipe, Venezuela. His mother having died when he was two and a half years-old, Caldera was raised by his maternal aunt María Eva Rodríguez Rivero and her husband Tomás Liscano Giménez.

Caldera attended elementary school in his native San Felipe and later in Caracas, at the Jesuit-run Catholic school San Ignacio de Loyola, where he completed his secondary education at the age of fifteen. The following year he began law studies at the Central University of Venezuela.

As a young university student, Caldera exhibited a precocious intellectual brilliance. At the age of nineteen, and after studying the 26 volumes of Andrés Bello&#x27;s collected works, Caldera published his first book, &quot;Andres Bello&quot;, a comprehensive analysis of the life and works of Bello&#x27;s literary, linguistic, legal, historic, philosophical, and political texts. This book received an award from the Venezuelan National Academy of Language in 1935, and has remained an indispensable reference for scholarship studies on the most prominent Venezuelan man-of-letters of the 19th century.

A year later, Venezuelan President López Contreras took notice of newspaper op-ed pieces about labor issues written by the young twenty-year-old Caldera. Contreras appointed him deputy director of the newly created National Labor Office. From this position, Caldera played a major role in the drafting of Venezuela&#x27;s first Labor Law, which remained current for more than fifty years until its reform in 1990. The international lawyer Wilfred Jenks, who drafted the Declaration of Philadelphia on labor rights and served two terms as Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO), an affiliated agency of the League of Nations, visited Venezuela in 1936 to review the law. He worked closely with Caldera, then Venezuela&#x27;s first ILO correspondent. Jenks later stated that the International Labor Code published under his guidance on the eve of the Second World War, contained several topics that were arranged in a manner that had originally been employed in the Venezuelan draft Labor Code.

During his university years, Caldera became actively engaged in student politics. He joined the Venezuelan Federation of Students (FEV), which was led by students who had revolted in 1928 against the dictator Juan Vicente Gómez and were known as the Generation of 28. Although significantly younger than his peers, Caldera courageously split from this student federation after its leadership called for anticlerical reforms demanding the expulsion of the Jesuits and other religious orders from Venezuela.

In 1936, Caldera founded the National Student Union (UNE), the seed of what eventually became the Venezuelan Christian Democratic movement.
== Political life ==
===The first thirty years (1939–1969)===

After graduating from university, Caldera founded National Action, a political movement formed to participate in municipal elections. Soon after, he founded the National Action Party and was elected in January 1941, at the age of twenty-five, to the Chamber of Deputies for his native state of Yaracuy.

As a congressman, he strongly opposed the bill that led to the 1941 boundary treaty with Colombia. He also had a prominent role in the debates on the partial reform of the 1936 Constitution and revisions to the Civil Code, and was a leading voice in the enactment of progressive labor laws. On 27 October 1945, Caldera was appointed Solicitor General by Rómulo Betancourt, head of the Revolutionary Government Junta that ousted President Isaías Medina Angarita on 18 October 1945.

On 13 January 1946, Caldera co-founded COPEI, &quot;Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente&quot; (Independent Political Electoral Organization Committee), the Christian Democratic Party that grew to become one of the two largest mass political parties in Venezuela. COPEI&#x27;s first statement of principles was inspired by the social teaching of the papal encyclical Quadragesimo Anno (1931) and embraced democracy, pluralism and social reform.

Four months later, on 13 April 1946, Caldera resigned from his position as Solicitor General in protest against the continuous violent attacks that members of his newly created party were suffering from government supporters.

In 1946, he was elected as a representative to the National Constituent Assembly, inaugurated on 17 December of that year. This legislative body had the task of drafting a new Constitution guided by the principles of the October Revolution. Venezuelans from every corner of the country came to admire the rhetorical skills of the young politician. Venezuelans were able to listen to Caldera&#x27;s speeches after Andrés Eloy Blanco, President of the National Constituent Assembly, granted Caldera&#x27;s request to allow live radio broadcast of the legislative sessions. Caldera played a prominent role in this assembly. He delivered celebrated speeches on the social rights of workers, the social function of private property, agrarian reform, religious freedom, religious education, and the need for direct, popular election of state governors.
In the 1947 elections, at the age of 31, he ran for president for the first time and travelled around the country to spread the ideas of his newly created party. The renowned Venezuelan novelist Rómulo Gallegos, candidate of the social democrat party AD (Democratic Action), won this election. Caldera also ran for Congress and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the period 1948–1953. His congressional term, however, was interrupted after Gallegos was ousted by a coup d&#x27;état on 24 November 1948.

In 1952, Caldera was elected representative to the National Constituent Assembly. After Colonel Marcos Pérez Jiménez, head of the Military Junta, ignored the electoral triumph of the URD party (Democratic Republican Union), and expelled Jóvito Villalba and other leaders of this party from the country, Caldera and other elected party members of COPEI refused to participate in the new Constituent Assembly.

During the Pérez Jiménez military dictatorship (1952–1958), Caldera was expelled from Universidad Central de Venezuela and arrested several times. On 3 August 1955, agents of the National Security, a large secret police force led by Pedro Estrada that hunted down opponents and ran notorious concentration camps, threw a bomb into Caldera&#x27;s home, endangering the life of his youngest child, then nine months-old. On 20 August 1957, he was once again imprisoned, but this time in solitary confinement, after Pérez Jiménez learned that Caldera, in all likelihood, would be the consensus candidate for all opposition parties in the presidential election scheduled for December, 1957. With Caldera imprisoned, Pérez Jiménez turned the election into an unconstitutional plebiscite (&quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; referendum) to decide his permanence in power.

Following the December 1957 plebiscite, Caldera was exiled by the Pérez Jiménez dictatorship in January 1958. He travelled to New York City and was greeted by Rómulo Betancourt and Jóvito Villalba. His exile, however, only lasted a few days since Marcos Pérez Jiménez was deposed by a civil revolt and military coup on 23 January 1958. Upon returning to Venezuela, the three leaders signed the Puntofijo Pact, named after Caldera&#x27;s residence where it was signed.

This pact contained important political agreements, especially, the commitment of all major political parties to build, protect and strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law. According to political science scholar Daniel H. Levine, its aim was to &quot;support democracy, band together to resist challenges to its legitimacy and survival; respect elections; and strive in general to institutionalize politics, channeling participation within democratic vehicles and arenas.&quot;
The Puntofijo Pact served as the foundation for the longest period of civil democratic rule in Venezuela (1958–1999).

Unable to reach agreement over a consensus candidate, the three major parties that signed the Puntofijo Pact (AD, URD, and COPEI) competed in the 1958 presidential election with their own candidates and platforms. Rafael Caldera lost to Rómulo Betancourt (AD) and Wolfgang Larrazábal (URD), who came in first and second place respectively. Caldera also ran for Congress and was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies. In this capacity, he co-presided the Bicameral Commission in charge of drafting the new Constitution.

The 1961 Constitution was Venezuela&#x27;s most successful and long-lived Constitution. This country adopted twenty-five different constitutions between 1811 and 1961, and only three of them (1830, 1854, 1881) lasted more than ten years. After its long history under dictatorships and arbitrary rule, Venezuela became, in the words of Professor Levine, &quot;the most stable mass democracy in South America&quot;. For four decades, he explains, &quot;Venezuelans built a political system marked by high participation, strong leadership, institutional continuity, and genuine pervasive competition. Power was transferred peacefully in six consecutive national elections.&quot;

Caldera came in second place in the 1963 presidential election that Raúl Leoni won as candidate of the ruling party (AD). Soon thereafter, he was elected President of the Christian Democratic Organization of America (ODCA) for the period 1964–1968, and as first President of the Christian Democratic World Union for the period 1967–1968.

In December 1968 Caldera ran for president for the third time. This time, Caldera benefited from a split in AD. Senate president Luis Beltrán Prieto Figueroa won the party primary. However, the party&#x27;s old guard felt Prieto was too left-wing, and intervened to deliver the nomination to Gonzalo Barrios. Prieto and a number of his supporters broke off to form the People&#x27;s Electoral Movement. Ultimately, Caldera defeated Barrios with 29.1 percent of the vote, a margin of just 32,000 votes. Prieto finished fourth, but his 719,000 votes far exceeded Caldera&#x27;s margin.

Caldera was sworn in on 11 March 1969. For the first time in Venezuela&#x27;s 139-year history as an independent nation, there was a peaceful and democratic transfer of power from the ruling party to the opposition. It was also the first time in the country&#x27;s history that a party won power without ever having resorted to violence. However, COPEI still had a minority in the legislature.

===First term in office (1969–1974)===


The process of pacification, a policy that allowed the armed left to lay down their arms and participate in politics under democratic rules, was one of the most important achievements of Caldera&#x27;s first presidency. This pardon effectively put an end to the guerrilla warfare which had plagued the country for ten years, costing many lives.

A key distinction between Caldera&#x27;s first government and those of his predecessors lay in the area of foreign policy. President Caldera restored bilateral relations with the Soviet Union and the socialist nations of Eastern Europe, as well as with a number of South American nations that had fallen under military dictatorships, including Argentina, Panama, and Peru. This policy, known as &quot;pluralistic solidarity&quot;, was a reversion of his predecessor&#x27;s Betancourt Doctrine.
Caldera took advantage of momentous developments in the international oil trade. He raised taxes on oil production, nationalized the gas industry, and enacted stringent laws regulating the U.S. oil companies that operated in Venezuela. In 1971, Caldera raised the oil profit tax to 70 per cent. In addition, he passed the hydrocarbons reversion law which provided that all oil company assets would go to the State once the concessions had elapsed.

This law paved the way for the nationalization of the oil industry, which was overseen by finance minister Luis Enrique Oberto. In his official visit to the U.S. in 1970, Caldera obtained a commitment from the Nixon administration to increase the market share of Venezuelan petroleum exports to the United States. Speaking before a joint session of the U.S. Congress, Caldera won repeated applause from the Senators and Representatives as he bluntly urged Americans to change their approach toward Latin America: &quot;The formula for achieving cordial relations,&quot; he said, &quot;cannot be the merciless attempts at forever lowering the prices of our goods while increasing the price of commodities we have to import.&quot;

Caldera&#x27;s most important domestic priorities during his first administration were education, housing, and infrastructure. He dramatically increased the number of educational institutions by doubling the number of public secondary schools and tripling the number of state university colleges and institutes of technology. Universities built and inaugurated during his administration include Simón Bolívar University, Simón Rodríguez, Táchira, and the Institute of Higher Studies for National Defense. On 3 October 1970, after weeks of violent student protests, and reports of weapons and explosive materials hidden inside the university campus, Caldera intervened Central University of Venezuela in order to protect and safeguard the life of students, professors and university employees. Once peace was restored on campus, the university regained its autonomy and held elections for a new governing board.

During Caldera&#x27;s first presidency, a total of 291,233 housing units were built. In terms of infrastructure and public buildings, some of the most important works completed during his first administration include: Poliedro de Caracas, the buildings for the Ministry of Education, the Courts of Law, and the Central Bank; the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, and the Ríos Reyna Theatre of the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, in Caracas; the general hospitals of Maracay, Coro, Mérida, San Carlos, Valle de la Pascua, Chiquinquirá in Maracaibo and Miguel Pérez Carreño and Los Magallanes de Catia in Caracas; major highways such as Cota Mil and La Araña-Caricuao in Caracas, Barquisimeto-Yaritagua, Valencia-Campo de Carabobo and Barcelona-Crucero de Maturín; airports La Chinita in Maracaibo, Santiago Mariño in Porlamar and Las Piedras in Paraguaná; the José Antonio Páez water dam in Mérida, Cumaripa in Yaracuy, and the third and four phases of the Guri Project in Guayana.

=== International leadership and years as Senator (1974–1993) ===
After leaving the presidency of Venezuela, Caldera continued both scholarly and political pursuits. He served in the Venezuelan Senate as all former presidents were granted lifelong appointments to the Senate under 1961 Constitution.

During this period Caldera was appointed to several important leadership positions in international organizations. Hailed for his role in maintaining democracy and stability in an era when most other Latin American countries experienced political upheaval, Caldera served as President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union from 1979 to 1982. In 1979, he was elected President of the World Congress of Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, which met in Rome under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

A year later, Caldera presided over the International Committee in charge of preparing an international agreement for the establishment of the University for Peace, approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 5 December 1980.

In March 1987, Caldera was invited by Pope John Paul II to deliver a speech before the College of Cardinals to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Papal Encyclical Populorum Progressio.

A leading theme in his speeches and conferences during these years was the need to find solutions to the debt crisis that gravely affected most third-world countries. His main concern was to denounce the injustice of placing the heavy burden of servicing the debt on the shoulders of the most impoverished and vulnerable people of third-world countries.
As tenured Senator in the Venezuelan National Congress, Caldera chose to use the speaker podium exclusively on matters of national importance. As the &quot;architect&quot; of the 1961 Constitution, he was called upon by leaders of all Venezuelan parties to defend its principles, validity and timeliness. Accordingly, he was chosen to deliver the commemorative speeches before special joint sessions of Congress on the 15th (1976) and 25th (1986) anniversaries of the 1961 Constitution. In 1985, he was appointed President of the Bicameral Congress Commission for the Reform of the Labor Law. After years of deliberations with workers, legal experts, labor unions, and representatives from industry and commerce chambers, the bill was presented in 1989 and passed by Congress at the end of 1990.

In June 1989, Caldera was appointed President of the Bicameral Congress Commission for the Reform of the Constitution. The reform project prepared by the commission was presented in March 1992, but did not receive the necessary support from the major political parties in Congress. This project included provisions to restructure the Judiciary as well as mechanisms to strengthen citizen participation in democracy. These changes had been demanded by most sectors of Venezuela&#x27;s society, in light of corruption in the administration of justice and insufficient means for citizens to directly participate in governmental decisions. The political events that later unfolded in 1999, and particularly President Chávez&#x27; call for a constituent assembly during the first year of his administration, reflect how consequential Congress&#x27; dismissal of this reform bill would eventually become.

The most memorable and controversial speeches Caldera delivered as Senator came in February 1989, at the wake of the bloody riots in Caracas on 27 February, known as &quot;Caracazo,&quot; and in February, 4 of 1992, after the failed military coup by Hugo Chaves. &quot;The country was in crisis. Even though Caldera was one of the main architects of the system, he was one of the first to realize its weakness. So much oil (by some estimates, in the decade after the 1973 oil price surge, Venezuela received 240 billion dollars, or five times the Marshall Plan) had led not just to dependence but widespread corruption and growing resentment from the popular sectors left off the gravy train&quot;.

In these speeches, Caldera insisted on the need to recognize the root causes of the crisis and the growing weakening of the people&#x27;s faith in democratic values and institutions. One month after the February 1992 coup, he delivered a memorable speech at Universidad Central de Venezuela condemning the country&#x27;s history with military dictatorships and coups d&#x27;état. He urged students to reject violent paths and search for answers to the crisis without abandoning the principles and mechanisms of democracy.

The 1961 Constitution did not allow former presidents to run again before ten years had elapsed after leaving office. In 1983, Caldera became eligible again and was chosen by his party COPEI to run against Jaime Lusinchi, the candidate of the opposition party AD, who won the presidential election. In 1993, Caldera ran for president as an independent candidate, with the support of a new party, National Convergence, which allowed members and sympathizers of COPEI to support his candidacy. He also received the support from a coalition of 17 small parties dismissed by opponents as &quot;chiripas&quot; (small cockroaches). Caldera won the presidency with almost 400.000 votes over his closest opponent Claudio Fermín, the candidate of AD. As it had been the case in his first administration, Caldera had to govern with an opposition majority in Congress.

===Second term in office (1994–1999) ===

Caldera&#x27;s second administration inherited and faced three adversities of great magnitude: a steep decrease in oil prices, the economic recession and high inflation of 1993, and a huge banking crisis. The fiscal deficit forced Caldera&#x27;s government to apply a severe austerity plan that included a ten per cent cut of the federal budget in 1994 and, simultaneously, a reform of fiscal legislation and the creation of SENIAT, a new tax collection agency. In January 1994, less than a month before Rafael Caldera&#x27;s inauguration, the second largest bank in Venezuela, Banco Latino, failed and was taken over by the government. As of October 1994, the government had seized more than ten failed banks. As René Salgado explains in his research on government and economics in Venezuela, &quot;the government&#x27;s bailout of the financial sector guaranteed approximately 6 billion dollars to depositors, which represented roughly 75 percent of the annual national budget and an alarming 13 percent of the gross domestic product. Additional bank failures continued throughout the year and into 1995&quot;.

In agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Caldera implemented in 1996 a new economic plan, called &quot;&quot;, which &quot;increased domestic fuel prices, liberalized interest rates, unified the exchange rate system under a temporary float, abolished controls on current and capital transactions, eliminated price controls (except for medicines), and strengthened the social safety net&quot;.

In 1997, gross domestic product (GDP) grew above five per cent and inflation rate was cut in half. The 1997 Asian financial crisis, however, brought oil prices to dramatic low levels, forcing government to make large budget cuts.

A noteworthy achievement in this administration was the tripartite agreement over labor benefits, social security, and pension funds, reached between labor unions, the private business sector, and the State, after ten years of stalled negotiations.

The fight against corruption was a central priority in Caldera&#x27;s second term. In March 1996, as the GlobalSecurity organization describes, &quot;an epochal event occurred, hardly creating a ripple in the world press. In its third plenary session, the members of the Organization of American States (OAS) adopted the Inter-American Convention against Corruption. The Convention is often referred to as the Caldera Convention, after the President of Venezuela, who was one of the driving forces behind it&quot;.

President Caldera also insisted on making corruption the central theme of the VII Ibero-American Summit of Heads State and Government, hosted by Venezuela in 1997. The renowned Venezuelan economist Moises Naím, a former member of Pérez&#x27; ministerial cabinet, and an outspoken critic of Caldera, argues that despite these efforts, Caldera&#x27;s administration was however &quot;particularly ineffectual in bringing to justice the many regulators and bankers responsible for the country&#x27;s massive banking crisis&quot;. 

Notwithstanding federal budget limitations, Caldera&#x27;s administration developed major infrastructure projects, including two water dams the Macagua II in Guayana and the Taguaza in Caracas; the regional central aqueduct in Valencia; the Mérida-El Vigía superhighway and portions of the Centro-Occidental, José Antonio Páez, and Rómulo Betancourt highways. This administration also concluded Line 3 of the Caracas Metro, the Jacobo Borges and the Cruz-Diez museums, and brought to near completion the Caracas-Cúa railroad and the Yacambú-Quíbor hydrological complex.

At the beginning of his second term, Caldera pardoned the military officers responsible for the failed coups of 4 February and 27 November 1992, a policy aimed at pacifying the insurgent military force. Many critics question in hindsight Caldera&#x27;s decision. Hugo Chávez rose to popularity and won the presidential election in 1998. The pervasiveness of this criticism grew hand in hand with Chávez&#x27;s policies, to the point that many have come to blame Caldera for Chávez&#x27;s and afterwards Nicolás Maduro&#x27;s governments.

This body of work increased significantly after the academic events organized to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Caldera&#x27;s birth. Parallel efforts on the legacy of Betancourt, Leoni, Villalba, Pérez, Herrera Campíns, and Calvani.

==Political thought==
Caldera pioneered the introduction of Christian Democracy into Latin America. He explained that Christian Democrats understand democracy in the light of Christian philosophy, and Christianity in its living democratic manifestation. For Caldera, Christian Democracy was not a middle point between liberalism and socialism. He saw it as a specific political alternative to laissez-faire capitalism and Marxist socialism. Caldera rejected Marxist ideas of dialectical materialism and class struggle, but he was also convinced that Capitalism without social safeguards produces a grossly inequitable society.

Caldera published several books and countless booklets and speeches on Christian Democratic ideals, including Ideario: &quot;La Democracia Cristiana en América Latina&quot; (1970), &quot;Justicia Social Internacional y Nacionalismo Latinoamericano&quot; (1973), &quot;El Bien Común Universal y la Justicia Social Internacional&quot; (1976), and &quot;Reflexiones de la Rábida&quot; (1976).

His &quot;Especificidad de la Democracia Cristiana&quot; (Christian Democracy) (1972), a handbook of Christian democratic principles and programmatic ideas, has been translated into several languages, including English, German, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Romanian, and Polish. In this book, Caldera develops a conception of democracy that integrates personalist, pluralistic, communitarian, participatory and organic dimensions.

This understanding of democracy, Caldera explains, rests upon foundational principles of Christian philosophy: affirmation of the spiritual, the subordination of politics to ethical norms, the dignity of the human person, the primacy of the common good, and the perfectibility of civil society. Caldera describes the concept of integral human development, the fundamental value of labor, the social function and forms of property, the role of the State in social life, the principle of subsidiarity, the defense of the rights of social groups, and the concept of international social justice. He viewed these principles as a set of political ideas committed to social justice and inspired by the Catholic social teaching.

The concept of &quot;international social justice&quot; was perhaps Caldera&#x27;s most unique and original contribution to the body of Christian Democratic thought. In the speech he delivered to the joint session of the US Congress in 1970, he explained:

The substance of Caldera&#x27;s concept of international social justice gradually influenced the social doctrine of the Catholic Church, beginning with Pope John XXIII&#x27;s Encyclical Mater et Magistra. Eventually, the term itself was included in official Vatican documents. Pope Paul VI, for instance, in a letter written to the Secretary General of the United Nations, on the occasion of the Extraordinary General Assembly devoted to the study of the problem of raw materials and development, wrote: &quot;The Church is firmly convinced that any acceptable solution must be based upon international social justice and upon human solidarity through which those principles can be practically applied.

Perhaps there is no statement that better captures the essence of Caldera&#x27;s political ideals than the words that Pope John Paul II used in his address to President Caldera on 5 May 1995, on the occasion of the Venezuelan President&#x27;s visit to the Vatican:

==Intellectual and academic life==
Long viewed as the most principled and legally minded of Venezuela&#x27;s presidents, Caldera was a man of learning, and an accomplished essayist and orator. Despite never having remained longer than one month outside Venezuela, he was fluent in English, French, and Italian, and proficient in German and Portuguese.

A full professor in Labor Law and Juridical Sociology at Central University of Venezuela and Andrés Bello Catholic University, in Caracas, he taught almost without interruption from 1943 to 1968. Throughout his lifetime, Caldera was bestowed with honorary doctorates, degrees, and professorships from a dozen universities and academies in Venezuela, and from thirty universities worldwide, including: the University of Louvain (1979), in Belgium; Perugia (1973), in Italy; Hebrew of Jerusalem (1981), in Israel; Notre Dame (1964) and the Catholic University of America (1980), in the United States; Renmin (1993), in China; and The Sorbonne (1998), in France. The distinction Caldera most cherished, however, was the Honorary Professor award with which his alma mater, Central University of Venezuela, unanimously honored him in 1976.

In 1953, Caldera was elected to the Venezuelan National Academy of Political and Social Sciences. His induction speech was entitled &quot;Idea de una sociología venezolana&quot;, an exposition of key elements for the development of sociological studies in the country. In 1967, he was elected to the Venezuelan National Academy of Language. He devoted his induction speech, &quot;El lenguaje como vínculo social y la integración latinoamericana&quot; to language as a social link for Latin American integration.

Throughout his life, Caldera maintained his passion for the Venezuelan man-of-letters Andrés Bello. To his early book Andrés Bello, he added a considerable number of essays, prologues, and book chapters, including, among others, &quot;El pensamiento jurídico y social de Andrés Bello&quot; (1988), &quot;Andrés Bello: Bicentenario de su nacimiento&quot; (1981), and &quot;Caracas, Londres, Santiago de Chile: Las tres etapas de la vida de Bello&quot; (1981).

Caldera also wrote extensively on key personalities and events in Venezuela&#x27;s history. His book &quot;Bolivar siempre&quot; is a collection of essays on the timeliness of Simon Bolivar&#x27;s political ideals. To this genre also belong such texts as &quot;El general Páez de a pie&quot; (1940), &quot;Antonio José de Sucre: Demasiado joven para tanta gloria&quot; (1980), &quot;Eleazar López Contreras, lindero y puente entre dos épocas&quot; (1973), and &quot;Andrés Eloy Blanco, el amortiguador de la Constituyente&quot; (1958), compiled many of them in different editions of the book &quot;Moldes para la fragua&quot;.

Especially notable is the monograph Caldera dedicated to the analysis of Romulo Betancourt&#x27;s foundational role in the construction of Venezuela&#x27;s democracy, &quot;La parábola vital de Rómulo Betancourt&quot; (1988).

The various texts Caldera devoted to reflections on the intersection between faith and public service are key to understand the spiritual drive behind his unwavering commitment to political and intellectual pursuits. Any thorough analysis of the life and works of Rafael Caldera must include &quot;La Hora de Emaús&quot; (1956), as well as such texts as &quot;Aquel obrero que llamamos Cristo&quot;(1956), &quot;Lo político y lo religioso dentro de lo social, a propósito de Luigi Sturzo&quot; (1953), &quot;Jacques Maritain: Fe en Dios y en el pueblo&quot; (1980), &quot;Los valores cristianos&quot; (1971), and the commencement speech &quot;Un mensaje de fe&quot; (1971), that Caldera delivered at the high school graduation ceremony of his son Andrés.

== Last years and death ==

At the conclusion of his presidency, Caldera returned to his home, just as he did at the end of his first term. He was known for living simply and eschewing luxuries, and for being an honorable public servant in a country where corruption is pervasive. In 1999, when President Chávez called for a constituent assembly, Caldera protested against the violation of the 1961 Constitution. Allan Brewer-Carías, a Venezuelan legal scholar and elected member of this assembly, explains that this constitution-making body was an instrument for the gradual dismantling of democratic institutions and values.
In 1999, Caldera published his last book, &quot;De Carabobo a Puntofijo: Los Causahabientes&quot; (From Carabobo to Puntofijo, The Causates), a political history of Venezuela from 1830 to 1958. This book includes in its postscript an assessment of Venezuela&#x27;s democratic experience from 1958 to 1999, and criticism of the Bolivarian government.

Gravely affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Caldera gradually withdrew from public view and died in his home on Christmas Eve 2009.
A family man and devout Catholic, he married Alicia Pietri Montemayor on 6 August 1941. They had six children: Mireya, Rafael Tomás, Juan José, Alicia Helena, Cecilia and Andrés. At the time of his death, the couple had twelve grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Mrs. Caldera died a little more than a year after her husband, on 9 February 2011.

<text>Mark Seibert (born 1960) is an American musician, composer, and producer best known for his work on various video games from Sierra Entertainment.

==Biography==
Seibert was born in California, U.S. From 1979 to 1986, he performed guitar and vocals for a Christian band called Omega Sunrise. He recorded two albums with the group in 1983 and 1985, the second of which saw moderate success in various US markets. After a final concert in Fresno, California in 1986, the group broke up due to the demands of constant touring.

Mark Seibert claims he is most proud of his compositions in Phantasmagoria (1995). He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in music at California State University, Fresno in 1983, and also started on a second degree in Math in 1986. As of 2014, he was working as a mathematics teacher at the Perry Hall Christian School in Maryland.

In 1987, Seibert answered a newspaper advertisement from a computer game company called Sierra On-Line. After several months of delay, the company hired him as a musician and music editor for &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella&quot;. He worked as a musician on this and other projects, but after only a few years, he was promoted to the company&#x27;s music director. This meant that he worked with staff musicians in both composition and editing.

In 1992, he was promoted again to producer, which meant he was involved in all aspects of game production, not just the music. However, this also meant that he was less able to actually compose music, though he did continue to perform pieces by other composers. He left the company in 2001.

Despite having produced numerous adventure games over his career, in a 1997 interview Seibert said that though he likes the genre, he had never played one through to the end: &quot;I always get halfway through and get stuck someplace, and then I have to download the walk-through off the Internet and read the solution, and it&#x27;s always like, &#x27;Well that&#x27;s a stupid puzzle!&#x27; I get so frustrated, I throw it down and never pick it back up.&quot;

Later he went to work for Gentle Revolution Software as the Director of Development. He worked with NASA on a game centered around the International Space Station.

He has been married to Debbie Seibert since 1980. They have two daughters (Kirsten - b. 1991, Kaitlin - b. 1994).

<doc id="219328" wikidata="Q775289" url="?curid=219328" title="Heap overflow">
<text>A heap overflow, heap overrun, or heap smashing is a type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap data area. Heap overflows are exploitable in a different manner to that of stack-based overflows. Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated at runtime and typically contains program data. Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers. The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as codice_1 metadata) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer.

For example, on older versions of Linux, two buffers allocated next to each other on the heap could result in the first buffer overwriting the second buffer&#x27;s metadata. By setting the in-use bit to zero of the second buffer and setting the length to a small negative value which allows null bytes to be copied, when the program calls codice_2 on the first buffer it will attempt to merge these two buffers into a single buffer. When this happens, the buffer that is assumed to be freed will be expected to hold two pointers FD and BK in the first 8 bytes of the formerly allocated buffer. BK gets written into FD and can be used to overwrite a pointer.

==Consequences==

An accidental overflow may result in data corruption or unexpected behavior by any process that accesses the affected memory area. On operating systems without memory protection, this could be any process on the system.

For example, a Microsoft JPEG GDI+ buffer overflow vulnerability could allow remote execution of code on the affected machine.

iOS jailbreaking often uses heap overflows to gain arbitrary code execution.

==Detection and prevention==

As with buffer overflows there are primarily three ways to protect against heap overflows. Several modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux provide some implementation of all three.

* Prevent execution of the payload by separating the code and data, typically with hardware features such as NX-bit
* Introduce randomization so the heap is not found at a fixed offset, typically with kernel features such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
* Introduce sanity checks into the heap manager

Since version 2.3.6 the GNU libc includes protections that can detect heap overflows after the fact, for example by checking pointer consistency when calling codice_3. However, those protections against prior exploits were almost immediately shown to also be exploitable. In addition, Linux has included support for ASLR since 2005, although PaX introduced a better implementation years before. Also Linux has included support for NX-bit since 2004.

Microsoft has included protections against heap resident buffer overflows since April 2003 in Windows Server 2003 and August 2004 in Windows XP with Service Pack 2. These mitigations were safe unlinking and heap entry header cookies. Later versions of Windows such as Vista, Server 2008 and Windows 7 include: Removal of commonly targeted data structures, heap entry metadata randomization, expanded role of heap header cookie, randomized heap base address, function pointer encoding, termination of heap corruption and algorithm variation. Normal Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and ASLR also help to mitigate this attack.

The most common detection method for heap overflows is online dynamic analysis. This method observes the runtime execution of programs to identify vulnerabilities through the detection of security breaches.

<doc id="219333" wikidata="Q2878265" url="?curid=219333" title="Bachelor of Civil Law">
<text>Bachelor of Civil Law (abbreviated BCL or B.C.L.; ) is the name of various degrees in law conferred by English-language universities. The BCL originated as a postgraduate degree in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge; at Oxford, the BCL continues to be the primary postgraduate taught course in law. It is also taught as an undergraduate degree in other countries. The reference to civil law was not originally in contradistinction to common law, but to canon law, although common law was not taught in the civil law faculties in either university until at least the second half of the 18th century. However, some universities in English-speaking countries use the degree in the former sense.

==Postgraduate degrees==

===The modern BCL: Oxford===
At Oxford, the Bachelor of Civil Law degree is a taught postgraduate degree in English law, occupying a similar position as the Master of Laws (M.L. or LL.M.; Latin: &#x27; or &#x27;) programmes of other British universities, but specifically for Common Law degree holders. Students with Civil Law degrees following the same programme are awarded the degree of &quot;Magister Juris&quot; (commonly MJur). Oxford claims that the BCL is &quot;the most highly regarded taught masters-level qualification in the Common Law world&quot;. The course differs from many LLM programmes insofar as it provides not only seminar and lecture-format teaching, but also the intensive small-group tutorials that characterize Oxbridge&#x27;s undergraduate tutorial system. The principal mode of assessment for the BCL and MJur is end-of-year examinations held in Oxford&#x27;s Examination Schools, after the end of Trinity term. The degree is either an overall &quot;pass&quot; or an overall &quot;distinction&quot;, the latter requiring more than 70 marks in two or more of the four courses, and not less than 60 in any of the courses. The Vinerian Scholarship is awarded to the student deemed to have the best overall performance on the BCL; examples of past Vinerian Scholars include the Law Lords Lord Hoffmann, Lord Edmund-Davies and Lord Saville.

Historically, the BCL was established as the lower degree in Oxford&#x27;s Faculty of Civil Law, the higher degree being the Doctor of Civil Law. The Faculty of Civil Law was so named to distinguish it from the faculty of Canon Law which was abolished in both universities by King Henry VIII in 1535. In the 16th century, it generally took three years to study for the BCL if the student had previously obtained a Master of Arts degree at Oxford (and one additional year if his degree was from Cambridge). It was, however, possible to enter the Faculty of Law directly after matriculation as a &#x27;Student in Civil Law&#x27;, without even a Bachelor of Arts (BA) first. In this case, it took four to six years to take the BCL. From the 1850s, the BCL could only be taken by those who had an Oxford BA, but at the end of the 19th century the course was restructured: While it was still possible for Oxford BAs to complete it in one year, graduates from other universities were also admitted to the BCL, though as a two-year taught degree course. This dual structure was still in place in the 1960s, but at least since 1991, the BCL has been a one-year course both for graduates from Oxford, and elsewhere. In 1991, the MJur was introduced as a degree in European and Comparative Law. Around 2000, this was reshaped into a degree with the same structure and papers as the BCL, but for graduates from non-Common Law backgrounds.

The syllabus consisted entirely of Roman Civil Law until the establishment of the Vinerian Professorship of English Law in 1758. Undergraduate examinations in law were not established until 1850, with the separate BA undergraduate &#x27;Honour School of Jurisprudence&#x27; being established in 1872. Before 1960, there were seven papers, of which six were compulsory: &#x27;Jurisprudence&#x27;, the &#x27;Roman Law of Ownership and Possession&#x27;, the &#x27;Roman Law of Condictiones&#x27;, &#x27;Common Law&#x27; (comprising the general principles of contract, torts, and crime), &#x27;Equity&#x27;, and &#x27;Conflict of Laws&#x27;. The optional paper was to be chosen from either the &#x27;Law of Evidence&#x27;, the &#x27;Law of Negotiable Instruments&#x27;, specified topics in Public International Law, or the &#x27;Roman-Dutch Law of Testamentary and Intestate Succession&#x27;. In 1960, the syllabus was changed to six papers, of which four were compulsory: &#x27;Common Law&#x27; (as above), the &#x27;Roman Law of Ownership and Possession&#x27;, &#x27;Equity&#x27;, and &#x27;Conflict of Laws&#x27;. The two optional papers were to be chosen from either the &#x27;Development of Modern Jurisprudence&#x27;, the &#x27;Roman Law of Condictiones&#x27;, the &#x27;Law of Evidence&#x27;, &#x27;Criminal Law and Penology&#x27;, &#x27;Public International Law&#x27;, &#x27;Roman Dutch Law&#x27;, &#x27;Legal History: the Legislation of Edward I&#x27;, &#x27;Administrative Law&#x27;, or the &#x27;Comparative Law of Matrimonial Causes&#x27;. For non-Oxford graduates, there was a preliminary examination after the first year. Presently, four papers can be chosen from a wide range of options.

The academic dress for both BCL and MJur graduates consists of the lay faculties&#x27; masters&#x27; gown with a hood of steel blue silk, half lined and bound with white rabbit fur.

===The historical BCL: Elsewhere===
The Faculty of Civil Law in Cambridge was renamed the Faculty of Laws after the teaching of English Common Law was introduced in the 19th century. The initial postgraduate degree in the faculty became the Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB, or LL.B.; ), before being retitled LLM in the 20th century in order to clarify its status as a postgraduate degree. The BCL degree in Durham University is now also titled LLM. Within the UK, only the law faculty at Oxford has retained the older nomenclature.

Before it was renamed in 1969 as the LLB, the bachelor&#x27;s degree in Common Law conferred by Canada&#x27;s University of New Brunswick was known as the Bachelor of Civil Law.

Until replaced by the Juris Doctor (JD, or J.D.) in 1967, the Bachelor of Civil Law was the degree granted by the first law school in the United States, the William &amp; Mary School of Law founded in 1779.

==Undergraduate degrees==

===Ireland===

The BCL degree is also a standard law degree in Ireland. It is awarded by constituent universities of the National University of Ireland, such as University College Cork, University College Dublin and the National University of Ireland, Galway and National University of Ireland, Maynooth. The BCL degree is also offered by Dublin City University. Other Irish universities, including the University of Limerick and the Trinity College Dublin, award the LLB. degree. The LLB is offered at postgraduate level by University College Cork, NUI, Galway, and the University of Limerick also.

== Degrees specifically in civil law ==

=== Canada (BCL/LLB/LLL) ===

The legal system in Canada principally adopts the English Common Law legal tradition in all provinces and territories, excluding Quebec. For historical reasons, Quebec has a hybrid legal system born of its French-heritage in civil law. As a result, universities in Quebec (and others wishing to offer degrees suitable for practitioners in Quebec) must provide training in both Civil and Common Law.

At McGill University, the bachelor&#x27;s degree in Quebec Civil Law is called the BCL, to distinguish it from the first degree in Common Law (i.e., the JD) offered by that same university. Graduates earn both degrees concurrently after three to four years of study.

The University of Ottawa, although located in Ontario, also offers a baccalaureate degree in Quebec Civil Law, which it styles the Licentiate of Laws (LLL or LL.L.; ), to distinguish it from the first degree in Common Law (i.e., the LLB, now renamed JD) offered by that same university.

The other universities in Quebec that offer a baccalaureate degree in Quebec Civil Law (, Université du Québec à Montréal, Université Laval and ) call it an &#x27;LL.B.&#x27; () though, in the past, the degree at and Université Laval was styled as &#x27;LL.L.&#x27;.

These bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Quebec Civil Law are a first-entry degree programme which, like other first-entry university programmes in any discipline in Quebec, require a college diploma for entry. Except in the cases of both Ottawa and McGill, they are three years in length. The Common Law LLB and Quebec Civil Law LLL are combined in programmes offered by both the University of Ottawa, and McGill University. McGill offers a &quot;transystemic program&quot; of 105 credits. Students can choose to complete the curriculum in 3, 3.5, or 4 years. Admission to the McGill programme can be a first-entry programme, in the case of Quebec students (30 students every year are admitted straight out of college while others still need an undergraduate degree even if they are from the Province of Québec), though it is a second-entry programme in the case of students from other provinces (as three to four years of university studies is required, effectively at least two extra years of study more than for a college diploma).

While the baccalaureate degree in Quebec Civil Law is the terminal professional degree for entry into the bar admission programme of the &quot;Barreau du Québec&quot;, a candidate for entry into the training programme of the &quot;Chambre des notaires du Québec&quot; must, after that baccalaureate degree, go on to obtain a Diploma of Notarial Law through graduate study (&quot;Diplôme de deuxième cycle en droit notarial&quot;) from , Université Laval, Université d&#x27;Ottawa, or : requiring two semesters of full-time study. At , by completing two additional graduate-level law classes and doing a directed studies paper, the student may also earn an LLM in Notarial Law, in addition to the Diploma.

===Louisiana (United States)===

The Louisiana Civil Code requires legal practitioners in the state to have education in both Civil Law, and Common Law, and necessarily sets it apart from other jurisdictions in the U.S.

The Paul M. Hebert Law Center on the campus of Louisiana State University in the U.S. confers on the graduates of its law program a combined Juris Doctor / Diploma of Civil Law (styled D.C.L. or DCL) in view of the Louisiana Civil Law components of the program. The DCL (which was awarded as a BCL for those classes graduating in the 2003–06 academic years) reflects the 15 added credit hours of legal study in Civil Law, and comparative international law, in addition to that which is required for achieving the standard JD. The additional course hours, which are roughly equal to one additional semester of study, are generally achieved through a combination of taking summer course offerings, on campus or abroad, as well as via one or more other available routes offered by the Law Center.

<doc id="219337" wikidata="Q3505782" url="?curid=219337" title="Salmiya">
<text>Salmiya () is an area in Hawalli Governorate in Kuwait.

Salmiya is administratively divided into 12 blocks. The blocks located closer to the interior of the district tend to be mostly residential, while those located beside the Persian Gulf coastline have a great deal of commercial and up-scale residential real estate. The interior residential areas boast a huge population of foreigners consisting mainly of those from the Indian sub-continent and other Arabs who are not native to the Persian Gulf area. Approximately, two-thirds of the district&#x27;s population reside in blocks 8 to 12. These blocks are highly desirable among the residents due to its urban amenities and the well-designed infrastructure, including the city&#x27;s public works and built environment, enhances the overall quality of life for its residents.

==Facilities==

Salmiya hosts numerous museums, mosques, an aquarium, a Scientific Center, IMAX movie theaters, football stadium, medical centers, a Roman Catholic Chapel, the district passport office (&quot;Jawazat&quot;) and a well-equipped park beside the 5th Ring Road. Notable malls include the Salmiya Souq Mega-mall which was the first mall in the nation, Marina Mall in the Marina World shopping and entertainment district, and the Omariya mall. The Gulf Road is coveted for its amazing sea vistas and is the main hub for new construction of future buildings and renovations. A boulevard passing through much of coastal Salmiya is a reflection of Kuwait&#x27;s drive to modernity.

The Salem Al-Mubarak Street shopping district, commonly known as Salmiya Center, runs down the outer blocks of Salmiya. It is one of the oldest and largest shopping districts of Kuwait. It is a remnant of Kuwait&#x27;s once numerous traditional souk bazaars, similar to the ones located in Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh and the centre Kuwait City. Well known in the past for pearls, gold and jewellery, it now consists of a wide array of retail giants and local outlets. Much of the old souk had been built over, but the feel and atmosphere of the past albeit remains visible at the traditional precincts of this shopping district. The experience varies from modernized (and Westernized) in the strip malls, to a true Kuwaiti experience on some of the back streets. It is notable to point out that the more eastward away from the capital one moves along the strip, the fancier and pricier the shops are in general. There are many gold and fabric shops in the &quot;Old Souk&quot; area located onwards from the intersection of the 4th Ring Road and the strip.

==History==
Salmiya has been a model district in the context of modernization. It has undertaken a major face lift in recent times primarily due to ever-expanding commercial real estate on the Gulf Road. The popular Salem Al-Mubarak Shopping strip is in relative close proximity to the capital. The boom in real estate in Salmiya has seen its demographics being constantly on the move. Increasing rental prices have gradually pushed out its working class expatriate community towards the interior districts of Kuwait.

The influx of foreigners to Salmiya is of historical importance dating as far back as the 1960s. During the Gulf War Salmiya was destroyed by invading Iraqi occupation, but from 1993 onward it was gradually rebuilt and re-populated. The old rugged 3-storied buildings and open fields, which Salmiya was famous for, have given way to high density layouts of high-rise apartments and complexes. The beach front, once a hub and harbor for the fishing and pearl diving community, has been transformed into a well-developed and modern bustling commercial avenue. Salmiya is also one of the most expensive area for real estate in the country.

<text>Quinoline Yellow WS is a mixture of organic compounds derived from the dye Quinoline Yellow SS (spirit soluble). Owing to the presence of sulfonate groups, the WS dyes are water-soluble (WS). It is a mixture of disulfonates (principally), monosulfonates and trisulfonates of 2-(2-quinolyl)indan-1,3-dione with a maximum absorption wavelength of 416 nm.p. 119

==Uses==
Quinoline Yellow is used as a greenish yellow food additive in certain countries, designated in Europe as the E number E104. In the EU and Australia, Quinoline Yellow is permitted in beverages and is used in foods, like sauces, decorations, and coatings; Quinoline Yellow is not listed as a permitted food additive in Canada or the US, where it is permitted in medicines and cosmetics and is known as D&amp;C Yellow 10. The Codex Alimentarius does not list it.

==Health effects==
Quinoline Yellow WS has not been associated with any significant long-term toxicity, is not genotoxic or carcinogenic and there is no evidence of adverse effects on reproduction or development. Food colorants in general have been the subject of much scrutiny for their effect on health.

=== Possible cause of hyperactivity ===
Since the 1970s and the well-publicized advocacy of Benjamin Feingold, there has been public concern that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children. These concerns have led the U.S. FDA and other food safety authorities to regularly review the scientific literature, and led the UK FSA to commission a study by researchers at the University of Southampton to assess the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow FCF and Carmoisine (dubbed the &quot;Southampton 6&quot;)) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007. The study found &quot;a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity&quot; in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended&quot;.

The European regulatory community, with a stronger emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labelling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers. However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that &quot;the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects&quot;. On the basis of other evidence the EFSA also reduced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) from 10 to 0.5 mg/kg.

The US FDA did not make changes following the publication of the Southampton study, but following a citizen petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in 2008, requesting the FDA ban several food additives, the FDA commenced a review of the available evidence, and still made no changes.

No evidence supports broad claims that food coloring causes food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children. It is possible that certain food coloring may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence is weak.
