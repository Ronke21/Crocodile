<text>Laci Denise Peterson (née Rocha; May 4, 1975 — ) was an American woman murdered by her husband, Scott Lee Peterson (born October 24, 1972), while eight months pregnant with their first child. The case has remained a subject of public interest and discussion, raising questions about the legal process and media coverage.

In 2002, Scott reported Laci missing from their home in Modesto, California. The next year, the remains of Laci and her unborn son, whom the couple had planned to name Conner, were discovered on the shores of San Francisco Bay. Scott was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of murder. In 2004, he was found guilty of the first-degree murder of Laci and the second-degree murder of Conner. His death sentence was overturned in 2020. The next year, Scott was re-sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In 2024, he was granted a status hearing in response to a request by the LA Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization claiming to have new evidence supporting his innocence.

==Early life and marriage==
===Laci Denise Peterson===
Laci was born Laci Denise Rocha on May 4, 1975. She was the younger of two children born to Sharon () and Dennis Robert Rocha, and had an older brother named Brent (born 1971). Her parents had met in high school and owned a dairy farm west of Escalon, California.

Laci worked on the dairy farm from a young age and also enjoyed gardening with her mother. Laci&#x27;s parents divorced when she and her brother were young. Subsequently, their mother moved with the children to Modesto; Laci visited her father at the dairy farm on weekends. 

Laci&#x27;s mother developed a long-term relationship with Ron Grantski; Grantski would help raise the children from the time Laci was two years old. Laci was a cheerleader in junior high and high school. After graduating from Thomas Downey High School, she attended California Polytechnic State University, majoring in ornamental horticulture.

===Scott Lee Peterson===

Scott was born October 24, 1972, in San Diego, California, to Lee Arthur Peterson, who owned a crate-packaging company, and Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Helen Latham, who owned a boutique in La Jolla called The Put On. Lee and Jackie had six children from previous relationships. Scott was their only child together. As a child, Scott shared a bedroom with his half-brother John in the family&#x27;s two-bedroom apartment in La Jolla. He began playing golf at an early age, and, by age 14, he could beat his father at the game. For a time, Scott had dreams of becoming a professional golfer, and he was teammates with future-pro Phil Mickelson at the University of San Diego High School. By the end of high school, he was one of the top junior golfers in San Diego.

In 1990, Scott enrolled at Arizona State University (where Mickelson had also enrolled) on a partial golf scholarship. Scott&#x27;s father, Lee, later testified that Scott was discouraged by the considerable competition that Mickelson and an unnamed future pro presented. According to Chip Couch, the father of another young golfer, Chris Couch, Scott was taken off the golf team after Chip discovered that Scott had taken Chris out drinking while Chris was visiting Arizona State for a recruiting trip. Chip complained to the Arizona State golf coach, who subsequently kicked Scott off the team. Scott transferred to Cuesta College and then to California Polytechnic State University. Initially planning to major in international business, Scott ultimately graduated with a degree in agricultural business. Professors who taught Scott described him as a model student. His agribusiness professor, Jim Ahern, commented, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a class full of Scott Petersons.&quot;

===Relationship===
While at Cal Poly, Scott worked at Pacific Café, a restaurant in Morro Bay. Laci would occasionally visit the restaurant to see a friend who also worked there. In mid-1994, Laci sent Scott her phone number; she also told her mother that she had met the man that she would marry. Scott later called Laci, and they began dating. As the relationship grew more serious, Scott put aside his dreams of professional golf in order to focus on a business career.

The couple dated for two years and eventually moved in together. In 1997, after Laci graduated, they married at Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort. While Scott finished his senior year, Laci took a job in nearby Prunedale. Prosecutors later stated that, around this time, Scott engaged in his first extramarital affair, though they did not reveal the details of the relationship. Scott graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural business in June 1998, and the Petersons opened a sports bar in San Luis Obispo called The Shack. The Petersons decided to put The Shack up for sale when they moved to Laci&#x27;s hometown of Modesto, California, to start a family; they completed the sale in April 2001.

In October 2000, the Petersons purchased a three-bedroom, two-bath bungalow for $177,000 on Covena Avenue in an upscale neighborhood near East La Loma Park. Laci took a part-time job as a substitute teacher, and Scott got a job with Tradecorp U.S.A., a newly founded subsidiary of a European fertilizer company, for which he earned a salary of $5,000 a month before taxes.

Laci&#x27;s family, including her mother and younger sister, related that she devoted much of her energy towards being the perfect housewife, and that she enjoyed cooking, entertaining and watching Martha Stewart. In 2002, Laci discovered she was pregnant; her due date was February 10, 2003. The couple had planned to name their son Conner. In November 2002, Scott was introduced by a friend to Amber Frey, a Fresno massage therapist, and the two began a romantic relationship.

==Laci&#x27;s disappearance==
On December 23, 2002, at 5:45 p.m., Laci and Scott went to Salon Salon, the workplace of Laci&#x27;s sister Amy Rocha. Amy cut Scott&#x27;s hair, as she did each month. Scott offered to pick up a fruit basket that Amy had ordered because he would be playing golf the next day at a course near the retailer. Prosecutors say Scott also told other people he would play golf on Christmas Eve. Laci&#x27;s mother, Sharon, spoke with Laci on the telephone around 8:30 that evening. The last three people known to have spoken to Laci before she disappeared were Amy, Sharon, and Scott.

Scott later told police that he last saw his wife about 9:30 a.m. on December 24, when he left to go fishing at the Berkeley Marina. He said Laci was watching a Martha Stewart TV show about meringue and preparing to mop the floor, bake cookies, and walk the family dog to a nearby park. Karen Servas, a neighbor of the Petersons, said that she found the Petersons&#x27; dog, a golden retriever named McKenzie, alone outside the home and returned him to the Petersons&#x27; back yard at around 10:30 a.m. She later testified that she had found the dog at 10:18. Another neighbor, Mike Chiavetta, said he saw McKenzie at about 10:45 a.m., as he played catch with his own dog. &quot;The Modesto Bee&quot; reported that an unnamed female neighbor found the dog with a muddy leash, wandering in the neighborhood. That neighbor put the dog in the Petersons&#x27; yard, not observing that anything was out of place. At 2:15 p.m., Scott left a message for Laci, stating, &quot;Hey, Beautiful. It&#x27;s 2:15. I&#x27;m leaving Berkeley.&quot;

Scott said when he returned home that afternoon, Laci&#x27;s car was in the driveway and the house was empty. He also said that he found McKenzie in their back yard, and that he relayed this to Laci&#x27;s mother, Sharon. She later denied his account in her book. Scott showered and washed his clothes. A neighbor of Scott&#x27;s later said that Scott had knocked on his door, asking if he had seen Laci. The neighbor and his wife both testified overhearing Scott saying that he had been golfing that day and had tried to call Laci. A relative of Laci&#x27;s would also later testify that, when friends and family began gathering at the Peterson home that night, Scott said he had earlier gone to play golf.

Scott called his mother-in-law, Sharon, to ask if Laci was with her; Sharon subsequently said that call was when she learned Laci was missing. Scott and Laci&#x27;s stepfather both reported Laci missing. The police received the report of her disappearance shortly before 6pm. At the time of her disappearance, Laci was seven-and-a-half months pregnant, with a due date of February 10, 2003. The story attracted nationwide media interest.

=== Search and investigation ===
Modesto Police detectives Allen Brocchini and Jon Buehler responded to the missing person call, and became the lead investigators for the case. Upon their arrival at the Peterson home, the detectives interviewed Scott and performed a cursory search of the home. Scott told detectives he had been fishing for sturgeon at the Berkeley Marina, approximately 90 miles from the couple&#x27;s Modesto home. The detectives found Laci&#x27;s keys, wallet, sunglasses, and purse in a closet, and began organizing a search of the area.

The following day, over 900 of Laci&#x27;s family, friends, and neighbors searched the neighborhood and posted missing-person flyers. At a press conference, detective Al Brocchini said police did not believe Laci left without contacting her family: &quot;That is completely out of character for her.&quot; Over thirty Modesto police and firefighters on foot, horseback, bicycles, and watercraft used canine units and searchlight-equipped helicopters to search Dry Creek and the surrounding area. Laci&#x27;s disappearance and the extensive search efforts attracted nationwide media interest.

A $25,000 reward was offered—later increased to $250,000 and, finally, to $500,000—for information leading to Laci&#x27;s safe return. Posters, blue and yellow ribbons, and flyers were circulated. The original, basic version of the LaciPeterson.com website was launched by the husband of one of Laci&#x27;s friends. Family, friends, and volunteers set up a command center at the Red Lion Hotel to take phone calls, record developments, and circulate information. Over 1500 volunteers distributed information, worked at the command center, searched for Laci, and held candlelight vigils with Scott for Laci. 

Although detectives did not initially consider the case suspicious, they suspected foul play almost immediately and became increasingly suspicious of Scott as they continued their investigation into Laci&#x27;s disappearance. Buehler told ABC News in 2017, &quot;I suspected Scott when I first met him. Didn&#x27;t mean he did it, but I was a little bit thrown off by his calm, cool demeanor and his lack of questioning... he wasn&#x27;t, &#x27;Will you call me back? Can I have one of your cards? What are you guys doing now?. Buehler further described Scott&#x27;s behavior as, &quot;a strange combination of polite and arrogant, disaffectedly distant and impatiently irritable. He just didn&#x27;t seem like a man who was crushed or even greatly disturbed by his wife&#x27;s disappearance and possible death.&quot; The Rocha family defended Scott, describing him and Laci as the ideal couple.

=== Discovery of affair ===
The nationwide media coverage produced several tips and possible sightings, one of which was from a woman who identified herself as Scott&#x27;s girlfriend. On December 30, 2002, Amber Frey informed detectives she had met Scott on November 20, and he said he was single. Additionally, Frey told detectives Scott said on December 9, he was a widower and this Christmas would be his first without his wife. Based on the dates and information Frey provided, detectives now believed Scott began planning to kill Laci two weeks before Laci&#x27;s disappearance. Hoping Scott would confess or reveal information about his involvement in Laci&#x27;s disappearance, detectives gave Frey a device with which to record her conversations with Scott.

On January 15, 2003, detectives informed Laci&#x27;s immediate family of Scott&#x27;s affair with Amber. Upon learning of Scott&#x27;s involvement with Amber Frey, Sharon Rocha told detectives she believed Scott killed Laci. On January 24, Sharon, Ron, and Laci&#x27;s brother Brent held a press conference in which Brent said Scott had, in a phone call on January 16, told Brent he was having an affair with a woman in Fresno. Brent Rocha also stated the Rochas no longer supported Scott Peterson, due to his refusal to communicate with the family and cooperate with the police. Later the same day, Amber Frey held a press conference and explained her role in the investigation.

=== Discovery of bodies ===
On April 13, 2003, two people walking their dog found the body of a male fetus on a tidal flat of the San Francisco Bay shore in Richmond&#x27;s Point Isabel Regional Shoreline park. The following day, a jogger spotted a human torso in the riprap along the Point Isabel shoreline, approximately one mile from where the body of the fetus was found. On April 18, 2003, DNA tests verified the bodies were Laci and her unborn son, Conner.

The autopsies on both bodies were performed by forensic pathologist Dr. Brian Peterson (no relation). Although a judge sealed the autopsy results, an anonymous Associated Press source revealed Conner&#x27;s body had minor decomposition, mutilations on his right side, and a length of nylon cord wrapped around his body. The source of the mutilations and how the cord became wrapped around Conner&#x27;s body could not be conclusively determined. 

Laci&#x27;s body was bloated, missing her head, arms, most of her legs, her internal organs, and was severely decomposed. The autopsy revealed Laci had two cracked ribs and her uterus and cervix were intact. Neither Laci&#x27;s date of death nor whether the broken ribs occurred postmortem could be conclusively determined. The missing head and limbs led to rumors that Scott had dismembered Laci beforehand, but Dr. Peterson found no human-made incisions. Dr. Peterson and state forensic pathologists testified the missing organs and disarticulation were conditions consistent with a body weighted at the wrists and ankles and submerged in seawater for several months. Laci&#x27;s head, arms, and legs were never recovered.

Dr. Peterson concluded Conner had died in utero and his body was expelled from Laci&#x27;s decomposing corpse when the skin over the abdominal cavity ruptured due to natural decompositional processes. Seawater entered the abdominal cavity and washed out most of Laci&#x27;s internal organs, as well as Conner.

=== Post-discovery investigation and developments ===
The discovery of Laci&#x27;s and Conner&#x27;s bodies changed the case status from missing person to homicide, and allowed the detectives to expand their investigation of Scott Peterson as the prime suspect. The FBI and Modesto Police Department performed forensic searches of the Peterson home. Using mitochondrial DNA testing, the FBI linked a hair wrapped around a pair of pliers found in Scott&#x27;s fishing boat to hairs recovered from Laci&#x27;s hairbrush. Police searched Scott&#x27;s truck, toolbox, and warehouse, and found a homemade concrete anchor in the boat Scott purchased two weeks before he reported Laci missing.

Scott told detectives he used a 90-pound bag of concrete to make one boat anchor, and used the rest of the concrete to repair his driveway. When Detective Henry &quot;Dodge&quot; Hendee searched Scott&#x27;s warehouse on December 27, he found a cement powder on the boat trailer, and five circular marks matching the size and shape of the bucket used to make the anchor. Hendee also found a sledgehammer and a dustpan covered with cement powder. Prosecutors alleged Scott made five anchors and used four – one tied to each of Laci&#x27;s wrists and ankles – to sink Laci&#x27;s body in San Francisco Bay. After Scott was arrested, police searched the San Francisco Bay for the anchors, but nothing was found.

Using a GPS locator they&#x27;d placed on Scott&#x27;s car, detectives Brocchini and Buehler tracked Scott to San Diego. Anticipating Peterson was planning to evade arrest by fleeing to Mexico, the detectives immediately began electronically monitoring Peterson&#x27;s activities, but discovered Peterson had switched vehicles, rendering their GPS locator useless.

==Criminal action==
===Arrest and arraignment===
Police increased their surveillance of Peterson, following his car and monitoring his location by listening to his cell phone calls. Since Peterson had switched vehicles and was less than thirty miles from the Mexican border, detectives were certain Peterson was planning to flee to Mexico. Said Detective Brocchini in a 2017 interview: &quot;We&#x27;ve got to find Scott right now. He told me he was [at Brooks Island] and that&#x27;s where the bodies come (sic) up? I believe it was premeditated, he planned it ... San Diego was pretty darn close to the Mexican border. Scott knew the area pretty well. That&#x27;s where his parents lived. That&#x27;s where he lived. So it wasn&#x27;t like he was going to have to get on MapQuest to figure out a way to get to Tijuana.&quot;

On April 18, 2003, detectives arrested Peterson at Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla as he was meeting his father and brother for a golf game. Peterson had dyed his hair and beard blonde and his vehicle was packed with equipment and supplies, including nearly $15,000 in cash, Viagra tablets, camping and survival equipment, several changes of clothes, four cell phones, and two driver&#x27;s licenses: his and his brother&#x27;s. Lee Peterson, Scott&#x27;s father, explained Scott used his brother&#x27;s license to get a San Diego resident discount at the golf course, and was living in his car to avoid media attention and harassment. Police and prosecutors alleged the switched car, dyed hair, money, phones, driver&#x27;s license, and camping equipment indicated Peterson was trying to disguise himself and flee to Mexico.

Detectives Brocchini and Buehler drove Peterson back to Modesto, where Peterson was booked into the Stanislaus County Jail. On April 21, 2003, Peterson was arraigned in Stanislaus County Superior Court and charged with two felony counts of murder with premeditation and special circumstances, to which he pleaded not guilty. Because of the intense publicity, community involvement, and the small pool of potential jurors in Stanislaus County, Judge Al Girolami moved the trial to San Mateo County to avoid defense accusations of juror bias and ensure Peterson received a fair trial.

===Trial===
Before his arraignment, Peterson had been represented by Kirk McAllister, a veteran criminal defense attorney from Modesto. Chief Deputy Public Defender Kent Faulkner was also assigned to the case. Peterson later indicated that he could afford a private attorney, namely Mark Geragos, who had done other high-profile criminal defense work. Scott&#x27;s trial began on June 1, 2004, and was followed closely by the news media. The lead prosecutor was Rick Distaso and Geragos led Scott&#x27;s defense. Prosecution witness Frey hired her own attorney, Gloria Allred, to represent her.

On June 23, 2004, one of the jurors was dismissed by Judge Alfred Delucchi after Delucchi spent two hours in his chambers questioning each of the jurors. Prior to Delucchi&#x27;s June 21 interview, the aforementioned juror had been recorded on video speaking to Laci&#x27;s brother, Brent Rocha. Delucchi had initially stated that this exchange had not warranted removal. He did not give a reason for the juror&#x27;s later dismissal, although the transcript of Delucchi&#x27;s session with him indicated that the juror had admitted that his girlfriend and others had spoken to him about news reports of his encounter with Rocha. Delucchi furthermore warned the remaining jurors not to read, watch, or listen to media coverage of the trial.

====Opening statements====
In opening statements, the prosecution said they would show that Scott had killed his wife because he was having an affair with Frey. The state chiefly detailed Scott&#x27;s behavior in the days before and after his wife was reported missing, including telling others he had been golfing and asking police if they had used cadaver dogs to investigate the park in which Laci was supposed to have walked their dog. The defense conceded that Scott was &quot;a cad&quot; for cheating on Laci but ridiculed the prosecution&#x27;s theory that Scott was going to &quot;chuck this entire life he had&quot; for a masseuse mistress he had taken on only four dates. Geragos said that the police had rushed to judgment, noting that the police had discredited Scott&#x27;s claim that Laci was watching a segment of &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; on making meringues because, they stated, no meringue was mentioned on that program that morning. 

But Geragos played a tape in court of that day&#x27;s morning episode, which showed that the segment was about baking meringues. Finally, Geragos emphasized the prosecution&#x27;s lack of forensic evidence. He dismissed a hair of Laci&#x27;s found in Scott&#x27;s boat because Laci had visited the boat a few days before her disappearance and could have left it then.

====Evidence====
Lacking direct evidence to link Scott to the crime, prosecutors chiefly relied on circumstantial evidence, pointing, in particular to Scott&#x27;s behavior before, during, and after Laci&#x27;s disappearance. Through various witnesses, the prosecution suggested Scott had several motives for killing Laci—that he was tired of his marriage, that he felt pressure from her pregnancy, that he wanted to continue his affair with Frey, and that he was under mounting financial pressure. Prosecutors claimed Scott strangled Laci before making cement anchors to weigh his wife&#x27;s body down in San Francisco Bay.

Sharon Rocha testified that when she went to East La Loma park to search for Laci, she saw Scott there, but she said Scott did not acknowledge her calling out to him and that he later &quot;angled away&quot; from her attempts to hug him, and failed to attend a candlelight vigil. Two other relatives of Laci said Scott had shown little emotion during Laci&#x27;s disappearance, and three witnesses testified that Scott had told them he had been golfing, not fishing, after Laci&#x27;s disappearance. 
The prosecution called on various witnesses to establish that Scott changed his appearance, purchased a vehicle using his mother&#x27;s name, and added two pornographic television channels to his cable service days after his wife&#x27;s disappearance. A realtor testified that, in January 2003, Scott expressed interest in selling the house he had shared with Laci, saying he did not want her to have to live in the home if she were to be found alive. A car salesman testified that Scott had traded in Laci&#x27;s Land Rover for a Dodge pick-up truck after her disappearance. Frey testified as to her affair with Scott, and the jury heard the secretly recorded telephone calls between the pair; in one, recorded after Laci disappeared, Scott falsely said he was in Paris. As to the Petersons&#x27; financial condition, an auditor testified for the prosecution that the couple had been living beyond their means and accumulated $23,000 in credit-card debt. During cross examination, the auditor also stated that Scott had paid all of his bills on time and had $50,000 of credit available on other cards.

Prosecution witness Rodney Oswalt said that neither of two hair follicles found on Scott&#x27;s boat belonged to Scott, though he said he could not determine whether they belonged to Laci. Karen Korsberg, an FBI trace evidence expert, said she matched one of the hairs to a hair found in Laci&#x27;s hairbrush through mitochondrial DNA tests. The prosecution further suggested that the hair must have come from Laci&#x27;s dead body because she had not seen the boat while alive. Defense lawyers argued that mitochondrial testing was not a reliable means of DNA comparison—only half of states in the U.S. allowed the practice—and further contended that Laci had, in fact, been on the boat while alive. A witness reported that she had seen Laci at the warehouse with the boat the day before she was reported missing. On the stand, Detective Allen Brocchini explained that he had &quot;excised&quot; that witness&#x27;s statement from his police report.

Prosecution witness Robert O&#x27;Neill was asked to comment on Scott&#x27;s claim that he had used a 90-pound bag of cement to make a single anchor and pave his driveway. O&#x27;Neill said that the material in the anchor did not match a sample of concrete from the driveway because the driveway sample featured large, gravel-like chunks. Conversely, for the defense, Steven Gabler, a concrete expert, testified that the samples were consistent. Gabler said that the gravel chunks had adhered to the driveway&#x27;s concrete because the concrete was poured on top of those chunks. Scott&#x27;s defense attorney, Mark Geragos, also pointed out that no such anchors were found after a search of the floor of San Francisco Bay with sonar equipment accurate enough to locate objects as small as a tin can. But Geoffrey Baehr, who helped lead more than 15 diving expeditions off the Berkeley Marina to search for Laci, testified that thick mud, strong currents, dark waters, and a strong surge can make it &quot;virtually impossible&quot; for such equipment to locate an object, even when the target is known, and that this is why they did not find Laci&#x27;s body or any anchors. To emphasize this point, Baehr related that when his crew accidentally dropped the underwater sonar device into the water, it took four diving trips to locate it, even though the crew knew precisely where it had landed.

Rick Cheng, a hydrologist with the United States Geological Survey and an expert witness on tides of the San Francisco Bay, testified as a witness for the prosecution. He suggested that Laci may have been dumped near where Scott had said he was fishing. During cross-examination, Cheng admitted that his findings were &quot;probable, not precise&quot;.

Scott&#x27;s defense lawyers based their case on the lack of direct evidence, and played down the significance of circumstantial evidence. They also questioned whether the investigation was thorough, since Modesto Police Detective Mike Hermos admitted he did not check the alibi of a prostitute who was accused of stealing checks from Scott&#x27;s mailbox. Hermos did not indicate that the woman was ever a suspect, and prosecutor Dave Harris noted that the checks were stolen after Laci vanished, precluding the woman from involvement in her disappearance. A police community-service officer testified that the playback of an interview with Scott had no sound because no batteries had been placed in the tape recorder that was used to record it. Other detectives were called to testify about the extensive search for evidence.

The defense suggested the fetal remains were of a full-term infant and theorized that someone kidnapped Laci, held her until she gave birth and then dumped both bodies in the bay. The prosecution&#x27;s medical experts contended that the fetus was not full-term and died at the same time as his mother. As to this matter, Dr. Charles March, a fertility specialist, was expected to be a crucial witness for the defense. March said that the Petersons&#x27; unborn fetus could not have died any earlier than December 29, 2002. Under cross-examination, March said he had based his finding on a report by one of Laci&#x27;s friends, who said that Laci had told her that a June 9, 2002, at-home pregnancy test had produced a positive reading. But the prosecution criticized March for having relied on a friend&#x27;s report. After prosecutors criticized March for a typo in his report, he remarked, &quot;Cut me some slack.&quot;

====Verdict and sentencing====
One juror was removed and replaced during deliberations due to misconduct, after she conducted independent research on the case. The jury foreman (an attorney) requested his own removal, most likely because his fellow jurors wanted to replace him as foreman. Geragos told reporters that the foreman had mentioned threats he received when he requested to be removed from the jury. The foreman was replaced by an alternate.

On November 12, 2004, the jury convicted Scott of two counts of murder: first-degree murder with special circumstances for killing Laci, and second-degree murder for killing the fetus she carried. The penalty phase of the trial began on November 30, and concluded December 13, when the jury rendered a sentence of death. On March 16, Judge Delucchi followed the jury verdict, sentencing Scott to death by lethal injection and ordering him to pay $10,000 toward the cost of Laci&#x27;s funeral. He described the murder of Laci as &quot;cruel, uncaring, heartless, and callous&quot;.

In later press appearances, members of the jury stated that they believed Scott&#x27;s demeanor—specifically his lack of emotion and the phone calls to Frey in the days following Laci&#x27;s disappearance—indicated his guilt. Juror No. 1, Greg Beratlis, and two other jurors, said they based their verdict on &quot;hundreds of small &#x27;puzzle pieces&#x27; of circumstantial evidence that came out during the trial, from the location of Laci&#x27;s body to the myriad lies her husband told after her disappearance.

On October 21, 2005, a judge ruled that proceeds from a $250,000 life insurance policy Scott took out on Laci would go to Laci&#x27;s mother. This was reaffirmed by the Fifth District Court of Appeal on October 31, 2007.

Scott arrived at San Quentin State Prison in the early morning hours of Thursday, March 17, 2005. He was reported not to have slept the night before, being too &quot;jazzed&quot; to sleep. He joined the more than 700 other inmates in California&#x27;s sole death row facility during the appeals process.

===Appeal and post-conviction action===
====Direct appeal====
Scott&#x27;s automatic appeal of his death sentence was filed in the Supreme Court of California on July 5, 2012. The next day, Scott&#x27;s attorney, Cliff Gardner, filed a 423-page brief contesting the sentence, arguing that the publicity surrounding the trial, incorrect evidentiary rulings, and other mistakes deprived Scott of a fair trial. The State Attorney General&#x27;s office filed their response brief on January 26, 2015. The defense filed a response to the State&#x27;s brief in July 2015, claiming that a certified dog that detected Laci&#x27;s scent at Berkeley Marina had failed two-thirds of tests with similar conditions.

In June 2020, the California Supreme Court heard argument on Scott&#x27;s direct appeal. The defense argued that prospective jurors were improperly excused; that the trial judge improperly allowed two jurors onto Scott&#x27;s boat; that the judge erred in insisting the prosecution be present during defense testing of the boat; and that the motion to move the trial to another county should have been granted due to juror questionnaire results showing almost half of the prospective jurors had already concluded Scott was guilty prior to the trial. The prosecution countered that the California Supreme Court should overturn the verdict only if it were to find that a prospective juror was improperly dismissed, and that &quot;there was &#x27;no credible claim&#x27; that any of the 12 jurors who decided [Scott&#x27;s] fate were unfair or partial.&quot;

On August 24, 2020, in a 7–0 decision, the Supreme Court of California upheld Scott&#x27;s conviction but overturned his death sentence; the court found that Scott&#x27;s trial judge had improperly dismissed jurors who opposed capital punishment without asking them whether they could put their views aside. Justice Leondra Kruger explained that, per Supreme Court rulings since 1968, &quot;Jurors may not be excused merely for opposition to the death penalty, but only for views rendering them unable to fairly consider imposing that penalty in accordance with their oath. This is the meaning of the guarantee of an impartial jury.&quot; Prosecutors initially stated that they would retry the penalty phase, but subsequently reversed that decision in June 2021.

On September 22, 2021, California Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that Scott would be re-sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The following month, Massullo scheduled a hearing on that matter for December 8. On December 8, Massullo re-sentenced Scott to life in prison without the possibility of parole, for the first-degree murder of Laci, and a concurrent sentence of 15 years to life for the second-degree murder of Conner.

In October 2022, Scott was transferred from San Quentin&#x27;s death row to Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California.

====&quot;Habeas&quot; petition====
In November 2015, Scott filed a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition. While the direct appeal could only challenge errors made by the trial judge, Scott&#x27;s &quot;habeas&quot; petition could include new evidence. Among other bases for relief, Scott contended that a juror lied on her jury application and that there was evidence that neighbors saw Laci alive after Scott left home. 

On August 10, 2017, the State Attorney General filed a 150-page response arguing that the &quot;habeas&quot; petition ignored &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that Scott murdered Laci. Supervising Deputy Attorney General Donna Provenzano discounted eyewitness spotting of Laci, saying that such sightings &quot;were legion&quot;, while noting 74 reported sightings in 26 states and overseas, most of which she stated, were neither viable nor corroborated. In August 2018, Scott&#x27;s legal team filed their reply, emphasizing six claims of &quot;deficient performance&quot; by trial attorney Mark Geragos, such as failing to call experts in fetal growth, dog scent, how bodies move in water, stating that he would call witnesses but failing to follow through, and failing to properly address burglary evidence.

In October 2020, the California Supreme Court, in response to the &quot;habeas&quot; petition, issued a show-cause order instructing the lower court to consider the question of juror misconduct.

On December 20, 2022, Judge Massullo denied Scott&#x27;s &quot;habeas&quot; petition, which had been based, in part, on the allegation that a juror committed misconduct when she lied about her own history of domestic abuse during jury selection. Scott&#x27;s appeal said that her history had tainted the jury. Massullo concluded that there was no evidence to support this accusation, explaining that the juror did not intentionally conceal this information with the motive to stay on the jury, nor did she appear vengeful toward Scott in letters she later wrote him in the prison. Massullo wrote, &quot;The Court concludes that Juror No. 7&#x27;s responses were not motivated by pre-existing or improper bias against [Scott], but instead were the result of a combination of good faith misunderstanding of the questions and sloppiness in answering.&quot; Scott still had the legal option of appealing her ruling.

====LA Innocence Project====
On March 12, 2024, Scott attended a status hearing in Redwood City that had been granted by a San Mateo County judge in response to a request by LA Innocence Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization that accepted Peterson&#x27;s case two months prior. The Project said it had new evidence from the trial, which the Project said supported Peterson&#x27;s claims of innocence.

On April 23, the prosecution responded to the new push for DNA testing, describing it as &quot;unnecessary&quot;. He noted that Scott Peterson had lied about the circumstances surrounding his wife&#x27;s murder and that such DNA testing was already done in 2013 and again in 2019. In May 2024, a judge granted Peterson&#x27;s motion to allow DNA testing on one single item of evidence - a piece of duct tape found on Laci&#x27;s pants during her autopsy - while rejecting all other requests for further testing.

On October 7, 2024, a judge granted Peterson&#x27;s request for post-conviction discovery, allowing his defense team to access evidence held by the authorities which they claim was withheld at Peterson&#x27;s trial.

==Burials and tributes==

Laci and Conner, her unborn son, were buried at Burwood Cemetery on August 30, 2003. Their headstone omits the surname Peterson, per the request of Laci&#x27;s mother and stepfather, thus Laci is named under her maiden name of Rocha. The deaths of Laci and Conner Peterson led to the passage of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which is also known as Laci and Conner&#x27;s Law. On April 1, 2004, Sharon Rocha and her husband Ron Grantski were in attendance at the White House when President George W. Bush signed the bill into law. The Act provides that, under federal law, any person who causes death or injury to an unborn child during the commission of a crime upon a pregnant woman will be charged with a separate offense.

On October 21, 2005, Stanislaus County, California, Superior Court Judge Roger Beauchesne ruled that Scott was not entitled to collect on Laci&#x27;s $250,000 life insurance policy, as he had been convicted of her murder. Under California state law, criminals may not profit from insurance policies. On December 19, 2005, the money was given to her mother, Sharon Rocha, as the executor of her estate. The California Fifth District Court of Appeals in Fresno later affirmed the trial court&#x27;s decision on October 31, 2007. A $25 million wrongful death lawsuit was later filed against Scott Peterson by Laci&#x27;s mother and stepfather, but was dropped in April 2009.

In September 2006, former US congressman William E. Dannemeyer (R-CA) sent a letter to the California Attorney General and other officials arguing that Laci had been killed by members of a Satanic cult, not by Scott.

In 2006, Sharon Rocha published &quot;For Laci: A Mother&#x27;s Story of Love, Loss, and Justice&quot;, her biography and memoir about Laci&#x27;s life and death. All proceeds are used to fund the Laci and Conner Search and Rescue Fund, which she had founded. On January 29, 2006, it was listed at No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Non-Fiction Best Seller list.

Laci&#x27;s stepfather, Ron Grantski, died in his sleep at his Modesto home on April 8, 2018, at age 71. This followed a lengthy period of failing health. He was buried next to Laci and Conner in Burwood Cemetery. Laci&#x27;s father, Dennis Rocha, died December 9, 2018, at the age of 72. He was buried in Lakewood Memorial Park.

<text>Joseph Marie, comte de Maistre (1 April 1753 – 26 February 1821) was a Savoyard philosopher, writer, lawyer, diplomat, and magistrate. One of the forefathers of conservatism, Maistre advocated social hierarchy and monarchy in the period immediately following the French Revolution. Despite his close personal and intellectual ties with France, Maistre was throughout his life a subject of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which he served as a member of the Savoy Senate (1787–1792), ambassador to the Russian Empire (1803–1817), and minister of state to the court in Turin (1817–1821).

A key figure of the Counter-Enlightenment and a precursor of Romanticism, Maistre regarded monarchy both as a divinely sanctioned institution and as the only stable form of government. He called for the restoration of the House of Bourbon to the throne of France and for the ultimate authority of the Pope in both spiritual and temporal matters. Maistre argued that the rationalist rejection of Christianity was directly responsible for the Reign of Terror which followed the French Revolution of 1789.

== Biography ==
Maistre was born in 1753 at Chambéry, Duchy of Savoy, at that time part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia which was ruled by the House of Savoy. His family was of French and Italian origin. His grandfather André (Andrea) Maistre (1661–1722), whose parents Francesco and Margarita Maistre (née Dalmassi) originated in the County of Nice, had been a draper and councilman in Nice (then under the rule of the House of Savoy) and his father François-Xavier Maistre (1705–1789), who moved to Chambéry in 1740, became a magistrate and senator, eventually receiving the title of count from the King of Piedmont-Sardinia. His mother&#x27;s family, whose surname was Desmotz, were from Rumilly. He was the eldest of ten surviving children and godfather to his younger brother, Xavier, who would become a major general and a popular writer of fiction.
Maistre was probably educated by the Jesuits. After the Revolution, he became an ardent defender of the Jesuits, increasingly associating the spirit of the Revolution with the Jesuits&#x27; traditional enemies, the Jansenists. After completing his training in the law at the University of Turin in 1774, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a senator in 1787. 

In his early years Maistre was a liberal and supporter of Gallicanism. The philosopher and mystic Louis Claude de Saint-Martin was a major and lasting influence for Maistre. In one of his first public addresses Maistre praised the American Revolution proclaiming &quot;Liberty, insulted in Europe, has winged its flight to another hemisphere.&quot; 

A member of the progressive Scottish Rite Masonic lodge at Chambéry from 1774 to 1790, Maistre originally favoured political reform in France, supporting the efforts of the magistrates in the Parlements to force King Louis XVI to convene the Estates General. As a landowner in France, Maistre was eligible to join that body and there is some evidence that he contemplated that possibility. Maistre was alarmed by the decision of the Estates-General to combine aristocracy, clergy and commoners into a single legislative body which became the National Constituent Assembly. After the passing of the August Decrees on 4 August 1789, he decisively turned against the course of political events in France.

Maistre fled Chambéry when it was taken by a French revolutionary army in 1792, but he was unable to find a position in the royal court in Turin and returned the following year. Deciding that he could not support the French-controlled regime, Maistre departed again, this time for Lausanne, Switzerland, where he discussed politics and theology at the salon of Madame de Staël, and began his career as a counter-revolutionary writer, with works such as &quot;Lettres d&#x27;un Royaliste Savoisien&quot; (&quot;Letters from a Savoyard Royalist&quot;, 1793), &quot;Discours à Mme. la Marquise Costa de Beauregard, sur la Vie et la Mort de son Fils&quot; (&quot;Discourse to the Marchioness Costa de Beauregard, on the Life and Death of her Son&quot;, 1794) and &quot;Cinq paradoxes à la Marquise de Nav...&quot; (&quot;Five Paradoxes for the Marchioness of Nav...&quot;, 1795).

From Lausanne, Maistre went to Venice and then to Cagliari, where the King of Piedmont-Sardinia held the court and the government of the kingdom after French armies took Turin in 1798. Maistre&#x27;s relations with the court at Cagliari were not always easy. In 1802, he was sent to Saint Petersburg in Russia as ambassador to Tsar Alexander I. His diplomatic responsibilities were few and he became a well-loved fixture in aristocratic and wealthy merchant circles, converting some of his friends to Roman Catholicism and writing his most influential works on political philosophy.

Maistre&#x27;s observations on Russian life, contained in his diplomatic memoirs and in his personal correspondence, were among Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s sources for his novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;. After the defeat of Napoleon and the restoration of the House of Savoy&#x27;s dominion over Piedmont and Savoy under the terms of the Congress of Vienna, Maistre returned in 1817 to Turin and served there as magistrate and minister of state until his death. He died on 26 February 1821 and is buried in the Jesuit Church of the Holy Martyrs (&quot;Chiesa dei Santi Martiri&quot;).

== Philosophy ==
=== Politics ===

In (&quot;Considerations on France&quot;, 1796), Maistre claimed that France has a divine mission as the principal instrument of good and evil on Earth. He interpreted the Revolution of 1789 as a providential event in which the monarchy, the aristocracy and the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; in general, instead of directing the influence of French civilization to the benefit of mankind, had promoted the atheistic doctrines of the 18th-century philosophers. He claimed that the crimes of the Reign of Terror were the logical consequence of Enlightenment thought as well as its divinely-decreed punishment.

In his short book &quot;Essai sur le Principe Générateur des Constitutions Politiques et des Autres Institutions Humaines&quot; (&quot;Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions and other Human Institutions&quot;, 1809), Maistre argued that constitutions are not the product of human reason, but rather come from God, who slowly brings them to maturity.

What was novel in Maistre&#x27;s writings was not his enthusiastic defense of monarchical and religious authority &quot;per se&quot;, but rather his arguments concerning the practical need for ultimate authority to lie with an individual capable of decisive action as well as his analysis of the social foundations of that authority&#x27;s legitimacy. In his own words which he addressed to a group of aristocratic French émigrés, &quot;You ought to know how to be royalists. Before, this was an instinct, but today it is a science. You must love the sovereign as you love order, with all the forces of intelligence.&quot; Maistre&#x27;s analysis of the problem of authority and its legitimacy foreshadows some of the concerns of early sociologists such as Auguste Comte and Henri de Saint-Simon.

Despite his preference for monarchy, Maistre acknowledged that republics could be the superior form of government, depending on the situation and the people. Maistre also defended the government of the United States because its people were heirs to the democratic spirit of Great Britain, which he felt France lacked.

=== Religion ===
After the appearance in 1816 of his French translation of Plutarch&#x27;s treatise &quot;On the Delay of Divine Justice in the Punishment of the Guilty&quot;, Maistre published &quot;Du Pape&quot; (&quot;On the Pope&quot;) in 1819, the most complete exposition of his religious conception of authority. According to Maistre, any attempt to justify government on rational grounds will only lead to unresolvable arguments about the legitimacy and expediency of any existing government and that this in turn will lead to violence and chaos. As a result, Maistre argued that the legitimacy of government must be based on compelling, but non-rational grounds which its subjects must not be allowed to question. Maistre went on to argue that authority in politics should derive from religion and that in Europe this religious authority must ultimately lie with the Pope.

=== Ethics ===

In addition to his voluminous correspondence, Maistre left two books that were published posthumously. &quot;Soirées de St. Pétersbourg&quot; (1821) is a theodicy in the form of a Platonic dialogue in which Maistre argues that evil exists because of its place in the divine plan, according to which the blood sacrifice of innocents returns men to God via the expiation of the sins of the guilty. Maistre sees this as a law of human history as unquestionable as it is mysterious.

=== Science ===
&quot;Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon&quot; (&quot;An Examination of the Philosophy of Bacon&quot;, 1836) is a critique of the thought of Francis Bacon, whom Maistre considers to be the fountainhead of the destructive rationalistic thought. Maistre also argued, romantically, that genius plays a pivotal role in great scientific discoveries, as demonstrated by inspired intellects such as Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton, contrary to Bacon&#x27;s theory about conforming to a mechanistic method.

== Personal life ==
Maistre was married to Françoise de Morand de Saint-Sulpice (1759–1839), with whom he had three children—daughters Adèle (1787–1862) and Constance (1793–1882) and son Rudolphe (1789–1866), military officer who fought for the Russian Empire at the battles of Friedland, Smolensk, Moskova (Borodino), Bérézina, Dresde, and Leipzig.

== Legacy and reputation ==

=== Politics ===
Together with the Anglo-Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke, Maistre is commonly regarded as one of the founders of European conservatism. Maistre exerted a powerful influence on the Spanish political thinker Juan Donoso Cortés, the French royalist Charles Maurras and his nationalist movement &quot;Action Française&quot; as well as the German philosopher of law Carl Schmitt.

However, according to Carolina Armenteros, who has written four books about Maistre, his writings influenced not only conservative political thinkers but also the utopian socialists. Early sociologists such as Auguste Comte and Henri de Saint-Simon explicitly acknowledged the influence of Maistre on their own thinking about the sources of social cohesion and political authority.

Maistre has been criticized by classical liberals. Literary critic Émile Faguet described Maistre as &quot;a fierce absolutist, a furious theocrat, an intransigent legitimist, apostle of a monstrous trinity composed of pope, king and hangman, always and everywhere the champion of the hardest, narrowest and most inflexible dogmatism, a dark figure out of the Middle Ages, part learned doctor, part inquisitor, part executioner&quot;. Political historian Isaiah Berlin considered Maistre a forerunner to the 20th-century movement of fascism, claiming that Maistre knew the self-destructive impulses in human nature and intended to exploit them. However, Italian fascism openly rejected Maistre&#x27;s reactionary conservatism.

=== Literature ===
Maistre&#x27;s skills as a writer and polemicist ensured that he continues to be read. Matthew Arnold, an influential 19th-century critic, wrote as follows while comparing Maistre&#x27;s style with that of his Irish counterpart Edmund Burke:

&quot;Joseph de Maistre is another of those men whose word, like that of Burke, has vitality. In imaginative power he is altogether inferior to Burke. On the other hand, his thought moves in closer order than Burke&#x27;s, more rapidly, more directly; he has fewer superfluities. Burke is a great writer, but Joseph de Maistre&#x27;s use of the French language is more powerful, more thoroughly satisfactory, than Burke&#x27;s use of the English. It is masterly; it shows us to perfection of what that admirable instrument, the French language, is capable.&quot;

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1910 describes his writing style as &quot;strong, lively, picturesque&quot; and states that his &quot;animation and good humour temper his dogmatic tone&quot;. George Saintsbury called him &quot;unquestionably one of the greatest thinkers and writers of the eighteenth century&quot;. Although a political opponent, Alphonse de Lamartine called him the &quot;Plato of the Alps&quot;. Admiring the splendour of his prose, Lamartine stated:

Maistre is also associated with the Counter-Enlightenment movement Romanticism and is often referred to as a Romantic. Among those who admired him was Charles Baudelaire – the most famous Romantic poet in France – who described himself a disciple of the Savoyard counter-revolutionary, claiming that Maistre had taught him how to think.

<text>Philip Henry Sheridan (March 6, 1831 – August 5, 1888) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. His career was noted for his rapid rise to major general and his close association with General-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant, who transferred Sheridan from command of an infantry division in the Western Theater to lead the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the East. In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces under General Jubal Early in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called &quot;The Burning&quot; by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched-earth tactics in the war. In 1865, his cavalry pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee and was instrumental in forcing his surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.

In his later years, Sheridan fought in the Indian Wars against Native American tribes of the Great Plains. He was instrumental in the development and protection of Yellowstone National Park, both as a soldier and a private citizen. In 1883, Sheridan was appointed general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, and in 1888 he was promoted to the rank of General of the Army during the term of President Grover Cleveland.

==Early life and education==

Sheridan was born in Albany, New York, on March 6, 1831, the third of six children of John and Mary Meenagh Sheridan, Irish Catholic immigrants from Killinkere parish in County Cavan, Ireland. He grew up in Somerset, Ohio. Small in stature, he reached only 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm) tall, earning him the nickname, &quot;Little Phil.&quot; Abraham Lincoln described his appearance in a famous anecdote: &quot;A brown, chunky little chap, with a long body, short legs, not enough neck to hang him, and such long arms that if his ankles itch he can scratch them without stooping.&quot;

As a boy, Sheridan worked in a general store and later as head clerk and bookkeeper at a dry goods store. In 1848, he obtained an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, from a nomination from one of his customers, U.S. Congressman Thomas Ritchey, whose first candidate was disqualified after failing a mathematics examination and reportedly displayed a &quot;poor attitude.&quot; In his fourth year at West Point, Sheridan was suspended for a year for fighting with classmate William R. Terrill. The previous day, Sheridan had threatened to run him through with a fixed bayonet in reaction to a perceived insult on the parade ground. He graduated in 1853, 34th in his class of 52 cadets.

Sheridan was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant and was assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry Regiment at Fort Duncan in Eagle Pass, Texas, then to the 4th U.S. Infantry Regiment at Fort Reading in Anderson, California. Most of his service with the 4th Infantry was in the Pacific Northwest, starting with a topographical survey mission to the Willamette Valley in 1855, during which he became involved with the Yakima War and Rogue River Wars, gaining experience in leading small combat team and some diplomatic skills in his negotiations with Indian tribes. On March 28, 1857, he was wounded when a bullet grazed his nose at Middle Cascade, Oregon Territory. He and an Indian woman from Rogue River lived together during part of his tour of duty. Named Frances by her white friends, she was the daughter of Takelma Chief Harney.

In March 1861, just before the beginning the American Civil War, Sheridan was promoted to first lieutenant, and then to captain in May, just weeks after the war commenced following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter.

==Civil War==

===Western Theater===
In the fall of 1861, Sheridan was ordered to travel to Jefferson Barracks, near St. Louis, Missouri, for assignment to the 13th U.S. Infantry. He departed from his command of Fort Yamhill in Oregon by way of San Francisco, across the Isthmus of Panama, and through New York City to home in Somerset for a brief leave. On the way to his new post, he made a courtesy call to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck in St. Louis, who commandeered his services to audit the financial records of his immediate predecessor, Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, whose administration of the Department of the Missouri was tainted by charges of wasteful expenditures and fraud that left the status of $12 million in debt. Sheridan sorted out the mess, impressing Halleck in the process. Much to Sheridan&#x27;s dismay, Halleck&#x27;s vision for Sheridan consisted of a continuing role as a staff officer. Nevertheless, Sheridan performed the task assigned to him and entrenched himself as an excellent staff officer in Halleck&#x27;s view.

In December, Sheridan was appointed chief commissary officer of the Army of Southwest Missouri, but convinced the department commander, Halleck, to also give him the position of quartermaster general. In January 1862, he reported for duty to Maj. Gen. Samuel Curtis and served under him at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Sheridan soon discovered that officers were engaged in profiteering, including stealing horses from civilians and demanding payment from Sheridan. He refused to pay for the stolen property and confiscated the horses for the use of Curtis&#x27;s army. When Curtis ordered him to pay the officers, Sheridan brusquely responded, &quot;No authority can compel me to jayhawk or steal.&quot; Curtis had Sheridan arrested for insubordination but Halleck&#x27;s influence appears to have ended any formal proceedings. Sheridan performed aptly in his role under Curtis, and then returned to Halleck&#x27;s headquarters to accompany the army on the Siege of Corinth and serve as an assistant to the department&#x27;s topographical engineer. He made the acquaintance of Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman, who offered him the role of colonel in an Ohio infantry regiment. The appointment fell through, but Sheridan was subsequently aided by friends, including future Secretary of War Russell A. Alger, who petitioned Michigan Governor Austin Blair on his behalf. Sheridan was appointed colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry on May 27, 1862, despite having no experience in the mounted arm.
A month later, Sheridan commanded his first forces in combat, leading a small brigade that included his regiment. At the Battle of Booneville, Mississippi, July 1, 1862, he held back several regiments of Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers&#x27;s Confederate cavalry, deflected a large flanking attack with a noisy diversion, and reported critical intelligence about enemy dispositions. His actions so impressed the division commanders, including Brig. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, that they recommended Sheridan&#x27;s promotion to brigadier general. They wrote to Halleck, &quot;Brigadiers scarce; good ones scarce. ... The undersigned respectfully beg that you will obtain the promotion of Sheridan. He is worth his weight in gold.&quot; The promotion was approved in September, but dated effective July 1 as a reward for his actions at Booneville. After Booneville, one of his fellow officers gave him the horse that he named Rienzi after the skirmish of Rienzi, Mississippi, which he rode throughout the Civil War.

Sheridan was assigned to command the 11th Division, III Corps, in Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio. On October 8, 1862, Sheridan led his division in the Battle of Perryville. Under orders from Buell and his corps commander, Maj. Gen. Charles Gilbert, Sheridan sent Col. Daniel McCook&#x27;s brigade to secure a water supply for the army. McCook drove off the Confederates and secured water for the parched Union troops at Doctor&#x27;s Creek. Gilbert ordered McCook not to advance any further and then rode to consult with Buell. Along the way, Gilbert ordered his cavalry to attack the Confederates in Dan McCook&#x27;s front. Sheridan heard the gunfire and came to the front with another brigade. Although the cavalry failed to secure the heights in front of McCook, Sheridan&#x27;s reinforcements drove off the Southerners. Gilbert returned and ordered Sheridan to return to McCook&#x27;s original position. Sheridan&#x27;s aggressiveness convinced the opposing Confederates under Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, that they should remain on the defensive. His troops repelled Confederate attacks later that day, but did not participate in the heaviest fighting of the day, which occurred on the Union left.
On December 31, 1862, the first day of the Battle of Stones River, Sheridan anticipated a Confederate assault and positioned his division in preparation for it. His division held back the Confederate onslaught on his front until their ammunition ran out and they were forced to withdraw. This action was instrumental in giving the Union army time to rally at a strong defensive position. For his actions, he was promoted to major general on April 10, 1863 (with date of rank December 31, 1862). In six months, he had risen from captain to major general.

The Army of the Cumberland recovered from the shock of Stones River and prepared for its summer offensive against Confederate General Braxton Bragg. Sheridan&#x27;s division participated in the advance against Bragg in Rosecrans&#x27;s brilliant Tullahoma Campaign, and was the lead division to enter the town of Tullahoma. On the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga, September 20, 1863, Rosecrans was shifting Sheridan&#x27;s division behind the Union battle line when Bragg launched an attack into a gap in the Union line. Sheridan&#x27;s division made a gallant stand on Lytle Hill against an attack by the Confederate corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, but was swamped by retreating Union soldiers. The Confederates drove Sheridan&#x27;s division from the field in confusion. He gathered as many men as he could and withdrew toward Chattanooga, rallying troops along the way. Learning of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas&#x27;s XIV Corps stand on Snodgrass Hill, Sheridan ordered his division back to the fighting, but they took a circuitous route and did not participate in the fighting as some histories claim. His return to the battlefield ensured that he did not suffer the fate of Rosecrans who was falsely accused of riding off to Chattanooga leaving the army to its fate, and was soon relieved of command.

During the Battle of Chattanooga, at Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863, Sheridan&#x27;s division and others in George Thomas&#x27;s army broke through the Confederate lines in a wild charge that exceeded the orders and expectations of Thomas and Ulysses S. Grant. Just before his men stepped off, Sheridan told them, &quot;Remember Chickamauga,&quot; and many shouted its name as they advanced as ordered to a line of rifle pits in their front. Faced with enemy fire from above, however, they continued up the ridge. Sheridan spotted a group of Confederate officers outlined against the crest of the ridge and shouted, &quot;Here&#x27;s at you!&quot; An exploding shell sprayed him with dirt and he responded, &quot;That&#x27;s damn ungenerous! I shall take those guns for that!&quot; The Union charge broke through the Confederate lines on the ridge and Bragg&#x27;s army fell into retreat. Sheridan impulsively ordered his men to pursue Bragg to the Confederate supply depot at Chickamauga Station, but called them back when he realized that his was the only command so far forward. General Grant reported after the battle, &quot;To Sheridan&#x27;s prompt movement, the Army of the Cumberland and the nation are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners, artillery, and small arms that day. Except for his prompt pursuit, so much in this way would not have been accomplished.&quot;

===Overland Campaign===

Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, newly promoted to be general-in-chief of all the Union armies, summoned Sheridan to the Eastern Theater to command the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Unbeknownst to Sheridan, he was actually Grant&#x27;s second choice, after Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, but Grant agreed to a suggestion about Sheridan from Chief of Staff Henry W. Halleck. After the war, and in his memoirs, Grant claimed that Sheridan was the very man he wanted for the job. Sheridan arrived at the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac on April 5, 1864, less than a month before the start of Grant&#x27;s massive Overland Campaign against Robert E. Lee.

In the early battles of the campaign, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry was relegated by army commander Maj. Gen. George Meade to its traditional role, including screening, reconnaissance, and guarding trains and rear areas, much to Sheridan&#x27;s frustration. In the Battle of the Wilderness (May 5–6, 1864), the dense forested terrain prevented any significant cavalry role. As the army swung around the Confederate right flank in the direction of Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan&#x27;s troopers failed to clear the road from the Wilderness, losing engagements along the Plank Road on May 5 and Todd&#x27;s Tavern on May 6 through May 8, allowing the Confederates to seize the critical crossroads before the Union infantry could arrive.

When Meade quarreled with Sheridan for not performing his duties of screening and reconnaissance as ordered, Sheridan told Meade that he could &quot;whip Stuart&quot; if Meade let him. Meade reported the conversation to Grant, who replied, &quot;Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it.&quot; Meade deferred to Grant&#x27;s judgment and issued orders to Sheridan to &quot;proceed against the enemy&#x27;s cavalry&quot; and from May 9 through May 24, sent him on a raid toward Richmond, directly challenging the Confederate cavalry. The raid was less successful than hoped; although his raid managed to mortally wound Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at Yellow Tavern on May 11 and beat Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge on May 12, the raid never seriously threatened Richmond and it left Grant without cavalry intelligence for Spotsylvania and North Anna. Historian Gordon C. Rhea wrote, &quot;By taking his cavalry from Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan severely handicapped Grant in his battles against Lee. The Union Army was deprived of his eyes and ears during a critical juncture in the campaign. And Sheridan&#x27;s decision to advance boldly to the Richmond defenses smacked of unnecessary showboating that jeopardized his command.&quot;
Rejoining the Army of the Potomac, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry fought inconclusively at Haw&#x27;s Shop (May 28), a battle with heavy casualties that allowed the Confederate cavalry to obtain valuable intelligence about Union dispositions. They seized the critical crossroads that triggered the Battle of Cold Harbor (June 1 to 12) and withstood a number of assaults until reinforced. Grant then ordered Sheridan on a raid to the northwest to break the Virginia Central Railroad and to link up with the Shenandoah Valley army of Maj. Gen. David Hunter. He was intercepted by the Confederate cavalry under Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton at the Battle of Trevilian Station (June 11–12), where in the largest all-cavalry battle of the war, he achieved tactical success on the first day, but suffered heavy casualties during multiple assaults on the second. He withdrew without achieving his assigned objectives. On his return march, he once again encountered the Confederate cavalry at Samaria (St. Mary&#x27;s) Church on June 24, where his men suffered significant casualties, but successfully protected the Union supply wagons they were escorting.

History draws decidedly mixed opinions on the success of Sheridan in the Overland Campaign, in no small part because the very clear Union victory at Yellow Tavern, highlighted by the death of Jeb Stuart, tends to overshadow other actions and battles. In Sheridan&#x27;s report of the Cavalry Corps&#x27; actions in the campaign, discussing the strategy of cavalry fighting cavalry, he wrote, &quot;The result was constant success and the almost total annihilation of the rebel cavalry. We marched when and where we pleased; we were always the attacking party, and always successful.&quot; A contrary view has been published by historian Eric J. Wittenberg, who notes that of four major strategic raids (Richmond, Trevilian, Wilson-Kautz, and First Deep Bottom) and thirteen major cavalry engagements of the Overland and Richmond–Petersburg campaigns, only Yellow Tavern can be considered a Union victory, with Haw&#x27;s Shop, Trevilian Station, Meadow Bridge, Samaria Church, and Wilson-Kautz defeats in which some of Sheridan&#x27;s forces barely avoided destruction.

===Army of the Shenandoah===

Throughout the war, the Confederacy sent armies out of Virginia through the Shenandoah Valley to invade Maryland and Pennsylvania and threaten Washington, D.C. Lt. Gen. Jubal Early, following the same pattern in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, and hoping to distract Grant from the Siege of Petersburg, attacked Union forces near Washington and raided several towns in Pennsylvania. Grant, reacting to the political commotion caused by the invasion, organized the Middle Military Division, whose field troops were known as the Army of the Shenandoah. He considered various candidates for command, including George Meade, William B. Franklin, and David Hunter, with the latter two intended for the military division while Sheridan would command the army. All of these choices were rejected by either Grant or the War Department and, over the objection of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who believed him to be too young for such a high post, Sheridan took command in both roles at Harpers Ferry on August 7, 1864. His mission was not only to defeat Early&#x27;s army and to close off the Northern invasion route, but to deny the Shenandoah Valley as a productive agricultural region to the Confederacy. Grant told Sheridan, &quot;The people should be informed that so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences of these raids must be expected, and we are determined to stop them at all hazards. ... Give the enemy no rest ... Do all the damage to railroads and crops you can. Carry off stock of all descriptions, and negroes, so as to prevent further planting. If the war is to last another year, we want the Shenandoah Valley to remain a barren waste.&quot;
Sheridan got off to a slow start, needing time to organize and to react to reinforcements reaching Early; Grant ordered him not to launch an offensive &quot;with the advantage against you.&quot; And yet Grant expressed frustration with Sheridan&#x27;s lack of progress. The armies remained unengaged for over a month, causing political consternation in the North as the 1864 election drew near. The two generals conferred on September 16 at Charles Town and agreed that Sheridan would begin his attacks within four days.

On September 19, armed with intelligence about the dispositions and strength of Early&#x27;s forces around Winchester provided by unionist sympathizer and Quaker teacher Rebecca Wright, Sheridan beat Early&#x27;s much smaller army at Third Winchester and followed up on September 22 with a victory at Fisher&#x27;s Hill. As Early attempted to regroup, Sheridan began the punitive operations of his mission, sending his cavalry as far south as Waynesboro to seize or destroy livestock and provisions, and to burn barns, mills, factories, and railroads. Sheridan&#x27;s men did their work relentlessly and thoroughly, rendering over 400 square miles uninhabitable. 

The destruction presaged the scorched-earth tactics of Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea through Georgia, and were designed to deny the Confederacy an army base from which to operate and bring the effects of war home to the population supporting it. Residents referred to this widespread destruction as &quot;The Burning,&quot; which remain controversial. Sheridan&#x27;s troops told of the wanton attack in their letters home, calling themselves &quot;barn burners&quot; and &quot;destroyers of homes.&quot; One soldier wrote to his family that he had personally set 60 private homes on fire and believed that &quot;it was a hard looking sight to see the women and children turned out of doors at this season of the year&quot; (winter). A Sergeant William T. Patterson wrote that &quot;the whole country around is wrapped in flames, the heavens are aglow with the light thereof ... such mourning, such lamentations, such crying and pleading for mercy [by defenseless women] ... I never saw or want to see again.&quot; The Confederates were not idle during this period and Sheridan&#x27;s men were plagued by guerrilla raids by partisan ranger Col. John S. Mosby.

Although Sheridan assumed that Jubal Early was effectively out of action and he considered withdrawing his army to rejoin Grant at Petersburg, Early received reinforcements and, on October 19 at Cedar Creek, launched a well-executed surprise attack while Sheridan was absent from his army, ten miles away at Winchester. Hearing the distant sounds of artillery, he rode aggressively to his command. He reached the battlefield about 10:30 a.m. and began to rally his men. Fortunately for Sheridan, Early&#x27;s men were too occupied to take notice; they were hungry and exhausted and fell out to pillage the Union camps. Sheridan&#x27;s actions are generally credited with saving the day, although Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright, commanding Sheridan&#x27;s VI Corps, already rallied his men and stopped their retreat. Early had been dealt his most significant defeat, rendering his army almost incapable of future offensive action. 

Sheridan received a personal letter of thanks from Abraham Lincoln and was promoted to major general in the regular army as of November 8, 1864, making him the fourth ranking general in the Army, after Grant, Sherman, and Meade. Grant wrote to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton after he ordered a 100-gun salute to celebrate Sheridan&#x27;s victory at Cedar Creek, &quot;Turning what bid fair to be a disaster into glorious victory stamps Sheridan, what I have always thought him, one of the ablest of generals.&quot; A famous poem, &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Ride&quot;, was written by Thomas Buchanan Read to commemorate the general&#x27;s return to the battle. Sheridan reveled in the fame that Read&#x27;s poem brought him, renaming his horse Rienzi to &quot;Winchester,&quot; based on the poem&#x27;s refrain, &quot;Winchester, twenty miles away.&quot; The poem was widely used in Republican campaign efforts and some have credited Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s margin of victory to it. Lincoln was pleased at Sheridan&#x27;s performance as a commander, writing Sheridan and playfully confessing his reassessment of the relatively short officer, &quot;When this peculiar war began, I thought a cavalryman should be six feet four inches, but I have changed my mind. Five foot four will do in a pinch.&quot;

Sheridan spent the next several months occupying Winchester, and was the national military governor of the city after the previous six-month long occupation of his predecessor, national general Robert H. Milroy. He was occupied with light skirmishing and fighting guerrillas. Although Grant continued his exhortations for Sheridan to move south and break the Virginia Central Railroad supplying Petersburg, Sheridan resisted. Wright&#x27;s VI Corps returned to join Grant in November. Sheridan&#x27;s remaining men, primarily cavalry and artillery, finally moved out of their winter quarters on February 27, 1865, and headed east.

Writing about Sheridan&#x27;s occupation of Winchester, a resident wrote:

The orders from Gen. Grant were largely discretionary, interpreted as permitting Sheridan to either destroy the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River Canal, capture Lynchburg if practical, and then either join William T. Sherman in North Carolina or return to Winchester.

===Appomattox Campaign===
Sheridan interpreted Grant&#x27;s orders liberally and instead of heading to North Carolina, in March 1865, he moved to rejoin the Army of the Potomac at Petersburg. He wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Feeling that the war was nearing its end, I desired my cavalry to be in at the death.&quot; His finest service of the Civil War was demonstrated during his relentless pursuit of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army, effectively managing the most crucial aspects of the Appomattox Campaign for Grant.

On the way to Petersburg, at the Battle of Waynesboro, on March 2, 1865, he trapped the remainder of Early&#x27;s army. and 1,500 soldiers surrendered. On April 1, he cut off General Lee&#x27;s lines of support at Five Forks, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg. During the battle, he ruined the military career of Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren by removing him from command of the V Corps under circumstances that a court of inquiry later determined were unjustified. President Rutherford B. Hayes ordered a court of inquiry that convened in 1879 and, after hearing testimony from dozens of witnesses over 100 days, found that Sheridan&#x27;s relief of Warren had been unjustified. Unfortunately for Warren, these results were not published until after his death.

Sheridan&#x27;s aggressive and well-executed performance at the Battle of Sayler&#x27;s Creek on April 6 effectively sealed the fate of Lee&#x27;s army, capturing over 20% of his remaining men. President Lincoln sent Grant a telegram on April 7: &quot;Gen. Sheridan says &#x27;If the thing is pressed I think that Lee will surrender.&#x27; Let the thing be pressed.&quot; At Appomattox Court House, on April 9, 1865, Sheridan blocked Lee&#x27;s escape, forcing the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia later that day. Grant summed up Little Phil&#x27;s performance in these final days, saying, &quot;I believe General Sheridan has no superior as a general, either living or dead, and perhaps not an equal.&quot;

==Reconstruction==
After Gen. Lee&#x27;s surrender, and that of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina, the only significant Confederate field force remaining was in Texas under Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Sheridan was supposed to lead troops in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C., but Grant appointed him commander of the Military District of the Southwest on May 17, 1865 six days before the parade, with orders to defeat Smith without delay and restore Texas and Louisiana to Union control. However, Smith surrendered before Sheridan reached New Orleans.

Grant was also concerned about the situation in neighboring Mexico, where 40,000 French soldiers propped up the puppet regime of Austrian Archduke Maximilian. He gave Sheridan permission to gather a large Texas occupation force. Sheridan assembled 50,000 men in three corps, quickly occupied Texas coastal cities, spread inland, and began to patrol the Mexico–United States border. The Army&#x27;s presence, U.S. political pressure, and the growing resistance of Benito Juárez induced the French to abandon their claims against Mexico. Napoleon III announced a staged withdrawal of French troops to be completed in November 1867. In light of growing opposition at home and concern with the rise of German military prowess, Napoleon III stepped up the French withdrawal, which was completed by March 12, 1867. By June 19 of that year, Mexico&#x27;s republican army had captured, tried, and executed Maximilian. Sheridan later admitted in his memoirs that he had supplied arms and ammunition to Juárez&#x27;s forces: &quot;... which we left at convenient places on our side of the river to fall into their hands&quot;.

On July 30, 1866, while Sheridan was in Texas, a white mob broke up the state constitutional convention in New Orleans, killing 34 blacks. Shortly after Sheridan returned, he wired Grant, &quot;The more information I obtain of the affair of the 30th in this city the more revolting it becomes. It was no riot; it was an absolute massacre.&quot; In March 1867, with Reconstruction barely started, Sheridan was appointed military governor of the Fifth Military District (Texas and Louisiana). He severely limited voter registration for former Confederates and ruled that only registered voters, including black men, were eligible to serve on juries. Furthermore, an inquiry into the deadly New Orleans riot of 1866 implicated numerous local officials; Sheridan dismissed the mayor of New Orleans, the Louisiana attorney general, and a district judge. Following widespread anti-segregation protests in New Orleans, railroad company leaders met with Sheridan to try to get him to support their efforts to maintain the segregated &quot;star car&quot; system. He rejected their requests, thereby forcing them to desegregate New Orleans street cars. He later removed Louisiana Governor James M. Wells, accusing him of being &quot;a political trickster and a dishonest man&quot;. He also dismissed Texas Governor James W. Throckmorton, a former Confederate, for being an &quot;impediment to the reconstruction of the State&quot;, replacing him with the Republican who had lost to him in the previous election Elisha M. Pease. Sheridan had been feuding with President Andrew Johnson for months over interpretations of the Military Reconstruction Acts and voting rights issues, and within a month of the second firing, the president removed Sheridan, stating to an outraged Gen. Grant that, &quot;His rule has, in fact, been one of absolute tyranny, without references to the principles of our government or the nature of our free institutions.&quot;

Sheridan was not popular in Texas, and he did not have much appreciation for Texas, either. In 1866, he quipped that, &quot;If I owned Texas and Hell, I would rent Texas and live in Hell.&quot;
During the Grant administration, while Sheridan was assigned to duty in the West, he was sent to Louisiana on two additional occasions to deal with problems that lingered in Reconstruction. In January 1875, federal troops intervened in the Louisiana Legislature following attempts by the Democrats to seize control of disputed seats. Sheridan supported Republican governor William P. Kellogg, who won the 1872 gubernatorial election, and declared that the Democratic opponents of the Republican regime who used violence to overcome legitimate electoral results were &quot;banditti&quot; who should be subjected to military tribunals and loss of their habeas corpus rights. The Grant administration backed down after an enormous public outcry. A headline in the &quot;New York World&quot; shrieked, &quot;Tyranny! A Sovereign State Murdered!&quot; In 1876, Sheridan was sent to New Orleans to command troops keeping the peace in the aftermath of the disputed 1876 presidential election.

==Indian Wars==

In September 1866, Sheridan was assigned to Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg, Texas, to administer the formerly Confederate area. While there, he spent three months subduing marauding Indians in the Texas Hill Country.

At this time, President Johnson was dissatisfied with the way Republican Army Generals were administering Reconstruction in the post-war Southern states and sought to replace them with Democratic ones more in tune with the (formerly Confederate) White populations committed to instituting Jim Crow laws.

Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock had been assigned to the Department of the Missouri, an administrative area of over 1,000,000 square miles, encompassing land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, and from Kansas north, but had mishandled his campaign mistreating the Plains Indians, primarily Sioux and Cheyenne, resulting in retaliatorily raids that attacked mail coaches, burned stations, and killed employees. The Indians also killed and kidnapped a considerable number of settlers on the frontier. In response to state and territorial governors wanting both more competent Army administration and the Indian uprisings suppressed, coupled with pressures from President Johnson to replace Southern Republican administrators, General Grant swapped Hancock and Sheridan, sending the Democratic Hancock to the Texas post-Confederate area, where he immediately ingratiated himself with the local white population by instituting repressive policies favored by President Johnson&#x27;s administration and other Democratic politicians throughout the Southern territory.

At the same time, Sheridan took up his responsibilities in the Department of the Missouri. According to the Kansas Historical Society:

&quot;President Ulysses S. Grant wanted Sheridan to pacify the Plains Indians, primarily [in response to] the mishandling of the white/Indian conflict by such notables as Major John Chivington and General Winfield Scott Hancock. ... Sheridan&#x27;s ultimate goal was to make the Indians give up their traditional way of life and settle on reservations.  His tactic, though bordering on the barbaric, worked.&quot;

While Sheridan moved into the Plains area, his troops, supplemented with state militias, were spread too thin to have any real effect on the Indian raids so he conceived a strategy of forced deprivation, similar to the one he used in the Shenandoah Valley. In the Winter Campaign of 1868–69 (of which the Battle of Washita River was part) he attacked the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes in their winter quarters, taking their supplies and livestock, driving the Indians back on to their reservations, and killing those who resisted. When Sherman was promoted to General of the Army following Grant&#x27;s election as President of the United States, Sheridan was appointed to senior command of the Military Division of the Missouri, with all the Great Plains under his command. Professional hunters, trespassing on Indian reservations, killed over 4 million bison by 1874. As historian Dan Flores has shown, any quotations attributed to Sheridan that celebrate buffalo hunting or that he ever appeared before the Texas legislature about this matter, are almost certainly apocryphal. As Flores notes, &quot;there is no evidence the nineteenth-century Texas legislature ever considered a bill to outlaw or regulate the hide hunt.&quot; These erroneous charges against Sheridan first surfaced in the 1907 memoir of buffalo hunter John Cook.

Eventually the Indians returned to their designated reservations. Sheridan&#x27;s department conducted the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876–77, which resulted in the death of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The Indian raids subsided during the 1870s and were almost over by the early 1880s, as Sheridan became the commanding general of the entire U.S. Army.

In a story that is almost certainly fictitious, Comanche Chief Tosawi was said to have told Sheridan in 1869, &quot;Tosawi, good Indian,&quot; to which Sheridan is said to have replied, &quot;The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.&quot; In the first printed reference to this exchange, more than 100 years later in 1970, in &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, author Dee Brown attributes the quote to Sheridan, claiming that &quot;Lieutenant Charles Nordstrom, who was present, remembered the words and passed them on, until in time they were honed into an American aphorism: &quot;The only good Indian is a dead Indian&quot;. Sheridan denied he had ever made the statement. Biographer Roy Morris Jr. states that, nevertheless, popular history credits Sheridan with saying &quot;The only good Indian is a dead Indian.&quot; This variation &quot;has been used by friends and enemies ever since to characterize and castigate his Indian-fighting career.&quot;

According to the Kansas Historical Society:

&quot;Sheridan has been accused of being unnecessarily cruel; bent on exterminating the Indian. Although he did regard the Indians as &quot;savages&quot; whose one profession was &quot;that of arms,&quot; he felt that it would take more than just confining them to reservations to settle the west. It would also be necessary to &quot;exercise some strong authority over him.&quot; Although not as sympathetic to the Indians&#x27; plight as some other army officers, he did say that, &quot;We took away their country and their means of support…and against this they made war. Could anyone expect less?&quot; He did agree, however, with most soldiers when he blamed the government for the failure of the reservation system. He said it was up to Congress, &quot;to furnish the poor people from whom this country has been taken with sufficient food to enable them to live without suffering the pangs of hunger.&quot; This is hardly the attitude one would expect from someone who was purported to say, &quot;The only good Indian is a dead Indian,&quot; ... He was above all else, a soldier and in response to some of his critics he stated, &quot;My duties are to protect these people. I have nothing to do with Indians but in this connection…The wife of a man at the center of wealth and civilization and refinement is not more dear to him than is the wife of the pioneer of the frontier. I have no hesitation in making my choice. I am going to stand by the people over whom I am placed and give them what protection I can.&quot;

==Postwar career==
Sheridan was promoted to lieutenant general on March 4, 1869. In 1870, President Grant, at Sheridan&#x27;s request, sent him to observe and report on the Franco-Prussian War. As a guest of King Wilhelm I of Prussia, he was present when Emperor Napoléon III surrendered to the Germans, which was gratifying to Sheridan following his experiences with the French in Mexico. He later toured most of Europe and returned to the U.S. to report to Grant that although the Prussians were &quot;very good brave fellows [who] had gone into each battle with the determination to win, ... there is nothing to be learned here professionally.&quot; He criticized their handling of cavalry and likened their practices to the manner in which Meade had attempted to supervise him. However, he referred to theirs as a &quot;perfect military system&quot; and had a high opinion of the officer corps. His words on the French were much more harsh; he criticized the French army for not taking numerous opportunities to halt the German advance, for advancing slowly and clumsily themselves, for not taking any of the numerous good opportunities to cut the enemy&#x27;s unguarded lines of communication, and for being routed frequently. He remarked: &quot;I am disgusted; all my boyhood&#x27;s fancies of the soldiers of the great Napoleon have been dissipated, or else the soldiers of the &quot;Little Corporal&quot; have lost their elan in the pampered parade soldiers of the &#x27;Man of Destiny&#x27;.&quot;

In 1871, Sheridan was present in Chicago during the Great Chicago Fire and coordinated military relief efforts. The mayor, Roswell B. Mason, to calm the panic, placed the city under martial law, and issued a proclamation putting Sheridan in charge. As there were no widespread disturbances, martial law was lifted within a few days. Although Sheridan&#x27;s personal residence was spared, all of his professional and personal papers were destroyed. When Chicago&#x27;s Washington Park Race Track organized the American Derby in 1883 he served as its first president.

On November 1, 1883, Sheridan succeeded General William T. Sherman as Commanding General of the U.S. Army, and held that position until his death. He was promoted on June 1, 1888, shortly before his death, to the rank of General in the Regular Army (the rank was titled &quot;General of the Army of the United States&quot;, by Act of Congress June 1, 1888, the same rank held earlier by Grant and Sherman, which is equivalent to a five-star general, O-11, in the modern U.S. Army).

Sheridan served as commander in chief of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS), a military society of officers who served in the Union armed forces and their descendants, from 1886 until his death in 1888. He was also the first president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac when it was founded in 1869 and as the ninth president of the National Rifle Association of America in 1885.

==Yellowstone==

The protection of the Yellowstone area was Sheridan&#x27;s personal crusade. He authorized Lieutenant Gustavus Doane to escort the Washburn Expedition in 1870 and for Major John W. Barlow to escort the Hayden Expedition in 1871. Barlow named Mount Sheridan, a peak overlooking Heart Lake in Yellowstone, for the general in 1871. As early as 1875, Sheridan promoted military control of the area to prevent the destruction of natural formations and wildlife.

In 1882, the Department of the Interior granted rights to the Yellowstone Park Improvement Company to develop in the park. Their plan was to build a railroad into the park and sell the land to developers. Sheridan personally organized opposition to the plan and lobbied Congress for protection of the park; including expansion, military control, reducing the development to , and prohibiting leases near park attractions. In addition, he arranged an expedition to the park for President Chester A. Arthur and other influential men. His lobbying soon paid off. A rider was added to the Sundry Civil Bill of 1883, giving Sheridan and his supporters almost everything for which they had asked. In 1886, after a string of ineffectual and sometimes criminal superintendents, Sheridan ordered the 1st U.S. Cavalry into the park. The military operated the park until the National Park Service took it over in 1916.

Sheridan is mentioned favorably in &quot;The National Parks: America&#x27;s Best Idea&quot;, Episode I, for his work saving Yellowstone National Park:

==Personal life==

On June 3, 1875, Sheridan married Irene Rucker, a daughter of Army Quartermaster General Daniel H. Rucker. She was 22, and he was 44. They had four children: Mary, born in 1876; twin daughters, Irene and Louise, in 1877; and Philip Jr., in 1880. After the wedding, Sheridan and his wife moved to Washington, D.C. They lived in a house given to them by Chicago citizens in appreciation for Sheridan&#x27;s protection of the city after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. Philip Sheridan Jr. was an army officer who attained the rank of major and was the husband of Isabel McGunnegle. Isabel McGunnegle was the daughter of army officer George K. McGunnegle.

==Death and burial==
In 1888 Sheridan suffered a series of massive heart attacks two months after sending his memoirs to the publisher. Although thin in his youth, by 57 years of age he had reached a weight of over 200 pounds. After his first heart attack, the U.S. Congress quickly passed legislation to promote him to general of the army on June 1, 1888, and he received the news from a congressional delegation with joy, despite his pain.

His family moved him from the heat of Washington to his summer cottage in the Nonquitt enclave of Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where he died of heart failure on August 5, 1888.

His body was returned to Washington and he was buried on a hillside facing the capital city near Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery. The sculpture on the marker was executed by English sculptor Samuel James Kitson. The burial helped elevate Arlington to national prominence. His wife Irene never remarried, saying, &quot;I would rather be the widow of Phil Sheridan than the wife of any man living.&quot;

==Honors==
Sheridan is the only person to be featured on a U.S. ten-dollar bill who was strictly associated with the military and not politics. He is featured on $5 and $10 bills.

Sheridan appeared on $10 U.S. Treasury notes issued in 1890 and 1891. His bust then reappeared on the $5 silver certificate in 1896. These rare notes are in great demand by collectors today.

Fort Sheridan in Illinois was named to honor General Sheridan&#x27;s many services to Chicago An equestrian statue of Sheridan by Gutzon Borglum (sculptor of the figures on Mount Rushmore) at Belmont Avenue and Sheridan Road in Chicago depicts the general on his horse, Rienzi. Sheridan Road begins in Chicago, continues mostly along the shoreline of Lake Michigan for about 60 miles (96 km) through the North Shore suburbs, and leads to the Town of Fort Sheridan and ultimately Racine, Wisconsin. The landmark former U.S. Army base named for the general is now a reserve post and upscale residential community.

The M551 Sheridan tank is named after Sheridan.

Mount Sheridan in Yellowstone National Park was named for Sheridan by Captain John W. Barlow in 1871. Mount Sheridan in Colorado is also named for him.

The Sheridan Prize is a yacht-racing perpetual trophy awarded to the winner of an annual race on Geneva Lake. It was begun on the occasion of the general&#x27;s visit to Lake Geneva (then, Geneva) in 1874.

In 1937, the U.S. Post Office issued a series of commemorative stamp issues honoring various Army and Navy heroes. Among them was an issue commemorating Generals Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman and &quot;Philip H. Sheridan&quot;.
Sheridan County, North Dakota; Sheridan County, Nebraska; Sheridan County, Montana; Sheridan County, Wyoming; and Sheridan County, Kansas, are named for him, as are the communities of Sheridan, California; Sheridan, Colorado; Sheridan, Montana (in Madison County); Sheridan, Wyoming; Sheridan, Arkansas; Sheridan, Oregon; Sheridan, Indiana; and Sheridan, Illinois (LaSalle County).

Sheridan Square in the West Village of New York City is named for the general and his statue is displayed nearby in Christopher Street Park. Sheridan Circle, Sheridan Street, and the neighborhood of Sheridan-Kalorama in Washington, D.C., are also named after him. Sheridan Avenue in the Bronx is one block east of Sherman Avenue. Sheridan Boulevard is a major north–south thoroughfare on the west side of Denver, Colorado. Its southern terminus forms the western edge of Fort Logan, originally named Fort Sheridan for a year after he selected the site.

The only equestrian Civil War statue in Ohio honors Sheridan. It is in the center traffic circle on US Route 22 in Somerset, Ohio, not far from the house where Sheridan grew up.

Sheridan High School is located 5 miles (8 km) north of General Sheridan&#x27;s home town of Somerset. The athletic team is nicknamed &quot;The Generals&quot;.

Sheridan Glacier, located 15 miles (25 km) outside of Cordova, Alaska was named in his honor.
In Albany, New York, there is an equestrian statue of Sheridan in front of the New York State Capitol, near Sheridan Avenue.

In January 1899, the U.S. Army Transport &quot;Sheridan&quot; was named for him. In World War II, the United States liberty ship, &quot;SS Philip H. Sheridan&quot;, was named in his honor.

Sheridan Road in Lawton, Oklahoma, leads to Fort Sill, where Sheridan supposedly uttered the words &quot;The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.&quot;

Sheridan Drive in Arlington National Cemetery partially encircles the area that contains the general&#x27;s gravesite. The Sheridan Gate, constructed in 1879 and dismantled and placed in storage in 1971, was once the Cemetery&#x27;s main entrance.

A statue of Sheridan by Allen George Newman is sited in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

New York State Route 324 (&quot;Sheridan Drive&quot;) in the northern suburbs of Buffalo, New York, is named for Sheridan Road in Chicago, and thus indirectly after Philip Sheridan. An equestrian statue of the general was planned to be built there in 1925

John Philip Sousa wrote a descriptive piece for band memorializing Sheridan. Describing &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Ride&quot;, published in 1891, as a &quot;Scenes Historical&quot;, Sousa musically characterized Sheridan&#x27;s famous ride back to his army in the Battle of Cedar Creek. The composition has six sections: Waiting for the Bugle, The Attack, The Death of Thoburn, The Coming of Sheridan, and The Apotheosis.

Sheridan Hall on the Fort Hays State University campus in Hays, Kansas, is named in honor of Sheridan. The building commemorates Sheridan&#x27;s time stationed at the Fort Hays military post.

The original site of the Phil Sheridan Elementary School in Chicago, which opened in 1888, was in the South Chicago neighborhood. In 1998, the school was renamed the Arnold Mireles Academy in memory of a murdered South Side community activist. The present-day Sheridan Elementary School in Chicago is a magnet school located at 533 W. 27th Street, in the city&#x27;s Bridgeport neighborhood.

In Broward County, in southern Florida, there is another road named after Sheridan, Florida State Road 822, also known as &quot;Sheridan Street&quot;, which runs on an east–west configuration, between State Road A1A at Hollywood Beach and U.S. Route 27, which borders the Everglades.

==In popular culture==
===In literature===
* In the novel series &quot;The Brotherhood of War&quot;, the Parker family males are named after Philip Sheridan; the two most prominent are Philip Sheridan Parker III and Philip Sheridan Parker IV. The latter&#x27;s great-great-grandfather supposedly fought with General Sheridan in the Indian Wars as a Master Sergeant in the 10th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, known as the Buffalo Soldiers.
* In Sherman Alexie&#x27;s novel &quot;Reservation Blues&quot;, Sheridan is portrayed as a head hunter for a record label responsible for the downfall of the novel&#x27;s protagonist&#x27;s band Coyote Springs. The link between the real Sheridan and the character in the book is made explicit in a brutal dream experienced by one of the characters.
* Sheridan is featured, and interacts with the characters, in Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Dragon Teeth&quot; (2017).

===Onscreen===
Sheridan has been portrayed in films and television over the years:
* &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1930), portrayed by Frank Campeau.
* &quot;In Old Chicago&quot; (1938), portrayed by Sidney Blackmer.
* &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940), portrayed by David Bruce.
* &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1941), portrayed by John Litel. The movie inaccurately portrays Sheridan as a colonel and the commandant of the U.S. Military Academy before the start of the Civil War.
* &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950), portrayed by J. Carrol Naish.
* &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; (1957) in the episode &quot;The General&quot;, Paul Fix appears as an irascible General Philip Sheridan. He appears much like the real General Sheridan right down to the handlebar mustache. 
* &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (1958) features Lawrence Dobkin as Sheridan in an episode &quot;The Sheridan Story&quot;, wherein he befriends a wounded Confederate veteran who was severely wounded in the war (Royal Dano), who is staying temporarily on Lucas McCain&#x27;s ranch n the New Mexico Territory. It is revealed that McCain, played by Chuck Connors, served under Sheridan during the war.
* &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1960) features Andrew J. Fenady in the role of Sheridan in the episode &quot;Johnny Yuma at Appomattox&quot;.
* &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (1961) features H. M. Wynant as Sheridan in the episode, &quot;The Red Petticoat&quot;. In the story line, Sheridan&#x27;s friendship with Indian scout Kahlu (Allen Jaffe) (1928–1989) is questioned after a number of ambushes result in dead troopers. Sheridan sticks to his instincts and defends his ally against the enraged residents of the fort. Stanley Andrews was the host.
* &quot;Branded (TV series)&quot; (1966) featured John Pickard (American actor) as Sheridan in six episodes, including a three-part episode in which Jason McCord (Chuck Connors) assists President Grant in heading off a heedless attack on Indians by General Custer.
* &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1978), Season 2, Episode 2 and (1979), Season 3, Episode 6, portrayed by Ramon Bieri.
* &quot;North and South, Book II&quot; (1986), Episode 6, portrayed by Clu Gulager.

J. Michael Straczynski has stated that the character of Captain John Sheridan in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; television series is intended to be a direct descendant of General Sheridan.

Sheridan is described in the PBS documentary &quot;The West&quot; (1996) as &quot;a ruthless warrior&quot; who &quot;played a decisive role in the army&#x27;s long campaign against the native peoples of the plains&quot;. And &quot;at Petersburg he won an important victory that halted Robert E. Lee&#x27;s retreat from Richmond and helped bring the war to an end.

<text>Thomas Clement Douglas (20 October 1904 – 24 February 1986) was a Scottish-born Canadian politician who served as the seventh premier of Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961 and Leader of the New Democratic Party from 1961 to 1971. A Baptist minister, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1935 as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). He left federal politics to become Leader of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and then the seventh Premier of Saskatchewan. His government introduced the continent&#x27;s first single-payer, universal health care program.

After setting up Saskatchewan&#x27;s universal healthcare program, Douglas stepped down and ran to lead the newly formed federal New Democratic Party (NDP), the successor party of the national CCF. He was elected as its first federal leader in 1961. Although Douglas never led the party to government, through much of his tenure the party held the balance of power in the House of Commons. He was noted as being the main opposition to the imposition of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; during the 1970 October Crisis. He resigned as leader the next year but remained as a Member of Parliament until 1979.

Douglas was awarded many honorary degrees, and a foundation was named for him and his political mentor M. J. Coldwell in 1971. In 1981, he was invested into the Order of Canada, and he became a member of Canada&#x27;s privy council in 1984, two years before his death. In 2004, a CBC Television program named Tommy Douglas &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;, based on a Canada-wide, viewer-supported survey.

==Early life==
Thomas Clement Douglas was born in 1904 in Falkirk, the son of Annie (née Clement) and Thomas Douglas, an iron moulder who fought in the Boer War. In 1910 at age 7, his family immigrated to Canada, where they settled in Winnipeg. Shortly before he left the United Kingdom, Douglas fell and injured his right knee. Osteomyelitis set in and he underwent a number of operations in Scotland in an attempt to cure the condition. Later in Winnipeg, the osteomyelitis flared up again, and Douglas was sent to hospital. Doctors there told his parents his leg would have to be amputated; however, a well-known orthopedic surgeon took interest and agreed to treat him for free if his parents allowed medical students to observe. After several operations, Douglas&#x27;s leg was saved. This experience convinced him that health care should be free to all. Many years later, Douglas told an interviewer, &quot;I felt that no boy should have to depend either for his leg or his life upon the ability of his parents to raise enough money to bring a first-class surgeon to his bedside.&quot;

During World War I (aged 12 to 15), the family went back to Glasgow. They returned to Winnipeg in late 1918, in time for Douglas to witness the Winnipeg general strike. From a rooftop vantage point on Main Street, he witnessed the police charging the strikers with clubs and guns, and a streetcar being overturned and set on fire. He also witnessed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shoot and kill one of the workers. This incident influenced Douglas later in life by cementing his commitment to protect fundamental freedoms in a Bill of Rights when he was premier of Saskatchewan.

In 1920, at the age of 15, Douglas began amateur boxing at the One Big Union gym in Winnipeg. Weighing , he won the 1922 Lightweight Championship of Manitoba after a six-round fight. Douglas sustained a broken nose, a loss of some teeth, and a strained hand and thumb. He held the title the following year.

In 1930, Douglas married Irma Dempsey, a music student at Brandon College. They had one daughter, actress Shirley Douglas, and they later adopted a second daughter, Joan, who became a nurse. His daughter, Shirley, married Actor Donald Sutherland. Together, they had a son named Kiefer.

==Education==
Douglas started elementary school in Winnipeg. He completed his elementary education after returning to Glasgow. He worked as a soap boy in a barber shop, rubbing lather into tough whiskers, then dropped out of high school at 13 after landing a job in a cork factory. The owner offered to pay Douglas&#x27;s way through night school so that he could learn Portuguese and Spanish, languages that would enable him to become a cork buyer. However, the family returned to Winnipeg when the war ended and Douglas entered the printing trades. He served a five-year apprenticeship and worked as a Linotype operator finally acquiring his journeyman&#x27;s papers, but decided to return to school to pursue his ambition to become an ordained minister.

===Brandon University===
In 1924, the 19-year-old Douglas enrolled at Brandon College, a Baptist school affiliated with McMaster University, to finish high school and study theology. During his six years at the college, he was influenced by the Social Gospel movement, which combined Christian principles with social reform. Liberal-minded professors at Brandon encouraged students to question their fundamentalist religious beliefs. Christianity, they suggested, was just as concerned with the pursuit of social justice as it was with the struggle for individual salvation. Douglas took a course in socialism at Brandon and studied Greek philosophy. He came first in his class during his first three years, then competed for gold medals in his last three with a newly arrived student named Stanley Knowles. Both later became ministers of religion and prominent left-wing politicians. Douglas was extremely active in extracurricular activities. Among other things, he became a champion debater, wrote for the school newspaper and participated in student government winning election as Senior Stick, or president of the student body, in his final year.

Douglas financed his education at Brandon College by conducting Sunday services at several rural churches for 15 dollars a week. A shortage of ordained clergy forced smaller congregations to rely on student ministers. Douglas reported later that he preached sermons advocating social reform and helping the poor: &quot;[T]he Bible is like a bull fiddle ... you can play almost any tune you want on it.&quot; He added that his interest in social and economic questions led him to preach about &quot;building a society and building institutions that would uplift mankind&quot;. He also earned money delivering entertaining monologues and poetry recitations at church suppers and service club meetings for five dollars a performance. During his second and third years at the college, he preached at a Presbyterian church in Carberry, Manitoba. There he met a farmer&#x27;s daughter named Irma Dempsey who would later become his wife.

===MA thesis on eugenics===
Douglas graduated from Brandon College in 1930 and completed his Master of Arts degree in sociology at McMaster University in 1933. His thesis, &quot;The Problems of the Subnormal Family&quot;, endorsed eugenics. The thesis proposed a system that would have required couples seeking to marry to be certified as mentally and morally fit. Those deemed to be &quot;subnormal&quot;, because of low intelligence, moral laxity, or venereal disease would be sent to state farms or camps, while those judged to be mentally defective or incurably diseased would be sterilized.

Douglas rarely mentioned his thesis later in his life, and his government never enacted eugenics policies, though two official reviews of Saskatchewan&#x27;s mental health system recommended such a program when he became premier and minister of health. As premier, Douglas opposed the adoption of eugenics laws. By the time Douglas took office in 1944, many people questioned eugenics due to Nazi Germany&#x27;s embrace of it in its effort to create a &quot;master race&quot;. Instead, Douglas implemented vocational training for the mentally handicapped and therapy for those suffering from mental disorders.

===PhD research in Chicago===
In the summer of 1931, Douglas continued his studies in sociology at the University of Chicago. He never completed his PhD thesis but was deeply disturbed by his field work in the Depression-era &quot;jungles&quot; or hobo camps where about 75,000 transients sheltered in lean-tos venturing out by day to beg or to steal. Douglas interviewed men who once belonged to the American middle class—despondent bank clerks, lawyers and doctors. Douglas said later, &quot;There were little soup kitchens run by The Salvation Army and the churches ... In the first half-hour they&#x27;d be cleaned out. After that there was nothing ... It was impossible to describe the hopelessness.&quot; Douglas was equally disturbed that members of the Socialist Party sat around quoting Marx and Lenin, waiting for a revolution while refusing to help the destitute. Douglas said: &quot;That experience soured me with absolutists ... I&#x27;ve no patience with people who want to sit back and talk about a blueprint for society and do nothing about it.&quot;

==From pulpit to politics==
Two months after Douglas graduated from Brandon College, he married Irma Dempsey, and the two moved to the town of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, where he became an ordained minister at the Calvary Baptist Church. Irma was 19, while Douglas was 25. With the onset of the Depression, Douglas became a social activist and joined the new Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) political party. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1935 federal election.

During the September 1939 special House of Commons debate on entering the war, Douglas, who had visited Nazi Germany in 1936 and was disgusted by what he saw, supported going to war against Hitler. He was not a pacifist, unlike his party&#x27;s leader, J. S. Woodsworth, and stated his reasons:

Douglas and Coldwell&#x27;s position was eventually adopted by the CCF National Council, but they also did not admonish Woodsworth&#x27;s pacifist stand, and allowed him to put it forward in the House. Douglas assisted Woodsworth, during his leader&#x27;s speech, by holding up the pages and turning them for him, even though he disagreed with him. Woodsworth had suffered a stroke earlier in the year and he needed someone to hold his notes, and Douglas still held him in very high regard, and dutifully assisted his leader.

After the outbreak of World War II, Douglas enlisted in the wartime Canadian Army. He had volunteered for overseas service when a medical examination turned up his old leg problems. Douglas stayed in Canada and the Grenadiers headed for Hong Kong. If not for that ailment, he would likely have been with the regiment when its members were killed or captured at Hong Kong in December 1941.

==Premier of Saskatchewan==

Despite being a federal Member of Parliament and not yet an MLA, Douglas was elected the leader of the Saskatchewan CCF in 1942 after successfully challenging the incumbent leader, George Hara Williams, but did not resign from the House of Commons until 1 June 1944. He led the CCF to power in 15 June 1944 provincial election, winning 47 of 52 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and thus forming the first social democratic government in not only Canada but all of North America. As premier, Douglas attended the coronation of Elizabeth II in June 1953.

Douglas and the Saskatchewan CCF then went on to win five straight majority victories in all subsequent Saskatchewan provincial elections up to 1960. Most of his government&#x27;s pioneering innovations came about during its first term, including:
*the creation of the publicly owned Saskatchewan Power Corporation, successor to the Saskatchewan Electrical Power Commission, which began a long program of extending electrical service to isolated farms and villages;
*the creation of Canada&#x27;s first publicly owned automotive insurance service, the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office;
*the creation of a large number of crown corporations, many of which competed with existing private sector interests;
*legislation that allowed the unionization of the public service;
*a program to offer taxpayer-funded hospital care to all citizens—the first in North America.
*passage of the &quot;Saskatchewan Bill of Rights&quot;, legislation that broke new ground as it protected both fundamental freedoms and equality rights against abuse not only by government actors but also on the part of powerful private institutions and persons. (&quot;The Saskatchewan Bill of Rights&quot; preceded the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations by 18 months.)

Douglas was the first head of any government in Canada to call for a constitutional bill of rights. This he did at a federal-provincial conference in Quebec City in January 1950. No one in attendance at the conference supported him in this. Ten years later, Premier Jean Lesage of Quebec joined with Douglas at a First Ministers&#x27; Conference in July 1960 in advocating for a constitutional bill of rights. Thus, respectable momentum was given to the idea that finally came to fruition, on 17 April 1982, with the proclamation of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

Thanks to a booming postwar economy and the prudent financial management of provincial treasurer Clarence Fines, the Douglas government slowly paid off the huge public debt left by the previous Liberal government, and created a budget surplus for the Saskatchewan government. Coupled with a federal government promise in 1959 to give even more tax money for medical care, this paved the way for Douglas&#x27;s most notable achievement, the introduction of universal health care legislation in 1961.

===Medicare===
Douglas&#x27;s number one concern was the creation of Medicare. He introduced medical insurance reform in his first term, and gradually moved the province towards universal medicare near the end of his last term. In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province&#x27;s physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the going rate for service that doctors charged. The medical establishment claimed that Douglas would import foreign doctors to make his plan work and used racist images to try to scare the public.

Douglas is widely known as the father of Medicare, but the Saskatchewan universal program was finally launched by his successor, Woodrow Lloyd, in 1962. Douglas stepped down as premier and as a member of the legislature the previous year, to lead the newly formed federal successor to the CCF, the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP).

The success of the province&#x27;s public health care program was not lost on the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 cents on the dollar from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan&#x27;s model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. The adoption of public health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals – Douglas of the CCF, Diefenbaker of the Progressive Conservatives, and Pearson of the Liberals.

==Federal NDP leader==
===Election===

The 1958 Canadian general election was a disaster for the CCF; its caucus was reduced to eight, and party leader M. J. Coldwell lost his own seat. The CCF executive knew that their party was dying and needed radical change. The executive persuaded Coldwell to remain as leader, but the party also needed a leader in the House of Commons to replace him, because he obviously was no longer a Member of Parliament. The CCF parliamentary caucus chose Hazen Argue as its new leader in the House. During the lead-up to the 1960 CCF convention, Argue was pressing Coldwell to step down; this leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party that was being planned by the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress. CCF national president David Lewis – who succeeded Coldwell as president in 1958, when the national chairman and national president positions were merged – and the rest of the new party&#x27;s organizers opposed Argue&#x27;s manoeuvres and wanted Douglas to be the new party&#x27;s first leader. To prevent their plans from being derailed, Lewis unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party&#x27;s leadership, and there was a split between the parliamentary caucus and the party executive on the convention floor. Coldwell stepped down as leader, and Argue replaced him, becoming the party&#x27;s final national leader.

As far back as 1941, Coldwell wanted Douglas to succeed him in leading the National CCF (at that time, it was obvious that Coldwell would be assuming the national leadership in the near future). When the time came for the &quot;New Party&quot; to form, in 1961, Coldwell pressured Douglas to run for the leadership. Coldwell did not trust Argue, and many in the CCF leadership thought that he was already having secret meetings with the Liberals with a view to a party merger. Also, Coldwell and Douglas thought Lewis would not be a viable alternative to Argue because Lewis was not likely to defeat Argue; this was partly due to Lewis&#x27; lack of a parliamentary seat but also, and likely more importantly, because his role as party disciplinarian over the years had made him many enemies, enough to potentially prevent him from winning the leadership. Douglas, after much consultation with Coldwell, Lewis, and his caucus, decided in June 1961 to reluctantly contest the leadership of the New Party. He handily defeated Argue on 3 August 1961 at the first NDP leadership convention in Ottawa, and became the new party&#x27;s first leader. Six months later, Argue crossed the floor and became a Liberal.

===House of Commons, Act II===
Douglas resigned from provincial politics and sought election to the House of Commons in the riding of Regina City in 1962, but was defeated by Ken More. He was later elected in a by-election in the riding of Burnaby—Coquitlam, British Columbia.

Re-elected as MP for that riding in the 1963 and 1965 elections, Douglas lost the redistricted seat of Burnaby—Seymour in the 1968 federal election. He won a seat again in a 1969 by-election in the riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan—The Islands, following the death of Colin Cameron in 1968, and represented it until his retirement from electoral politics in 1979.

While the NDP did better in elections than its CCF predecessor, the party did not experience the breakthrough it had hoped for. Despite this, Douglas was greatly respected by party members and Canadians at large as the party wielded considerable influence during Lester Pearson&#x27;s minority governments in the mid-1960s.

=== Views on homosexuality ===
During the 1968 Federal Election, Douglas described homosexuality as a treatable illness by saying it was &quot;a mental illness... [and] a psychiatric condition&quot;, as the American Psychiatric Association. Rather than treating it as a criminal offence with imprisonment, Douglas believed it could be treated by psychiatrists and social workers. This view of homosexuality was mainstream at the time, but has since raised questions about how historical figures are remembered. Nevertheless, Douglas would vote in favor of Bill C-150 in 1969, which decriminalized homosexuality.

===The &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, 1970===
The October Crisis put Douglas and David Lewis—now a Member of Parliament—on the &quot;hotseat&quot;, with Lewis being the only NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Lewis were opposed to 16 October implementation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. The act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. During a second vote on 19 October, sixteen of the twenty members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; in the House of Commons and four voted with the Liberal government.

They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it, dropping to an approval rating of seven per cent in public opinion polls. Lewis, speaking for the party at a press scrum that day: &quot;The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;.&quot; Douglas voiced similar criticism: &quot;The government, I submit, is using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut.&quot;

About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield went so far as to say &quot;Quite frankly, I&#x27;ve admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time ... I don&#x27;t brood about it. I&#x27;m not proud of it.&quot;

==Late career and retirement==
Douglas resigned as NDP leader in 1971 but retained his seat in the House of Commons. Around the same time as the leadership convention held to replace him, he asked the party not to buy him an elaborate parting gift. Instead, he and his friend and political mentor M. J. Coldwell were honoured by the party with the creation of the Douglas–Coldwell Foundation in 1971. He served as the NDP&#x27;s energy critic under the new leader, David Lewis. He was re-elected in the riding of Nanaimo–Cowichan–The Islands in the 1972 and 1974 elections. He retired from politics in 1979 and served on the board of directors of Husky Oil, an Alberta oil and gas exploration company that had holdings in Saskatchewan.

In 1980, Douglas was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree &quot;honoris causa&quot; by Carleton University in Ottawa. On 22 June 1981, Douglas was appointed to the Order of Canada as a Companion for his service as a political leader, and innovator in public policy. In 1985, he was appointed to the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and Brandon University created a students&#x27; union building in honour of Douglas and his old friend, Stanley Knowles.

In June 1984, Douglas was injured when he was struck by a bus, but he quickly recovered and on his 80th birthday he claimed to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that he usually walked up to five miles a day. By this point in his life his memory was beginning to slow down and he stopped accepting speaking engagements but remained active in the Douglas–Coldwell Foundation. Later that year, on 30 November, he became a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.
Douglas died of cancer at the age of 81 on 24 February 1986, in Ottawa and was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.

In a national TV contest, conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 2004, he was crowned &quot;Greatest Canadian&quot; by viewers in an online vote.

==Tributes==

Douglas Provincial Park near Saskatchewan&#x27;s Lake Diefenbaker and Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam was named after him. The statue &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;, created by Lea Vivot, was erected in his hometown of Weyburn in September 2010 and unveiled by his grandson Kiefer Sutherland. A library located in Burnaby, British Columbia, was named in his honour and had its soft opening on 17 November 2009. Several schools have been named after him, including Tommy Douglas Collegiate in Saskatoon, and a student housing co-op in Toronto, Campus Co-operative Residences, named one of their houses after him as well. The Tommy Douglas Secondary School in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada named in his honour opened in February 2015. Internationally the former National Labor College in Silver Spring, Maryland, was renamed the Tommy Douglas Center after its purchase by the Amalgamated Transit Union in 2014. In March 2019, a plaque commemorating Douglas as the &quot;Father of Medicare&quot; was revealed in Regina, Saskatchewan.

===Artistic depiction===
In the two CBC Television mini-series about Pierre Trudeau, &quot;Trudeau&quot; and &quot;Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making&quot;, Douglas is portrayed by Eric Peterson. In the biography mini-series, &quot;Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story&quot;, which aired on 12 and 13 March 2006, also on CBC, Douglas was played by Michael Therriault. The movie was widely derided by critics as being historically inaccurate. Particularly, the movie&#x27;s portrayal of James Gardiner, premier of Saskatchewan from the late 1920s to mid-1930s, was objected to by political historians and the Gardiner family itself. In response, the CBC consulted a &quot;third party historian&quot; to review the film and pulled it from future broadcasts, including halting all home and educational sales. &quot;Prairie Giant&quot; was shown in Asia on the Hallmark Channel on 11 and 12 June 2007.

Douglas was also the subject of a 1986 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Tommy Douglas: Keeper of the Flame&quot;, which received the Gemini Award for Best Writing in a Documentary Program or Series. Douglas was mentioned in the Michael Moore documentary &quot;Sicko&quot;, which compared the health care system in the United States with that of Canada and other countries.

In 2004, according to a THE CANADIANS encyclopedic series installation authored by Bill Waiser, CBC viewers selected Tommy Douglas as &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;.

==Fables==
&quot;The Cream Separator&quot; is a fable, written by Douglas, which aims to explain the inherent injustices of the capitalist system as it relates to the agricultural sector by making the analogy that the upper class gets the cream, the middle class gets the whole milk, and the farmers and industrial workers get a watery substance that barely resembles milk.

He was also known for his retelling of the fable of &quot;Mouseland&quot;, which likens the majority of voters to mice, and how they either elect black or white cats as their politicians, but never their own mice: meaning that workers and their general interests were not being served by electing wealthy politicians from the Liberal or Conservative parties (black and white cats), and that only a party from their class (mice), originally the CCF, later the NDP, could serve their interests (mice). Years later, his grandson, television actor Kiefer Sutherland, provided the introduction to a Mouseland animated video that used a Douglas Mouseland speech as its narration.

<doc id="213149" wikidata="Q849475" url="?curid=213149" title="Shanghai Noon">
<text>Shanghai Noon is a 2000 American martial arts western action comedy film directed by Tom Dey in his feature film debut, written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, and starring Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson and Lucy Liu. It is the first entry in the &quot;Shanghai&quot; film series.

The film, set in Nevada and other parts of the American West in the 19th century, is a juxtaposition of a Western with a kung fu action film with extended martial arts sequences, as reflected by its title, which is a wordplay on the notable western &quot;High Noon&quot;. It also has elements of slapstick comedy and the &quot;buddy film&quot; genre, featuring two vastly different heroes (a Chinese Imperial Guard and an American Western outlaw) who team up to stop a crime.

The film premiered in Malaysia in May 19, 2000 and was released in the United States on May 26, 2000. It received generally positive from critics, with praise for the film&#x27;s action sequences and Chan and Wilson&#x27;s on-screen chemistry. A sequel, &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;, was released in 2003, with Chan and Wilson reprising their roles.

==Plot==
In 1881, Chon Wang – a homophone for John Wayne – is a Chinese Imperial Guard in the Forbidden City. After Princess Pei-Pei, aided by her foreign tutor, runs away to the United States, the Emperor of China sends three of his guards and the Royal Interpreter to retrieve her. Having failed to stop her escape, Wang insists on joining the mission. The Royal Interpreter, Wang&#x27;s uncle, allows him to accompany the party, and the Captain of the Imperial Guards hopes the &quot;foreign devils&quot; will get rid of Wang. The party arrives in Nevada, where outlaw Roy O&#x27;Bannon and his gang hijack their train. Wallace, a new member of Roy&#x27;s gang, kills Wang&#x27;s uncle, and Wang, a skilled martial artist, fights off the gang before uncoupling the train cars and escaping on the engine. Wallace takes over the gang, leaving Roy buried up to his chin in the desert. Meanwhile, Pei-Pei, tricked into believing she was freely escaping her arranged marriage in China, learns she has been kidnapped by an agent of Lo Fong, a rebel who fled the Forbidden City. Fong later kills his agent after he demands an increased pay from him.

Wang finds Roy and demands to know the direction to Carson City. Roy tells him the city is on the other side of a mountain, and Wang leaves two chopsticks in Roy&#x27;s mouth to dig himself out. Reaching the other side of the mountain, Wang saves a Sioux boy from the Crow tribe and half-consciously marries the Sioux chief&#x27;s daughter, Falling Leaves, during the wild celebrations. Wang finds a small town and encounters Roy in a tavern, inciting a barroom brawl. The two are sent to jail, and share each other&#x27;s stories. Tempted by mention of the gold ransom, Roy offers to help Wang find the princess. After Falling Leaves helps them escape, Roy trains Wang in the ways of the cowboy, assisted by Falling Leaves.
In Carson City, Roy discovers that both he and Wang are wanted by Lo Fong&#x27;s ally Marshal Nathan Van Cleef, narrowly escaping capture. They reach Roy’s &quot;hideout&quot; (a bordello), and bond with each other while recuperating there. They are arrested by Van Cleef after a drunken encounter with Wang, and discover that Lo Fong is behind the princess’ abduction. As they are about to be hanged, Wang frees himself, Falling Leaves shoots Roy loose, and they escape. Wang, upset at overhearing Roy tell a prostitute he is not Wang&#x27;s friend, rides off alone. He finds Pei-Pei in Lo Fong&#x27;s labor camp, but she wishes to stay and help the enslaved Chinese laborers. Lo Fong discovers Wang and attacks him, but Roy appears, saving Wang.

The next day, the Imperial Guards bring gold to the Carson City Mission church to ransom Pei-Pei from Lo Fong, but the exchange is complicated by the appearance of Wang and Roy. Wang tells his fellow guards he will not allow them to take the princess against her wishes. As the guards and Lo Fong fight, Van Cleef arrives and engages Roy in a gunfight. Roy survives unscathed, and shoots Van Cleef through his sheriff&#x27;s star, killing him. Wang fights the Imperial Guards as Lo Fong chases Pei-Pei through the rafters of the church, but Wang convinces his guards to let him go to Pei-Pei’s aid instead. Wang and Lo Fong reach the bell tower, and Pei-Pei is wounded. Wang dismantles the bell, causing the ropes to strangle Lo Fong to death. The Imperial Guards agree to let Pei-Pei remain in Nevada, and reward Wang and Roy with the ransom gold.

Wallace and his gang arrive at the church, and demand that Roy and Wang come out and fight, but find themselves surrounded by the Sioux. At a Chinese cultural celebration, Roy shares a passionate kiss with Falling Leaves while Pei-Pei embraces Wang. Wang and Roy, who reveals his real name to be Wyatt Earp, become sheriffs and ride off after a new band of train robbers.

==Cast==
==Production==
In August 1998, it was announced Spyglass Entertainment had begun development on an untitled feature set to star Jackie Chan written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar With the success of &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, Spyglass formally greenlit the film under its new title of &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;. The screenplay was partly inspired by the 1971 Western film &quot;Red Sun&quot;, about a Japanese samurai teaming up with an Old West American outlaw.

Filming took place in the Canadian Badlands, near Drumheller, Alberta, Canada, near Exshaw, Alberta, and also near Cochrane, Alberta. The opening sequence was shot on-location at the Forbidden City in Beijing.

Curtis Armstrong had a role in the film, playing Bulldog Drummond, but these scenes were deleted.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+-to-F scale.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, the Cerealia was the major festival celebrated for the grain goddess Ceres. It was held for seven days from mid- to late April. Various agricultural festivals were held in the &quot;last half of April&quot;. The Cerealia celebrated the harvest, and may have begun on the 19th. Surviving descriptions of Rome&#x27;s city festival of Ceres are presumably urban versions of an originally rustic, agricultural festival. In his treatise on agriculture, Cato the Elder recommends that farmers sacrifice a sow (&quot;porca praecidanea&quot;) to Ceres, before the harvest.

The Cerealia is listed on the oldest Roman calendars, and its institution in the city is attributed to the semi-legendary King Numa, in the earliest Regal period. The festival&#x27;s archaic, agricultural nature is shown by a nighttime ritual described by Ovid. Blazing torches were tied to the tails of live foxes, who were released, possibly into the Circus Maximus. The origin and purpose of this ritual is unknown; it may have been intended to cleanse the growing crops and protect them from disease and vermin, or to add warmth and vitality to their growth. Ovid offers an aetiological explanation: long ago, at ancient Carleoli, a farm-boy caught a fox stealing chickens and tried to burn it alive. The fox escaped, ablaze; in its flight it set fire to the fields and their crops. As these were both sacred to Ceres, foxes are punished at her festival ever since.

&quot;Ludi Ceriales&quot; or &quot;Games of Ceres&quot; were held as part of the festival in the Circus Maximus. Ovid mentions a ritual in which Ceres&#x27; search for her lost daughter Proserpina was represented by women clothed in white, running about with lighted torches; this probably refers to Thesmophoria elements in Ceres&#x27; native cults, and the identification of Rome&#x27;s native goddess Libera with Proserpina

During the Republican era, the Cerealia and most other public religious festivals were organised by the plebeian aediles. Theirs was an elected position, with both political and religious obligations; Ceres was one of the patron deities of the &quot;plebs&quot; or common people. The Cerealia was an occasion for exclusively plebeian banquets. The Cerealia festival included &quot;ludi circenses&quot; (circus games), which opened with a horse race in the Circus Maximus. The starting place was just below the Aventine Temple of Ceres, Liber and Libera. After around 175 BC, the Cerealia included &quot;ludi scaenici&quot;, theatrical performances with religious dimensions, held April 12–18. The plebeian aedile Gaius Memmius is credited with staging the first of these &quot;ludi scaenici&quot;, and distributing a new commemorative denarius coin in honor of the event. This was an indirect appeal for continued political support in the distribution of free or subsidised grain, a particular interest of the plebs. His innovations led to his claim to have presented &quot;the first Cerealia&quot;.

Rome&#x27;s traditional religious festivals, including the &quot;Cerealia&quot;, were still managed by aediles in the Imperial era, until the banning of &quot;pagan&quot; cults and festivals. &quot;Cerealia&quot; is marked in the Calendar of Philocalus, 354 AD

Near London in the 1880s a sea-side &quot;vegetarian home&quot; (bed and breakfast) was named &quot;Cerealia, probably from the word cereal (grain).

<doc id="213158" wikidata="Q4994190" url="?curid=213158" title="New humanism (literature)">
<text>&quot;New Humanism&quot; was a term applied to a theory of literary criticism, together with its consequences for culture and political thought, developed around 1900 by the American scholar Irving Babbitt and the American literary critic and essayist Paul Elmer More. Babbitt&#x27;s book &quot;Literature and the American College&quot; (1908) first gave it a definite form; it was aimed at a perceived gap between the ideals of liberal arts colleges, and university education as it actually existed. 

Babbitt himself did not accept the qualification &quot;new&quot; as applied to his humanism, which became influential as a strand of conservative thought in the following years, up to the 1930s. Other authors associated with the New Humanist group included George Roy Elliott (1883–1963), Norman Foerster (1887–1972) and Stuart Pratt Sherman (1881–1926). Numerous attacks came from outside, especially during the 1920s.

This group was also at times known as &quot;The Nation&quot; criticism, from More&#x27;s time editing &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1909. The adoption by Seward Collins of its philosophy, or some trappings, in his publication &quot;The Bookman&quot; did something to tarnish it, in a way that external critics had up until then failed to do. Some of the members renounced the approach.

<text>The Old Man of the Mountain, also called the Great Stone Face and the Profile, was a series of five granite cliff ledges on Cannon Mountain in Franconia, New Hampshire, United States, that appeared to be the jagged profile of a human face when viewed from the north. The rock formation, above Profile Lake, was tall and wide.

The Old Man of the Mountain is called &quot;Stone Face&quot; by the Abenaki and is a symbol within their culture. It is also a symbol to the Mohawk people. The first written mention of the Old Man was in 1805. It became a landmark and a cultural icon for the state of New Hampshire, and has been featured as the Emblem of New Hampshire since 1945. It collapsed on May 3, 2003. After its collapse, residents considered replacing it with a replica, but the idea was ultimately rejected. It remains a visual icon on the state&#x27;s license plates and in other places.

==History==

Franconia Notch is a U-shaped valley in the White Mountains that was shaped by glaciers. The Old Man formation was likely formed from freezing and thawing of water in cracks of the granite bedrock sometime after the retreat of glaciers 12,000 years ago. The formation was first noted in the records of a Franconia surveying team around 1805. Francis Whitcomb and Luke Brooks, part of the surveying team, were the first two to record observing the Old Man. The official state history says several groups of surveyors were working in the Franconia Notch area at the time and claimed credit for the discovery.

===Indigenous legends===
According to Abenaki legend, a human named Nis Kizos was born during an eclipse. He became a good leader and provider for his community. Nis Kizos was successful enough to attend a Kchi Mahadan, which was a great gathering of communities, to trade. Tarlo, a beautiful Iroquois woman, returned with him. They fell in love. Tarlo had to return to her birth village because its people had been struck by a sickness. Nis Kizos promised he would live at the top of the mountain. By day he would look out for her, and at night he would light a fire to guide her back. With winter fast approaching, the elders sent Nis Kizos&#x27;s brother, Gezosa, to bring him back. He was unsuccessful because Nis Kizos maintained his promise. Tarlo died of sickness in her birth village. After the winter, Gezosa went back up the mountain to bring the news of Tarlo and retrieve Nis Kizos. He found no signs of the existence of Nis Kizos and was stricken with sadness. On his way back down the mountain he looked back and saw that Nis Kizos had become part of the mountain as a stone face to look after the land.

A modern addition to the Abenaki legend is that when Stone Face fell in 2003, he finally was re-united with Tarlo. The Great Circle was rejoined.

Denise Ortakales published a children&#x27;s book in 2005 called &quot;The Legend of the Old Man of the Mountain&quot;, which relates the Mohawk legend of a different stone face in New Hampshire, Mount Pemigewasset. In the tale, Chief Pemigewassat loved a maiden named Minerwa of the Mohawk people, which brought peace between their tribes for a long time. When Minerwa went back home to visit her dying father, Chief Pemigewassat promised he would stay and wait for her to return. However, the Great Spirit claimed him during the winter, and his people buried him facing towards Minerwa to watch for her return. His face was immortalized in the stone as the stone face, forever waiting and watching.

===Post-colonial history===

The Old Man became famous across the United States largely because of statesman Daniel Webster, a New Hampshire native, who once wrote: &quot;Men hang out their signs indicative of their respective trades; shoemakers hang out a gigantic shoe; jewelers a monster watch, and the dentist hangs out a gold tooth; but up in the Mountains of New Hampshire, God Almighty has hung out a sign to show that there He makes men.&quot;

The writer Nathaniel Hawthorne used the Old Man as inspiration for his 1850 short story &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, in which he described the formation as &quot;a work of Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness&quot;.

The profile has been New Hampshire&#x27;s state emblem since 1945. It was put on the state&#x27;s license plates and state route signs, and on the back of New Hampshire&#x27;s statehood quarter, popularly promoted as the only U.S. coin with a profile on both sides. Before the collapse, it could be seen from special viewing areas along Interstate 93 in Franconia Notch State Park, approximately north of the state&#x27;s capital, Concord.

==Collapse==

Freezing and thawing opened fissures in the Old Man&#x27;s &quot;forehead&quot;. By the 1920s, the crack was wide enough to be mended with chains, and in 1957 the state legislature passed a $25,000 appropriation for a more elaborate weatherproofing, using 20 tons of fast-drying cement, plastic covering and steel rods and turnbuckles, plus a concrete gutter to divert runoff from above. A team from the state highway and park divisions maintained the patchwork each summer.

Nevertheless, the formation collapsed to the ground between midnight and 2 a.m. on May 3, 2003. Dismay over the collapse was so great that people visited to pay tribute, with some leaving flowers.

==After the collapse==

Early after the collapse, many New Hampshire residents considered replacement with a replica. That idea was rejected by an official task force later in 2003 headed by former Governor Steve Merrill.

In 2004, the state legislature considered, but did not accept, a proposal to change New Hampshire&#x27;s state flag to include the profile.

On the first anniversary of the collapse in May 2004, the Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund (OMMLF) began operating coin-operated viewfinders near the base of the cliff. When looking through them up at the cliff of Cannon Mountain one can see a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; of how the Old Man of the Mountain used to appear.

Seven years after the collapse, on June 24, 2010, the OMMLF, now the Friends of the Old Man of the Mountain, broke ground for the first phase of the state-sanctioned &quot;Old Man of the Mountain Memorial&quot; on a walkway along Profile Lake below Cannon Cliff. It consists of a viewing platform with &quot;Steel Profilers&quot;, which, when aligned with the Cannon Cliff above, create what the profile looked like up on the cliff overlooking Franconia Notch. The project was overseen by Friends of the Old Man of the Mountain/Franconia Notch, a committee that succeeded the Old Man of the Mountain Revitalization Task Force. The Legacy Fund is a private 501(c)(3) corporation with representatives from various state agencies and several private nonprofits.

In 2013, the board called a halt to further fundraising. They announced their intention to spend what was left on minor improvements and dissolve the board.

The memorial was completed in September 2020.

Other proposals that were considered but rejected include:
* Architect Francis Treves envisioned a walk-in profile made of 250 panels of structural glass attached to tubular steel framework and concrete tower, connected by a tram, rim trail or tunnel through to the cliff wall at the original site. It won an American Institute of Architects Un-Built Project Award.
* In 2009, Ken N. Gidge, a state representative from Nashua, proposed building a copper replica of the Old Man on level ground above the ledge at the original site where hiking trails already lead.

==Timeline of the Old Man==
Details of the history of the Old Man of the Mountain include:
* 17th millennium BC–6th millennium BC — New England underwent the Wisconsin glaciation, the most recent ice age. Glaciers covering New England and post-glacial erosion created the cliff which would subsequently erode into the Old Man of the Mountain at Franconia Notch.
* 9th millennium BC — Human beings begin to populate the area, after which the Old Man is recognized and becomes the inspiration for stories and legends.
* 1805 — Francis Whitcomb and Luke Brooks, part of a Franconia surveying crew, were the first white settlers to record observing the Old Man, according to the official New Hampshire history.
* Early 1800s — American statesman Daniel Webster brought national attention to the profile in his writings. 
* 1832 — Author Nathaniel Hawthorne visited the area.
* 1850 — Hawthorne published &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, a short story inspired by his visit. The story&#x27;s title became an alternative name for the formation.
* 1869 — U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant visited the formation.
* 1906 — The Reverend Guy Roberts of New Hampshire was the first to publicize signs of deterioration of the formation.
* 1916 — New Hampshire Governor Rolland H. Spaulding began a concerted state effort to preserve the formation.
* 1926 — The formation appeared on all New Hampshire passenger, dealer, replacement, and sample license plates for this year.
* 1945 — The Old Man was made the New Hampshire State Emblem.
* 1955 — President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the profile as part of the Old Man&#x27;s 150th &quot;birthday&quot; celebration.
* 1958 — Major repair work to the Old Man&#x27;s forehead was undertaken as a result of a legislative appropriation the previous year.
* 1965 — Niels Nielsen, a state highway worker, became the unofficial guardian of the profile, in an effort to protect the formation from vandalism and the ravages of the weather.
* 1974 — From 1974 to 1979, each license plate validation sticker had a likeness of the formation. 
* 1976 — For the United States Bicentennial the formation was once again available on the state&#x27;s license plate, but it cost an extra $5 and it could only be used as a front plate. 
* 1986 — Vandalizing the Old Man was classified as a crime under the state criminal mischief law. Under the law (RSA 634:2 VI) it was a misdemeanor for any person to vandalize, deface or destroy any part of the Old Man, with a penalty of a fine of between $1,000 and $3,000 and restitution to the state for any damage caused.
* 1987 — Nielsen was named the official caretaker of the Old Man by the state of New Hampshire. Beginning that year all passenger car license plates had a small image of the formation at the top. This practice continued through 1999. The license plates distributed after 1999 were redesigned to feature the Old Man of the Mountain much more prominently.
* 1988 — A stretch of Interstate 93 (which also runs jointly with U.S. Route 3 through the notch) opened below Cannon Mountain. The $56 million project, which took 30 years to build, was a compromise between the desire for a four-lane interstate and those who sought to limit the impact on the notch.
* 1991 — David Nielsen, son of Niels Nielsen, became the official caretaker of the Old Man.
* 2000 — The Old Man was featured on the state quarter of New Hampshire and became the graphic background on passenger car license plates.
* 2003 — The Old Man collapsed.
* 2004 — Coin-operated viewfinders were installed to show how the Old Man looked before its collapse.
* 2007 — Design of an Old Man of the Mountain memorial announced.
* 2010 — First phase of the state-sanctioned &quot;Old Man of the Mountain Memorial&quot; was unveiled.
* 2011 — Profiler Plaza was dedicated on June 12.
* 2020 — Memorial completed in September.
* 2023 — New Hampshire establishes May 7 as Old Man of the Mountain Day.

<doc id="213162" wikidata="Q1479847" url="?curid=213162" title="Imperial presidency">
<text>Imperial presidency is a term applied to the modern presidency of the United States. It became popular in the 1960s and served as the title of a 1973 book by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., who wrote &quot;The Imperial Presidency&quot; to address two concerns: that the presidency was uncontrollable and that it had exceeded its constitutional limits. According to professor of political science Thomas E. Cronin, author of &quot;The State of the Presidency,&quot; &quot;imperial presidency&quot; is a term used to define a danger to the American constitutional system by allowing presidents to create and abuse presidential prerogatives during national emergencies. This was based on: (1) presidential war powers vaguely defined in the Constitution, and (2) secrecy – a system used that shielded the Presidency from the usual checks and balances afforded by the legislative and judicial branches.

==History==
Until the 1930s, the president had few staff, most based in the Capitol, where the president had always maintained an office (the President&#x27;s Room). The office later became used only for ceremonial occasions, but in the 19th and early 20th centuries, presidents regularly operated out of the Capitol Hill office. However, Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency (1933–1945) during the Great Depression and World War II altered the previous importance of the office. The new age of electronic media, the growth of executive agencies under the New Deal, his Brain Trust advisors, and the creation of the Executive Office of the President in 1939 all marked the growth of the traditionally small presidential staff.

The post-war presidency has a large executive staff most often crowded in the West Wing (redesigned in 1934), the basement of the White House, or in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is beside the White House and used by the Departments of Defense and State. Progressive overcrowding in the West Wing led President Richard Nixon to convert the former presidential swimming pool into a press room.

==Arguments for its existence==
* As staff numbers increased, many people were appointed who held personal loyalty to the person serving as president and were not subject to outside approval or control.
* Advisory bodies developed around the presidency, many of which complemented the main cabinet departments, which declined in influence. The National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget are prime examples.
* The Senate does not &quot;advise and consent to&quot; appointments to the Executive Office of the President (with only a handful of exceptions), as it does with cabinet appointments. A corollary is that EOP personnel are accountable only to the President and not to Congress.
* The presidency relies on implicit powers not found in the Constitution. The extent of foreign policy and war powers of the presidency are questioned. Also, the extent of presidential secrecy is questioned. 
* A plebiscitary presidency is accountable only during elections or impeachment, rather than daily to the Congress, the press and the public.

The presidencies of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were particularly described as surrounded by &quot;courts&quot; in which junior staffers acted occasionally in contravention of executive orders or Acts of Congress. Schlesinger pointed out activities of some Nixon staffers during the Watergate affair as an example. Under Reagan (1981–1989), the role of Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, USMC, in the facilitation of funding to the Contras in Nicaragua, in explicit contravention of a congressional ban, was highlighted as an example of the ability to act by a &quot;junior courtier&quot; based on his position as a member of a large White House staff. Howard Baker, who served as Reagan&#x27;s final Chief of Staff, was critical of the growth, complexity, and apparent unanswerability of the presidential &quot;court&quot;.

Historian Zachary Karabell argued that executive power grew further in the 21st century, due in part to congressional inaction. Citing the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama as examples, he wrote: &quot;9/11 saw the beginning of the current move toward an imperial presidency, as George W. Bush keyed off the crisis to expand executive authority in national security and domestic surveillance. In that, his administration had the legal but classified support of Congress, and for a time, a considerable portion of the public.&quot; Karabell said that this trend continued under Obama, and that &quot;stonewalling&quot; from Congress &quot;provoked the Obama administration into finding innovative ways to exercise power,&quot; making Obama &quot;one of the most powerful presidents ever.&quot; He wrote that this trend could potentially set precedent for further expansion of executive power.

Karabell later argued that the first presidency of Donald Trump had the possibly unintended effect of eroding executive power, citing the rescission of the DACA immigration policy and the Trump administration&#x27;s threat to use its position to withdraw from NAFTA as instances which have led to some power being returned to Congress at the executive branch&#x27;s expense. Nevertheless, Princeton University historians Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer argued that aspects of the imperial presidency were apparent in the Trump administration.

==Criticisms==
* The Executive Office of the President makes up only a minute part of the federal bureaucracy, with no institutional continuity, and the president has little influence as to the appointment of most of its members.
* The organization and functioning of most of the federal government is determined by law, and the president has thus little power to reorganize it.

Alasdair Roberts argued that the concept of the imperial presidency neglects several important changes in the context of governance over the last three decades, all of which tend to restrict the president&#x27;s actual power:

* The growth in the size and the complexity of the federal bureaucracy
* A battery of post-Nixon controls on executive power, including transparency rules and &quot;watchdog bureaucracies&quot; such as the federal Inspectors General, a strengthened Government Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office
* The increased willingness of bureaucrats to protest or &quot;blow the whistle&quot; on policies with which they disagree, with stronger protection for whistleblowing
* Changes in information and communication technologies that amplify the effect of official dissent and increase the capacity of opponents to mobilize against executive action
* Declining public trust in and deference to federal authority
* Declining executive discretion over the use of federal funds, which are increasingly committed to mandatory programs
* Declining regulation of the private sector, as a consequence of the post-Reagan shift to neoliberal policies, economic globalization, and the growth of corporate lobbies

The &quot;Imperiled Presidency&quot; was a theory of former President Gerald Ford. Ford argued that rather than being too powerful, the president does not have enough power to be effective. The growth in the size of the bureaucracy surrounding the president since the New Deal made the executive more difficult to control. Ford said that &quot;a principal weakness in the presidency is the inability of the White House to maintain control over the large federal bureaucracy. There is nothing more frustrating for a President than to issue an order to a Cabinet officer, and then find that, when the order gets out in the field, it is totally mutilated.&quot;

According to Dino P. Christenson and Douglas L. Kriner, presidents have considerable leeway to act independently of Congress and the courts, but unless domestic public opinion is in their favor, unilateral action risks inciting political pushback.

==Usage in other countries==
The presidencies of France and South Korea have also been described as imperial presidencies.

Especially in South Korea, because of this, the Institute for Democracy and Diversity (V-Dem) insists that South Korea&#x27;s dictatorship has been under way since Yoon Suk-yeol assumed office as president. V-Dem was based on the fact that the Yoon Seok-yeol government had taken suppressions against the opposition party.

<text>Gary Leonard Oldman (born 21 March 1958) is an English actor and filmmaker. Known for his versatility and intense acting style, he has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, three British Academy Film Awards, and nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards. His films have grossed over $11 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.

Oldman began acting in theatre in 1979 and made his film debut in &quot;Remembrance&quot; (1982). He appeared in London&#x27;s Royal Court and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, with credits including &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot;, &quot;Saved&quot;, &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He rose to prominence in British film with his portrayals of Sid Vicious in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986), Joe Orton in &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987) and Rosencrantz in &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (1990). Regarded as a member of the &quot;Brit Pack&quot;, he achieved greater recognition as a New York gangster in &quot;State of Grace&quot; (1990), Lee Harvey Oswald in &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), and Count Dracula in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992).

Oldman portrayed villainous roles in &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994), &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000). He has also played franchise roles such as Sirius Black in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series (2004–2011), James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon in &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot; (2005–2012), Lord Shen in &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot; (2011), and Dreyfus in &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2014). He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Winston Churchill in the historical drama &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; (2017). He was Oscar-nominated for his portrayals of George Smiley in the thriller &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011), and Herman J. Mankiewicz in drama &quot;Mank&quot; (2020).

Oldman also wrote and directed the film &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot; (1997). On television, he starred in the BBC film &quot;The Firm&quot; (1989). Since 2022, he has starred as Jackson Lamb, a British spy in the Apple TV+ thriller series &quot;Slow Horses&quot; for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He also earned an Emmy-nomination for his guest role as a serious actor on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; in 2001. He has also acted in music videos for David Bowie, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Annie Lennox.

==Early life and education==
Gary Leonard Oldman was born in New Cross, London, on 21 March 1958, the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921–1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (née Cheriton; 1919–2018). He said his father was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. His older sister, Maureen, is an actress better known as Laila Morse; she performed in Oldman&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot; (1997), before taking on her most famous role of Mo Harris in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He played piano as a child, but he gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;The Raging Moon&quot; (1971). In a 1995 interview with Charlie Rose, he said, &quot;Something about Malcolm just arrested me, and I connected, and I said, &#x27;I wanna do that.&#x27;&quot;

Growing up in south London, Oldman supported his local football club, Millwall, but also followed Manchester United because he idolised George Best. In 2011, he learned from his mother that his father had played for Millwall just after World War II: &quot;Just after the war, [my mother] ran a boarding house for football playersMillwall players. And I knew that my dad was involved somehow with the reserve team. But two weeks ago my mum said, &#x27;Oh yeah, your dad played for Millwall. When he was young he had a couple of first team games.&#x27;&quot;

Oldman studied with the Young People&#x27;s Theatre in Greenwich during the mid-1970s, while working jobs on assembly lines, as a porter in an operating theatre, selling shoes and beheading pigs in an abattoir. He applied unsuccessfully to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), which welcomed him to try again the following year, but advised him to find something else to do for a living. When asked by Charlie Rose if he had reminded RADA of this, Oldman joked that &quot;the work speaks for itself&quot;.

He won a scholarship to attend the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, south-east London, from which he graduated with a BA in Acting in 1979. Oldman described himself as a &quot;shy&quot; but diligent worker during his time there, performing roles such as Puck in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1979–1985: Early roles and theatre work ===
After leaving drama school, Oldman was the first in his year to receive professional work; he stated that this was not a result of being the most talented actor, but rather diligence and application. In 1979, he starred in &quot;Thark&quot;, opposite Annette Kerr, at York&#x27;s Theatre Royal. Subsequent plays included &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In December 1979, Oldman appeared as Puss in &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot;, staged at York. He also acted in Colchester, then with Glasgow&#x27;s Citizens Theatre; Oldman&#x27;s work ethic and trademark intensity would make him a favourite with audiences in Glasgow during the 1980s. He also toured Europe and South America with the Citizens Theatre company.

From 1980 to 1981, Oldman appeared in &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot; (Christopher Marlowe), &quot;Desperado Corner&quot; (Shaun Lawton) and Robert David MacDonald&#x27;s plays &quot;Chinchilla&quot; and &quot;A Waste of Time&quot;. He performed in a 6-month West End run of MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Summit Conference&quot;, opposite Glenda Jackson, in 1982. Also that year, Oldman made his film debut in Colin Gregg&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance&quot;, and would have starred in Don Boyd&#x27;s &quot;Gossip&quot; if that film had not collapsed. The following year, he landed a starring role as a skinhead in Mike Leigh&#x27;s film &quot;Meantime&quot;, and moved on to Chesterfield to assume the lead role in &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot; (Joe Orton). He then went to Westcliffe to star in &quot;Saved&quot; (Edward Bond).

&quot;Saved&quot; proved to be a major breakthrough for Oldman. Max Stafford-Clark, artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, had seen Oldman&#x27;s performance and cast him as Scopey, the lead role of Bond&#x27;s &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, in 1984. For his acclaimed performance, he won two of British theatre&#x27;s top honours: the &quot;Time Out&quot; Fringe Award for Best Newcomer, and the &quot;Drama&quot; Theatre Award for Best Actor—the latter of which was shared with future film co-star Anthony Hopkins for his performance in &quot;Pravda&quot;. Oldman&#x27;s turn in &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Wedding&quot; led to a run of work with the Royal Court, and from 1984 to 1986 he appeared in &quot;Rat in the Skull&quot; (Ron Hutchinson), &quot;The Desert Air&quot; (Nicholas Wright), &quot;Cain and Abel&quot;, &quot;The Danton Affair&quot; (Pam Gems), &quot;Women Beware Women&quot; (Thomas Middleton), &quot;Real Dreams&quot; (Trevor Griffiths) and all three of Bond&#x27;s &quot;The War Plays&quot;: &quot;Red Black and Ignorant&quot;, &quot;The Tin Can People&quot; and &quot;Great Peace&quot;. Oldman was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1985 to 1986.

=== 1986–1993: Rise to prominence and breakthrough ===
The 1984 production of &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Wedding&quot; had been seen by director Alex Cox, who offered Oldman the part of musician Sid Vicious in the 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;. He twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I&#x27;d never followed it. It wasn&#x27;t something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and &#x27;who cares&#x27; and &#x27;why bother&#x27; and all of that. And I was a little bit sort-of with my nose in the air and sort-of thinking &#x27;well the theatre—so much more superior&#x27; and all of that.&quot; He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent.

In 1987, Oldman gained his third starring film role as Joe Orton in &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;, for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor. That same year, he appeared in the plays &quot;The Country Wife&quot; (William Wycherley) and &quot;Serious Money&quot; (Caryl Churchill). Film director Luc Besson told how, on the set of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), Oldman could recite any scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot; (William Shakespeare), in which he had starred a decade earlier.

Oldman&#x27;s performances in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; paved the way for work in Hollywood, garnering acclaim from United States film critic Roger Ebert. Ebert wrote, &quot;There is no point of similarity between the two performances; like a few gifted actors, [Oldman] is able to re-invent himself for every role. On the basis of these two movies, he is the best young British actor around.&quot; Vicious&#x27;s former Sex Pistols bandmate, John Lydon, despite criticising &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, described Oldman as a &quot;bloody good actor&quot;. The performance would go on to be ranked No. 62 in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot; and No. 8 in &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;10 Best actors in rockin&#x27; roles&quot;, the latter describing Oldman&#x27;s portrayal as a &quot;hugely sympathetic reading of the punk figurehead as a lost and bewildered manchild.&quot;

In late 1988, he starred opposite &quot;hero&quot; Alan Bates in &quot;We Think the World of You&quot;, and in 1989 alongside Dennis Hopper and Frances McDormand in the &quot;Chattahoochee&quot;. Also in 1989, Oldman also starred as football hooligan Clive &quot;Bex&quot; Bissel in controversial British television drama &quot;The Firm&quot;, giving a performance that &quot;Total Film&quot; numbered as his best and called &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;fearless&quot; in 2011. Oldman and other young British actors of the 1980s who were becoming established Hollywood film actors, such as Tim Roth, Bruce Payne, Colin Firth, Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul McGann, were dubbed the &quot;Brit Pack&quot;, of which Oldman was de facto leader.

In 1990, Oldman costarred with Tim Roth in &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, Tom Stoppard&#x27;s film adaptation of his own play of the same name. &quot;Total Film&quot; praised the movie, calling Oldman&#x27;s character &quot;a blitz of brilliant comedy timing and pitch perfect line delivery.&quot; He then starred opposite Sean Penn and Ed Harris in &quot;State of Grace&quot; (1990); Roger Ebert described Oldman&#x27;s turn as the highlight, and Janet Maslin referred to his work as &quot;phenomenal&quot;. He was offered, but turned down, the lead role in that year&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. Oldman moved to the United States in the early 1990s, where he has resided since.

In 1991, he began filming &quot;Dylan Thomas&quot;, a biopic on Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, with his then-wife Uma Thurman as Caitlin Thomas; production shut down shortly after filming began. Later in 1991, Oldman starred in his first US blockbuster, playing Lee Harvey Oswald in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot;. According to Oldman, very little was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, a list of contacts and told him to do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald&#x27;s wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. He filmed scenes for the 1992 neo-noir thriller &quot;Final Analysis&quot;, which were cut.

In 1992, he starred as Count Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s romance-horror &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. A commercially successful film adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel, it was a box office success worldwide. Oldman&#x27;s performance was recognised as the best male performance of 1992 by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, which awarded Oldman its Best Actor award. He served as a member of the Jury at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Oldman became a popular portrayer of villains: he played violent pimp Drexl Spivey in the Tony Scott-directed, Quentin Tarantino-written &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), a role which MSN Movies described as &quot;one of cinema&#x27;s most memorable villains&quot;; a sadistic prison warden in &quot;Murder in the First&quot; (1995); futuristic corporate tyrant Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997); and Dr. Zachary Smith/Spider Smith in the commercially successful but critically panned &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998). He was considered for two roles in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), but neither were realised. Tarantino contemplated Oldman as gangster Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel L. Jackson), while TriStar executives recommended him for drug dealer Lance (portrayed by Eric Stoltz).

=== 1994–2003: Established actor ===

In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot;, he played corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield, which has since been named by multiple publications as one of the best villains, and most corrupt cops, in cinema. He starred as Arthur Dimmesdale in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1995). Oldman also portrayed various accents; along with the Transylvanian Count Dracula, he gave a critically acclaimed reading of German-born Viennese composer Ludwig van Beethoven in &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, and played Russian terrorist Egor Korshunov in the 1997 blockbuster &quot;Air Force One&quot;. In 1998, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; aired a match between claymation representations of Oldman and Christopher Walken to determine the greatest cinematic villain. The following year, Oldman served as executive producer of &quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane&quot;, and portrayed another historical figure, Pontius Pilate, in television film &quot;Jesus&quot;. He was also considered for the role of Morpheus in &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

Oldman appeared opposite Jeff Bridges as zealous Republican congressman Sheldon Runyon in &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000), of which he was also executive producer. Oldman received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his performance, although some claimed he was dissatisfied with DreamWorks&#x27; supposed editing of the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings. These reports were declared &quot;sloppy sensationalism&quot; by his manager, Douglas Urbanski, who said that Oldman was &quot;the least political person I know&quot;. He stressed that neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them, that they had &quot;produced this film, every last cut and frame&quot;, and that DreamWorks &quot;did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.&quot; Urbanski asserted that Oldman received &quot;creepy phone calls advising him that he was ruining his chances of an Oscar nomination&quot;. The notion of Oldman criticising DreamWorks was dispelled as a &quot;myth&quot; by critic Roger Ebert.

In 2001, he appeared opposite Anthony Hopkins in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, as Mason Verger, the only surviving victim of Hannibal Lecter. He spent six hours per day in the make-up room to achieve the character&#x27;s disfigured appearance, and went uncredited in the film. It marked the second time that Oldman had appeared opposite Hopkins, who was part of the supporting cast of &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. Oldman then returned to television making two guest appearances in the popular NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; in May 2001, appearing in the two-part episode &quot;The One With Chandler and Monica&#x27;s Wedding&quot; as Richard Crosby, a pedantic actor who insists that &quot;real&quot; actors spit on one another when they enunciate, leading to tension, then friendship, with Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc). Oldman had previously worked with LeBlanc on &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. For his performance he earned a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, losing to Derek Jacobi for his role on &quot;Frasier&quot; (2001).

Following his &quot;Friends&quot; appearance, Oldman did not appear in any major roles until 2004; it was suggested that he was blacklisted in Hollywood during this time, following the controversy that had surrounded the release of &quot;The Contender&quot;. In 2002, he starred in the generally well-received &quot;Interstate 60&quot;, and played the Devil in the BMW short film, &quot;The Hire: Beat the Devil&quot;. &quot;Guardian&quot; writer Xan Brooks described the early 2000s as Oldman&#x27;s &quot;low point&quot;, recalling &quot;barrel-scraping roles&quot; in the 2003 films &quot;Tiptoes&quot; and &quot;Sin&quot;. Although the film failed to impress reviewers, Oldman did garner some praise for his portrayal of a man with dwarfism in &quot;Tiptoes&quot;: Lisa Nesselson in &quot;Variety&quot; described his work as &quot;astonishingly fine&quot;, and the performance was later mentioned in Mark Kermode&#x27;s &quot;Great Acting in Bad Films&quot;.

=== 2004–2012: Franchise roles and acclaim ===

In 2004, Oldman returned to prominence when he landed a starring role in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, playing Harry Potter&#x27;s godfather Sirius Black. He made his first appearance in &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004) to positive reviews with Kenneth Turan of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; writing, &quot;Doing especially good work are the key people new to the series. Oldman exhibits a delicacy he hasn&#x27;t always shown with the character of Sirius Black.&quot; He continued to portray him in the films &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; (2005), &quot;The Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007), &quot;The Deathly Hallows Part 2&quot; (2011). The following year, he starred as James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s commercially and critically successful &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), a role that he reprised in the sequels &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012). Film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, downplayed claims that Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker was the highlight of the film, saying, &quot;the best performance in the film, &quot;by a mile&quot;, is [by] Gary Oldman... it would be lovely to see &quot;him&quot; get a nomination because actually, he&#x27;s the guy who gets kind of overlooked in all of this&quot;.

Oldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 2009 version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in which Oldman played three roles. He had a starring role in David Goyer&#x27;s supernatural thriller &quot;The Unborn&quot;, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel Washington in &quot;The Book of Eli&quot;. He also played a lead role in Catherine Hardwicke&#x27;s &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;. Oldman voiced the role of villain Lord Shen and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance in &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot;.

Oldman received strong reviews and earned his first Academy Award nomination and a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of British spy George Smiley in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011), an adaptation of the John le Carré novel, directed by Tomas Alfredson. To prepare for the role of George Smiley, Oldman gained 15 pounds, watched Alec Guinness&#x27;s performance in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, and paid a visit to Smiley&#x27;s creator John le Carré to perfect the character&#x27;s voice. In 2012, Oldman played Floyd Banner, a big-hitting mobster, in John Hillcoat&#x27;s &quot;Lawless&quot;, alongside Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Guy Pearce and Jessica Chastain. The following year, he portrayed Nicholas Wyatt, a ruthless CEO, in Robert Luketic&#x27;s &quot;Paranoia&quot;, along with Harrison Ford and Liam Hemsworth.

=== 2013–present: Awards success ===
In 2014, Oldman starred alongside Joel Kinnaman, Abbie Cornish, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in the remake of &quot;RoboCop&quot;, as Norton, the scientist who creates the title character. Also that year, Oldman starred in &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; as one of the leads alongside Jason Clarke and Keri Russell. In a promotional interview published in the July/August issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, Oldman slammed what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media, alleged discriminating hypocrisy by entertainers who hide &quot;behind comedy and satire to say things we can&#x27;t ordinarily say&quot;, and downplayed the convictions behind offensive slurs said by actors Alec Baldwin and Mel Gibson, attributing their statements to anger and inebriation, respectively. He went on to say that Gibson—who had faced censure for antisemitic remarks—had &quot;bitten the hand that [feeds]&quot;, being in &quot;a town that&#x27;s run by Jews&quot; (referring to Hollywood). Oldman stressed that he is not &quot;a fascist or a racist&quot;, but was nevertheless criticised for his comments. He issued multiple apologies, including on 25 June edition of the late-night talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, where he described the remarks as &quot;offensive, insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed&quot;. Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Center welcomed Oldman&#x27;s contrition (the latter inviting him to its Museum of Tolerance to screen 2017&#x27;s &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;). Director David Fincher told &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;I know him very well... Gary&#x27;s not cruel. He&#x27;s an incredibly thoughtful guy.&quot;

In 2015, Oldman played the head of police that investigates Tom Hardy&#x27;s character in &quot;Child 44&quot;, alongside Noomi Rapace and Joel Kinnaman, and had a supporting role in the post-apocalyptic American thriller &quot;Man Down&quot;, directed by Dito Montiel, and starring alongside Shia LaBeouf and Kate Mara. In 2016, Oldman played a CIA chief in &quot;Criminal&quot;, directed by Ariel Vromen, and starring Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Alice Eve, and Gal Gadot.

In 2017, Oldman played three film roles: a billionaire entrepreneur in &quot;The Space Between Us&quot;, a dictatorial President in &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;, and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Joe Wright&#x27;s war drama &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;—his portrayal of Churchill garnered critical acclaim. Oldman&#x27;s transformation into the wartime Prime Minister took 200 hours in the makeup chair, 14 pounds of silicone rubber, and $20,000 worth of Cuban cigars, which gave him nicotine poisoning. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actor, Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor, and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His Golden Globe win came despite Oldman having once been a critic of that award; he noted that he was &quot;amazed, flattered and very proud&quot; to be nominated.

In 2018, in his first post-Oscar role, Oldman voiced an evil artificial intelligence in Netflix&#x27;s independent film &quot;Tau&quot; and starred in &quot;Hunter Killer&quot; alongside Gerard Butler. In 2019, Oldman starred in horror-thriller &quot;Mary&quot;, directed by Michael Goi, and the thriller &quot;The Courier&quot;, opposite Olga Kurylenko, and appeared in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;The Laundromat&quot; as Jürgen Mossack, opposite Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas.

In 2020, Oldman starred as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz in David Fincher&#x27;s biographical drama black-and-white Netflix movie &quot;Mank&quot;, which follows Mankiewicz&#x27;s tumultuous development of the script for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; alongside director Orson Welles. The film co-stars Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, and Charles Dance. &quot;Mank&quot; had a limited theatrical release on 13 November, and began streaming on Netflix on 4 December. It received positive reviews, earning 88% on Rotten Tomatoes with the critics&#x27; consensus being, &quot;Sharply written and brilliantly performed, &quot;Mank&quot; peers behind the scenes of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; to tell an old Hollywood story that could end up being a classic in its own right.&quot; In 2021, Oldman starred opposite Armie Hammer in &quot;Crisis&quot; and in Joe Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;, alongside Amy Adams.

Oldman was also slated to direct a biopic about Eadweard Muybridge entitled &quot;Flying Horse&quot;. In 2022, Oldman starred as a cantankerous manager of intelligence agents in the Apple TV+ spy drama television series &quot;Slow Horses&quot;, based on the book of the same name. &quot;Slow Horses&quot; marked the first time Oldman played a lead role in a television series. On 20 November 2022, he stated that the series would likely be his last role as he intended to retire from acting once the series ended.

In 2023 he participated in the HBO Max special &quot;Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts&quot;. That same year he reunited with Christopher Nolan taking a minor role portraying President of the United States Harry Truman in the biographical epic thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning biography &quot;American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer&quot; and was a critical and financial success. In August 2023, it was confirmed that Oldman would star in Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s then-untitled film &quot;Parthenope&quot;, described as a &quot;love letter to the city of Naples&quot;. The film, in which Oldman plays writer John Cheever, was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, where it had its world premiere on 21 May 2024. While it earned a nine-and-a-half minute standing ovation at the end of its screening, the film received overall negative critical reviews.

==Other work==
===Filmmaking===
In 1997, Oldman directed, produced, and wrote the award-winning &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;, a film partially based on his recollections of a child he knew in school. &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot; went on to win the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film (shared with Douglas Urbanski and Luc Besson) and also the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay, the Channel 4 Director&#x27;s Award, and an &quot;Empire&quot; Award. In 1999, it was adjudged by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts as one of the hundred best British films of the 20th century. &quot;Nil By Mouth&quot; was listed by &quot;Time Out&quot; as number twenty-one of the top 100 best British films.

Oldman and producing partner Douglas Urbanski formed the SE8 GROUP to produce &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;. The company also produced &quot;The Contender&quot;, which also starred Oldman. He completed a screenplay, &quot;Chang &amp; Eng&quot;, co-written with Darin Strauss, based on the author&#x27;s book of the same name. In September 2006, Nokia Nseries Studio released the Oldman-directed short film &quot;Donut&quot;, with music by Tor Hyams. The film was shot with an N93 to promote the phone. Juliet Landau made a 25-minute documentary about the making of the video. In 2011, he directed a music video for then-wife Alex Eden&#x27;s first single, &quot;Kiss Me Like the Woman You Loved&quot;.

===Music===
Oldman has had a keen interest in music from an early age. He is a proficient pianist and stated in a 1995 interview with Charlie Rose that he would rather be a musician than an actor. Oldman sang several tracks on the &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; soundtrack, on which he performed alongside original Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock, and sang and played live piano in the 1988 movie &quot;Track 29&quot;. He traced over Beethoven compositions in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, and tutored &quot;Harry Potter&quot; actor Daniel Radcliffe on bass guitar. Oldman appeared on Reeves Gabrels&#x27;s album &quot;The Sacred Squall of Now&quot;, performing a vocal duet with David Bowie on the track &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Around&quot;. He produced a live performance by former White Stripes member Jack White in conjunction with Vevo and YouTube. At the 2016 Brit Awards in London, Oldman paid tribute to Bowie, before receiving the Brits &quot;Icon Award&quot; on behalf of the singer and his family.

===Voice acting===
Oldman participated in the creation of &quot;The Legend of Spyro&quot; games, produced by Sierra Entertainment. He provided the voice of the Fire Guardian, Ignitus. He voices Sergeant Viktor Reznov and scientist Daniel Clarke in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games. He also provides the narration of Sergeant Jack Barnes in the Spearhead expansion for &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot;. In 2015 he voiced Lord Vortech, the evil mastermind who seeks to control the LEGO Multiverse, in the &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; video game. He will play Admiral Ernst Bishop in the upcoming single-player campaign of the Chris Roberts-designed crowdfunded video game, &quot;Squadron 42&quot;.

===Writing===
In 2015, Oldman and his manager Douglas Urbanski signed a deal with the Simon &amp; Schuster/Atria Publishing Group label Emily Bestler Books for &quot;Blood Riders&quot;, a vampire book series.

==Acting style==
Oldman studied the teachings of Konstantin Stanislavski and Stella Adler while at drama school but went &quot;off-book&quot;, drawing much of his inspiration from American cinema. As a screen actor, Oldman was almost typecast as an anti-social personality early in his career. The necessity to express villainous characters in an overtly physical manner led to the cultivation of a &quot;big&quot; acting style that incorporated projection skills acquired during his stage training. He further sought to develop a distinctive approach that would distance him from his &quot;stuffy&quot; and &quot;often interchangeable&quot; British peers.

Oldman has conceded that his performances often involve an element of overacting: &quot;It&#x27;s my influence on those roles that probably [makes them] feel bigger than life and a little over-the-top. I mean, I do go for it a bit as an actor, I must admit.&quot; In another interview, he stated, &quot;If it&#x27;s coming from a sincere place, then I think the screen can hold the epic and it can hold the very, very small.&quot; Stuart Heritage of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Finding the definitive Gary Oldman ham performance is like trying to choose which of your children you prefer. The man is a long-term devotee of the art of ham.&quot; Conversely, Oldman noted that he enjoys &quot;playing characters where the silence is loud&quot; such as George Smiley in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011).

Oldman has adopted various accents for roles and portrayed a wide range of characters. He is known for his in-depth research of his roles, as well as his devotion to them, at one point being hospitalised after losing significant weight for &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, and another time had to hire a dialect coach to relearn his English accent after nearly adopting an &quot;American twang&quot; due to his children being raised American. In a 2017 interview, he differentiated between immersion and impression:

==Reception and legacy==
Oldman has established a cult following among film fans. He is known for playing the primary antagonist in a number of popular motion pictures, which has seen him referenced in popular culture. At the peak of his popularity in the 1990s, Oldman was dubbed by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;psycho deluxe&quot;, and was spoofed on popular television shows such as Fox comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot; and MTV&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, as well as drafted in to appear on the first ever cover of &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine. In 1993, he appeared in the music video for Annie Lennox&#x27;s international hit &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot;, written for the soundtrack to &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, and had a cameo role as the Devil in the video for Guns N&#x27; Roses single &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;—Oldman also played the Devil in the 2002 BMW short &quot;Beat The Devil&quot;, alongside Clive Owen, James Brown and Marilyn Manson. He starred as a sleazy priest in the controversial religious-themed video for David Bowie&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;The Next Day&quot;. In contrast to his often dark on-screen roles, Oldman&#x27;s affable real-life demeanour has been noted, and he was named as one of &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Stars in Film History&quot; in 2007. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; readers voted him the recipient of the Empire Icon Award, which was presented by Colin Firth.

&quot;Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; writers noted that Oldman is regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation. In 2012, &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; journalist Lynn Crosbie wrote, &quot;Critics never fail to single Oldman out... he is one of a few truly great living actors—arguably, even, the best&quot;. Of his diversity, Yahoo! Movies noted that he had &quot;gained a well-earned reputation as a brilliant chameleon&quot;; the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; dubbed Oldman &quot;the face of versatility&quot;. He is noted for his avoidance of the Hollywood celebrity scene, often being referred to as an &quot;actor&#x27;s actor&quot;. His work has been acclaimed by Hollywood figures: Tom Hardy has described Oldman as his &quot;absolute complete and utter hero&quot; and &quot;hands down, the greatest actor that&#x27;s ever lived&quot;; Brad Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe and Ryan Gosling have also cited Oldman as their favourite actor. Hardy recalled Oldman&#x27;s influence on students at drama school, stating that &quot;everybody used to quote him in all of his films&quot;. Jessica Chastain, Jennifer Lawrence, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hiddleston and Chris Pine have also named Oldman as one of their favourite actors.

Other actors such as Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Shia LaBeouf, Ben Mendelsohn, Johnny Depp, Jason Isaacs, and Michael Fassbender have cited Oldman as an influence; Bale called him &quot;the reason I&#x27;m acting&quot;. Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Keanu Reeves and Ray Winstone have used the term &quot;genius&quot; in reference to Oldman. John Hurt called him &quot;the best of the bunch&quot;; Colin Firth hailed him as &quot;a very strong candidate for the world&#x27;s best living actor&quot; and a &quot;hero&quot; of his; and Alec Baldwin described him as &quot;preternaturally gifted&quot; and &quot;the greatest film actor of his generation&quot;. Kristin Scott Thomas referred to Oldman as &quot;the most amazing, generous actor&quot;. Christopher Eccleston hailed Oldman&#x27;s Academy Award win for &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; as &quot;massive&quot; to people from working-class backgrounds. He remarked, &quot;Oldman is as fine an actor as Daniel Day-Lewis, but Gary is not double-barrelled.&quot; Collaborating directors Luc Besson, Tony Scott and Christopher Nolan have lauded his work; Besson in 1997 called him &quot;one of the top five actors in the world&quot;, while Scott labelled him a &quot;genius&quot;. David Cronenberg said that Oldman &quot;really is a fabulous actor&quot; who gave &quot;the best version&quot; of Jim Gordon (in Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy).

Film critics have also been vocal in their appreciation of Oldman. Roger Ebert hailed him as &quot;one of the great actors, able to play high, low, crass, noble&quot;; while Gene Siskel called him &quot;wonderful&quot; and one of his favourite actors. Peter Travers described Oldman as &quot;one of the best actors on the planet&quot;. Prior to his first Academy Award nomination for &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, Oldman was regarded as one of the greatest actors never nominated for the award; In 2009, Leigh Singer of the &quot;Guardian&quot; called him &quot;arguably the best actor never Oscar-nominated.&quot; Before winning for &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, he also carried the label of the greatest actor never to win an Oscar. In 2018, Stuart McGurk of &quot;GQ&quot; described Oldman as &quot;the master of being brilliant in bad movies&quot;.

In 1998, Oldman was honoured at the Camerimage Film Festival, where he was awarded the Krzysztof Kieślowski Award for Acting, the first recipient of the award. In 2011, Oldman received a Tribute Award from the Gotham Awards. In that same year, the Palm Springs International Film Festival announced that Oldman would be receiving its International Star Award, which honours &quot;an actor or actress who has achieved both critical and commercial international recognition throughout their body of work&quot;. The PSIFF chairman called Oldman &quot;a performer whose ability to portray the most extreme of characters is a testament to the enormity of his talent&quot;. In 2012, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; named Oldman the highest-grossing actor in history, based on lead and supporting roles. Films in which he has appeared have grossed over $4.1 billion in the United States, and over $11 billion worldwide.

In 2012, Oldman was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday. In 2014, he received the Dilys Powell Award For Excellence In Film by the London Film Critics.

In 2018, Oldman received the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards, which recognises a director, actor, writer or producer who has made a global impact and helped to focus the international spotlight on the UK Variety&#x27;s vice-president, Steven Gaydos, remarked that Oldman &quot;has blazed a path as one of international cinema&#x27;s most versatile and valued actors.&quot; In the same year, the Santa Barbara International Film Festival awarded Oldman the Maltin Modern Master Award, the highest accolade awarded by SPIFF that honours an individual who has enriched our culture through accomplishments in the motion picture industry. Leonard Maltin claimed Oldman has &quot;once again proven that he is a force to be reckoned with, and a true master of his craft&quot;. Oldman was also awarded his first Career Achievement Award by the Hollywood Film Awards. The Make-up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards as well honoured him with the Distinguished Artisan Award, which IATSE President Susan Cabral-Ebert proclaimed him as &quot;a chameleon, an actor who changes his appearance, his voice, everything about himself from film to film&quot;.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Throughout his career, Oldman has received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, three British Academy Film Awards, two Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award as well as nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two Independent Spirit Awards.

Over his distinguished career he has been recognised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:

* 84th Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role, nomination for George Smiley in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011)

==Personal life==
===Views and lifestyle===
After establishing himself as an actor, Oldman moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s. He employs no publicist and does not go to parties, telling an interviewer in 2007 that he has &quot;dinner at home every night with my kids.&quot; In 2014, he described himself as a libertarian.

Oldman&#x27;s alcoholism was well known during the early 1990s; he was arrested for drunk driving in 1991 and checked himself into rehab in 1994. In subsequent interviews, he acknowledged his problems with alcohol and called himself a recovering alcoholic in a 2001 interview with Charlie Rose. He now lives a teetotal lifestyle (he has been sober since 1997) and attributes his success in beating his addiction to attending meetings with Alcoholics Anonymous, which he has publicly praised.

===Marriages and family===
Oldman has been married five times. He wed English actress Lesley Manville in 1987, and their son, Alfie, was born the following year. Oldman and Manville separated in 1989, three months after Alfie&#x27;s birth, and divorced a year later. 

Manville stated in 2018 that she and Oldman are on good terms, saying, &quot;[H]e&#x27;s got a new wife, and we all get on... Gary and I are friends.&quot; They have two grandchildren, Matilda and Ozzy Oldman, through Alfie.

Oldman married American actress Uma Thurman in 1990; they divorced in 1992.

From 1994 to 1996, Oldman was engaged to Italian actress and model Isabella Rossellini, his co-star in &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, but they never wed.

In 1997, Oldman married American model Donya Fiorentino (sister of actress Linda Fiorentino), with whom he had two sons: Gulliver (born 1997) and Charlie (born 1999). In 2001, Fiorentino filed for divorce, claiming that Oldman had hit her in the face with a telephone receiver while choking her. Oldman was investigated and cleared, receiving sole legal and physical child custody; Fiorentino was granted limited, state-supervised contact dependent on her passing drug and alcohol tests. In 2003, a judge reduced her access to the children after dismissing claims that Oldman had drugged and physically abused them. In 2018, Gulliver, whom Fiorentino claimed had witnessed the alleged 2001 assault, lamented the &quot;pain and hardship&quot; caused by his mother&#x27;s &quot;lies&quot; over the years, while specifically condemning the media&#x27;s &quot;disgusting&quot; perpetuation of the assault allegation.

On 31 December 2008, Oldman married English singer and actress Alexandra Edenborough in Santa Barbara, California. Edenborough filed for divorce on 9 January 2015; the divorce was finalised in September 2015. In August 2017, Oldman married writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt in a private ceremony at the home of his manager, Douglas Urbanski. As of 2021, Oldman and Schmidt live in Palm Springs, California.

<doc id="213164" wikidata="Q2531899" url="?curid=213164" title="Donald Gets Drafted">
<text>Donald Gets Drafted is a 1942 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon has Donald Duck being drafted into the U. S. Army during World War II and follows his introduction to military life. The film was directed by Jack King and introduced the song &quot;The Army&#x27;s Not the Army Anymore&quot; by Carl Barks and Leigh Harline. It was also one out of two shorts in the series that featured Donald&#x27;s drill sergeant hat in the opening headshot (with the other being his following short &quot;Sky Trooper&quot;). The voice cast includes Clarence Nash as Donald, John McLeish as an officer, and Billy Bletcher as Pete who is Donald&#x27;s drill sergeant.

&quot;Donald Gets Drafted&quot; was the first of a six-part series, within the larger &quot;Donald Duck&quot; series, which shared a continuity of Donald serving in the army during World War II. The cartoon also revealed for the first time Donald&#x27;s middle name - Fauntleroy - seen on his &quot;Order to Report for Induction&quot; form from the film&#x27;s title screen.

==Plot==
Filled with enthusiasm, Donald reports to his local draft board after receiving a draft notice. Along the way, he passes several recruiting posters that romanticize military life. Especially intrigued by one for the Air Force, featuring attractive women and the promise of escorting them around, Donald decides that he &quot;wants to fly&quot;. After arriving at the draft board, Donald expresses his desire to join the Army Air Forces, adding excitedly, &quot;I came from a family of aviators!&quot; The desk officer directs Donald to a room where he is to undergo a physical examination.
Inside the exam room, a team of white-coated doctors hurriedly pass Donald around, measuring him and testing his vital signs, vision, and hearing. Several gags during the scene emphasize the army&#x27;s willingness to accept as many recruits as possible, such as a color vision test that Donald passes even after mistakenly identifying a green card as being blue. At the end of the exam Donald is issued a uniform - vastly oversized, but shrunk to fit thanks to a bucket of water dumped over his head - and has his rear end stamped with a large &quot;OK&quot;.

During basic training, Donald&#x27;s unit is marched around the field by the drill sergeant (Pete). Donald is distracted by some planes flying overhead, reminding him that he would rather be flying. His lack of concentration causes him to march out of step with the other soldiers and accidentally chop Pete&#x27;s necktie in half with his rifle bayonet when he is ordered to turn &quot;about face&quot;. Pete dismisses the other soldiers to drill Donald personally, but Donald&#x27;s inability to understand Army jargon causes him to make a series of comical mistakes. Pete finally orders Donald to stand at attention, but Donald mistakenly stands over an anthill, and struggles to maintain his composure as the ants crawl all over him. Finally he snaps and scrabbles madly to get the ants off, accidentally firing his rifle several times and striking Pete as he climbs a tree to get away. Donald is later punished by being assigned to peel a roomful of potatoes, shaving off one peel to form his catchphrase &quot;phooey&quot; in response to the chorus&#x27; lyrics that describe the good conditions in the Army.

==Voice cast==
* Donald Duck: Clarence Nash
* Sgt. Pete: Billy Bletcher
* Officer: John McLeish

==Background==
The satirical humor in &quot;Donald Gets Drafted&quot; reflects an anti-military sentiment felt in particular by Carl Barks, one of the writers of the film. He had written the lyrics to the theme song, scripted the film, and also drew the recruitment posters which Donald passes on his way to the draft board. Barks himself was a pacifist who was against America&#x27;s involvement in the war. He once said: &quot;When I saw how little we accomplished with World War I, I thought, why in the devil kill off another whole generation of young men to accomplish the same result?&quot; In &quot;Donald Gets Drafted&quot; Barks ridicules military recruitment, in particular its deceptive propaganda. The film is meant to draw a sharp distinction between the glamorous life presented in the posters outside the draft board compared to the reality Donald faces inside. Later, when Donald is at basic training, Barks pokes fun at military discipline, and even gives the sergeant a punishment of sorts by getting shot. This played well with audiences who were resentful of military strictness as America was mobilizing itself for war.

<doc id="213167" wikidata="Q1028714" url="?curid=213167" title="Jiminy Cricket">
<text>Jiminy Cricket is the Disney version of the Talking Cricket, a fictional character created by Italian writer Carlo Collodi for his 1883 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, which Walt Disney adapted into the animated film &quot;Pinocchio&quot; in 1940. Originally an unnamed, minor character in Collodi&#x27;s novel who is killed by Pinocchio before returning as a ghost, he was transformed for the Disney adaptation into a comical and wisecracking partner who accompanies Pinocchio on his adventures, having been appointed by the Blue Fairy (known in the book as the &quot;Fairy with Turquoise Hair&quot;) to serve as Pinocchio&#x27;s official conscience. In the film, he sings &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s signature song, and &quot;Give a Little Whistle&quot;.

Jiminy Cricket&#x27;s appearance bears little resemblance to that of actual crickets, which range from black to light brown and have long antennae and six legs; Jiminy Cricket has short antennae, a greenish-brown hue, and four limbs. Like most Disney characterizations, he is bipedal. He dresses in the manner of a 19th- or early 20th-century gentleman, characteristically wearing a blue top hat and a white dress shirt with an orange vest over a black jacket along with a yellow tie and khaki slacks with blue and yellow spats and carrying a burgundy umbrella and wears gloves similar to what Mickey Mouse wears. Since his debut in &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, he has become an iconic Disney character, making numerous other appearances, including in &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947) as the host and in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) as the Ghost of Christmas Past.

==Background==
===Origin of name===
&quot;Jiminy&quot;, along with variants &quot;Jiminy Christmas&quot; and &quot;Jiminy cricket&quot; have been used as minced oaths for &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; since at least 1803. &quot;Jiminy Cricket!&quot; was uttered in &quot;Pinocchio&quot;″s immediate Disney predecessor, 1937&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; by the seven dwarfs. It also occurs in the 1938 Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot;.

===Creation===
The character was designed by Ward Kimball, who had been very disappointed and was about to leave the Disney studio when much of the work he did for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was cut from the final version of that film. However, Walt Disney persuaded him to stay by giving him the assignment of supervising the animation of Jiminy Cricket.

===Voice actors===
Jiminy Cricket has been voiced in English by six actors. He was originally performed by singer Cliff Edwards, who voiced the character for Disney through the 1960s and sang Jiminy&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;. After Edwards&#x27; death, Clarence Nash voiced him for a brief period of time, until 1973, when Eddie Carroll took over the role as Jiminy&#x27;s voice actor. Carroll played the role for 37 years, until his death in 2010. Actor Hal Smith voiced Jiminy in the &quot;Pinocchio Read-Along Storybook&quot; in 1992. Actor Phil Snyder next voiced Jiminy for the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series until his retirement from voice acting in 2014 to concentrate on his career teaching. Actor Joe Ochman took over the role at that time, beginning with &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix&quot;″s installment of &quot;Kingdom Hearts Re:coded&quot;, and he has been the voice of Jiminy since 2014.

Raphael Sbarge voices Jiminy in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; where he portrays him in human form as well. In the live action adaption of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, he is voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

==Role in &quot;Pinocchio&quot;==

Jiminy Cricket begins by narrating the story, commenting that seeking refuge he came to Geppetto&#x27;s house. There, he witnessed how the Blue Fairy gave life to Pinocchio, a wooden puppet. The Blue Fairy gives Jiminy the task of becoming Pinocchio&#x27;s conscience, and teaching him to distinguish between good and evil so that one day he will become a real boy.

But the next day, Pinocchio is convinced by con men Honest John and Gideon not to go to school and become an artist, without listening to Jiminy&#x27;s warnings. They sell Pinocchio to Stromboli, a puppeteer who, after putting on a great show with the wooden boy, ends up locking him in a cage. Jiminy tries to get him out of there without success, at that moment, but at that moment the Blue Fairy arrives who ends up freeing Pinocchio.

Pinocchio and Jiminy return home, but on the way, Pinocchio is tricked again by Honest John and Gideon, who convince him to go to Pleasure Island, a place where kids do whatever they want no matter how bad it is. Jiminy tries to get Pinocchio to leave that place with him, but Pinocchio ignores it, wanting to stay with Lampwick, a boy who convinces Pinocchio to do things he shouldn&#x27;t and who constantly makes fun of Jiminy, who angrily leave the place alone. However, Jiminy discovers that all the children on the island have been turned into donkeys, and when he runs to tell Pinocchio, he sees that the same thing is happening to the puppet, already having two ears and a tail. They both run out of the place before the transformation is complete.

They both finally return to Geppetto&#x27;s house, but find it empty and deserted. They discover that Geppetto left to look for Pinocchio on Pleasure Island, and in the sea he ended up being devoured by a whale named Monstro. Pinocchio decides to dive into the sea to look for his father, and Jiminy accompanies him since he does not intend to abandon him. After a search on the seabed, they end up finding Monstro, who devours Pinocchio, while Jiminy stays outside, trying to get the whale to open its mouth to follow his friend. A while later, Monstro ends up spitting on Pinocchio and Geppetto, and after chasing them across the sea, Pinocchio ends up saving his father, which later causes the Blue Fairy to turn him into a real boy for his actions, and with which, she awards Jiminy a badge for his service as a conscience.

==Other media==
===Records===
Cliff Edwards (as Jiminy) performed the narration for several 78 RPM children&#x27;s records. Two of them were Bongo (originally part of the animated feature &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;) and &quot;The Littlest Outlaw&quot;. He also produced some children&#x27;s records simply as Cliff Edwards, including &quot;Old MacDonald Had a Farm&quot;.

On the album &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Christmas Favorites&quot;, Jiminy Cricket sang the yuletide song &quot;Kris, Kris Kringle (With A Tingle-Ingle-Ingle)&quot; in a vaudevillian Tin Pan Alley style, first singing the song straight, and the second time speaking half of the song in rhythm. He ended the song by wishing everyone a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.

===Radio===
The character hosted a one-hour segment ABC Radio special in 1947, improbably concerning the year 1960.

===Comics===
Jiminy appears in several comics (first appearance in &quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot; Vol. 5 No. 3 in 1939), such as various issues of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories,&quot; and he is featured on the covers of &quot;Four Color&quot; # 701, 795, 897 and 989. As of 2023, Jiminy has also been found in popular web comic &quot;Goofy HECU&quot;, a group of long time and loyal Walt Disney fans.

===Films and TV===
====&quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;====

After &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, Jiminy appeared in the film &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947) as the host of the cartoon segments.

====&quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;====

In the 1950s–1970s, Jiminy Cricket appeared in four series of educational films aimed at grade-school audiences. In the &quot;I&#x27;m No Fool&quot; series, he advised children how to steer clear of dangerous traffic, sharp objects, strangers, exposed electrical lines, and so forth. Several of those series were first shown on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; from 1955 through 1959.

The second series called &quot;You&quot;, teaches about the human body with the refrain &quot;You are a human animal&quot;. This, too, was originally shown on the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. The third series, &quot;The Nature Of Things&quot;, combined live-action and animation, and the fourth series was called &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;. In the 1950s, on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, he also sang two related songs related to safety: &quot;Stop, Look, And Listen&quot;, and &quot;Safety First&quot;.

====&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;====
Jiminy appeared in the featurette &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) as the Ghost of Christmas Past. The badge is given to him by the Blue Fairy at the end of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; marking him as an official conscience now declares him to be the Ghost of Christmas Past. Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck) is perplexed at his size, but Jiminy shoots back at him that if Scrooge were measured by his amount of kindness, &quot;you&#x27;d be no bigger than a speck of dust!&quot; Nevertheless, Jiminy shows him Scrooge&#x27;s bygone Christmases: while working at Fezzywig&#x27;s, and putting his money before his love, whom he never saw again. When Scrooge begs the minuscule ghost to take him away from these bad memories, Jiminy reminds him that he &quot;fashioned these memories&quot; himself.

====&quot;Disney Sing-Along Songs&quot;====

Jiminy Cricket hosted these five sing-along videos:
*&quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; (October 6, 1987)
*&quot;Very Merry Christmas Songs&quot; (October 4, 1988, intro and outro only)
*&quot;Be Our Guest&quot; (June 19, 1992)
*&quot;Friend Like Me&quot; (April 30, 1993)
*&quot;Circle of Life&quot; (December 16, 1994)

====&quot;House of Mouse&quot;====
Jiminy Cricket is among the numerous Disney characters who appear in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001-2003). He is most often sat on a table with other &quot;Pinocchio&quot; characters, or with Cri-Kee from &quot;Mulan&quot;. A running gag in the series involves Timon from &quot;The Lion King&quot;&#x27; trying to eat him, and his rescue by Pumbaa. He is the titular main character of the episode &quot;Jiminy Cricket&quot;, where he abandon his job as Pinocchio&#x27;s conscience, and becomes Mickey&#x27;s. He also appears in the direct-to-video 2001 film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot;, where after seeing that Mickey is depressed because Donald does not feel the Christmas spirit, he advises him that he can solve it by wishing on a star.

====&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;====
An alternate version of Jiminy (both in fairy-tale cricket form and as his &quot;real world&quot; human alias, Archie Hopper) is a core character on the Disney-owned ABC television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (2011-2017), played by Raphael Sbarge. In the series, which finds cursed fairy tale characters living in present-day Maine without memory of their true origins, Jiminy/Archie serves as the town counselor and &quot;conscience&quot;. He also has a dalmatian named Pongo. The series adds additional backstory for the character, portraying his life as the human son of con artists, who inadvertently causes the death of a couple after striking a deal with Rumplestiltskin; Rumplestiltskin gave Jiminy a potion to give to his parents to get them out of his life, but his parents realized what he had planned and switched the potion with an identical bottle that was given to the couple that his parents had targeted for their latest con. He is eventually turned into the ethical cricket from previous portrayals by the Blue Fairy. In his cricket form, he is charged to look after and guide the dead couple&#x27;s son, Geppetto, as long as he lives.

====&quot;Pinocchio&quot; live-action remake====
Joseph Gordon-Levitt voiced the character in the 2022 live-action adaptation of the 1940 animated film, which was released exclusively on Disney+, being a character made by CGI.

He again acts as the narrator who introduces the story, and fulfills a role similar to the animated film. Some new elements included in this version are that Jiminy manages to accompany Pinocchio to school, although the boy is expelled from the place, and after it he is unable to help him because Honest John and Gideon trap him in a glass jar, from which he later escapes. In this version he is also the one who manages to rescue Pinocchio from the cage in which Stromboli locked him up, managing to get the key thanks to Pinocchio&#x27;s long nose after lying, which allowed him to reach it. Also, unlike the 1940 film, where Geppetto does not get to interact with him, in this version Geppetto meets Jiminy at the end of the film after Pinocchio introduces him as his conscience.

His song &quot;Give a Little Whistle&quot; is also scrapped due to the pacing of the film.

====Other====
He made a brief cameo in the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), when Eddie Valiant first drives through Toontown while the toons sing &quot;Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!&quot;.

In the animated series &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, Jiminy (voiced once again by Joe Ochman) appears in the episode &quot;Disappearing Act&quot; (2021), where he makes a cameo appearance alongside other Disney magical characters like the Fairy Godmother from &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather from &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Merlin from &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, and the Blue Fairy, to help Mickey realize he had the magic inside him all along.

Jiminy (voiced with archival recordings of Cliff Edwards) has a cameo appearance in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023), ending the final part of the song &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, singing accompanied by the rest of characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios while they take a group photo.

On October 25, 2019, it was reported that Disney is developing an undetermined animated project focused on Jiminy Cricket for the streaming service Disney+. Since then, there has been no further information about it.

===Video games===
====&quot;Disney&#x27;s Villains&#x27; Revenge&quot;====
Jiminy Cricket is a main character in the game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Villains&#x27; Revenge&quot; (1999), wherein he must help the player save the stories of &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; from the stories&#x27; respective villains: the Ringmaster, the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, and the Evil Queen.

====&quot;Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour&quot;====
Jiminy Cricket appears as a playable character in the racing game &quot;Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour&quot; (2000).

====&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series====

He appears in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series as the chronicler of player character Sora&#x27;s travels, writing journals with the history of the events that occurred in each world, keeping a cast list of the figures they meet, friend or foe, among other notes with the extra features of the game.

In the original &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002), he has some direct involvement with characters and elements based on the film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. He has a substantially bigger part in the sequel, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; (2004), frequently talking to Sora and offering advice. His role in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (2005) is smaller than in the first game; he only appears in one cutscene. He also appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Coded&quot; (2008) in a major role, where the contents of his journals are examined.

<text>Totally Minnie is a musical television special hosted by Suzanne Somers and starring Minnie Mouse. It first aired February 25, 1988 on NBC. It was the first film to feature Minnie Mouse in the lead role and up until the premiere of &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; in 1999, this was the only time Minnie had any starring role. Russi Taylor, the original voice of Minnie at the time, actually met her future husband, Wayne Allwine, then voicing Mickey, while recording this special.

== Plot ==
The film centers on nerd Maxwell Dweeb (Robert Carradine), who is a loner with no friends. While watching television, he sees an advertisement for the &quot;Minnie Mouse Center for the Totally Unhip&quot;, named after its owner, Minnie Mouse. Dweeb, in an effort to improve himself socially, decides to attend.

After being welcomed by the Director (Suzanne Somers), Dweeb is taken on a tour of the centre, where other Disney characters run various courses: Goofy is a fitness instructor, Donald Duck is a wardrobe manager and Pluto is a messenger boy. After finally meeting Minnie Mouse, Dweeb is taken on by the Director. After seeing Elton John sing a duet with Minnie in &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, Maxwell feels he has it figured out and displays his new hip personality with clothes akin to Elton&#x27;s, but the Director stops him saying that it is just &quot;not&quot; him and that hipness doesn&#x27;t equal emulation of another&#x27;s style. Minnie decides to take Maxwell on a shopping spree. Then the Director, impressed by a newly made-over Maxwell Dweeb, decides to date him.

The film is intershot with various musical numbers including the duet &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; with Elton John (lip syncing to the original 1976 version) and Minnie (replacing Kiki Dee) and excerpts from early Disney shorts, including a D-TV The Pointer Sisters’ Neutron Dance &amp; number of Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Nasty&quot; with a montage of male Disney villains such as Black Pete and Captain Hook shown.

<doc id="213171" wikidata="Q956859" url="?curid=213171" title="Monolatry">
<text>Monolatry (, and ) is the belief in the existence of many gods, but with the consistent worship of only one deity. The term &quot;monolatry&quot; was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.

== Atenism ==

The pharaoh Akhenaten, who was initially enthroned as Amenhotep IV, initially introduced Atenism in the fifth year (approximately 1348–1346 BCE) of his reign during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. He raised Aten, once a relatively obscure solar deity representing the disk of the Sun, to the status of supreme deity in ancient Egyptian religion.

The fifth year of his reign marked the beginning of his construction of a new capital, &quot;Akhetaten&quot; (Horizon of the Aten), at the site known today as &quot;Amarna&quot;. Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to &quot;Akhenaten&quot; (Agreeable to the Aten) as evidence of his new worship. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes of ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.

In his ninth year of rule (approximately 1344–1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon but the only god of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the &quot;Great Hymn to the Aten&quot;.

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the imperial cult, proclaiming himself the son of Aten and encouraging the people to worship him. The people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and the pharaoh&#x27;s wife Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.

Under Akhenaten&#x27;s successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.

== In ancient Israel ==

Some historians have argued that ancient Israel originally practiced a form of monolatry or henotheism. Old Testament scholar John Day suggests that angels in Judaism are what became of the other gods once monotheism took over Israel. John McKenzie has stated: &quot;In the ancient Near East the existence of divine beings was universally accepted without questions. [...] The question was not whether there is only one elohim, but whether there is any elohim like Yahweh.&quot;

Some scholars claim the Torah (Pentateuch) shows evidence of monolatry in some passages. The argument is normally based on references to other gods, such as the &quot;gods of Egypt&quot; in the Book of Exodus (Exodus 12:12). The Egyptians are also attributed powers that suggest the existence of their gods; in Exodus 7:11–13, after Aaron transforms his staff into a snake, Pharaoh&#x27;s sorcerers do likewise. In the ancient Near East, magic was generally believed to exist, although the Israelites viewed magic as being malign in origin and were forbidden from it.

The Ten Commandments have been interpreted by some as evidence that the Israelites originally practiced monolatry. Exodus 20:3 reads, &quot;you shall have no other gods before me&quot;, and they argue that the addition of &quot;before me&quot; at the end of the commandment indicates not only that other gods may exist, but also that they may be respected and worshiped so long as less than Yahweh. In the creation story of Genesis (3:22), Yahweh says &quot;The man has now become like &quot;one of us&quot;, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.&quot;

There is evidence that the Israelites before the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE did not adhere to monotheism. Much of this evidence comes from the Bible itself, which records that many Israelites chose to worship foreign gods and idols rather than Yahweh.

During the 8th century BCE, the monotheistic worship of Yahweh in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the books of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the &quot;apostasy&quot; of the people of Israel and threaten them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.

On the other hand, medieval Jewish scholars often interpreted ancient texts to argue that the ancient Israelites were monotheistic. The Shema Yisrael is often cited as proof that the Israelites practiced monotheism. It was recognized by Rashi in his 11th century commentary to Deuteronomy 6:4 that the declaration of the Shema accepts belief in one god as being only a part of Jewish faith at the time of Moses but would eventually be accepted by all humanity.

A similar statement occurs in Maimonides&#x27; second principle of his Thirteen Principles of Faith:

== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ==


 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are three distinct beings belonging to one Godhead: &quot;All three are united in their thoughts, actions, and purpose, with each having a fullness of knowledge, truth, and power.&quot; Latter-day Saints further believe that prayer should be directed to only God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ.
 Jeffrey R. Holland has stated:
 Latter-day Saints interpret Jesus&#x27; prayer in John 17:11, &quot;Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are&quot; to refer to the characteristics, attributes and purpose that the Son shares with the Father in the hope that people can someday share in those as well. In Mormonism, being one with God means gaining immortality, perfection, eternal life, and the highest level in his kingdom. As D. Todd Christofferson states, &quot;we may become one with God&quot; as Jesus did.
 Joseph Smith taught that humans can become joint-heirs with Christ and thereby inherit from God all that Christ inherits if they are proven worthy by following the laws and ordinances of the gospel. This process of exaltation means that humans can literally become gods through the atonement; thus, &quot;god&quot; is a term for an inheritor of the highest kingdom of God. 
 To the extent that monolatry is not considered monotheism, the classification of Mormonism as monolatrous is strongly disputed among Latter-day Saints. Bruce R. McConkie stated that &quot;if [monotheism] is properly interpreted to mean that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost—each of whom is a separate and distinct godly personage—are one God, meaning one Godhead, then true saints are monotheists.&quot;
Monolatry began to be normalized and recognized in connection with the Latter-day Saint movement primarily by the works of Blake Ostler.

<doc id="213172" wikidata="Q579718" url="?curid=213172" title="Pied-billed grebe">
<text>The pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) is a species of the grebe family of water birds primarily found in ponds throughout the Americas. 

==Taxonomy and name==
The pied-billed grebe was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758 as &quot;Colymbus podiceps&quot;. The binomial name is derived from Latin &quot;Podilymbus&quot;, a contraction of &quot;podicipes&quot; (&quot;feet at the buttocks&quot;, from &quot;podici-&quot;, &quot;rump-&quot; + &quot;pes&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;)—the origin of the name of the grebe order—and Ancient Greek &quot;kolymbos&quot;, &quot;diver&quot;, and &quot;podiceps&quot;, &quot;rump-headed&quot;, from &quot;podici-&quot; + Neo-Latin &quot;ceps&quot;.

Other names of this grebe include American dabchick, rail, dabchick, Carolina grebe, devil-diver, dive-dapper, dipper, hell-diver, pied-billed dabchick, pied-bill, thick-billed grebe, and water witch.

Since the extinction of the Atitlán grebe (&quot;Podilymbus gigas&quot;), the pied-billed grebe has become the sole extant member of the genus &quot;Podilymbus&quot;. Outside its own genus, the closest relatives of the pied-billed grebe are the small grebes of the genus &quot;Tachybaptus&quot;. 

===Subspecies===

*&quot;P. p. podiceps&quot;, , nominate subspecies: North America, from Canada to Panama.
*&quot;P. p. antarcticus&quot;, , South America, from Colombia to central Chile &amp; Argentina.
*&quot;P. p. antillarum&quot;, , Greater &amp; Lesser Antilles.

==Description==

Pied-billed grebes are small, stocky, and short-necked. They are in length, with a wingspan of and weigh . They are mainly brown, with a darker crown and back. Their brown color serves as camouflage in the marshes they live in. They do not have white visible under their wings when flying, like other grebes. Their undertail is white and they have a short, blunt chicken-like bill that is a light grey color, which in summer is encircled by a broad black band (hence the name). In the summer, its throat is black. There is no sexual dimorphism. Juveniles have black and white stripes and look more like winter adults. This grebe does not have webbed feet. Its toes have lobes that come out of the side of each toe. These lobes allow for easy paddling. When flying, the feet appear behind the body due to the feet&#x27;s placement in the far back of the body. Because of the feet placement, they are not able to walk on land.

These grebes may be confused with the least grebe, although that species is much smaller and has a thinner bill. Other similarly sized grebes are very distinct in plumage, i.e. the eared grebe and horned grebe. Both species bear much more colorful breeding plumage, with rufous sides, golden crests along the side of the head against contrasting slaty color (also a rufous neck in the horned); while in winter, both the eared and horned grebes are pied with slaty and cream color and have red eyes. Because of the pied-billed grebe&#x27;s duck-like habits, some inexperienced observers may confuse it with a duck. However, pied-billed grebes have a very different bill shape (shorter, pointed at the tip, and flattened along the sides), as well as being shorter-necked and shorter-bodied than a duck. Also, unlike ducks, the closest living relatives of the grebe family are flamingos.

===Vocalization===

Its call is unique, loud and sounds like a &quot;whooping &quot;kuk-kuk-cow-cow-cow-cowp-cowp&quot;.&quot; Its call is similar to the yellow-billed cuckoo.

==Distribution and habitat==

They are most commonly found throughout North and Central America, the Caribbean, and South America year round. During the summer breeding season, they are most prevalent in central, northern and northeastern Canada. If they live in an area where the water freezes in the winter they will migrate. Migrating birds generally meet with year-round birds in September and October. They migrate at night. Most migratory birds leave in March or April. They make occasional appearances in Europe and Hawaii. In the United Kingdom, pied-billed grebe visits have numbered 45 sightings as of 2019, appearing generally in October to January. One bird in England bred with a little grebe, producing hybrid young. It is the only grebe on record to have visited the Galapagos Islands.

Pied-billed grebes are found in freshwater wetlands with emergent vegetation, such as cattails. They are occasionally found in salt water. When breeding they are found in emergent vegetation near open water, and in the winter they are primarily found in open water due to the lack of nests to maintain. They may live near rivers, but prefer still water. They may be found in higher elevations when migrating. They will breed in restored and man-made wetlands.

Pied-billed grebes live approximately 10–12 years.

==Behaviour==

Pied-billed grebes rarely fly. They make a slow dive frequently, especially when in danger, diving to about or less. They dive for about 30 seconds and may move to a more secluded area of the water, allowing only the head to be visible to watch the danger dissipate. This frequency in diving has earned them the description of being reclusive or shy in nature. It has also earned them nicknames like &quot;hell-diver.&quot; Pied-billed grebes can trap air in their feathers, which controls their buoyancy. They rarely spend time in flocks. Their courtship include calling and sometimes duets. Males will show territorial behaviour if another male is at the edge of his territory. They face each other and then turn their heads and bills up. Then they turn away and start calling. Then they turn back around to look at one another.

===Breeding===

The pied-billed grebe breeds in south-central Canada, throughout the United States, Central America, the Caribbean, and temperate South America. These grebes may lay up to two sets of eggs a year. Their nests sit on top of the water, their eggs sitting in vegetation that resides in the water. Grebes lay between three and ten bluish white smooth elliptical eggs with the female starting the incubation process. They are incubated for around 23 days by both parents, with the female taking over incubation duties towards the end of that time period. They will cover the nest with nesting material if they have to leave it for an extended period of time.

Young grebes may leave the nest within one day of hatching. They are downy at birth. Yellow skin is seen between the lore and top of the head. They do not swim well and stay out of the water. They sleep on their parents&#x27; backs. Within four weeks they start swimming. When alerted they will climb on the back of a parent grebe and eventually mature to dive under the water like their parents. Both parents share the role of raising the young – both feeding and carrying them on their backs. Sometimes the parents will dive underwater to get food with the chicks on their backs.

===Diet===

Pied-billed grebes feed mainly on aquatic invertebrates, and also on small fish and amphibians (frogs, tadpoles). They dive to obtain food. Their bills allow them to crush crustaceans, like crawfish. They may also eat plants. They have been shown to eat their own feathers, like other grebes, to aid in digestion (prevent injury from small bones). They will also feed their feathers to their young.

===Threats===

They are extremely sensitive to disturbances, especially by humans. While breeding, if scared, adults may abandon their nests without protecting the eggs. The waves from boats can destroy the nests and their sounds easily frighten the birds.

==In culture==

Pied-billed grebe feathers are thick and soft. Their feathers were formerly used as decorations on hats and earmuffs and they were hunted in the eastern United States, in the 19th century.

==Status==

The status of pied-billed grebes in the Northeastern United States is dire; they are declining in New England. The reasons are unknown. The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire have declared the pied-billed grebe as endangered. In New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have been declared threatened. In Vermont they are of &quot;special concern.&quot; In Rhode Island they are extirpated. Pied-billed grebes are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

Habitat loss is the grebe&#x27;s biggest threat. The draining, filling, and general destruction of wetlands causes a loss in their breeding habitats. However, they are still common in the majority of their distribution areas.

<doc id="213176" wikidata="Q3894796" url="?curid=213176" title="Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold">
<text>&quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot; is a Disney comics story starring Donald Duck that was originally printed in &quot;Four Color&quot; #9 (the first &quot;Four Color&quot; issue titled &quot;Donald Duck&quot;) in October 1942. The script was by Bob Karp and illustrated by Carl Barks and Jack Hannah. The story is significant for launching the first American Donald Duck adventure comic series, and for being Barks&#x27; first duck comics work.

The storyline was originally developed for a Mickey Mouse feature cartoon (under the title &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Ghost&quot;) in which Mickey Mouse, Donald, and Goofy meet Yellow Beak and encounter Pete, but the cartoon was never produced.

==Plot==
In this story, Donald and his three nephews meet a parrot named Yellow Beak and they wind up searching for the lost treasure of Henry Morgan. Unfortunately for them, Black Pete wants the treasure too.

==Production==
Disney historian Jim Korkis reports the notion of taking the unmade feature and adapting the storyline for publication as a comic book occurred when Dell Comics editor Oskar Lebeck &quot;was given permission to look through the Disney files of cartoon ideas that were shelved. He found the over 800 numbered sketches for &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Ghost&quot; and was instantly struck that most of the work had already been done in terms of visualizing the story. Lebeck felt it could easily be adapted into a Donald Duck comic book story.&quot;

Bob Karp, who wrote the script, was a gag writer for the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; newspaper comic strip.

Hannah recalled John Clarke Rose, Story Research Director at the Disney Studio, &quot;took us to meet Eleanor Packer who I believe was in charge of Whitman/Western Publishing. They wanted us to draw 64 pages of a Donald Duck story. I suspect the reason we were chosen for this assignment was that it was a more story related project. We were doing all the Donald Duck stories for the shorts and doing all the story sketches at the time so I&#x27;m just guessing that they probably felt we could work out this story as well, maybe even add in a few touches to help it flow properly.&quot;

In 1993, Barks recalled, &quot;Jack and I looked the script over and decided which pages we would like to draw. After we had drawn a few pages, we decided that I should draw all of the stuff that was involved with the ducks outside on the deck of the boat or on the island, and Jack would take care of the inside stuff.&quot; The two artists inked their own work.

Almost half of the story&#x27;s pages have no words, relying instead on the visual style preferred for animation. &quot;That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so little dialogue in &quot;Pirate Gold&quot;,&quot; Barks said in 1983. &quot;Bob took it from the storyboards. In animation they wanted things moving on the screen: they didn&#x27;t want characters in held positions moving their lips.&quot;

Before this story, the first Donald Duck adventure comics had so far only appeared in Italy, in the 1937–1940 Italian Disney comics magazine &quot;Donald Duck and Other Adventures&quot; (&quot;Paperino e altre avventure&quot;) by Federico Pedrocchi. 

==Sequels==
Two sequels to this story were published.

&quot;Donald Duck and the Pirates&quot; (Cheerios Giveaway #W1, 1947) by Chase Craig and Jack Hannah, has Yellow Beak accompany Donald and his nephews to an island to find buried treasure. This story was reprinted in the US in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; #365 (2011).

In &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold... Again!&quot; (originally titled &quot;Bacicin riprende il mare&quot; in &quot;Almanacco Topolino&quot; #71, Nov 1962), by Abramo Barosso, Giampaolo Barosso, and Giovan Battista Carpi, Bacicin Parodi (Yellow Beak) comes out of retirement to tempt Donald, his nephews and Uncle Scrooge on another treasure hunt, followed by the Beagle Boys. This story was reprinted in the US in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; #366 (2011).

Yellow Beak also appeared in two more Disney comics stories:

* &quot;The Seven Dwarfs and the Pirate&quot; in &quot;Four Color&quot; #229 (May 1949), by Tony Strobl
* &quot;Captain Hook and the Buried Treasure&quot; in &quot;Peter Pan Treasure Chest&quot; #1 (Jan. 1953), by Del Connell and Dick Moores

<text>John Frederick Hannah (January 5, 1913 – June 11, 1994) was an American animator, writer and director of animated shorts. He worked for Disney and Walter Lantz.

==Biography==
Hannah was born on January 5, 1913, in Nogales, Arizona. After attending grammar school in Nogales, Arizona and high school in National City, California, he moved to Los Angeles in 1931 to study at the Art Guild Academy. One of his first jobs was designing movie posters for Hollywood theaters for the advertising firm Foster &amp; Kleiser. In 1933, during the Great Depression, Hannah dropped off his portfolio at Walt Disney Studios, and soon afterward was hired as an in-between and clean-up artist, working on Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Silly Symphony cartoons.

Hannah&#x27;s career as an animator commenced with the short &quot;Modern Inventions&quot; (released on May 29, 1937). After thirteen films in that capacity, he was assigned to the story department writing cartoon short continuities, beginning with &quot;Donald&#x27;s Nephews&quot; (released on April 15, 1938). He received writing credit on 21 Disney cartoon shorts.

In 1942, he collaborated with Carl Barks on the first two comic books Barks worked on, &quot;Pluto Saves the Ship&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot;. Hannah in subsequent years did a handful of other Donald Duck comic book stories but, unlike Barks, he stayed at the studio and eventually was given a chance to be a director. The short &quot;Donald&#x27;s Off Day&quot; (released on December 8, 1944) was the first of 94 films he would direct. These include most of the shorts featuring Donald Duck in the post-war era along with all starring Chip &#x27;n Dale and Humphrey the Bear; he also directed some shorts starring Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Pluto and some minor Disney characters such as &quot;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&quot;.

After Disney stopped producing animated shorts, Hannah did 14 episodes of the Walt Disney anthology television series (composed of footage from the classic cartoons along with new linking material) and fulfilled his ambition to direct live-action by handling Walt Disney&#x27;s introductions for the episodes. Hannah hoped to segue into a career in live-action but &quot;Walt had me pegged as an animation director so he balked at the suggestion. We had a few heated discussions and I became aware that I had come to an impasse.&quot;
Hannah then went to Walter Lantz Productions and directed a number of films featuring Woody Woodpecker and most of the Woody Woodpecker, Chilly Willy, and Dynamo Doc shorts directed by Jack Hannah had music by former-Warner Bros. composer and songwriter Eugene Poddany, who composed the shorts from 1960 to 1962, replaced by Darrell Calker, who composed from 1961 to 1964, and Clarence Wheeler who composed for Lantz from 1950 to 1967, and one short directed by Jack Hannah had Walter Greene as composer and Charles Mintz veteran Sid Marcus as director entitled &quot;Greedy Gabby Gator&quot; (released on January 1, 1963) and some minor characters. Besides directing shorts, Hannah also was assistant director for the television series &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot;, which began airing on October 3, 1957. &quot;I did more or less the same thing that I did with Walt Disney in directing live-action except Lantz was better at taking direction.&quot; For his final days at Lantz, his shorts needed animation by Art Davis until he left in April 1963, His last directing effort was the short &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Mother in Law&quot; (released on April 16, 1963). He retired shortly thereafter and replaced by Sid Marcus, who co-directed the Woody Woodpecker short &quot;Greedy Gabby Gator&quot;, released in 1963 with Jack Hannah as co-director with Sid Marcus, who directed at Lantz until 1967.

In 1975, Hannah was one of the co-founders, along with T. Hee, of the Character Animation program at the California Institute of the Arts.

Hannah was honored as a &quot;Disney Legend&quot; in 1992. Jack Hannah is often credited with developing, if not creating, the personality of the animated version of Donald Duck. It is for this reason Disney historian Jim Korkis has dubbed him &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s Other Daddy.&quot; Despite that, Hannah has often been noted for being responsible for Donald&#x27;s most formulaic period, where constantly paired Donald with pint-sized antagonists. The most famous of these antagonists are Chip &#x27;n Dale, but other characters included Spike the Bee, Bootle Beetle and a colony of ants. These vermin became the focus of their shorts, relegating Donald to a supporting foil role with a consequent personality diminution.

Hannah died from cancer in Burbank, California on June 11, 1994, at age 81. He is survived by his wife and two children.

<doc id="213179" wikidata="Q7772558" url="?curid=213179" title="The Victory Garden (comics)">
<text>&quot;The Victory Garden&quot; is the first 10-page Disney comics story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks starring Donald Duck. It was originally published in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #31 (April 1943). The story has been reprinted many times.

==Plot==
Donald tries to grow a victory garden, but three pesky crows keep eating his seeds. After many failed attempts to outwit the crows, Donald&#x27;s nephews give Donald a victory garden in his own bedroom with the aid of invisible seeds.

==Production==
Barks was given a script by the studio, accompanied by the following note: &quot;Here is a 10-page story for Donald Duck. Hope that you like it. You are to stage it, of course. And if you see that it can be strengthened, or that it deviates from Donald either in narration or action, please make the improvements.&quot; 

In a 1973 interview, Barks said, &quot;It was a rather indefinite sort of script. I worked it over and made more sense out of it. It was one of those things they dashed out real fast. I think Eleanor Packer, who was the editor down there, just did it with her left hand while she was doing something else with her right hand. She was one of those geniuses in a way. She could think real fast and put her stuff right through without ever second-guessing it. She expected me to turn out stories like that. She was quite surprised when I turned in the next story — the one about the &quot;rabbit&#x27;s foot&quot; — she was quite surprised that I could just go ahead and do something like that without doing it her way.&quot;

From then on, Barks both scripted and illustrated his stories, with few exceptions.

<doc id="213181" wikidata="Q560005" url="?curid=213181" title="William III of Sicily">
<text>William III (; c. 1186 c. 1198), a scion of the Hauteville dynasty, was the last Norman King of Sicily, who reigned briefly for ten months in 1194. He was overthrown by his great-aunt Constance and her husband Emperor Henry VI.

== Life and reign ==
William was the second son of Count Tancred of Lecce and his wife Sibylla of Acerra. When in 1189 King William II of Sicily died childless, Tancred, an illegitimate son of the Norman duke Roger III of Apulia gained the support of Pope Clement III to be crowned King of Sicily, denying the rights of his aunt Constance, daughter of late King Roger II.

At the age of four, shortly after the death of his older brother Roger, William had been crowned co-ruler by his father, Tancred, in Palermo. His father died on 20 February 1194, while his mother, Sibylla, acted as his regent.

However, Constance&#x27;s husband, the Hohenstaufen emperor Henry VI claimed the throne of Sicily in right of his wife. Even before Tancred&#x27;s death he had been laying plans to invade, and his resources had been further augmented by the ransom he had received for the release of King Richard I of England.

== Overthrow and death ==

In August 1194 Henry marched against Sicily. Sibylla was unable to organize much effective resistance. By the end of October Henry had conquered all the mainland parts of the kingdom and crossed over into the island of Sicily. On 20 November Palermo fell, William and his mother fled to Caltabellotta Castle.

Henry offered Sibylla generous terms: William was to retain the County of Lecce, the home territory of his father before he had become king, and was also to retain the Principality of Taranto in turn for renouncing the royal crown. With that agreement reached, William, his mother and his sisters watched while Henry was crowned King of Sicily on 25 December. Nevertheless, four days later, an alleged conspiracy against the new king was uncovered, and many of the leading Italo-Norman political figures were arrested and sent to prison in Germany, including William and his family.

While his mother and sisters were eventually released and lived in obscurity in France, nothing is known for certain of William&#x27;s subsequent fate. He is said to have been blinded and castrated, on orders of Henry. According to some sources he died in captivity at Hohenems Castle a few years later. Another theory is that he later returned to Sicily under the alias Tancredi Palamara. Henry&#x27;s son, Emperor Frederick II (who was also king of Sicily) discovered Tancredi Palamara in Messina and had him executed in 1232. However, referring to several letters by Pope Celestine III, the date generally accepted for his death is 1198. William&#x27;s heir was his younger sister, whose precise name is unclear but has been given variously as Mary, Elvira, Albinia or Blanche.

<doc id="213183" wikidata="Q473539" url="?curid=213183" title="Giuseppe Siri">
<text>Giuseppe Siri (20 May 1906 – 2 May 1989) was an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Genoa from 1946 to 1987, and was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 1953. A protege of Pope Pius XII, he took part in the Second Vatican Council, and was at one point considered a &quot;papabile&quot;.

==Early life and ministry==
Siri was born in Genoa to Nicolò and Giulia (née Bellavista) Siri. He entered the minor seminary of Genoa on 16 October 1916, and attended the major seminary from 1917 to 1926. Siri then studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Carlo Minoretti on 22 September 1928. Finishing his studies at the Gregorian, he earned his doctorate in theology &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and also did pastoral work in Rome until autumn 1929.

Upon returning to Genoa, Siri served as a chaplain until he became a professor of dogmatic theology at the major seminary in 1930, also teaching fundamental theology for a year. In addition to his academic duties, Siri was a preacher, public speaker, and professor of religion at the classical lyceums named to &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and &quot;Giuseppe Mazzini&quot; from 1931 to 1936. He was named prosynodal examiner in the archdiocesan curia in 1936 and rector of &quot;Collegio Teologico S. Tommaso d&#x27;Aquino&quot; in 1937.

==Episcopal career==

On 14 March 1944, Siri was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Genoa and Titular Bishop of &quot;Livias&quot; by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 7 May from Cardinal Pietro Boetto at the St. Lawrence Cathedral. He became vicar general for the archdiocese on 8 September 1944. During his tenure as an auxiliary, he was a member of the Italian resistance movement in World War II. He negotiated with the Nazi forces surrounding Genoa and met secretly with partisan leaders, eventually arranging a Nazi surrender that avoided further bombardment of the city.

Following the death of Cardinal Boetto, Siri was named Archbishop of Genoa on 14 May 1946, and installed on 29 May of that year. Pius XII made him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome, in the consistory of 12 January 1953. At the time of his elevation, he was the youngest member of the College of Cardinals. He became known as the &quot;minestrone cardinal&quot; for his relief work in soup kitchens.

Pope John XXIII named Siri the first president of the Italian Episcopal Conference on 12 October 1959. He remained in that post until 1965. He was noted for his staunchly conservative views. At the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), he sat on its Board of Presidency but was anxious that the council&#x27;s progress in renewing the Catholic Church could be happening too quickly. Alongside Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Thomas Cooray, he was part of the association of traditionalist Council fathers named &quot;Coetus Internationalis Patrum&quot; but Siri commented, &quot;I would describe myself as an independent, a man who walks alone and is not a member of any group.&quot; He was opposed to collegiality, as well as innovation.

Siri, who had voted in the papal conclaves of 1958 and 1963, was also one of the cardinal electors in the August and October 1978 conclaves. He was a strong candidate for the papacy, or &quot;papabile&quot;, in all four conclaves, in which his support lay mostly with curialists and other conservative cardinals. Media reports suggested that Siri in fact topped the first count of votes in the August 1978 conclave before losing to Albino Luciani, who became Pope John Paul I. Following John Paul I&#x27;s death, Siri was the leading conservative candidate in opposition to Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, the Archbishop of Florence and leading liberal candidate. Vaticanologists suggested that the eventual winner, Cardinal Wojtyła, who became Pope John Paul II, was chosen as a compromise candidate between the two. Shortly afterwards, Siri implied that he disapproved of Wojtyła&#x27;s election.

In a biography of Siri, reports that Siri was a friend of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre but disapproved of his reported schismatic activities. Even until the last minute, Siri begged him (&quot;on his knees&quot;) not to break with the Holy See. In the end, Siri resigned himself to the inevitability of his friend&#x27;s excommunication. Buonasorte commented: &quot;In all probability, it is due to Siri that Lefebvre had no significant following in Italy.&quot;
Siri reached age 80 in 1986 and thus lost the right to participate in future conclaves; he was the last remaining cardinal elector who had been elevated by Pope Pius XII. Siri resigned from his post in Genoa on 6 July 1987, after 41 years of service. He died in Villa Campostano, Genoa, at age 82, and was buried at San Lorenzo Metropolitan Cathedral in Genoa.

==Conclave speculation==

Siri was considered a strong candidate in the 1958 papal conclave held to elect a successor to replace Pius XII. On the evening of 26 October, the first day of the conclave, apparent white smoke was seen coming from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, a traditional signal to the crowds in the square outside that a pope has been elected. No announcement was made, and after about half an hour the smoke turned black, indicating that there was no result. Vatican Radio corrected its report.

Sometime in the late 1980s, an American traditionalist Catholic named Gary Giuffre began to expound the belief that Siri was the true pope and that he was held captive in a monastery in Rome. According to Giuffre and his followers, the white smoke that was seen on 26 October 1958 meant that a pope had been elected, and that pope was Siri, who was forced to reject the papacy because of threats from outside the conclave. Roncalli, who they claimed was a Freemason, was elected instead as Pope John XXIII. It was also claimed that this occurred during the 1963 papal conclave that elected Giovanni Battista Montini as Pope Paul VI.

Siri himself never made these claims and accepted the authority of all popes in his lifetime. He was appointed president of the Italian Episcopal Conference by Pope John XXIII in 1959, and remained in the post under Pope Paul VI until 1964. He was a candidate for pope in the August 1978 papal conclave that followed the death of Paul VI, where he is thought to have led in the early ballot; the conclave eventually elected Albino Luciani as Pope John Paul I, and again two months later in the October 1978 papal conclave, where he is also thought to have come within a few votes of election before the eventual election of Cardinal Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. Siri never made any reference to what became known as the &quot;Siri thesis&quot;, and there was no mention of it in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, in the biography written by Raimondo Spiazzi, or in a speech given by Giulio Andreotti on the centenary of Siri&#x27;s birth in 2006.

<text>The western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis) is a species in the grebe family of water birds. Folk names include &quot;dabchick&quot;, &quot;swan grebe&quot; and &quot;swan-necked grebe&quot;.

Western grebe fossils from the Late Pleistocene of southwest North America were described as a distinct species, but later ranked as a paleosubspecies &quot;Aechmophorus occidentalis lucasi&quot;. More recent study found them to fall within the variation now known to exist in today&#x27;s birds.

==Description==
The western grebe is the largest North American grebe. It is long, weighs and measures across the wings. It is black-and-white, with a long, slender, swan-like neck and red eyes. It is easily confused with Clark&#x27;s grebe, which shares similar features, body size, behavior and habitat, and hybrids are known. Western grebes nest in colonies on lakes that are mixed with marsh vegetation and open water. Western Grebe nests are made of plant debris and sodden materials, and the nest-building begins roughly around late April through June. The construction is done by both sexes and is continued on throughout laying and incubation. This species of waterbirds is widespread in western North America, so there is no specific place of abundance. Its subspecies, Clark&#x27;s grebe generally populate more of the southern part of North America Other differences are whiter flanks and paler gray backs when comparing A.o.clarkii to A.o.occidentalis. 
The western grebe has black around the eyes and a straight greenish-yellow bill whereas the Clark&#x27;s grebe has white around the eyes and an up-turned bright yellow bill. The downy young of Western are grey; Clark&#x27;s downy young are white.
===Subspecies===

In 1858 George Newbold Lawrence recognised &quot;Podiceps occidentalis&quot; based on darker coloured specimens, and &quot;P. clarkii&quot; based on three paler coloured specimens -two from California and one from Chihuahua. These two colour morphs were found to occur, roost and even interbreed together, and were long regarded to be synonyms (although it is unclear why &quot;P. clarkii&quot; was regarded as the junior synonym, coming alphabetically first). Deignan designated the Mexican specimen as the holotype of the taxon &quot;P. clarkii&quot; in 1961. In 1963 Dickerman reinstated the taxon as &quot;Aechmophorus clarkii&quot;, which he defined as the smaller birds, both dark and pale coloured, from Mexico. In 1979 a comprehensive study by Ratti demonstrated the apparent existence of reproductive barriers between different phases of the grebes. In 1986 Dickerman recognised the taxonomic significance of the distinctions between the dark and pale phase, and classified these phases as different subspecies:

*&quot;A. occidentalis&quot; ssp. &quot;occidentalis&quot;, , large, dark morph, from western Canada &amp; United States (California, Utah)
*&quot;A. occidentalis&quot; ssp. &quot;ephemeralis&quot;, - Smaller than the western grebe, dark morph, from north &amp; central Mexico.
*&quot;A. clarkii&quot; ssp. &quot;clarkii&quot;, - Small, pale morph, from north &amp; central Mexico
*&quot;A. clarkii&quot; ssp. &quot;transitionalis&quot;, , large, pale morph, from western Canada &amp; United States (California, Utah)

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the differently colored western grebes (darker and lighter) are different taxa -in a single population in which sympatric speciation somehow persists. These forms were reported to mate according to their own colors and the mixing between dark and light-faced individuals is rare. This type of assortative mating derives from possible isolating mechanisms such as differential responses to advertising calls and spatial distribution. Each of the forms tended to stay closer to their own type, thus making their colony nesting be non-randomly distributed.

By 1992 Storer &amp; Nuechterlein were promoting another concept to the taxon &quot;A. clarkii&quot;, now regarding the pale morphs from the US and Canada to be this taxon (Dickerman&#x27;s &quot;A. occidentalis&quot; ssp. &quot;ephemeralis&quot;).

==Breeding==

Western grebes nest in colonies of hundreds on large inland lakes, sometimes using coastal marshes, in western North America. It has a spectacular courtship display; two birds will rear up and patter across the water&#x27;s surface. Northern birds migrate west to coastal ocean in winter; birds in the southwest and Mexico may be permanent residents. During the breeding season, the birds advertise themselves through ceremonies. Rushing Ceremony, which can be also called as water dance, race or run, is a ceremony that is the most frequent display to form a pair-bond. This is performed in pairs of either both male Western grebes or one male and one female. One of two individuals initiates Rushing, and the paired individual follows immediately and performs in synchrony. The birds lift their wings stiffly to the side and run in an upright position with its head held forward and neck curved. The males seem to perform the rushing together to attract the attention of females, and when one of two males attracts a female from his rushing behavior, a competition arises between males to get the female. One out of two withdraw and the &quot;winning&quot; male mates with the female by performing Rushing together and continue to perform Weed Ceremony.
Weed Ceremony usually precedes the acts of mating and nest building. It is done after the pair is formed, and the ceremony begins as the mates bob their heads in water. Then they dive in place and come back up to surface while holding weed on their beaks. This ceremony is continued until one of the pair flips away its weeds and drops to a normal position in water. They continue their mating with Greeting Ceremony. Greeting ceremony is similar to the form of rushing ceremony and involves dip-shaking, bob-shaking, bob-preening and arch-clucking. Dip-shaking consists of dipping the head in the water and raising it up while rapidly waggling the bill side to side. This involves a low neck posture and conspicuous water splash while bob-shaking does not. These breeding dances are known to be the most elaborated dances in the waterbird species. 
After the breeding, the male Western Grebes feed their mate, thus performing mate feeding behavior. The feeding resembles the feeding of the young by parents, and through the feeding they obtain, females are able to have enough energy to form their eggs. During the incubation period, male and female Western Grebes trade places to incubate their eggs for weeks, and those that are not incubating feed their mate.

==Communication style==
When tending their young, Western grebe parents use different types of vocalization to communicate. Ticking is one of the two and is used as an alarm signal. Parents carry their newly hatched young on their backs, and when the parents make a ticking sound, this is used as a signal for their chicks to hide their heads beneath the back of their parents and be silent. If chicks are greater than 4 weeks of age, they respond to the ticking by swimming or diving away on their own. When making a ticking sound, the callers do not open their mouths, so it is hard to distinguish who is the maker of the sound. The parent who carries the chicks tend to make the ticking sound more often than those that do not, and both of male and female parents are equally likely to tick. Another vocalization noise is clucking, and this signals for food. When a parent clucks, the young respond to it by poking their head out of their parent back where they are on to receive food.

==Reproduction and survival==

The clutch size decreases as the mating season progresses, meaning if the mating is done at the last of days in mating season, the number of offspring produced is smaller. However it is also stated brood size of nests that hatched later in the season is larger than those from earlier, which contradicts previous findings. This may be due to ecological constraints. Ecological constraints also pressure the young, and this may lead to siblicide in the first weeks after hatching, which may explain the brooding differences. Also, Western grebes are sensitive to humans, such that when there is human disturbance near them, the parents leave their nest, leaving their unhatched eggs vulnerable to attacks by predators. This shows the predation or even the seemingly threatening acts result in a decrease of reproduction and survival of the young. Because they are so sensitive, there have been restoration efforts to rebuild the Western grebes&#x27; native habitats, so that they have greater opportunity to reproduce and raise their young without disturbance or threat. The number of Grebes has been slowly declining in the last two decades, not only because of predation, but also because of habitat destruction, with oil spillage being one of the major causes.

==Food and feeding==
This bird dives for carp, herring, mollusks, crabs, and amphibians, such as salamanders. It often peers below the water before diving. Recent observations suggest that the grebe dives at the bottom of the lake. Some smaller fish are impaled much like herons, with the bill, but others are grasped. Most are swallowed underwater, but some are brought to the surface, pinched, and swallowed.

<text>Jonathan L. Zittrain (born December 24, 1969) is an American professor of Internet law and the George Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School. He is also a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, a professor of computer science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and co-founder and director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society. Previously, Zittrain was Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute of the University of Oxford and visiting professor at the New York University School of Law and Stanford Law School. He is the author of &quot;The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It&quot; as well as co-editor of the books, &quot;Access Denied&quot; (MIT Press, 2008), &quot;Access Controlled&quot; (MIT Press, 2010), and &quot;Access Contested&quot; (MIT Press, 2011).

Zittrain works in several intersections of the Internet with law and policy including intellectual property, censorship and filtering for content control, and computer security. He founded a project at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society that develops classroom tools. In 2001 he helped found Chilling Effects, a collaborative archive created by Wendy Seltzer to protect lawful online activity from legal threats. He also served as vice dean for Library and Information Resources at Harvard.

==Early life==

Zittrain is the son of two attorneys, Ruth A. Zittrain and Lester E. Zittrain. In 2004 with Jennifer K. Harrison, Zittrain published &quot;The Torts Game: Defending Mean Joe Greene&quot;, a book the authors dedicated to their parents. His brother, Jeff, is an established Bay Area musician. His sister, Laurie Zittrain Eisenberg, is a scholar of the Arab and Israeli conflict and teaches at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Zittrain, who grew up in the suburb of Churchill outside of Pittsburgh, graduated in 1987 from Shady Side Academy, a private school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He holds a bachelor&#x27;s &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in cognitive science and artificial intelligence from Yale University, 1991, where he was a member of the Yale Political Union, Manuscript Society and Davenport College, a JD &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard Law School, 1995, where he was the winner of the Williston Negotiation Competition, and a Master of Public Administration from Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, 1995.

==Career==

Zittrain clerked for Stephen F. Williams of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and served with the U.S. Department of Justice and, in 1991, with the Department of State, as well as at the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1992 and 1994. He was also a longtime forum administrator, or sysop, for the online service CompuServe, serving for many years as the chief administrator for its private forum for all of its forum administrators.

Zittrain joined the staff of the University of Oxford in September 2005. He held the Chair in Internet Governance and Regulation, was a principal of the Oxford Internet Institute, and was a Professorial Fellow of Keble College, which has developed a particular interest in computer science and public policy. In the United States, he was also the Jack N. &amp; Lillian R. Berkman Visiting Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts and director and founder with Charles Nesson of its Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society. Zittrain was a visiting professor at the Stanford Law School in 2007 and was a visiting professor at New York University School of Law in Manhattan for the spring 2008 semester.

Zittrain taught, or taught with others, Harvard&#x27;s courses on &quot;Cyberlaw: Internet Points of Control&quot;, &quot;The Exploding Internet: Building A Global Commons in Cyberspace&quot;, &quot;Torts&quot;, &quot;Internet &amp; Society: The Technologies and Politics of Control&quot;, &quot;The Law of Cyberspace&quot;, &quot;The Law of Cyberspace: Social Protocols&quot;, &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;, &quot;The Microsoft Case&quot;, and &quot;The High Tech Entrepreneur&quot;. He searched for novel ways to use technology unobtrusively in the classroom at Harvard, founded H2O and used the system to teach his classes. Students are polled, assigned opposing arguments, and use H2O to develop their writing skills. Students enrolled in his &quot;The Internet and Society&quot; class could participate both orally and via the Internet. A teaching fellow seated in the classroom supplied Zittrain with the comments received from students in real time via e-mail as well as through &quot;chat&quot; or &quot;instant message&quot; from students participating in the class while logged into Second Life. (www.secondlife.com)

He has been critical of the process used by ICANN, the International Telecommunication Union and the World Summit on the Information Society. Although he describes their approach as, in some ways, simple and naïve, Zittrain sees more hope in the open Internet Engineering Task Force model and in the ethical code and assumption of good faith that govern Wikipedia. He wrote in 2008, &quot;Wikipedia—with the cooperation of many Wikipedians—has developed a system of self-governance that has many indicia of the rule of law without heavy reliance on outside authority or boundary.&quot;

In 2009 Zittrain was elected to the Internet Society&#x27;s board of trustees for a four-year term. In February 2011 he joined the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In May 2011 Zittrain was made for Federal Communications Commission Distinguished Scholar. In May 2012 he was made for Chair at Federal Communications Commission Open Internet Advisory Committee.

=== Internet filtering ===
Between 2001 and 2003 at Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Center, Zittrain and Benjamin Edelman studied Internet filtering. The OpenNet Initiative (ONI) monitors Internet censorship by national governments. In their tests during 2002, when Google had indexed almost 2.5 billion pages, they found sites blocked, from approximately 100 in France and Germany to 2,000 in Saudi Arabia, and 20,000 in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The authors published a statement of issues and a call for data that year.

Building on the work completed at the Berkman Center, ONI published special reports, case studies, and bulletins beginning in 2004, and as of 2008, offered research on filtering in 40 countries as well as by regions of the world. As of 2016, Zittrain remains a principal investigator at ONI, together with Ronald Deibert of the University of Toronto, John Palfrey, who was previously the executive director of the Berkman Center (now the head of School at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts), and Rafal Rohozinski of the University of Cambridge.

In 2001, Zittrain cofounded Chilling Effects with his students and former students, including its creator and leader, Wendy Seltzer. It monitors cease and desist letters. Google directs its users to Chilling Effects when its search results have been altered at the request of a national government. Since 2002, researchers have been using the clearinghouse (renamed &quot;Lumen&quot; in 2015) to study the use of cease-and-desist letters, primarily looking at DMCA 512 takedown notices, non-DMCA copyright, and trademark claims.

=== Copyright ===
On October 9, 2002, Zittrain and Lawrence Lessig argued a landmark case, known as &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, before the United States Supreme Court. As co-counsel for the plaintiff, they argued that the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) was unconstitutional. The court ruled 7–2 on January 15, 2003, to uphold the CTEA which extended existing copyrights 20 years, from the life of the author plus 50 years, to plus 70 years. In the words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the petitioners did &quot;not challenge the CTEA&#x27;s &#x27;life-plus-70-years&#x27; time span itself. They maintain that Congress went awry not with respect to newly created works, but in enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights.&quot; The court found that the act did &quot;not exceed Congress&#x27; power&quot; and that &quot;CTEA&#x27;s extension of existing and future copyrights does not violate the First Amendment&quot;. In 2003 Zittrain said he was concerned that Congress will hear the same arguments after the 20-year extension passes, and that the Internet is causing a &quot;cultural reassessment of the meaning of copyright&quot;.

=== Security ===

After Zittrain joined the staff at Oxford, Zittrain and John Palfrey at the Berkman Center founded StopBadware.org in 2006 to function as a clearinghouse for what has become proliferation of malware. Borrowing Wikipedia&#x27;s &quot;ethical code that encourages users to do the right thing rather than the required thing&quot;, the organization wished to assign the task of data collection—and not analysis—about malware to Internet users at large. When its scans find dangerous code, Google places StopBadware alerts in its search results and rescans later to determine whether a site thereafter had been cleaned.

One of StopBadware&#x27;s goals is to &quot;preempt&quot; the stifling of the Internet. The founders think that centralized regulation could follow a serious Internet security breach, and that consumers might then choose to purchase closed, centrally managed solutions like tethered appliances that are modified by their vendor rather than owner, or might flee to services in walled gardens. In Zittrain&#x27;s word, &quot;generative&quot; devices and platforms, including the Internet itself, offer an opening forward. In 2007, he cautioned, &quot;...we&#x27;re moving to software-as-service, which can be yanked or transformed at any moment. The ability of your PC to run independent code is an important safety valve.&quot;

Reactions in the &quot;Boston Review&quot; accompanied the publication of his book, &quot;The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It&quot;, in 2008. Support came from David D. Clark and Susan P. Crawford. Criticism ranged from Richard Stallman&#x27;s finding no evidence of a flight to closed systems and his message that software developers need control and software patents must end, to a request for cost-benefit analysis, to the belief that netizenship will not scale to the business world to faith that consumers will buy only open, non-proprietary systems.

Directed by Palfrey and Zittrain, StopBadware received high-level guidance from its advisory board: Vint Cerf of Google, Esther Dyson, George He of Lenovo, Greg Papadopoulos (formerly CTO of Sun Microsystems), and Ari Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The working group, which has included Ben Adida, Scott Bradner, Beau Brendler, Jerry Gregoire, Eric L. Howes, and Nart Villeneuve at various times, frames the project&#x27;s research agenda and methodology and is the body which helps to inform the public about StopBadware&#x27;s work. StopBadware has been supported by AOL, Google, eBay/PayPal, Lenovo, Trend Micro, and VeriSign and its use has been advised by Consumer Reports WebWatch.

=== Stock markets and spam ===
Writing with Laura Freider of Purdue University, in 2008 Zittrain published &quot;Spam Works: Evidence from Stock Touts and Corresponding Market Activity&quot;, in the Hastings Communications and Entertainment Law Journal to document the manipulation of stock prices via spam e-mail. They found evidence that &quot;stocks experience a significantly positive return on days prior to heavy touting via spam&quot; and that &quot;prolific spamming greatly affects the trading volume of a targeted stock&quot;. Apart from transaction costs, in some circumstances the spammer earned over 4% while the average investor who bought on the day of receipt of the spam would lose more than 5% if they sold two days later. Frieder said in 2006 that she knew of no other explanation for their results, but that people do follow the stock tips in their spam e-mail.

=== Facebook ===
In February 2019, Zittrain interviewed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as part of a seminar for students at Harvard on the internet and society. In the interview, Zuckerberg discussed the obligations of Facebook to its users, saying
“The idea of us having a fiduciary relationship with the people who use our services is intuitive... what we’re doing is that we’re acting as fiduciaries and trying to build services for people&quot;

== ChatGPT ==
In December 2024, Ars Technica reported that the popular chatbot ChatGPT was filtering out responses involving certain people&#x27;s names, including Zittrain&#x27;s, &quot;likely due to complaints about hallucinated responses&quot;.

&quot;OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT is more than just an AI language model with a fancy interface. It&#x27;s a system consisting of a stack of AI models and content filters that make sure its outputs don&#x27;t embarrass OpenAI or get the company into legal trouble when its bot occasionally makes up potentially harmful facts about people. Recently, that reality made the news when people discovered that the name &quot;David Mayer&quot; breaks ChatGPT. 404 Media also discovered that the names &quot;Jonathan Zittrain&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Turley&quot; caused ChatGPT to cut conversations short. And we know another name, likely the first, that started the practice last year: &quot;Brian Hood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica/chatgpt-grind&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - Ars Technica&lt;ref name=&quot;techcrunch/chatgpt-david-mayer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - TechCrunch

<doc id="213199" wikidata="Q266568" url="?curid=213199" title="Heather Mills">
<text>Heather Anne Mills (born 12 January 1968) is an English former model, businesswoman and animal rights activist.

Mills first came to public attention in 1993 when she was a model and was run over by a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation of her left leg below the knee, but she continued to model using a prosthetic limb and later sold her story to the tabloid journal &quot;News of the World&quot;.

She began a relationship with Paul McCartney in 2000. They married in June 2002 and Mills gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney on 28 October 2003. They separated in 2006, and finalised their divorce in 2008.

After her marriage to McCartney, Mills became involved in animal rights advocacy and as of 2024 is a patron of Viva! and Viva! Health. She is also vice-president of the Limbless Association.

==Early life==

Mills was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, to John &#x27;Mark&#x27; Francis Mills, a former British paratrooper, and his wife, Beatrice Mary (née Finlay) Mills, who was the daughter of a colonel in the British Army. John was adopted at the age of seven and grew up in Brighton, where his adoptive parents had a grocery shop. His adoptive father also worked as a mechanic for a Grand Prix racing team. Beatrice was born in India during World War II, and was educated at English boarding schools. John and Beatrice met at Newcastle University, and were married against the wishes of her father, who did not attend the wedding and only saw his daughter once more before he died.

Beatrice spoke several languages and played the piano, while Mark played banjo and guitar, liked photography (winning an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; award) and took part in numerous sports. He was very fond of animals (working for the RSPCA for a time), and Heather remembered her family always having a dog and a cat, as well as once having a pet goose and a white nanny goat that was allowed to roam the house owned by Mark&#x27;s parents in Libanus, near Brecon.

The Mills family spent their holidays in Libanus, and also lived there for a time. When Heather was six years old, the family moved north to Alnwick, in Northumberland, but relocated shortly afterwards to a block of flats in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and then on to Cockshott Farm, in Rothbury, Northumberland. Heather attended Usworth Grange Primary school, and then Usworth Comprehensive School in Washington. She visited Usworth Comprehensive in 2003, as guest of honour at a prize-giving event, and to support the school against plans for its closure.

Heather later wrote that, when she was eight years old, she and her next-door neighbour were kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a swimming pool attendant. But her neighbour, Margaret Ambler, alleged that Heather&#x27;s story was &quot;nothing what she made it out to be&quot;, that Heather was never a victim, and the pool attendant did not commit suicide, as she had written. Although having received a letter from Heather offering £10,000 to stop a court case, Ambler complained that the story had caused her deep discomfort by bringing the incident to national attention, so she sued for breach of privacy, accepting an out-of-court settlement of £5,000 in compensation and £54,000 legal costs.

Beatrice left home when Heather was nine years old, to live with &quot;Crossroads&quot; actor Charles Stapley, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister Fiona, in the care of their father John. Heather once said that John threw Shane against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons; the window broke and Shane had to be taken to hospital, where John explained that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: &quot;Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you&#x27;d rather do that than face a beating from your father.&quot; John disputed his daughters&#x27; allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.

==London and modelling==

When Heather&#x27;s father was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister Fiona to live with their mother and her partner in Clapham, south London. Shane went to Brighton to live with his paternal grandparents. Heather later wrote that at the age of 15, she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During Heather&#x27;s stated period of homelessness, her school records indicated that she and Fiona were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June that year, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. Heather remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, &quot;there&#x27;s no hope for her at all&quot;, and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. 

Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed &quot;never to work for anyone else again&quot;. She wrote in her 1995 autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: &quot;Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me her father was dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop,&quot; which Guy said was worth £20,000. Heather admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.

Alfie Karmal, the son of a Palestinian father and Greek mother, was ten years older than Mills when they met in 1986. Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery, and paid for cosmetic surgery to her breasts. Karmal, who had moved into the computer industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was unsuccessful. In 1987, Mills went to live in Paris, telling Karmal that a cosmetics company had given her a modelling contract, but instead she became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a nude photo session for a stills-only German sex education manual called &quot;Die Freuden der Liebe&quot; (&quot;The Joys of Love&quot;).

After returning to London, Mills asked Karmal to marry her. Karmal said yes, but on one condition: &quot;I told her I couldn&#x27;t marry her until she did something about her compulsive lying, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eight weeks. She admitted she had a problem and said it was because she&#x27;d been forced to lie as a child by her father.&quot; Although Mills proposed to Karmal, she later said that every man she has been out with &quot;has asked me to marry him within a week&quot;. The couple married on 6 May 1989. While married to Karmal, she suffered two ectopic pregnancies, so in 1990, Karmal paid for her to go on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex-wife (with whom Mills had become friends), but Mills ended up living with her Slovenian ski instructor, Miloš Pogačar, shortly before the Croatian War began. Mills set up a refugee crisis centre in London, helping over 20 people to escape the war. She drove to deliver donations to Croatia, taking modelling assignments in Austria on the way to pay for the trip, later saying that she &quot;worked on the front line in a war zone in the former Yugoslavia for two years where there were mines everywhere that weren&#x27;t marked.&quot; Karmal and Mills were divorced in 1991, and Mills was engaged to Raffaele Mincione (a bond dealer for the Industrial Bank of Japan) in 1993.

==Accident and amputation==

On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione walked to the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while crossing Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, () even though the police motorcyclist was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the &quot;News of the World&quot;, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust, which existed from 2000 to 2004 and delivered prosthetic limbs to people (particularly children) who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, in 2002.

Mills booked herself into the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills discovered that she had been previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, and because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994, and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the daytime television programme &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot;. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia&#x27;s prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.

With the help of ghostwriter Pamela Cockerill, Mills wrote a book about her experience, entitled &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; (1995), which was republished in the United States as &quot;A Single Step&quot; (2002). Extracts from &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; were serialised in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in March 2000. Mills handed all the proceeds from the book to Adopt-A-Minefield, and stated that it was one of &#x27;the few charities where 100% of their donations goes to clear minefields and survivor assistance&#x27;. In 1995, Mills became engaged to British media executive Marcus Stapleton after being together for 16 days; she was then engaged to documentary filmmaker Chris Terrill in 1999, after 12 days in Cambodia, where they were making a film about landmines. Mills ended their relationship five days before their planned wedding day, later telling friends in the media that she had called the wedding off because Terrill was gay, an MI6 agent, and that his mission was to sabotage her anti-landmine work. Terrill had once told Mills that he had been interviewed by the intelligence services when he was thinking of a career with the Foreign Office, but later said: &quot;I soon realised that Heather had a somewhat elastic relationship with the truth, which she was able to stretch impressively sometimes.&quot; Terrill also claims that although Mills said she was a vegetarian at the time, she often cooked her speciality dish, Lancashire hotpot, (which contains lamb) for him; and her former sister-in-law, Dianna Karmal, claims that Mills became a vegetarian after meeting McCartney.

In 2003, the Open University awarded Mills an honorary doctorate for her philanthropic work on behalf of amputees. She continues to campaign, in addition to promoting the distribution of prostheses around the world, and has been involved with the development of the Heather Mills McCartney Cosmesis, which gives amputees in America the chance to wear a Dorset Orthopaedic cosmesis without having to travel to the UK. Mills is also vice-president of the Limbless Association. In 2004, Mills received a &quot;Children in Need&quot; award from the annual International Charity Gala in Düsseldorf; and in the same year, the University of California, Irvine gave her their 2004 Human Security Award and created the Heather Mills McCartney Fellowship in Human Security to support graduate students conducting research on pressing human security issues. She is a former Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Association Adopt-A-Minefield programme.

==Relationship with Paul McCartney==

Mills met McCartney at the Dorchester Hotel, during the Pride of Britain Awards event on 20 May 1999, which McCartney had attended to present an award to an animal rights activist. Mills presented the Outstanding Bravery Award to Helen Smith, also making an appeal on behalf of the Heather Mills Health Trust. McCartney also presented an award dedicated to his recently late wife, Linda McCartney, and later talked to Mills about donating to her charity, later giving her £150,000 (). In the autumn of 1999, Mills and her sister Fiona recorded &quot;VO!CE&quot;, a song they wrote to raise funds for Mills&#x27;s charity. After recording the song in Greece, where Fiona lived, running the independent label Coda Records, the sisters stayed overnight at McCartney&#x27;s estate in Peasmarsh, Sussex, in early November, where McCartney added vocals to the song.

Having sparked the interest of the tabloids about his appearances with Mills at events, McCartney appeared publicly beside her at a party in January 2000 to celebrate her 32nd birthday. While on holiday in the Lake District, McCartney proposed to Mills on 23 July 2001, giving her a £15,000 diamond and sapphire ring he had purchased in Jaipur, India, while they were there on holiday.

===Marriage===
Mills and McCartney were married on 11 June 2002, four years after his first wife Linda had died of breast cancer. The McCartney–Mills wedding was an elaborate ceremony at Castle Leslie, in the village of Glaslough in County Monaghan, Ireland. A song specially composed by McCartney, called &quot;Heather&quot;, was played; this had been included on the 2001 album &quot;Driving Rain&quot;.

Mills said that she liked to cook traditional vegetarian Christmas dinners for McCartney and as many of his family as possible, and that McCartney had encouraged her to give up her self-confessed addiction to chocolate and Snickers bars. When asked by chat-show host Larry King in 2003 how life was with McCartney, Mills replied, &quot;Great, really great&quot;, but also said that she was surprised at how tidy McCartney was: &quot;He always cleans up before the cleaner comes. So I said for a while that&#x27;s crazy, but what&#x27;s good is if I cook the dinner, he&#x27;ll clean everything up.&quot;

In 2003, McCartney played a concert in Red Square, Russia. Vladimir Putin gave the couple a tour of the Kremlin. McCartney later said that Mills&#x27;s contribution was giving him an acrylic fingernail to protect a finger on his left hand that often bled after playing guitar. McCartney stated that he felt inspired by Mills, as &quot;Being in love with her makes me want to write songs&quot;, such as &quot;Too Much Rain&quot; for the album &quot;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&quot; (2005), and &quot;See Your Sunshine&quot; (&#x27;She makes me feel glad/I want her so bad&#x27;) for his album &quot;Memory Almost Full&quot; (2007). Another composition inspired by Mills was used as the bridal march at their wedding.

===Parenthood===
During an appearance on the chat show &quot;Parkinson&quot;, on 22 February 2003, host Michael Parkinson asked if it was because of McCartney that Mills did not give any interviews, and she replied that she wanted to protect McCartney, his children, and their privacy. At the same time, she said that her previous ectopic pregnancies had damaged her fertility, and that her chances of getting pregnant were small, although the couple announced in May that they were expecting their first child. Mills gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney on 28 October 2003 at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in St John&#x27;s Wood; she was named after Mills&#x27;s mother and McCartney&#x27;s aunt. It was later revealed that Mills had suffered a miscarriage in the first year of their marriage. Mills was invited by Larry King to interview Paul Newman, which was broadcast by CNN on 17 April 2004. McCartney had arranged for Newman to be interviewed by Mills, but critical reactions were mixed. Mills appeared on other television programmes, such as BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and ITV&#x27;s GMTV, and persuaded McCartney to join her on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;

===Separation ===
After some time apart, Mills and McCartney separated on 17 May 2006. In November 2007, Mills gave a number of interviews, saying that the breakdown of the marriage was caused by her husband&#x27;s daughter, Stella, whom she described as &quot;jealous&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. Mills had previously talked with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, saying Stella had once issued a press release confirming how much she liked her new stepmother, although Stella&#x27;s publicist denied that such a statement had ever been issued.

After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated she would represent herself in the upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills said that she had been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner, and psychologist to McCartney. 

McCartney&#x27;s lawyers studied Mills&#x27;s book: &quot;Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing&quot; (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for &quot;Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we&#x27;ve got that agreement. It&#x27;s thoughtfulness.&quot; Mills&#x27;s father reconciled with her, after meeting her and McCartney when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it &quot;took guts to represent yourself at the High Court&quot;, and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be &quot;torn to shreds&quot; by McCartney&#x27;s lawyers.

===Divorce===

The case was heard in court 34 at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. At the start of the proceedings, Mills asked for £125 million, but McCartney offered £15.8 million. Before the court case, Mills had employed the accountancy firm Lee and Allen to examine McCartney&#x27;s publishing company, business assets, and properties, claiming that she had a tape recording of McCartney admitting his true worth, but the presiding judge, Mr Justice Bennett, based his decision on a forensic valuation of McCartney&#x27;s finances completed by accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.

The hearing took six days, finishing on 18 February 2008, and the judgement was made public on 17 March that year. Mills was eventually awarded a lump sum of £16.5 million, plus assets of £7.8 million, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3 million () plus payments of £35,000 per annum for a nanny and school costs for their child. In his judgement, Mr Justice Bennett stated:

Mr Justice Bennett said in his ruling that there was no evidence of Mills&#x27;s &quot;charitable giving&quot; in her tax returns, ridiculed her claim to have been McCartney&#x27;s business partner as &quot;make-believe&quot; and said she was a &quot;volatile and explosive&quot; personality who could be her &quot;own worst enemy&quot;. He also rejected her argument that she had rekindled McCartney&#x27;s &quot;professional flame&quot; after he had lost his first wife, Linda, to cancer. 

Regarding her career, the judge said:

In anger at the judgement, Mills poured a jug of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney&#x27;s solicitor, in the courtroom.

The preliminary divorce was granted on 12 May, and the decree absolute became final a week later.

During their marriage, Mills was known as Heather Mills McCartney, but after her divorce, she reverted to Heather Mills, although as the former wife of a knight she is entitled to the title &quot;Lady McCartney&quot; unless she remarries. In 2012, she was called &quot;Heather Mills&quot; and &quot;Ms Mills&quot; in her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry and its subsequent report, though Lord Justice Leveson had referred to &quot;Lady McCartney&quot; earlier in the proceedings.

Following her divorce from Paul McCartney, Mills bought a house in Robertsbridge, East Sussex, in 2007.

==Media image==

Mills&#x27;s relationship with McCartney triggered considerable media interest. After her divorce, the attitude of the British media was hostile. Mills frequently accused the press of misquoting her and of using material out of context to give a negative impression of her, telling the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; that the claims that she had married McCartney for his money were more hurtful than losing her leg. Mills has been accused by several newspapers of having embellished her life story. 

A journalist with the same name, Heather Mills, at that time working for &quot;The Observer&quot;, accused Mills of impersonating her for over a year in the late 1990s, showing people cuttings of articles the journalist had written, which helped Mills secure a job presenting &quot;The General&quot;, a BBC television programme about Southampton General Hospital. 

It was reported that she had been nominated for the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize because the Heather Mills Health Trust had donated thousands of prosthetic limbs to landmine victims, but the nomination cannot be confirmed because the identities of nominees remain secret for 50 years.

Mills&#x27;s stepfather disputed her statement that her mother had nearly lost a leg in a car crash, after Mills said: &quot;her leg was only hanging on by a tiny flap of skin and flesh...miraculously the surgeons managed to insert a metal plate and re-attach it&quot;. Stapley said that Mills&#x27;s mother had suffered a leg injury after a car crash, but recovered and was &quot;a keen tennis player&quot; and that Mills &quot;is simply a very confused woman for whom reality and fantasy have become blurred&quot;.

Mills said that she had once been asked to stand for parliament by the three main political parties, and had been offered a peerage in 2001 (to become Baroness Mills) by the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and a certain &#x27;Lord MacDonald&#x27;. An ITV documentary (&quot;McCartney vs McCartney: The Ex Files&quot;) interviewed three men named Lord MacDonald, but not one of them could remember ever meeting Mills. British journalist Jasper Gerard, to whom Mills made the claims, also says she told him that she had cancelled a meeting with US president Bill Clinton in case her endorsement affected a US election outcome. Mills stated that she was once awarded the title of &quot;Outstanding Young Person of the Year&quot; by the British Chambers of Commerce, but did not challenge newspapers after they discovered there was no such award.

In October 2006, Mills announced her intention to sue the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspapers. All the newspapers said that their stories &quot;were obtained by proper methods and in accordance with good journalistic practice&quot;. &quot;The Sun&quot;, which regularly refers to Mills as &quot;Mucca&quot; – a play on McCartney&#x27;s nickname &quot;Macca&quot; – responded by asking her to &quot;tick the boxes&quot; on a series of allegations the newspaper had made, stating: &quot;It is not clear what exactly she plans to sue us about&quot;. Underneath the questions, &quot;The Sun&quot; listed six allegations about her, with a blank box beside each of them. The words beside the boxes read: &quot;Hooker, Liar, Porn Star, Fantasist, Trouble Maker, Shoplifter&quot;.

Later that year, Mills told the BBC that she had received death threats, and on 17 December, police stated that a &quot;non-specific threat&quot; had been made to her safety. This led to more criticism that she was calling out the emergency services too often. Three months later, Chief Superintendent Kevin Moore of Sussex Police, said that Mills was running &quot;the risk of being treated as the little boy who cried wolf&quot;, and added, &quot;We do have to respond to a disproportionate high volume of calls from Heather Mills McCartney because of the situations she finds herself in, and this is regrettable as it takes officers away from other policing matters.&quot; Mills responded that the police had told her to contact them whenever she was being harassed.

During a five-day trial in July 2007, it was revealed that Mills had been physically assaulted in Brighton, by Jay Kaycappa, a notorious paparazzo trying to photograph Mills while on shifts for a national newspaper and a regional press agency. Kaycappa, who had 132 previous criminal convictions (including perverting the course of justice, obtaining property by deception, driving offences and using ten aliases), was found guilty and sentenced to a 140-hour community order and ordered to pay Mills £100, plus £1,000 court costs. Kaycappa later won an appeal against the conviction after the Crown did not respond to the appeal because of difficulties in bringing witnesses to give evidence.

During several interviews in October that year, Mills accused the media of giving her &quot;worse press than a paedophile or a murderer&quot;. She also criticised the media over the treatment of Diana, Princess of Wales – who Mills described as having been &quot;chased and killed&quot; by paparazzi – and of Kate McCann. Immediately before her giving these interviews, Phil Hall (a former &quot;News of the World&quot; editor) quit as her PR adviser.

In 2008, a survey commissioned by &quot;Marketing&quot; magazine showed Mills as one of the top-four most-hated celebrity women, along with Amy Winehouse, Victoria Beckham and Kerry Katona. (The fifth most-hated person was Simon Cowell, who ironically was also among the top five all-male most-loved celebrities.) In December of that year, the Channel 4 television comedy &quot;Star Stories&quot; broadcast a satirical mockumentary of Mills&#x27;s life story from her point of view. In 2009, after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK about being lied about in the press, five British tabloids (&quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;News of the World&quot;, &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;) publicly apologised to Mills about printing false, hurtful or defamatory stories about her. Another tabloid (&quot;Daily Mail&quot;), sent a private letter of apology. Mills has complained that over 4,400 abusive articles about her have been published.

===Criticism of press coverage===

In 2002, Mills accepted damages of £50,000 plus costs from the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; after a false report that the Charity Commission had investigated her about the money she raised for the Indian Earthquake Victims Appeal in 2001. The extent and nature of the British press coverage of Mills has been criticised, as in May 2003, when &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Matt Seaton wrote a piece declaring: &quot;There is little that is edifying in the symbolic lynching of Heather. The poisonous judgmentalism that drives it, is in the worst tradition of small town gossip. It is prurient, spiteful, hypocritical, and we should cry &#x27;shame&#x27; on it.&quot; Publicist Mark Borkowski wrote in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, on 23 March 2008: &quot;Not since the cult of Myra Hindley have we encountered so much vitriol aimed at one woman.&quot; Feminist writer Natasha Walter has compared the coverage to that of Britney Spears. Terence Blacker wrote that public figures who are young, female, pretty and fair-haired, are often subjected to public bullying, which is explained as &quot;intense media interest&quot;, such as Diana, Princess of Wales, Paula Yates, Ulrika Jonsson and Mills.

Kira Cochrane, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote of &quot;every misogynist epithet available&quot; being used against Mills. &quot;She has somehow become the vessel through which it is acceptable for both pundits and the public to express their very worst feelings about women.&quot; Joan Smith, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, said that newspaper &quot;bullies love a weakling&quot;, quoting the front-page headline of the British tabloid newspaper &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; which read &quot;Lady Liar&quot;, and &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper writing &quot;Pornocchio&quot; over Mills&#x27;s face (in reference to Mills&#x27;s past saucy photographs, and the nose of Pinocchio getting longer when he lied). Smith further said Mills had &quot;dreamt of becoming the wife of a famous man, but did not realise that he had fantasies of his own, marrying an attractive younger woman when he hadn&#x27;t got over the loss of his first wife. Mills behaved foolishly when the marriage failed, but she does not deserve the treatment she has had in the mass-market press. It is merciless bullying of an unstable, vulnerable woman.&quot; In 2009, Mills reported that a bogus charity had been set up to extract information about her marriage. News Corp, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is alleged to have set up the sting. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran the headline &quot;Macca marriage to Heather was mistake of the decade&quot;, following an interview that McCartney gave to &quot;Q magazine&quot;. McCartney immediately moved to deny this statement, and then went on to publicly print the original transcript on his official website to prove that the article in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was false.

Celia Larkin, writing on 12 February 2012 in the Irish &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, wrote: &quot;There was something very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above the roar of the Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what&#x27;s written about her, you&#x27;ll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn&#x27;t lie down under the weight of McCartney&#x27;s fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. &#x27;Heather Mills has Melt Down&#x27; screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Carole Malone of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live television, in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?&quot;

===Phone hacking and Leveson Inquiry===
On 5 May 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Mills had met with officers from the London Metropolitan Police who showed her evidence, seized from private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, which could form the basis of a claim against the &quot;News of The World&quot; for breach of privacy over alleged phone-hacking. Mills&#x27;s name and private mobile phone number were listed in Mulcaire&#x27;s notes, along with those of her friends and associates. Mills later alleged that a journalist working for the Mirror Group had admitted to her in 2001 that he had hacked her phone.

Appearing as a witness at the Leveson Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of McCartney&#x27;s phone calls or answerphone messages, and had ever played it to Piers Morgan or &quot;anybody else&quot;; she replied, &quot;Never ever.&quot; Giving evidence in December 2011, Morgan – who bragged in a newspaper column for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 2006 about hearing the message – refused to say who had played him the recorded message of the call, saying he was protecting a source. Mills told the inquiry that Morgan was &quot;a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years and would have relished telling the inquiry if I had played a personal voicemail message to him&quot;.

In the official findings of his Inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson said Morgan&#x27;s testimony under oath on phone-hacking was &quot;utterly unpersuasive. This was not, in any sense at all, a convincing answer&quot;, adding &quot;what it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it&quot;.

=== TV game show appearances ===

Mills was one of the celebrity performers competing on the US television series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2007, with dancing partner Jonathan Roberts. On 21 December 2009, she was revealed as one of the contestants on the fifth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, being paired with Matt Evers.

==Activism==

In 2005, Mills became a patron of the British animal rights organisation Viva!, and the Vegetarian and Vegan Foundation (now Viva! Health), which are both run by Juliet Gellatley.

In March 2006, McCartney and Mills travelled to Canada to bring attention to the country&#x27;s annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government to put an end to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. McCartney and Mills protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.

Mills&#x27;s relationship with PETA ended in 2007, when McCartney&#x27;s daughter Mary was chosen in her place.

In 2008, an old video surfaced of Mills wearing a mink coat that she had owned in 1989, but explained to reporters that she had bought it years before becoming involved in animal rights organisations or vegetarianism. Although she had separated from McCartney, Mills said: &quot;It&#x27;s only since I met Paul [McCartney] that I really got to understand how vegetarianism not only benefits your health massively but also makes a huge difference to the planet, to animals, and to feeding the world.&quot; In August 2008, she was honoured by the organisation Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM), with the Celebrity Animal Activist Award, presented at the Animal Rights National Conference.

After her divorce, Mills pledged to give a &#x27;large portion&#x27; of her £24.3 million divorce settlement to Adopt-A-Minefield, but as of September 2008, the charity had not received any of this money.

In June 2008, Mills was asked to talk at a New York party about the cruelty of puppy farms and to promote her book about animals, but was angry about the guests talking during her speech, saying: &#x27;Listen up at the back. I haven&#x27;t been up for 24 hours and flown here from London to be ignored.&#x27; Mills&#x27;s publicist of four years, Michele Elyzabeth, stopped representing her on 25 July that year.

Mills was an executive producer for the 2024 British documentary film &quot;I Could Never Go Vegan&quot;.

==Commercial interests==

On 4 July 2009, Mills opened a vegan restaurant called VBites at Hove Lagoon, East Sussex. Mills was quoted as saying that she intended it to be the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants. While promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she had been very proactive in the building stages and that now it was open, would give as much time to it as she could, working it around her charity work. In May 2013, she sold the restaurant premises to local musician Norman Cook (better-known as Fatboy Slim); the restaurant is now &quot;Big Beach Cafe&quot; at Hove Lagoon on Hove Seafront.&lt;ref name=&quot;theargus.co.uk/18985800&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greatbritishlife/22564615&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Mills opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton which closed in September 2017.

Also in 2009, Mills bought the vegan food company Redwood Foods, which she would rename to VBites Foods. The company in Corby, Northamptonshire, sold 50 meat-free products under the brand names Cheatin&#x27;, VegiDeli and Cheezly. In 2014, products sold under the brand &#x27;Wot no Dairy&#x27; were recalled, because it was revealed that they contained traces of dairy products and consequently could possibly cause adverse effects for those with dairy product intolerance.

In May 2018, Mills bought the 180,000 sq ft former Walkers Crisps factory in Peterlee, County Durham, which had closed in 2017.

In 2019, Mills bought the 55-acre site of a former Coty factory in Seaton Delaval (10 miles north of Newcastle on Tyne), which closed in 2018. Mills said that it would offer vegan businesses manufacturing, storage and office space. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Mills said it would make the region a &#x27;world centre for the creation of planet-rescuing ideas&#x27; and the &#x27;northern powerhouse for the brightest vegan minds&#x27;.&quot;

In July 2023, Mills bought the Boston, Lincolnshire, factory and equipment of vegan food manufacturer Plant &amp; Bean for £2.9m, after Plant &amp; Bean went into administration at the end of May 2023.

Mills&#x27; company VBites went into administration on 11 December 2023. At the time it was operating two factories: one in Corby, and one in Peterlee.

<text>Eton fives, a derivative of the British game of fives, is a handball game, similar to Rugby fives, played as doubles in a three-sided court. The object is to force the other team to fail to hit the ball &#x27;up&#x27; off the front wall, using any variety of wall or ledge combinations as long as the ball is played &#x27;up&#x27; before it bounces twice. Eton fives is an uncommon sport, with only a few courts, most of them as part of the facilities of the independent schools in the United Kingdom.

== Origins ==
Eton fives is a sport developed in the late 19th century at Eton College. The shape of the court used now is taken from the chapel at Eton College, where A. C. Ainger and some of his friends developed a simple set of rules in 1877. The rules have been modified since that time to those seen now, but the essential components are still the same and are described below in the &#x27;Rules&#x27; section.

Much earlier than the formalisation of Eton fives, a court was built in the grounds of Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar School, now Warminster School, in 1787, the School&#x27;s 80th year. It is claimed that Thomas Arnold a pupil here took the game with him to Rugby School leading to Rugby Fives. The court at Warminster School survives but is rarely used.

City of Norwich School (formerly Eaton (City of Norwich) School) is possibly unique in being a state-run comprehensive school which houses two fives courts. Matches have been undertaken on the courts between Eaton &amp; Eton, but in the 1990s the courts were used as car parks for teaching staff. However since 2013 one of the courts has been used for fives, whilst the other is now a boiler room.

Dale Vargas, a retired teacher at Harrow School where he was master in charge of Fives, has written and published a history of Eton fives. The book is titled &quot;Eton Fives: A History.&quot; The co-author is Peter Knowles.

== Court ==
An Eton fives court consists of three walls, with the left-hand wall interrupted by a buttress approximately halfway up the court. There are also two levels to the court, the front being around six inches higher than the back half of the playing area. On the front wall is a vertical black line about three-quarters of a metre from the right wall; this is used during the serve and return process detailed later. There is a diagonal ledge that circumvents the entire &#x27;top-step&#x27; at about chest height; it is this ledge which the ball has to hit or go above to be &#x27;up&#x27;. Below this ledge, at knee height, is a horizontal ledge about two inches wide, and which is only present on the &#x27;top-step&#x27;. This is merely here because of the origins of Eton fives as the ledge is present at the chapel in Eton College.

The diagonal ledge drops vertically at the edge of the &#x27;top-step&#x27; and then returns to normal at a slightly lower height on the bottom step, running to the back of the court. At the back are brick columns that jut out slightly into the court, which vary in width from school to school, these &quot;buttresses&quot; are usually anywhere from 2 – 10 inches in width. Shots very rarely hit this part of the court, but once they do it is usually very effective for winning a point. Between the buttress and the top step is a small rectangular area about 10 cm sq, often referred to as the &#x27;pepper pot&#x27;. If the ball is hit into the pepper pot it is almost always point-winning. Each of the courts at varying schools differ in some way, leaving room to modify how your school&#x27;s courts are built to a certain extent. In this way the &#x27;home team&#x27; will often have an advantage over a visiting side because of their knowledge of the court&#x27;s characteristics and layout.

== Rules ==
Fives has many rules that are similar to other court type games, such as tennis or squash:

# The ball is only allowed to hit the floor once (note: it can bounce off as many ledges or hit the walls any number of times).
# The pair whose turn it is to hit the ball &#x27;up&#x27; must do so without the ball hitting the ground.
# You can only use your gloves to return the ball, no legs, arms, wrists, feet or any other appendages can be utilised in this way (similar to tennis and squash where you can only use your racket).
# You can only hit the ball once before it must go up, and therefore only one member of the pair is able to hit the ball during the return of a shot (i.e., no Volleyball style &#x27;set-ups&#x27; can be used).
# A pair can only score when it is their serve.

However, there are a large number of rules unique to the game of Eton fives:

# All games are played to 12. However, if the score is 10–10, or 11–11 the game can be &#x27;set&#x27; so that you play to a higher number.
# The start of a point comes from a serve, and then a shot called a &#x27;cut&#x27; is used to try and stop the server or his/her partner being able to hit the ball back.
# The cut must go to the right of the black line on the front wall (note: if the ball hits the right hand wall and then hits the front wall to the left of the black line this is regarded as &#x27;in&#x27;). If the ball goes to the left of the black line a &#x27;Black Guard&#x27; is in effect and if the serving pair hit the ball down they do not lose the point; it is treated as a &#x27;let&#x27;.
# When a pair reaches 11 points, the server must stand with at least one foot on the bottom step when they serve. From that point they cannot move until the &#x27;cutter&#x27; has hit to ball. This is called &#x27;step&#x27;.
# On &#x27;step&#x27; the cutter can hit the ball anywhere on the front wall, it does not have to go to the right of the black line.

== A point ==
A point operates thus: At the start of the play, the server stands between the buttress and the front wall. The receiver, known as a &#x27;cutter&#x27;, stands in the backcourt, along with the other two players (the cutter&#x27;s partner stands behind him, with the server&#x27;s partner in the bottom right corner). The server throws the ball high so it bounces off the front and right wall, landing after the step and roughly in the middle of the court (note: different players like the ball to bounce at different points in order to get varying types of spin on their &#x27;cuts&#x27;). There are no rules about the serve but as a cutter can reject any serve, there is little benefit in a serve which can not be easily hit. The cutter will then often play the ball overarm so that it is &#x27;up&#x27;, usually into the corner, so that the ball hits the right then the front wall and goes straight back at the server. The best way to follow up this &#x27;cut&#x27; is to follow the ball in and stand on the step, ready for a volley if the server returns it high. From here the cutter and the server will try to volley the ball, while the other two players will sweep up anything that they miss. This continues until the ball is either hit &#x27;down&#x27; or out of the court.

== Competitions ==
There are now a huge number of championships and tournaments that take place at various times throughout the fives season.

The Kinnaird Cup is an open tournament for any age. Over the years it has become more and more competitive, and is now the most sought after trophy of them all. Other tournaments include the Northern Championships and the Eton fives Association (EFA) Trophy, where teams of 6 players (3 pairs) compete against one another in one-set matches.

The Schools National Championships are the highlight of the season for school players across the country. The location of the championships changes every year between Eton, Shrewsbury and Repton. There are championships for every age group, ranging from the Under 10s to the Open (Under 18s). Within these championships are the Main Tournament, Plate A and Plate B.

== Kinnaird winners ==
The following have won eight or more Kinnairds:
* 19 – Tom Dunbar (Harrovian): 2002–04, 06–07, 09, 11–23
* 13 – Seb Cooley (Olavian): 2011–23
* 11 – John Reynolds (Citizen): 1981–91
* 10 – Brian Matthews (Citizen): 1981–90
* 9 – Tony Hughes (Edwardian): 1958, 63, 65–68, 71, 73, 75
* 8 – Robin Mason (Edwardian): 1993–95, 98–99, 2002–04
* 8 – Gordon Campbell (Edwardian): 1958, 65–68, 71, 73, 75

== Keepers of Fives ==
The &quot;Keeper of Fives&quot; is the equivalent to the captain of any particular sport at any particular establishment the sport is played at. It is one of a number of minor officer positions to be held at Eton College.

==List of courts==
Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, St Bartholomews School, Newbury, St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, City of Norwich School and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, Barnet enjoy being the only non-private schools with Eton fives courts in the UK. Other schools with Fives courts include Alleyns School, Aldenham School, Shrewsbury School, Highgate School, Harrow, Berkhamsted School, Cranleigh School, Sunningdale School, St Bees School, Eton College, King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, Westminster School, Wolverhampton Grammar School, Marlborough College, Oswestry School, Oakham School, Wrekin College, Repton School and Ipswich School, University College School; consequently, it has been primarily the preserve of their students and alumni.

The only known court to be owned by a private individual in the UK is on the Torry Hill estate in Kent.

The University of Cambridge, St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, Bryanston School, Charterhouse School, Lancing College, Emanuel School and Summerfields Prep school house the only indoor Eton fives courts in England, with three Rugby Fives courts being part of a Fives and Squash court complex at the former, which together form the Jock Burnet Fives centre.

However, the first real public courts have recently opened in the Westway Sports &amp; Fitness Centre in London&#x27;s White City, marking a possible change in fortunes for Eton fives as a minor sport.

Public school Rydal Penrhos currently has the only Eton fives courts in Wales.

Only a few courts exist outside Britain, most notably at Geelong Grammar School in Australia (the school is often referred to as the &#x27;Eton of Australia&#x27;); there are also courts in Geneva, Zürich, Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz, Switzerland, St. Paul&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, India (the school is often referred to as the &#x27;Eton of the East&#x27;) and Malay College Kuala Kangsar, Malaysia, while two brand-new courts have recently been completed in the South of France, in the village of Grillon, Provence.

<doc id="213202" wikidata="Q1056415" url="?curid=213202" title="Monterey Jack">
<text>Monterey Jack, sometimes shortened to Jack, is a Californian white, semi-hard cheese made using cow&#x27;s milk, with a mild flavor and slight sweetness. Originating in Monterey, on the Central Coast of California, the cheese has been called &quot;a vestige of Spanish rule in the early nineteenth century, deriving from a Franciscan monastic style of farmer&#x27;s cheese.&quot;

In addition to being eaten by itself, it is frequently marbled with Colby to produce Colby-Jack, or with yellow cheddar to produce &quot;cheddar-Jack&quot;. &quot;Pepper Jack&quot; is a version flavored with chili peppers and herbs. &quot;Dry Jack&quot; is a harder cheese with a longer aging time.

== Origins ==
In its earliest form, Monterey Jack was made by 18th-century Franciscan friars of Monterey, Alta California. California land speculator and businessman David Jacks sold the cheese commercially. He produced a mild white cheese that came to be known eponymously as &quot;Jacks&#x27; Cheese&quot; and eventually &quot;Monterey Jack&quot;. Other ranchers in the area likewise produced the cheese, among them Andrew Molera, who built a successful dairy operation in Big Sur and whose Monterey Jack was especially well regarded.

==Aging==
Although most of the softer varieties found in American supermarkets are aged for only one month, &quot;Dry Jack&quot; is a harder variety aged for up to 24 months.

== Uses ==
The cheese is commonly used as an interior melting cheese for quesadillas, California-style burritos, and also some Mexican-style burritos (&quot;bean and cheese&quot;). It can also be used on cheeseburgers or for grilled cheese sandwiches. It has a mild flavor and good melting quality for some pasta dishes.

==Variants==

=== Dry Jack ===
Dry Jack was created by accident in 1915, when a San Francisco wholesaler forgot about a number of wheels of fresh Jack he had stored. As World War I intensified and shipments of hard cheese from Europe were interrupted, he rediscovered the wheels, which had aged into a product his customers found to be a good substitute for classic hard cheeses like Parmesan.

=== Pepper Jack ===

Pepper Jack is a derivative of Monterey Jack flavored with spicy chili peppers, bell peppers, and herbs.

==Headache safety==
Because of its low content of tyramine, an organic compound thought to be associated with headaches, Monterey Jack is frequently recommended as one of the few kinds of cheese that is safe to eat for migraine sufferers.

<text>Tung Chao-yung or C. Y. Tung (; 28 September 1912 – 15 April 1982), also known as Tung Hao-yun, ), was a Chinese shipping magnate and the founder of the Orient Overseas Line (now Orient Overseas Container Line or OOCL). He was the father of Tung Chee-hwa, the first chief executive of Hong Kong.

At the peak of his career, he owned a shipping fleet with over 150 freight ships; his fleet&#x27;s cargo capacity exceeded 10 million tons.

==Career==

Tung was born in Dinghai, Zhejiang, on Zhoushan Island. He spent his early business years in Tianjin and Shanghai.

In 1945, Tung bought an old boat, &quot;The Heavenly Dragon&quot;, which would become his company&#x27;s flagship and the first Chinese boat to drop anchor at European ports. He moved to Taiwan with the Kuomintang in 1949, and diversified his investments in Hong Kong with the companies Maritime Transport Limited, the Oriental Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Island Navigation Corporation.

Tung accumulated his fleet of ships over the next few years. In 1959, he built the largest tanker in the world, the 70,000 tonne &quot;Oriental Giant&quot;, followed by his first new boat in France. In 1973, he purchased the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, which he wanted to make into a floating university, an endeavour to later inspire the Semester at Sea programme.

Tung believed in the importance of education. In September 1970, he bought the former Cunard ocean liner to convert it into a floating university &quot;S.S. Seawise University&quot; to keep the World Campus Afloat programme alive. His goal was to help the United Nations train maritime specialists. On 9 January 1972, the ship caught fire during refurbishing and sank into Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong on the eve of her inaugural voyage. Tung did not give up on the plan because of this setback, and bought a smaller ocean liner, , to complete the plan. He cooperated with various universities (e.g. University of Pittsburgh) to run the academic sea programme with the Institute of Shipboard Education entitled Semester at Sea. In 1979, Tung received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Politically, Tung was aligned with Kuomintang regime of the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. The company emblem of the OOCL is a plum blossom, the national flower of the ROC, and Tung Group was considered the national merchant shipping company of the ROC. However, when the OOCL experienced financial trouble after his death, the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China rescued the company. This paved the way for Tung&#x27;s son, Tung Chee-hwa, to become the chief executive of Hong Kong, which became a special administrative region of China following the city&#x27;s 1997 handover from the UK.

<text>Midge Klump is a fictional character appearing in Archie Comics. She frequently appears as the girlfriend of Moose Mason and the unrequited crush of Reggie Mantle. The live-action version of Midge was portrayed by Emilija Baranac in the television take on Archie Comics produced by The CW, &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

==History==
Midge was created to serve as Moose&#x27;s girlfriend, debuting in Jughead #5 in 1951. Her birthday is said to be on July 4.

Like other characters, Midge evolves from a similar character. Originally, Moose dated a blonde girl named Lottie Little, who was replaced by Midge. For many years, Midge has a more petite build than the other girls in the comics, sharpening the contrast between herself and Moose. In later stories, however, she is as tall as her friends, with only her short dark hair making her identifiable.

==Relationships==
Midge is Moose Mason&#x27;s longtime girlfriend. Moose is deeply protective of Midge, and if he feels threatened about their relationship, any boy seen talking to her will end up enduring his wrath. Midge&#x27;s reactions to this vary from story to story.

She is occasionally annoyed by his violent jealousy, and dislikes being avoided by all of Riverdale&#x27;s boys because of it. However, because of Moose&#x27;s possessiveness over her, she has a &quot;taboo&quot; aspect to her that many of the young gentlemen in Riverdale find extremely appealing. Despite her aggravation with Moose&#x27;s overprotection of her, whenever another girl shows interest in Moose she reacts with the same jealousy.

At other times, Midge purposely makes Moose Mason jealous by flirting with or dating other boys. Originally, she flirted with all of them equally, but by the late 1960s, Reggie Mantle was the most frequent. Midge usually inadvertently, though thoughtlessly, sets Reggie up to be beaten up by Moose when she flirts with him. Occasionally Midge herself loses patience with Reggie. At such times, when Reggie shows up with a black eye or other evidence of having been harmed, Moose sees this and denies attacking Reggie—it turns out &quot;Midge&quot; did it.

Her closest friends are Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge. Other girls she is friends with include Nancy Woods and Big Ethel. Her relationship with them is much more stable than with the boys, though Veronica&#x27;s constant bragging often gets on her nerves.

In the&quot; Archie Marries Betty&quot; storyline, which takes place in a possible future, Midge finally tires of Moose&#x27;s jealousy and breaks up with him for good. She subsequently becomes close to Jughead (who now owns the Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe), and they soon fall in love. Later in the story, it&#x27;s revealed that they&#x27;re now married, and Midge is pregnant with their first child.

In the Riverdale Rescue game, Midge is one of a few main characters that can form romantic relationships with both boys and girls.

==Interests==
Few of Midge&#x27;s interests are mentioned in the comics. However, she is known to have athletic skills, and plays on the Riverdale softball team, in addition to being a cheerleader. Midge and her girlfriends enjoy activities together, such as shopping at the Riverdale Mall. In an episode of &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, Midge revealed that she wants to be a stuntwoman; in the TV movie &quot;&quot;, she became a chiropractor, and shares a practice with Moose. The comics, however, show no basis for an interest in either career.

==Alternate versions==
In &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Midge attends the school Halloween dance when the zombie apocalypse starts. When a zombified Jughead attacks the school dance, she and the others escape to Veronica Lodge&#x27;s home. They decide to go swimming to take their minds off of things. In private, Midge confides in Moose that she got a cut on her hand during the confusion at the school dance, although she doesn&#x27;t know from whom. She disinfects the wound and when Moose tries to convince her to tell the others she reassures his fears that she&#x27;ll turn by saying it would&#x27;ve already happened by now. She curls up with Moose and tells him that she loves him. When next they are seen, Midge and Moose have both turned into zombies and attack their friends who are in the pool. Smithers activates the aluminum pool cover, trapping the two zombified lovers in there. Reggie Mantle later revealed to Kevin Keller the reason he hit Hot Dog in the first place is because he was distracted and frustrated about Midge asking him for money so she could get an abortion.

<doc id="213214" wikidata="Q5326898" url="?curid=213214" title="Early stopping">
<text>In machine learning, early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting when training a model with an iterative method, such as gradient descent. Such methods update the model to make it better fit the training data with each iteration. Up to a point, this improves the model&#x27;s performance on data outside of the training set (e.g., the validation set). Past that point, however, improving the model&#x27;s fit to the training data comes at the expense of increased generalization error. Early stopping rules provide guidance as to how many iterations can be run before the learner begins to over-fit. Early stopping rules have been employed in many different machine learning methods, with varying amounts of theoretical foundation.

==Background==
This section presents some of the basic machine-learning concepts required for a description of early stopping methods.

===Overfitting===

Machine learning algorithms train a model based on a finite set of training data. During this training, the model is evaluated based on how well it predicts the observations contained in the training set. In general, however, the goal of a machine learning scheme is to produce a model that generalizes, that is, that predicts previously unseen observations. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the data in the training set well, while incurring larger generalization error.

===Regularization===

Regularization, in the context of machine learning, refers to the process of modifying a learning algorithm so as to prevent overfitting. This generally involves imposing some sort of smoothness constraint on the learned model.
This smoothness may be enforced explicitly, by fixing the number of parameters in the model, or by augmenting the cost function as in Tikhonov regularization. Tikhonov regularization, along with principal component regression and many other regularization schemes, fall under the umbrella of spectral regularization, regularization characterized by the application of a filter. Early stopping also belongs to this class of methods.

===Gradient descent methods===

Gradient descent methods are first-order, iterative, optimization methods. Each iteration updates an approximate solution to the optimization problem by taking a step in the direction of the negative of the gradient of the objective function. By choosing the step-size appropriately, such a method can be made to converge to a local minimum of the objective function. Gradient descent is used in machine-learning by defining a &quot;loss function&quot; that reflects the error of the learner on the training set and then minimizing that function.

==Early stopping based on analytical results==

===Early stopping in statistical learning theory===
Early-stopping can be used to regularize non-parametric regression problems encountered in machine learning. For a given input space, formula_1, output space, formula_2, and samples drawn from an unknown probability measure, formula_3, on formula_4, the goal of such problems is to approximate a &quot;regression function&quot;, formula_5, given by

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the conditional distribution at formula_8 induced by formula_3.
One common choice for approximating the regression function is to use functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These spaces can be infinite dimensional, in which they can supply solutions that overfit training sets of arbitrary size. Regularization is, therefore, especially important for these methods. One way to regularize non-parametric regression problems is to apply an early stopping rule to an iterative procedure such as gradient descent.

The early stopping rules proposed for these problems are based on analysis of upper bounds on the generalization error as a function of the iteration number. They yield prescriptions for the number of iterations to run that can be computed prior to starting the solution process.
====Example: Least-squares loss====
(Adapted from Yao, Rosasco and Caponnetto, 2007)

Let formula_10 and formula_11 Given a set of samples

:formula_12

drawn independently from formula_3, minimize the functional

:formula_14

where, formula_15 is a member of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space formula_16. That is, minimize the expected risk for a Least-squares loss function. Since formula_17 depends on the unknown probability measure formula_3, it cannot be used for computation. Instead, consider the following empirical risk

:formula_19

Let formula_20 and formula_21 be the &quot;t&quot;-th iterates of gradient descent applied to the expected and empirical risks, respectively, where both iterations are initialized at the origin, and both use the step size formula_22. The formula_20 form the &quot;population iteration&quot;, which converges to formula_5, but cannot be used in computation, while the formula_21 form the &quot;sample iteration&quot; which usually converges to an overfitting solution.

We want to control the difference between the expected risk of the sample iteration and the minimum expected risk, that is, the expected risk of the regression function:

:formula_26

This difference can be rewritten as the sum of two terms: the difference in expected risk between the sample and population iterations and that between the population iteration and the regression function:

:formula_27

This equation presents a bias-variance tradeoff, which is then solved to give an optimal stopping rule that may depend on the unknown probability distribution. That rule has associated probabilistic bounds on the generalization error. For the analysis leading to the early stopping rule and bounds, the reader is referred to the original article. In practice, data-driven methods, e.g. cross-validation can be used to obtain an adaptive stopping rule.

===Early stopping in boosting===
Boosting refers to a family of algorithms in which a set of weak learners (learners that are only slightly correlated with the true process) are combined to produce a strong learner. It has been shown, for several boosting algorithms (including AdaBoost), that regularization via early stopping can provide guarantees of consistency, that is, that the result of the algorithm approaches the true solution as the number of samples goes to infinity.


====L-boosting====
Boosting methods have close ties to the gradient descent methods described above can be regarded as a boosting method based on the formula_28 loss: &quot;LBoost&quot;.

==Validation-based early stopping==
These early stopping rules work by splitting the original training set into a new training set and a validation set. The error on the validation set is used as a proxy for the generalization error in determining when overfitting has begun. These methods are employed in the training of many iterative machine learning algorithms including neural networks. Prechelt gives the following summary of a naive implementation of holdout-based early stopping as follows:

Cross-validation is an alternative that is applicable to non time-series scenarios. Cross-validation involves splitting multiple partitions of the data into training set and validation set – instead of a single partition into a training set and validation set. Even this simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad hoc rules for deciding when overfitting has truly begun.

<doc id="213216" wikidata="Q151580" url="?curid=213216" title="Alexander Calder">
<text>Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Calder (; July 22, 1898 – November 11, 1976) was an American sculptor known both for his innovative mobiles (kinetic sculptures powered by motors or air currents) that embrace chance in their aesthetic, his static &quot;stabiles&quot;, and his monumental public sculptures. Calder preferred not to analyze his work, saying, &quot;Theories may be all very well for the artist himself, but they shouldn&#x27;t be broadcast to other people.&quot;

==Early life==
Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Calder was born in 1898 in Lawnton, Pennsylvania. His birthdate remains a source of confusion. According to Calder&#x27;s mother, Nanette (née Lederer), Calder was born on August 22, yet his birth certificate at Philadelphia City Hall, based on a hand-written ledger, stated July 22. When Calder&#x27;s family learned of the birth certificate, they asserted with certainty that city officials had made a mistake. His mother was Jewish and of German descent and his father was Calvinist and of Scottish descent, but Calder never practiced a religion and rejected nationalism.

Calder&#x27;s grandfather, sculptor Alexander Milne Calder, was born in Scotland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1868, and is best known for the colossal statue of William Penn on Philadelphia City Hall&#x27;s tower. His father, Alexander Stirling Calder, was a well-known sculptor who created many public installations, a majority of them in Philadelphia. Calder&#x27;s mother was a professional portrait artist, who had studied at the and the Sorbonne in Paris from around 1888 until 1893. She moved to Philadelphia, where she met Stirling Calder while studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Calder&#x27;s parents married on February 22, 1895. Alexander Calder&#x27;s sister, Margaret Calder Hayes, was instrumental in the development of the UC Berkeley Art Museum.

Four-year-old Calder posed nude for his father&#x27;s sculpture &quot;The Man Cub&quot;, a cast of which is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 1902 he also completed his earliest sculpture, a clay elephant. In 1905 his father contracted tuberculosis, and Calder&#x27;s parents moved to a ranch in Oracle, Arizona, leaving the children in the care of family friends for a year. The children were reunited with their parents in March 1906 and stayed at the Arizona ranch during that summer.

The Calder family moved from Arizona to Pasadena, California. The windowed cellar of the family home became Calder&#x27;s first studio and he received his first set of tools. He used scraps of copper wire to make jewelry for his sister&#x27;s dolls. On January 1, 1907, Nanette Calder took her son to the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, where he observed a four-horse-chariot race. This style of event later became the finale of Calder&#x27;s miniature circus performances.

In late 1909 the family returned to Philadelphia, where Calder briefly attended Germantown Academy, then they moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. That Christmas, he sculpted a dog and a duck out of sheet brass as gifts for his parents. The sculptures are three-dimensional and the duck is kinetic because it rocks when gently tapped. In Croton, during his high school years, Calder was befriended by his father&#x27;s painter friend Everett Shinn with whom he built a gravity-powered system of mechanical trains. Calder described it, &quot;We ran the train on wooden rails held by spikes; a chunk of iron racing down the incline speeded the cars. We even lit up some cars with candle lights&quot;. After Croton, the Calders moved to Spuyten Duyvil to be closer to New York City, where Stirling Calder rented a studio. While living in Spuyten Duyvil, Calder attended high school in nearby Yonkers. In 1912, Calder&#x27;s father was appointed acting chief of the Department of Sculpture of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California, and began work on sculptures for the exposition that was held in 1915.

During Calder&#x27;s high school years (1912–1915), the family moved back and forth between New York and California. In each new location, Calder&#x27;s parents reserved cellar space as a studio for their son. Near the end of this period, Calder stayed with friends in California while his parents moved back to New York, so that he could graduate from Lowell High School in San Francisco.  Calder graduated with the class of 1915. 

==Life and career==
Alexander Calder&#x27;s parents did not want him to be an artist, so he decided to study mechanical engineering. An intuitive engineer since childhood, Calder did not even know what mechanical engineering was. &quot;I was not very sure what this term meant, but I thought I&#x27;d better adopt it,&quot; he later wrote. He enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1915. When asked why he decided to study mechanical engineering instead of art Calder said, &quot;I wanted to be an engineer because some guy I rather liked was a mechanical engineer, that&#x27;s all&quot;. At Stevens, Calder was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and excelled in mathematics. He was well-liked and the class yearbook contained the following description, &quot;Sandy is evidently always happy, or perhaps up to some joke, for his face is always wrapped up in that same mischievous, juvenile grin. This is certainly the index to the man&#x27;s character in this case, for he is one of the best natured fellows there is.&quot;

In the summer of 1916, Calder spent five weeks training at the Plattsburgh Civilian Military Training Camp. In 1918, he joined the Student&#x27;s Army Training Corps, Naval Section, at Stevens and was made guide of the battalion.

Calder received a degree from Stevens in 1919. He held a variety of jobs including hydraulic engineer and draughtsman for the New York Edison Company. In June 1922, Calder took a mechanic position on the passenger ship &quot;H. F. Alexander&quot;. While sailing from San Francisco to New York City, Calder slept on deck and awoke one early morning off the Guatemalan Coast and witnessed both the sun rising and the full moon setting on opposite horizons. He described in his autobiography, &quot;It was early one morning on a calm sea, off Guatemala, when over my couch—a coil of rope—I saw the beginning of a fiery red sunrise on one side and the moon looking like a silver coin on the other.&quot;

The &quot;H.F. Alexander&quot; docked in San Francisco and Calder traveled to Aberdeen, Washington, where his sister and her husband, Kenneth Hayes resided. Calder took a job as a timekeeper at a logging camp. The mountain scenery inspired him to write home to request paints and brushes. Shortly after this, Calder decided to move back to New York to pursue a career as an artist.
In New York City, Calder enrolled at the Art Students League, studying briefly with George Luks, Boardman Robinson, and John Sloan. While a student, he worked for the &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; where, in 1925, one of his assignments was sketching the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Calder became fascinated with the circus action, a theme that would reappear in his later work.

In 1926, Calder moved to Paris, enrolled in the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, and established a studio at 22 rue Daguerre in the Montparnasse Quarter. In June 1929, while traveling by boat from Paris to New York, Calder met his future wife, Louisa James (1905–1996), a daughter of Edward Holton James and grandniece of author Henry James and philosopher William James. They married in 1931. While in Paris, Calder befriended a number of avant-garde artists, including Joan Miró, Fernand Léger, Jean Arp, and Marcel Duchamp. Leger wrote a preface for the catalogue of Calder&#x27;s first exhibition of abstract constructions held at the Galerie Percier in 1931. Calder and Louisa returned to America in 1933 to a farmhouse they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut, where they raised a family (Sandra born 1935, Mary born 1939). During World War II, Calder attempted to join the Marines as a camoufleur (see List of camoufleurs), but was rejected. In 1955 he and Louisa traveled through India for three months, where Calder produced nine sculptures as well as some jewelry.

In 1963, Calder settled into a new workshop, overlooking the valley of the Lower Chevrière to the village of Saché in Indre-et-Loire (France). He donated to the town a sculpture, which since 1974 has been situated in the town square. Throughout his artistic career, Calder named many of his works in French, regardless of where they were destined for eventual display.

In 1966, Calder published his &quot;Autobiography with Pictures&quot; with the help of his son-in-law, Jean Davidson.

Calder died unexpectedly in November 1976 of a heart attack, shortly after the opening of a major retrospective show at the Whitney Museum in New York.

==Artistic work==
=== Sculpture ===

In Paris in 1926, Calder began to create his &quot;Cirque Calder&quot;, a miniature circus fashioned from wire, cloth, string, rubber, cork, and other found objects. Designed to be transportable (it grew to fill five large suitcases), the circus was presented on both sides of the Atlantic. Soon, his &quot;Cirque Calder&quot; (on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at present) became popular with the Parisian avant-garde. He also invented wire sculpture, or &quot;drawing in space&quot;, and in 1929 had his first solo show of these sculptures in Paris at Galerie Billiet. &quot;Hi!&quot;, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an early example of the artist&#x27;s wire sculpture. The painter Jules Pascin, a friend from the cafes of Montparnasse, wrote the preface to the catalog.

A visit to Piet Mondrian&#x27;s studio in 1930, where he was impressed by the environment-as-installation, &quot;shocked&quot; him into fully embracing abstract art, toward which he had already been tending.
 It was the mixture of his experiments to develop purely abstract sculpture following his visit with Mondrian that led to his first truly kinetic sculptures, actuated by motors, that would become his signature artworks. Calder&#x27;s kinetic sculptures are regarded as being among the earliest manifestations of an art that consciously departed from the traditional notion of the art work as a static object and integrated the ideas of gesture and immateriality as aesthetic factors.

Dating from 1931, Calder&#x27;s abstract sculptures of discrete movable parts powered by motors were christened &quot;mobiles&quot; by Marcel Duchamp, a French pun meaning both &quot;motion&quot; and &quot;motive&quot;. However, Calder found that the motorized works sometimes became monotonous in their prescribed movements. His solution, arrived at by 1932, was hanging sculptures that derived their motion from touch or air currents. The earliest of these were made of wire, found objects, and wood, a material that Calder used since the 1920s. The hanging mobiles were followed in 1934 by outdoor standing mobiles in industrial materials, which were set in motion by the open air. The wind mobiles featured abstract shapes delicately balanced on pivoting rods that moved with the slightest current of air, allowing for a natural shifting play of forms and spatial relationships. Calder was also experimenting with self-supporting, static, abstract sculptures, dubbed &quot;stabiles&quot; by Jean Arp in 1932 to differentiate them from mobiles. At Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937), the Spanish pavilion included Calder&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Mercury Fountain&quot;.

During World War II, Calder continued to sculpt, adapting to a scarcity of aluminum during the war by returning to carved wood in a new open form of sculpture called &quot;constellations&quot;. Postwar, Calder began to cut shapes from sheet metal into evocative forms and hand-paint them in his characteristically bold hues. Calder created a small group of works from around this period with a hanging base-plate, for example &quot;Lily of Force&quot; (1945), &quot;Baby Flat Top&quot; (1946), and &quot;Red is Dominant&quot; (1947). He also made works such as &quot;Seven Horizontal Discs&quot; (1946), which, like &quot;Lily of Force&quot; (1945) and &quot;Baby Flat Top&quot; (1946), he was able to dismantle and send by mail for his upcoming show at Galerie Louis Carré in Paris, despite the stringent size restrictions imposed by the postal service at the time. His 1946 show at Carré, which was organized by Duchamp, was composed mainly of hanging and standing mobiles, and it made a huge impact, as did the essay for the catalogue by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. In 1951, Calder devised a new kind of sculpture, related structurally to his constellations. These &quot;towers&quot;, affixed to the wall with a nail, consist of wire struts and beams that jut from the wall, with moving objects suspended from their armatures.

While not denying Calder&#x27;s power as a sculptor, an alternate view of the history of twentieth-century art cites Calder&#x27;s turning away in the early 1930s from his motor-powered works in favor of the wind-driven mobile as marking a decisive moment in Modernism&#x27;s abandonment of its earlier commitment to the &quot;machine&quot; as a critical and potentially expressive new element in human affairs. According to this viewpoint, the mobile also marked an abandonment of Modernism&#x27;s larger goal of a rapprochement with science and engineering, and with unfortunate long-term implications for contemporary art.

===Monumental sculptures===

In 1934, Calder made his first outdoor works in his Roxbury, Connecticut studio, using the same techniques and materials as his smaller works. Exhibited outside, Calder&#x27;s initial standing mobiles moved elegantly in the breeze, bobbing and swirling in natural, spontaneous rhythms. The first few outdoor works were too delicate for strong winds, which forced Calder to rethink his fabrication process. By 1936 he changed his working methods and began to create smaller-scale maquettes that he then enlarged to monumental size. The small maquette, the first step in the production of a monumental sculpture, was considered by Calder a sculpture in its own right. Larger works used the classic enlargement techniques of traditional sculptors, including his father and grandfather. Drawing his designs on craft paper, he enlarged them using a grid. His large-scale works were created according to his exact specifications, while also allowing him the liberty to adjust or correct a shape or line if necessary.

In the 1950s, Calder concentrated more on producing monumental sculptures (his &quot;agrandissements&quot; period), and public commissions increasingly came his way in the 1960s. Notable examples are &quot;.125&quot; (1957) for JFK Airport in New York, &quot;Spirale&quot; (1958) for UNESCO in Paris, and &quot;Trois disques&quot;, commissioned for Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Calder&#x27;s largest sculpture, at high, was &quot;El Sol Rojo&quot;, constructed outside the Estadio Azteca for the 1968 Summer Olympics &quot;Cultural Olympiad&quot; events in Mexico City. Many of his public art works were commissioned by renowned architects; for example, I.M. Pei commissioned &quot;La Grande Voile&quot;, a 25-ton, stabile sculpture for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966.
Most of Calder&#x27;s monumental stationary and mobile sculptures were made after 1962 at Etablissements Biémont in Tours, France. He would create a model of his work, the engineering department would scale it up under Calder&#x27;s direction, and technicians would complete the actual metalwork — all under Calder&#x27;s watchful eye. Stabiles were made in steel plate, then painted. An exception was &quot;Trois disques&quot;, in stainless steel at tall, commissioned by International Nickel Company of Canada.

In 1958, Calder asked Jean Prouvé to construct the steel base of &quot;Spirale&quot; in France, a monumental mobile for the UNESCO site in Paris, while the top was fabricated in Connecticut.

In June 1969, Calder attended the dedication of his monumental &quot;stabile&quot; sculpture &quot;La Grande Vitesse&quot; in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This sculpture is notable for being the first civic sculpture in the United States to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 1971, Calder created his &quot;Bent Propeller&quot; which was installed at the entrance of the World Trade Center&#x27;s North Tower in New York City. When Battery Park City opened, the sculpture was moved to Vesey and Church Streets. The sculpture stood in front of 7 World Trade Center until it was destroyed on September 11, 2001.
In 1973, the vermillion-colored public art sculpture &quot;Four Arches&quot; was installed on Bunker Hill, Los Angeles to serve as &quot;a distinctive landmark&quot;. The plaza site was designed in tiers to maximize the sculpture&#x27;s visual effects.

In 1974, Calder unveiled two sculptures, &quot;Flamingo&quot; at Federal Plaza and &quot;Universe&quot; at Sears Tower, in Chicago, Illinois, accompanied by the exhibition &quot;Alexander Calder: A Retrospective Exhibition,&quot; at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago which opened simultaneously with the unveiling of the sculptures.

Originally meant to be constructed in 1977 for the Hart Senate Office Building, &quot;Mountains and Clouds&quot; was not built until 1985 due to government budget cuts. The massive sheet-metal project, weighing 35 tons, spans the nine-story height of the building&#x27;s atrium in Washington, D.C. Calder designed the maquette for the United States Senate in the last year of his life.

===Theatrical productions===
Calder created stage sets for more than a dozen theatrical productions, including &quot;Nucléa&quot;, &quot;Horizon&quot;, and most notably, Martha Graham&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; (1935), a production of the Erik Satie symphonic drama &quot;Socrate&quot; (1936), and later, &quot;Works in Progress&quot; (1968). &quot;Works in Progress&quot; was a &quot;ballet&quot; conceived by Calder himself and produced at the Rome Opera House, featuring an array of mobiles, stabiles, and large painted backdrops. Calder would describe some of his stage sets as dancers performing a choreography due to their rhythmic movement.

===Painting and printmaking===
In addition to sculptures, Calder painted throughout his career, beginning in the early 1920s. He picked up his study of printmaking in 1925, and continued to produce illustrations for books and journals. His projects from this period include pen-and-ink line drawings of animals for a 1931 publication of Aesop&#x27;s fables. As Calder&#x27;s sculpture moved into the realm of pure abstraction in the early 1930s, so did his prints. The thin lines used to define figures in the earlier prints and drawings began delineating groups of geometric shapes, often in motion. Calder also used prints for advocacy, as in poster prints from 1967 and 1969 protesting the Vietnam War.

As Calder&#x27;s professional reputation expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s, so did his production of prints. Masses of lithographs based on his gouache paintings were marketed, and deluxe editions of plays, poems, and short stories illustrated with fine art prints by Calder became available.

===Painted aircraft and automobile===

One of Calder&#x27;s more unusual undertakings was a commission from Dallas-based Braniff International Airways to paint a full-size Douglas DC-8-62 four-engined jet as a &quot;flying canvas&quot;. George Stanley Gordon, founder of the New York City advertising agency Gordon and Shortt, approached Calder with the idea of painting a jet in 1972, but Calder responded that he did not paint toys. When Gordon told him it was a real, full-sized airliner he was proposing, the artist immediately gave his approval. Gordon felt that Braniff, known for melding the worlds of fashion and design with the world of aviation, would be the perfect company to carry out the idea. Braniff Chairman Harding Lawrence was highly receptive and a contract was drawn up in 1973 calling for the painting of one Douglas DC-8-62 jet liner, dubbed &quot;Flying Colors&quot;, and 50 gouaches for a total price of $100,000. Two years later, Braniff asked Calder to design a flagship for their fleet celebrating the U.S. Bicentennial. That piece, a Boeing 727-291 jet N408BN called the &quot;Flying Colors of the United States&quot;, and nicknamed the &#x27;Sneaky Snake&#x27; by its pilots (based on quirky flight tendencies), featured a rippled image of red, white and blue echoing a waving American flag. A third design, to be dubbed &quot;Salute to Mexico&quot;, was commissioned but went uncompleted following his death.

In 1975 Calder was commissioned to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL automobile, which would be the first vehicle in the BMW Art Car Project.

===Jewelry===
Calder created over 2,000 pieces of jewelry over the course of his career, many as gifts for friends. Several pieces reflect his fascination with art from Africa and other continents. They were mostly made of brass and steel, with bits of ceramic, wood and glass. Calder rarely used solder; when he needed to join strips of metal, he linked them with loops, bound them with snippets of wire or fashioned rivets. Calder created his first pieces in 1906 at the age of eight for his sister&#x27;s dolls using copper wire that he found in the street.

For his lifelong friend Joan Miró, Calder set a shard of a broken porcelain vessel in a brass ring. Peggy Guggenheim received enormous silver mobile earrings and later commissioned a hammered silver headboard that shimmered with dangling fish. In 1942, Guggenheim wore one Calder earring and one by Yves Tanguy to the opening of her New York gallery, The Art of This Century, to demonstrate her equal loyalty to Surrealist and abstract art, examples of which she displayed in separate galleries. Others who were presented with Calder&#x27;s pieces were the artist&#x27;s close friend, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe; Teeny Duchamp, wife of Marcel Duchamp; Jeanne Rucar, wife of the filmmaker Luis Buñuel; and Bella Rosenfeld, wife of Marc Chagall.

==Exhibitions==

Calder&#x27;s first solo exhibition was in 1927 at the Gallery of Jacques Seligmann in Paris. His first solo show in a US commercial gallery was in 1928 at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. He exhibited with the Abstraction-Création group in Paris in 1933.

In 1935, he had his first solo museum exhibition in the United States at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago. In New York, he was championed from the early 1930s by the Museum of Modern Art, and was one of three Americans to be included in Alfred H. Barr Jr.&#x27;s 1936 exhibition &quot;Cubism and Abstract Art&quot;.

Calder&#x27;s first retrospective was held in 1938 at George Walter Vincent Smith Gallery in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1943, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a Calder retrospective, curated by James Johnson Sweeney and Marcel Duchamp; the show had to be extended due to the number of visitors. Calder was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. His mobile, &quot;International Mobile&quot; was the centerpiece of the exhibition. Calder also participated in &quot;documentas&quot; I (1955), II (1959), III (1964). Major retrospectives of his work were held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1964), the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France (1969), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974). In addition, both of Calder&#x27;s dealers, Galerie Maeght in Paris and the Perls Galleries in New York, averaged about one Calder show each per year.

==Collections==
Calder&#x27;s work is in many permanent collections across the world. The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, has the largest body of work by Alexander Calder. Other museum collections include the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; the Seattle Art Museum; and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. There are two pieces on display in the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art offers a view of works by three generations of Alexander Calders. From the second floor window on the east side of the Great Stair Hall (on the opposite side from the armor collection) there is behind the viewer Calder&#x27;s own &quot;Ghost&quot; mobile, ahead on the street is the &quot;Swann Memorial Fountain&quot; by his father, A. Stirling Calder, and beyond that the statue of &quot;William Penn&quot; atop City Hall by Calder&#x27;s grandfather, Alexander Milne Calder.

==Calder Gardens==
Calder Gardens, a 1.8-acre, indoor-outdoor center dedicated to Calder&#x27;s work is set to open on Philadelphia&#x27;s Benjamin Franklin Parkway in September 2025. Juana Berrío has been named as Senior Director of Programs.

==Art market==
In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Calder&#x27;s works were not highly sought after, and when they sold, it was often for relatively little money. A copy of a Pierre Matisse sales ledger in the foundation&#x27;s files shows that only a few pieces in the 1941 show found buyers, one of whom, Solomon R. Guggenheim, paid only $233.34 () for a work. The Museum of Modern Art had bought its first Calder in 1934 for $60, after talking Calder down from $100. And yet by 1948 Calder nearly sold out an entire solo show in Rio de Janeiro, becoming the first internationally renowned sculptor. Galerie Maeght in Paris became Calder&#x27;s exclusive Parisian dealer in 1950 and for the rest of Calder&#x27;s life. After his New York dealer Curt Valentin died unexpectedly in 1954, Calder selected the Perls Galleries in New York as his new American dealer, and this alliance lasted until Calder&#x27;s death.

In 2010, his metal mobile &quot;Untitled (Autumn Leaves)&quot;, sold at Sotheby&#x27;s New York for $3.7 million. Another mobile brought $6.35 million at Christie&#x27;s later that year. Also at Christie&#x27;s, a standing mobile called &quot;Lily of Force&quot; (1945), which was expected to sell for $8 to $12 million, was bought for $18.5 million in 2012. Calder&#x27;s 7.5-foot-long hanging mobile &quot;Poisson volant (Flying Fish)&quot; (1957) fetched $25.9 million, setting an auction record for the sculptor at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2014.

==Legacy==

Beginning in 1966, winners of the National Magazine Awards are awarded an &quot;Ellie&quot;, a copper-colored stabile resembling an elephant, which was designed by Calder. Two months after his death, the artist was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&#x27; highest civilian honor, by President Gerald Ford. However, representatives of the Calder family boycotted the January 10, 1977, ceremony &quot;to make a statement favoring amnesty for Vietnam War draft resisters&quot;.

===Calder Foundation===
In 1987, the Calder Foundation was established by Calder&#x27;s family, &quot;dedicated to collecting, exhibiting, preserving, and interpreting the art and archives of Alexander Calder and [is] charged with an unmatched collection of his works&quot;. The foundation has large holdings, with some works owned by family members and others by foundation supporters. The art includes more than 600 sculptures including mobiles, stabiles, standing mobiles, and wire sculptures, and 22 monumental outdoor works, as well as thousands of oil paintings, works on paper, toys, pieces of jewelry, and domestic objects.
After having worked mainly on cataloging Calder&#x27;s works, the Calder Foundation is now focusing on organizing global exhibitions for the artist. One of Calder&#x27;s grandsons, Alexander S. C. &quot;Sandy&quot; Rower, is the president of the foundation and other family members are on the board of trustees.

===Authenticity issues===
The Calder Foundation does not authenticate artworks; rather, owners can submit their works for registration in the Foundation&#x27;s archive and for examination. The committee that performs examinations includes experts, scholars, museum curators, and members of the Calder family. The Calder Foundation&#x27;s website provides details on the current policies and guidelines governing examination procedures.

In 1993, the owners of &quot;Rio Nero&quot; (1959), a sheet-metal and steel-wire mobile ostensibly by Calder, went to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging that it was not by Alexander Calder, as claimed by its seller. That same year, a federal judge ruled that for &quot;Rio Nero&quot; the burden of proof had not been fulfilled. Despite the decision, the owners of the mobile could not sell it because the recognized expert, Klaus Perls, had declared it a copy. The judge recognized the problem at the time, noting that Perls&#x27; pronouncement would make &quot;Rio Nero&quot; unsellable. In 1994, the Calder Foundation declined to include the mobile in the catalogue raisonné on the artist.

Referring to the &quot;Rio Nero&quot; case, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in 2009 rejected the appeal of an art collector who wished to sell a couple of stage sets that Calder had designed but did not live to see completed, which had been unsuccessfully submitted to the Calder Foundation for authentication. The court found that it did not have the power to declare the purported Calder work authentic, nor to order the Calder Foundation to include it in the catalogue raisonné.

In 1995, questions arose about another purported Calder, &quot;Two White Dots&quot; (not to be confused with the similarly named piece, &quot;Two White Dots in the Air&quot;, which Calder created in 1958). In 1973, Calder had created a -high sheet metal maquette for an unrealized stabile he called &quot;Two White Dots&quot;. He gave this maquette to Carmen Segretario, founder and owner of the Segré Foundry of Waterbury, Connecticut. For decades, Calder had utilized the services of Segré Foundry in manufacturing his mobiles and stabiles. Each piece (no matter how many copies were made) would be initialed personally by Calder in white chalk, after which a welder would follow the chalk marks to burn the initials into the work. Calder died in 1976, without a full-size version of &quot;Two White Dots&quot; having been made. In 1982, Segretario constructed a full-size version of &quot;Two White Dots&quot;, and sold it in 1983 to art dealer Shirley Teplitz for $70,000. Segetario&#x27;s documentation claimed that the work had been fabricated around 1974 &quot;under the supervision and direction of Artist&quot;. &quot;Two White Dots&quot; was then sold at auction in May 1984 for $187,000. Over the next decade, the piece was sold repeatedly. In 1995, Jon Shirley (the former president of Microsoft and a Calder collector) purchased &quot;Two White Dots&quot; for $1 million. When Shirley submitted the work to the Calder Foundation for inclusion in their catalogue raisonné, the Foundation contested the work&#x27;s authenticity. The André Emmerich Gallery refunded Shirley&#x27;s money, and sued the Segré Foundry, which sought bankruptcy protection. The suit was settled out of court in the late 1990s. &quot;Two White Dots&quot; now resides outdoors on a farm near a river outside the small town of Washington, Connecticut.

In 2013 the Calder Estate filed a lawsuit against the estate of his former dealer, Klaus Perls, alleging that Perls had sold fake Calders as well as concealing the ownership of 679 works by the artist. After a high-profile battle with much press coverage, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Shirley Werner Kornreich in the New York State Supreme Court.

== Personal life ==
Calder and his wife, Louisa, were the parents of two daughters, Sandra (1935–2022) and Mary (1939-2011). Mary&#x27;s husband, Howard Rower (1939–2000), had been chairman of the board of the Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation. Mary and Howard&#x27;s two sons are Alexander S. C. &quot;Sandy&quot; Rower (1963), president of the Calder Foundation, and Holton Rower (1962), a vice president of the Foundation. Alexander Rower established the Foundation in 1987 with the support of the Calder family. He has four children, including Gryphon Rower-Upjohn, a sound experimentalist, composer-performer, and curator in the field of audiovisual culture, who is also known as Gryphon Rue.

Sandra Calder Davidson and her late husband, Jean Davidson, had a son, Shawn (1956), and a daughter, Andréa (1961). Shawn and Andréa are vice presidents of the Calder Foundation. Jean Davidson was the son of artist Jo Davidson. Sandra was an illustrator of children&#x27;s books. She caricatured her family and friends as animals in the 2013 book &quot;The Calder Family and Other Critters: Portraits and Reflections.&quot;

The Calder family has a long-standing connection with the Putney School, a progressive co-ed boarding school in Vermont. Calder&#x27;s daughters attended the school as did several of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Around 2007, the Rower family donated a standing mobile (a mobile that stands on its own fixed base) to Putney. A 13-foot mobile hangs in Calder Hall in the Michael S. Currier Center on campus.

<doc id="213219" wikidata="Q5775646" url="?curid=213219" title="History of Chinese immigration to Canada">
<text>Chinese immigrants began settling in Canada in the 1780s. The major periods of Chinese immigration would take place from 1858 to 1923 and 1947 to the present day, reflecting changes in the Canadian government&#x27;s immigration policy.

Chinese immigrants were initially sought after by Canadian employers as a source of cheap labour due to Canada&#x27;s relative wealth at the time and the difficult economic conditions in China. Between 1880 and 1885, the primary work for Chinese labourers in Canada was on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) but records of Chinese immigration start more than a century earlier.

== Nootka Sound, 1770s ==

In 1788, some 120 Chinese contract labourers arrived at Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island. British fur trader John Meares recruited an initial group of 50 sailors and artisans from Canton (Guangzhou) and Macao, China, hoping to build a trading post and encourage trade in sea otter pelts between Nootka Sound and Canton. At Nootka Sound, the Chinese workers built a dockyard, a fort, and a sailing ship, named the &quot;North West America&quot;. Regarding this journey and the future prospects of Chinese settlement in colonial North America, Meares wrote:
The next year, Meares had another 70 Chinese brought in from Canton. However, shortly after the arrival of this second group, the settlement was seized by the Spanish in what became known as the Nootka Crisis. Seeking to establish a trade monopoly on the West Coast, the Spanish imprisoned the Chinese men. It is unclear what became of them, but likely some returned to China while others were put to work in a nearby mine and later taken to Mexico. No other Chinese people are known to have arrived in western North America until the gold rush of the 1850s.

== Gold Rush, 1858 ==
The Chinese first appeared in large numbers in the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1858 as part of a huge migration from California during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in the newly declared Colony of British Columbia. Although the first wave arrived in May from California, news of the gold rush eventually attracted many people from China. As a result, Barkerville, British Columbia—located in the Cariboo—became Canada&#x27;s first Chinese community, where more than half of the town&#x27;s population was estimated to be Chinese. Several other BC towns also had significant Chinatowns, including Richfield, Stanley, Van Winkle, Quesnellemouthe (modern-day Quesnel), Antler, and Quesnelle Forks.

 In the goldfields, Chinese mining techniques and knowledge turned out to be better than those of other miners. They employed hydraulic techniques, such as the use of &#x27;rockers&#x27;, and a technique whereby blankets were used to filter alluvial sand and then burned, resulting in the gold melting into lumps in the fire. In the Fraser Canyon, Chinese miners stayed on long after all others had left for the Cariboo Gold Rush or other goldfields elsewhere in BC or the United States. They continued hydraulic mining and farming, and owned the majority of land in the Fraser and Thompson canyons for many years afterward.

There was no shortage of successful Chinese miners: by 1860, the Chinese population of Vancouver Island and British Columbia was estimated to be 7,000. Moreover, Lillooet&#x27;s Chinatown lasted until the 1930s.

== Immigration for the railway, 1871–82 ==
When British Columbia (BC) agreed to join Confederation in 1871, one of its conditions was that the Government of Canada build a railway linking BC to Eastern Canada within 10 years. British Columbian politicians and their electorate agitated for a settlement-immigration program for workers from the British Isles to provide this railway labor; however, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, along with investors and other Canadian politicians, said this would be too expensive.

In opposition, however, the Workingmen&#x27;s Protective Association was established in 1878 in Victoria with the following purpose:The objects of this society shall be the mutual protection of the working classes of British Columbia against the great influx of Chinese; to use all legitimate means for the suppression of their immigration; to assist each other in the obtaining of employment, and to devise means for the amelioration of the condition of the working classes of the Province in general.Insisting that the project cut costs by employing Chinese workers to build the railway, Prime Minister MacDonald told Parliament in 1882: &quot;It is simply a question of alternatives: either you must have this labour or you can&#x27;t have the railway.&quot;

In 1880, Andrew Onderdonk — an American who was one of the main construction contractors in British Columbia for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) — originally recruited Chinese laborers from California. When most of them deserted the railway workings for the more lucrative goldfields, Onderdonk and his agents signed several agreements with Chinese contractors in China&#x27;s Guangdong province and Taiwan, as well as via Chinese companies in Victoria. These Chinese railway workers would be hired for the of the CPR considered to be among the more difficult segments of the projected railway, particularly the area that goes through the Fraser Canyon.

Chinese-Canadian labor was characterized by low wages (usually receiving less than 50% of what Caucasian workers were paid for the same work) and high levels of volatility. Through Onderdonk&#x27;s contracts, more than 5,000 laborers were sent as &quot;guest workers&quot; from China by ship, in addition to over 7,000 Chinese railway workers from California whom Onderdonk also recruited. These two groups of workers, who were willing to accept a day for their labor, were the main force for the building of Onderdonk&#x27;s 7% of the railway&#x27;s mileage.

Between 1880 and 1885, 17,000 Chinese laborers completed the British Columbia section of the CPR, with more than 700 perishing due to appalling working conditions. As was the case with non-Chinese workers, some of the laborers fell ill during construction, or died while planting explosives or in other construction accidents.

As with railway workers on other parts of the line in the Prairies and Northern Ontario, most of the Chinese workers lived in canvas tents. These tents were often unsafe and did not provide adequate protection against falling rocks or severe weather in areas of steep terrain. Such tents were typical of working-class accommodations on the frontier for all immigrant workers although (non-Chinese) foremen, shift bosses, and trained railwaymen recruited from the UK were housed in sleeping cars and railway-built houses in Yale and the other railway towns. Chinese railway workers also established transient Chinatowns along the rail line, with housing at the largest consisting of log-houses half dug into the ground, which was a common housing style for natives as well as other frontier settlers, because of the insulating effect of the ground in an area of extreme temperatures.

Largely because of the Trans-Canada railway, Chinese communities developed across the nation, with the vast majority of Chinese Canadians lived in British Columbia during the 1880s.

=== Clan associations, community structure and support ===
For much of the 19th and 20th century most Chinese people in Canada were a part of clan associations (based on the tsung-tsu system), which provided a strong community support network. Membership in these associations were mostly based on surnames which assumes that everyone with the same surname shared a remote common ancestor. In the early 1880s, there were about 129 clans in Canada and each was quite small, but the membership in each clan mostly came from just one or two counties in China. This reveals streams of migration from certain villages in China to locations in British Columbia, lasting through generations. There were also clan associations that limited membership based on village/county rather than surname, and two prominent associations that were free for anyone to join - the Chinese Freemasons and Kuomintang. They extend from political groups in China, but in Canada, their significance was not necessarily related to political activities, focusing more on economic or other functions in the local community. Many of these associations were joined in larger community networks, such as the Chinese Benevolent Association (CBA). CBA represented their member associations and acted as a political body that could interact with external, non-Chinese groups. Although there was a lot of community solidarity, the clan system was sometimes a divisive force that fostered conflict or cross-association feuds. Other immigrant groups in Canada also organized mutual-aid and cultural societies and associations, but none as extensive or cross-cutting as the Chinese. The Chinese associations were organized not just as a response to discrimination but also reflected the socio-cultural peculiarities of southeastern China.

== After completion of the CPR 1885–1947 ==
From the completion of the CPR to the end of the Exclusion Era (1923–1947), Chinese in Canada lived in mainly a &quot;bachelors of the backpack society&quot; since most Chinese families could not pay the expensive head tax to send their daughters to Canada.

As with many other groups of immigrants, the Chinese initially found it hard to adjust and assimilate into life in Canada. As a result, they formed ethnic enclaves known as &quot;Chinatowns&quot; where they could live alongside fellow Chinese immigrants, with the vast majority of Chinese Canadians lived in BC during the 1880s. Originally, the Chinese were often stereotyped as , meaning temporary. Especially during the 19th century, the white society in British Columbia perceived the Chinese as people who could not be assimilated. In 1885, the Qing Dynasty Consul General Huang Zunxian told a Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration:[I]t is charged that the Chinese do not emigrate to foreign countries to remain, but only to earn a sum of money and return to their homes in China. It is only about thirty years since our people commenced emigrating to other lands. A large number have gone to the Straits&#x27; Settlements, Manila, Cochin China, and the West India Islands, and are permanently settled there with their families. In Cuba, fully seventy-five percent have married native women and adopted those Islands as their future homes. Many of those living in the Sandwich Islands have done the same... You must recollect that the Chinese immigrant coming to this country is denied all the rights and privileges extended to others in the way of citizenship; the laws compel them to remain aliens. I know a great many Chinese will be glad to remain here permanently with their families if they are allowed to be naturalized and can enjoy privileges and rights.By 1886, the population of Victoria Chinatown had increased tenfold from the completion of the CPR to over 17,000; and at the turn of the 20th century, there were 17,312 Chinese settlers in Canada. By the 1940s, almost 50% of the Chinese-Canadian population lived on the West Coast.

=== Immigration Acts and Exclusion Era, 1885–1947 ===
In 1885, the Government of Canada passed the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act, 1885&quot;, levying a &#x27;Head Tax&#x27; of $50 on any Chinese coming to Canada, thereby making Chinese people the only ethnic group to pay a tax in order to enter Canada. What&#x27;s more is that, well before the 1885 Act, a series of Chinese tax acts were passed in British Columbia. After the 1885 legislation failed to deter Chinese immigration, the Canadian government passed the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act, 1900&quot; to increase the tax to $100. The Chinese had no choice but to pay it even though it was worth two years&#x27; salary of a railway worker.

==== Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, 1885 ====
Soon afterward, Chinese merchants among larger Chinese communities formed the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA), which was registered as a charitable organization in August 1884, but effectively served as an &quot;internal administrative institution&quot; in the Chinese-Canadian community. The CCBA opened their first branch in Victoria in 1885 and a second in Vancouver in 1895. The Association was mandatory for all Chinese in the area to join and would do everything from representing members in legal disputes to sending the remains of members who died back to their ancestral homelands in China.

Huang Zunxian, the Chinese Consulate in San-Francisco, played an integral role in the establishment of CCBA:Now the Honorable Huang Zun Xian permitted to forward our case to the Chinese Ambassador to England to send again an official protest to the British Government. He also instructed that we raise funds, firstly, to hire lawyers for the case, and secondly, to be prepared for the establishment of The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. This Chinese representative body could, therefore, address all the issues concerning the Westerners, and do benevolence by taking care of the sick and the poor Chinese.With the large extent of discriminatory legislation against Chinese immigrants, CCBA worked actively in seeking external support, for instance, by sending letters to the Chinese Ambassador to England and the Chinese Foreign Minister, as well as corresponding with the Chinese Consul in San-Francisco. CCBA would also send petitions to local administrations. In 1909, in response to the City of Victoria&#x27;s policy of segregating Chinese children in public schools, CCBA constructed the Chinese Public School.

In addition, during the early 20th century, fraternal-political associations such as the Guomindang and the Freemasons were involved in Chinatown politics and community issues, adjudicating disputes within the community and speaking for the community to the non-Chinese world. After legislation in 1896 that stripped Chinese of voting rights in municipal elections in BC, Chinese people in BC became completely disenfranchised. The elector&#x27;s list in federal elections came from the provincial elector&#x27;s list, and the provincial ones came from the municipal one.

==== Royal Commission and Chinese professions, 1902–07 ====
In 1902, the federal government appointed a Royal Commission on Chinese and Japanese Immigration, which concluded that &quot;the Chinese are more unhealthy as a class than the same class of white people,&quot; and that they were &quot;unfit for full citizenship...obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state.&quot; Through the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act, 1903&quot;, the Government would further increase the landing fees to $500 (equivalent to CA$10,336.27 in 2021) following demand by B.C. politicians. Following the 1903 legislation of $500, the number of Chinese who paid the fee in the first fiscal year dropped from 4,719 to 8.

In addition to federal legislation, municipal ordinances restricted employment opportunities. In BC, Chinese professionals were prohibited from practicing such professions as law, pharmacy, and accountancy. During the next 40 years after 1885, following the completion of the CPR, Chinese persons became involved in the labor behind an industrializing economy. With legislation banning Chinese from many professions, Chinese entered those that non-Chinese Canadians did not want to do, such as laundry shops or salmon processing. Skilled or semi-skilled, Chinese Canadians labored in British Columbia sawmills and canneries; others became market gardeners or grocers, pedlars, shopkeepers, and restaurateurs. A &quot;credit-ticket&quot; system evolved in this time whereby Chinese lenders in China or North America would agree to pay the travel expenses of a migrant who was then bound to the lender until the debt was repaid, despite the fact that such contracts would not be legally enforceable in Canada. Chinese workers opened grocery stores and restaurants that served the whole population, including non-Chinese, and Chinese cooks became the mainstay in the restaurant and hotel industries as well as in private service. Chinese success at market gardening led to a continuing prominent role in the produce industry in British Columbia. Ethnic discrimination was rampant during these times, as evidenced by large-scale Anti-Asian Riots in Vancouver in 1907.

==== Exclusion Act, 1923 ====
The &quot;Chinese Immigration Act, 1923&quot;, better known as the &quot;Chinese Exclusion Act&quot;, replaced prohibitive fees with an outright ban on Chinese immigration to Canada with the exceptions of merchants, diplomats, students, and &quot;special circumstances&quot; cases. (Ethnic Chinese people with British nationality were also restricted from entering Canada.) The Chinese who entered Canada prior to 1924 had to register with the local authorities and could leave Canada only for two years or less.

Just before the enactment of the Exclusion Act, the Chinese Association of Canada went to Ottawa to lobby against the bill. Since the Act went into effect on 1 July 1923, Chinese people at the time referred to Dominion Day as &quot;Humiliation Day&quot; and refused to celebrate Dominion Day until after the act was repealed in 1947. Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown during the exclusion era became a thriving economic and social destination that was home to many Chinese Canadians on the West Coast.

The discriminatory laws also gave way to a gender imbalance among Chinese immigrants. Primarily due to the head tax, the cost of bringing a dependent, such as a wife or aged parents, to Canada became prohibitive. As such, Chinese men typically came alone, living as bachelors in Canada. In 1886, there were only 119 females among a total population of 1680; in 1931, only 3,648 were women among a total Chinese population of 46,519. A survey was done in 1922 by Republican China&#x27;s Overseas Chinese Bureau showed that, among Victoria Chinatown&#x27;s whole population of 3,681, only 456 were females. In the late 1920s, it was estimated that there were only five married Chinese women in Calgary and six in Edmonton.

== Post-war period, 1947–99 ==
With the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act, 1923&quot; being repealed in 1947, the majority of immigrants in Canada emigrated from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including Hong Kong, and the Republic of China (Taiwan). Other Chinese immigrants have come from South Asia, Southeast Asia, South Africa, the Caribbean, and South America. From 1947 to the early 1970s, Chinese immigrants to Canada came mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Southeast Asia. Chinese-Canadians gained the vote federally and provincially in 1947. Chinese immigration, still, was limited only to the spouse of a Chinese man who had Canadian citizenship and his dependents.

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949 and its support for the communist North in the Korean War, Chinese in Canada faced another wave of resentment, as Chinese were viewed as communist agents from the PRC. Moreover, those from mainland China who were eligible in the family reunification program had to visit the Canadian High Commission in Hong Kong, as Canada and the PRC did not have diplomatic relations until 1970.

=== Chinese Adjustment Statement Program and other policies, 1960–73 ===
In 1959, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration discovered a problem with immigration papers used by Chinese immigrants to enter Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were brought in to investigate. Evidently, some Chinese had been entering Canada by purchasing real or fake birth certificates of Chinese-Canadian children bought and sold in Hong Kong. These children carrying false identity papers were referred to as &quot;paper sons&quot;. In response, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Ellen Fairclough announced the &quot;Chinese Adjustment Statement Program&quot; on 9 June 1960, which granted amnesty for paper sons or daughters if they confessed to the government. As a result, about 12,000 paper sons came forward, until the amnesty period ended in October 1973.

Independent Chinese immigration in Canada came after Canada eliminated race and the &quot;place of origin&quot; section from its immigration policy in 1967. Four years later, in 1971, an official policy of multiculturalism was implemented in efforts to tackle institutional racism.

Many Chinese also enlisted in the Canadian forces, despite Ottawa and the BC government being unwilling to send Chinese-Canadian recruits into action, since they did not want Chinese to ask for enfranchisement after the war. However, with 90,000 British troops captured in the Battles of Malaya and Singapore in February 1942, Ottawa decided to send Chinese-Canadian forces in as spies to train the local guerrillas to resist the Japanese Imperial Forces in 1944. These spies were nevertheless little more than a token gesture, as the outcome of World War II had been more or less decided by that time.

=== Late 1970s ===
A turning point for Chinese in Canada was an incident in September 1979 involving a report on a high-profile current affairs series on commercial Canadian TV, &quot;W5&quot;, which stated that foreign Chinese were taking away opportunities from Canadian citizens for university educations. In response, Chinese communities nationwide united to fight anti-Chinese sentiments.

The report, suggesting that there were 100,000 foreign students, featured a girl complaining that her high marks had not allowed her into the University of Toronto&#x27;s pharmacy program because seats had been taken up by foreign students.

The data used in the report, however, proved inaccurate. The Canadian Bureau for International Education revealed that there were only 55,000 foreign students in Canada at all levels of education, and only 20,000 full-time foreign university students. Historian Anthony B. Chan devoted an entire chapter of his 1983 book &quot;Gold Mountain&quot; to the incident, and found that, contrary to the claims of the prospective pharmacy student, there were no foreign students in Toronto&#x27;s program that year. Chan emphasized the anger that the Chinese-Canadian community had about the images of anonymous Chinese people in the feature was because they felt the &quot;implication was that all students of Chinese origin were foreigners, and that Canadian taxpayers were subsidizing Chinese students—regardless of citizenship.&quot;

Chinese communities nationwide staged protests against CTV Television, the network that airs &quot;W5&quot;. Initially, CTV would only offer a &quot;statement of regret&quot; but the protests continued until an apology was made in 1980. Network executive Murray Chercover acknowledged the inaccuracy of a great deal of the program&#x27;s information, adding that the network &quot;sincerely apologize[s] for the fact Chinese-Canadians were depicted as foreigners, and for whatever distress this stereotyping may have caused them in the context of our multicultural society.&quot; The protesters met in Toronto in 1980 and agreed to form the Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) to better represent Chinese Canadians on a national level.

=== 1980s–90s ===
The 1980s saw movement of Chinese in Canada from the ethnic enclaves of Chinatowns to outlying suburbs of major Canadian cities. This movement was seen by some as changing the fabric of some communities with the establishment of new ethnic enclaves, commercial areas, and use of Chinese-language signage. Carole Bell, Deputy Mayor of Markham, Ontario, expressed that the overwhelming Chinese presence in the city was causing other residents to move out of Markham. Additionally during the 1980s, local communities in Toronto and Vancouver have accused the Chinese immigrants for hyperinflating property prices.

During the mid-1980s and early 1990s, Canada&#x27;s recession and growth of the Chinese economy resulted in a shift in Chinese migration in Canada. Attracted by the employment opportunities back home, some newer immigrants moved back, with many retaining their Canadian citizenship. This resulted in the phenomenon of &quot;astronaut families&quot;, whereby the husband, being the money-earner, would only visit Canada once or twice a year, usually during December or the summer months, but the rest of his family would live in Canada.

The Chinese community also sought redress for past injustices done against them. Since the early 1980s, there has been a campaign to redress the Head Tax paid by Chinese entering Canada from 1885 to 1923, led by the CCNC. However, the movement did not gather enough support to be noticed by the government until the 1990s. Still, the government was largely resistant to the calls of apologizing and refunding the head tax to the payers or their descendants. Canadian courts also ruled that while the government had no legal obligation to redress the head tax, it had a moral obligation to do so. The Liberal governments of the 1990s adopted the position of &quot;no apology, no compensation&quot; as the basis of negotiating with the Chinese groups and were criticized for stonewalling the Chinese community.

==== Immigrants from Hong Kong, late 1990s ====
With the political uncertainties as Hong Kong headed towards 1997, many residents of Hong Kong chose to immigrate to Canada, as it was relatively easier for them to enter the country due to their Commonwealth of Nations connections. It was also relatively easier for Hong Kongers to migrate to Canada than to the US, as the latter set fixed quotas for different nationalities, while Canada ran on a &quot;points&quot; system, allowing immigrants to arrive if they have desirable factors such as graduate degrees, training, funds to start new businesses and language abilities.

According to statistics compiled by the Canadian Consulate in Hong Kong, from 1991 to 1996, &quot;about 30,000 Hong Kongers emigrated annually to Canada, comprising over half of all Hong Kong emigration and about 20% of the total number of immigrants to Canada.&quot; The great majority of these people settled in the Toronto and Vancouver areas, as there are well-established Chinese communities in those cities. After the Handover, there was a sharp decline in immigration numbers, possibly indicating a smooth transition towards political stability. In the years to come, the unemployment and underemployment of many Hong Kong immigrants in Canada prompted a stream of returning migrants.

==Immigration in the 21st century==

Today, Mainland China has taken over from Hong Kong as the largest source of Chinese immigration. A great number of immigrants have been Cantonese speakers, and a disproportionate representation of Cantonese over other Chinese immigrants is prevalent in many Chinese communities in Canada. The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) has also taken over from all countries and regions as the country sending the most immigrants to Canada.

According to statistics from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), between 1999 and 2009 the largest number of immigrants to Canada came from the PRC. CIC statistics for 2002 showed that the Canadian immigrants from the PRC averaged well over 30,000 immigrants per year, totaling an average of 15% of all immigrants to Canada. This trend showed no sign of slowing down, with an all-time high of 42,295 reached in 2005. By 2010, 36,580 immigrants from the Philippines surpassed the 30,195 from the PRC. Filipinos retained their status as the number one immigrant group to Canada in 2011 with 34,991. The PRC lagged behind with 28,696.

Chinese-Canadians have become more involved in politics, both provincially and federally. Douglas Jung (1957–1962) not only became the first Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) of Chinese and Asian descent in the House of Commons, but also the first member of a visible minority elected to the Parliament of Canada. In 1993, Raymond Chan became the first ethnic Chinese to be appointed into the cabinet, after winning the riding of Richmond in the 1993 federal election. Many Chinese-Canadians have run for office in subsequent federal elections:

* After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton) was elected in the 2006 federal election, representing the riding of Trinity—Spadina, and in 2023 became the leading candidate in the city of Toronto&#x27;s mayoral race.
* Alan Lowe became the first Chinese-Canadian Mayor of Victoria BC (1999–2008).
* Ida Chong was a Saanich municipal councilor in the Victoria BC region before being elected in 2001 as a BC provincial cabinet minister in Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell&#x27;s administration.
* The Bloc Québécois had an ethnic-Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle—Émard against Liberal Party leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
* Philip Lee became the first Asian Lieutenant-Governor in Manitoba.
* Norman Kwong, Canada&#x27;s first professional Chinese-Canadian football player, also became Alberta&#x27;s first Chinese Lieutenant-Governor.

Because of the influx of Chinese emigrants from the global diaspora, community organizations reflecting Chinese people from Cuba, India, Jamaica, Mauritius, Peru, and so on, have established a considerable presence in Canada. Immigrants from the PRC have organized into many associations. The Chinese Professionals Association of Canada (CPAC) reported having a membership of over 30,000 in 2019. In terms of education, the Chinese Canadian Historical Society of British Columbia was created in 2004 to educate the general public about Chinese people in Canada; the University of Toronto&#x27;s Richard Charles Lee Canada-Hong Kong Library is a dedicated resource centre for Chinese-Canadian studies; the Toronto-based Chinese Culture and Education Society of Canada teaches Chinese and aims to develop education and cultural exchanges between Canada and China.

=== Apology and redress, 2004–06 ===

During the 2004 federal election campaign, NDP leader Jack Layton pledged to issue an apology and compensation for the Exclusion-Era head tax. After the 2006 election, the newly elected Conservative Party indicated in its Throne Speech that it would provide a formal apology and appropriate redress to families affected by racist policies of the past. It concluded a series of National Consultations across Canada in 2006, from 21 to 30 April, in Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton, Montreal, and Winnipeg.

The Liberal Party, which lost the 2006 election (as the outgoing government) changed their positions and were accused of &quot;flip-flopping&quot; on the issue during the election campaign as well as being questioned about their sincerity. Many Chinese, particularly the surviving head-tax payers and their descendants criticized Raymond Chan, the Chinese-Canadian cabinet minister who was left in charge of settling the matter, for compromising the Chinese community in favour of the government and misleading the public.

On 22 June 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered a message of redress in the House of Commons, offering an apology in Cantonese and compensation for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants. Survivors or their spouses were paid approximately in compensation. Although their children were not offered this payment, Chinese Canadian leaders like Joseph Wong regarded it as an important and significant move in Chinese Canadian history. There were about 20 people who paid the tax still alive in 2006.

<text>Quiche ( ) is a French tart consisting of a pastry crust filled with savoury custard and pieces of cheese, meat, seafood or vegetables. A well-known variant is quiche lorraine, which includes lardons or bacon. Quiche may be served hot, warm or cold.

==Overview==
===Etymology===
The word is first attested in French in 1805, and in 1605 in Lorrain patois. The first English usage — &quot;quiche lorraine&quot; — was recorded in 1925. The further etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to the German &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;cake&quot; or &quot;tart&quot;.

===History===

Recipes for eggs and cream baked in pastry containing meat, fish and fruit are referred to as &quot;Crustardes of flesh&quot; and &quot;Crustade&quot; in the 14th-century, English Cookbook, &quot;The Forme of Cury.&quot; As there have been other local medieval preparations in Central Europe, from the east of France to Austria, that resemble quiche. In 1586, a quiche like dish was served at a dinner for Charles III, Duke of Lorraine. The 19th century noun Quiche later being given to a French dish originating from the eastern part of the country. It may derive from an older preparation called &quot;féouse&quot; typical in the city of Nancy in the 16th century. The early versions of quiche were made of bread dough but today shortcrust and puff pastry are used. 

The American writer and cookery teacher James Peterson recorded first encountering quiche in the late 1960s and being &quot;convinced it was the most sophisticated and delicious thing [he had] ever tasted&quot;. He wrote that, by the 1980s, American quiches had begun to include ingredients he found &quot;bizarre and unpleasant&quot;, such as broccoli, and that he regarded Bruce Feirstein&#x27;s satirical book &quot;Real Men Don&#x27;t Eat Quiche&quot; (1982) as the &quot;final humiliation&quot; of the dish, such that &quot;[a] rugged and honest country dish had become a symbol of effete snobbery&quot;.

==Varieties==
A quiche usually has a pastry crust and a filling of eggs with milk or cream or both. It may be made with vegetables, meat or seafood, and be served hot, warm or cold. Types of quiches include:

In her &quot;French Country Cooking&quot; (1951), Elizabeth David gives a recipe for a &quot;quiche aux pommes de terre&quot;, in which the case is made not from shortcrust pastry but from mashed potato, flour and butter; the filling is cream, Gruyère and garlic.

<doc id="213224" wikidata="Q1324090" url="?curid=213224" title="Shadow of the Vampire">
<text>Shadow of the Vampire is a 2000 independent period vampire Gothic mystery film directed by E. Elias Merhige and written by Steven Katz. The film stars John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe. It is a fictionalized account of the making of the classic vampire film &quot;Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens&quot;, directed by F. W. Murnau, during which the film crew begin to have disturbing suspicions about their lead actor.

The film borrows the techniques of silent films, including the use of intertitles to explain elided action, and iris lenses. The film received positive reviews from critics and received nominations at the 73rd Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Best Supporting Actor for Dafoe&#x27;s performance.

==Plot==
In 1921, German director F. W. Murnau is shooting &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Murnau keeps his team in the dark about their schedule and the actor playing the vampire Count Orlok. It is left to the film&#x27;s other main actor, Gustav von Wangenheim, to explain that the lead is an obscure German theater performer named Max Schreck, who is a character actor. To involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear amongst the cast and crew in makeup, will only be filmed at night, and will never break character.

After filming scenes in a studio with leading actress Greta Schröder, Murnau takes his cast and crew to a remote inn in Czechoslovakia to film. The landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller, falls into a strange, hypnotic state. Gustav discovers a bottle of blood amongst the team&#x27;s food supplies, and someone delivers a caged ferret in the night to a not yet fully revealed Schreck.

One night, Murnau rushes his team to a nearby ancient Slovak castle for the first scene featuring Count Orlok. Schreck appears for the first time, and his appearance and behavior impress and disturb them. The film&#x27;s producer, Albin Grau, is confused when Murnau tells him that he originally found Schreck in the castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolfgang is found collapsed in the tunnel into which Schreck had receded.

While filming a dinner scene, Gustav accidentally cuts his finger. Schreck reacts wildly and tries drinking from Gustav&#x27;s wound. Grau orders filming ended for the night, and the crew rushes from the castle, leaving Schreck behind. Alone, Schreck examines the camera equipment, fascinated by footage of a sunrise. With Wolfgang near death, Murnau brings in another cameraman, Fritz Arno Wagner. Murnau threatens Schreck if he does not control himself in Murnau&#x27;s absence—a threat that Schreck challenges due to his immortality.

While Murnau returns to Berlin to calm financiers of the film, Schreck approaches Grau and the screenwriter, Henrik Galeen, who believe he is still in character. Schreck points out Dracula&#x27;s loneliness and the sadness of him trying to remember how to do otherwise mundane chores that he has not needed to perform for centuries. Schreck snatches a bat and sucks its blood. Grau and Galeen, thanks to their drunkenness on schnapps, are impressed by what they assume is talented acting. Later that night, Schreck kills a crewmember on the film&#x27;s set.

The production moves to the island of Heligoland to film the final scenes. Murnau, in a laudanum-induced stupor, admits to Grau and Fritz that Schreck is an actual vampire, and in return for his cooperation, Murnau has promised him Greta. The two realize they are trapped on the island, leaving no choice but to complete the film that night.

On set, Greta becomes hysterical after noticing that Schreck casts no reflection. Murnau, Grau, and Fritz drug her with laudanum and film as Schreck feeds on Greta, with the laudanum in her blood putting Schreck to sleep. At dawn, the three attempt to open a metal door and let in sunlight to destroy Schreck but discover that the vampire had cut the chain to the mechanism, trapping them. Fritz and Grau attack Schreck, only to be killed. Murnau resumes filming and, crazed, ignores the deaths of his colleagues.

Schreck returns to feed on Greta as Murnau films. Galeen and the crew arrive and lift the door, destroying Schreck with the sunlight. Having become obsessed with the film, Murnau asks for an end slate from his rattled crew. After they oblige, he stops the camera and calmly states, &quot;I think we have it.&quot;

==Production==
The premise of Count Orlok being played by an actual Nosferatu in the eponymous film was recorded by Ado Kyrou, who in his 1953 book &quot;Le Surréalisme au Cinéma&quot; incorrectly wrote: &quot;The credits name the music hall actor Max Schreck as the vampire&#x27;s performer, but it is well-known that this information is deliberately untrue. No one has ever been able to reveal the identity of this extraordinary actor whose brilliant face made him forever unrecognizable. [...] What is hidden behind the character of Nosferatu? Could it be Nosferatu himself?&quot; Although ill-informed, Kyrou&#x27;s notion that the screen monster was also a real-life monster would popularize the mystery around &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.

The film was produced by Nicolas Cage&#x27;s Saturn Films. Cage originally intended to play Schreck, but later cast Dafoe when he expressed interest in the role. Cage stated he always wanted Malkovich as Murnau. Cage has previously acted with Malkovich in &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997) and Dafoe in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990). Members of the online game the Hollywood Stock Exchange were able to donate a small sum towards the film&#x27;s production in exchange for listing their names on the DVD release of the film as &quot;virtual producers&quot;.

The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Burned to Light&quot;, but Merhige decided to change the name of the film when Dafoe asked, &quot;Who&#x27;s Ed?&quot;; the actor thought the title was &quot;Burn Ed to Light&quot;. To create the aesthetic of old film, cinematographer Lou Bogue shot much of the film with Kodak Vision 800T film stock – a high speed specialty stock with very coarse grain – in Super 35mm format, which further enhanced the effect when cropped and enlarged to anamorphic.

==Release==
&quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; had its world premiere at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. It was given a limited release in the United States on December 29, 2000. It was released on DVD in widescreen format on March 29, 2001. On January 5, 2010, In2Film released the film on Region 2 DVD.

==Reception==
Critical reaction has been mostly positive with Dafoe&#x27;s performance as Schreck/Orlok receiving particular praise. The film holds an 82% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 7.0/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; is frightening, compelling, and funny, and features an excellent performance by Willem Dafoe.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 71 out of 100 rating, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, writing that &quot;director E. Elias Merhige and his writer, Steven Katz, do two things at the same time. They make a vampire movie of their own, and they tell a backstage story about the measures that a director will take to realize his vision&quot;, and that Dafoe &quot;embodies the Schreck of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; so uncannily that when real scenes from the silent classic are slipped into the frame, we don&#x27;t notice a difference.&quot; Ebert later awarded the film his Special Jury Prize on his list of &quot;The Best 10 Movies of 2000&quot;, writing of Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;astonishing performance&quot; and of the film, &quot;Avoiding the pitfall of irony; it plays the material straight, which is truly scary.&quot;

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;You can find diversion in an improbable blend of behind-the-scenes satire and art-house fright-fest, anchored by Willem Dafoe&#x27;s creepy, comical and oddly moving performance as the blood-sucking Schreck.&quot;

<text>The second USS &quot;Tennessee&quot; (ACR-10), also referred to as &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 10&quot;, and later renamed Memphis, was a United States Navy armored cruiser, the lead ship of her class.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tennessee&quot; was laid down by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 20 June 1903, launched on 3 December 1904, sponsored by Ms. Annie K. Frazier (daughter of Governor James B. Frazier of Tennessee and later the foundress of the Society of Sponsors of the United States Navy), and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 July 1906, Captain Albert Gleaves Berry in command.

==Operational career==
The new armored cruiser departed Hampton Roads on 8 November 1906 as escort for in which President Theodore Roosevelt had embarked for a cruise to Panama to check on the progress of work constructing the Panama Canal. After a brief visit to Puerto Rico on the return voyage, the warships arrived back at Hampton Roads on 26 November.

Following a yard period for repairs, &quot;Tennessee&quot; left Hampton Roads on 16 April 1907 for the Jamestown Exposition, held from 7 to 11 June 1907, to commemorate the tricentennial of the founding of the first English settlement in America.

On 14 June, &quot;Tennessee&quot; sailed for Europe in company with and reached Royan, France on the 23rd for duty with the Special Service Squadron. She returned home in August but departed Hampton Roads on 12 October for the Pacific, where she became flagship for the second division of the Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; then patrolled off the California coast until 24 August 1908 but suffered a boiler tube explosion on 5 June, which killed seven men, while steaming at full speed. The explosion occurred just after the rear admiral in charge of the squadron had visited on a tour of inspection; had the explosion taken place a few minutes earlier, he might have been among the casualties. Since the ship&#x27;s 16 boilers were sub-divided into separate watertight compartments, the rest of the engineering section was not affected. Once repairs had been made and her tour had ended, &quot;Tennessee&quot; sailed for Samoa, arriving at Pago Pago on 23 September to resume service with the Pacific Fleet. On 15 May 1910, she arrived at Bahía Blanca to represent the United States at the centenary celebration of the independence of Argentina.

On 8 November 1910, the armored cruiser departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, to embark President William Howard Taft for a round trip voyage to Panama to inspect further progress on the canal. She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 November and then engaged in battle practice off the Virginia coast into February 1911. Following a Mardi Gras visit to New Orleans and a visit to New York City early in March, the ship steamed to Cuban waters for two months of operations out of Guantanamo Bay.

Placed in reserve at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 15 June 1911, she remained on the east coast for 18 months before departing Philadelphia on 12 November 1912 for the Mediterranean. Arriving off Smyrna (now İzmir), Turkey on 1 December, she remained there protecting American citizens and property during the First Balkan War until 3 May 1913, when she headed home. After reaching Hampton Roads on the 23rd, &quot;Tennessee&quot; operated on the East Coast until entering the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 23 October. On 2 May 1914, she became receiving ship at the New York Navy Yard.

On 4 November, &quot;Tennessee&quot; arrived in Beirut, what was then Syria, to protect the Christian population there in case of attack by Syrian Muslims.

On 6 August, &quot;Tennessee&quot; sailed from New York for duty in Europe through the first half of 1915 supporting the American Relief Expedition by carrying gold bullion and other resources to assist in the extraction of American refugees from war-ravaged Europe. In August, she transported the 1st Regiment, Marine Expeditionary Force, and the Marine Artillery Battalion to Haiti. From 28 January-24 February 1916, the cruiser served as flagship of a cruiser squadron off Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In March, she embarked a group of dignitaries at Hampton Roads for a two-month, round trip cruise to Montevideo, Uruguay.

On 25 May 1916, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was renamed Memphis, honoring the city of Memphis, Tennessee, so that the name &quot;Tennessee&quot; could be reassigned to the new battleship .

In July 1916, under the command of Captain Edward L. Beach, Sr., the ship got underway for the Caribbean arriving at Santo Domingo on 23 July for peace-keeping patrol off the rebellion-torn Dominican Republic.

==Loss==
&quot;Memphis&quot; was at anchor off a rocky beach in of water in the harbor of Santo Domingo on the afternoon of 29 August 1916 with two of her 16 boilers operating in case she needed to get underway; the gunboat also was anchored in the harbor. Shortly after 12:00, &quot;Memphis&quot; began to roll heavily and Captain Beach observed an unexpected heavy swell developing. &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Castine&quot; both made preparations to leave the harbor and began to raise steam; &quot;Memphis&quot; expected to be able to get underway at about 16:35.

Conditions in the harbor had deteriorated badly by 15:45, when &quot;Memphis&quot; sighted an approaching wave of yellow water stretching along the entire horizon. By 16:00, the wave was closer, had turned ochre in color, and had reached about in height; at the same time, &quot;Memphis&quot; was rolling 45°, so heavily that large amounts of water cascaded into the ship via her gun ports and water even was entering the ship via ventilators above the waterline. By 16:25, water began to enter the ship via her funnels, above the waterline, putting out the fires in her boilers and preventing her from raising enough steam to get underway. She began to strike the rocky harbor bottom at 16:40, damaging her propellers just as she was raising enough steam to begin moving, and her engines lost steam pressure.

At about this time, the giant wave &quot;Memphis&quot; had seen approaching over the past hour arrived; she rolled into a deep trough and was struck immediately by what proved to be three very large waves in rapid succession, the highest of them estimated by the crew to have been in height, completely swamping her except for her highest points, and washing crewmen overboard. The waves rolled her heavily, caused her to strike the harbor bottom, then pushed her to the beach away. By 17:00, she had been driven under cliffs along the coast of the harbor and was resting on the harbor bottom. She was battered into a complete wreck in 90 minutes. &quot;Castine&quot;, meanwhile, managed to reach safer waters by getting underway and putting to sea through the large waves, although damaged by them and at times in danger of capsizing.

&quot;Memphis&quot;″s casualties numbered 43 men dead or missing – 10 of them washed overboard by the waves or killed by steam as the ship&#x27;s powerplant broke up, another 25 lost as they returned from shore leave in the ship&#x27;s motor launch and were caught in the harbor by the huge breakers, and eight more lost in three boats wrecked after dark as they attempted to reach shore – and 204 badly injured. Due to their heroic actions during this incident, Chief Machinist&#x27;s Mate George William Rud, Lieutenant Claud Ashton Jones, and Machinist Charles H. Willey were awarded the Medal of Honor.
===Alternative explanations for the wreck===
In his 1966 account of the incident, &quot;The Wreck of the Memphis&quot;, Captain Beach″s son, Edward L. Beach Jr., ascribed her loss to an unexpected tsunami exceeding in height, and this explanation has been carried forward by most sources discussing her loss. More recent research, however, has called this explanation into question. No record of any seismic event in the Caribbean on 29 August 1916 that could have triggered a tsunami has been found, and the rate of advance of the large wave &quot;Memphis&quot; reported – about an hour to cross the distance from the horizon to the ship – matches that of a wind-generated ocean wave (possibly a rogue wave); a tsunami, in contrast, would have covered the distance in only a few minutes. The periods of the three large waves that struck &quot;Memphis&quot; also are characteristic of large wind-generated waves rather than tsunamis.

A likely source for such large, wind-generated waves in Santo Domingo Harbor on 29 August 1916 does exist, in that three hurricanes active in the Caribbean between 12 August and 2 September 1916 passed westward just to the south. Waves generated from these storms could well have combined to create a large wave like those that struck and wrecked &quot;Memphis&quot;. Such a circumstance appears to explain the loss of the ship better than the tsunami theory. Oceanographer Dr. George Pararas-Carayannis in particular published an extensively detailed rebuttal demonstrating that a tsunami could not have caused the foundering of &quot;Memphis&quot;, but that the last of the three hurricanes, category 1 Hurricane Eight, likely did, creating a wave that reached a breaker height of as it approached &quot;Memphis&quot;. This swamped the cruiser, anchored in only of water, and would have done so even had the ship been at full maneuvering power. Pararas-Carayannis concluded that had &quot;Memphis&quot; been anchored in of water, she would have ridden out the swells, including the killer wave.

==Salvage efforts==

Although &quot;Memphis&quot; came to rest upright and appeared relatively undamaged above the waterline, it was apparent as early as the day after the disaster that she was not worth repairing; she was outdated by 1916, she had suffered the destruction of her propulsion plant and severe distortion of her hull structure, and her bottom had been driven in. Accordingly, the United States Department of the Navy assigned the crew of the battleship , or the wrecking vessel &quot;Henlopen&quot;, to strip her of her guns, supplies, and equipment for use on other ships. &quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s crew left &quot;Memphis&quot; without her guns, with much of her topside gear missing, and with her gun turrets rotated off the centerline.

&quot;Memphis&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell was presented to a local church as a gesture of thanks to citizens of Santo Domingo who had helped to rescue the ship&#x27;s crew.

==Final disposition==
&quot;Memphis&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 December 1917 and sold to the A. H. Radetsky Iron and Metal Company of Denver, Colorado, on 17 January 1922 for scrapping for the sum of $3,000 (US$ in 2025). Scrapped on site, her wreck proved difficult to dismantle, and the last of it did not disappear from the Santo Domingo shoreline until 1938.

Her bronze bow scrollwork, removed approximately 1909, is on display on a concrete mockup of her bow in Nashville, Tennessee&#x27;s Centennial Park.

<text>Mercury-Redstone 3, or Freedom 7, was the first United States human spaceflight, on May 5, 1961, piloted by astronaut Alan Shepard. It was the first crewed flight of Project Mercury. The project had the ultimate objective of putting an astronaut into orbit around the Earth and returning him safely. Shepard&#x27;s mission was a 15-minute suborbital flight with the primary objective of demonstrating his ability to withstand the high g-forces of launch and atmospheric re-entry.

Shepard named his space capsule &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, setting a precedent for the remaining six Mercury astronauts naming their spacecraft and the format of their names, the number 7 later included in all the crewed Mercury spacecraft names not to honor NASA&#x27;s first group of seven astronauts but it stood for the McDonnell Model #7 space capsule used in the Mercury Program. His spacecraft reached an altitude of 101.2 nautical miles (116.5 statute miles, 187.5 km) and traveled a downrange distance of 263.1 nautical miles (302.8 statute miles, 487.3 km). It was the fourth Mercury flight launched with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, close to the Atlantic Ocean.

During the flight, Shepard observed the Earth and tested the capsule&#x27;s attitude control system, turning the capsule around to face its blunt heat shield forward for atmospheric re-entry. He also tested the retrorockets which would return later missions from orbit, though the capsule did not have enough energy to remain in orbit. After re-entry, the capsule landed by parachute on the North Atlantic Ocean off the Bahamas. Shepard and the capsule were picked up by helicopter and brought to U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;&quot;.

The mission was a technical success, though American pride in the accomplishment was dampened by the fact that just three weeks before, the Soviet Union had launched the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, who completed one orbit on Vostok 1. In 2017 the first National Astronaut Day was held on May 5 to pay tribute to this first U.S. flight.

==Preparation==

The spacecraft for MR-3, Mercury capsule #7, was delivered to Cape Canaveral on December 9, 1960. It had originally been expected that a mission could be launched soon after the spacecraft was available, but Capsule #7 turned out to require extensive development and testing work before it was deemed safe for flight. However, as it had been earmarked since the summer as the first crewed spacecraft, the decision was taken to delay the mission until this particular capsule was ready, with a tentative launch date of March 6, rather than use an alternative capsule. The booster originally intended for the flight, Redstone #3, had been delivered to the Cape in early December; however, it was then used on the MR-1A test flight on December 19. The replacement, Redstone #7, did not arrive at the Cape until late March; by this time, however, the mission had already been postponed to await the results of another test flight.

In late 1960, there had been a growing number of concerns about the safety of the Redstone launch vehicle; the MR-2 test flight, carrying Ham the chimpanzee, had experienced technical problems during the launch, leading to the spacecraft flying too high, too far and too fast. As a result, the mission was two minutes longer than planned, and the re-entry subjected Ham to 14.7g rather than the planned figure of approximately 12g. The splashdown point was sixty miles from the nearest recovery ship, and it was over two and a half hours before a helicopter could recover the capsule and its passenger – by which time it had almost sunk. As a result, NASA was unwilling to launch the MR-3 mission without further development work; by late February, there were still seven major alterations they had made to the booster which required testing. An additional testing flight was accordingly added to the schedule, MR-BD (for &quot;Booster Development&quot;; it was originally known as MR-2A). This would launch on March 28, pushing the MR-3 flight back a month to April 25. The MR-BD flight was almost completely successful, ensuring that the crewed MR-3 flight could proceed without further significant delay.

The pilot for MR-3 had been chosen several months in advance, in early January, by the head of the program, Robert R. Gilruth. He had selected Alan Shepard (Navy) as the primary pilot, with John Glenn (Marine) and Gus Grissom (Air Force) as his backups; the other members of the Mercury Seven continued to train for later missions. The three names were announced to the press on February 22 without any indication as to which of the three was expected to fly the mission. Shepard&#x27;s name was only announced publicly after the initial launch attempt had been canceled, as Gilruth wished to keep his options open in the event that last-minute personnel changes were required. Glenn served as Shepard&#x27;s backup on launch day, with Grissom focusing on training for MR-4, the next suborbital mission.

==Naming==
Captain Shepard dubbed his capsule &quot;Freedom 7&quot;. Per Shepard, &quot;Pilots have always named their planes. It&#x27;s a tradition. It never occurred to me &quot;not&quot; to name the capsule.&quot; Shepard discussed the name with his wife, Louise, backup pilot John Glenn, and Robert R. Gilruth, and all liked it.

Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;7&quot; was not a reference to the seven original astronauts selected for Mercury but rather to the fact that Shepard&#x27;s spacecraft was factory model no. 7. However, the other astronauts liked the symbolism, and each appended 7 to their spacecraft names as well. Thus, Shepard set a double precedent, both for naming the Mercury spacecraft at all, and for the common structure of their naming.

==Flight==
The initial launch attempt, on May 2, was canceled due to weather problems two hours and 20 minutes before the launch time, with Shepard waiting in a hangar already suited and prepared. The flight was rescheduled for two days later, when it was delayed one more day due to inclement weather conditions, until 5 May, with an expected launch time of 7:20 am. EST.

The countdown began at 8:30 p.m. the previous night, with Shepard waking up and eating a breakfast of steak and eggs with toast, coffee, and orange juice (the steak and eggs breakfast would soon become a tradition for astronauts the morning of a launch). He entered the spacecraft at 5:15 am. ET, just over two hours before the planned 7:20 launch time. At 7:05 am, the launch was held for an hour to let cloud cover clear – good visibility would be essential for photographs of the Earth – and fix a power supply unit; shortly after the count restarted, another hold was called in order to reboot a computer at Goddard Space Flight Center. The count was eventually resumed, after slightly over two and a half hours of unplanned holds, and continued with no further faults. All of the delays resulted in Shepard lying on his back in the capsule for almost three hours, by which point he complained to the blockhouse crew that he had a severe need to urinate (because the mission would last under 20 minutes, nobody had thought to equip the Mercury with a urine collection device). The crew told him that this was impossible as they would have to set the White Room back up and waste considerable amounts of time removing the Mercury&#x27;s heavily bolted hatch. An irate Shepard then announced that if he could not get out for a bathroom trip, he would simply urinate in his suit. When the blockhouse protested that that would short out the medical electrodes on his body, he told them to simply turn the power off. They complied, and Shepard emptied his bladder. Because of the position he was sitting in, the urine pooled somewhat underneath his back and with oxygen flowing through the spacesuit, he was soon dried out, and the countdown resumed.

Mercury-Redstone 3 finally lifted off at 9:34 am. ET, watched by an estimated 45 million television viewers in the United States. Shepard was subjected to a maximum acceleration of 6.3g just before the Redstone engine shut down, two minutes and 22 seconds after launch. &quot;Freedom 7&#x27;s&quot; space-fixed velocity was , close to the planned value. Upon shutdown of the booster, the escape tower was jettisoned. Ten seconds later came capsule separation: the capsule detonated the explosive bolts on the Marman clamping ring that joined it to the booster and fired its posigrade rockets to gain distance. After capsule separation, the automated attitude control system (the Automatic Stabilization Control System, or ASCS) damped out any residual tumbling motions and then yawed &quot;Freedom 7&quot; around 180 degrees, so the retrorockets would face forward ready for firing.

Shepard now began testing manual control of the spacecraft&#x27;s orientation. For redundancy purposes, the Mercury spacecraft&#x27;s manual attitude control system used a different set of control jets than the automatic system and had its own fuel supply; when the system was activated, moving the three-axis control stick proportionally opened valves to the manual jets. The system could be selectively enabled on each axis, with ASCS automatically controlling the non-enabled axes. Shepard gradually assumed manual control, one axis at a time, leaving the remaining axes to ASCS. First he took manual control of pitch, reorienting the spacecraft from its &quot;orbit attitude&quot; of 14 degrees nose-down pitch to the retrofire attitude of 34 degrees nose-down pitch, then returning to orbit attitude. He then took manual control of yaw along with pitch, yawing the spacecraft to the left and then to the right to bring it back in line. Finally he assumed control of roll as well, testing it and then restoring the spacecraft&#x27;s roll to normal. Once Shepard had taken control of all three axes, he found that the spacecraft&#x27;s manual response was about the same as that of the Mercury simulator; however, he could not hear the jets firing, as he could on the ground, due to the levels of background noise.

Shepard&#x27;s next task was to make observations of the ground from the spacecraft&#x27;s periscope, which extended through the &quot;bottom&quot; of the hull beneath his feet. Shepard&#x27;s craft, an earlier version of the Mercury capsule, also had two small round viewing windows, one on each side, but the periscope was its primary means for observing. The periscope could be set either to a low-magnification wide-angle view or to a high-magnification narrow-angle view, and different optical filters could be inserted by turning a knob. During his long wait on the launch pad, Shepard had inserted a medium-gray filter in the periscope to cut down on sun glare, but he had not had time to undo this before launch. He found that when he tried to reach the filter knob to change it, the wrist of his spacesuit would bump the handle by his left hand that would manually activate the launch escape system. Even though the escape tower was long gone, Shepard gave up on trying to change the filter out of caution, leaving it in for the rest of the flight. Although the gray filter washed out colors, Shepard was still easily able to distinguish major land masses from clouds. He reported identifying major features such as the east coast of Florida, Lake Okeechobee, and Andros Island, the largest island of the Bahamas, but cloud cover made it difficult for him to make out other Bahamian islands.

With the spacecraft still under manual control, but now using the periscope rather than the panel instruments for his attitude reference, Shepard had maintained his roll and yaw attitude, but he had inadvertently let the spacecraft drift in pitch. As the spacecraft approached the highest point of its suborbital arc, the &quot;start retro sequence&quot; light came on, alerting Shepard that the three retrorockets were about to fire. They would do this in sequence five seconds apart, burning for ten seconds each. Shepard began adjusting his pitch nose downward toward the proper retrofire attitude of –34 degrees, but he only got to around orbit attitude (–14 degrees) before the first retrorocket fired. He then got his pitch further down to about –25 degrees in time for the second and third retrorockets. This pitch discrepancy was not critical for this flight, because Shepard&#x27;s suborbital trajectory would lead to reentry anyway, and the difference in pitch wouldn&#x27;t affect Shepard&#x27;s landing location much; Shepard was only testing the pilot&#x27;s ability to manually control the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude during retrofire. In his initial postflight debriefing, Shepard reported that he must have somehow gotten confused about his pitch attitude, but as it turned out he was the victim of a misunderstanding. This particular spacecraft&#x27;s pitch indicator had originally been set so that its reference position for retrofire attitude, which was the &quot;nine o&#x27;clock&quot; position on the indicator, was at –43 degrees pitch, rather than the –34 degrees later decided upon for retrofire. Shepard had assumed it was still set that way and deliberately adjusted his pitch high to compensate. But in fact the indicator had been changed, with the &quot;nine o&#x27;clock&quot; reference position being updated to the correct –34 degrees. Somehow Shepard had not been informed, so his compensation made his pitch too high.

Just after retrofire, Shepard switched into the &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; control mode, where the pilot&#x27;s motions of the three-axis control stick electrically triggered the control jets of the automatic system to fire for the desired positioning, rather than proportionally opening the manual system&#x27;s control jets. Soon afterward, the retrorocket pack was automatically jettisoned. This pack was attached over the heatshield by straps and so was normally released before reentry. Shepard heard the noise of the jettison and saw one of the straps fly past a window, but the confirmation light did not turn on. However, fellow Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton, who was acting as capsule communicator (&quot;CAPCOM&quot;) in the Mercury Control Center, confirmed to Shepard that the pack had jettisoned, so Shepard activated the manual override for the jettison system to trigger the light. It was later determined that the retro-jettison light hadn&#x27;t activated because of an issue with the electrically triggered pyrotechnic &quot;squibs&quot; that were fired to release the retrorocket pack. These squibs, when triggered, could draw excessive current from the electrical system, dropping its voltage to the point that the timer which was supposed to activate the retro-jettison light got reset. The squibs were modified to prevent this problem in future missions.

Shepard reported that fly-by-wire felt smooth and gave the sensation of being fully in command of the craft, before letting the automatic systems briefly take over to reorient the capsule for reentry. He then kept control until the g-forces peaked at 11.6g during re-entry; he held the capsule until it had stabilized and then relinquished control to the automated system. The descent was faster than anticipated, but the parachutes deployed as planned, a drogue at and a main parachute at .

Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. &quot;Freedom 7&quot; tilted over on its right side about 60 degrees from an upright position, but did not show any signs of leaking; it gently righted itself after a minute, and Shepard was able to report to the circling aircraft that he had landed safely and was ready to be recovered. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and after a brief problem with the spacecraft antenna, the capsule was lifted partly out of the water in order to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and his spacecraft to a waiting aircraft carrier, . The whole recovery process had taken only eleven minutes, from splashdown to arriving aboard.

The flight lasted 15 minutes, 22 seconds and the spacecraft traveled from its launch point, ascending to . &quot;Freedom 7&quot; landed at these coordinates: . It reached a speed of . Besides that, the spaceflight mission featured the first manual pilot control of the spacecraft.

Following the flight the spacecraft was examined by engineers and found to be in excellent shape, so much so that they decided it could have been safely used again in another launch. Given to the Smithsonian Institution by NASA, &quot;Freedom 7&quot; was previously displayed at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland until 2012. In 2012, it was on display at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. Beginning on May 5, 2021, the 60th Anniversary of the First American in Space, the Mercury-Redstone (MR-3) spacecraft &quot;Freedom 7&quot; was on display and exhibited at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center located in Chantilly, Virginia. It currently is on display at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum located in Washington, D.C.

==Depiction in popular culture==
In June 1961, Laurie Records issued a 45 rpm single featuring William Allen and Orchestra entitled &quot;Space Flight Freedom 7&quot;. It consisted of recreations of the tower to astronaut communications spoken over an instrumental backing.

The Mercury-Redstone 3 mission was dramatized in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Philip Kaufman&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; based on the book (Scott Glenn plays Shepard), the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; episode &quot;Can We Do This?&quot; (starring Ted Levine as Shepard) and the 2016 film &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; (Dane Davenport plays Shepard). In the 2020 mini-series &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Jake McDorman plays Shepard.

In the 2008 video game &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, the player can visit the Museum of Technology in the ruins of Washington D.C., two centuries after a nuclear war. The game takes place in an alternate timeline that diverges from reality after World War II. In the museum is an exhibit about a slightly different version of Mercury-Redstone 3/&quot;Freedom 7&quot; called &quot;Defiance 7&quot; that launched on May 5, 1961 (the day &quot;Freedom 7&quot; was launched) and was piloted by fictional astronaut Carl Bell. The exhibit states that Bell was the first human in space in this timeline and did not survive the space flight, having died in a crash landing. His skeleton and space suit were donated to the museum and are on display there.

<text>Mercury-Redstone 4 was the second United States human spaceflight, on July 21, 1961. The suborbital Project Mercury flight was launched with a Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle, MRLV-8. The spacecraft, Mercury capsule #11, was nicknamed Liberty Bell 7. It was piloted by astronaut Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom.

The spaceflight lasted 15 minutes 30 seconds, reached an altitude of more than , and flew downrange, landing in the Atlantic Ocean. The flight went as expected until just after splashdown, when the hatch cover, designed to release explosively in the event of an emergency, accidentally blew. Grissom was at risk of drowning, but was recovered safely via a U.S. Navy helicopter. The spacecraft sank into the Atlantic and was not recovered until 1999.

==Mission parameters==
* Mass: 1 286 kg
* Maximum altitude: 190.39 km
* Range: 486.15 km
* Launch vehicle: Redstone rocket

==Spacecraft==
The MR-4 spacecraft, Mercury capsule #11, was designated to fly the second crewed suborbital flight in October 1960. It came off McDonnell&#x27;s St. Louis production line in May 1960. Capsule #11 was the first Mercury operational spacecraft with a centerline window instead of two portholes. It was closer to the final orbital version than was Alan Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Freedom 7&quot;. Dubbed &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; by its pilot, it featured a white, diagonal, irregular paint stripe starting at the base of the capsule and extending about two-thirds toward the nose, emulating the crack in the famed Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

===Explosive hatch===
&quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; also had a new explosive hatch release. This would allow an astronaut to exit the spacecraft quickly in the event of an emergency. Emergency personnel could also trigger the explosive hatch from outside the spacecraft by pulling on an external lanyard. Both the pop-off hatch and the lanyard are standard features of ejection seats used in military aircraft, but in the Mercury design, the pilot still had to exit the craft himself, or be removed by emergency personnel. The original exit procedure was to climb out through the antenna compartment, after removing a small pressure bulkhead. This was a difficult and slow procedure. Removal of an injured or unconscious astronaut through the top hatch would be nearly impossible. The original side hatch was bolted shut with 70 bolts and covered with several spacecraft shingles, making it a slow process to open the original hatch.

McDonnell Aircraft engineers devised two different quick release hatches for the Mercury spacecraft. The first had a latch, and was used on Ham&#x27;s (a chimpanzee) MR-2 and Shepard&#x27;s MR-3 missions. The second design was an explosive release hatch. The quick release latching hatch weighed 69 lb (31 kg), too much of a weight addition to use on the orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch design used the 70 bolts of the original design, but each quarter-inch (6.35 mm) titanium bolt had a hole bored into it to provide a weak point. A mild detonating fuse (MDF) was installed in a channel between the inner and outer seal around the periphery of the hatch. When the MDF was ignited, the resulting gas pressure between the inner and outer seal would cause the bolts to fail in tension.

There were two ways to fire the explosive hatch during recovery. On the inside of the hatch was a knobbed plunger. The pilot could remove a pin and press the plunger with a force of 5 or 6 lbf (25 N). This would detonate the explosive charge, which would shear off the 70 bolts and propel the hatch away in one second. If the pin was left in place, a force of 40 lbf (180 N) was required to detonate the bolts. An outside rescuer could blow open the hatch by removing a small panel near the hatch and pulling a lanyard. The explosive hatch weighed .

===Window===
The new trapezoidal window on &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; replaced the two side portholes that were on Freedom 7. The Corning Glass Works of Corning, New York designed and developed the multilayered panes that comprised the new window. The outer pane was thick Vycor glass. It could withstand temperatures of . The inner pane was made of three inner glass panels bonded to form a single inner pane. One panel was a thick sheet of Vycor, while the others were tempered glass. This new window assembly was as strong as any part of the spacecraft pressure vessel.

===Controls===
The manual controls of &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; incorporated a new rate stabilization control system. This allowed fine control of spacecraft attitude movements by small turns of the hand controller. Previously a lot of jockeying of the device was needed to maintain the desired attitude. This rate damping, or rate augmentation system, gave finer and easier handling qualities and a redundant means of firing the pitch, yaw, and roll thrusters.

Before the Mercury-Redstone 4 mission, Lewis Research Center and Space Task Group engineers had determined that firing the posigrade rockets into the booster-spacecraft adapter, rather than in the open, developed 78 percent greater thrust. This achieved a greater spacecraft-booster separation through a kind of &quot;pop-gun&quot; effect. By using this technique, the spacecraft separated at velocity of about rather than using the old procedure. The Mercury-Redstone 4/&quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; mission would take advantage of this new procedure.

Additional hardware changes to &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; were a redesigned fairing for the spacecraft-Redstone adapter clamp-ring and additional foam padding added to the head area of the contour couch. The fairing changes and additional foam were used to reduce vibrations the pilot experienced during the boost phase of flight. The spacecraft instrument panel was rearranged to provide a better eye scan pattern.

==Naming==
Captain Grissom dubbed his capsule &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;, the seven in honor of the seven original astronauts selected for Mercury, a tradition inadvertently started by prior Mercury pilot, Alan Shepard, who incorporated the seven in &quot;Freedom 7&quot; as his spacecraft was factory model no. 7. The other astronauts liked the symbolism, and so each appended 7 to their spacecraft names as well. Grissom chose &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; due to the capsule&#x27;s resemblance to a bell, and because it evoked the iconic Liberty Bell. Grissom went as far as having the Liberty Bell on the spacecraft complete with the crack that characterizes the real bell. This detail motivated a degree of teasing of Grissom after the spacecraft sank in the ocean at the end of its mission.

==Mission description==
In January 1961, NASA&#x27;s Director of the Space Task Group, Robert Gilruth, told Gus Grissom that he would be the primary pilot for Mercury-Redstone 4. John Glenn was the backup pilot for the mission.

Redstone launch vehicle MRLV-8 arrived at Cape Canaveral on June 8, 1961. A mission review on July 15, 1961, pronounced Redstone MRLV-8 and Mercury spacecraft #11 ready to go for the Mercury-Redstone 
4 mission.

The Mercury 4 mission was planned as a repeat of MR-3. It was to reach an apogee of . The planned range was . Grissom would experience a maximum acceleration of 6.33 &quot;g&quot; (62 m/s) and deceleration of 10.96 &quot;g&quot; (107 m/s).

The launch of &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; was first planned for July 16. The cloud cover was too thick and the launch was postponed until July 18. On July 18, it was again postponed due to weather. Both times, the pilot had not yet boarded the spacecraft. On July 19, 1961, Grissom was on board when the flight was delayed again due to weather. At that point, it had just 10 minutes 30 seconds to go before launch.

On the morning of July 21, 1961, Gus Grissom entered the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; at 8:58 UTC and the 70 hatch bolts were put in place. At 45 minutes prior to the scheduled launch, a pad technician discovered that one of the hatch bolts was misaligned. During a 30-minute hold that was called, McDonnell and NASA Space Task Group engineers decided that the 69 remaining bolts should be sufficient to hold the hatch in place and blow it at the appropriate time. The misaligned bolt was not replaced.

&quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; was launched at 12:20:36 UTC, July 21, 1961.

===Launch===

Grissom later admitted at the postflight debriefing that he was &quot;a bit scared&quot; at liftoff, but he added that he soon gained confidence along with the acceleration increase. Hearing the engine roar at the pedestal, he thought that his elapsed-time clock had started late. Like Shepard, he was amazed at the smooth quality of the liftoff, but then he noticed gradually more severe vibrations. These were never violent enough to impair his vision.

Grissom&#x27;s cabin pressure sealed off at the proper altitude, about , and he felt elated that the environmental control system was in good working order. The cabin and suit temperatures, respectively about were quite comfortable. Watching his instruments for the pitch rate of the Redstone, Grissom saw it follow directions as programmed, tilting over at about one deg/s.

During a 3 &quot;g&quot; (29 m/s) acceleration on the up-leg of his flight, Grissom noticed a sudden change in the color of the horizon from light blue to jet black. His attention was distracted by the noise of the tower-jettison rocket firing on schedule. Grissom felt the separation, and he watched the tower through the window as it drifted off, trailing smoke, to his right. At two minutes and 22 seconds after launch, the Redstone&#x27;s Rocketdyne engine cut off after building a speed of . Grissom had a strong sensation of tumbling during the transition from high to zero acceleration, and, while he had become familiar with this sensation in centrifuge training, for a moment he lost his bearings.

The Redstone coasted for 10 seconds after its engine cut off; then a sharp report signaled that the posigrade rockets were popping the spacecraft loose from the booster. Although Grissom peered out his window throughout his ship&#x27;s turnaround maneuver, he never caught sight of his booster.

===Ballistic flight===
With turnaround accomplished, the Air Force jet pilot for the first time became a space pilot, assuming manual-proportional control. A constant urge to look out the window made concentrating on his control tasks difficult. He told Shepard back in Mercury Control that the panorama of Earth&#x27;s horizon, presenting an arc at peak altitude, was fascinating. His instruments rated a poor second to the spectacle below.

Turning reluctantly to his dials and control stick, Grissom made a pitch movement change, but was past his desired mark. He jockeyed the handcontroller stick for position, trying to damp out all oscillations, then made a yaw movement and went too far in that direction. By the time the proper attitude was attained, the short time allocated for these maneuvers had been used, so he omitted the roll movement altogether. Grissom found the manual controls very sluggish when compared to the Mercury procedures trainer. He then switched to the new rate command control system and found perfect response, although fuel consumption was high.

After the pitch and yaw maneuvers, Grissom made a roll-over movement so he could see the ground from his window. Some land beneath the clouds (later determined to be western Florida around the Apalachicola area) appeared in the hazy distance, but the pilot was unable to identify it. Suddenly Cape Canaveral came into view so clearly that Grissom found it hard to believe that his slant-range was over .

He saw Merritt Island, the Banana River, the Indian River, and what appeared to be a large airport runway. South of Cape Canaveral, he saw what he believed to be West Palm Beach.

===Reentry===
With &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; at an altitude of , it was now time to position the spacecraft in its reentry attitude. Grissom had initiated the retrorocket sequence and the spacecraft was arcing downward. His pulse reached 171 beats per minute. Retrofire gave him the distinct and peculiar feeling that he had reversed his backward flight through space and was actually moving face forward. As he plummeted downward, he saw what appeared to be two of the spent retrorockets pass across the periscope view after the retrorocket package had been jettisoned.

Pitching the spacecraft over into a reentry attitude of 14 degrees from Earth-vertical, the pilot tried to see the stars out his observation window. Instead the glare of sunlight filled his cabin, making it difficult to read the panel dials, particularly those with blue lights. Grissom thought that he would not have noticed the 0.05 &quot;g&quot; (0.5 m/s) light if he had not known it was about to flash on.

Reentry presented no problem. Grissom could not feel the oscillations following the acceleration buildup; he could only read them on the rate indicators. Meanwhile, he continued to report to the Mercury Control Center on his electric current reading, fuel quantity, acceleration, and other instrument indications. Condensation and smoke trailed off the heatshield at about as &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; plunged back into the atmosphere.

The drogue parachute deployed on schedule at . Grissom said he saw the deployment and felt some resulting pulsating motion, but not enough to worry him. Main parachute deployment occurred at , which was about higher than the design nominal altitude. Watching the main chute unfurl, Grissom spotted a L-shaped tear and another puncture in the canopy. Although he worried about them, the holes grew no bigger and his rate of descent soon slowed to about . Dumping his peroxide control fuel, the pilot began transmitting his panel readings.

===Splashdown===
A &quot;clunk&quot; confirmed that the landing bag had dropped in preparation for impact. Grissom then removed his oxygen hose and opened his visor, but deliberately left the suit ventilation hose attached. Impact was milder than he had expected, although the spacecraft heeled over in the water until Grissom was lying on his left side. He thought he was facing downward. The spacecraft gradually righted itself, and, as the window cleared the water, Grissom jettisoned the reserve parachute and activated the rescue aids switch. &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; still appeared to be watertight, although it was rolling badly with the swells.

Preparing for recovery, he disconnected his helmet and checked himself for debarkation. The neck dam did not unroll easily; Grissom tinkered with his suit collar to ensure his buoyancy in the event that he had to get out of the spacecraft quickly. When the recovery helicopters, which had taken to the air at launch time and visually followed the contrails and parachute descent, were still about from the impact point, which was only beyond the bullseye, Lieutenant James L. Lewis, the pilot of the primary recovery helicopter, radioed Grissom to ask if he was ready for pickup. He replied that he wanted them to wait five minutes while he recorded his cockpit panel data. Using a grease pencil with the pressure suit gloves was awkward, and several times the suit ventilation caused the neck dam to balloon, but Grissom simply placed his finger between neck and dam to allow the air to escape.

====Hatch blows open====

After logging the panel data, Grissom asked the helicopters to begin the approach for pickup. He removed the pin from the hatch-cover detonator and lay back in the couch. &quot;I was lying there, minding my own business,&quot; he said afterward, &quot;when I heard a dull thud.&quot; The hatch cover blew away, and salt water splashed into the spacecraft as it bobbed in the ocean. The capsule began taking on water and started to sink.

Grissom had difficulty recollecting his actions at this point, but he was certain that he had not touched the hatch-activation plunger. He had earlier unbuckled himself from most of his harness; he now removed his helmet, grasped the instrument panel with his right hand, and climbed though the hatchway.

The copilot of the nearest recovery helicopter said that as he was preparing, per procedure, to cut off the spacecraft&#x27;s antenna whip with a squib-actuated cutter at the end of a pole, the hatch cover flew off, struck the water about away, then skipped over the waves. Next he saw Grissom climb through the hatch and swim away.

====Failed spacecraft recovery====
Leaving aside the swimming astronaut, Lewis completed his approach to the sinking spacecraft, as both he and co-pilot John Reinhard were intent on spacecraft recovery. This action was a conditioned reflex based on past training experience. While training off the Virginia beaches the helicopter pilots had noted that the astronauts seemed at home in and to enjoy the water. So Reinhard quickly cut the high-frequency antenna as soon as the helicopter reached &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;. Throwing aside the antenna cutting device, Reinhard picked up the shepherd&#x27;s-hook recovery pole and carefully threaded the crook through the recovery loop on top of the spacecraft. By this time Lewis had lowered the helicopter to assist Reinhard in his task to a point that the helicopter&#x27;s three wheels were in the water. The capsule sank out of sight, but the pickup pole tangled as the attached cable went taut, indicating to the helicopter pilots that they had made the catch.

Reinhard immediately prepared to pass the floating astronaut the personnel hoist, but at that moment Lewis called a warning that a detector light had flashed on the instrument panel, indicating that metal chips were in the oil sump because of engine strain. Considering the implication of impending engine failure, Lewis told Reinhard to retract the personnel hoist while he called the second helicopter to retrieve Grissom.

Meanwhile, Grissom, having made certain that he was not snared by any lines, noticed that the primary helicopter was having trouble raising the submerged spacecraft. He swam back to the spacecraft to see if he could assist, but found the cable properly attached. When he looked up for the personnel line, he saw the helicopter start to move away.

Suddenly, Grissom realized that he was not riding as high in the water as he had been. All the time he had been in the water he kept feeling air escape through the neck dam. The more air he lost, the less buoyancy he had. Moreover, he had forgotten to secure his suit inlet valve. Swimming was becoming difficult, and now with the second helicopter moving in he found the rotor wash between the two aircraft was making swimming more difficult. Bobbing under the waves, Grissom was scared, angry, and looking for a swimmer from one of the helicopters to help him tread water. Then he caught sight of a familiar face, that of George Cox, aboard the second helicopter. Cox was the copilot who had retrieved both the chimpanzee Ham and Shepard on the first Mercury flight. With his head barely above water, Grissom found the sight of Cox heartening.

Cox tossed the &quot;horse-collar&quot; lifeline straight to Grissom, who immediately wrapped himself into the sling backwards. Lack of orthodoxy mattered little to Grissom now, for he was on his way to the safety of the helicopter, even though swells dunked him twice more before he got aboard. His first thought was to get a life preserver on. Grissom had been either swimming or floating for a period of only four or five minutes, &quot;although it seemed like an eternity to me,&quot; as he said afterward.

As the first helicopter moved away from Grissom, it struggled to raise the spacecraft high enough to drain the water from the impact bag. At one point the spacecraft was almost clear of the water, but like an anchor it prevented the helicopter from moving forward. The flooded capsule weighed over , beyond the helicopter&#x27;s lifting capacity. The pilot, watching his insistent red warning light, decided not to chance losing two craft in one day. He finally cast loose, allowing the spacecraft to sink swiftly. Martin Byrnes, aboard the carrier, suggested that a marker be placed at the point so that the spacecraft might be recovered later. Rear Admiral J. E. Clark advised Byrnes that in that area the depth was about .

====Aftermath====
Substantial controversy ensued, as Grissom reported that the hatch had blown prematurely without his authorization. An independent technical review of the incident between August and October 1961 raised doubts regarding the theory that Grissom had blown the hatch and was responsible for the loss of the spacecraft. There is strong evidence that the Astronaut Office did not accept Grissom&#x27;s guilt in the fact that he was maintained in the prime rotation spot for future flights, commanding the first Gemini flight, and the first planned Apollo flight.

Three Mercury flights later, Astronaut Wally Schirra manually blew &quot;Sigma 7&quot;″s hatch after recovery when his spacecraft was on the deck of the recovery ship, in a deliberate attempt to dispel the rumor that Grissom might have blown the capsule&#x27;s hatch deliberately. As anticipated, the kickback from the manual trigger left Schirra with a visible injury to his right hand. Grissom was uninjured when he exited the spacecraft, as documented by his postflight physical. This strongly supports his assertion that he did not accidentally hit the trigger, since in that case he would have been even more likely to injure himself.

In a 1965 interview, Grissom said that he believed the external release lanyard came loose, triggering the hatch release. On the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;, this release lanyard was held in place by only one screw. This theory was accepted by Guenter Wendt, the Pad Leader for most early American crewed spaceflights.

During a launch simulation on Apollo 1 in 1967, the combination of a cabin fire and an inward-opening hatch contributed to the death of Grissom, as well as that of the astronauts Ed White and Roger B. Chaffee in a launch-pad fire. Use of an explosive hatch had been rejected following the discovery by engineers that, in fact, an explosive egress system on a spacecraft could inadvertently fire without being triggered. Following the Apollo fire, Block II Apollo spacecraft were equipped with rapid-opening systems.

In 2021, analysis of video of the recovery suggested that static electricity may have caused the premature detonation of the hatch bolts. Helicopters are known to build up a charge of static electricity due to the rotors moving through the air. Marine Corps Lt. John Reinhard, the crewman aboard the helicopter who used a set of shears containing explosive charges to snip off the antenna on the floating spacecraft (to allow the helicopter to go lower) reported that &quot;when I touched the antenna there was an arc, and both cutters fired. At the same time, the hatch came off. It could be that some static charge set [the hatch] off.&quot;

==Recovery of &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;==
After several unsuccessful attempts in 1992 and 1993, Oceaneering International, Inc. lifted the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; off the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and onto the deck of a recovery ship on July 20, 1999, the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing and a day shy of the 38th anniversary of the loss of the Mercury capsule. The team was led by Curt Newport and financed by the Discovery Channel.
The spacecraft was found after a 14-year effort by Newport at a depth of nearly , east-southeast of Cape Canaveral. Among the items found within were part of the flight gear and several Mercury dimes which had been taken to space to be souvenirs of the flight.

After &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; was secured on the deck of the recovery ship, the &quot;Ocean Project&quot;, experts removed and disposed of an explosive device (SOFAR bomb) that was supposed to detonate in the event of the spacecraft&#x27;s sinking, but which failed to explode. The spacecraft was then placed in a container filled with seawater to prevent further corrosion. The Cosmosphere, in Hutchinson, Kansas, disassembled and cleaned the spacecraft, and it was released for a national tour through September 15, 2006. The spacecraft was then returned to the Cosmosphere where it is on permanent display. In 2016, it was temporarily lent to The Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis.

==Dramatization in film==
Philip Kaufman&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; includes a dramatization of the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; mission in which Fred Ward played Gus Grissom.
Additional fictional representations also occur in HBO&#x27;s 1998 &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; with Mark Rolston as Gus Grissom and 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; movie with Devin McGee as Gus Grissom.

<text>William James&quot;Willem&quot;Dafoe ( ; born July 22, 1955) is an American actor. Known for his prolific career portraying diverse roles in both mainstream and arthouse films, he is the recipient of various accolades, including nominations for four Academy Awards, a British Academy Film Award, and four Golden Globe Awards. He received an Honorary Golden Bear in 2018.

Dafoe made his film debut with an uncredited role in &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980). He is known for collaborating with auteur filmmakers like Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, Wes Anderson, and Robert Eggers. He received Academy Award nominations for playing a compassionate army Sergeant in the war drama &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), Max Schreck in the mystery film &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; (2000), a kindly motel manager in the coming of age film &quot;The Florida Project&quot; (2017), and Vincent van Gogh in the biopic &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot; (2018).

His other films credits include &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; (1985), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1997), &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000), &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), &quot;Antichrist&quot; (2009), &quot;John Carter&quot; (2012), &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (2019), &quot;Poor Things&quot; (2023), and &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (2024).

Dafoe was a founding member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He portrayed Norman Osborn in the superhero film trilogy &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002–2007), and reprised the role in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). He has also voiced roles in the animated films &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==

William James Dafoe was born on July 22, 1955, in Appleton, Wisconsin, to Muriel Isabel (née Sprissler; 1922–2012) and Dr. William Alfred Dafoe (1917–2014). He recalled in 2009, &quot;My five sisters raised me because my father was a surgeon, my mother was a nurse and they worked together, so I didn&#x27;t see either of them much.&quot; His brother, Donald, is a surgeon and research scientist. His surname, Dafoe, is the English version of the Swiss-French surname Thévou. Half of his family pronounced &quot;Dafoe&quot; as , while half pronounced it ; he did go with the former as a young actor, but ultimately settled with the latter. In high school, he acquired the nickname Willem, the Dutch version of the name William. He later grew more accustomed to it than his birth name.

After attending Appleton East High School, Dafoe studied drama at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and left after 18 months to join the experimental theater company Theatre X in Milwaukee, before moving to New York City in 1976. He apprenticed under Richard Schechner, the director of the avant-garde theater troupe The Performance Group, where he met and became romantically involved with director Elizabeth LeCompte. Following tensions between Schechner and other members after they started staging their own productions outside of the group, Schechner left and the remaining members (including LeCompte and her ex-boyfriend Spalding Gray) renamed themselves The Wooster Group. Dafoe joined the new company and is credited as one of its co-founders. He continued his work with the group into the 2000s, well after establishing himself as a mainstream film star.

== Career ==
=== 1980–1985: Early roles ===
Dafoe made his film debut in a supporting role in Michael Cimino&#x27;s 1980 epic Western film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Dafoe was present for the first three months of an eight-month shoot. His role, that of a cockfighter who works for Jeff Bridges&#x27; character, was removed from a majority of the film during editing but was visible during a cockfight scene. Dafoe did not receive a credit for his work on the film. In 1982, Dafoe starred as the leader of an outlaw motorcycle club in the drama &quot;The Loveless&quot;, his first role as a leading man. The film was co-directed by Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery and paid homage to 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, starring Marlon Brando in a similar role.

Following a brief bit part in &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983), Dafoe again played the leader of a biker gang in Walter Hill&#x27;s 1984 action film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. His character in the film served as the main antagonist, who captures the ex-girlfriend of a mercenary, played by Diane Lane and Michael Paré, respectively. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt there were no great performances in the film, but praised Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;perfectly villainous&quot; face. Dafoe starred alongside Judge Reinhold in &quot;Roadhouse 66&quot; (1985) as a pair of yuppies who become stranded in a town on U.S. Route 66. Later in 1985, Dafoe starred with William Petersen and John Pankow in William Friedkin&#x27;s thriller &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;, in which Dafoe portrays a counterfeiter named Rick Masters who is being tracked by two Secret Service agents. Film critic Roger Ebert commended his &quot;strong&quot; performance in the film.

=== 1986–1996: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

Dafoe&#x27;s sole film release of 1986 was Oliver Stone&#x27;s Vietnam War film &quot;Platoon&quot;, gaining him his widest exposure up to that point for playing the compassionate Sergeant Elias Grodin. He enjoyed the opportunity to play a heroic role and said the film gave him a chance to display his versatility, saying &quot;I think all characters live in you. You just frame them, give them circumstances, and that character will happen.&quot; Principal photography for the film took place in the Philippines and required Dafoe to undergo boot camp training. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Sheila Benson praised his performance and found it to be &quot;particularly fine&quot; to see Dafoe play &quot;something other than a psychopath&quot;. At the 59th Academy Awards, Dafoe was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Dafoe provided his voice to the documentary &quot;Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam&quot; (1987) and, in 1988, Dafoe starred in another film set during the Vietnam War, this time as Buck McGriff in the action thriller &quot;Off Limits&quot;. His second release of 1988 was Martin Scorsese&#x27;s epic drama &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, in which Dafoe portrayed Jesus. The film was adapted from the novel of the same name and depicts his struggle with various forms of temptation throughout his life. Like the novel, the film sparked controversy for departing from the biblical portrayal of Jesus and was branded as being blasphemous. Dafoe&#x27;s performance in the film was widely praised, however, with Janet Maslin opining that Dafoe brought a &quot;gleaming intensity&quot; to the role.

In his final release of 1988, Dafoe starred opposite Gene Hackman in the crime thriller &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; as a pair of FBI agents investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi during the civil rights movement. &quot;Variety&quot; praised Dafoe&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;Dafoe gives a disciplined and noteworthy portrayal of Ward&quot;, although they felt it was Hackman &quot;who steals the picture&quot;. As with &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, the film was the subject of controversy, this time among African-American activists who criticized its fictionalization of events. Dafoe was briefly considered for the role of the super-villain the Joker in the Tim Burton-directed superhero film &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), as screenwriter Sam Hamm noticed physical similarities, but was never offered the part that eventually went to Jack Nicholson. Dafoe starred in the drama &quot;Triumph of the Spirit&quot; in 1989 as Jewish Greek boxer Salamo Arouch, an Auschwitz concentration camp inmate who was forced to fight other internees to death for the Nazi officers&#x27; entertainment. It was filmed on location at Auschwitz, the first major film to do so. While the film was negatively received, Dafoe&#x27;s performance was lauded by some critics; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt he gave a &quot;disciplined performance&quot; and Janet Maslin thought he was &quot;harrowingly good&quot;. Dafoe reunited with &quot;Platoon&quot; director Oliver Stone for a small appearance in the biographical war drama &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989). Dafoe played a paraplegic, wheelchair-using Vietnam veteran who befriends the film&#x27;s subject Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise), another paraplegic veteran.

Dafoe made a cameo appearance in John Waters&#x27; musical comedy &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990) as a prison guard who gives a brief lecture on values to the title character, who is played by Johnny Depp. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the scene to be one of the film&#x27;s highlights. In the same year, Dafoe co-starred in David Lynch&#x27;s crime film &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; with Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Dafoe played a criminal who engages in a robbery with Cage&#x27;s character before demonstrating his dark side. He wore fake, corroded teeth and grew a pencil moustache that bore resemblance to his previous collaborator, John Waters. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Owen Gleiberman felt the role proved Dafoe as a &quot;master of leering, fish-faced villainy&quot;. In 1991, Dafoe starred with Danny Glover and Brad Johnson in the action film &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;. The film follows a pair of pilots, played by Dafoe and Johnson, who scheme and participate in an unauthorized air strike on Hanoi. Directed by John Millius, the film received negative reviews. He was due to star opposite Joan Cusack in the comedy &quot;Arrive Alive&quot; in 1991, but the film was canceled during production. Dafoe had two lead roles in 1992. The first to be released, &quot;White Sands&quot;, saw Dafoe a play small-town sheriff who impersonates a dead man after finding his dead body and a suitcase containing $500,000 to solve the case, resulting in an investigation. In his next starring role, Paul Schrader&#x27;s drama &quot;Light Sleeper&quot;, Dafoe played John LeTour, a lonely, insomniac, New Yorker working as a delivery man for a drug supplier, who is played by Susan Sarandon. Roger Ebert praised Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;gifted&quot; portrayal of LeTour and Owen Gleiberman opined that &quot;even when the film doesn&#x27;t gel, one is held by Willem Dafoe&#x27;s grimly compelling performance.&quot;

Dafoe next starred in the erotic thriller &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; (1993) with Madonna. The story concerns a lawyer, played by Dafoe, who engages in a sexual relationship with the woman he is representing in a murder case. The film was panned by critics and performed poorly at the box office, with some audience members laughing during the sex scenes. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby felt that Dafoe lacked sensuality in the role. Later in 1993, Dafoe appeared in a supporting role as Emit Flesti in the German fantasy film &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot;, directed by Wim Wenders. Dafoe co-starred in the spy thriller &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994), an adaptation of the Tom Clancy novel of the name starring Harrison Ford as operative Jack Ryan. Dafoe played John Clark, a CIA agent conducting a covert operation against a drug cartel in Colombia with Jack Ryan. Dafoe portrayed the poet T. S. Eliot in the drama &quot;Tom &amp; Viv&quot; (also in 1994), which tells the story of Eliot and his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, who was played by Miranda Richardson. The film was met with a mixed reception from critics, although Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;stunningly sharp, sympathetic portrait raises the film above a script that is full of serious holes and stilted dialogue&quot;. In 1995, he played an 18th-century writer in the period drama &quot;The Night and the Moment&quot;.

In his first of three film appearances in 1996, Dafoe made a cameo appearance as an electrician in the biographical drama &quot;Basquiat&quot;. Next, he played an operative in the romantic war drama &quot;The English Patient&quot;. &quot;The English Patient&quot; was filmed in Tuscany, where Dafoe said he particularly enjoyed the &quot;quiet moments in the monastery between shoots&quot;. In the period drama &quot;Victory&quot;—which was filmed in 1994 and premiered in Europe in 1996, but was not released until 1998—Dafoe played a European living on an island in the Southeast Asia who becomes the target of redemption after preventing a woman, played by Irène Jacob, from being raped.

=== 1997–2013: Established actor ===
In 1997, Dafoe returned to playing a villainous role in the action thriller &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, expressing the necessity of appearing in both independent and blockbuster films. The film starred Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric as a couple vacationing on a luxury cruise that has been hijacked by Dafoe&#x27;s character, Geiger, a hacker that has programmed the ship to crash into an oil tanker. &quot;Speed 2&quot; was met with negative reviews from critics, with Dafoe himself receiving a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor. For his next film, &quot;Affliction&quot; (1997), Dafoe worked with Paul Schrader for a second time, playing the brother of Nick Nolte&#x27;s character and served as the film&#x27;s narrator. Also in 1997, Dafoe took on a voice acting role in an episode of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;The Secret War of Lisa Simpson&quot;, voicing the commandant of a military academy that Bart and Lisa Simpson are attending. Following a villainous supporting role in the romantic mystery drama &quot;Lulu on the Bridge&quot;, Dafoe starred alongside Christopher Walken and Asia Argento in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s cyberpunk drama &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; in 1998. It follows X (Dafoe) and Fox (Walken), a pair of corporate raiders attempting to lure a Japanese scientist from one megacorporation to another. Although the film was largely dismissed by critics, critic David Stratton found there to be &quot;compensation&quot; in the performances.

In 1999, Dafoe gave a supporting performance in David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Existenz&quot;, a science fiction thriller in which he played a gas station owner named Gas. Later in the year, Dafoe starred in the action film &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;. He played an eccentric, gay FBI agent assigned with investigating a series of murders committed by the MacManus twins (played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) who are acting as vigilantes after an act of self-defense. &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; was negatively received by film critics, largely for its extreme violence and lack of emotional depth, though some critics praised Dafoe&#x27;s role in the film. The film performed poorly at the box office, but has since been branded as being a cult film.

In his first film of the 2000s, Dafoe was featured in a supporting role in &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000) as a private investigator investigating the disappearance of a co-worker of Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), an investment banker who leads a double life as a serial killer. He then acted in Steve Buscemi&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Animal Factory&quot;, starring as an incarcerated veteran con-man who takes a young inmate (played by Edward Furlong) under his wing and introduces to him to his gang. The film was positively received by critics and Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Dafoe steals the picture with his comic timing&quot;.
That same year he starred in &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot;, his final film of the year. He portrayed a fictionalized version of the German actor Max Schreck during the production of the 1922 horror film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, in which Schreck starred as the vampire Count Orlok. Dafoe&#x27;s co-star John Malkovich portrayed the film&#x27;s director, F. W. Murnau. The film delves into fiction when, over the course of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;″s production, the cast and crew come to discover that Schreck is actually a vampire himself. Much of the film&#x27;s critical praise went to Dafoe; Roger Ebert wrote that Dafoe &quot;embodies the Schreck of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; so uncannily that when real scenes from the silent classic are slipped into the frame, we don&#x27;t notice a difference&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt the film&#x27;s &quot;only redeeming quality&quot; was Dafoe&#x27;s &quot;enjoyably over-the-top, eye-rolling performance&quot;. Dafoe received numerous awards and nominations for his performance, including his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination. Dafoe took on two leading roles in 2001, both of which were as priests. In the drama &quot;Pavilion of Women&quot;, he played an American priest living in China who falls in love with a local married woman (played by the film&#x27;s screenwriter Luo Yan) while giving her son a Western education. He starred opposite Haley Joel Osment in &quot;Edges of the Lord&quot;, playing a compassionate priest helping a young Jewish boy pose as a Catholic to protect him during Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Poland.

Dafoe played the supervillain the Green Goblin in Sam Raimi&#x27;s 2002 superhero film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, starring Tobey Maguire as the titular Marvel Comics superhero. Dafoe played the Norman Osborn incarnation of the Green Goblin, the billionaire founder and owner of the corporation Oscorp, becoming the Green Goblin after testing an unstable strength enhancer on himself, turning him insane and making him extremely powerful. Osborn is a family friend of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity Peter Parker as Osborn&#x27;s son, Harry Osborn (played by James Franco), is a close friend of Parker. The role required Dafoe to wear an uncomfortable costume and mask that made it impossible to emote using his face, confining Dafoe to convey emotion through his voice and head movements. Dafoe also had to wear a prosthetic teeth for his part as Norman whereas the hallucinations of the character had Dafoe in his natural teeth. Dafoe&#x27;s role in the film was generally well-received, including a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reviewer who felt he put &quot;the scare in archvillain&quot; and Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; who deemed him &quot;strong support&quot;. Conversely, critic A. O. Scott wrote that his performance was &quot;uninspired and secondhand&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; Richard George commented that Green Goblin&#x27;s armor, particularly the helmet, was &quot;almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression&quot;. Steven Scaife at &quot;Vice&quot; wrote that Dafoe&#x27;s Goblin &quot;represents everything that&#x27;s fun about superhero villains, as well as everything that&#x27;s great about Raimi&#x27;s campy films&quot;, also commending Dafoe&#x27;s voice and body language, which helped overcome the bulky Green Goblin costume that he compared to that of a &quot;Power Rangers&quot; villain.

Later in 2002, Dafoe starred with Greg Kinnear in Paul Schrader&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Auto Focus&quot;, Dafoe&#x27;s third collaboration with Schrader. Dafoe portrayed John Henry Carpenter, an electronics expert who develops a strange friendship with the actor Bob Crane, leading Crane into a downward spiral. Dafoe provided his voice to the animated Pixar film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in 2003. Dafoe voiced Gill, a moorish idol fish who helps Nemo, a clownfish, in his struggle to return home to the ocean. In the same year, Dafoe appeared in a small but pivotal role as a drug lord planning a coup d&#x27;état against the President of Mexico in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s action film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;. He acted in the murder mystery film &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (2004), in which he starred with Paul Bettany. The film takes place during the Middle Ages and saw Dafoe play the leader of acting troupe that recreate the events surrounding a woman accused of witchcraft and murder, who they believe is innocent. Dafoe lent his voice and likeness to the James Bond video game &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot; (2004) as the villain Nikolai Diavolo.
The following year, Dafoe took on another villainous role in &quot;The Clearing&quot;, albeit with a more sympathetic approach. Dafoe co-starred as a man who kidnaps his former boss (played by Robert Redford) in exchange for a ransom. The film received mixed reviews, although Peter Travers felt that he added a note of &quot;vulnerability to the menace he has made his stock in trade&quot;. Dafoe reprised his role as Norman Osborn in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004), appearing to his son Harry in an hallucination. The cameo was suggested by Dafoe, comparing it to the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father visiting his son to ask him to avenge his death. Dafoe was next seen in the comedy-drama &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), his first of three films with director Wes Anderson. He played the &quot;hilariously doltish&quot; German first mate of a research vessel owned by the eponymous lead character, who is played by Bill Murray.

Dafoe had a small role as a tabloid magazine editor in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), a biographical film about Howard Hughes starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Also in 2004, Dafoe narrated the documentary &quot;Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, chronicling the production of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and co-starred in the direct-to-video thriller &quot;Control&quot; (2004) alongside Ray Liotta and Michelle Rodriguez. Dafoe co-starred in &quot;&quot; (2005), an action film sequel starring Ice Cube in which Dafoe played a U.S. Secretary of Defense attempting a coup d&#x27;état against the President of the United States. It was largely panned by critics, although Dafoe stated he did not regret appearing in the film.

With the avant-garde drama &quot;Manderlay&quot; in 2005, Dafoe began another actor-director collaboration, this time with Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier. Dafoe co-starred in the film as the father of Bryce Dallas Howard&#x27;s character, a woman who discovers a plantation still thriving as if slavery had never been abolished. Along with his wife Giada Colagrande, Dafoe co-wrote and starred in &quot;Before It Had a Name&quot; (2005), which Colagrande directed. Dafoe played the caretaker of a house that is inherited by the lover of its deceased owner, engaging in a sexual relationship with her. The film was excoriated by a &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer as a &quot;wannabe haunted house tale laced with silly sex scenes&quot; and an &quot;embarrassment&quot;. His fourth and final film appearance of 2005 was the crime thriller &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot;, in which he played a museum curator. Dafoe had a supporting role in Spike Lee&#x27;s 2006 crime thriller &quot;Inside Man&quot;, playing a veteran captain helping with a hostage negotiation during a bank heist on Wall Street. Dafoe co-starred as the White House Chief of Staff in &quot;American Dreamz&quot;, a comedy satirizing both popular entertainment and American politics. His character was described as a &quot;diminutive version of Dick Cheney, with wire-rimmed glasses and a fringe of white hair&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot; writer Caryn James. He starred with Juliette Binoche in a short film directed by Nobuhiro Suwa as part of the 2006 anthology film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot;.
In 2007, Dafoe played a pretentious film director in the British comedy film &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; thought that Dafoe appeared to think he was &quot;in a pantomime&quot;, while a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer felt he was &quot;amusing&quot; in the role. Dafoe starred as the owner of a strip club in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;Go Go Tales&quot; (2007); Manohla Dargis praised his &quot;twitchy, sympathetic performance&quot; in the film. In the same year, Dafoe voiced the main villain, an evil wizard, in the English dub of the Japanese animated fantasy film &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot;, had a supporting role as a US Senator in the drama &quot;The Walker&quot;, his fourth collaboration with Paul Schrader, and took on the lead role in the psychological thriller &quot;Anamorph&quot;, in which Dafoe played a detective who notices the case he is investigating bears similarities to a previous case of his. He reprised his role again as Norman Osborn in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007) in a brief cameo. Dafoe starred with Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts, and Emily Watson in the drama &quot;Fireflies in the Garden&quot;, which premiered at Berlinale in 2008 but was not released theatrically until 2011. Dafoe played a cold, domineering English professor who has a strained relationship with his family. The film received mostly negative reviews, although the performances were generally praised. Roger Ebert thought that Dafoe was &quot;fearsome&quot; in the role, while Manohla Dargis felt he and Roberts were &quot;awkwardly matched&quot; as a married couple. Dafoe co-starred as a Nazi officer in Paul Schrader&#x27;s &quot;Adam Resurrected&quot; (2008), which starred Jeff Goldblum as a concentration camp internee. In his final release of 2008, Dafoe starred in the Greek drama &quot;The Dust of Time&quot; as an American film director of Greek descent making a film his mother&#x27;s (played by Irène Jacob) life. The critic Peter Brunette felt the cast&#x27;s performances, especially Dafoe&#x27;s, were unconvincing.

Dafoe appeared in seven films in 2009, the first of which was in Lars von Trier&#x27;s experimental film &quot;Antichrist&quot;. Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg played a couple whose relationship becomes increasingly sexually violent and sadomasochistic after retreating to a cabin in the woods following the death of their child. The film received a polarized response from critics and audiences, receiving both applause and boos at the Cannes Film Festival and was called the &quot;most shocking movie&quot; to be shown at the festival because of its graphic sex scenes. Roger Ebert commended Dafoe&#x27;s and Gainsbourg&#x27;s performances as being &quot;heroic and fearless&quot;. During an interview with L Magazine, it was revealed Dafoe had a stand in for scenes where his character&#x27;s penis was on screen as his own was too big. Dafoe next had a small role in the French thriller &quot;Farewell&quot; as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and co-starred opposite Michael Shannon in Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?&quot;, in which he played a detective attempting to figure out why a troubled man killed his own mother. Dafoe played a former vampire who has a cure that can save the human species in the science fiction horror film &quot;Daybreakers&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that Dafoe &quot;triumphs over some awful dialogue by giving the role his nutsy-greatsy weirdness&quot;. Dafoe had a voice role in Wes Anderson&#x27;s stop-motion animated film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; starring George Clooney as the titular Roald Dahl character. &quot;Fresh Air&quot; critic David Edelstein felt Dafoe was one of the film&#x27;s highlights as a &quot;hep-cat, knife-wielding rat security guard&quot;. Dafoe reprised his role from &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; in &quot;The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day&quot;, making a brief cameo appearance. His final appearance of the year was in &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot;, another film centring around vampires in which Dafoe played the foppish vampire Gavner Purl. Between October and December 2009, Dafoe appeared in Richard Foreman&#x27;s surrealist play &quot;Idiot Savant&quot; at The Public Theater.

Dafoe appeared in two films that premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in 2010, making a brief appearance in Julian Schnabel&#x27;s political thriller &quot;Miral&quot;, which some reviewers found to be distracting. and starred in his wife Giada Colagrande&#x27;s film &quot;A Woman&quot;. Also in 2010, Dafoe began voicing Clarence, the Birds Eye polar bear mascot in the company&#x27;s television commercials in the United Kingdom, and narrated &quot;Into the Deep: America, Whaling &amp; the World&quot;, a Ric Burns documentary about the history of the whaling industry in the United States.

Dafoe&#x27;s first of two leading roles in 2011 was in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s apocalyptic drama &quot;4:44 Last Day on Earth&quot;, his third film with Ferrara. He played an actor spending his last hours on Earth before the end of the world with his much-younger lover (played by Shanyn Leigh). The film garnered a poor reaction critics, with a reviewer for &quot;Paste&quot; stating &quot;there&#x27;s only so much depth [Dafoe] can bring to such a shallow character&quot;. Dafoe starred in the Australian drama &quot;The Hunter&quot;, playing a professional hunter who travels to Tasmania to hunt down the world&#x27;s only remaining thylacine. Critic Stephen Holden wrote in his review of the film, &quot;Even in the &quot;toughest, most macho roles... [Dafoe] retains a tinge of Christ-like sweetness and vulnerability&quot;. In 2011, Dafoe began narrating a series of television commercials for the company Fage and starred in a Jim Beam commercial titled &quot;Bold Choices&quot;. Dafoe starred alongside Marina Abramović and Gretchen Mol in the play &quot;The Life and Death of Marina Abramović&quot;, where he played six different roles including Abramović&#x27;s father Vojin, Abramović&#x27;s brother Velimir and Abramović&#x27;s partner Ulay, and which premiered at The Lowry in 2011.

Dafoe played Martian chieftain Tars Tarkas in the Disney film &quot;John Carter&quot; (2012), using motion capture to portray the multi-limbed character. The film was a box office failure and ranks among the biggest box-office bombs of all time. Later in 2012, Dafoe co-starred in the low-budget crime thriller &quot;Tomorrow You&#x27;re Gone&quot; with Stephen Dorff and Michelle Monaghan. In 2013, Dafoe played a police officer in the supernatural thriller &quot;Odd Thomas&quot;, starring Anton Yelchin as the titular character that possesses supernatural powers to see the dead. Using motion-capture acting technology, Dafoe co-starred alongside Elliot Page in David Cage&#x27;s video game &quot;&quot; (2013) as a paranormal activity researcher who acts as the surrogate-father-figure to a girl who possesses supernatural powers. The game polarized reviewers, although Dafoe and Page&#x27;s performance were widely praised. In Scott Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot; (2013), starring Christian Bale, Dafoe played the supporting role of a bookmaker running an illegal gambling operation. Dafoe next appeared in Lars von Trier&#x27;s two-part erotic art film &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;, his third and final film release of 2013. In the film, Dafoe played a perverse businessman who hires Charlotte Gainsbourg&#x27;s character to work as a debt collector using sex and sadomasochism. Also in 2013, Dafoe played the devil in a Mercedes-Benz Super Bowl commercial and starred in three short student films as part of a competition sponsored by Jameson Irish Whiskey.

=== 2014–present: Independent films ===

In 2014, Dafoe portrayed a wealthy private banker with connections to the Russia mafia opposite Philip Seymour Hoffman in Anton Corbijn&#x27;s espionage thriller &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot;.

Dafoe next starred alongside Matt Dillon as a detective in the crime thriller &quot;Bad Country&quot;, which critic Justin Chang dismissed as being &quot;blandly constructed&quot;.

In May 2014, Dafoe served as member of the main competition jury at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. He was next featured in a supporting role as a mean-spirited, alcoholic author who is visited by a pair of cancer patients, who are played by Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, in the romantic drama &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot;. Dafoe once again collaborated with Ferrara on the drama &quot;Pasolini&quot;, in which he played Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini during his last days before his murder in 1975. Film critic Peter Bradshaw noted the physical similarities between Dafoe and Pasolini, although felt Dafoe had too little screen time in the film. His final film of 2014 was the action thriller &quot;John Wick&quot; starring Keanu Reeves, in which Dafoe appeared as the mentor to the titular character, a former hitman who is forced out of retirement to seek vengeance for the killing of his puppy. Dafoe stated he found the use of gun fu combat created an interesting mix of action, stating &quot;you have the grace of martial arts, but then the bang of the gun&quot;. His performance in the film was generally well received by critics, including Peter Travers who felt he provided &quot;ample compensation&quot;. Dafoe made his second guest appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in November 2014, voicing a new school teacher who bullies Bart Simpson profusely. Dafoe starred in director&#x27;s Héctor Babenco&#x27;s final film &quot;My Hindu Friend&quot; (2015) as a film director close to death who befriends a Hindu 8-year-old boy while hospitalized.

The black comedy &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (2016), Dafoe&#x27;s sixth film with Paul Schrader, starred Dafoe and Nicolas Cage as a pair of ex-convicts hired to kidnap a baby. In the same year, Dafoe reprised his voice role as Gill, a Moorish idol fish, from &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in its sequel &quot;Finding Dory&quot;. He next played the boss of Gerard Butler&#x27;s character in the drama &quot;A Family Man&quot; and starred in Loris Gréaud&#x27;s arthouse science fiction film &quot;Sculpt&quot;, which was only screened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for one person at a time. His final film of the year was the monster film &quot;The Great Wall&quot;, a Chinese-American co-production directed by Zhang Yimou starring Matt Damon as an Irish mercenary in China defending the Great Wall of China from a horde of monsters, in which Dafoe played a former adventurer working as a teacher in China. Also in 2016, Dafoe appeared in another Super Bowl commercial, this time for Snickers, recreating Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s iconic white dress scene from the film &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;.
In 2017, Dafoe co-starred in Sean Baker&#x27;s drama &quot;The Florida Project&quot; as the manager of a motel who houses a toxic mother and her six-year-old daughter. The film and his performance received critical acclaim, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Ann Hornaday writing that &quot;Dafoe delivers his finest performance in recent memory, bringing to levelheaded, unsanctimonious life a character who offers a glimmer of hope and caring within a world markedly short on both&quot;. Dafoe earned his third Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination, as well as nominations at the Golden Globes, SAG Awards, and BAFTA Awards. In 2017, Dafoe also played and voiced the character of Ryuk, a demonic death god from Japanese mythology, in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Death Note&quot;, and adaptation of the Japanese supernatural-thriller manga of the same name. He narrated Australian documentarian Jennifer Peedom&#x27;s documentary &quot;Mountain&quot;. Also that year, he co-starred as Gerhard Hardman in a film adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s detective novel &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh; and played Atlantean scientist Nuidis Vulko in a deleted role in Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot;. He later played Nuidis Vulko in a leading role in James Wan&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Aquaman&quot;. The same year, Dafoe played Vincent van Gogh in the biographical drama &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot;, for which he received the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. His performance drew raves from film critics. Peter Keough of &quot;Boston Globe&quot; said Dafoe &quot;may be the best actor around for expressing an inner life in extremis.&quot;

In 2019, he had a supporting role in Edward Norton&#x27;s period crime drama &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; where he played powerful developer Moses Randolph&#x27;s &quot;beaten and broken&quot; brother. In the same year, he played a lighthouse keeper on a storm-swept island in Robert Eggers&#x27; psychological horror &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; opposite Robert Pattinson. It had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, where the film and Dafoe&#x27;s performance received high praise. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Both actors are sensational (and they work together like one), but in terms of sheer showboating power it&#x27;s Dafoe&#x27;s movie.&quot; Dafoe portrayed sled dog breeder, trainer, and musher Leonhard Seppala in &quot;Togo&quot;. Dafoe acted in Wes Anderson&#x27;s ensemble period comedy &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; and Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, which were both released in 2021, and Robert Eggers&#x27;s historical epic &quot;The Northman&quot;, released in 2022. All projects pushed their release dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dafoe voiced the Australian ABC-television documentary &quot;River&quot; in 2021, which was written to highlight the precaricity of rivers worldwide. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked him No. 18 in its list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century.
Dafoe reprised his role as Green Goblin from Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). To avoid having his role in the film prematurely revealed, Dafoe wore a cloak on-set to conceal his appearance from being outed publicly. The star of the film, Tom Holland, said that he got scared after bumping into Dafoe by accident one day on set and only then found out about his role in the film. Also, like Alfred Molina (who reprised his role as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus in the film), Dafoe was digitally de-aged for the character&#x27;s 2002 self. Upon release of &quot;No Way Home&quot;, Dafoe&#x27;s reprisal was met with universal acclaim. &quot;The Lantern&quot; Brett Price wrote that Dafoe was &quot;on another level&quot; in &quot;No Way Home&quot; and not having his mask made him even more intimidating than he was in the 2002 film. Peter Travers of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and Jade King at &quot;The Gamer&quot; praised Dafoe and Molina, with King asserting that the two &quot;stole the show as Green Goblin and Doc Ock&quot; and described the depictions as brilliant. Amelia Emberwing of &quot;IGN&quot; praised Dafoe, Molina, and Foxx in &quot;No Way Home&quot;, while &quot;Vulture&quot; Bilge Ebiri said Dafoe &quot;once again gets to have some modest fun with his character&#x27;s divided self&quot;.

On January 18, 2022, it was announced that Dafoe would host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on January 29, 2022, with musical guest singer Katy Perry.

Dafoe met Italian actress Giada Colagrande on the set of Wes Anderson&#x27;s film, &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. They were married on March 25, 2005. Dafoe recalled in 2010, &quot;We were having lunch and I said, &#x27;Do you want to get married tomorrow?&#x27;&quot; They did so the following afternoon at a small ceremony with two friends as witnesses. They have since worked together on her films &quot;Before It Had a Name&quot; and &quot;A Woman&quot;. They split their time between Rome, Los Angeles, and New York City. Dafoe acquired Italian citizenship through the marriage.

Dafoe is a pescetarian, and believes that &quot;animal farms are one of the main causes of the destruction of the planet&quot;. He signed a letter calling to act strongly against the threats of climate change and biodiversity loss. He practices ashtanga vinyasa yoga every day.

On May 22, 2022, Dafoe was invited back to his &quot;alma mater&quot; the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee by Chancellor Mark Mone to serve as the keynote speaker for the university&#x27;s commencement ceremony and to receive an honorary Doctor of Arts degree.

After the successful completion of the Mercury-Atlas 5 flight that carried Enos, a chimpanzee, in late November 1961, a press conference was held in early December. Reporters asked NASA&#x27;s Robert Gilruth who would be the first U.S. astronaut in orbit, piloting MA-6. He then announced the team members for the next two Mercury missions. John H. Glenn was selected as prime pilot for the first mission (MA-6), with M. Scott Carpenter as his backup. Donald K. Slayton and Walter M. Schirra were pilot and backup, respectively, for the second mission, Mercury-Atlas 7.

The MA-6 launch vehicle, Atlas #109-D, arrived at Cape Canaveral the evening of November 30, 1961. NASA had wanted to launch MA-6 in 1961 (hoping to orbit an astronaut in the same calendar year as the Soviets did), but by early December it was apparent that the mission hardware would not be ready for launch until early 1962.

Mercury spacecraft #13 began taking form on McDonnell&#x27;s St. Louis, Missouri assembly line in May 1960. It was chosen for the MA-6 mission in October 1960 and delivered to Cape Canaveral on August 27, 1961. Mercury spacecraft #13 and Atlas #109-D were stacked on the pad at Launch Complex 14 on January 2, 1962.

As the effects of orbital space flight on humans were unknown except to the Soviets, who were keeping whatever knowledge they had a secret, Glenn was prepared with an onboard medical kit consisting of morphine for pain relief, mephentermine sulfate to treat any shock symptoms, benzylamine hydrochloride to counter motion sickness and racemic amphetamine sulfate, a stimulant. A survival kit was also placed on board to assist Glenn while waiting for recovery after splashdown, including desalter kits, dye marker, distress signal, signal mirrors, signal whistle, first aid kits, shark chaser, a PK-2 raft, survival rations, matches, and a radio transceiver. In addition, due to the lessons learnt from the previous two manned flights, MA-6 was the first American spaceflight to include a dedicated urine collection device. 

Prior to MA-6, there had been a reluctance on the part of NASA to permit the use of cameras by astronauts as it was feared these might prove an unnecessary distraction. Glenn, however, was successful in persuading NASA that he should be allowed to take one on the mission, and a Minolta Hi-Matic 35mm film camera (which he purchased himself at a local drug store) duly made the trip into orbit. This was modified to be used with pressure suit gloves, although changing the film in a weightless environment proved a difficult operation and during the flight Glenn knocked a film canister which then floated away, ending up behind the instrument panel.

==Naming==
Glenn dubbed his capsule &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, the seven in honor of the seven original astronauts selected for Mercury, a tradition inadvertently started by prior Mercury pilot, Alan Shepard, who incorporated the seven in &quot;Freedom 7&quot; as his spacecraft was factory model no. 7. The other astronauts liked the symbolism, and so each appended 7 to their spacecraft names as well.

The spacecraft&#x27;s name was developed democratically, with Glenn, his wife, Annie, and their children all participating in the process, consulting dictionaries and a thesaurus for possibilities.

&quot;We played around with &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;Independence&quot;, a lot of them. The more I thought about it, the more I leaned toward the name &quot;Friendship&quot;. Flying around the world, over all those countries, that was the message I wanted to convey. In the end, that was the name the kids liked best, too. I was real proud of them.&quot; &quot;John Glenn&quot;

==Flight==

===Delays===
The launch date was first announced as January 16, 1962, then postponed to January 20 because of problems with the Atlas rocket fuel tanks. A faulty yaw gyro was detected by the Spin Motor Rotation Detection System and replaced on January 13. The launch then slipped day by day to January 27 due to unfavorable winter weather. On that day, Glenn was on board Mercury 6 and ready to launch, when, at T−29 minutes, the flight director called off the launch because of thick clouds that would have made it impossible to photograph or film the launch vehicle after the first 20 seconds of the mission (the inability of launch crews to film the failed Mercury-Atlas 1 launch 16 months earlier had proven the importance of flying only in clear skies). The large crowd of reporters gathered at Cape Canaveral for the launch went home, disappointed. Mission Director Walter Williams felt a sense of relief at the bad weather, as there was still a general sense that the spacecraft and booster were not ready to fly yet.

NASA informed the anxious public that the mission would take time to get ready since crewed launches required a high degree of preparation and safety standards. The launch was postponed until February 1, but when technicians began to fuel the Atlas on January 30, they discovered a fuel leak had soaked an internal insulation blanket between the RP-1 and LOX tanks. This caused a two-week delay while necessary repairs were made. On February 14, the launch was again postponed due to weather, which started to break on February 18, and it appeared that February 20 would be a favorable day to attempt a launch.

The Flight Safety Review Board then met a few days before the launch to overview the twelve Atlas flights since Mercury-Atlas 5 last November. Four failures had occurred in this time. Atlas 5F and Ranger 3 had guidance failures that were of no concern for Mercury as it used a different model of guidance system and Atlas 6F and Samos 5 had random quality defects unlikely to be an issue on the more tightly supervised Mercury program.

===Launch===
Glenn boarded the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; spacecraft at 11:03 UTC on February 20 following an hour-and-a-half delay to replace a faulty component in the Atlas&#x27;s guidance system. The hatch was bolted in place at 12:10 UTC. Most of the 70 hatch bolts had been secured, when one was discovered to be broken. This caused a 42-minute delay while all the bolts were removed, the defective bolt was replaced and the hatch was re-bolted in place. The count was resumed at 11:25 UTC, and the gantry was rolled back at 13:20 UTC. At 13:58 UTC the count was held for 25 minutes while a liquid oxygen propellant valve was repaired.

At 14:47 UTC, after two hours and 17 minutes of holds and three hours and 44 minutes after Glenn entered &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, engineer T. J. O&#x27;Malley pressed the button in the blockhouse launching the spacecraft. O&#x27;Malley said, &quot;the good Lord ride all the way,&quot; and then capsule communicator Scott Carpenter uttered the famous phrase &quot;Godspeed, John Glenn.&quot; Due to a glitch in Glenn&#x27;s radio, he did not hear the Carpenter phrase during launch. At liftoff Glenn&#x27;s pulse rate climbed to 110 beats per minute.

Thirty seconds after liftoff, the General Electric-Burroughs designed guidance system locked onto a radio transponder in the booster to guide the vehicle to orbit. As the Atlas and &quot;Friendship 7&quot; passed through max Q Glenn reported, &quot;Have some vibration area coming up here now.&quot; After max Q the flight smoothed out. At two minutes and 14 seconds after launch, the booster engines cut off and dropped away. Then at two minutes and twenty-four seconds, the escape tower was jettisoned, right on schedule.

After the tower was jettisoned, the Atlas and spacecraft pitched over still further, giving Glenn his first view of the horizon. He described the view as &quot;a beautiful sight, looking eastward across the Atlantic&quot;. Vibration increased as the last of the fuel supply was used up. Booster performance had been nearly flawless through the entire powered flight. At sustainer engine cut-off, it was found that the Atlas had accelerated the capsule to a speed only below nominal. At 14:52 UTC, &quot;Friendship 7&quot; was in orbit. Glenn received word that the Atlas had boosted the MA-6 into a trajectory that would stay up for at least seven orbits. Meanwhile, computers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland indicated that the MA-6 orbital parameters appeared good enough for almost 100 orbits.

===First orbit===
When the posigrade rockets fired and separated the capsule from the booster, the five-second rate-damping operation started two and a half seconds late. This caused a substantial roll error as the capsule began its turnaround. The automatic attitude control system took 38 seconds to place &quot;Friendship 7&quot; into its proper orbital attitude. The turnaround maneuver used of fuel from a total supply of : for automatic and for manual control system. The spacecraft then settled into orbital flight with a velocity of .

&quot;Friendship 7&quot; began its first orbit with all systems go. It crossed the Atlantic and passed over the Canary Islands. Controllers there reported all capsule systems in perfect working order. Looking at the African coastline, and later the interior over Kano, Nigeria, Glenn told the tracking station team that he could see a dust storm. Kano flight communicators replied that the winds had been quite heavy for the past week.

Over Kano, Glenn took control of the spacecraft and started a major yaw adjustment. He allowed the spacecraft to continue the yaw maneuver until it was facing into its flight path. Glenn noticed that the attitude indicators disagreed with what he observed was the true spacecraft attitude. Even with the incorrect instrument readouts, he was pleased to be facing forward instead of backward on his orbital path.

Over the Indian Ocean, Glenn observed his first sunset from orbit. He described the moment of twilight as &quot;beautiful&quot;. The sky in space was very black, he said, with a thin band of blue along the horizon. He said the sun set fast, but not as quickly as he had expected. For five or six minutes there was a slow reduction in light intensity. Brilliant orange and blue layers spread out 45 to 60 degrees on either side of the sun, tapering gradually toward the horizon. Clouds prevented him from seeing a mortar flare fired by the Indian Ocean tracking ship as part of a pilot observation experiment.

Continuing his journey on the night side of Earth, nearing the Australian coastline, Glenn made star, weather, and landmark observations. He looked for but failed to see the dim light phenomenon known as the zodiacal light; his eyes had insufficient time to adapt to the darkness.

The spacecraft came into radio range of Muchea, Australia. At the Mercury Tracking Station there, Gordon Cooper was the capsule communicator. Glenn reported that he felt fine and had no problems. He saw a very bright light and what appeared to be the outline of a city. Cooper said that he probably was looking at the lights of Perth and its satellite town of Rockingham. This turned out to be correct; many people in Perth turned on their lights so as to be visible to Glenn as he passed over. &quot;That sure was a short day,&quot; he excitedly told Cooper. &quot;That was about the shortest day I&#x27;ve ever run into.&quot;

The spacecraft moved across Australia and across the Pacific to Canton Island. Glenn experienced a short 45 minute night and prepared the periscope for viewing his first sunrise from orbit. As the sun rose over the island, he saw thousands of &quot;little specks, brilliant specks, floating around outside the capsule&quot;; he momentarily felt that the spacecraft was tumbling or that he was looking into a star field. A quick hard look out of the spacecraft window corrected the illusion and Glenn was sure that the &quot;fireflies&quot;, as he called them, were streaming past his spacecraft from ahead. They seemed to flow by slowly but did not seem to be coming from any part of the spacecraft, and they disappeared as &quot;Friendship 7&quot; moved into brighter sunlight. It was later determined that they were probably small ice crystals venting from onboard spacecraft systems.

&quot;I am in a big mass of some very small particles, they&#x27;re brilliantly lit up like they&#x27;re luminescent. I never saw anything like it. They round a little: they&#x27;re coming by the capsule and they look like little stars. A whole shower of them coming by. They swirl around the capsule and go in front of the window and they&#x27;re all brilliantly lighted.&quot; Glenn started banging the capsule wall and watched the &quot;fireflies&quot; come off, just as Alan Shepard did.

As the spacecraft crossed the Kauai, Hawaii tracking station, Glenn noticed a lot of interference on the HF radio band. As he crossed the Pacific coast of North America, the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico, informed Mercury Control in Florida that a yaw thruster was causing attitude control problems. Glenn later recalled, this problem &quot;was to stick with me for the rest of the flight&quot;.

Glenn noticed the control problem when the automatic stabilization and control system allowed the spacecraft to drift about a degree and a half per second to the right. Glenn switched control to manual-proportional control mode and moved &quot;Friendship 7&quot; back to the proper attitude. He tried different control modes to see which used the least fuel to maintain altitude. The manual fly-by-wire combination used the least fuel. After about twenty minutes, the yaw thruster began working again and Glenn switched back to the automatic control system. It worked for a short time and then began having problems again, this time with the opposite yaw thruster. He then switched back to the manual fly-by-wire system and flew the spacecraft in that mode for the remainder of the flight.

===Second orbit===
As &quot;Friendship 7&quot; crossed Cape Canaveral at the start of its second orbit, flight systems controller Don Arabian noticed that &quot;Segment 51&quot;, a sensor providing data on the spacecraft landing system, was giving a strange reading. According to the reading, the heat shield and landing bag were no longer locked in position. If this were the case, the heat shield was only being held against the spacecraft by the straps of the retro package. Mercury Control ordered all tracking sites to monitor &quot;Segment 51&quot; closely and advise Glenn that the landing-bag deploy switch should be in the &quot;off&quot; position.

Glenn was not immediately aware of the problem, but he became suspicious when site after site asked him to make sure that the landing-bag deploy switch was off. Meanwhile, &quot;Friendship 7&quot; was crossing the Atlantic for the second time. Glenn was busy manually keeping the spacecraft attitude correct and also trying to accomplish as many of the flight plan tasks as he could.

Crossing over the Canary Islands, Glenn observed that the &quot;fireflies&quot; outside the spacecraft had no connection with gas from the reaction control jets. His suit temperature felt too warm, but he did not take time to adjust it. The Kano, Nigeria and Zanzibar sites suddenly noticed a 12 percent drop in the spacecraft secondary oxygen supply.

During his second pass over the Indian Ocean, Glenn found that the Indian Ocean tracking ship was in heavy weather. The tracking station had planned to release balloons for a pilot observation experiment, but instead the ship fired star-shell parachute flares as &quot;Friendship 7&quot; passed overhead. Glenn was able to observe the flashes of lightning from storms in the area but was unable to see the flares.

The temperature in Glenn&#x27;s spacesuit was too warm. It had been since he passed over the Canary Islands, earlier in the second orbit. As he crossed the Indian Ocean, he tried to adjust the suit temperature. As he approached Woomera, Australia, a signal light came on warning him of excess cabin humidity. For the rest of the flight, Glenn had to carefully balance suit cooling against the cabin humidity.

While he was still over Australia, another warning light came on, indicating that the fuel supply for the automatic control system was down to 62%. Mercury Control recommended that Glenn let the spacecraft attitude drift to conserve fuel.

There were no more problems for &quot;Friendship 7&quot; during the remainder of the second orbit. Glenn continued to manually control the spacecraft attitude, not allowing it to drift too far out of alignment. In doing so, he consumed more fuel than a functioning automatic system would have used. Fuel consumption was from the automatic tank and from the manual tank during the second orbit. This amounted to almost 30% of the total fuel supply.

===Third orbit===
On the third orbit of &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, the Indian Ocean tracking ship did not attempt to launch any objects for pilot observation experiments, as the cloud coverage was still too thick. When the spacecraft came across Australia for the third time, Glenn joked with Cooper at the Muchea Tracking Station. Glenn asked Cooper to notify General Shoup, Commandant of the Marine Corps, that three orbits should meet the minimum monthly requirement of four hours&#x27; flying time. He also asked to be certified as eligible for his regular flight pay.

===Reentry===
During Glenn&#x27;s orbits, Mercury Control had been monitoring the problem with &quot;Segment 51&quot;. The Hawaiian tracking station asked Glenn to toggle the landing bag deploy switch into the automatic position. If a light came on, reentry should take place while retaining the retro pack. Given the earlier questions about the landing bag switch, Glenn realized the controllers must have found a possible problem with a loose heat shield. The test was run but no light appeared. Glenn also reported there were no bumping noises during spacecraft maneuvers.

Mercury Control was still undecided on the course of action to take. Some controllers thought the retrorocket pack should be jettisoned after retrofire, while other controllers thought the retro pack should be retained, as added assurance that the heat shield would stay in place. Mission Director Walter C. Williams decided to keep the retro pack in place during reentry, overruling Flight Director Chris Kraft. Walter Schirra, the California communicator at Point Arguello, relayed the instructions to Glenn: the retro pack should be retained until the spacecraft was over the Texas tracking station. After the mission was over, the &quot;Segment 51&quot; warning light problem was later determined to be a faulty sensor switch, meaning that the heat shield and landing bag were in fact secure during reentry.

Glenn was now preparing for reentry. Retaining the retro package meant he would have to retract the periscope manually. He would also have to activate the 0.05-g sequence by pushing the override switch. &quot;Friendship 7&quot; neared the California coast. It had been four hours and 33 minutes since launch. The spacecraft was maneuvered into retrofire attitude and the first retrorocket fired. &quot;Roger. Retros are firing. ... Are they ever. It feels like I&#x27;m going back toward Hawaii&quot;, Glenn radioed. The second and then the third retros fired at five-second intervals. The spacecraft attitude was steady during retrofire. Six minutes after retrofire, Glenn maneuvered the spacecraft into a 14-degree nose up pitch attitude for reentry.

&quot;Friendship 7&quot; lost altitude in its reentry glide over the continental United States, and headed toward splashdown in the Atlantic. The Texas tracking station told Glenn to retain the retro pack until the accelerometer read 1.5 &quot;g&quot; (14.7 m/s2). Glenn reported as he crossed Cape Canaveral that he had been controlling the spacecraft manually and would use the fly-by-wire mode as a backup. Mercury Control then gave him the 0.05 &quot;g&quot; (0.49 m/s2) mark, and he pressed the override button. About the same time, Glenn heard noises that sounded like &quot;small things brushing against the capsule&quot;. &quot;This is Friendship 7 – a real fireball outside,&quot; he radioed Mercury Control. A strap from the retro package broke partially loose and hung over the spacecraft window as it was consumed in the reentry plasma stream. The spacecraft control system was working well but the manual fuel supply was down to 15 percent. The peak of reentry deceleration was still to come. Glenn switched to fly-by-wire and the automatic tank supply. This combination had more available fuel.

The spacecraft now experienced peak reentry heating. Glenn later reported, &quot;I thought the retro pack had jettisoned and saw chunks coming off and flying by the window.&quot; He feared the chunks were pieces of his heat shield that might be disintegrating. The chunks were pieces of the retro package breaking up in the reentry fireball.

After passing the peak &quot;g&quot; region, &quot;Friendship 7&quot; began oscillating severely. The astronaut could not control the ship manually. The spacecraft was oscillating past 10 degrees on both sides of the vertical zero-degree point. &quot;I felt like a falling leaf,&quot; Glenn later said. He activated the auxiliary damping system, which helped to stabilize the large yaw and roll rates. Fuel in the automatic tanks was getting low. Glenn wondered if the spacecraft would retain stability until it was low enough to deploy the drogue parachute.

The automatic fuel supply ran out at 1 minute and 51 seconds, and manual fuel ran out at 51 seconds, before drogue chute deployment. The oscillations resumed. At , Glenn decided to deploy the drogue chute manually to regain attitude stability. Just before he reached the switch, the drogue chute opened automatically at instead of the programmed . The spacecraft regained stability and Glenn reported, &quot;everything was in good shape.&quot;

At the periscope opened and was available for the astronaut to use. Glenn tried to look out the overhead window instead, but it was coated with so much smoke and film that he could see very little. The spacecraft continued to descend on the drogue chute. The antenna section jettisoned and the main chute deployed and opened to its full diameter. Mercury Control reminded Glenn to manually deploy the landing bag. He toggled the switch and the green light confirmation came on. A &quot;clunk&quot; could be heard as the heat shield and landing bag dropped into place, below the capsule.

===Splashdown===
The spacecraft splashed down in the North Atlantic about northwest of Puerto Rico and near , short of the planned landing zone. Retrofire calculations had not taken into account spacecraft mass loss due to use of onboard consumables. , a destroyer code-named &quot;Steelhead&quot;, had spotted the spacecraft when it was descending on its parachute. The destroyer was about away when it radioed Glenn that it would reach him shortly. &quot;Noa&quot; came alongside &quot;Friendship 7&quot; seventeen minutes later.

One crewman cleared the spacecraft antenna and another crewman attached a line to hoist &quot;Friendship 7&quot; aboard. After being pulled from the water, the spacecraft bumped against the side of the destroyer. Once &quot;Friendship 7&quot; was on deck, Glenn intended to leave the capsule through the upper hatch, but it was too hot in the spacecraft and Glenn decided to blow the side hatch instead. He told the ship&#x27;s crew to stand clear and hit the hatch detonator plunger with the back of his hand. The detonator plunger recoiled, and slightly cut the astronaut&#x27;s knuckles through his glove. With a loud bang, the hatch was off. Harry Beal, the first U.S. Navy Seal, pulled Glenn out of &quot;Friendship 7&quot;. A smiling Glenn got out of &quot;Friendship 7&quot; and stood on the deck of &quot;Noa&quot;. His first words were, &quot;It was hot in there.&quot;

The astronaut and spacecraft came through the mission in good shape.

==Publicity==

=== Audience ===
CBS broadcast the flight with Walter Cronkite discussing it to an audience of &quot;[m]ost Americans&quot; and many Americans who did not watch on CBS saw the event on ABC or NBC.

=== &quot;The Fourth Orbit&quot; ===
After the return of &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, NASA announced on April 19, 1962, that the spacecraft would be lent to the United States Information Agency for a world tour. The tour included more than 20 stops, becoming known as the &quot;Fourth orbit of &quot;Friendship 7&quot;&quot;.

==Spacecraft location==
Mercury spacecraft # 13 – &quot;Friendship 7&quot; – is currently displayed at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, the National Air and Space Museum’s annex, in Chantilly, Virginia.

Philip Kaufman&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; includes a dramatization of the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; mission in which Ed Harris plays Glenn. The sequence depicts the spacecraft&#x27;s three orbits and Glenn&#x27;s responses to what he saw, sometimes quoted verbatim, as well as the concerns over the heat shield during reentry. The mysterious &quot;fireflies&quot; are also shown, but their true explanation is not revealed; instead they are depicted as magical protection summoned by Aboriginal Australians at the Muchea Tracking Station.

The 2016 film &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; features the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; mission in the climax of the movie, focusing on Katherine Johnson&#x27;s calculations of the landing.

==Anniversary commemoration==
To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flight in 2012, Glenn was surprised with the opportunity to speak with the orbiting crew of the International Space Station while Glenn was on-stage with NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden at Ohio State University, where the public affairs school is named in honor of Glenn.
