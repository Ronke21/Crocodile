<text>Estoppel is a judicial device whereby a court may prevent or &quot;estop&quot; a person from making assertions or from going back on their word. The person barred from doing so is said to be &quot;estopped&quot;. Estoppel may prevent someone from bringing a particular claim. In common law legal systems, the legal doctrine of estoppel is based in both common law and equity. 
Estoppel is also a concept in international law.

==Types of estoppel==
There are many different types of estoppel, but the common thread between them is that a person is restrained from asserting a particular position in law where it would be inequitable to do so. By way of illustration:

* If a landlord promises a tenant that he will not exercise his right to terminate a lease, and relying upon that promise the tenant spends money improving the premises, the doctrine of &quot;promissory estoppel&quot; may prevent the landlord from exercising a right to terminate, even though his promise might not otherwise have been legally binding as a contract. The landlord is precluded from asserting a specific &quot;right&quot;.
* If a person brings legal proceedings in one country claiming that a second person negligently injured them and the courts of that country determine that there was no negligence, then under the doctrine of &quot;issue estoppel&quot; the first person will not normally be able to argue before the courts of another country that the second person was negligent (whether in respect of the same claim or a related claim). The first person is precluded from asserting a specific &quot;claim&quot;.

Estoppel is traditionally an equitable doctrine. Accordingly, it is sometimes said that any person wishing to assert an estoppel must come to the court with &quot;clean hands&quot;.

The doctrine of estoppel (which may prevent a party from asserting a right) is often confused with the doctrine of waiver (which relates to relinquishing a right once it has arisen). It also substantially overlaps with, but is distinct from, the equitable doctrine of laches.

==Etymology and usage==
&quot;Estop&quot; is a verb of Anglo-Norman origin meaning &quot;to seal up&quot;, while the noun &quot;estoppel&quot; is based on Old French &quot;estoupail&quot; (stopper). When a court finds that a party has done something warranting a form of estoppel, that party is said to be estopped from making certain related arguments or claiming certain related rights. The defendant is estopped from presenting the related defense, or the plaintiff is estopped from making the related argument against the defendant. Lord Coke stated, &quot;It is called an estoppel or conclusion, because a man&#x27;s own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth.&quot;

== Overview ==
Estoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence whereby a person is barred from leading evidence of a fact that has already been settled or they are otherwise precluded from asserting, but that may be an oversimplification. Firstly, although some estoppels relate to preventing a party from asserting &quot;facts&quot;, others relate to preventing a party from asserting a &quot;right&quot; or a &quot;claim&quot;. Secondly, under the conflict of laws in common law jurisdictions, matters of evidence are usually treated as procedural matters for the law of the local court (the ), whereas it is generally accepted that an estoppel may affect substantive rights and are therefore matters to be determined by the proper law (or ) that governs the particular issue.

There are many different types of estoppel that can arise under common law legal systems. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasion that the link between them is often somewhat tenuous. &quot;Treitel on Contracts&quot; notes that &quot;unconscionabilityÂ ... provides the link between them&quot;, but they nevertheless have &quot;separate requirements and different terrains of application&quot;. The courts have long abandoned an attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle:
The plea of estoppel is often closely connected with the plea of waiver, the object of both being to ensure bona fides in day-to-day transactions. It is also related to the doctrines of variation and election. It is applied in many areas of contract law, including insurance, banking, and employment. In English law, the concept of legitimate expectation in the realm of administrative law and judicial review is estoppel&#x27;s counterpart in public law.

Promissory estoppel is often applied where there is a promise or an agreement made without consideration. When used as a defense by a defendant it is sometimes called a &quot;shield&quot;, and when used affirmatively by a plaintiff it is sometimes called a &quot;sword&quot;. It is most commonly used as a shield, with some commentators stating that it can only be used as a shield, although this varies with jurisdictions.

=== Examples ===
Estoppel can be understood by considering examples such as the following:

#A city entered into a contract with another party. The contract stated that it had been reviewed by the city&#x27;s counsel and that the contract was proper. Estoppel applied to estop the city from claiming the contract was invalid.
#A creditor unofficially informs a debtor that the creditor forgives the debt between them. Even if such forgiveness is not formally documented, the creditor may be estopped from changing its mind and seeking to collect the debt, because that change would be unfair.
#A landlord informs a tenant that rent has been reduced, for example, because there was construction or a lapse in utility services. If the tenant relies on this statement in choosing to remain in the premises, the landlord could be estopped from collecting the full rent.

=== Types ===
Some types of estoppel under English, Australian, and American laws are as follows:

==== In civil cases ====
*Reliance-based estoppels: These involve one party relying on something the other party has done or said. The party who performed/spoke is the one who is estopped. This category is discussed below.
*Estoppel by record: This frequently arises as issue/cause of action estoppel or judicial estoppel where the orders or judgments made in previous legal proceedings prevent the parties from relitigating the same issues or causes of action.
*Estoppel by deed: Situations where rules of evidence prevent a litigant from denying the truth of what was said or done.
*Estoppel by silence or acquiescence: Estoppel that prevents a person from asserting something when he had the right and opportunity to do so earlier, and such silence put another person at a disadvantage.
*Laches: Estoppel after a litigant deliberately and avoidably delays an action so as to disadvantage an adversary.

==== In American criminal cases ====
*Entrapment by estoppel: In American criminal law, although &quot;ignorance of the law is no excuse&quot; is a principle which generally holds for traditional (older common law) crimes, courts sometimes allow this excuse as a defense, when defendant can show they reasonably relied on an interpretation of the law by the public official(s) charged with enforcement or interpretation of that law, such as a regulatory official (even if that official&#x27;s interpretation is later determined to be wrong). The defense is based on &quot;fairness&quot; principles in the Fifth Amendment. It generally involves determination of fact, not of law, except as to determination of whether the interpreting government official had the legal status asserted by the defense.

=== In patent law ===
Estoppel is relevant and applied in U.S. patent law.

Acceptance of background documents by the patent office into a granted patent efficiently gives rise to estoppel on any opposition based on the same documents. In effect, when the background section lists a document, it cannot be used to dispute the novelty of the patent. This is because the acceptance of the background by the patent office implies that the matter presented is already considered to be within the &quot;state of the art&quot; at the time when the patent is granted, and still distinct from the patent claim. For the patent applicant, sufficient inclusion of relevant prior art therefore protects the patent from dispute.

There are many types of estoppel applied in patent law, such as collateral estoppel, prosecution history estoppel (e.g. in the landmark case Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.) and 315(e) estoppel, which estops the petitioner from re-applying the same grounds in court that they already applied in an inter partes review.

== Reliance-based estoppels ==
Reliance-based estoppels (at English law) include:
*by representation of fact, where one person asserts the truth of a set of facts to another;
*promissory estoppel, where one person makes a promise to another, but there is no enforceable contract; and
*proprietary estoppel, where the parties are litigating the title to land.
Both &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s&quot; and Spencer Bower (see below) describe these three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. More simply, one party must say or do something and see the other party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.

All reliance-based estoppels require the victimised party to show both &quot;inducement&quot; and &quot;detrimental reliance&quot;, i.e.:
* there must be evidence to show that the representor actually intended the victim to act on the representation or promise, or
* the victim must satisfy the court that it was reasonable for him or her to act on the relevant representation or promise, and
* what the victim did must either have been reasonable, or
* the victim did what the representor intended, and
* the victim would suffer a loss or &quot;detriment&quot; if the representor was allowed to deny what was said or doneâdetriment is measured at the time when the representor proposes to deny the representation or withdraw the promise, not at the time when either was made, and
* in all the circumstances, the behavior of the representor is such that it would be &quot;unconscionable&quot; to allow him or her to resile.

Simply put, promissory estoppel has four necessary elements which the plaintiff must prove:
* there was a promise
* that was reasonably relied upon
* resulting in legal detriment to the promisee
* justice requires enforcement of the promise

Estoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on a representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e. it expresses an intention as to the future). A promissory estoppel operates only between parties who, at the time of the representation, were in an existing relationship, while this is not a requirement for estoppel by representation of fact.

The test for unconscionability in the English and Australian courts takes many factors into account, including the behavior, state of mind and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative:
*how the promise/representation and reliance upon it were induced;
*the content of the promise/representation;
*the relative knowledge of the parties;
*the parties&#x27; relative interest in the relevant activities in reliance;
*the nature and context of the parties&#x27; relationship;
*the parties&#x27; relative strength of position;
*the history of the parties&#x27; relationship; and
*the steps, if any, taken by the promisor/representor to ensure he has not caused preventable harm.

But in &quot;Cobbe v Yeoman&#x27;s Row&quot;, Lord Scott of Foscote stated the following:

=== England and Wales ===
==== Estoppel by representation of fact ====
In English law, estoppel by representation of fact is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as &quot;common law estoppel by representation&quot; in &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England&quot;, vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.

Spencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:

A second definition comes from Sean Wilken and Theresa Villiers:

A representation can be made by words or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care has arisen. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact usually acts as a defence, though it may act in support of a cause of action or counterclaim.

==== Equitable estoppel ====

Under English and Australian legal systems, &quot;estoppels in equity&quot; include promissory and proprietary estoppels, described below. (Contrast with estoppel by representation, which is a claim (under the English system) at law.)

===== Proprietary estoppel =====

In English law, &quot;proprietary estoppel&quot; is distinct from promissory estoppel. Proprietary estoppel is not a concept in American law, but a similar result is often reached under the general doctrine of promissory estoppel.

Traditionally, proprietary estoppel arose in relation to rights to use the land of the owner, and possibly in connection with disputed transfers of ownership. Although proprietary estoppel was only traditionally available in disputes affecting title to real property, it has now gained limited acceptance in other areas of law. Proprietary estoppel is closely related to the doctrine of constructive trust.

Fry J summarized the five elements for proprietary estoppel as:

* the claimant
** made a mistake as to his legal rights (typically because the actual owner attempted to convey the property, but the transfer is invalid or ineffective for some reason);
** did some act of reliance;
* the defendant
** knows of the existence of a legal right which he (the defendant) possesses, and which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the claimant;
** knows of the claimant&#x27;s mistaken belief; and
** encouraged the claimant in his act of reliance.

Example: A father promised a house to his son who took possession and spent a large sum of money improving the property, but the father never actually transferred the house to the son. Upon the father&#x27;s death, the son claimed to be the equitable owner. The court found the testamentary trustees (as representatives of the deceased father&#x27;s estate) were &quot;estopped&quot; from denying the son&#x27;s proprietary interest, and ordered them to convey the land to the son.

===== Promissory estoppel =====
The doctrine of &quot;promissory estoppel&quot; prevents one party from withdrawing a promise made to a second party if the latter has reasonably relied on that promise.

A promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable. It is known as a bare or gratuitous promise. Thus, if a car salesman promises a potential buyer not to sell a certain car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. But should the car salesman accept from the potential buyer even one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise will be enforceable in court by the potential buyer. Estoppel extends the court&#x27;s purview even to cases where there is no consideration, though it is generally not a &#x27;sword&#x27;: not a basis on which to initiate a lawsuit.

In English jurisprudence, the doctrine of &quot;promissory estoppel&quot; was first developed in &quot;Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co&quot; [1877] but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by Denning J in the controversial case of &quot;Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd&quot;.

Promissory estoppel requires:
#an unequivocal promise by words or conduct
#evidence that there is a change in position of the promisee as a result of the promise (reliance but &quot;not necessarily to their detriment&quot;)
#inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise

In general, estoppel is &quot;a shield not a sword&quot;âit cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In &quot;High Trees&quot; the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent from early 1945, and could have restored the full rent at any time after the initial promise was made provided a suitable period of notice had been given. In this case, the estoppel was applied to a &quot;negative promise&quot;, that is, one where a party promises not to enforce full rights.

Estoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and its application is therefore discretionary. In the case of &quot;D &amp; C Builders v Rees&quot; the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of Â£300 on a debt of Â£482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In &quot;Combe v Combe&quot; Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a &quot;sword&quot; by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.

The general rule is that when one party agrees to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, the debtor has given no consideration, and so the creditor is still entitled to claim the debt in its entirety. This is not the case if the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed, because the benefit to the creditor of receiving payment early can be thought of as consideration for the promise to waive the rest of the debt. This is the rule formulated in &quot;Pinnel&#x27;s Case&quot;, and affirmed in &quot;Foakes v Beer&quot;.

The decision of the Court of Appeal in &quot;Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd&quot; suggests that the doctrine of promissory estoppel can now operate to mitigate the harshness of this common law rule. Moreover, Arden LJ held that allowing a creditor to renege on his promise to forebear seeking the balance of a debt in return for part payment would be, in and of itself, inequitable. Therefore, the only reliance that the promisee must demonstrate is the actual making of the part payment. This approach has been criticised as doing violence to the principle set down in &quot;Hughes&quot; and the extent to which the other members of the Court, namely Longmore LJ, agreed with it is uncertain.

=== United States ===
==== Equitable estoppel ====
Equitable estoppel is the American counterpart to estoppel by representation. Its elements are summarized as:
*Facts misrepresented or concealed
*Knowledge of true facts
*Fraudulent intent
*Inducement and reliance
*Injury to complainant
*Clear, concise, unequivocal proof of actus (not by implication)

For example, in &quot;Aspex Eyewear v. Clariti Eyewear&quot;, eyeglass frame maker Aspex sued competitor Clariti for patent infringement. Aspex waited three years, without responding to a request that it list the infringed patent claims, before asserting its patent in litigation. During this period, Clariti expanded its marketing and sales of the products. The Federal Circuit found that Aspex misled Clariti to believe it would not enforce its patent, and thus estopped Aspex from proceeding with the suit.

Another example of equitable estoppel is the case of Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, an Indian emigrant and lawyer who was granted American citizenship in 1914 due to his designation as &quot;white&quot;. Subsequently, Pandit bought property, was admitted to the California bar, married a white woman, and renounced his rights to property and inheritance in British India. Following the Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. Thind&quot;, which found that Indians were considered non-white, and in which Pandit represented the applicant, Bhagat Singh Thind, the US government moved to strip Pandit of his &quot;illegally procured&quot; citizenship. Pandit successfully challenged the denaturalization, arguing that under equitable estoppel, he would be unjustly harmed by losing his citizenship, as it would cause him to become stateless, lose his profession as a lawyer, and make his marriage illegal. In &quot;U.S. v. Pandit&quot;, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Pandit&#x27;s citizenship, ending denaturalization processes against him and other Indian-Americans.

==== Promissory estoppel ====
In many jurisdictions of the United States, &quot;promissory estoppel&quot; is an alternative to consideration as a basis for enforcing a promise. It is also sometimes called &quot;detrimental reliance.&quot;

The American Law Institute in 1932 included the principle of estoppel into Â§ 90 of the Restatement of Contracts, stating:

The Restatement (Second) removed the requirement that the detriment be &quot;substantial&quot;.

However:

Suppose that B goes to a store and sees a sign that the price of a radio is $10. B tells the shopkeeper that he will get the money and come back later that day to purchase it; there is no discussion of price. The shopkeeper says that when B returns, he will welcome B as a customerâunless he sells all three of his radios first. Hearing this, B goes and sells his watch for $10 (it was really worth $15, but since B wanted the money right away, he chose not to wait for the best price). When B returns, the sign says $11, and the owner tells B that he has raised the price. In equity, can it be argued that the shopkeeper is estopped by conduct? B relied upon the implied representation that a radio would be sold for $10 when he returned with the money; B has sold his watch at a discount, to his detriment. (This element would be absent if B sold the watch at the market price.) But the shopkeeper did not guarantee to hold one of the radios against the possibility of B&#x27;s return nor did they agree a fixed price.

In some common-law jurisdictions, a promise by the shopkeeper to hold a specific radio would create a binding contract, even if B had to go for the money. A &quot;promise&quot; to pay the owner in the future is good consideration if it is made in exchange for a promise to sell a specific radio (one from three is probably sufficiently specific): one promise in exchange for a second promise creates equal value. So the shopkeeper&#x27;s actual words and knowledge are critical to deciding whether either a contract or an estoppel arises.

The drafters of the Second Restatement debated how to calculate the amount of damages flowing from a promissory estoppel, using the following example: A young man&#x27;s uncle promises to give him $1,000 to buy a car. The young man buys a car for $500, but the uncle refuses to pay any money. Is the young man entitled to $1,000 (the amount promised), or merely $500 (the amount he actually lost)? The Restatement states that &quot;The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires&quot;âleaving quantification to the discretion of the court.

== Other estoppels ==

=== Pais ===
&quot;Estoppel in pais&quot; (literally &quot;by act of notoriety&quot;, or &quot;solemn formal act&quot;) is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel. The terms &quot;estoppel in pais&quot; and &quot;equitable estoppel&quot; are used interchangeably in American law.

=== Convention ===
&quot;Estoppel by convention&quot; in English law (also known as &quot;estoppel by agreement&quot;) occurs where two parties negotiate or operate a contract but make a mistake. If they share an assumption, belief, or understanding of the contract&#x27;s interpretation or legal effect, then they are bound by it, if:

#They both knew the other had the same belief, and
#They both based their subsequent dealings on those beliefs.

Estoppel by convention is most commonly invoked if one party wishes to rely on pre-contract negotiation as an aid to construction of the contract.

It is debatable whether &quot;estoppel by convention&quot; is a separate estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of &quot;reliance-based estoppel&quot; (&quot;estoppel by representation&quot; would be its most frequent form), or of the rule of interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see &quot;Amalgamated Investment and Property Co Ltd v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd&quot; [1982] QB 84).

=== Acquiescence ===
&quot;Estoppel by acquiescence&quot; may arise when one person gives a legal warning to another based on some clearly asserted facts or legal principle, and the other does not respond within &quot;a reasonable period of time&quot;. By &quot;acquiescing&quot;, the other person is generally considered to have lost the legal right to assert the contrary.

As an example, suppose that Jill has been storing her car on Jack&#x27;s land with no contract between them. Jack sends a registered letter to Jill&#x27;s legal address, stating: &quot;I am no longer willing to allow your car to stay here for free. Please come get your car, or make arrangements to pay me rent for storing it. If you do not do so, within 30 days, I will consider the car abandoned and will claim ownership of it. If you need more time to make arrangements, please contact me within 30 days, and we can work something out.&quot; If Jill does not respond, she may be said to have &quot;relinquished&quot; her ownership of the car, and &quot;estoppel by acquiescence&quot; may prevent any court from invalidating Jack&#x27;s actions of registering the car in his name and using it as his own.

=== Contractual ===

The law relating to contractual estoppel (in English law) was summarised in :

=== Deed ===
&quot;Estoppel by deed&quot; is a rule of evidence arising from the status of a contract signed under sealâsuch agreements, called deeds, are more strictly enforced than ordinary contracts and the parties are expected to take greater care to verify the contents before signing them. Hence, once signed, all statements of fact (usually found in the opening recital which sets out the reason(s) for making the deed) are conclusive evidence against the parties who are estopped from asserting otherwise.

=== Conflict estoppel ===
&quot;[O]ne who by his speech or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner ought not be permitted to adopt an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct may not be adopted to loss or injury of another&quot;. For example, as between two or more claimants, a party that takes multiple and inconsistent legal positions is estopped to assert its positions against another consistent and certain claim, i.e. preferential treatment for certain over uncertain claims.

===Issue estoppel===

Issue estoppel (more commonly known as issue preclusion) prevents, in some cases, an issue that has already been litigated and decided on the merits from being re-litigated, even when the parties are different. In the world of crime, some cases have achieved notoriety, e.g. in the Birmingham Six saga, the House of Lords ruled in &quot;Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police&quot; (1982) that &quot;issue estoppel&quot; applied. Lord Diplock said:

A variant of issue estoppel also precludes a party from bringing a claim in subsequent proceedings which ought properly to have been brought as part of earlier legal proceedings.

==In other countries==
=== Civil law ===
There is no principle of estoppel in European civil law. Instead, the coherence principle is followed, which has the equivalent effect of prohibiting inconsistent conduct. The Lex Mercatoria, a medieval body of commercial law, included the principle &quot;Nemo potest venire contra factum proprium&quot;, &quot;no one can come against their own acts&quot;. This stipulates that a party to a contract may not set itself in contradiction to its previous conduct, if the other party has relied on such conduct. Such inconsistency is prohibited, because can cause harm to the other party and allow the party to evade contractual provisions. The principle is included in the French civil code and was introduced to the international UNIDROIT principles in 2004.

=== Australia ===
The doctrine of promissory estoppel was adopted into Australian law in &quot;Legione v Hateley&quot;. However, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful in that case because the reliance was unreasonable and the promise not unequivocal.

Australian law has now gone beyond the position espoused in the English &quot;High Trees&quot; case, to cases where there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the two parties, and promissory estoppel can be wielded as a &quot;sword&quot;, not just as a &quot;shield&quot;. Mason CJ and Wilson J in &quot;Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher&quot; held that if estoppel is proven, it gives rise to an equity in favour of the plaintiff, and the court will do the minimum equity that is just in the circumstances. From this case, it is also possible for the promise to come from silence or inaction.

Stated by Brennan J in &quot;Waltons Stores&quot;: 

Although there is some debate as to whether &quot;unconscionability&quot; is an element that English courts need to take into account when considering estoppel by representation of fact, the Australian courts clearly do. This element is satisfied if one party encourages the other party to create assumptions that lead to reliance.

Today, the principle of estoppel may give birth to an enforceable obligation even without a consideration under the following conditions:
# promise
# dishonest behaviour of the promisor
# special relationship between the promisor and the promisee, (e.g., duty of information);
# irreversible change of position on the part of the promisee

When enforcing an estoppel, Australian courts will look to the impact that enforcement will have on others, especially third parties. Relief in estoppel thus remains discretionary, and will not always be granted based on the expectation of the plaintiff.

The status of estoppel by representation of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat estoppel by representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel. This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.

Whilst there also exists a doctrine of proprietary estoppel, the High Court of Australia merged this doctrine with the doctrine of promissory estoppel by virtue of their similar criteria.

Nonetheless, authority for the doctrine of proprietary estoppel indicates that if a landlord allows a licensee to expend money on the land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he/she will be able to remain there, and the licensee suffers a detriment in relying on that expectation, an equity arises in the licensee such as to entitle him/her to stay. Where a proprietary estoppel is found to exist, the court does not have to grant the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the land subject to the dispute. It may instead make an order that the plaintiff receive equitable compensation.

=== India ===
Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act defines estoppel: &quot;When one person has, by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.&quot;

So, for instance, if A intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to A, and thereby induces B to buy and pay for it, and only later does A acquire the land, then A is not allowed to argue to void the sale on the ground that, at the time of the sale, he had no title.

The doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that consistency in word and action imparts certainty and honesty to human affairs. If a person makes a representation to another, on the faith of which the latter acts, to his prejudice, the former cannot recant the representation.

However, estoppel has no application to representations made regarding the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution of India, the source of all laws, which exists not only to benefit individuals but to secure collective rights. Thus, no one can barter away the freedoms conferred upon him by the Constitution. A concession made by him in a proceeding, whether under a mistake of law or otherwise, that he does not possess or will not enforce any particular fundamental right, cannot estop him, as enforcing estoppel would defeat the purpose of the Constitution.

<doc id="221256" wikidata="Q332449" url="?curid=221256" title="William Blackstone">
<text>Sir William Blackstone (10 July 1723 â 14 February 1780) was an English jurist, justice and Tory politician most noted for his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, which became the best-known description of the doctrines of the English common law. Born into a middle-class family in London, Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1738. After switching to and completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, he was made a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, on 2 November 1743, admitted to Middle Temple, and called to the Bar there in 1746. Following a slow start to his career as a barrister, Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration, becoming accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750. Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building, and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. These were massively successful, earning him a total of Â£453 (Â£ in terms), and led to the publication of &quot;An Analysis of the Laws of England&quot; in 1756, which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.

On 20 October 1759 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law, immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise, titled &quot;A Discourse on the Study of the Law&quot;. With his growing fame, he successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice, also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761. In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;; the completed work earned Blackstone Â£14,000 (Â£ in terms). After repeated failures, he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench on 16 February 1770, leaving to replace Edward Clive as a justice of the Common Pleas on 25 June. He remained in this position until his death, on 14 February 1780.

Blackstone&#x27;s four-volume &quot;Commentaries&quot; were designed to provide a complete overview of English law and were repeatedly republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the Second World War. Legal education in England had stalled; Blackstone&#x27;s work gave the law &quot;at least a veneer of scholarly respectability&quot;. William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone&#x27;s successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that &quot;If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that the United States, and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law.&quot; In the United States, the &quot;Commentaries&quot; influenced Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, James Wilson, John Jay, John Adams, James Kent and Abraham Lincoln, and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions.

==Early life and education==
Blackstone was the fourth and posthumous son of Charles Blackstone, a silk mercer from Cheapside, the son of a wealthy apothecary. He became firm friends with Thomas Bigg, a surgeon and the son of Lovelace Bigg, a gentleman from Wiltshire. After Bigg&#x27;s sister Mary came to London, Charles eventually persuaded her to marry him in 1718. This was not seen as a good match for her, but the couple lived happily and had four sons, three of whom lived into adulthood. Charles (born August 1719) and Henry (May 1722), both became fellows of New College, Oxford, and took holy orders. Their last son, William, was born on 10 July 1723, five months after Charles&#x27; death in February.

Although Charles and Mary Blackstone were members of the middle class rather than landed gentry, they were particularly prosperous. Tax records show Charles Blackstone to have been the second most prosperous man in the parish in 1722, and death registers show that the family had several servants. This, along with Thomas Bigg&#x27;s assistance to the family following Charles&#x27; death, helps explain the educational upbringing of the children. William Blackstone was sent to Charterhouse School in 1730 having been nominated by Charles Wither, a relative of Mary Blackstone. William did well there, and became head of the school by age 15. However, after Charles&#x27; death the family fortunes declined, and after Mary died (5 January 1736) the family&#x27;s resources largely went to meet unpaid bills. William was able to remain at Charterhouse as a &quot;poor scholar&quot;, having been named to that position in June 1735 after being nominated by Sir Robert Walpole.

Blackstone revelled in Charterhouse&#x27;s academic curriculum, particularly the Latin poetry of Ovid and Virgil. He began to attract note as a poet at school, writing a 30-line set of rhyming couplets to celebrate the wedding of James Hotchkis, the headmaster. He also won a silver medal for his Latin verses on John Milton, gave the annual Latin oration in 1738, and was noted as having been the favourite student of his masters. On 1 October 1738, taking advantage of a new scholarship available to Charterhouse students, Blackstone matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford.

==Oxford==

===Study===

There are few surviving records of Blackstone&#x27;s undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College had been set out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry. Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry, with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens&#x27; 1781 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Many of Blackstone&#x27;s undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts. The last element is understandable, given his family&#x27;s theological interests, but the more surprising element is the sheer number of texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.

On 9 July 1740, after only a year and a half as a Bachelor of Arts student, Blackstone was admitted to study for a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, civil law being the only legal area recognised by his university. This degree course was seven years long, the first two &quot;supposedly devoted to a broad course of reading in humane studies&quot;, which allowed him to study his own interests. On 20 November 1741 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, the first step on the road to becoming a barrister, but this imposed no obligations and simply allowed a legal career to be an option. At the time there was no proper legal education system, and Blackstone read (in his own time) &quot;Coke on Littleton&quot;, the works of Henry Finch, and related legal tracts.

In addition to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of &quot;The Lawyer to his Muse&quot;, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published &quot;Elements of Architecture&quot; and &quot;An Abridgement of Architecture&quot;, two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was &quot;The Pantheon: A Vision&quot;, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator&#x27;s walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.

His call to the Bar saw Blackstone begin to alternate between Oxford and London, occupying chambers in Pump Court but living at All Souls College. As the central courts only sat for three months of the year, the rest of his time was spent on Assize when his work at All Souls permitted. He regularly acted as a law reporter; his personal notes on cases start with &quot;Hankey v Trotman&quot; (1746). Blackstone&#x27;s barrister practice began slowly; his first case in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench was in 1748, and he had only 6 additional motions there through 1751. Two appearances in the Court of Chancery are also noted, and he is known to have been consulted in Roger Newdigate&#x27;s long-running lawsuit there, but his early court appearances are infrequent. This is considered to have been due to his call to the Bar occurring at the same time as the massive contraction in business by the central courts, along with his singular lack of connections due to his status as an orphan from the middle class; he was described as &quot;unrecognised and unemployed&quot;. He filled his time by acting as counsel for Oxford, and from May 1749 with his election as Recorder of Wallingford.

===University administration===

While dividing his time, Blackstone became an administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746. Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, is attributed to his work. In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a &quot;perfectionist zeal&quot; in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, &quot;An Essay on Collateral Consanguinity&quot;, which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls in an attempt to gain preeminence in elections. Completion of his Doctor of Civil Law degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to Convocation, the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two burgesses who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers. With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to &quot;no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [and] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself&quot;, which was to give a set of lectures on the common law â the first lectures of that sort in the world.

This was not entirely out of benevolence; according to Prest, Blackstone was likely aware that an Oxford alumnus, Charles Viner, was planning to endow a professorship of English law. The Regius Professorship of Civil Law had also become vacant in 1753; despite support from Lord Mansfield, Blackstone had been rejected in favour of Robert Jenner, widely considered Blackstone&#x27;s lesser intellectually but a far greater political mind. In addition, a private lecture series would be extremely lucrative. While his All Souls fellowship gave him Â£70 a year, records show that the lecture series brought him Â£116, Â£226 and Â£111 a year respectively from 1753 to 1755 â a total of Â£453 (Â£ in terms). A prospectus was issued on 23 June 1753, and with a class of approximately 20 students, the first set of lectures were completed by July 1754. Despite Blackstone&#x27;s limited oratory skills and a speaking style described by Jeremy Bentham as &quot;formal, precise and affected&quot;, Blackstone&#x27;s lectures were warmly appreciated. The second and third series were far more popular, partly due to the then unusual use of printed handouts and lists of suggested reading. No copies of these handouts exist, but Alexander Popham, later a close friend of Blackstone, attended the lectures and made notes, which survive. These show Blackstone&#x27;s attempts to reduce English law to a logical system, with the division of subjects later being the basis for his &quot;Commentaries&quot;.

Following his lecture series, Blackstone became more prominent in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge at the time had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor&#x27;s Court, Blackstone became far more involved in the university&#x27;s peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court&#x27;s practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, &quot;Friendship: An Ode&quot;, in 1756.

In 1756 Blackstone published the first of his full legal texts, the 200 page &quot;An Analysis of the Laws of England&quot;. Published by the Clarendon Press, the treatise was intended to demonstrate the &quot;Order, and principal Divisions&quot; of his lecture series, and a structured introduction to English law. Prest calls this &quot;a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law ... including constitutional, civil and criminal law, public and private law, substantive law and procedure, as well as some introductory jurisprudential content&quot;. The initial print run of 1,000 copies almost immediately sold out, leading to the printing of three more 1,000-book lots over the next three years, which all sold out. A fifth edition was published in 1762, and a sixth, edited to take into account Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, in 1771. Because of the success of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Prest remarks that &quot;relatively little scholarly attention has been paid to this work&quot;; at the time, however, it was hailed as &quot;an elegant performance ... calculated to facilitate this branch of knowledge&quot;.

===Vinerian Professor of English Law===
On 8 March 1758, the group executing Charles Viner&#x27;s will reported to Convocation that Viner recommended creating a Chair of English Law, with a Â£200 salary. After much debate, this position was created, and on 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law. On 24 October he gave his first lecture, to &quot;a crowded audience&quot;; the text was soon printed and published as &quot;A Discourse on the Study of the Law&quot;. The lecture was tremendously popular, being described as a &quot;sensible, spirited and manly exhortation to the study of the law&quot;; the initial print run sold out, necessitating the publication of another 1,000 copies, and it was used to preface later versions of the &quot;Analysis&quot; and the first volume of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;. Within the university, however, Blackstone was not as popular. As soon as the lecture series opened, an anonymously written open letter was published charging that Blackstone had &quot;violated the Statutes of the University, by arbitrarily changing the Day appointed for reading his solemn Lectures&quot;. Blackstone suffered a nervous breakdown soon after the first lecture, and on 24 November he launched a suit in the Chancellor&#x27;s Court against &quot;William Jackson of the City of Oxford Printer&quot; for Â£500 damages, justified by Jackson &quot;printing and publishing a scandalous Libell notoriously reflecting on the Character of him the said William Blackstone&quot;. Jackson had refused to reveal who ordered the anonymous pamphlet, leading to the suit, but it evidently did not proceed further.

This suit, along with the struggle over the Vinerian Professorship and other controversies, damaged his reputation within the university, as evidenced by his failure to win election as Vice Warden in April 1759, losing to John White. Prest attributes Blackstone&#x27;s unpopularity to specific personality traits, saying his &quot;determination...in pursuit of causes to which he committed himself could irritate as well as intimidate those of a more relaxed disposition. While quick to take offence at perceived slights on his own character and motives, he could also show surprising indifference to the effect his words and actions might have on others&quot;. This marked the beginning of his break with Oxford, which coincided with his growing influence outside the university. In 1759 Lord Bute, Prince George&#x27;s official tutor, requested copies of Blackstone&#x27;s lectures, which he forwarded. Later that year Blackstone was paid Â£200 by the Prince, who became an &quot;appreciative, loyal, and soon to be incomparably influential patron&quot;. This patronage, and Blackstone&#x27;s purchase of a set of chambers in the Inner Temple, also transferring to that Inn, were significant steps in his departure from Oxford. In 1759 Blackstone published another two works, &quot;The Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest, with other authentic Instruments&quot;, described as a &quot;major piece of pioneering scholarship&quot; leading to Blackstone&#x27;s election to the Society of Antiquaries in February 1761, and &quot;A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple&quot;, which was later used, almost verbatim, as chapters 14 and 15 of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;.

===Work at the Bar===
With sponsorship from the Prince of Wales and his success with the &quot;Analysis&quot;, Blackstone began work as a barrister, although he kept up his lecture series at Oxford. By 1760 he had become &quot;a very eminent figure indeed in the world of letters&quot;, and his legal practice grew as a result. Although not considered a great barrister of the period, he maintained a steady flow of cases, primarily in the King&#x27;s Bench and Exchequer of Pleas. On the death of the third Earl of Abingdon, Blackstone was retained as counsel for the executors and trustees to oversee the family&#x27;s attempts to pay off debts and meet other obligations. On 5 May 1761 he married Sarah Clitherow, a member of a family of lesser gentry from Middlesex. Their first child, William Bertie Blackstone, born 21 August 1762, did not survive to adulthood. Seven more children were born: Henry, James, Sarah, Mary, Philippa, William, Charles, and George, who also died in childhood. The Blackstones had a large estate in Wallingford in Berkshire, including 120 acres (46 ha) of pastureland around the River Thames and the right of advowson over St Peter&#x27;s Church.

In February 1761 Blackstone was considered as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect â at the same time refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in &quot;Tonson v Collins&quot;, a copyright case, &quot;Thiquet v Bath&quot;, an important case on international law, and &quot;R v d&#x27;Eon&quot;, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV&#x27;s newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.

With this increase in his practice, Blackstone also saw an increase in his out-of-court work, writing opinions and recommendations for various Oxford colleges, the MP Jonathan Rashleigh and the fourth Earl of Abingdon, who paid him to draft several private Acts of Parliament. In December 1761, he asked Lord Shelburne, a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as Chief Justice of Chester, writing again in July 1762 to &quot;prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty&#x27;s Notice&quot;, anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas. Parliamentary service was considered a &quot;desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would-be English judges&quot;, something that did not necessarily bode well for Blackstone. Naturally inarticulate and reticent, he was an infrequent and &quot;indifferent&quot; speaker during his first session of Parliament, speaking only 14 times in seven years. His chosen career did lend him to politics, in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees to provide them with technical expertise in drafting legislation. He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762, after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up, but lost to George Perrott, a leading Exchequer barrister. The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone, after the appointment of Lord Camden (a Whig) as Lord Chancellor.

===Commentaries on the Laws of England===
In 1765 Blackstone announced his resignation from the Vinerian Chair, effective after his 1766 lectures. These were divided into two 14-lecture series, on &quot;private wrongs&quot; and &quot;public wrongs&quot; delivered between 12 February and 24 April. At this point Blackstone had published nothing new since &quot;A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple&quot; in 1759. The decision to resign was most likely due to the increasing demands of his legal practice and the reduced profit from the lectures, which, after peaking at Â£340 in 1762, dropped to Â£239 a year later and to Â£203 for the final round of lectures in 1765â6. In response, Blackstone decided to publish a new book â &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;. The first volume was published in November 1765, bringing the author Â£1,600 â the full work would eventually bring in over Â£14,000. Owen Ruffhead described Volume I as &quot;masterly&quot;, noting that &quot;Mr Blackstone is perhaps the first who has treated the body of the law in a liberal, elegant and constitutional manner. A vein of good sense and moderation runs through every page&quot;. Every copy was sold within six months, and the second and third volumes, published in October 1766 and June 1768, received a similar reception. The fourth and final volume appeared in 1769, dealing with Criminal Law. With the financial success of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Blackstone moved in 1768 from his London property in Carey Fields to No. 55 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Neighbours included the Sardinian ambassador, Sir Walter Rawlinson, Lord Northington, John Morton and the Third Earl of Abingdon, making it an appropriate house for a &quot;great and able Lawyer&quot;.

Blackstone&#x27;s treatise was republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the Second World War. The first American edition was produced in 1772; prior to this, over 1,000 copies had already been sold in the Thirteen Colonies.

===Judge===

Even after the publication of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Blackstone&#x27;s chances of judicial appointment remained slim. While he was old enough, experienced enough and widely respected, the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone&#x27;s lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his chances. In January 1770, however, Lord Grafton&#x27;s government began to fall, with Camden resigning on 17 January and Solicitor-General John Dunning, following him. George III appointed Lord North as Prime Minister, and North picked Charles Yorke as Lord Chancellor. Yorke&#x27;s death on 20 January, after holding the position for less than three days, left several important legal positions within the government open. As such, Blackstone, now MP for Westbury, was apparently approached to become Solicitor-General; he refused, not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position.

On 9 February 1770 â apparently with the intervention of the King, and possibly Lord Mansfield â Blackstone became a Justice of the Common Pleas, succeeding Edward Clive, and was made a Serjeant-at-Law on 12 February. After only four days it was announced that Joseph Yates was to move to the Common Pleas, and Blackstone was again sworn in as a judge, this time of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. This was apparently due to Yates&#x27; poor health; Lord Mansfield ran a busy court as Lord Chief Justice, and it was felt that his transfer to the Common Pleas was for the best. Others commented that it was instead due to political and judicial disagreement, with Yates unwilling to stomach the changes which Mansfield made to English law. Blackstone sat regularly as a judge, despite bouts of ill health, and also served on various circuit courts. Prest describes him as an &quot;exceptionally careful, conscientious and well-respected judge ... his judgments ranging between narrowly framed technicalities [and] broad statements of public commentary&quot;. He was, however, considered a poor trial judge, being reversed on appeal more frequently than any of his peers.

Blackstone returned to the Common Pleas on 25 June 1770, having spent less than six months in the King&#x27;s Bench; Jeremy Bentham asserted that this was due to Mansfield&#x27;s having Blackstone removed similarly to his removal of Yates. Bentham asserted that in the King&#x27;s Bench, Blackstone was &quot;always in hot water&quot;, and that there was &quot;heartburning&quot; between the two; Bentham&#x27;s account is considered dubious because historically, Mansfield and Blackstone had an excellent relationship, with the third volume of the &quot;Commentaries&quot; describing Mansfield as &quot;a judge, whose masterly acquaintance with the law of nations was known and revered by every state in Europe&quot;. There is only one recorded King&#x27;s Bench case, &quot;R v Proprietors of Birmingham Canal Navigation&quot;, in which Blackstone and Mansfield disagreed.

In the Common Pleas, Blackstone operated under a civil jurisdiction rather than a mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, and many of his decisions are considered farsighted; the principle in &quot;Blaney v Hendricks&quot;, for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Blackstone&#x27;s decision in &quot;Goldswain&#x27;s Case&quot; was later repeated by Lord Denning in &quot;Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell&quot; in 1950.

==Death==
Blackstone had long suffered from gout, and by November 1779 also had a nervous disorder which caused dizziness, high blood pressure, and possibly diabetes. By 3 February 1780 he was too weak to write, and after &quot;some Days almost totally insensible&quot;, he died on 14 February at age 56. After a service conducted by Bishop Barrington on 22 February, Blackstone was buried in the family vault under St Peter&#x27;s Church, Wallingford. As his estate at his death was worth less than Â£15,000, William Eden secured a Â£400 annual royal pension for Sarah Blackstone. The initial reaction to Blackstone&#x27;s death was subdued, but in December 1780 the Fellows of All Souls College agreed that &quot;a Statue be erected to the memory of Sr W Blackstone deceased&quot;. Constructed by John Bacon, the life-sized statue of Blackstone in his judicial robes cost Â£539, and has rested in the Codrington Library (now the All Souls College Library) since 1872. His brother-in-law, James Clitherow, also published in 1781 two volumes of his law reports which added Â£1,287 to the estate, and in 1782 the &quot;Biographical History of Sir William Blackstone&quot; appeared.

==Legacy==

Blackstone&#x27;s primary legacy is his written work, specifically the &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;. In England and America the &quot;Commentaries&quot; became the basis of university legal education. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was &quot;almost inexhaustible&quot; in the 18th and 19th centuries, although the &quot;Commentaries&quot;&#x27; emphasis on the sovereignty of Parliament drew ire. Alexis de Tocqueville described Blackstone as &quot;an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment&quot;. Other commentators differ; one described him as &quot;the core element in the British Enlightenment&quot;, comparing him to Montesquieu, Beccaria and Voltaire. Academics have said that the &quot;Commentaries&quot; were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of substantive law. At the time of publication, the common law of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. The &quot;Commentaries&quot; helped to solidify legal thinking. At the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone&#x27;s work gave the Law &quot;at least a veneer of scholarly respectability&quot;. William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone&#x27;s successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that &quot;if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that [the United States], and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [common] law.&quot;

The &quot;Commentaries&quot; had a particular influence in the United States; James Iredell, an original Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States wrote that the &quot;Commentaries&quot; were &quot;Books admirably calculated for a young Student, and indeed may instruct the most learned ... Pleasure and Instruction go hand in hand.&quot; When the &quot;Commentaries&quot; were first printed in North America, 1,400 copies were ordered for Philadelphia alone. Academics have also noted the early reliance of the Supreme Court on the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, probably due to a lack of US legal tradition at that time. The US academic Robert Ferguson notes that &quot;all our formative documents â the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and the seminal decisions of the Supreme Court under John Marshall â were drafted by attorneys steeped in Sir William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;. So much was this the case that the &quot;Commentaries&quot; rank second only to the Bible as a literary and intellectual influence on the history of American institutions.&quot; Even towards the end of the twentieth century, the &quot;Commentaries&quot; were cited in Supreme Court decisions between 10 and 12 times a year.

Within United States academia and practise, as well as within the judiciary, the &quot;Commentaries&quot; had a substantial impact; with the scarcity of law books on the frontier, they were &quot;both the only law school and the only law library most American lawyers used to practise law in America for nearly a century after they were published.&quot; Blackstone had drawn up a plan for a dedicated School of Law, and submitted it to the University of Oxford; when the idea was rejected he included it in the &quot;Commentaries&quot;. It is from this plan that the modern system of American law schools comes. Subscribers to the first edition of Blackstone, and later readers who were profoundly influenced by it, include James Iredell, John Marshall, James Wilson, John Jay, John Adams, James Kent and Abraham Lincoln.

In the early 1920s the American Bar Association presented a statue of Blackstone to the English Bar Association; however, at the time, the sculpture was too tall to be placed in the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The sculpture, designed by Paul Wayland Bartlett was eventually cast in Europe and presented back to the US for display. Congress approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington, D.C., on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig, holding a copy of &quot;Commentaries&quot;. It is placed on a tall granite base and stands on Constitution Avenue and 3rd Street NW. The town of Blackstone, Virginia, is named after him.

The North Wall Frieze in the courtroom of the Supreme Court of the United States depicts William Blackstone, as one of the most influential legal commentators in world history.

===Blackstone&#x27;s Ratio or Blackstone&#x27;s Formulation===

Among the most well-known of Blackstone&#x27;s contributions to judicial theory is his own statement of the principle that it &quot;is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.&quot;

While this argument originates at least as far back as Genesis 18:23â32 in the Bible, as well as versions by Maimonides and Sir John Fortescue, Blackstone&#x27;s analysis is the one picked up by Benjamin Franklin and others, so that the term has become known as &quot;Blackstone&#x27;s Ratio&quot;.

As John Adams, having studied Blackstone, put it:

Blackstone&#x27;s Ratio is a maxim of English law, having been established as such within a few decades of Blackstone&#x27;s work being published. It is also cited in courts and law in the US, and is strongly emphasised to American law students.

=== Criticism ===
English jurist Jeremy Bentham was a critic of Blackstone&#x27;s theories. Others saw Blackstone&#x27;s theories as inaccurate statements of English law, using the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Tractatus of Glanville and the 1689 Bill of Rights as particularly obvious examples of laws Blackstone omitted.

<text>Kurt Vogel Russell (born March 17, 1951) is an American actor. At the age of 12, he began acting in the Western TV series &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot; (1963â1964). In the late 1960s, he signed a ten-year contract with The Walt Disney Company, where he starred as Dexter Riley in films such as &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot; (1969), &quot;Now You See Him, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot; (1975). For his portrayal of rock and roll superstar Elvis Presley in &quot;Elvis&quot; (1979), he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. According to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, Russell became the studio&#x27;s top star of the 1970s.

Russell was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor â Motion Picture for his performance in Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983). Also in the 1980s, he starred in several films directed by John Carpenter in which he played anti-hero roles: the futuristic action film &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), its sequel &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996), the horror film &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), and the kung-fu comedy action film &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; (1986).

He also portrayed Ego in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) installments &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017) and &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021), and played the role of Santa Claus in &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Christmas Chronicles 2&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Kurt Vogel Russell was born on March 17, 1951, at Wesson Maternity Hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts. His father, Bing Russell, was also an actor. His mother, Louise Julia () Russell, is a dancer. Russell is of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He has three sisters, Jill Franco, Jamie and Jody. His family relocated to California when he was a child, and Russell grew up in Thousand Oaks. Russell played little league baseball throughout his grade school years and also on his high school baseball team as a second baseman. He graduated from Thousand Oaks High School in California in 1969. His father played professional baseball. His sister Jill is the mother of baseball player Matt Franco. From 1969 to 1975, Russell served in the California Air National Guard and belonged to the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing, then based in Van Nuys.

==Career==
===Child actor===

Russell made his film debut with an uncredited part for &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, playing a boy who kicked a pilot (Elvis Presley) in the leg. On April 24, 1963, Russell guest-starred in the ABC series &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot;, starring Stanley Holloway as an English butler in an American family.

Later, he played the title role in the ABC Western series &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot; (1963â64). The show was based on Robert Lewis Taylor&#x27;s eponymous novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1959.

In 1964, Russell guest-starred in &quot;Nemesis&quot;, an episode of the ABC series &quot;The Fugitive&quot; in which, as the son of police Lt. Phillip Gerard, he is unintentionally kidnapped by his father&#x27;s quarry, Doctor Richard Kimble. In NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot;, he played the mistaken orphan whose father, played by Rory Calhoun, was an outlaw who was still alive and recently released from prison looking for his son.

Russell played a similar role as a kid named Packy Kerlin in the 1964 episode &quot;Blue Heaven&quot; for the Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. At age 13, Russell played the role of Jungle Boy on an episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which aired on February 6, 1965.

===Disney star===
In 1966, Russell was signed to a ten-year contract with Walt Disney Productions, where he became, according to Robert Osborne, the &quot;studio&#x27;s top star of the &#x27;70s&quot;. Russell&#x27;s first film for Disney was &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot; (1966). Walt Disney described Russell as &quot;a 15-year-old boy for whom I predict a great acting future&quot;, in what would prove to be Disney&#x27;s last filmed appearance before his death in December 1966. One of the last things Disney ever wrote was the name &quot;Kurt Russell&quot; (though misspelled as &quot;Kirt&quot;) on a piece of paper. In January 1967, Russell played Private Willie Prentiss in the episode &quot;Willie and the Yank: The Mosby Raiders&quot; in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;, released theatrically in some markets as &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Marauders&quot; (1967). During this time, Russell continued to guest star on non-Disney TV shows. He, Jay C. Flippen and Tom Tryon appeared in the episode &quot;Charade of Justice&quot; of the NBC Western series &quot;The Road West&quot; starring Barry Sullivan. In a March 1966 episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Space&quot; entitled &quot;The Challenge&quot;, he played Quano, the son of a planetary ruler.

While filming the Sherman Brothers musical &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; (1968), Russell met his future partner Goldie Hawn.

For Disney, he made &quot;The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1969) and &quot;Guns in the Heather&quot; (1969).

===Stardom===

Disney promoted Russell to star roles with &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot; (1969) which was a big hit. He followed it with &quot;The Barefoot Executive&quot; (1971), another success.

In 1971, he co-starred as a young robber released from jail, alongside James Stewart in &quot;Fools&#x27; Parade&quot;. Later, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Room 222&quot; as an idealistic high school student who assumed the costumed identity of Paul Revere to warn of the dangers of pollution.

However, the bulk of his film work was for Disney in films such as &quot;Now You See Him, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; (1971), &quot;Charley and the Angel&quot; (1973), and &quot;Superdad&quot; (1973).

====Baseball career====
Russell, like his father, had a baseball career. In the early 1970s, Russell was a switch-hitting second baseman for the California Angels minor league affiliates, the Bend Rainbows (1971) and Walla Walla Islanders (1972) in the short season Class A-Short Season Northwest League, then moved up to Class AA in 1973 with the El Paso Sun Kings of the Texas League.

While Russell was in the field turning the pivot of a double play early in the season, the incoming runner at second base collided with him and tore the rotator cuff in Russell&#x27;s right (throwing) shoulder. He did not return to El Paso, but was a designated hitter for the independent Portland Mavericks in the Northwest League late in their short season. The team was owned by his father, and he had been doing promotional work for them in the interim. The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973 and led to his return to acting.

====TV star====
In the autumn of 1974, he appeared in the ABC series &quot;The New Land&quot;, inspired by the 1972 Swedish film of the same name. Critically acclaimed, it suffered very low ratings and aired only six of the 13 episodes. He returned to Disney for &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot; (1975).

===Transition into Hollywood===
Russell was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Special for the 1979 television film &quot;Elvis&quot;, in which his then-wife Season Hubley played Priscilla. This would transition Russell&#x27;s Hollywood career after years as a child actor. It was directed by John Carpenter and led to a series of collaborations between the two men.

Russell starred in &quot;Amber Waves&quot; (1980) and the comedy &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980). He then played Snake Plissken in &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), directed by Carpenter.

He returned to Disney to provide the voice of Copper as an adult for &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981) then reunited with Carpenter for &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), based upon the short story &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; by John W. Campbell, Jr., which had been interpreted on film before, albeit loosely, in 1951&#x27;s &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;.

He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor â Motion Picture for his performance in &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983).

Russell made &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984) co-starring Goldie Hawn, who became his romantic partner. He starred in &quot;The Mean Season&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Best of Times&quot; (1986), then played an antihero truck driver caught in an ancient Chinese war in &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, another Carpenter film which, like &quot;The Thing,&quot; was initially a critical and commercial disappointment but has since gained a cult audience. More popular at the box office was &quot;Overboard&quot; (1987), a comedy with Goldie Hawn.

===1988âpresent===

Russell credited his performance in &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (1988) with getting Hollywood to regard him differently. He starred in &quot;Winter People&quot; (1989) and co-starred with Sylvester Stallone in &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989).

Russell played Lt. Stephen &quot;Bull&quot; McCaffrey in &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), Wyatt Earp in &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993) and Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neil in the military science fiction film &quot;Stargate&quot; (1994). He also had an uncredited role as the voice of Elvis Presley in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. His portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks in the 2004 film &quot;Miracle&quot;, won the praise of critics. &quot;In many ways&quot;, wrote Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;&quot;Miracle&quot; belongs to Kurt Russell.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Russell does real acting here.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Russell&#x27;s cagey and remote performance gives &quot;Miracle&quot; its few breezes of fresh air.&quot;

In 2006, Russell claimed in one interview that he had ghost-directed the hit 1993 Western film &quot;Tombstone&quot; on behalf of credited director George P. Cosmatos, saying he gave Cosmatos shot lists. Russell claimed Stallone recommended Cosmatos to him after the removal of the first director, writer Kevin Jarre, but Cosmatos had also worked with &quot;Tombstone&quot; executive producer Andrew G. Vajna before on &quot;&quot;. Russell said he promised Cosmatos he would keep it a secret as long as Cosmatos was alive; Cosmatos died in April 2005. Russell said he did not get a chance to edit his version, but Vajna gave him a tape of &quot;everything on the movie&quot; and that he might try to &quot;reconstruct the movie&quot;, although he would need to go back to the script and all his notes.

Russell played the villainous Stuntman Mike in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s segment &quot;Death Proof&quot; of the film &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007), and was in two more Tarantino films, &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015) and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019). He also had a major role in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;. After a remake of &quot;Escape from New York&quot; was announced, Russell was reportedly upset with Gerard Butler for playing his signature character, Snake Plissken, as he believed the character &#x27;was quintessentially [...] American.&#x27;

Russell appeared in &quot;The Battered Bastards of Baseball&quot;, a documentary about his father and the Portland Mavericks, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. He co-starred in the action thriller &quot;Furious 7&quot; in 2015. That same year, Russell garnered attention for his portrayal of Sheriff Franklin Hunt in the Western-horror film &quot;Bone Tomahawk&quot;.

On May 4, 2017, Russell and Goldie Hawn received stars in a double star ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their achievements in motion pictures, located at 6201 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Personal life==
Russell married actress Season Hubley, whom he met while filming &quot;Elvis&quot;, in 1979, and they had a son, Boston (born February 16, 1980). After his divorce from Hubley in 1983, Russell began his relationship with Goldie Hawn, and appeared alongside her in &quot;Swing Shift&quot; and &quot;Overboard&quot;, having previously appeared with her in &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; in 1968. They have a son, Wyatt Russell (born July 10, 1986), and have owned homes in Vancouver, British Columbia; Snowmass Village, Colorado; Manhattan, New York; Brentwood and Palm Desert, California. In an interview with &quot;People&quot; in December 2020, Russell revealed that he and Hawn never felt the need to marry, stating that a &quot;marriage certificate wasn&#x27;t going to create anything that otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t have.&quot;

Russell is a libertarian. In 2020, he stated that celebrities should keep their political opinions to themselves, believing that it negatively impacts their work.

Russell is a hunter and a staunch supporter of gun rights, and said that gun control will not reduce terrorism. He is also an FAA-licensed private pilot holding single/multi-engine and instrument ratings, and is an Honorary Council Member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope. In 2010, he was inducted as part of the Living Legends of Aviation, receiving the &quot;Aviation Mentor Award&quot; from fellow actor-pilot John Travolta.

In February 2003, Russell and Hawn moved to Vancouver so that their son could play hockey.

<text>The British threepence piece, usually simply known as a threepence, thruppence, or thruppenny bit, was a denomination of sterling coinage worth of one pound or of one shilling. It was used in the United Kingdom, and earlier in Great Britain and England. Similar denominations were later used throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth countries, notably in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

The sum of three pence was pronounced variously , or , reflecting different pronunciations in the various regions of the United Kingdom. The coin was often referred to in conversation as a , or bit. Before Decimal Day in 1971, sterling used the Carolingian monetary system, under which the largest unit was a pound divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. The brass threepence coin was withdrawn in 1971 due to decimalisation and replaced by the decimal new penny, with 2.4&quot;d&quot; being worth 1p.

==Early threepences==

The three-pence (3d) coin first appeared in England during the &quot;fine silver&quot; coinage of King Edward VI (1547â53), when it formed part of a set of new denominations. Although it was an easy denomination to work with in the context of the old sterling coinage system, being a quarter of a shilling, initially it was not popular with the public who preferred the groat (four pence).

Edward VI threepences were struck at the London and York mints. The obverse shows a front-facing bust of the king, with a rose to the left and the value numeral III to the right, surrounded by the legend . The reverse shows a long cross over the royal shield, surrounded by the legend (London mint) (&quot;I have made God my helper&quot;), or (York mint) (&quot;City of York&quot;).

Queen Elizabeth I (1558â1603) produced threepences during her third coinage (1561â1577). Most 1561 issues are 21Â mm in diameter, while later ones are 19Â mm in diameter. These coins are identifiable from other denominations by the rose behind the queen&#x27;s head on the obverse, and the date on the reverse. The obverse shows a left-facing crowned bust of the queen with a rose behind her, surrounded by the legend , while the reverse shows shield over a long cross, dated 1561, surrounded by the legend . Dates used for the smaller coins were 1561â77. Threepences of the fourth coinage (1578â1582) are identical except for having a slightly lower silver content. There was also a fairly rare milled coinage threepence, produced between 1561 and 1564 with similar designs and inscriptions to the hammered coinage threepences.

The threepence denomination fell out of use again during the reign of King James I, while during King Charles I&#x27;s reign (1625â49) it was not produced at the London Tower mint, but was produced (sometimes in some quantity) at various provincial mints. The denomination is identified by the numeral III appearing behind the king&#x27;s head.

==Threepences reintroduced==

By far the most common Charles I threepences were produced at the Aberystwyth mint between 1638 and 1642. They feature a left-facing crowned bust of the king with plumes in front of his face and the numeral III behind him, with the legend (or a combination of M(A) B F(R) ET H(I)(B) depending on the engraver), with the reverse showing the royal arms on a large oval shield with plumes above the shield, and the legend Â â &quot;I reign under the auspices of Christ&quot;. Plumes were the identifying symbol of the Aberystwyth mint, but the Bristol and Oxford mints often used dies from the Aberystwyth mint so plumes often appear on their output too. Milled coins were produced at the York mint between 1638 and 1649, which look similar to the Aberystwyth product but without the plumesÂ â the obverse features a left-facing crowned bust of the king with the numeral III behind him, with the legend , with the reverse showing the royal arms on a shield over a cross, with over the shield and the legend .

Coins were produced at the Oxford mint between 1644 and 1646, using the Aberystwyth dies for the obverse, while the reverse of the 1644 coin shows the Declaration of Oxford in three lines: Â â &quot;The religion of the Protestants, the laws of England, the liberty of Parliament. 1644 Oxford&quot;, while around the outside of the coin is the legend Â â &quot;Let God arise and His enemies be scattered&quot;. This coin also appears dated 1646. A further type produced at Oxford had on the obverse the king&#x27;s bust with the denomination behind him, and the letter &quot;R&quot; (for Rawlins, the maker of the die) below the king&#x27;s shoulder and the legend and the Aberystwyth reverse.

==Rarer threepences==
The mint at Bristol produced rare threepences in 1644 and 1645. In 1644 the Aberystwyth obverse was used to produce a coin with the reverse showing the Declaration of Oxford: Â â &quot;The religion of the Protestants, the laws of England, the liberty of Parliament 1644&quot;, while around the outside of the coin is the legend Â â &quot;Let God arise and His enemies be scattered&quot;. This was repeated in 1645, but with a plumelet instead of a plume in front of the king&#x27;s face.

In 1644 the Exeter mint produced a fairly scarce threepence. It features a left-facing crowned bust of the king with the numeral III behind him, with the legend , with the reverse showing the royal arms on a shield with the date 1644 above the shield, and the legend .

No threepences were produced by the Commonwealth of England.

A quantity of (370,000) silver threepences were struck dated 1945, although these were all melted with the metal used in other mint products. However, it is believed a handful escaped, with one example selling for Â£62,000 at auction in 2020.

==Mid-to-late 17th century==
The final hammered coinage threepences were produced at the start of the reign of King Charles II. In style they are very reminiscent of his father&#x27;s issues, the obverse featuring the bust of the king, with the numeral III and the legend , with the reverse showing the royal arms on a shield over a cross, and the legend .

The milled silver threepences of Charles II form two types. There is the undated issue which looks very like the earlier hammered coinage, with a crowned left-facing bust of the king with the denomination indicated by III behind his head, and the inscription , with the reverse showing a shield encircling the arms of England, Scotland, Ireland and France with the legend . This was followed by the dated issue, issued each year from 1670 to 1684, where the obverse features a right-facing uncrowned bust of the king and the inscription , with the reverse showing three crowned interlinked &quot;C&quot;s (indicating the value) and the inscription . All milled silver threepences were 17 millimetres in diameter and weighed 1.5 gramsÂ â dimensions which were unchanged until near the end of the reign of George III.

A similar threepence was produced for King James II, dated 1685 to 1688, the obverse showing a left-facing bust of the king and the inscription , with the reverse showing three crowned &quot;I&quot;s (indicating the value) and the inscription .

For the joint reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, threepences were produced in all years from 1689 to 1694. For the first two years a somewhat caricatured portrait of the monarchs was used, replaced by a rather more staid portrait in 1691, with the inscription , while the reverse shows a crowned Arabic number &quot;3&quot; and the inscription . For the sole reign of William III, the design remained very similar, with the inscriptions changed to and .

==Early 18th century==
In the reign of Queen Anne (1702â1714), the same basic design was used, with threepences produced in 1703â10 and 1713. The obverse shows a left-facing bust of the Queen, with the inscription while the reverse shows the crowned &quot;3&quot; and (1703â05, 1707), (1706), or (1708â13).

The design continued in the reign of King George I, when threepences were produced in 1717, 1721, 1723, and 1727. The obverse shows a right-facing bust of the King, with the inscription while the reverse shows the crowned &quot;3&quot; and .

Unusually, the same young portrait of King George II was used on the threepence throughout his reign (1727â60), despite an older portrait being used on other denominations from 1743. Threepences were produced in 1729, 1731, 1732, 1735, 1737, 1739, 1740, 1743, 1746, and 1760. The obverse shows a left-facing bust of the King, with the inscription while the reverse shows the crowned &quot;3&quot; and .

==Change of role==
While the silver threepence was minted as a currency coin until nearly the middle of the 20th century, it is clear that the purpose of the coin changed during the reign of King George III (1760â1820). In the first two years of minting, 1762 and 1763, the coin was obviously produced for general circulation as examples are generally found well worn; on the other hand, coins from the late issue (1817â20) are usually found in very fine condition, indicating that they were probably issued as Maundy money. Over the length of the reign there were several different designs of obverse and reverse in use. Threepences were issued in 1762â63, 1765â66, 1770, 1772, 1780, 1784, 1786, 1792, 1795, 1800, 1817, 1818, and 1820. From 1817 the dimensions of the coin were reduced to a weight of 1.4Â grams (defined as Â troy ounce) and diameter of 16 millimetres, following the Great Recoinage of 1816. The inscription on the obverse reads up to 1800, and from 1817. The reverse inscription reads up to 1800 and from 1817.

By the start of the reign of King George IV (1820â30) the coin was being struck primarily as a Maundy coin, although some coins were produced for use in the colonies. See Maundy money for full details of these issues. Threepences were struck in all years from 1822 to 1830, though the king&#x27;s head is smaller on the 1822 issue, apparently because the correct punch broke and the one from the twopence was used instead. The obverse inscription reads , while the reverse shows a new-style crowned &quot;3&quot; and date, all within a wreath.

In King William IV&#x27;s reign (1830â37), maundy coins were produced in 1831â37, and identical circulation coins were produced for the colonies, identifiable only through not having a prooflike surface. The obverse inscription reads , while the reverse shows the new-style crowned &quot;3&quot; and date, all within a wreath.

==Queen Victoria==

During the reign of Queen Victoria, threepences were produced both for Maundy use and for normal circulation in all years between 1838 and 1901 except 1847, 1848, and 1852 (perhaps because of the proposal for a decimal currency at the time (see florin); the 3d at pound would not have fitted within a decimal system). Currency silver threepences from 1838 to 1926 were of identical design and cannot usually be distinguished except in the best conditions when the higher striking standard of the Maundy coins stands out; when the currency was decimalised in 1971, &quot;all&quot; silver threepences from 1870 onwards were revalued at three new pence, not just the Maundy coins. Threepences were produced both with the &quot;young head&quot; (1838â87) and with the &quot;Jubilee head&quot; (1887â93), inscribed , while those produced with the &quot;old head&quot; (1893â1901) are inscribed .

==Early 20th century==
The currency threepence was issued for each of the nine years of the reign of King Edward VII from 1902. The reverse design remained the same, while the obverse showed the right-facing effigy of the king, with the inscription .

The reign of King George V (1910â1936) features several changes to the threepence denomination. As with all British silver coins, the silver content was reduced from sterling (0.925) silver to 50% silver, 40% copper, 10% nickel in 1920, 50% silver, 50% copper in 1922, and 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, 5% zinc in 1927, while the design of the reverse of the circulating threepence (but not the maundy threepence) was completely changed in 1927 to three oak sprigs with three acorns and a &quot;G&quot; in the centre, and the inscription . The inscription on the obverse throughout the reign was .

The threepences of King Edward VIII were all patterns awaiting royal approval at the time of the abdication in December 1936. The silver threepence had another completely new reverseÂ â three interlinked rings of Saint Edmund, with the inscription , while the obverse shows a left-facing effigy of the king with the inscription and a very small silver engravement.

==Brass vs silver threepences==
By the end of George V&#x27;s reign the threepence had become unpopular in England because of its small size (George Orwell comments on this in &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;), but it remained popular in Scotland. It was consequently decided to introduce a more substantial threepenny coin which would have a more convenient weight/value ratio than the silver coinage. The silver threepence continued to be minted, as there may have been some uncertainty about how well the new coin would be accepted. The reign of Edward VIII saw the planned introduction of a new, larger, nickel-brass (79% copper, 20% zinc, 1% nickel) twelve-sided brass threepence coin. This coin weighed and the diameter was across the sides and across the corners. The obverse shows a left-facing effigy of the king (not right as would have been the convention to alternate the direction) with the inscription , and the reverse shows a three-headed thrift plant with the inscription . A total of just 12 of these coins were struck for experimental purposes and sent to a slot machine manufacturing company for testing. The whereabouts of six of those 12 are known. However, the other six are still out there somewhere and, as such, they are extremely rare today. An example was put up for auction in 2013, expecting Â£30,000. There are two types of Edward VIII brass threepences. The first type has the date broken by a thrift plant design and the second has the date below.

During the reign of King George VI, circulation silver threepences were produced only in 1937â45 (and almost all the 1945 examples were subsequently melted down). The obverse shows a left-facing effigy of the king with the inscription , while the reverse has an elegant design of a shield of St George lying on a Tudor rose, dividing the date, with the inscription . The nickel-brass threepence took over the bulk of the production of the denomination, being produced in all years between 1937 and 1952 except 1947. Apart from the king&#x27;s head and name, and the weight being increased to , the coin was identical to that prepared for Edward VIII. Coins dated 1946 and 1949 were minted in far fewer numbers than the rest, and as nickel-brass wears very quickly; higher grade specimens of these coins are expensive to buy now (both over Â£500 for uncirculated examples). The scarce dates are 1948, 1950 and 1951 and these are now selling for Â£60âÂ£80 in mint state.

==Elizabeth II threepences==
The physical dimensions of the brass threepence remained the same in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. The effigy of the queen produced by Mary Gillick was used, with the inscription used in 1953, and used in all other years. The reverse shows a Tudor portcullis with chains and a coronet, with the inscription . This coin was produced in all years from 1953 to 1967, and in 1970 (in proof sets only).

Following decimalisation, the brass threepence ceased to be legal tender after 31 August 1971.

==The Commonwealth==
A three pence coin was also used in the pre-decimalisation currencies of Commonwealth of Nations countries such as Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand. It was called a tickey in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.

==Building==
No. 1 Croydon was known for many years as the &quot;threepenny bit building&quot; for its resemblance to a stack of threepenny coins. After the coins were phased out (beginning in 1970) the building eventually gained a new nickname, the &quot;50p building&quot;.

==Nickname==
The silver threepenny bit became known as a &#x27;joey&#x27;. However, the original &#x27;joey&#x27; was the groat (or fourpence).The groat was re-introduced in 1836 during the reign of William IV at the suggestion of Joseph Hume (1777-1855). Popularly known as the &#x27;joey&#x27;, named after Hume&#x27;s christian name, it was introduced to ease transactions on the London buses, the fare being four pence or one groat. As the last groats were struck in 1888 the nickname passed to the silver threepences struck after that date until 1941 (the last year of production for British use). The silver threepence continued to be struck for three further years from 1942 to 1944 inclusive although for colonial use only as the 12-sided brass threepences were being struck in large numbers.

==The 12-sided coin reprised==
In March 2014, the Royal Mint announced that a new design of one pound coin would be introduced in 2017, reprising the twelve-sided shape. The new coin was designed to be more difficult to counterfeit.

==October 2019 â sale of 120,000 threepences==

In October 2019, it was announced that 120,000 silver threepences dated to 1935 and earlier were to be sold to the general public, as part of a move to encourage people to pick up coin collecting and numismatics. The London Mint Office oversaw the sale of the coins, which all date from George V&#x27;s reign and were valued at a total of approximately Â£1m, although a more realistic valuation would be in the region of Â£60,000.

<text>The Pianist is a 1991 film directed by Claude Gagnon. It is based on the novel &quot;A Certain Mr. Takahashi&quot; by Ann Ireland. The central premise of the film - in which two teenage girls develop a crush on, and begin stalking, a celebrated concert pianist - is very similar to the 1964 film &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot;.

==Plot==
A newly arrived celebrated Japanese pianist Takahashi (Eiji Okuda) is spied on by two teenage neighbor sisters, Jean (Gail Travers) and Colette (Macha Grenon). A family reunion to announce that the parents will be managing an institution in China recalls their experiences in attempting to meet him, then interacting with him in a supposedly one time sexual experience â a mÃ©nage Ã  trois. The father of the sisters imitates Colette is unaware that Jean has seen her at a New York City night club dancing with him. Colette visited Jean in New York City and makes explorations of the city on her own. Takahashi is to sign posters at an event in Vancouver where the parents of the sisters have relocated. Colette does not want to go to the signing on the reasoning that they all have changed. Colette comes clean that she has slept with him and does not want him to know that she is aware of their . A former boyfriend of the sister&#x27;s mother attends the reunion, and Jean has a tryst with him during the banquet. They go to the poster signing, are welcomed by him and invited to lunch. Following the lunch, he makes his goodbyes to the sisters and Colette indicates to him that they are still friends. His limousine drives away.

<text>The Pianist (&quot;El Pianista&quot;) was a 1998 Catalan-language film directed by Mario Gas, and based on a novel by Manuel VÃ¡zquez MontalbÃ¡n. It tells the story of two musicians, played in their old age by Serge Reggiani and Laurent Terzieff and in their youth by Pere Ponce and Jordi MollÃ , who were friends at the onset of the Spanish Civil War. They meet 60 years later, and the movie shows the strikingly different paths which they took in the circumstances of the war.

<text>The Pianist is a memoir by the Polish-Jewish pianist and composer WÅadysÅaw Szpilman in which he describes his life in Warsaw in occupied Poland during World War II. After being forced with his family to live in the Warsaw Ghetto, Szpilman manages to avoid deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp, and from his hiding places around the city witnesses the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and the Warsaw Uprising (the rebellion by the Polish resistance) the following year. He survives in the ruined city with the help of friends and strangers, including Wilm Hosenfeld, a German army captain who admires his piano playing.

The book was first published in Polish in 1946 as &quot;ÅmierÄ Miasta. PamiÄtniki WÅadysÅawa Szpilmana 1939â1945&quot; (&quot;Death of a City: Memoirs of WÅadysÅaw Szpilman 1939â1945&quot;), edited by Jerzy Waldorff, a Polish music critic and friend of Szpilman&#x27;s. In his introduction, Waldorff explained that he had written down the story as told by Szpilman. A 1950 Polish film based on the book was heavily censored by the Communist government.

A German translation by Karin Wolff in 1998, &quot;Das wunderbare Ãberleben: Warschauer Erinnerungen&quot; (&quot;The Miraculous Survival: Warsaw Memories&quot;), named WÅadysÅaw Szpilman as the sole author, and in 1999 an English translation by Anthea Bell was published as &quot;The Pianist: The Extraordinary Story of One Man&#x27;s Survival in Warsaw, 1939â45&quot;. Two years after Szpilman&#x27;s death, Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002) won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and the following year it won three Academy Awards (Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Director), and BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Best Direction.

==Synopsis==
===WÅadysÅaw Szpilman===
WÅadysÅaw Szpilman (1911â2000) was born in Sosnowiec, Poland, and studied piano in the early 1930s at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw and at the Berlin Academy of Arts. In Berlin he was instructed by Leonid Kreutzer and Artur Schnabel. During his time at the academy he also studied composition with Franz Schreker.

In 1933, after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, Szpilman returned to Warsaw, where he worked as a pianist for Polish Radio. During the invasion of Poland in September 1939, German bombs destroyed the power station that kept Polish Radio running. Szpilman played the station&#x27;s last pre-war live recording (a Chopin recital) on 23 September 1939, the day it went off the air.

Days after Warsaw&#x27;s surrender, German leaflets were hung on the walls of buildings, promising Poles the protection of the German state. A section of the leaflets were devoted to Jews, guaranteeing that their rights, property and lives would be secure. Decrees applying to Jews were posted around the city. From 1 December Jews over the age of 12 had to wear a blue Star of David on a white armband; they were given five days to comply. They had to hand real estate and valuables over to German officials. Jewish families were permitted to own just 2,000 zlotys; the rest had to be deposited in a bank in a blocked account. Very few people complied. Szpilman&#x27;s familyâhe was living with his parents, his brother Henryk, and his sisters Regina and Halinaâhid their money in the window frame, an expensive gold watch under a cupboard, and the watch&#x27;s chain beneath the fingerboard of Szpilman&#x27;s father&#x27;s violin.

===Creation of the ghetto===

By 1940 many of the roads leading to the area set aside for the Warsaw ghetto were being blocked off with walls. No reason was given for the construction work. Notices appeared in the streets that were to mark the ghetto&#x27;s boundary announcing that the area was infected by typhus. Szpilman describes a newspaper article that appeared soon after the ghetto was announced:

[T]he only Warsaw newspaper published in Polish by the Germans provided an official comment on this subject: not only were the Jews social parasites, they also spread infection. They were not, said the report, to be shut up in a ghetto; even the word ghetto was not to be used. The Germans were too cultured and magnanimous a race, said the newspaper, to confine even parasites like the Jews to ghettos, a medieval remnant unworthy of the new order in Europe. Instead, there was to be a separate Jewish quarter of the city where only Jews lived, where they would enjoy total freedom, and where they could continue to practise their racial customs and culture. Purely for hygienic reasons, this quarter was to be surrounded by a wall so that typhus and other Jewish diseases could not spread to other parts of the city.

Szpilman&#x27;s family was already living in the ghetto-designated area; other families had to find new homes within its confines. They were given just over a month&#x27;s warning, and many had to pay exorbitant rents for tiny slums in bad areas. (By May 1941, 445,000 Jews were living in the ghetto, which covered 4.5 percent of the city&#x27;s area.)

===Life in the ghetto===
By the time the Germans closed the gates of the ghetto on 15 November 1940, Szpilman&#x27;s family had sold all their belongings, including their &quot;most precious household possession&quot;, the piano. Szpilman found he was able to earn a living by playing piano, first in the ghetto&#x27;s CafÃ© Nowoczesna in Nowolipki Street, then in a cafÃ© in Sienna Street frequented by the Jewish intelligentsia, and later in the ghetto&#x27;s largest cafÃ©, the Sztuka in Leszno Street.
The CafÃ© Nowoczesna pandered to the ghetto&#x27;s upper class, largely smugglers and their guests. The closure of the ghetto had made little difference to the trade. Food, drink and luxury goods arrived heaped on wagons; Kon and Heller, who ran the business (both in the service of the Gestapo), paid the guards to turn a blind eye. There were other, less organized, forms of smuggling too. Every afternoon carts would pass by the ghetto wall, a whistle would be heard, and bags of food would be thrown over the wall. Several smugglers were children who squeezed through the gutters that ran from the Aryan to the Jewish side. Szpilman describes watching such an operation in progress; the goods had been thrown over, and the child was about to follow:

His skinny little figure was already partly in view when he suddenly began screaming, and at the same time I heard the hoarse bellowing of a German on the other side of the wall. I ran to the child to help him squeeze through as quickly as possible, but in defiance of our efforts his hips stuck in the drain. I pulled at his little arms with all my might, while his screams became increasingly desperate, and I could hear the heavy blows struck by the policeman on the other side of the wall. When I finally managed to pull the child through, he died. His spine had been shattered.

As time went on, the ghetto slowly split into a small ghetto, made up of the intelligentsia and middle and upper classes, and a large one that held the rest of the Warsaw Jews. The two were connected by a crossing on ChÅodna Street. Szpilman and his family lived in the small ghetto, which was less crowded and dangerous. Whenever he went into the large ghetto, he would visit a friend, Jehuda Zyskind, who worked as a smuggler, trader, driver or carrier as the need arose. Zyskind would supply Szpilman with the latest news from outside the ghetto, which he received via radio. In the winter of 1942, Zyskind and his family were shot after being caught producing underground publications.

After completing whatever other business he had, Szpilman would head back to his house in the small ghetto. On his way he would meet up with his brother, Henryk, who made a living trading books in the street. Henryk, like WÅadysÅaw, was cultured and well educated. Many of his friends advised him to do as most young men of the intelligentsia and join the Jewish Ghetto Police, an organization of Jews who worked under the SS, upholding their laws in the ghetto. Henryk refused to work with &quot;bandits&quot;. In May 1942 the Jewish police began to carry out the task of &quot;human hunting&quot; for the Germans:
You could have said, perhaps, that they caught the Gestapo spirit. As soon as they put on their uniforms and police caps and picked up their rubber truncheons, their natures changed. Now their ultimate ambition was to be in close touch with the Gestapo, to be useful to Gestapo officers, parade down the street with them, show off their knowledge of the German language and vie with their masters in the harshness of their dealings with the Jewish population.

During a &quot;human hunt&quot; conducted by the Jewish police, Henryk was picked up and arrested. Szpilman went to the labour bureau building, hoping that his popularity as a pianist would be enough to secure Henryk&#x27;s release and stop himself from being arrested as well, for none of his papers were in order. After much effort, he managed to extract a promise from the deputy director of the labour bureau that Henryk would be home by that night. The other men arrested during the sweep were taken to Treblinka.

===&quot;Umschlagplatz&quot;===
The deportations began on 22 July 1942. Buildings, randomly selected from all areas of the ghetto, were surrounded by German officers leading troops of Jewish police. The inhabitants were called out and the buildings searched, then everyone was loaded into wagons and taken to the Umschlagplatz (assembly area) in Stawki Street next to the Warszawa GdaÅska station. From there, they were loaded onto trains. Notices posted around the city said that all Jews fit to work were going to the East to work in German factories. They would each be allowed 20 kilograms of luggage, jewelry, and provisions for two days. Only Jewish officials from the JudenrÃ¤te or other social institutions were exempt from resettlement.

In the hope of being allowed to stay in Warsaw if they were useful to the German community, Jews tried to find work at German firms that were recruiting within the ghetto. If they managed to find work, often by paying their employer to hire them, Jews would be issued with certificates of employment. They would pin notices bearing the name of the place where they were working onto their clothing.

After six days searching and deal making, Szpilman managed to procure six work certificates, enough for his entire family. At this time, Henryk, WÅadysÅaw and their father were given work sorting the stolen possessions of Jewish families at the collection centre near the Umschlagplatz. They and the rest of the family were allowed to move into the barracks for Jewish workers at the centre. On 16 August 1942, their luck ran out. A selection was carried out at the collection centre, and only Henryk and Halina passed as fit to work. The rest of the family was taken to the &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot;. Henryk and Halina, working in the collection centre, heard about the family&#x27;s plight and volunteered to go there too. Szpilman was horrified by his siblings&#x27; headstrong decision, and only accepted their presence after his appeal to the guards had failed to secure their release. The family sat together in the large open space:
At one point a boy made his way through the crowd in our direction with a box of sweets on a string round his neck. He was selling them at ridiculous prices, although heaven knows what he thought he was going to do with the money. Scraping together the last of our small change, we bought a single cream caramel. Father divided it into six parts with his penknife. That was our last meal together.

By six o&#x27;clock that night, the first wagons were full. There was a strong smell of chlorine. The SS were pushing people with their rifle butts, and those already inside were crying and shouting. Szpilman had walked halfway down the train with his family when he heard someone shout his name: &quot;Here! Here, Szpilman!&quot; Someone grabbed him by the collar, and he was pulled out of the police cordon. Szpilman never saw his family again. The train took them to the Treblinka extermination camp, and none survived the war.

===Death of a city===

Szpilman got work to keep himself safe. His first job was demolishing the walls of the large ghetto; now that most of the Jews had been deported, it was being reclaimed. While doing this, Szpilman was allowed to go to the Gentile side of Warsaw. When they could slip away, he and the other workers visited Polish food stalls and bought potatoes and bread. By eating some of the food and selling or trading the rest in the ghetto (where the value skyrocketed), the workers could feed themselves and raise enough money to repeat the exercise the next day.

Szpilman survived another selection and was sent to other jobs. Eventually, he was posted to a steady job as &quot;storeroom manager&quot;, where he organized the stores at the SS accommodation. At around this time, the Germans in charge of Szpilman&#x27;s group decided to allow each man five kilograms of potatoes and a loaf of bread every day, to make them feel more secure under the Germans; fears of deportation had been running at high levels since the last selection. To get this food, the men were allowed to choose a representative to go into the city with a cart every day and buy it. They chose a young man known as &quot;Majorek&quot; (Little Major). Majorek acted not only to collect food, but as a link between the Jewish resistance in the ghetto and similar groups outside. Hidden inside his bags of food every day, Majorek would bring weapons and ammunition into the ghetto to be passed to the resistance by Szpilman and the other workers. Majorek was also a link to Szpilman&#x27;s Polish friends on the outside; through Majorek, Szpilman managed to arrange his escape from the ghetto.

On 13 February 1943, Szpilman slipped through the ghetto gate and met up with his friend Andrzej Bogucki on the other side. As soon as he saw Szpilman coming, Bogucki turned away and began to walk towards the hiding place they had arranged for him. Szpilman followed, careful not to reveal himself as Jewish by straying into the light of a street lamp while a German was passing.

Szpilman only stayed in his first hiding place for a few days before he moved on. While hiding in the city, he had to move many times from flat to flat. Each time he would be provided with food by friends involved in the Polish resistance who, with one or two exceptions, came irregularly but as often as they were able. These months were long and boring for Szpilman; he passed his time by learning to cook elaborate meals silently and out of virtually nothing, by reading, and by teaching himself English. During the entire period he lived in fear of capture by the Germans. If he were ever discovered and unable to escape, Szpilman planned to commit suicide so that he would be unable to compromise any of his helpers under questioning. During the months spent in hiding, he came extremely close to suicide on several occasions.

===Warsaw uprising===

Szpilman continued to live in his hiding places until August 1944. That month, just weeks after the first Soviet shells had fallen on the city, the Warsaw uprising began, the Polish Home Army&#x27;s effort to fight the German occupiers. As a result of the Soviet attack, the Germans had begun evacuating the civilian population, but there was still a strong military presence in Warsaw. This was the target of the Warsaw rebellion.

From the window of the fourth-floor flat in which he was hiding, Szpilman had a good vantage point from which to watch. Hiding in a predominantly German area, he was not in a good position to join the fightingâhe would need to get past several units of German soldiers who were holding the areaâso he stayed in his building. On 12 August 1944, the German search for those behind the rebellion reached Szpilman&#x27;s building. It was surrounded by Ukrainian fascists and the inhabitants were ordered to evacuate before the building was destroyed. A tank fired a couple of shots into the building, then it was set alight.

Szpilman could only hope that the flats on the first floor were the only ones burning, and that he would escape the flames by staying high. But within hours, his room filled with smoke, and he began to feel the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. He was resigned to dying, and decided to commit suicide by swallowing sleeping pills followed by a bottle of opium. But as soon as he took the sleeping pills, which acted almost instantly on his empty stomach, he fell asleep.

When he woke up, the fire was no longer burning as powerfully. All the floors below Szpilman&#x27;s were burned out to varying degrees, and he left the building to escape the smoke that filled the rooms. He sat down just outside the building, leaning against a wall to conceal himself from the Germans on the road on the other side. He remained hidden until dark, then he struck out across the road to an unfinished hospital building that had been evacuated. He crossed the road on hands and knees, lying flat and pretending to be a corpse (of which there were many on the road) whenever a German unit came into sight. When he eventually reached the hospital, he collapsed on the floor and fell asleep.
The next day Szpilman explored the hospital thoroughly. It was full of items the Germans intended to take with them, meaning he would have to be careful travelling around the building in case a group should arrive to loot. To avoid the patrols that occasionally swept the building, Szpilman hid in a lumber room, tucked in a remote corner of the hospital. Food and drink were scarce in the hospital, and for the first four or five days of his stay in the building, Szpilman was unable to find anything. When, again, he went searching for food and drink, Szpilman managed to find some crusts of bread and a fire bucket full of water. The stinking water was covered in an iridescent film, but Szpilman drank deeply, although he stopped after inadvertently swallowing a considerable amount of dead insects.

On 30 August Szpilman moved back into his old building, which by now had entirely burnt out. Here, in larders and bathtubs (now open to the air because of the fire), Szpilman found bread and rainwater, which kept him alive. During his time in this building the Warsaw uprising was defeated and the evacuation of the civilian population was completed. The Polish Home Army signed the capitulation agreement on 2 October 1944; 200,000 civilians are thought to have died. By October 14 Szpilman and the German army were all but the only humans still living in Warsaw, which had been completely destroyed by the Germans:

[The city] now consisted of the chimneys of burnt-out buildings pointing to the sky, and whatever walls the bombing had spared: a city of rubble and ashes under which the centuries-old culture of my people and the bodies of hundreds of thousands of murdered victims lay buried, rotting in the warmth of these late autumn days and filling the air with a dreadful stench.

As November set in, so did winter. Living in the attic of the block of flats, with very little protection from the cold and the snow, Szpilman began to get extremely cold. As a result of the cold and the squalor, he eventually developed an insatiable craving for hot porridge. So, at great risk, Szpilman came down from the attic to find a working oven in one of the flats. He was still trying to get the stove lit when he was discovered by a German soldier:

From then on, Szpilman decided to stay hidden on the roof, coming down only at dusk to search for food. He was soon forced to change his plans. Lying on the roof one day, he suddenly heard a burst of gunfire; two Germans were standing on the roof shooting at him. Szpilman slithered through the trapdoor onto the stairway, and down into the expanse of burnt-out buildings.

===Wilm Hosenfeld===
Szpilman soon found a similar building that he could live in. It was the only multi-story building in the area and, as was now his custom, he made his way up to the attic. Days later, while raiding one of its kitchens, he suddenly heard a German voice ask what he was doing. Szpilman said nothing, but sat down in despair by the larder door. The German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, asked for his occupation, and Szpilman replied that he was a pianist. Hosenfeld led him to a piano in the next room and instructed him to play:


Hosenfeld went with Szpilman to take a look at his hiding place. Inspecting the attic thoroughly, he found a loft above the attic that Szpilman hadn&#x27;t noticed. He helped Szpilman find a ladder and climb up into the loft. From then until his unit retreated from Warsaw, he supplied Szpilman with food, water and encouraging news of the Soviet advance. Hosenfeld&#x27;s unit left during the first half of December 1944. He left Szpilman with supplies and a German army greatcoat. Szpilman had little to offer by way of thanks, but told him that if he should ever need help, he should ask for the pianist Szpilman of the Polish Radio.

The Soviets finally arrived on 17 January 1945. When the city was liberated, troops began to arrive, with civilians following them, alone or in small groups. Wishing to be friendly, Szpilman came out of his hiding place and greeted one of these civilians, a woman carrying a bundle on her back. Before he had finished speaking, she dropped her bundle, turned and fled, shouting that Szpilman was &quot;a German!&quot; He ran back inside his building. Minutes later, the building was surrounded by troops who were making their way in via the cellars. Szpilman came down the stairs slowly, shouting &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot! I&#x27;m Polish!&quot; A young Polish officer came up the stairs towards him, pointing his pistol and telling him to put his hands up. The officer inspected him closely; he eventually agreed that Szpilman was Polish and lowered the pistol.

==Career after the war, last years and death==
Szpilman resumed his musical career at Radio Poland in Warsaw, in 1945. His first piece at the newly reconstructed recording room of Radio Warsaw, Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne in C sharp minor, was the last piece he had played six years before.

A violinist friend, Zygmunt Lednicki, told Szpilman about a German officer he had met at a Soviet POW camp. The officer, learning that Lednicki was a musician, had asked if he knew WÅadysÅaw Szpilman. Lednicki had said that he did, but before the German could tell him his name, the guards at the camp had asked Lednicki to move on and sat the German back down again. When Szpilman and Lednicki returned to where the camp had been, it was gone. Szpilman did everything in his power to find the officer, but it took him five years even to discover his name. After much soul searching, Szpilman sought the intercession of a man whom he privately considered &quot;a bastard&quot;, Jakub Berman, the head of the Polish secret police. Several days later, Berman paid a visit to Szpilman&#x27;s home and said that there was nothing he could do. He added, &quot;If your German were still in Poland, then we could get him out. But our comrades in the Soviet Union won&#x27;t let him go. They say your officer belonged to a detachment involved in spying â so there is nothing we can do about it as Poles, and I am powerless&quot; Hosenfeld died in captivity in 1952. He was recognized by Israel as Righteous Among the Nations in 2008.

Szpilman went on to become the head of Polish Radio&#x27;s music department until 1963, when he retired to devote more time to composing and touring as a concert pianist. In 1986 he retired from the latter and became a full-time composer. Szpilman died in Warsaw on 6 July 2000, aged 88.

==Publication history==
===First edition===

Part of the memoir first appeared as &quot;Pamietniki Szpilmana&quot; (&quot;Szpilman&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;) in the summer of 1946 in &quot;PrzekrÃ³j&quot;, a Polish weekly magazine, under the byline of Jerzy Waldorff, a Polish music critic and popular author whom Szpilman had met on vacation in Krynica in 1938.

The book, &quot;ÅmierÄ Miasta. PamiÄtniki WÅadysÅawa Szpilmana 1939â1945&quot; (&quot;Death of a City: Memoirs of WÅadysÅaw Szpilman 1939â1945&quot;), was published in 1946 by Wiedza. Waldorff was named as the editor, rather than author. He added a commentary and introduction, explaining in the latter that he had written down the story as told by Szpilman. The decision to present Szpilman as the author was made by the publishing house, according to Krzysztof Lichtblau of Szczecin University, citing Waldorff&#x27;s biographer, Mariusz Urbanek. The oral testimonies of Holocaust survivors were regularly put down on paper by professional writers.

According to Wolf Biermann in his afterword in the German and English editions, &quot;ÅmierÄ Miasta&quot; was withdrawn from circulation after a few months by the Polish censors. An eyewitness account of the collaboration of Jews, Russians and Poles with Germans did not sit well with Stalinist Poland or, indeed, with anyone, he wrote.

===German and English translations===
In 1998 a German translation by Karin Wolff was published by Econ Verlag as &quot;Das wunderbare Ãberleben: Warschauer Erinnerungen&quot; (&quot;The Miraculous Survival: Warsaw Memories&quot;). This new edition named WÅadysÅaw Szpilman as the sole author, and included Biermann&#x27;s afterword, part of a memoir by Wilm Hosenfeld, and a foreword by Szpilman&#x27;s son, Andrzej Szpilman. Waldorff told &quot;Å»ycie Warszawy&quot; that he was hurt that his name had been omitted, although everything was legal because Szpilman owned the copyrights. After the interview, Szpilman reportedly stopped talking to Waldorff. Waldorff filed a lawsuit, and the Polish Society of Authors and Composers (ZAiKS) worked out a settlement, which stipulated that Waldorff&#x27;s name be included in subsequent editions. He was also compensated financially.

In 1999 Victor Gollancz published an English translation by Anthea Bell as &quot;The Pianist: The Extraordinary Story of One Man&#x27;s Survival in Warsaw, 1939â45&quot;. The English edition was probably translated from the German; Bell did not translate from Polish. WÅadysÅaw Szpilman was named as the author and copyright holder, and Jerzy Waldorff as responsible for the compilation of the first edition. Victor Gollancz Ltd holds the copyright of Bell&#x27;s translation. 

===New editions: Polish, German===
A new Polish edition, &quot;Pianista: Warszawskie Wspomnienia 1939â1945&quot;, appeared in 2000. A new German edition, &quot;Der Pianist: Mein wunderbares Ãberleben&quot;, appeared in 2002.

==Screen==
Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and CzesÅaw MiÅosz wrote a screenplay, &quot;Robinson Warszawski&quot; (&quot;Robinson of Warsaw&quot;), based on the book, but communist government censors insisted on drastic revisions: Szpilman, for example, became the non-Jewish Rafalski, and the German army officer became Austrian. MiÅosz withdrew his name from the credits. The censored version was released in 1950 as &quot;Miasto nieujarzmione&quot; (&quot;Unvanquished City&quot;), directed by Jerzy Zarzycki.

Two years after Szpilman&#x27;s death, Roman Polanski, who lived in the KrakÃ³w ghetto as a child, directed &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002), starring Adrien Brody as Szpilman and Thomas Kretschmann as Hosenfeld, with a screenplay by Ronald Harwood. The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. In 2003 at the 75th Academy Awards, it won best adapted screenplay for Harwood, best actor for Brody, and best director for Polanski; the best film and best direction at the 56th British Academy Film Awards; and the CÃ©sar Award for best film.

==Concerts and readings==
As part of the 2007 Manchester International Festival, passages from Szpilman&#x27;s book were recited by Peter Guinness, accompanied by the pianist Mikhail Rudy. Directed by Neil Bartlett, the performance took place in the warehouse attic of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. The disused railway tracks outside the building recalled the trains that took the Jews from the ghetto to the concentration camps. The idea for the performance was conceived by Rudy, who gained the backing of Andrzej Szpilman. Rudy also performed at a concert dedicated to Szpilman&#x27;s music, where he met his relatives.

A presentation of &quot;The Pianist&quot; was organized by Andrzej Szpilman in 2014 in Germany, with music by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin and WÅadyslaw Szpilman performed by Ewa Kupiec. Szpilman recited parts of the book.

<text>Germersheim () is a district in the south-east of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) SÃ¼dliche WeinstraÃe, Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis, the district Karlsruhe as well as the district-free city of Karlsruhe, and the French &quot;dÃ©partement&quot; Bas-Rhin.

==History==
Most of the region was part of the Palatinate from the 11th century on. The bishops of Speyer owned some lands, too. The Palatinate was destroyed in the Napoleonic Wars, and the clerical states of Germany were dissolved in 1803. After a period of French occupation the Congress of Vienna decided to hand the territories over to Bavaria. The region remained a part of Bavaria until World War II; afterwards it was incorporated into the newly established state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

==Geography==
The Rhine river marks (with a few exceptions) the eastern boundary of the district, the river Lauter most of the southern boundary. The landscape of the district consists of the Rhine valley, in the north and east meeting the jungle-like areas of old Rhine arms, in the south covering the Bienwald, a forest stretching into the north of Alsace.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the Palatine Lion in the top part, and the cross of Speyer in the bottom part. The wavy line in the middle symbolizes the Rhine river, and the escutcheon in the middle is from the coat of arms of the city of Germersheim.

<doc id="221277" wikidata="Q937104" url="?curid=221277" title="Kernel panic">
<text>A kernel panic (sometimes abbreviated as KP) is a safety measure taken by an operating system&#x27;s kernel upon detecting an internal fatal error in which either it is unable to safely recover or continuing to run the system would have a higher risk of major data loss. The term is largely specific to Unix and Unix-like systems. The equivalent on Microsoft Windows operating systems is a stop error, often called a &quot;blue screen of death&quot;.

The kernel routines that handle panics, known as codice_1 in AT&amp;T-derived and BSD Unix source code, are generally designed to output an error message to the console, dump an image of kernel memory to disk for post-mortem debugging, and then either wait for the system to be manually rebooted, or initiate an automatic reboot. The information provided is of a highly technical nature and aims to assist a system administrator or software developer in diagnosing the problem. Kernel panics can also be caused by errors originating outside kernel space. For example, many Unix operating systems panic if the init process, which runs in user space, terminates.

==History==
The Unix kernel maintains internal consistency and runtime correctness with assertions as the fault detection mechanism. The basic assumption is that the hardware and the software should perform correctly and a failure of an assertion results in a &quot;panic&quot;, i.e. a voluntary halt to all system activity. The kernel panic was introduced in an early version of Unix and demonstrated a major difference between the design philosophies of Unix and its predecessor Multics. Multics developer Tom van Vleck recalls a discussion of this change with Unix developer Dennis Ritchie:

I remarked to Dennis that easily half the code I was writing in Multics was error recovery code. He said, &quot;We left all that stuff out. If there&#x27;s an error, we have this routine called panic, and when it is called, the machine crashes, and you holler down the hall, &#x27;Hey, reboot it.

The original codice_1 function was essentially unchanged from Fifth Edition UNIX to the VAX-based UNIX 32V and output only an error message with no other information, then dropped the system into an endless idle loop. As the Unix codebase was enhanced, the codice_1 function was also enhanced to dump various forms of debugging information to the console.

==Causes==
A panic may occur as a result of a hardware failure or a software bug in the operating system. In many cases, the operating system is capable of continued operation after an error has occurred. If the system is in an unstable state, rather than risking security breaches and data corruption, the operating system stops in order to prevent further damage, which helps to facilitate diagnosis of the error and may restart automatically.

After recompiling a kernel binary image from source code, a kernel panic while booting the resulting kernel is a common problem if the kernel was not correctly configured, compiled or installed. Add-on hardware or malfunctioning RAM could also be sources of fatal kernel errors during start up, due to incompatibility with the OS or a missing device driver. A kernel may also go into codice_1 if it is unable to locate a root file system. During the final stages of kernel userspace initialization, a panic is typically triggered if the spawning of init fails. A panic might also be triggered if the init process terminates, as the system would then be unusable.

The following is an implementation of the Linux kernel final initialization in codice_5:&lt;ref name=&quot;lxr, init/main.c&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

static int __ref kernel_init(void *unused)


 * We try each of these until one succeeds.
 * The Bourne shell can be used instead of init if we are
 * trying to recover a really broken machine.
 if (execute_command) {
 if (!run_init_process(execute_command))
 return 0;
 pr_err(&quot;Failed to execute %s. Attempting defaults...\n&quot;,
 execute_command);
 if (!run_init_process(&quot;/sbin/init&quot;) ||
 !run_init_process(&quot;/etc/init&quot;) ||
 !run_init_process(&quot;/bin/init&quot;) ||
 !run_init_process(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;))
 return 0;

 panic(&quot;No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel. &quot;
 &quot;See Linux Documentation/init.txt for guidance.&quot;);
 

==Operating system specifics==

===Linux===

Kernel panics appear in Linux like in other Unix-like systems; however, serious but non-fatal errors can generate another kind of error condition, known as a kernel oops. In this case, the kernel normally continues to run after killing the offending process. As an oops could cause some subsystems or resources to become unavailable, they can later lead to a full kernel panic.

On Linux, a kernel panic causes keyboard LEDs to blink as a visual indication of a critical condition.

As of Linux 6.10, drm_panic was merged allowing DRM drivers to support drawing a panic screen to inform the user that a panic occurred. This allows a panic screen to appear even when a display server was running when the panic occurred.

As of Linux 6.12, drm_panic was extended where the stack trace can be encoded as a QR code.

===macOS===
When a kernel panic occurs in Mac OS X 10.2 through 10.7, the computer displays a multilingual message informing the user that they need to reboot the system. Prior to 10.2, a more traditional Unix-style panic message was displayed; in 10.8 and later, the computer automatically reboots and the message is only displayed as a skippable warning afterward. The format of the message varies from version to version:

* 10.0â10.1: The system displays text on the screen, giving details about the error, and becomes unresponsive.
* 10.2: Rolls down a black transparent curtain then displays a message on a white background informing the user that they should restart the computer. The message is shown in English, French, German and Japanese.
* 10.3â10.5: Similar to 10.2, but the background of the error message is dark grey.
* 10.6â10.7: The text has been revised and now includes a Spanish translation.
* 10.8 and later: The computer becomes unresponsive before it immediately reboots. After restarting, it shows a message for a few seconds informing the user that a problem caused the computer to restart, before continuing to boot. The message now includes a Chinese translation.

If five new kernel panics occur within three minutes of the first one, the Mac will display a prohibitory sign for thirty seconds, and then shut down; this is known as a &quot;recurring kernel panic&quot;.

In all versions above 10.2, the text is superimposed on a standby symbol and is not full screen. Debugging information is saved in NVRAM and written to a log file on reboot. In 10.7 there is a feature to automatically restart after a kernel panic. In some cases, on 10.2 and later, white text detailing the error may appear in addition to the standby symbol.

<doc id="221278" wikidata="Q19215" url="?curid=221278" title="Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference">
<text>The Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and a central part of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#x27;s united front system. Its members advise and put proposals for political and social issues to government bodies. However, the CPPCC is a body without real legislative power. While consultation does take place, it is supervised and directed by the CCP.

The body traditionally consists of delegates from the CCP and its people&#x27;s organizations, eight legally permitted political parties subservient to the CCP, as well as nominally independent members. The CPPCC is chaired by a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the CCP. In keeping with the united front strategy, prominent non-CCP members have been included among the Vice Chairs, examples being Chen Shutong, Li Jishen and Soong Ching-ling.

The organizational hierarchy of the CPPCC consists of a National Committee and regional committees. Regional committees extend to the provincial, prefecture, and county level. According to the charter of the CPPCC, the relationship between the National Committee and the regional committees is one of guidance and not direct leadership. However, an indirect leadership exists via the United Front Work Department at each level. The National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference typically holds a yearly meeting at the same time as plenary sessions of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC). The CPPCC National Committee and NPC plenary sessions are collectively called the &quot;Quanguo Lianghui&quot; (&quot;National Two Sessions&quot;).

The CPPCC is intended to be more representative of a broader range of people than is typical of government office in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including a broad range of people from both inside and outside the CCP. The composition of the members of the CPPCC changes over time according to national strategic priorities. Previously dominated by senior figures in real-estate, state-owned enterprises, and &quot;princelings&quot;, the CPPCC in 2018 was primarily composed of individuals from China&#x27;s technology sector.

== History ==
The origins of the conference date prior to the existence of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. During negotiations between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang in 1945, the two parties agreed to open multiparty talks on post-World War II political reforms via a Political Consultative Conference. This was included in the Double Tenth Agreement. This agreement was implemented by the National Government of the Republic of China, who organized the first Political Consultative Assembly from 10 to 31 January 1946. Representatives of the Kuomintang, CCP, Chinese Youth Party, and China Democratic League, as well as independent delegates, attended the conference in Chongqing.

After major successes in the civil war, the CCP, on 1 May 1948, invited the other political parties, popular organizations and community leaders to form a new Political Consultative Conference to discuss a new state and new coalition government.

In 1949, with the CCP having gained control of most of mainland China, they organized a &quot;new&quot; Political Consultative Conference in September, inviting delegates from various friendly parties to attend and discuss the establishment of a new state. This conference was then renamed the People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference. On 29 September 1949, the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference unanimously adopted the Common Program as the basic political program for the country. The conference approved the new national anthem, flag, capital city, and state name, and elected the first government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

From 1949 to 1954, the conference became the &quot;de facto&quot; legislature of the PRC. During this period, it issued nearly 3,500 laws, laying the foundations of the newly established PRC. In 1954, the Constitution transferred legislative functions to the National People&#x27;s Congress.

During the Hundred Flowers Campaign between 1956 and 1957, Mao Zedong encouraged members of the CPPCC to speak about the shortcomings of the CCP. However, those who did faced severe repercussions such as heavy criticism and or incarceration in labor camps in the subsequent Anti-Rightist Campaign.

Along with most other institutions, the CPPCC was effectively decimated during the Cultural Revolution. It was revived during the First Session of its 5th National Committee between 24 February to 8 March 1974, during which Deng Xiaoping was elected as its chairman. New rules for the CPPCC were issued in 1983, which limited the proportion of CCP members to 40 percent.

Since the beginning of economic reforms, the CPPCC increasingly focused on accommodating Hong Kong and Macau elites and attracting investment from overseas Chinese communities. A new &quot;Economy Sector&quot; was created inside the CPPCC in 1993, and the 1990s saw an increase in the number of business-oriented CPPCC members, many of whom saw the CPPCC as a way to network and communicate with officials in the party-state apparatus.

When plans for the Sanxia (Three Gorges) Dam were revived by the CCP during the emphasis on the Four Modernizations during the early period of Reform and Opening Up, the CPPCC became a center of opposition to the project. It convened panels of experts who recommended delaying the project.

== Present role ==
The CPPCC is the highest-ranking body in the united front system. It is the &quot;peak united front forum, bringing together CCP officials and Chinese elites.&quot; According to Sinologist Peter Mattis, the CPPCC is &quot;the one place where all the relevant actors inside and outside the party come together: party elders, intelligence officers, diplomats, propagandists, soldiers and political commissars, united front workers, academics, and businesspeople.&quot; In practice, the CPPCC serves as &quot;the place where messages are developed and distributed among party members and the non-party faithful who shape perceptions of the CCP and China.&quot;

The CPPCC includes deputies elected from the CCP and its people&#x27;s organizations, the eight legally permitted political parties subservient to the CCP, as well as nominally independent deputies The party&#x27;s Organization Department is responsible for the nomination of prospective deputies who are CCP members.

The CPPCC provides a deputy &quot;seat&quot; for the 8 non-communist parties and so-called &quot;patriotic democrats&quot;. The CPPCC also reserves seats for overseas delegates, as well as regional deputies from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Non-communist party members of the CPPCC are nominated by the party&#x27;s United Front Work Department for appointment or election to the Conference.

The conception of the non-communist parties as part of a coalition rather than an opposition is expressed in the PRC&#x27;s constitutional principle of &quot;political consultation and multiparty cooperation.&quot; In principle, the CCP is obliged to consult the others on all major policy issues. In the early 2000s, CPPCC deputies frequently petitioned the CCP Central Committee regarding socioeconomic, health, and environmental issues.

According to state media Xinhua News Agency, the CPPCC is described as an &quot;organization in the patriotic united front of the Chinese people.&quot; It is further explained that the CPPCC is neither a body of state power nor a policy-making organ, but rather a platform for &quot;various political parties, people&#x27;s organizations, and people of all ethnic groups and from all sectors of society&quot; to participate in state affairs.

As a united front organ, the CPPCC collaborates with the CCP&#x27;s United Front Work Department. According to Mattis, the CPPCC gathers the society&#x27;s elite, while the UFWD &quot;implements policy and handles the nuts and bolts of united front work.&quot; The UFWD oversees the people&#x27;s organizations&#x27; deputies, who constitute the membership of the CPPCC, and manages any nomination work for potential deputies to be elected to the Conference from these organizations.

== National Committee ==

The National Committee of CPPCC (, shortened ) is the national-level organization that represents the CPPCC nationally and is composed of deputies from various sectors of society. Deputies of the National Committee are elected for five-year terms, though this can be extended in exceptional circumstances by a two-thirds majority vote of all deputies of the Standing Committee.

The National Committee holds plenary sessions annually, though a session can be called by the National Committee&#x27;s Standing Committee if necessary. The plenary sessions are generally held in March, around the same date as the annual session of the National People&#x27;s Congress; together, these meetings are termed as the Two Sessions. During the Two Sessions, the CPPCC and the NPC hear and discuss reports from the premier, the prosecutor general, and the chief justice. Every CPPCC plenary session makes amendments to the CPPCC charter, elects on every first plenary session the Standing Committee, which handles the regular affairs of the body, and adopts resolutions on the National Committee&#x27;s &quot;major working principles and tasks&quot;. The Standing Committee is responsible for selecting deputies to the Conference, implementing the CPPCC&#x27;s resolutions, and interpreting its official charter.

The National Committee is led by a chairman, currently Wang Huning, one of the highest-ranking offices in the country; since its establishment, all CPPCC chairpersons have been a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the CCP except during transition periods, being at least its 4th-ranking member. The chairman is assisted by several vice chairpersons and a secretary-general, who heads the National Committee&#x27;s General Office; together, they make up the Chairperson&#x27;s Council, which handles the day-to-day affairs of the Standing Committee and convences its sessions on an average of at least one committee session per month, unlike the SC-NPC which holds its sessions bimonthy. Council meetings coordinate work reports sent to the Standing Committee and the wider National Committee, review united front work, identify the issues to focus on during SC-NCCPPCC sessions and the annual general plenary, and highlight important ideological directions of the CCP. It also presides over the preparatory meeting of the first plenary session of the next National Committee.

The CCP and the aligned minor parties are assigned deputies in the National Committee. Besides political parties, the NC-CPPCC has also deputies from various sectors of society in its ranks. Members include scientists, academics, writers, artists, retired government officials, and entrepreneurs, among other sectors. The parties and groups with elected deputies to the NC-CPPCC are as follows:
=== Standing Committee of the National Committee ===
The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference performs the duties of the CPPCC in between plenary sessions of the National Committee. It is responsible for all actions taken by the whole of the National Committee of the Conference or by individual deputies of it. According to the bylaw, the Chairman of the National Committee is Chairman of the Standing Committee &quot;ex officio&quot;.

=== Special Committees of the National Committee ===
The National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference contains several Special Committees, which are headed by the Standing Committee. The Special Committees typically have around sixty individual members, including a chairperson and ten or more vice-chairs. Like the main Conference, the Special Committees include a wide range of deputies from the relevant sectors forming its membership. The CPPCC National Committee currently has 10 Special Committees organized similarly to that of the Standing Committee:
# Committee for Handling Proposals
# Committee for Economic Affairs
# Committee for Agriculture and Rural Affairs
# Committee of Population, Resources and Environment
# Committee of Education, Science, Culture, Health and Sports
# Committee for Social and Legal Affairs
# Committee for Ethnic and Religious Affairs
# Committee for Liaison with Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese
# Committee of Foreign Affairs
# Committee on Culture, Historical Data and Studies

=== Publication ===
The &quot;Peopleâs Political Consultative Daily&quot; (äººæ°æ¿åæ¥) is the official newspaper of the National Committee of the CPPCC.

== Regional committees ==
In addition to the main National Committee, the CPPCC contains numerous regional committees at the provincial, prefecture, and county level. According to an old post in CPPCC&#x27;s website, there were 3,164 local CPPCC committees at every level by the end of 2006, containing around 615,164 deputies elected in like manner as the National Committee. Like the National Committee, the regional committees serve for five year terms, have a chairperson, vice chairpersons and a secretary-general, convene plenary sessions at least once a year, and have a standing committee with similar functions. According to the CPPCC charter, the relationship between the National Committee and the local committees, as well as the relationship between the local committee and lower-level committees is &quot;one of guidance&quot;.

The following regional committees are modeled after the National Committee with identical composition of deputies elected to them and are each supervised by regional level Standing Committees:

* CPPCC province-level committees
** including regional committees of the autonomous regions and city committees of directly controlled municipal governments (Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing and Shanghai)
* CPPCC prefecture-level committees
** including autonomous prefectural committees and city committees of sub-provincial and prefectural cities
* CPPCC county-level committees
** including committees of autonomous counties and country-level cities

<text>Lawrence Monsanto Ferlinghetti (March 24, 1919 â February 22, 2021) was an American poet, painter, social activist, and co-founder of City Lights Booksellers &amp; Publishers. An author of poetry, translations, fiction, theatre, art criticism, and film narration, Ferlinghetti was best known for his second collection of poems, &quot;A Coney Island of the Mind&quot; (1958), which has been translated into nine languages and sold over a million copies. When Ferlinghetti turned 100 in March 2019, the city of San Francisco turned his birthday, March 24, into &quot;Lawrence Ferlinghetti Day&quot;.

==Early life==
Ferlinghetti was born on March 24, 1919, in Yonkers, New York. 
Shortly before his birth, his father, Carlo, a native of Brescia, died of a heart attack; and his mother, Clemence Albertine (nÃ©e Mendes-Monsanto), of Portuguese Sephardic Jewish descent, was committed to a mental hospital shortly after. He was raised by an aunt, and later by foster parents. He attended the Mount Hermon School for Boys (later Northfield Mount Hermon) graduating in 1937, then the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a B.A. in journalism in 1941. He began his journalism career by writing sports for &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot;, and published his first short stories in &quot;Carolina Magazine&quot;, for which Thomas Wolfe had written.

He served in the U.S. Navy throughout World War II, as the captain of a submarine chaser in the Normandy invasion. In 1947, he earned an M.A. degree in English literature from Columbia University with a thesis on John Ruskin and the British painter J. M. W. Turner. From Columbia, he went to the University of Paris and earned a Ph.D. in comparative literature with a dissertation on Paris as a symbol in modern poetry.

== Personal life ==
Ferlinghetti met his wife-to-be, Selden Kirby-Smith, the granddaughter of Edmund Kirby-Smith, in 1946 aboard a ship en route to France. They were both heading to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. Kirby-Smith went by the nickname Kirby. Their marriage ended in divorce but produced two children.

== City Lights ==
He moved to San Francisco in 1951 and founded City Lights in North Beach in 1953, in partnership with Peter D. Martin, a student at San Francisco State University. They both invested $500. In 1955 Ferlinghetti bought Martin&#x27;s share and established a publishing house with the same name. The first series he published was the Pocket Poets Series. He was arrested for publishing Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;, resulting in a First Amendment trial in 1957, where Ferlinghetti was charged with publishing an obscene workâand acquitted.

==Poetry==

Ferlinghetti published many of the Beat poets and is considered by some as a Beat poet as well. Yet Ferlinghetti did not consider himself to be a Beat poet, as he said in the 2013 documentary &quot;Ferlinghetti: Rebirth of Wonder&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t call me a Beat. I never was a Beat poet.&quot;

Ferlinghetti penned much of his early poetry in the vein of T. S. Eliot. Ferlinghetti told poet and critic Jack Foley, &quot;Everything I wrote sounded just like him.&quot; Yet, even in his poems inspired by Eliot such as Ferlinghetti&#x27;s &quot;Constantly Risking Absurdity,&quot; Ferlinghetti is ever the populist as he compares the poet first to a trapeze artist in a circus and then to a &quot;little charleychaplin man.&quot;

Critics have noted that Ferlinghetti&#x27;s poetry often takes on a highly visual dimension as befits this poet who was also a painter. As Jack Foley notes, Ferlinghetti&#x27;s poems &quot;tell little stories, make &#x27;pictures&#x27;.&quot; Ferlinghetti as a poet paints with his words pictures full of color capturing the average American experience as seen in his poem &quot;In Golden Gate Park that Day: &quot;In Golden Gate Park that day/ a man and his wife were coming along/ ... He was wearing green suspenders ... while his wife was carrying a bunch of grapes.&quot; 

In the first poem in &quot;A Coney Island of the Mind&quot; entitled, &quot;In Goya&#x27;s Greatest Scenes, We Seem To See,&quot; Ferlinghetti describes with words the &quot;suffering humanity&quot; that Goya portrayed by brush in his paintings. Ferlinghetti concludes his poem with the recognition that &quot;suffering humanity&quot; today might be painted as average Americans drowning in the materialism: &quot;on a freeway fifty lanes wide/ a concrete continent/ spaced with bland billboards/ illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness.&quot;

Ferlinghetti took a distinctly populist approach to poetry, emphasizing throughout his work &quot;that art should be accessible to all people, not just a handful of highly educated intellectuals.&quot; Larry Smith, an American author and editor, stated that Ferlinghetti is a poet &quot;of the people engaged conscientiously in the creation of new poetic and cultural forms.&quot; This perception of art as a broad socio-cultural force, as opposed to an elitist academic enterprise, is explicitly evident in Poem 9 from &quot;Pictures of the Gone World&quot;, wherein the speaker states: Truth is not the secret of a few&#x27; / yet / you would maybe think so / the way some / librarians / and cultural ambassadors and / especially museum directors / act&quot; (1â8). In addition to Ferlinghetti&#x27;s aesthetic egalitarianism, this passage highlights two additional formal features of the poet&#x27;s work, namely, his incorporation of a common American idiom as well as his experimental approach to line arrangement which, as Crale Hopkins notes, is inherited from the poetry of William Carlos Williams.

Reflecting his broad aesthetic concerns, Ferlinghetti&#x27;s poetry often engages with several non-literary artistic forms, most notably jazz music and painting. William Lawlor asserts that much of Ferlinghetti&#x27;s free verse attempts to capture the spontaneity and imaginative creativity of modern jazz; the poet is noted for having frequently incorporated jazz accompaniments into public readings of his work.

==Political engagement==
Soon after settling in San Francisco in 1951, Ferlinghetti met the poet Kenneth Rexroth, whose concepts of philosophical anarchism influenced his political development. He self-identified as a philosophical anarchist, regularly associated with other anarchists in North Beach, and sold Italian anarchist newspapers at the City Lights Bookstore. While Ferlinghetti said he was &quot;an anarchist at heart&quot;, he conceded that the world would need to be populated by &quot;saints&quot; in order for pure anarchism to be lived practically. Hence he espoused what can be achieved by Scandinavian-style democratic socialism.

In the early 1960s, Ferlinghetti was a supporter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. On January 14, 1967, he was a featured presenter at the Gathering of the tribes &quot;Human Be-In,&quot; which drew tens of thousands of people and launched what would become known as San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. In 1968, Ferlinghetti signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse to pay his Federal income tax as a protest against the Vietnam War. 

In 1998, in his inaugural address as Poet Laureate of San Francisco, Ferlinghetti urged San Franciscans to vote to remove a portion of the earthquake-damaged Central Freeway and replace it with a boulevard: 

==Painting==
Alongside his bookselling and publishing, Ferlinghetti painted for 60 years and much of his work was displayed in galleries and museums throughout the United States.

Ferlinghetti painted &quot;The beautiful Madonna of Sandusky Oh! hi! O! And friend&quot; during a 1996 visit to an art co-op in Sandusky, Ohio, which was subsequently vandalized and censored by a janitor the night after it was painted. Ferlinghetti responded to this act by painting a humorous retort on areas of the canvas where censorship had occurred.

A retrospective of Ferlinghetti&#x27;s artwork, &quot;60 Years of Painting&quot;, was staged in Rome and Reggio Calabria in 2010.

==Jack Kerouac Alley==

In 1987, he was the initiator of the transformation of Jack Kerouac Alley, located at the side of his shop. He presented his idea to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors calling for repavement and renewal.

==Death==
Ferlinghetti died of interstitial lung disease on February 22, 2021, at his home in San Francisco, a month before his 102nd birthday. He was buried in his family plot at Bolinas Cemetery in Bolinas, California.

==Awards==

Ferlinghetti received numerous awards, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Robert Kirsch Award, the BABRA Award for Lifetime Achievement, the National Book Critics Circle Ivan Sandrof Award for Contribution to American Arts and Letters, and the ACLU Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award. He won the Premio Taormina in 1973, and thereafter was awarded the Premio Camaiore, the Premio Flaiano, the Premio Cavour, among other honors in Italy. The &quot;Career Award&quot; was conferred on October 28, 2017 at the XIV edition of the &quot;Premio di Arti Letterarie Metropoli di Torino&quot; in Turin.

Ferlinghetti was named San Francisco&#x27;s Poet Laureate in August 1998 and served for two years. In 2003 he was awarded the Poetry Society of America&#x27;s Frost Medal, the Author&#x27;s Guild Lifetime Achievement Award, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The National Book Foundation honored him with the inaugural Literarian Award (2005), given for outstanding service to the American literary community. In 2007 he was named Commandeur, French Order of Arts and Letters. In 2008, Ferlinghetti was awarded the John Ciardi Award for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry. This award is handed out by the National Italian American Foundation to honor the author who has made the greatest contribution to the writing of Italian American poetry.

In 2012, Ferlinghetti was awarded the inaugural Janus Pannonius International Poetry Prize from the Hungarian PEN Club. After learning that the government of Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n is a partial sponsor of the prize, he declined to accept the award. In declining, Ferlinghetti cited his opposition to the &quot;right-wing regime&quot; of Prime Minister OrbÃ¡n, and his opinion that the ruling Hungarian government under Mr. OrbÃ¡n is curtailing civil liberties and freedom of speech for the people of Hungary.

==In popular culture==

Frank Zappa namedropped Lawrence Ferlinghetti as one of the people who influenced his band&#x27;s music, in the sleeve of his debut album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; (1966). 

Ferlinghetti recited the poem &quot;Loud Prayer&quot; at The Band&#x27;s final performance; the concert was filmed by Martin Scorsese and released as a documentary entitled &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978), which included Ferlinghetti&#x27;s recitation. Ferlinghetti was the subject of the 2013 Christopher Felver documentary, &quot;Lawrence Ferlinghetti: A Rebirth of Wonder&quot;. Andrew Rogers played Ferlinghetti in the 2010 film &quot;Howl&quot;. Christopher Felver made the 2013 documentary on Ferlinghetti, &quot;Lawrence Ferlinghetti: A Rebirth of Wonder&quot;.

In 2011, Ferlinghetti contributed two of his poems to the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Italian unification, &quot;Song of the Third World War&quot; and &quot;Old Italians Dying&quot; inspired by the artists of the exhibition &quot;Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Italy 150&quot; held in Turin, Italy (MayâJune 2011). On the book of lithographs &quot;The Sea Within Us&quot; first published in Italy as &quot;Il Mare Dentro&quot; in 2012, Ferlinghetti collaborated with lithographer and abstract artist James Claussen. Julio CortÃ¡zar, in his &quot;Rayuela&quot; (&quot;Hopscotch&quot;) (1963), references a poem from &quot;A Coney Island of the Mind&quot; in Chapter 121.

<doc id="221281" wikidata="Q369936" url="?curid=221281" title="Rashid Ali al-Gaylani">
<text>Rashid Ali al-Gaylani (Al-Gailani) (, )Â (1892 â 28 August 1965) was an Iraqi politician who served as Prime Minister of Iraq on three occasions: from March to November 1933, from March 1940 to February 1941 and from April to May 1941. He is chiefly remembered as an ardent Arab nationalist and Arab fascist who attempted to remove British influence from Iraq by starting a coup against the government in 1941. During his brief tenures as prime minister in 1940 and 1941, he attempted to negotiate settlements with the Axis powers during World War II to counter British influence in Iraq.

==Early life==
Rashid Ali was the son of Sayyid Abd al-Wahhab al-Gailani and born into the prominent Baghdad-based Al-Gailani family. The name &quot;Al-Gailani&quot; indicates that their ancestors originated in Gilan, Iran. He also had origins in the Circassian governors of the Ottoman Vilayet. Members of the Gailani family were known as &quot;sayed&quot;, as the family&#x27;s ancestry can be traced back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Rashid Ali enrolled in law school in Baghdad and was a lawyer until his political career.

==Political career==
In 1924, Rashid Ali al-Gailani began his career in politics in the first government led by Prime Minister Yasin al-Hashimi. Yasin al-Hashimi appointed Gailani as the Minister of Justice. The two men were ardent nationalists and were opposed to any British involvement in the internal politics of Iraq. They rejected the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty signed by the government of Prime Minister Nuri as-Said in 1930. They formed the Party of National Brotherhood to promote nationalist aims. Gaylani served as prime minister for the first time in 1933 but held office for less than eight months. In 1938 he was seized and exiled to &#x27;Ana for his suspected role in the Baghdad bomb-throwing of November and the general political upheaval.

He was elected as the president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1925 and 1926.

During the Hashimi government, Gailani served as Minister of Interior with the additional benefit of the lucrative trusteeship of the Qadiri Awqaf. Later, as prime minister, he would retain the interior portfolio as public works projects progressed, including the laying of the foundations for a mosque to be named the Faysal Mosque.

On 31 March 1940, when Gailani was again appointed prime minister, World War II had started and Iraq had just experienced the premature death of King Ghazi. Ghazi&#x27;s reign was followed by a Regency for his four-year-old son who was now the new King Faisal II. Faisal&#x27;s Regent was Ghazi&#x27;s uncle, Emir Abdul-Illah. Abdul-Illah supported Britain in the war, but he was unable to control Gaylani, who used the war to further his own nationalist goals by refusing to allow Allied troops passage through Iraq to the front. He also rejected calls for Iraq to break its ties with Fascist Italy and sent his Justice Minister, Naji Shawkat, to Ankara to meet with Germany&#x27;s ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, to win German support for his government. German Foreign Ministry archives record that Shawkat met von Papen on July 5, 1940, and he carried a letter of introduction from Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, expressing a desire for a treaty of friendship and collaboration. Baghdad was the early base for Nazi Middle East intelligence operations during World War II.

===1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;Ã©tat===


Britain responded with severe economic sanctions against Iraq. Meanwhile, news of British victories against Italian forces in North Africa weakened support for Gaylani. On 31 January 1941, under pressure from Regent Abdul-Illah, he resigned as prime minister. This only exacerbated his mistrust of Britain and its supporters in the government. Together with the members of the Golden Square, Gaylani made plans to assassinate Regent Abdul-Illah and seize power. On 31 March, Abdul-Illah discovered the plot to assassinate him and fled the country.

On April 1, the Golden Square executed their coup d&#x27;Ã©tat; on April 3, the &quot;National Defence Government&quot; replaced the government of the Regent with Gaylani as prime minister. As one of his first acts, Gaylani sent an Iraqi artillery force to confront the RAF base in Habbaniya. By the end of April, Iraqi troops held strong positions on the escarpment above the base, and a siege began.

Iraq had been a major supplier of petroleum to the Allied war effort and represented an important landbridge between British forces in Egypt and India. To secure Iraq, Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered General Archibald Wavell to protect the air base at Habbaniya. On 18 April, British forces from India landed in Basra, &quot;Sabine Force&quot;. In the Mandatory Palestine, another force was created to enter Iraq from the west and relieve RAF Habbaniya, &quot;Habbaniya Force&quot;.

===Anglo-Iraqi War===
At Habbaniya, the besieging Iraqis demanded the cessation of all training activities and of all flights in and out of the base. On 2 May, the commander at RAF Habbaniya, Air Vice-Marshal Harry George Smart, responded to the Iraqi demands by launching a pre-emptive strike against the Iraqi forces overlooking the air base. This action initiated the Anglo-Iraqi War. Within a week, the Iraqis abandoned the escarpment. By mid-May, British forces consisting mainly of Assyrian levies from Habbaniya had moved on to Fallujah and, after overcoming Iraqi resistance there, moved on to Baghdad. On 30 May, as British troops were closing in on his position, Gaylani fled to Iran. 

On 31 May, an armistice between the British and the Iraqis was signed. On 1 June, the Regent returned to Baghdad and his government was restored. Immediately afterwards, the &quot;Farhud&quot;, a violent pogrom against Jews, took place in Baghdad.

===Iran, Italy, Germany and Saudi Arabia===
Gaylani was not to stay long in Iran. On 25 August 1941 the British and Soviet forces invaded Iran and removed Reza Shah from power. Gaylani then fled to Italy. Later he was received by German dictator Adolf Hitler in Berlin, and he was recognized as the leader of the Iraqi government in exile. Upon the defeat of Germany, Gaylani again fled and found refuge, this time in Saudi Arabia.

==Later life and death==
Gailani did not return from exile until after the revolution that overthrew the Iraqi monarchy, in 1958. Once again, he attempted to seize power; he plotted a revolt against Abdul Karim Kassem&#x27;s government. The revolt was foiled and Gaylani was sentenced to death. However, he was pardoned in July 1961, allowing him to live in Lebanon until 1965 when he died at the age of 72.

<doc id="221283" wikidata="Q190129" url="?curid=221283" title="Coat of arms of Sweden">
<text>The coat of arms of the Kingdom of Sweden () is the arms of dominion of the King of Sweden. It has a greater and a lesser version. The shield displays the &quot;Three Crowns of Sweden&quot; quartering the &quot;Lion of BjÃ¤lbo&quot;, with an inescutcheon overall of the House of Vasa impaling the House of Bernadotte.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, Act 1970:498 which states (in unofficial translation) that &quot;in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered.&quot;

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908. This law also formally codifies the differences between the &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot; arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&quot;A shield azure, quartered by a cross Or with outbent arms, and an inescutcheon containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three open crowns Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown Or armed gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the House of Vasa (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a &quot;vasa&quot; Or); and the House of Bernadotte (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. Supported by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a compartment Or. All surrounded by purpure mantling doubled ermine, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings Or.&quot;

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King Charles VIII in 1448.

The escutcheon used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 quarterings on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century, chosen as a symbol of Sweden&#x27;s eternal existence, as in the poem by Esaias TegnÃ©r:

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. The Big Dipper, or as it is called in Swedish, &quot;Karlavagnen&quot; (Charles&#x27; Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.



The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (&quot;queue fourchÃ©e&quot;), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the Order of Seraphim, the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the Royal House, with the alterations and additions decided by him.

Blazon: &quot;The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an inescutcheon containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the House of Vasa and the House of Bernadotte. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or.&quot;

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the Government of Sweden and subordinate State authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all Swedish police uniforms and in various coats of arms of the Swedish Armed Forces, and is displayed on Sweden&#x27;s passports and embassies.

Blazon: &quot;Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one.&quot; Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the Order of the Seraphim.&quot;

<doc id="221284" wikidata="Q5282576" url="?curid=221284" title="Dispersed knowledge">
<text>Dispersed knowledge in economics is the notion that no single agent has information as to all of the factors which influence prices and production throughout the system. The term has been both expanded upon and popularized by American economist Thomas Sowell. 

==Overview==
Each agent in a market for assets, goods, or services possesses incomplete knowledge as to most of the factors which affect prices in that market. For example, no agent has full information as to other agents&#x27; budgets, preferences, resources or technologies, not to mention their plans for the future and numerous other factors which affect prices in those markets.

Market prices are the result of price discovery, in which each agent participating in the market makes use of its current knowledge and plans to decide on the prices and quantities at which it chooses to transact. The resulting prices and quantities of transactions may be said to reflect the current state of knowledge of the agents currently in the market, even though no single agent commands information as to the entire set of such knowledge.

Some economists believe that market transactions provide the basis for a society to benefit from the knowledge that is dispersed among its constituent agents. For example, in his &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;, John Stuart Mill states that one of the justifications for a laissez faire government policy is his belief that self-interested individuals throughout the economy, acting independently, can make better use of dispersed knowledge than could the best possible government agency.
== Key characteristics ==
Friedrich Hayek claimed that &quot;dispersed knowledge is &quot;essentially&quot; dispersed, and cannot possibly be gathered together and conveyed to an authority charged with the task of deliberately creating order&quot;.

Today, the best and most comprehensive book on dispersed knowledge is &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot; by Thomas Sowell, which Hayek called &quot;the best book on general economics in many a year.&quot;

== Phenomena ==
* &quot;Dispersed knowledge will give rise to genuine uncertainty, which necessitates the contractual structure that we recognize as a firm.&quot;
* &quot;Dispersion of knowledge and genuine uncertainty contribute to the heterogeneity of expectations that must exist in order for one or more individuals to exploit the potential of the contractual structure of the firm.&quot;
* &quot;Dispersion of knowledge, genuine uncertainty, and heterogeneous expectations give rise to the nexus of the enterprising individual and the opportunity to discover, create, and exploit new markets.&quot;

== Drivers ==
# Large numbers: Large numbers have a great impact on actions in terms of two aspects. On the one hand, there will be an increase in time and other resource requirements. On the other hand, actors with bounded cognitive resources will lose overview.
# Asymmetries: Asymmetries have a two-sides effect. Firstly, asymmetries enable more possibilities regarding learning and competence development. Secondly, asymmetries &quot;increase differences between interpretative frameworks and the knowledge and competence profile of the different actors and thus make integration more difficult&quot;. 
# Uncertainty: Uncertainty is defined to be one of the drivers of dispersed knowledge which can give rise to management problems.

== Uncertainty ==
Dispersed knowledge will give rise to uncertainty which will lead to different kinds of results.
* 1. Dispersed knowledge causes different opinions and sources in cooperate organizations and it brings creativity.
Richard LeFauve highlights the advantages of organizational structure in companies:

&quot;Before if we had a tough decision to make, we would have two or three different perspectives with strong support of all three. In a traditional organization the bossman decides after heâs heard all three alternatives. At Saturn we take time to work it out, and what generally happens is that you end up with a fourth answer which none of the portions had in the first place. but one that all three portions of the organization fully support (AutoWeeR, Oct. 8, 1990. p. 20).&quot;

Companies are supposed to think highly of the dispersed knowledge and make adjustments to meet demands.
* 2. Dispersed knowledge causes management problems at the same time.
Tsoukas stated:

&quot;A firmâs knowledge is distributed, not only in a computational sense . . . or in Hayekâs (1945, p. 521) sense that the factual knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place cannot be surveyed as a whole. But, more radically, a firmâs knowledge is distributed in the sense that it is inherently indeterminate: nobody knows in advance what that knowledge is or need be. Firms are faced with radical uncertainty: they do not, they cannot, know what they need to know.&quot;

== Strategies ==
There are several strategies targeting at the problems caused by dispersed knowledge.

First of all, replacing knowledge by getting access to knowledge can be one of the strategies.

What&#x27;s more, the capability to complete incomplete knowledge can deal with knowledge gaps created by the dispersed knowledge.

In addition, making a design of institutions with reasonable coordination mechanisms can be regarded as the third strategy.

Besides, resolving organization units into smaller ones should be taken into consideration.

Last but not least, providing more data to decision maker will be helpful for making a correct decision.

<text>Roundaboutness, or roundabout methods of production, is the process whereby capital goods are produced first and then, with the help of the capital goods, the desired consumer goods are produced.

An argument against BÃ¶hm-Bawerk&#x27;s theory of roundaboutness, in economies with compound interest, was presented by Paul Samuelson during the Cambridge capital controversy.

The concept, interpreted as rising technical composition of capital, is also used by some Marxian authors.

<doc id="221294" wikidata="Q1065476" url="?curid=221294" title="Charles Mathews">
<text>Charles Mathews (28 June 1776, London â 28 June 1835, Devonport) was an English theatre manager and comic actor, well known during his time for his gift of impersonation and skill at table entertainment. His play &quot;At Home&quot;, in which he played every character, was the first monopolylogue and the defining work in the genre.

==Early life==
Charles was born to James Mathews (died 1804), a Wesleyan Methodist bookseller, printer, and pharmacist on the Strand, who also served as minister in one of the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s chapels. Charles was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in London, which had some openings for common boys. He was next apprenticed to his father. For religious reasons, the father forbade his children from visiting theatres. 

During his youth, Charles met the actor Robert William Elliston; after attending the Drury Lane theatre, he was utterly fascinated by that world. Charles left his father in September 1793 for his first public stage appearance at the Old Richmond Theatre. The following year his father allowed him to take up acting in Dublin, writing, &quot;Charles, there are your indentures, and there are twenty guineas; I do not approve of the stage, but I will not oppose your wishes. At any time hereafter, should you feel inclined to turn to an honest calling, there are twenty guineas more, if you send for them, and your father&#x27;s house is open to you.&quot; Charles never claimed the extra 20 guineas.

==Career==
For several years Mathews took bit parts, but on 15 May 1803 he made his first London appearance at the Haymarket, as Jabel in Cumberland&#x27;s &quot;The Jew&quot; and as Lingo in &quot;The Agreeable Surprise&quot;. As a continued public success, he was taken on at the Drury Lane. His gift for mimicry enabled him to disguise his personality without a change of costume. His versatility and originality were displayed in his one man show, or &quot;monodramatic entertainment,&quot; entitled &quot;At Home&quot; or &quot;Matthews at Home&quot;, which he initiated in the Lyceum Theatre in 1808. Leigh Hunt wrote that his table entertainments &quot;for the richness and variety of his humour, were as good as half a dozen plays distilled.&quot; The show combined mimicry, storytelling, recitations, improvisation, quick-change artistry, and comic song.

In 1822â1823 Mathews toured the United States to great success, though he was libeled by the &quot;Philadelphia Gazette&quot;. When he brought suit against the paper, he was awarded 3,000 crowns for damages. During his stay, he developed a number of impressions of American types. One of these was the African American, said to have been based on the American black actor James Hewlett, who performed Shakespeare roles at the African Grove. In his next show, &quot;A Trip to America&quot;, Mathews sang a version of the popular slave freedom song, &quot;Possum Up a Gum Tree&quot;, performing in dialect and possibly in blackface. One author called him &quot;the paterfamilias of the Yankee theatre and the progenitor of all native American dialect comedy.&quot;

&quot;A Trip to America&quot; also sparked an exchange of critical essays between Mathews and American critic John Neal in &quot;The European Magazine and London Review&quot; over what Neal considered the actor&#x27;s inaccurate portrayal of New Englanders. &quot;He knows, in his own heart,&quot; said Neal, &quot;that his Jonathan is a very poor, and very feeble counterfeit, unworthy of America, unworthy of Mr. M., as an actor, and altogether unworthy of his country. It is untrue and he knows it&quot;.

Returning to England in autumn 1823, he joined Frederick Henry Yates, manager of the Adelphi Theatre. During his successful career, Mathews, together with John Kemble and John Braham, was received as a guest by George IV. A few years after his return from the US, Mathews bought a half-share in the Adelphi Theatre. His connection with the Adelphi was a critical and popular success for Mathews, but not a financial success. In 1834, he made a second tour performing in the United States. He cut his trip short and returned ill from the tour, after his last appearance in New York City on 11 February 1835.

Failing to recover his health, Mathews died poor in Plymouth in June 1835, without appearing again on a British stage.

==Personal life==
In 1797, Mathews married Eliza Kirkham Strong (1772â1802) of Exeter, the author of a volume of poems and some novels, and an actress. She retired from the stage in 1801 and died in 1802.

In 1803, Mathews married Anne Jackson (died 1869), an actress and half sister to the actress Frances Maria Kelly. Anne Jackson Mathews wrote a biography of Mathews. His only child by his second wife was Charles James Mathews, who became a successful actor in turn.

== In popular culture ==
* The character of Alfred Jingle in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel, &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, is said to have been inspired by Mathews.

<doc id="221296" wikidata="Q467212" url="?curid=221296" title="Capital intensity">
<text>Capital intensity is the amount of fixed or real capital present in relation to other factors of production, especially labor. At the level of either a production process or the aggregate economy, it may be estimated by the capital to labor ratio, such as from the points along a capital/labor isoquant. The inverse of capital intensity is labor intensity. Capital intensity is sometimes associated with industrialism, while labor intensity is sometimes associated with agrarianism.

==Growth==
The use of tools and machinery makes labor more effective, so rising capital intensity (or &quot;capital deepening&quot;) pushes up the productivity of labor. Capital intensive societies tend to have a higher standard of living over the long run.

Calculations made by Robert Solow claimed that economic growth was mainly driven by technological progress (productivity growth) rather than inputs of capital and labor. However recent economic research has invalidated that theory, since Solow did not properly consider changes in both investment and labor inputs.

Dale Jorgenson, of Harvard University, President of the American Economic Association in 2000, concludes that: &#x27;Griliches and I showed that changes in the quality of capital and labor inputs and the quality of investment goods explained most of the Solow residual. We estimated that capital and labor inputs accounted for 85 percent of growth during the period 1945â1965, while only 15 percent could be attributed to productivity growthâ¦ This has precipitated the sudden obsolescence of earlier productivity research employing the conventions of Kuznets and Solow.&#x27;

John Ross has analysed the long term correlation between the level of investment in the economy, rising from 5-7% of GDP at the time of the Industrial Revolution in England, to 25% of GDP in the post-war German &#x27;economic miracle&#x27;, to over 35% of GDP in the world&#x27;s most rapidly growing contemporary economies of India and China.

Taking the G7 and other largest economies, Jorgenson and Vu conclude: &#x27;the growth of world output between input growth and productivityâ¦ input growth greatly predominatedâ¦ Productivity growth accounted for only one-fifth of the total during 1989-1995, while input growth accounted for almost four-fifths. Similarly, input growth accounted for more than 70 percent of growth after 1995, while productivity accounted for less than 30 percent.&#x27;

Regarding differences in output per capita Jorgenson and Vu conclude: &#x27;differences in per capita output levels are primarily explained by differences in per capital input, rather than variations in productivity&#x27;.

Some economists claimed that the Soviet Union missed the lessons of the Solow growth model, because starting in the 1930s, the Stalin government attempted to force capital accumulation through state direction of the economy. However, Solow&#x27;s calculations have been proven invalid, so this is a poor explanation. Modern research shows the main factor for economic growth is the growth of labor and capital inputs, not increases in productivity. Therefore, other factors besides capital accumulation must have been big contributors to the Soviet economic crisis.

Free market economists tend to believe that capital accumulation should not be managed by government, but instead be determined by market forces. Monetary stability (which increases confidence), low taxation, and greater freedom for the entrepreneur would then promote capital accumulation.

The Austrian School maintains that the capital intensity of any industry is due to the roundaboutness of the particular industry and consumer demand.

==Capital-intensive industry==
Capital intensive industry uses a large portion of capital to buy expensive machines, compared to their labor costs. The term came about in the mid- to late-nineteenth century as factories such as steel mills sprung up around the newly industrialized world. With the added expense of machinery, there was greater financial risk. This makes new capital-intensive factories with high tech machinery a small share of the marketplace, even though they raise productivity and output.
 Some businesses commonly thought to be capital-intensive are railways, aircraft manufacturing, airlines, oil production and refining, telecommunications, semiconductor fabrication, mining, chemical plants, electric power plants, 
etc.

==Measurement==
The degree of capital intensity is easy to measure in nominal terms. It is simply the ratio of the total money value of capital equipment to the total potential output. However, this measure need not be related to real economic activity because it can rise due to inflation. Then the question arises, how do we measure the &quot;real&quot; amount of capital goods? Do we use book value (historical price)? or replacement cost? or the price justified by the present discounted value of future profits? Or do we simply &quot;deflate&quot; the total current money value of capital equipment by the average price of capital goods?

This capital controversy points out that measure of capital intensity is not independent of the distribution of income, so that changes in the ratio of profits to wages lead to changes in measured capital intensity.

<doc id="221299" wikidata="Q1403813" url="?curid=221299" title="Intertemporal choice">
<text>In economics, intertemporal choice is the study of the relative value people assign to two or more payoffs at different points in time. This relationship is usually simplified to today and some future date. Intertemporal choice was introduced by Canadian economist John Rae in 1834 in the &quot;Sociological Theory of Capital&quot;. Later, Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk in 1889 and Irving Fisher in 1930 elaborated on the model.

== Fisher model ==
===Assumptions of the model===
# consumer&#x27;s income is constant
# maximization of the utility
# anything above the line is out of explanation
# investments are generators of savings
# any property is indivisible and unchangeable
According to this model there are three types of consumption: past, present and future.

When making decisions between present and future consumption, the consumer takes his/her previous consumption into account. 

This decision making is based on an indifference map with negative slope because if he consumes something today it means that he can&#x27;t consume it in the future and vice versa.

The revenue is in form of interest rate. Nominal interest rate - inflation = real interest rate

Denote
* formula_1 : interest rate
* formula_2 : income in time formula_3 or a future income 
* formula_4 : income in time formula_5 or a present income

Then maximum present consumption is: formula_6

The maximum future consumption is: formula_7

<doc id="221300" wikidata="Q582694" url="?curid=221300" title="Dion Boucicault">
<text>Dionysius Lardner &quot;Dion&quot; Boucicault (nÃ© Boursiquot; 26 December 1820 â 18 September 1890) was an Irish actor and playwright famed for his melodramas. By the later part of the 19th century, Boucicault had become known on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the most successful actor-playwright-managers then in the English-speaking theatre. &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed him in his obituary as &quot;the most conspicuous English dramatist of the 19th century,&quot;; he and his second wife, Agnes Robertson Boucicault, applied for and received American citizenship in 1873.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Boucicault was born Dionysius Lardner Boursiquot in 1820 Dublin, where his family lived on Gardiner Street. His mother was Anne Maria Laura Beresford, sister of the poet and mathematician George Darley. The Darleys were an important Anglo-Irish Dublin family influential in many fields and related to the Guinnesses by marriage. Anne was married to Samuel Smith Boursiquot, of Huguenot ancestry, but the identity of Dion&#x27;s father is uncertain. He was probably Dionysius Lardner, who was a lodger at Anne Boursiquot&#x27;s house at a time when she had recently separated from her husband. Lardner later gave Dion Boucicault financial support until about 1840.

In 1828, Lardner was elected as professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at University College, London, a position he held until he resigned in 1831. Anne Boursiquot followed him to London in 1828, taking all but one of her children with her. 

Consequently, Dion Boucicault attended various schools in and around London; there is confusion about the details of his education. Richard Fawkes has addressed this in a biography. For about four years, from 1829, Boucicault seems to have attended a very small private school in Hampstead kept by a Mr Hessey; between 1833 and 1835 he was at University College School, where he began his friendship with Charles Kenney. He later recalled having boarded in Euston Square with a Rev. Henry Stebbing, a historian. There is a gap of two years in the record, when Fawkes believes Boucicault may have attended Rowland Hill&#x27;s Bruce Castle School, as stated in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

In 1837, he was enrolled at Wyke House, a school at Sion Hill, Brentford, kept by a Dr Alexander Jamieson. There he appeared in a school play, in the part of Rolla in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;Pizarro&quot;. He also wrote his own first play, &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, which was produced some years later.

When Boucicault was in his late teens, his mother persuaded a cousin, Arthur Lee Guinness, to give her son a job as a clerk in the Dublin brewery. He began an affair with Guinness, which caused a crisis in his cousin&#x27;s family. In 1840 Boucicault returned to London flush with cash, thought to be the result of blackmail or the family having paid him off. He enrolled as a student at the Dean Street Academy. He later claimed Guinness paid for his tuition and had made him his heir. The allowance was stopped and Boucicault became penniless.

===Work as actor and playwright===
Boucicault took up an acting offer in Cheltenham, adopting the stage name of Lee Morton. He joined William Charles Macready and made his first appearance on stage with Benjamin Webster at Bristol. Soon after this he began to write plays, occasionally in conjunction with his acting.

Boucicault&#x27;s first play, &quot;A Legend of the Devil&#x27;s Dyke&quot;, opened in Brighton in 1838. Three years later, he had a big success as a dramatist with &quot;London Assurance&quot;. First produced at Covent Garden on 4 March 1841, its cast included such well-known actors as Charles Mathews, William Farren, Mrs Nesbitt and Madame Vestris.
Boucicault rapidly followed this with a number of other plays, among the most successful being &quot;The Bastile&quot; , an &quot;after-piece&quot; (1842), &quot;Old Heads and Young Hearts&quot; (1844), &quot;The School for Scheming&quot; (1847), &quot;Confidence&quot; (1848), and &quot;The Knight Arva&quot; (1848), all produced at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. He had further great successes with &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1852, for Charles Kean) and &quot;Louis XI&quot; (1855), both adaptations of French plays.

In his &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1852), Boucicault made his dÃ©but as a leading actor, appearing as the vampire Sir Alan Raby. Although the play received mixed reviews, Boucicault&#x27;s characterisation was praised as &quot;a dreadful and weird thing played with immortal genius&quot;. In 1854 he wrote &quot;Andy Blake; or, The Irish Diamond&quot; and also played the title character.

From 1854 to 1860, Boucicault resided in the United States, where he was always a popular favourite. Boucicault and his actress wife, Agnes Robertson, toured America. He also wrote many successful plays there, acting in most of them. These included the popular &quot;Jessie Brown; or, The Relief of Lucknow&quot; in 1858.

===Work as theatre manager and producer===
From around 1855 his business manager and partner in New York was William Stuart, an expatriate Irish MP and adventurer. Together they leased Wallack&#x27;s Theatre in 1855â1856, and put on a short season at the Washington Theatre in Washington D.C.

In late 1855, while his wife was performing in St. Louis, Boucicault became the lessee of the Varieties Theatre in New Orleans. He quickly renamed it the Gaity and was set to open its doors on the 28th of November. A short delay pushed the opening night back to December 1 with his play &quot;Used Up&quot;. During his stay in New Orleans, a false report of his death began to circulate, this rumor was proven false when days later on December 20 he presented &quot;The Chameleon&quot; at the Gaiety. This was the first appearance of Agnes Robertson at the Gaiety. Shortly after, on February 26 of 1856 Boucicualt was in the market to sell his lease. By March 8 he was out and heading to New York.

In the summer of 1859, Boucicault and William Stuart became joint lessees of Burton&#x27;s New Theatre (originally Tripler&#x27;s Theatre) on Broadway just below Amity Street. After extensive remodeling, he renamed his new showplace the Winter Garden Theatre. There on 5 December 1859, he premiered his new sensation, the anti-slavery potboiler &quot;The Octoroon&quot;, in which he also starred. This is considered the first play to explore the lives of the Black American population, the majority of whom were still enslaved.

Boucicault fell out with Stuart over money matters, and he returned to England. There he produced at the Adelphi Theatre a dramatic adaptation of Gerald Griffin&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Collegians&quot;, entitled &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot;. This play, one of the most successful of the times, was performed in almost every city of the United Kingdom and the United States. Julius Benedict used it as the basis for his opera &quot;The Lily of Killarney&quot;. Although the play earned a handsome fortune for Boucicault, he lost it while managing various London theatres.

After returning to England, Boucicault was asked by noted American comedian Joseph Jefferson, who also starred in the production of &quot;Octoroon&quot;, to rework Jefferson&#x27;s adaptation of Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Rip van Winkle&quot;. Their play opened in London in 1865 and on Broadway in 1866.

Boucicault&#x27;s next marked success was at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London in 1864 with &quot;Arrah-na-Pogue&quot; in which he played the part of a County Wicklow, Ireland carman. This, and his admirable creation of &quot;Conn&quot; in his play &quot;The Shaughraun&quot; (first produced at Wallacks Theatre, New York City, in 1874, then at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1875), won him the reputation of being the best &quot;Stage Irishman&quot; of his time. W. S. Gilbert referred to the notable actor in the libretto of his 1881 operetta &quot;Patience&quot; in the line: &quot;The pathos of Paddy, as rendered by Boucicault&quot;.

Again in partnership with William Stuart, he built the New Park Theatre in 1873â1874. However, Boucicault withdrew from the business just before the theatre opened. Stuart teamed up instead with the actor, playwright and theatre manager Charles Fechter to run the house.

In 1875 Boucicault returned to New York City, where he made his home; for a time his manager was Harry J. Sargent. He wrote the melodrama &quot;Contempt of Court&quot; (poster, left) in 1879, but he paid occasional visits to London and elsewhere (e.g. Toronto). He made his last appearance in London in his play, &quot;The Jilt&quot;, in 1885.

Boucicault was an excellent actor, especially in pathetic parts. His uncanny ability to play these low-status roles earned him the nickname &quot;Little Man Dion&quot; in theatrical circles. His plays are for the most part adaptations, but are often very ingenious in construction. They have had great popularity.

===Family life===
Boucicault was married three times. He married the much older Anne Guiot at St Mary-at-Lambeth on 9 July 1845. He claimed that she died in a Swiss mountaineering accident later in the same year, though she may in fact have died as late as 1848. In 1853, he eloped with Agnes Kelly Robertson (1833â1916) to marry in New York. She was Charles Kean&#x27;s ward; the juvenile lead in his company and an actress of unusual ability. She would bear Dion six children: Dion William Boucicault (1855â1876); Eva Boucicault (1857â1909); Dion Jr. (1859â1929); Patrice Boucicault (1862â1890); Nina Boucicault (1867â1950); Aubrey (1868â1913); three of whom became distinguished actors in their own right. Patrice became a society singer, marrying George Pitman in 1885 but died in childbirth in 1890. His granddaughter Rene Boucicault (1898â1935), Aubrey&#x27;s daughter, became an actress and acted in silent films. His oldest son was killed in the Abbots Ripton rail accident on the East Coast Main Line in England in 1876.

Between 11 July and 8 October 1885, Boucicault toured Australia, where his brother Arthur lived. Towards the end of this tour, he suddenly left Agnes to marry Josephine Louise Thorndyke (c. 1864â1956), a young actress, on 9 September 1885, in Sydney. This aroused scandal on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, as his marriage to Agnes was not finally dissolved until 21 June 1888, by reason of &quot;bigamy with adultery.&quot; The rights to many of his plays were later sold to finance alimony payments to his second wife.

His last play, &quot;A Tale of a Coat&quot;, opened at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in New York on 14 August 1890, and closed on 13 September 1890.

Boucicault died in 1890 in New York City, and was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Hastings, Westchester County, New York.

<text>William Farren (13 May 1786 â 24 September 1861) was an English actor, who was the son of the actor of the same name (born 1754), who played leading roles from 1784 to 1795 at Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.

==Life==
Raised on Gower Street in London, he was raised in comparative affluence, supported not only by his father&#x27;s wealth but also by a large gift from surgeon Percival Pott. He attended school in Soho and may have apprenticed as an attorney in Wolverhampton; by 1806, however, he had joined his brother Percy&#x27;s troupe in Plymouth. His first appearance on the stage was at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth in Charles Macklin&#x27;s &quot;Love Ã  la mode&quot;. From the beginning he specialized in comic old men and Irish parts. A decade of provincial apprenticeship followed in southern England and in Dublin (where he married); his first roles included Adam Contest in Elizabeth Inchbald&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Day&quot; and Lovegold in Henry Fielding&#x27;s translation of MoliÃ¨re&#x27;s &quot;The Miser&quot;; however, his name is associated with a wide variety of roles.

His first London appearance was in 1818 at Covent Garden as Sir Peter Teazle (in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;), a part with which his name was always associated: he was an instant popular and critical success. He succeeded also in Colman and Garrick&#x27;s &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot;.

He played at Covent Garden every winter until 1828, and began in 1824 a series of summer engagements at the Haymarket which also lasted some years. At these two theatres he played an immense variety of comedic characters. After 1821, he separated from his first wife and began living with Harriet Elizabeth Savill, who was at the time married to John Saville Faucit. After an unsuccessful attempt to annul the marriage, Farren and Savill lived together under common law marriage, though they did not marry formally until Saville&#x27;s death in 1853. Farren and his brother played important roles in training Savill&#x27;s daughter, Helen Faucit, for her successful acting career.

From 1828 until 1837 he was at Drury Lane, where he essayed a wider range of characters, including Polonius and Caesar. He was again at Covent Garden for a few years, where he continued to expand his repertoire. Apart from an unsuccessful turn as Shylock, he attempted female roles such as Meg Merrilies in a dramatization of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;.

In fall of 1837, he joined the troupe run by Lucia Elizabeth Vestris at the Olympic Theatre, and he stayed with Vestris during her management of Covent Garden, ending in 1842. His most notable new role during this period was as Sir Harcourt Courtly in Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;London Assurance&quot;.

He next joined Benjamin Webster at the Haymarket as stage-manager as well as actor. Now nearly sixty, he succeeded in two notable old-men roles by Mark Lemon: the title characters in &quot;Grandfather Whitehead&quot; and &quot;Old Parr&quot;. His performance as Thomas Parr was praised by &quot;The Times&quot; as a breakthrough in English acting. He was performing in that role in 1843 when he suffered an on-stage stroke. He was, however, able to reappear the following year, and he remained at the Haymarket ten years more, though his acting never again reached its former level; Edward Dutton Cook recalls an 1851 performance in which Farren, though &quot;acting admirably&quot;, did not utter a single intelligible word.

For a time he managed the Strand, and between 1850 and 1853, was lessee of the Olympic. During his later years he confined himself to parts portraying old men, in which he was unrivalled. In 1855 he made his final appearance at the Haymarket, as Lord Ogleby in a scene from the &quot;Clandestine Marriage&quot;.

With Faucit, he left two sons, Henry (1826â1860) and William (1825â1908), both actors. The former was the father of Nellie Farren, long famous for boy&#x27;s parts in Gaiety musical burlesques, in the days of Edward Terry and Fred Leslie. As Jack Sheppard, and in similar roles, she had a unique position at the Gaiety, and was an unrivalled public favourite. In 1892 her health failed, and her retirement, coupled with Fred Leslie&#x27;s death, brought to an end the type of Gaiety burlesque associated with them.

==Art and reputation==
In the types of characters he favored, &quot;crusty old bachelors, jealous old husbands, stormy fathers, worrying uncles, or ancient fops with ghastly pretensions to amiability&quot; (as Lewes described them), he was among the most highly regarded actors of his time. His performances were known for their polish and subtlety; in more sentimental roles, such as Old Parr, he was able to mix sentiment with cool irony. He was at home in Augustan and other eighteenth century roles, but he is not remembered as a Shakespearian actor. Macready remembered him as justly famous for &quot;studious correctness&quot;, but described him as second to William Dowton and Joseph Munden in &quot;the rich quality of humor.&quot; William Hazlitt praised the conservatism of his style in the older plays. Leigh Hunt disagreed, disparaging Farren in favor of Dowton as Anthony Absolute (Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot;). Even Hunt, though, acknowledged Farren&#x27;s exceptional self-possession. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1855, Henry Morley called Farren &quot;one of the most finished actors by whom the stage has been adorned in the present century.&quot; Writing after the actor&#x27;s death, John Westland Marston recalls that the actor excelled in portraying &quot;the vanity, the self-love, the inconsistency, and now and then the redeeming good-feeling of worldly, well-bred people, and occasionally the credulous faith of simple, guileless people.&quot;

<text>Edward O&#x27;Connor Terry (10 March 1844 â 2 April 1912) was an English actor, who became one of the most influential actors and comedians of the Victorian era.

==Early life and career==
Terry was born in London, allegedly the illegitimate son of Feargus O&#x27;Connor, Irish Chartist leader and advocate of the land plan. The younger Terry made his debut in 1863 as Wormwood in &quot;The Lottery Ticket&quot;. He began his stage career in small companies in the provinces playing in Shakespeare with the young Henry Irving and sometimes in pieces employing his singing talents.

==Peak years==

In 1867, Terry played for a season at London&#x27;s Surrey Theatre in both comedy and drama. Between 1868 and 1875, he was the leading comedian at the Royal Strand Theatre in London. He reached the peak of his popularity after he joined John Hollingshead&#x27;s company at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1876, starring in the musical burlesques produced there during the next eight years. With Nellie Farren, Kate Vaughan and E. W. Royce, he made the fortune of this house, his eccentric acting and singing creating a style which had many imitators. Some of the roles in which he appeared there included Mephistopheles in &quot;Little Doctor Faust&quot; (1878).
In 1887 he went into management, opening Terry&#x27;s Theatre, built on the site of the old Coal Hole public house and music hall on the Strand. There, he produced and starred as Dick Phenyl in Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Lavender&quot;, which was perhaps his greatest success, running for 670 nights. He then revived Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Magistrate&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. In subsequent years, he was only occasionally seen at his own theatre and made many tours in the British provinces and in Australia, North and South America, South Africa and India. He returned to Terry&#x27;s in 1890, producing and starring in &quot;King Kodak&quot;, &quot;The Blue Boar&quot; and several other notable productions. Terry brought four plays to New York in 1904. In this, his only Broadway engagement, he and his touring company played the former Princess Theatre on West 29th St. for eight weeks from December 1904 to February 1905, in &quot;The House of Burnside&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lavender&quot;, &quot;Love in Idleness&quot;, and &quot;The Passport&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Terry married twice; his first marriage was to Ellen Deitz in 1870. He married his second wife, Florence, Lady Harris, widow of Augustus Harris, in 1904. Off the stage, he was a Freemason and served on the councils of many charities and of public bodies.

Terry died of neuritis at his home in Barnes, England, at the age of 68.

<doc id="221308" wikidata="Q1602656" url="?curid=221308" title="Self-assessment">
<text>In social psychology, self-assessment is the process of looking at oneself in order to assess aspects that are important to one&#x27;s identity. It is one of the motives that drive self-evaluation, along with self-verification and self-enhancement. Sedikides (1993) suggests that the self-assessment motive will prompt people to seek information to confirm their uncertain self-concept rather than their certain self-concept and at the same time people use self-assessment to enhance their certainty of their own self-knowledge. However, the self-assessment motive could be seen as quite different from the other two self-evaluation motives. Unlike the other two motives, through self-assessment people are interested in the accuracy of their current self view, rather than improving their self-view. This makes self-assessment the only self-evaluative motive that may cause a person&#x27;s self-esteem to be damaged.

== Functions ==

If through self-assessing there is a possibility that a person&#x27;s self-concept, or self-esteem is going to be damaged why would this be a motive of self-evaluation, surely it would be better to only self-verify and self-enhance and not to risk damaging self-esteem? Trope in a 1986 paper suggests that self-assessment is a way in which self-esteem can be enhanced in the future. For example, self-assessment may mean that in the short-term self-assessment may cause harm to a person&#x27;s self-concept through realising that they may not have achieved as highly as they may like; however in the long term this may mean that they work harder in order to achieve greater things in the future, and as a result their self-esteem would be enhanced further than where it had been before self-assessment.

Within the self-evaluation motives however there are some interesting interactions. Self-assessment is found a lot of the time to be associated with self-enhancement as the two motives seem to contradict each other with opposing aims; whereas the motive to self-assess sees it as important to ensure that the self-concept is accurate the motive to self-enhance sees it as important to boost the self-concept in order to protect it from any negative feedback.

== Research ==
In 1993, Constantine Sedikides performed an experiment investigating the roles of each of the self-evaluation motives, investigated if one was stronger and held more weight than others and tried to draw out specifically the self-assessment and self-verification motives. The first experiment conducted the results showed that when choosing what questions they wanted to be asked they were more likely to request those that would verify their self-concept rather than assess it. This finding supports the idea that certain traits are more central to a person&#x27;s self-concept, however shows little support for the self-assessment motive. When considering the interaction between how strong and how central certain traits are to a person&#x27;s self-concept Sedikides again found evidence in support of the self-verification and self-enhancement motives, though again none for the self-assessment motive.

The second experiment conducted by Sedikides (1993) investigated the possibility that the ability for greater reflection than experiment one may show greater levels of self-assessment in the participants. However the results of this experiment showed that though through some analysis there was evidence of some self-verification there was no real evidence pointing towards self-assessment and all the results supported self-enhancement. The third experiment again tried to draw out evidence for self-verification and self-assessment and though, as with experiment two, there was some evidence to support the self-verification motive most of the results pointed towards the self-enhancement method and not self-assessment.

In experiment four Sedikides suggests that the reason past experiments have not supported self-assessment is because participants reflect more on the central traits than peripheral traits, which are generally ones that are assessed so as to be able to improve at the same time as not harming the self-concept too much. This experiment therefore looked at whether this was true and whether it was the central traits that were being looked at in this study rather than peripheral. The results showed exactly what Sedikides expected, though because of this the results of the other parts of the experiment gave support to the self-enhancement motive rather than self-assessment of self-verification.

The fifth experiment carried out by Sedikides suggests that in the past experiments the possibility of self-assessing was less likely than self-verification or self-enhancement as the participants would not have been objective in their self-evaluation. For this experiment therefore the experimental group were asked to approach their reflections in an objective way, as if they were approaching their self-concept as a scientist, bringing each of their traits under scrutiny. Results of this study showed that those subjects who were asked to be objective in their assessment strove more for accuracy than those not asked to be specifically objective. The authors then conducted one final experiment looking at the validation of self-enhancement when reflecting on the self.

Sedikides and Strube (1997) reviewed past research into the self-assessment motive and looked at whether participants would be more attracted to tasks that were high or low in accuracy about their characteristics, whether they would choose to take part in tasks that were more or less accurate and if they would prefer to create highly or less accurate tasks. This review showed that people are more attracted to taking part in tasks that are more accurate about them than those that are less accurate and would prefer to take part in higher accuracy tests. However, when only being asked if they would like to take part in high or low accuracy tasks does not give a complete accurate view of self-assessment; if there is no threat of actually taking part in the tasks the participants may not be as honest as if they actually had to take part. Brown therefore showed that self-assessment is can be seen when participants are asked to actually take part in tasks that will be high in their accuracy or low in their accuracy of a person&#x27;s characteristics. This research found that participants were more likely to choose to take part in tasks that were higher in accuracy about their characteristics. The last area of self-assessment Sedikides and Strube reviewed was whether participants would want to construct highly or less accurate tasks and if participants would be more persistent or more likely to succeed if they were taking part in highly or less accurate tasks. The review showed that participants would prefer to make highly accurate tasks which measured their abilities; however they will be more persistent in tasks which are lower in accuracy. The review also showed though that participants were more likely to succeed on tasks that they were told were high in accuracy. It is suggested that this is because when completing tasks that are highly accurate about a person&#x27;s characteristics there is more to gain from succeeding in a task as it will therefore give more information about the person&#x27;s characteristics than if it was low in accuracy.

Though self-assessment is one of the self-evaluation motives it could be suggested that it may not be the most popular one. Self-enhancement was displayed in each of the experiments conducted by Sedikides and self-assessment, and even self-verification to an extent was only displayed when it was teased out. This is not to say that self-assessment is not a self-evaluation motive, however most of the experiments conducted by Sedikides ended up with the participants reflecting on central traits rather than peripheral traits. This is unsurprising as they are the most important traits to a person&#x27;s self-concept, however it is not therefore surprising that these are the traits that are enhanced rather than assessed as if someone assessed their central traits and found fault it would be more of an issue than finding a fault with a peripheral trait. The fifth experiment carried out by Sedikides shows that self-assessment does exist and is one of the self-evaluation motives; if people didn&#x27;t self-assess then even in this experiment there would have been no difference between the reflections of those asked to be objective and those who were not. Self-assessment is a difficult motive to assess, as discovered by Sedikides but it is important to self-evaluation as it means that people are able to realize ways in which to improve themselves.

<text>Benjamin Nottingham Webster (3 September 17973 July 1882) was an English actor-manager and dramatist.

== Early life ==
Webster was born in Bath, the son of a dancing master.

== Career ==

First appearing as Harlequin, and then in small parts at Drury Lane, he went to the Haymarket Theatre in 1829, and was given leading comedy character business.

Webster was the lessee of the Haymarket from 1837 to 1853; he built the new Adelphi Theatre (1859); later the Olympic Theatre, Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London and St James&#x27;s Theatres came under his control; and he was the patron of all the contemporary playwrights and many of the best actors, who owed their opportunity of success to him. He wrote, translated or adapted nearly a hundred plays.

As a character actor he was unequalled in his day, especially in such parts as Triplet in &quot;Masks and Faces&quot;, Joey Ladle in &quot;No Thoroughfare&quot;, and John Peerybingle in his own dramatization of &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot;.

Webster took his formal farewell of the stage in 1874.

== Later life ==
Webster died in 1882, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. The grave lies 10m east of the main path, midway between the north entrance and the colonnades on an eastâwest path.

== Personal life ==
His daughter, Harriette Georgiana (died 1897), was the first wife of Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham.

His son, W.S. Webster, had three children â Benjamin Webster (b. 1864; married to Miss (Dame) May Whitty), Annie (Mrs A.E. George) and Lizzie (Mrs Sydney Brough) â all well known on the London stage, and further connected with it in each case by marriage.

<doc id="221312" wikidata="Q222951" url="?curid=221312" title="Junglefowl">
<text>Junglefowl are the only four living species of bird from the genus Gallus in the bird order Galliformes, and occur in parts of South and Southeast Asia. One of the species in this genus, the red junglefowl, is of historical importance as the direct ancestor of the domestic chicken, although the grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl are likely to have also been involved. The Sri Lankan junglefowl is the national bird of Sri Lanka. They diverged from their common ancestor about 4â6 million years ago. Although originating in Asia, remains of junglefowl bones have also been found in regions of Chile, which date back to 1321â1407Â CE, providing evidence of possible Polynesian migration through the Pacific Ocean.

The junglefowl are omnivorous, eating a variety of leaves, plant matter, invertebrates such as slugs and insects, and occasionally small mice and frogs. These are large birds, with colourful plumage in males, but are nevertheless difficult to see in the dense vegetation they inhabit.

As with many birds in the pheasant family, the male takes no part in the incubation of the egg or rearing of the precocial young. These duties are performed by the drab and well-camouflaged female. Females and males do not form pair bonds; instead, the species has a polygynandrous mating system in which each female will usually mate with several males. Aggressive social hierarchies exist among both females and males, from which the term &quot;pecking order&quot; originates.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Gallus&quot; was erected by the French scientist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; published in 1760. The type species is the red junglefowl (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;). The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had introduced the genus &quot;Gallus&quot; in the 6th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; published in 1748, but Linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of 1758 and put the red junglefowl together with the common pheasant in the genus &quot;Phasianus&quot;. However, the red junglefowl and common pheasant are now known to have diverged about 18â23 million years ago, and belong to different subfamilies. This pairwise divergence time was also the same between the other three junglefowls and the pheasant. As the publication date of Linnaeus&#x27;s sixth edition was before the 1758 starting point of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, Brisson and not Linnaeus is considered as the authority for the genus.

More recent phylogenetic evidence supports the closest relatives of &quot;Gallus&quot; being the bamboo partridges in the genus &quot;Bambusicola&quot;, from which they diverged about 15 million years ago.

===Extant species===
The genus contains four species.

Prehistorically, the genus &quot;Gallus&quot; was found all over Eurasia; in fact, it appears to have evolved in southeastern Europe. Several fossil species have been described, but their distinctness is not firmly established in all cases:
* &quot;Gallus aesculapii&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Greece) - possibly belongs into &quot;Pavo&quot;
* &quot;Gallus moldovicus&quot; (Late Pliocene of Moldavia) - sometimes misspelt &quot;moldavicus&quot;, may be synonym of &quot;Pavo bravardi&quot;
* &quot;Gallus beremendensis&quot; (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene of Eastern Europe)
* Giant junglefowl &quot;Gallus karabachensis&quot; (Early Pleistocene of Nagorno-Karabakh)
* &quot;Gallus tamanensis&quot; (Early Pleistocene? of Taman Peninsula)
* &quot;Gallus kudarensis&quot; (Early/Middle Pleistocene of Kudaro, South Ossetia)
* &quot;Gallus europaeus&quot; (Middle Pleistocene of Italy)
* &quot;Gallus&quot; sp. (Middle/Late Pleistocene of Trinka Cave, Moldavia)
* &quot;Gallus imereticus&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Gvardjilas-Klde, Imeretia)
* &quot;Gallus meschtscheriensis&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Soungir, Russia)
* &quot;Gallus georgicus&quot; (Late Pleistocene - Early Holocene of Georgia)

<text>The Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site consists of seven contiguous parks including four national parks (Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, and Yoho) and three British Columbia provincial parks (Hamber, Mount Assiniboine, and Mount Robson).

These seven parks in the Canadian Rockies include mountains, glaciers, and hot springs and the headwaters of major North American river systems including the North Saskatchewan, Athabasca, Columbia, and Fraser rivers.

The area is known for its natural environment and biological diversity. It includes the Burgess Shale site, a World Heritage Site in its own right from 1980 to 1984, when it was included in the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks WHS designation.

==World Heritage Site==

In 1983 Canada nominated Banff, Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho national parks for inclusion on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. UNESCO accepted this nomination in 1984 on the basis of a recommendation by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The original nomination and IUCN&#x27;s recommendation drew attention to the area&#x27;s &quot;exceptional natural beauty&quot;, &quot;habitats of rare and endangered species&quot; and its natural landforms such as mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, canyons, limestone caves, and the unique Burgess Shale fossils. That year the UNESCO World Heritage Committee &quot;requested the Canadian authorities to consider adding the adjacent Provincial Parks of Mount Robson, Hamber, Mount Assiniboine and Kananaskis&quot; to the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks site. At a 1990 meeting, &quot;the Committee welcomed the Canadian proposal to include, in the Rocky Mountains Parks site, Mount Robson, Hamber and Assiniboine Provincial Parks, following its request at its Eighth Session in 1984.&quot; Kananaskis (renamed Peter Lougheed Provincial Park) has not been included within the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage site.

<doc id="221315" wikidata="Q221269" url="?curid=221315" title="North American X-15">
<text>The North American X-15 is a hypersonic rocket-powered aircraft which was operated by the United States Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the X-plane series of experimental aircraft. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the 1960s, crossing the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design. The X-15&#x27;s highest speed, , was achieved on 3October 1967, when William J. Knight flew at Mach6.7 at an altitude of , or 19.34miles. This set the official world record for the highest speed ever recorded by a crewed, powered aircraft, which remains unbroken.

During the X-15 program, 12pilots flew a combined 199flights. Of these, 8pilots flew a combined 13flights which met the Air Force spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of , thus qualifying these pilots as being astronauts; of those 13flights, two (flown by the same civilian pilot) met the FAI definition () of outer space. The 5Air Force pilots qualified for military astronaut wings immediately, while the 3civilian pilots were eventually awarded NASA astronaut wings in 2005, 35years after the last X-15 flight.

==Design and development==
The X-15 was based on a concept study from Walter Dornberger for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) of a hypersonic research aircraft. The requests for proposal (RFPs) were published on 30December 1954 for the airframe and on 4February 1955 for the rocket engine. The X-15 was built by two manufacturers: North American Aviation was contracted for the airframe in November 1955, and Reaction Motors was contracted for building the engines in 1956.

Like many X-series aircraft, the X-15 was designed to be carried aloft and drop launched from under the wing of a B-52 mother ship. Air Force NB-52A, &quot;The High and Mighty One&quot; (serial 52-0003), and NB-52B, &quot;The Challenger&quot; (serial 52-0008, also known as &quot;Balls 8&quot;) served as carrier planes for all X-15 flights. Release of the X-15 from NB-52A took place at an altitude of about (45,000 feet) and a speed of about . The X-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical, with rear fairings that flattened its appearance, and thick, dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers. Parts of the fuselage (the outer skin) were heat-resistant nickel alloy (Inconel-X750). The retractable landing gear comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skids. The skids did not extend beyond the ventral fin, which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin just before landing. The lower fin was recovered by parachute.

===Cockpit and pilot systems===
The X-15 was the product of developmental research, and changes were made to various systems over the course of the program and between the different models. The X-15 was operated under several different scenarios, including attachment to a launch aircraft, drop, main engine start and acceleration, ballistic flight into thin air/space, re-entry into thicker air, unpowered glide to landing, and direct landing without a main-engine start. The main rocket engine operated only for a relatively short part of the flight but boosted the X-15 to its high speeds and altitudes. Without the main rocket engine thrust, the X-15&#x27;s instruments and control surfaces remained functional, but the aircraft could not maintain altitude.

As the X-15 also had to be controlled in an environment where there was too little air for aerodynamic flight control surfaces, it had a reaction control system (RCS) that used rocket thrusters. There were two different X-15 pilot control setups: one used three joysticks, the other, one joystick.

The X-15 type with multiple control sticks for the pilot placed a traditional center stick between a left 3-axis joystick that sent commands to the Reaction Control System, and a third joystick on the right used during high-G maneuvers to augment the center stick. In addition to pilot input, the X-15 &quot;Stability Augmentation System&quot; (SAS) sent inputs to the aerodynamic controls to help the pilot maintain attitude control. The Reaction Control System (RCS) could be operated in two modesÂ â manual and automatic. The automatic mode used a feature called &quot;Reaction Augmentation System&quot; (RAS) that helped stabilize the vehicle at high altitude. The RAS was typically used for approximately three minutes of an X-15 flight before automatic power off.

The alternative control setup used the MH-96 flight control system, which allowed one joystick in place of three and simplified pilot input. The MH-96 could automatically blend aerodynamic and rocket controls, depending on how effective each system was at controlling the aircraft.

Among the many controls were the rocket engine throttle and a control for jettisoning the ventral tail fin. Other features of the cockpit included heated windows to prevent icing and a forward headrest for periods of high deceleration.

The X-15 had an ejection seat designed to operate at speeds up to and/or (23 miles) altitude, although it was never used during the program. In the event of ejection, the seat was designed to deploy fins, which were used until it reached a safer speed/altitude at which to deploy its main parachute. Pilots wore pressure suits, which could be pressurized with nitrogen gas. Above altitude, the cockpit was pressurized to with nitrogen gas, while oxygen for breathing was fed separately to the pilot.

===Propulsion===
The initial 24 powered flights used two Reaction Motors XLR11 liquid-propellant rocket engines, enhanced to provide a total of of thrust as compared to the that a single XLR11 provided in 1947 to make the Bell X-1 the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound. The XLR11 used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen.

By November 1960, Reaction Motors delivered the XLR99 rocket engine, generating of thrust. The remaining 175flights of the X-15 used XLR99 engines, in a single engine configuration. The XLR99 used anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen as propellant, and hydrogen peroxide to drive the high-speed turbopump that delivered propellants to the engine. It could burn of propellant in 80seconds; Jules Bergman titled his book on the program &quot;Ninety Seconds to Space&quot; to describe the total powered flight time of the aircraft.

The X-15 reaction control system (RCS), for maneuvering in the low-pressure/density environment, used high-test peroxide (HTP), which decomposes into water and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst and could provide a specific impulse of . The HTP also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs). Additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions; the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas, and liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.

===Wedge tail and hypersonic stability===
The X-15 had a thick wedge tail to enable it to fly in a steady manner at hypersonic speeds. This produced a significant amount of base drag at lower speeds; the blunt end at the rear of the X-15 could produce as much drag as an entire F-104 Starfighter.
 Stability at hypersonic speeds was aided by side panels that could be extended from the tail to increase the overall surface area, and these panels doubled as air brakes.

==Operational history==
Before 1958, United States Air Force (USAF) and NACA officials discussed an orbital X-15 spaceplane, the X-15B that would launch into outer space from atop an SM-64 Navaho missile. This was canceled when the NACA became NASA and adopted Project Mercury instead.

By 1959, the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar space-glider program was to become the USAF&#x27;s preferred means for launching military crewed spacecraft into orbit. This program was canceled in the early 1960s before an operational vehicle could be built. Various configurations of the Navaho were considered, and another proposal involved a Titan I stage.

Three X-15s were built, flying 199test flights, the last on 24October 1968.

The first X-15 flight was an unpowered glide flight by Scott Crossfield, on 8June 1959. Crossfield also piloted the first powered flight on 17September 1959, and his first flight with the XLR-99 rocket engine on 15November 1960. Twelve test pilots flew the X-15. Among these were Neil Armstrong, later a NASA astronaut and the first man to set foot on the Moon, and Joe Engle, later a commander of NASA Space Shuttle missions.

In a 1962 proposal, NASA considered using the B-52/X-15 as a launch platform for a Blue Scout rocket to place satellites weighing up to into orbit.

In July and August 1963, pilot Joe Walker exceeded in altitude, joining NASA astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts as the first human beings to cross that line on their way to outer space. The USAF awarded astronaut wings to anyone achieving an altitude of , while the FAI set the limit of space at .

On 15November 1967, U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Michael J. Adams was killed during X-15 Flight 191 when X-15-3, , entered a hypersonic spin while descending, then oscillated violently as aerodynamic forces increased after re-entry. As his aircraft&#x27;s flight control system operated the control surfaces to their limits, acceleration built to vertical and lateral. The airframe broke apart at altitude, scattering the X-15&#x27;s wreckage across . On 8May 2004, a monument was erected at the cockpit&#x27;s locale, near Johannesburg, California. Major Adams was posthumously awarded Air Force astronaut wings for his final flight in X-15-3, which had reached an altitude of . In 1991, his name was added to the Astronaut Memorial.

The second plane, X-15-2, was rebuilt after a landing accident on 9November 1962 which damaged the craft and injured its pilot, John McKay. The new plane renamed X-15A-2, had a new 28 -in. fuselage extension to carry liquid hydrogen. It was lengthened by , had a pair of auxiliary fuel tanks attached beneath its fuselage and wings, and a complete heat-resistant ablative coating was added. It took flight for the first time on 25June 1964. It reached its maximum speed of in October 1967 with pilot William &quot;Pete&quot; Knight of the U.S. Air Force in control.

Five principal aircraft were used during the X-15 program: three X-15 planes and two modified &quot;nonstandard&quot; NB-52 bombers:
* &quot;56-6670&quot;, 81 free flights
* &quot;56-6671&quot;, 31 free flights as X-15-2, 22 free flights as X-15A-2; 53 in total
* &quot;56-6672&quot;, 65 free flights, including the Flight 191 disaster
* &quot;52-003&quot; nicknamed &quot;The High and Mighty One&quot; (retired in October 1969)
* &quot;52-008&quot; nicknamed &quot;The Challenger&quot;, later &quot;Balls 8&quot; (retired in November 2004)

Additionally, F-100, F-104 and F5D chase aircraft and C-130 and C-47 transports supported the program.

The 200th flight over Nevada was first scheduled for 21November 1968, to be flown by William &quot;Pete&quot; Knight. Numerous technical problems and outbreaks of bad weather delayed this proposed flight six times, and it was permanently canceled on 20December 1968. This X-15 (56-6670) was detached from the B-52 and then put into indefinite storage. The aircraft was later donated to the Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum for display.

==Aircraft on display==
Both surviving X-15s are currently on display at museums in the United States. In addition, three mockups and both B-52 Stratofortresses used as motherships are on display as well.
* X-15-1 (AF Ser. No. 56-6670) is on display in the National Air and Space Museum &quot;Milestones of Flight&quot; gallery, Washington, D.C., but is currently undergoing conservation work at the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.
* X-15A-2 (AF Ser. No. 56-6671) is at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio. It was retired to the museum in October 1969. The aircraft is displayed in the museum&#x27;s Research and Development Gallery alongside other &quot;X-planes&quot;, including the Bell X-1B and Douglas X-3 Stiletto.

===Mockups===
* Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards AFB, California, United States (painted with )
* Pima Air &amp; Space Museum, adjacent to Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona (painted with )
* Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum, McMinnville, Oregon (painted with ). A full-scale wooden mockup of the X-15, it is displayed along with one of the rocket engines.

===Stratofortress mother ships===

* NB-52A (AF Ser.âNo.â52-003) is displayed at the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum adjacent to DavisâMonthan AFB in Tucson, Arizona. It launched the X-15-1 30times, the X-15-2, 11times, and the X-15-3 31times (as well as the M2-F2 four times, the HL-10 11times and the X-24A twice).
* NB-52B (AF Ser.âNo.â52-008) is on permanent display outside the north gate of Edwards AFB, California. It launched the majority of X-15 flights.

==Record flights==


===Highest flights===

During 13 of the 199 total X-15 flights, eight pilots flew above , thereby qualifying as astronauts according to the US Armed Forces definition of the space border. All five Air Force pilots flew above 50miles and were awarded military astronaut wings contemporaneously with their achievements, including Adams, who received the distinction posthumously following the flight191 disaster. However the other three were NASA employees and did not receive a comparable decoration at the time. In 2004, the Federal Aviation Administration conferred its first-ever commercial astronaut wings on Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, pilots of the commercial SpaceShipOne, another spaceplane with a flight profile comparable to the X-15&#x27;s. Following this in 2005, NASA retroactively awarded its civilian astronaut wings to Dana (then living), and to McKay and Walker (posthumously). Forrest S. Petersen, the only Navy pilot in the X-15 program, never took the aircraft above the requisite altitude and thus never earned astronaut wings.

Of the thirteen flights, only flights 90 and 91, piloted by exceeded the altitude used by the FAI to denote the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line.

<text>In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error is a cognitive attribution bias in which observers underemphasize situational and environmental factors for the behavior of an actor while overemphasizing dispositional or personality factors. In other words, observers tend to overattribute the behaviors of others to their personality (e.g., &quot;he is late because he&#x27;s selfish&quot;) and underattribute them to the situation or context (e.g., &quot;he is late because he got stuck in traffic&quot;). Although personality traits and are considered to be observable facts in psychology, the fundamental attribution error is an error because it misinterprets their effects.

The group attribution error is identical to the fundamental attribution error, where the bias is shown between members of different groups rather than different individuals.

The ultimate attribution error is a derivative of the fundamental attribution error and group attribution error relating to the actions of groups, with an additional layer of self-justification relating to whether the action of an individual is representative of the wider group.

==Origin==

=== Etymology ===
The phrase was coined by Lee Ross 10 years after an experiment by Edward E. Jones and Victor Harris in 1967. Ross argued in a popular paper that the fundamental attribution error forms the conceptual bedrock for the field of social psychology. Jones wrote that he found Ross&#x27;s phrase &quot;overly provocative and somewhat misleading&quot;, and also joked: &quot;Furthermore, I&#x27;m angry that I didn&#x27;t think of it first.&quot; Some psychologists, including Daniel Gilbert, have used the phrase &quot;correspondence bias&quot; for the fundamental attribution error. Other psychologists have argued that the fundamental attribution error and correspondence bias are related but independent phenomena, with the former being a common explanation for the latter.

===1967 demonstration study===
Jones and Harris hypothesized, based on the correspondent inference theory, that people would attribute apparently freely chosen behaviors to disposition and apparently chance-directed behaviors to situation. The hypothesis was confounded by the fundamental attribution error.

Subjects in an experiment read essays for and against Fidel Castro. Then they were asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers. When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose positions for or against Castro, they would normally rate the people who praised Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris&#x27; initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writers&#x27; positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers. The experimental group provided more internal attributions towards the writer.

== Criticism ==
The hypothesis that people systematically overattribute behavior to traits (at least for other people&#x27;s behavior) is contested. A 1986 study tested whether subjects over-, under-, or correctly estimated the empirical correlation among behaviors (i.e., traits, see &quot;trait theory&quot;). They found that estimates of correlations among behaviors correlated strongly with empirically-observed correlations among these behaviors. Subjects were sensitive to even very small correlations, and their confidence in the association tracked how far they were discrepant (i.e., if they knew when they did not know), and was higher for the strongest relations. Subjects also showed awareness of the effect of aggregation over occasions and used reasonable strategies to arrive at decisions. Epstein concluded that &quot;Far from being inveterate trait believers, as has been previously suggested, [subjects&#x27;] intuitions paralleled psychometric principles in several important respects when assessing relations between real-life behaviors.&quot;

A 2006 meta-analysis found little support for a related bias, the actorâobserver asymmetry, in which people attribute their own behavior more to the environment, but others&#x27; behavior to individual attributes. The implications for the fundamental attribution error, the author explained, were mixed. He explained that the fundamental attribution error has two versions: 

# Observers tend to explain an actor&#x27;s behavior with dispositional rather than environmental explanations;
# Observers tend to draw conclusions about an actor&#x27;s stable disposition based on the actor&#x27;s behavior in a given situation.

The author of the meta-analysis concluded that the existing weight of evidence does not support the first form of the fundamental attribution error, but does not contradict the second.

In 2015, the fundamental attribution error was contested once again in an argument against the measures originally used from the 1967 demonstration study done by Jones and Harris, and the 1982 study done by Quattrone. In this argument, the authors posed that the degree to which behaviour is constrained by a situation is a vital determinant of whether or not a dispositional attribution will be made. Since situations are undeniably complex and are of different &quot;strengths&quot;, this will interact with an individual&#x27;s disposition and determine what kind of attribution is made; although some amount of attribution can consistently be allocated to disposition, the way in which this is balanced with situational attribution will be dependent on the kind of situation one is in and the information available in said situation. The authors analyzing the 2015 study claimed that the results found in the traditional fundamental attribution error studies were &quot;interpreted as biased only because they have been compared to an inappropriate benchmark of rationality predicated on the assumption of deterministic dispositions and situations.&quot;

==Explanations==
Several theories predict the fundamental attribution error, and thus both compete to explain it, and can be falsified if it does not occur. Some examples include:
# Just-world fallacy. The belief that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get, the concept of which was first theorized by Melvin J. Lerner in 1977. Attributing failures to dispositional causes rather than situational causesâwhich are unchangeable and uncontrollableâsatisfies our need to believe that the world is fair and that we have control over our lives. We are motivated to see a just world because this reduces our perceived threats, gives us a sense of security, helps us find meaning in difficult and unsettling circumstances, and benefits us psychologically. However, the just-world fallacy also results in a tendency for people to blame and disparage victims of an accident or a tragedy, such as rape and domestic abuse, to reassure themselves of their insusceptibility to such events. People may even blame the victim&#x27;s faults in a &quot;past life&quot; to pursue justification for their bad outcome.
# Salience of the actor. We tend to attribute an observed effect to potential causes that capture our attention. When we observe other people, the person is the primary reference point while the situation is overlooked as if it is nothing but mere background. As such, attributions for others&#x27; behavior are more likely to focus on the person we see, not the situational forces acting upon that person that we may not be aware of. (When we observe ourselves, we are more aware of the forces acting upon us. Such a differential inward versus outward orientation accounts for the actorâobserver bias.)
# Lack of effortful adjustment. Sometimes, even though we are aware that the person&#x27;s behavior is constrained by situational factors, we still commit the fundamental attribution error. This is because we do not take into account behavioral and situational information simultaneously to characterize the dispositions of the actor. Initially, we use the observed behavior to characterize the person by automaticity. We need to make deliberate and conscious effort to adjust our inference by considering the situational constraints. Therefore, when situational information is not sufficiently taken into account for adjustment, the uncorrected dispositional inference creates the fundamental attribution error. This would also explain why people commit the fundamental attribution error to a greater degree when they&#x27;re under cognitive load; i.e. when they have less motivation or energy for processing the situational information.
# Culture. It has been suggested cultural differences occur in attribution error: people from individualistic (Western) cultures are reportedly more prone to the error while people from collectivistic cultures are less prone. Based on cartoon-figure presentations to Japanese and American subjects, it has been suggested that collectivist subjects may be more influenced by information from context (for instance being influenced more by surrounding faces in judging facial expressions). Alternatively, individualist subjects may favor processing of focal objects, rather than contexts. Others suggest Western individualism is associated with viewing both oneself and others as independent agents, therefore focusing more on individuals rather than contextual details. Another study found that in contrast to American children emphasizing dispositional factors to explain an event, Hindu children from India were also found to rely more on situational factors. This is due to individualistic cultures normalizing only valuing traits of each person, such as their skills, achievements, unique interests, and more. On the other hand, those in collectivistic cultures view each individual in terms of their social role, viewing them as valuable parts of a group. In these contexts, it is normalized to view decision making in terms of what benefits the larger group and aligns with social norms rather than one&#x27;s own opinion. Based on these differences, participants in these studies mostly rely on aspects learned by their respective cultures, when making attributions.

==Versus correspondence bias==

The fundamental attribution error is commonly used interchangeably with &quot;correspondence bias&quot; (sometimes called &quot;correspondence inference&quot;), although this phrase refers to a judgment which does not necessarily constitute a bias, which arises when the inference drawn is incorrect, e.g., dispositional inference when the actual cause is situational. However, there has been debate about whether the two terms should be distinguished from each other. Three main differences between these two judgmental processes have been argued:
# They seem to be elicited under different circumstances, as both correspondent dispositional inferences and situational inferences can be elicited spontaneously. Attributional processing, however, seems to only occur when the event is unexpected or conflicting with prior expectations. This notion is supported by a 1994 study, which found that different types of verbs invited different inferences and attributions. Correspondence inferences were invited to a greater degree by interpretative action verbs (such as &quot;to help&quot;) than state action or state verbs, thus suggesting that the two are produced under different circumstances.
# Correspondence inferences and causal attributions also differ in automaticity. Inferences can occur spontaneously if the behavior implies a situational or dispositional inference, while causal attributions occur much more slowly.
# It has also been suggested that correspondence inferences and causal attributions are elicited by different mechanisms. It is generally agreed that correspondence inferences are formed by going through several stages. Firstly, the person must interpret the behavior, and then, if there is enough information to do so, add situational information and revise their inference. They may then further adjust their inferences by taking into account dispositional information as well. Causal attributions however seem to be formed either by processing visual information using perceptual mechanisms, or by activating knowledge structures (e.g. schemas) or by systematic data analysis and processing. Hence, due to the difference in theoretical structures, correspondence inferences are more strongly related to behavioral interpretation than causal attributions.

Based on the preceding differences between causal attribution and correspondence inference, some researchers argue that the fundamental attribution error should be considered as the tendency to make dispositional rather than situational explanations for behavior, whereas the correspondence bias should be considered as the tendency to draw correspondent dispositional inferences from behavior. With such distinct definitions between the two, some cross-cultural studies also found that cultural differences of correspondence bias are not equivalent to those of fundamental attribution error. While the latter has been found to be more prevalent in individualistic cultures than collectivistic cultures, correspondence bias occurs across cultures, suggesting differences between the two phrases. Further, disposition correspondent inferences made to explain the behavior of nonhuman actors (e.g., robots) do not necessarily constitute an attributional error because there is little meaningful distinction between the interior dispositions and observable actions of machine agents.

== Environmental Factors ==
The fundamental attribution error is a multifaceted topic with many backgrounds of study. Some studies have looked deeper into the impacts of external environmental factors on this error, these are some of the factors researchers have found:

# Contextual Influences: The context in which automation is used plays a crucial role. Situational factors, such as the presence of guidelines or prior knowledge about the system, can shape responsibility judgments. The more control one believes they have in a situation the more likely they are to attribute responsibility to themselves.
# Cultural Values: Values such as individualism versus collectivism, can lead to different cognitive approaches, which in turn affects how judgements are made. Cultural backgrounds may have an influence on casual attribution, those raised in different cultural contexts could have varying perspectives on the causes of behavior and performance.
# Feedback Mechanisms: When individuals receive feedback on their judgments, it often serves to confirm their initial biases, leading them to continue attributing behaviors of others to internal factors rather than considering situational influences. This feedback process could create a reinforcing loop, where individuals grow more confident in their internal attributions and less likely to incorporate external factors that may offer a more accurate explanation of behavior.

<text>The Princelings (), also translated as the Party&#x27;s Crown Princes, are the descendants of prominent and influential senior communist officials in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is an informal, and often derogatory, categorization to signify those believed to be benefiting from nepotism and cronyism, by analogy with crown princes in hereditary monarchies. Many of its members hold high-level political and business positions in the upper echelons of power.

In contemporary China, &quot;Princelings&quot; are the descendants of senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders and have themselves risen to high-ranking positions within the CCP. If their parents belong to the first generation of CCP revolutionaries, they are also referred to as the &quot;second Red Generation,&quot; &quot;Red Heirs,&quot; or &quot;the Red Nobility.&quot; Princelings also encompass the sons and daughters of later generations of top leaders, including figures like Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Hu Jintao. Princelings exert their influence in the country either by occupying significant roles within the party-state apparatus, which includes the party, government, and military services, or by controlling substantial state-owned enterprises. Opportunities are available to princelings that are not available to common people. Using their powerful connections they have the opportunity to obtain profitable opportunities for themselves and for others. The more aggressive of the princelings have amassed fortunes of hundreds of millions of dollars. However, there is no discernible political cohesion within the group, and as such they should not be compared to other informal groupings such as the &quot;Shanghai clique&quot; or the &quot;Tuanpai&quot; (&quot;Youth League clique&quot;), which resemble intra-party factions with some degree of affinity on policy issues.

Under the People&#x27;s Republic, the term initially came into use during the Cultural Revolution to describe Lin Biao&#x27;s son Lin Liguo as well as his close friends and allies who had been promoted alongside him into elite positions of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force who were envisioned as the future &quot;Third Generation&quot; leadership of the CCP. Following the death of Lin Liguo in a failed coup and the subsequent purges of this group, the term briefly fell out of use until the 1980s to label the children of the Eight Elders and other First and Second Generation leaders who had been increasingly promoted in the party and were opposed to the efforts of reformers Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang to curb corruption and cronyism. Notable contemporary Princelings include Xi Jinping (son of Xi Zhongxun), China&#x27;s top leader and Party General Secretary since 2012, and Bo Xilai (son of Bo Yibo), a former Party Committee Secretary of Chongqing who was also a member of the Politburo.

In 1966, the Cultural Revolution led to many Princelings to be sent to rural China. Princelings lived in similar villages, worked together, and received their educations together. After some years, the Princelings started to return to home (commonly areas like Shanghai or Beijing) however this crucial period of time had already led many Princelings to form lifelong friendships/partnerships. The political influence of princelings has weakened during the leadership of Xi Jinping.

==History==
The term was coined in the early 20thÂ century in the Republic of China, referring to the son of Yuan Shikai (a self-declared emperor) and his cronies. It was later used to describe the relatives of the top four nationalist families; Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s kin, Soong Mei-ling&#x27;s kin, Chen Lifu&#x27;s kin, and Kong Xiangxi&#x27;s kin. After the 1950s, the term was used in Taiwan to describe Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek, and his friends. The latest generation of &quot;crown princes&quot; are in mainland China. The first generation of princelings in the PRC were the children of the initial revolutionaries. These children were initially raised in environments where their quality of life far eclipsed that of the ordinary Chinese citizen, often close to other princelings and senior party officials to develop a network of influence. Many senior leaders often lobby directly or indirectly for their descendants and relatives to succeed them.

Xiang Lanxin, professor of international history and politics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, explains it thus: Historically, how to control local officials who possessed imperial lineage was always a problem. The Politburo is equivalent to the inner circle of the imperial household. Its members, if assigned a local administrative position, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions as no other party officials can match them in rank and prestige.
Some of these crown princes are able to hold senior positions at the vice-ministerial level or above while still in their thirties, for which other ordinary cadres would struggle for decades. For national party positions, princelings often were promoted earlier and into higher positions than their non princeling counterparts.

It is speculated that when Jiang Zemin was close to the end of his term for his age, he put many Princelings into important positions to appeal to senior leaders of the CCP and win their support for his continued influence. There is a trend towards Princelings taking over power step by step. Of these, Yu Zhengsheng, son of Huang Jing, former mayor of Tianjin, was already a member of the powerful politburo of the CCP; Wang Qishan, son-in-law of Yao Yilin (former vice premier and member of politburo), mayor of Beijing; Xi Jinping, Bo Xilai, Zhou Xiaochuan, son of Zhou Jiannan (former minister of the First Machinery Ministry and Jiang Zemin&#x27;s former boss), governor of the People&#x27;s Bank of China, have also occupied important positions since the 17th Party Congress. Princelings have been holding a steady 5-6% of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CC-CCP) since the 12th Party Congress.

In 2013 a &quot;sons and daughters&quot; program instituted by JPMorgan Chase to hire young princelings for positions in its Chinese operations came to light during a bribery investigation by the SEC. At times standards for hiring young princelings were more lenient than those imposed on other Chinese. At least twelve of the princelings were revealed to have used companies in the offshore tax haven of the British Virgin Islands to store wealth in an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The leader or Godfather of the Princelings was Ye Xuanning, the second son of Ye Jianying. Ye Xuanning was low-profile but influential in political, military and business circles. Many people who ran into troubles looked for Ye and Ye was known for being able to resolve their problems.

The political influence of princelings have declined under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who himself is considered one. The number of princelings in the CCP Central Committee peaked in the 18th Central Committee, where there were a total of 41 princelings. By the beginning of the 20th Central Committee, their numbers decreased to 10, with the number further declining to 9 with the expelling of Li Shangfu. Similarly, there were four out of the seven members of the 18th Politburo Standing Committee members were princelings; in the 20th Politburo Standing Committee, Xi is the only remaining princeling.

==Popular culture==

In late 2015 and early 2016 the term &quot;Zhao family&quot; from Lu Xun&#x27;s novella &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, went viral in China after it was used in an anonymous article &quot;Barbarians at the Gate, Zhao Family Inside&quot; to allude to princelings involvement in a business dispute.

<doc id="221325" wikidata="Q312593" url="?curid=221325" title="Frederick North, Lord North">
<text>Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford (13 April 17325 August 1792), better known by his courtesy title Lord North, which he used from 1752 to 1790, was Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1770 to 1782. He led Great Britain through most of the American Revolutionary War. He also held a number of other cabinet posts, including Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer.

North&#x27;s reputation among historians has varied wildly, reaching its lowest point in the late 19th century, when he was depicted as a creature of the king and an incompetent who lost the American colonies. In the early 20th century, a revised view emerged which emphasised his strengths in administering the Treasury, handling the House of Commons, and in defending the Church of England. Historian Herbert Butterfield, however, argued that his indolence was a barrier to efficient crisis management; he neglected his role in supervising the entire war effort.

==Early life==
=== Birth and family ===
North was born in London on 13 April 1732 at the family house at Albemarle Street, just off Piccadilly. He spent much of his youth at Wroxton Abbey in Oxfordshire. North&#x27;s strong resemblance to King George III suggested to contemporaries that George III&#x27;s father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, might have been North&#x27;s real father, making North the king&#x27;s half-brother, a theory compatible with the prince&#x27;s reputation but supported by little else other than the circumstantial evidence. 

King George IV remarked that &quot;either his royal grandfather or North&#x27;s mother must have played her husband false&quot;, North&#x27;s father, Francis North, 1st Earl of Guilford, was from 1730 to 1751 Lord of the Bedchamber to Frederick, Prince of Wales, who stood as godfather to the infant, christened Frederick, possibly in honour of his real father.

North was descended from Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, paternal uncle of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich and was related to Samuel Pepys and the 3rd Earl of Bute. He at times had a slightly turbulent relationship with his father Francis North, yet they were very close. In his early years, the family was not wealthy, though their situation improved in 1735 when his father inherited property from his cousin.

Frederick&#x27;s mother, Lady Lucy Montagu, a daughter of George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax and his first wife, Ricarda Posthuma Staltonstall, died in 1734. His father remarried, but his stepmother, Elizabeth Kaye, widow of George Legge, Viscount Lewisham, eldest son of William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth and his wife, Lady Anne Finch, third daughter of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford, died in 1745, when Frederick was thirteen. One of his stepbrothers was William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, who remained a close friend for life.

=== Education ===
He was educated at Eton College between 1742 and 1748 and at Trinity College, Oxford, where in 1750 he was awarded an MA. After leaving Oxford, he travelled in Europe on a Grand Tour with Lord Dartmouth. They stayed in Leipzig for nearly nine months, studying under the constitutional scholar Johann Jacob Mascov. They continued through Austria and Italy, staying in Rome from December 1752 to Easter 1753, then through Switzerland to Paris, returning to England in early 1754.
==Early political career==
=== Member of Parliament ===
On 15 April 1754, North, then 22, was elected unopposed as the member of parliament for the constituency of Banbury. He served as an MP from 1754 to 1790 and joined the government as a junior Lord of the Treasury on 2 June 1759 during the PittâNewcastle ministry (an alliance between the Duke of Newcastle and William Pitt the Elder). He soon developed a reputation as a good administrator and parliamentarian and was generally liked by his colleagues. Although he initially considered himself a Whig, he did not closely align with any of the Whig factions in Parliament, and it became obvious to many contemporaries that his sympathies were largely Tory.

He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the 1st Somerset Militia on 23 June 1759 when it was embodied for fulltime service, and commanded it in the West Country for Earl Poulett, the colonel, who was also Lord Lieutenant of Somerset. However, North resigned in November 1761 and concentrated on his political career.

In November 1763, he was chosen to speak for the government concerning radical MP John Wilkes. Wilkes had made a savage attack on both the Prime Minister and the king in his newspaper &quot;The North Briton&quot;, which many thought libellous. North&#x27;s motion that Wilkes be expelled from the House of Commons passed by 273 votes to 111. Wilkes&#x27; expulsion took place in his absence, as he had already fled to France following a duel.

=== In government ===
When a government headed by the Whig magnate Charles Watson-Wentworth, Lord Rockingham came to power in 1765, North left his post and served for a time as a backbench MP. He turned down an offer by Rockingham to rejoin the government, not wanting to be associated with the Whig grandees that dominated the Ministry.

He returned to office when Pitt returned to head a second government in 1766. North was appointed Joint Paymaster of the Forces in Pitt&#x27;s ministry and became a Privy Counsellor. As Pitt was constantly ill, the government was effectively run by Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, with North as one of its most senior members.

In December 1767, he succeeded Charles Townshend as Chancellor of the Exchequer. With the resignation of the secretary of state Henry Seymour Conway in early 1768, North became Leader of the Commons as well. He continued to serve when Pitt was succeeded by Grafton in October.

==Prime Minister==

===Appointment===
When the Duke of Grafton resigned as Prime Minister, North formed a government on 28 January 1770. His ministers and supporters tended to be known as Tories, though they were not a formal grouping and many had previously been Whigs. He took over with Great Britain in a triumphant state following the Seven Years&#x27; War, which had seen the First British Empire expand to a peak by taking in vast new territories on several continents. Circumstances forced him to keep many members of the previous cabinet in their jobs, despite their lack of agreement with him. In contrast to many of his predecessors, North enjoyed a good relationship with George III, partly based on their shared patriotism and desire for decency in their private lives.

===Falklands Crisis===

North&#x27;s ministry had an early success during the Falklands Crisis in 1770, in which Great Britain faced down a Spanish attempt to seize the Falkland Islands, nearly provoking a war. Both France and Spain had been left unhappy by Great Britain&#x27;s perceived dominance following the British victory in the Seven Years War. Spanish forces seized the British settlement on the Falklands and expelled the small British garrison. When Britain opposed the seizure, Spain sought backing from her ally France. King Louis XV of France did not believe his country was ready for war, however, and in the face of a strong mobilisation of the British fleet, the French compelled the Spanish to back down. Louis also dismissed the Duc de Choiseul, the hawkish Chief Minister of France, who had advocated war and a large invasion of Great Britain by the French.

The British government&#x27;s prestige and popularity were enormously boosted by the incident. It had successfully managed to drive a wedge between France and Spain and demonstrated the power of the Royal Navy, although it was suggested by critics that this gave Lord North a degree of complacency and an incorrect belief that the European powers would not interfere in British colonial affairs. This was contrasted with the previous administration&#x27;s failure to prevent France from annexing the Republic of Corsica, a British ally, during the Corsican Crisis two years earlier. Using his newly found popularity, North took a chance and appointed Lord Sandwich to the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty.

===American War of Independence===

Most of North&#x27;s government was focused first on the growing problems with the American colonies. Later on, it was preoccupied with conducting the American War of Independence that broke out in 1775 with the Battle of Lexington. Following the Boston Tea Party in 1773, Lord North proposed a number of legislative measures that were supposed to punish the Bostonians. These measures were known as the Coercive Acts in Great Britain, while dubbed the Intolerable Acts in the colonies. By shutting down the Boston government and cutting off trade, he hoped they would keep the peace and dispirit the rebellious colonists. Instead, the acts further inflamed Massachusetts and the other colonies, eventually resulting in open war during the Boston campaign of 1775â76.

North delegated the overall strategy of the war to his key subordinates Lord George Germain and the Earl of Sandwich. Despite a series of victories and the capture of New York and Philadelphia, the British were unable to secure a decisive victory. In 1778, the French allied themselves with the American rebels, and Spain joined the war in 1779 as an ally of France, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1780. The British found themselves fighting a global war on four continents without a single ally. After 1778, the British switched the focus of their efforts to the defence of the West Indies, as their sugar wealth made them much more valuable to Great Britain than the Thirteen Colonies. In 1779, Great Britain was faced with the prospect of a major Franco-Spanish invasion, but the Armada of 1779 was ultimately a failure. Several peace initiatives fell through, and an attempt by Richard Cumberland to negotiate a separate peace with Spain ended in frustration.

The country&#x27;s problems were augmented by the First League of Armed Neutrality, which was formed to counter the British blockade strategy, and threatened British naval supplies from the Baltic. With severe manpower shortages, North&#x27;s government passed an act abandoning previous statutes placing restrictions on Catholics serving in the military. This provoked an upsurge of anti-Catholic feelings and the formation of the Protestant Association that led to the Gordon Riots in London in June 1780. For around a week, the city was in the control of the mob until the military was called out and martial law imposed. Public opinion, especially in middle-class and elite circles, repudiated anti-Catholicism and violence, and rallied behind the North government. Demands were made for a London police force.

Britain&#x27;s fortunes in the war in America had temporarily improved following the failure of a Franco-American attack on Newport and the prosecution of a Southern strategy that saw the capture of Charleston, South Carolina and its garrison. During 1780 and 1781, the North government gained strength in the House of Commons.

In October 1781, British forces under Lord Cornwallis surrendered at the conclusion of the Siege of Yorktown, dealing a crushing blow to British morale. When the news reached North, he took it &quot;as he would have taken a ball in his breast&quot;, and exclaimed repeatedly &quot;Oh God! It is all over!&quot;

===Resignation===

North was the second British Prime Minister to be forced out of office by a motion of no confidence; the first was Sir Robert Walpole in 1742. Lord North resigned on 20 March 1782 on account of the British defeat at Yorktown the year before. In an attempt to end the war, he proposed the Conciliation Plan, in which he promised that Great Britain would eliminate all disagreeable acts if the colonies ended the war. The colonies rejected the plan, as their goal had become full independence.

In April 1782, it was suggested in cabinet by Lord Shelburne that North should be brought to public trial for his conduct of the American War, but the prospect was soon abandoned. Ironically, the war began to turn in Great Britain&#x27;s favour again in 1782 through naval victories, owing largely to policies adopted by Lord North and the Earl of Sandwich. The British naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes took place after the government&#x27;s fall. Despite predictions that Gibraltar&#x27;s fall was imminent, that fortress managed to hold out and was relieved. Great Britain was able to make a much more favourable peace in 1783 than had appeared likely at the time when North had been ousted. In spite of this, North was critical of the terms agreed by the Shelburne government which he felt undervalued the strength of the British negotiating position.

== Post-premiership ==
===FoxâNorth coalition ===

In April 1783, North returned to power as Home Secretary in an unlikely coalition with the radical Whig leader Charles James Fox known as the FoxâNorth Coalition under the nominal leadership of the Duke of Portland. King George III, who detested the radical and republican Fox, never forgave this supposed betrayal, and North never again served in government after the ministry fell in December 1783. One of the major achievements of the coalition was the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the American War of Independence.

The new Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, was not expected to last long, and North, a vocal critic, still entertained hopes of regaining high office. In this, he was to be frustrated, as Pitt dominated the British political scene for the next twenty years, leaving both North and Fox in the political wilderness.

===Later years===
North was an active speaker until he began to go blind in 1786. He succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Guilford on 4 August 1790 and entered the House of Lords, by which time he had entirely lost his sight. Lord Guilford died in Mayfair, England (now part of London), and was buried at All Saints&#x27; Church, Wroxton (Oxfordshire), near his family home of Wroxton Abbey. His memorial was sculpted by John Flaxman RA.

His son George North, Lord North, took over the constituency of Banbury, and in 1792 acceded to his father&#x27;s title. Wroxton Abbey is now owned by Fairleigh Dickinson University, ironically an American college, and the modernised abbey serves as a location for American students to study abroad in England.

==Legacy==
Lord North is today predominantly remembered as the Prime Minister &quot;who lost America&quot;.

Both Lord North Street and Guilford Street in London are named after him.

==Family==

On 20 May 1756 Lord North married Anne Speke (before 17411797), daughter of George Speke MP, of Whitelackington in Somerset. She was the sole heiress of the Devonshire estates of the Drake family of Ash, which subsequently were sold piecemeal by Lord North. By Anne he had seven children:
* George Augustus North, 3rd Earl of Guilford (11 September 175720 April 1802), who married, firstly, Maria Frances Mary Hobart-Hampden (died 23 April 1794), daughter of the 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire, on 30 September 1785 and had issue. He married, secondly, Susan Coutts (died 24 September 1837), on 28 February 1796.
* Catherine Anne North (1760â1817), who married Sylvester Douglas, 1st Baron Glenbervie, and had no children.
* Francis North, 4th Earl of Guilford (25 December 1761â1817)
* Lady Anne North (8 January 176418 January 1832), who married the 1st Earl of Sheffield on 20 January 1798 and had two children
* Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford (7 February 1766â1827)
* Lady Charlotte North (December 1770â25 October 1849), who married Lt. Col. The Hon. John Lindsay (15 March 17626 March 1826), son of the 5th Earl of Balcarres, on 2 April 1800.
*Dudley North (31 May 1777 â 1779). His name is missing from some lists of Lord and Lady North&#x27;s children, which incorrectly state they only had six.

<text>Frederick George Hobson, known as Fred Leslie (1 April 1855 â 7 December 1892), was an English actor, singer, comedian and dramatist.

Beginning his career in operetta, Leslie became best known for starring in, and writing (under the pseudonym A. C. Torr, a pun on the word &quot;actor&quot;), popular burlesque plays and other comic works of theatre.

==Biography==
Leslie was born in Woolwich, London. He was the youngest son of Charles Hobson, a wealthy military outfitter, and Sarah Hobson, &quot;nÃ©e&quot; Pye. Leslie was educated in Woolwich, Lewisham and Pas-de-Calais. As a young man, he performed in amateur plays while working in commerce. He married Louisa (Louie) Agate in 1879. The couple had three children. The oldest of them, William Herbert Leslie Hobson (1880â1945), became a stage and film actor and singer also using the name &quot;Fred Leslie&quot;.

===Career===
After briefly touring the British provinces, he made his first stage appearance in London at the Royalty Theatre as old Colonel Hardy in &quot;Paul Pry&quot; in 1878. He was soon engaged by Kate Santley at the Royalty, where he played the title role in &quot;Mr Lewis&quot;. At the same theatre in 1879, he played the part of Po-Hi opposite Santley in &quot;Tita in Thibet&quot;, a two-act comedy musical by Frank Desprez. He next played Agamemnon (under the name of &quot;Mr Leslie&quot;) in &quot;La belle HÃ©lÃ¨ne&quot; by &quot;Jacques Offenbach&quot;. His vocal quality suited him to play the comic baritone roles in French operettas. He soon appeared in operettas such as &quot;Madame Favart&quot;, &quot;La fille du tambour-major&quot; (1880) and &quot;Olivette&quot;; and he played Faust in &quot;Mefistofele&quot; (1880) with Constance Loseby as Marguerite and Lionel Brough as Valentine. In addition, he played some leading roles in musical theatre pieces under the management of Selina Dolaro at the Folly Theatre and at the Alhambra Theatre in &quot;The Bronze Horse&quot; (1891) &quot;La petite mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Les manteaux noirs&quot;, among others.
In 1882, Leslie found wide success as the title character in the operetta &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, by Robert Planquette, at the Comedy Theatre, also starring W. S. Penley. In 1882 and 1883 he played in America at the Casino Theatre and elsewhere with the McCaull Comic Opera Company in &quot;The Merry War&quot; and &quot;The Beggar Student&quot;. In 1884 he played in &quot;Fay o&#x27; Fire&quot;, which featured Marie Tempest in one of her first roles. The same year, at the Comedy Theatre, he played in H. B. Farnie and Edmond Audran&#x27;s adaptation, &quot;The Great Mogul&quot; with Florence St. John, Frank Wyatt and Arthur Roberts.

In 1885 Leslie joined the Gaiety Theatre, London company as Jonathan Wild in H. P. Stephens and W. Yardley&#x27;s burlesque &quot;Little Jack Sheppard&quot;, with music by Meyer Lutz, and also starring Nellie Farren as Jack. The piece was a hit, and for the next seven years he and Farren were the pillars of the popular Gaiety Theatre burlesques. In 1887, his &quot;Miss Esmeralda&quot; was successful; &quot;Frankenstein, or The Vampire&#x27;s Victim&quot;, in which he played a monster in touch with his feminine side, was a flop. In 1888â89, Leslie, with Farren&#x27;s Gaiety company, toured in the US and Australia, in &quot;Monte Cristo Jr.&quot; and &quot;Miss Esmeralda&quot; (together with Sylvia Grey, Marion Hood and Letty Lind). At the same time, Leslie played roles in other pieces, for example &quot;David Garrick&quot; by Thomas W. Robertson at the Gaiety in 1886.
Leslie&#x27;s Don Caesar de Bazan in &quot;Ruy Blas and the BlasÃ© RouÃ©&quot; (1888, a take off of Victor Hugo&#x27;s play &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;), was perhaps the most popular of his later parts, and he and Farren starred at the Gaiety and toured in this production and in &quot;Miss Esmeralda&quot;, and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1891). In 1891, Leslie and Farren again toured Australia with the Gaiety company in &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; and &quot;Cinder Ellen up too Late&quot; (with Sidney Jones as conductor). Leslie died while rehearsing for his last burlesque, &quot;Don Juan&quot; (with lyrics by Adrian Ross). His early death, coupled with Farren&#x27;s illness and retirement in 1892, brought to an end the type of Gaiety burlesque associated with them, at the same time that Edwardian musical comedy came to dominate the London theatre.

Leslie was known for his versatility, agility, entertaining personality and talent as a mimic. His performances, including singing (he was a baritone), dancing, clowning and whistling, were noted for their &quot;high spirits and ludicrous charm&quot;. Under the pseudonym of &quot;A. C. Torr&quot;, he was part-author of many of his burlesques and also wrote the burlesque &quot;Guy Fawkes Jr&quot; for Arthur Roberts in 1890. Although Leslie is remembered best for the burlesques, he was a fine comic actor whom the critic Clement Scott called &quot;one of the great lyric and comic artists of my time.&quot;

===Early death===
Leslie died of typhoid fever at his home in London at the age of 37. He was buried in Charlton Cemetery in Greenwich, England.

<text>Jean Robert Planquette (; 31 July 1848 â 28 January 1903) was a French composer of songs and operettas.

Several of Planquette&#x27;s operettas were extraordinarily successful in Britain, especially &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot; (1878), the length of whose initial London run broke all records for any piece of musical theatre up to that time. &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1882) also earned international fame.

==Life and career==
The son of a singer, Planquette was born in Paris and educated at the Paris Conservatoire. He did not finish his studies, lacking the funds to do so, and worked as a cafÃ© pianist and composer and singing (he was a tenor). A few romances that he composed brought less fame than did his song, &quot;Sambre et Meuse&quot;, first sung in 1867 by Lucien FugÃ¨re, who went on to be one of the foremost French opera singers of his day.

In 1876, the director of the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Folies-Dramatiques gave Planquette a commission to compose his first operetta, &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot;. It opened in Paris in 1877, running for an extremely successful 480 performances, and then enjoyed an astonishing London run, beginning in 1878, of a record-breaking 708 performances. Planquette&#x27;s music has been praised for its pathos and romantic feeling. &quot;Le Chevalier Gaston&quot; was produced in 1879 with little success. In 1880 came &quot;Les Voltigeurs du 32ieme&quot; which had a long run in London in 1887 as &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, and &quot;La CantiniÃ©re&quot;, which was translated into English as &quot;Nectarine&quot;, though never produced.

In 1882 &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; was produced in London and subsequently given in Paris as &quot;Rip&quot;, in both cases with great success. The libretto is an adaptation by H. B. Farnie of Washington Irving&#x27;s famous tale. In 1884 the phenomenon of an opera by a French composer being produced in London before being heard in Paris was repeated in &quot;Nell Gwynne&quot;, which was modestly successful, but failed when produced in Paris as &quot;La Princesse Colombine&quot;. It was followed by &quot;La CrÃ©maillere&quot; (Paris, 1885), &quot;Surcouf&quot; (Paris, 1887; London, as &quot;Paul Jones&quot;, 1889), &quot;Captain ThÃ©rÃ©se&quot; (London, 1887), &quot;La Cocarde tricolore&quot; (Paris, 1892), &quot;Le Talisman&quot; (Paris, 1892), &quot;Panurge&quot; (Paris, 1895) and &quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Quat&#x27;sous&quot; (Paris, 1897).

Another Planquette composition, the march &quot;Le RÃ©giment de Sambre et Meuse,&quot; has achieved fame in an arrangement for brass band; it is the tune used by the Ohio State University Marching Band when performing their famed Script Ohio formation. The original orchestral version has been recorded by the Boston Pops Orchestra conducted by Arthur Fiedler and appears on the RCA Living Stereo CD &quot;Marches in Hi-Fi&quot;. &quot;The Song of the Cabin Boy,&quot; a barcarolle from Planquette&#x27;s &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot; was played on the violin by W.K.L. Dickson in the first experiment in history in synchronizing sound and motion pictures (1894). It is viewable online as &quot;The Dickson Experimental Sound Film&quot;.

<text>Charles John Kean (18 January 181122 January 1868) was an Irish-born English actor and theatre manager, best known for his revivals of Shakespearean plays.

==Life==
Kean was born at Waterford, Ireland, a son of actor Edmund Kean and actress Mary Kean (&quot;nee&quot; Chambers). After preparatory education at Worplesdon and at Greenford, near Harrow, he was sent to Eton College, where he remained three years. In 1827, he was offered a cadetship in the East India Company&#x27;s service, which he was prepared to accept if his father would settle an income of Â£400 on his mother. The elder Kean refused to do this, and his son determined to become an actor. He made his first appearance at Drury Lane on 1 October 1827 as Norval in Home&#x27;s &quot;Douglas&quot;, but his continued failure to achieve popularity led him to leave London in the spring of 1828 for the provinces. In Glasgow, on 1 October in that year, father and son acted together in Arnold Payne&#x27;s &quot;Brutus&quot;, the elder Kean in the title-part and his son as Titus.
After a visit to the United States in 1830, where he was received with much favour, he appeared in 1833 at Covent Garden as &quot;Sir Edmund Mortimer&quot; in Colman&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Chest&quot;, but his success was not pronounced enough to encourage him to remain in London, especially as he had already won a high position in the provinces. In January 1838, however, he returned to Drury Lane, and played Hamlet with a success which gave him a place among the principal tragedians of his time. He married the actress Ellen Tree (1805â1880) on 25 January 1842, they performed on the Lincoln Circuit in April and May 1845 appearing at Stamford, Peterborough, Boston, Lincoln (where the theatre was uncommonly well attended) and the Georgian Angles Theatre, Wisbech before making a second visit to America with her from 1845 to 1847.

Returning to England, he entered on a successful engagement at the Haymarket Theatre, and in 1850, with Robert Keeley, became lessee of the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London. The most noteworthy feature of his management was a series of gorgeous Shakespearean revivals that aimed for &quot;authenticity&quot;. Kean also mentored the young Ellen Terry in juvenile roles. In melodramatic parts such as the king in Dion Boucicault&#x27;s adaptation of Casimir Delavigne&#x27;s &quot;Louis XI&quot;, and Louis and Fabian dei Franchi in Boucicault&#x27;s adaptation of Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot;, his success was complete. In 1854 the writer Charles Reade created a play &quot;The Courier of Lyons&quot; for Kean to appear in, which became one of the most popular plays of the Victorian era.

From his &quot;tour round the world&quot; Kean returned in 1866 in broken health, and died in London on 22 January 1868 at the age of 57. He is buried at Horndean, Hampshire.

==Family==

His daughter Mary Maria Kean, married the eminent military surgeon, Surgeon general Cosmo Gordon Logie.

<doc id="221350" wikidata="Q2916410" url="?curid=221350" title="Narcoterrorism">
<text>Narcoterrorism, in its original context, is understood to refer to the attempts of narcotics traffickers to influence the policies of a government or a society through violence and intimidation, and to hinder the enforcement of anti-drug laws by the systematic threat or use of such violence. As with most definitions of terrorism, it typically only refers to non-state actors.

== Description ==
Pablo Escobar&#x27;s violence in his dealings with the Colombian government is probably one of the most known and best documented examples of narcoterrorism. The term itself was coined by former President Fernando BelaÃºnde Terry of Peru in 1983 when describing terrorist attacks against his nation&#x27;s anti-narcotics police. The term has become a subject of controversy, largely due to its use in discussing violent opposition to the US government&#x27;s War on Drugs.

The term is being increasingly used for terrorist organizations that engage in drug trafficking activity to fund their operations and gain recruits and expertise. Such organizations include FARC, ELN, AUC in Colombia, PCP-SL in Peru, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban.

A 2013 Congressional Research Service report noted that in 2003, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reported that 14 of 36 (39%) of the groups designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations &quot;were involved &#x27;to some degree&#x27; in illicit narcotics activity&quot; while in fiscal year 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) &quot;reported that 29 of the top 63 international drug syndicates, identified as such on the consolidated priority organization target (CPOT) list, were associated with terrorists.&quot;

In 2025the U.S. began funding, continued under the U.S. Bush administration, of Plan Colombia, intending to eradicate drug crops and to act against drug lords accused of engaging in narcoterrorism, including among them the leaders of the Marxist FARC and the AUC paramilitary forces. The U.S. government is funding large-scale drug eradication campaigns and supporting Colombian military operations, seeking the extradition of commanders.

Although al-Qaeda is often said to finance its activities through drug trafficking, the 9/11 Commission Report notes that &quot;while the drug trade was a source of income for the Taliban, it did not serve the same purpose for al Qaeda, and there is no reliable evidence that bin Laden was involved in or made his money through drug trafficking.&quot; The organization gains most of its finances through donations, particularly those by &quot;wealthy Saudi individuals&quot;.

Critics of the prohibition of drugs say that prohibition itself funds terrorism, due to it indirectly making the black market and criminal organizations responsible for all sale.

==Examples==

Areas or countries that have experienced narcoterrorist activity or narco-warfare include:
* Syria, wherein the ruling al-Assad family had sponsored various militant groups that control territories in Lebanon and Syria to finance the world&#x27;s largest multi-billion dollar drug industry. The Assad regime supported the drug trafficking operations of militant group Hezbollah, which was vital for the group&#x27;s finances.
* Afghanistan, to fund operations with sales of opium and heroin in the Afghanistan War
* Brazil, which has several organized and trained groups that dominate territories, carry out offensives against state and federal security forces, control the clandestine market for drugs, weapons and ammunition and apply violence through psychological, communal and indiscriminate terrorism against the civilian population.
* Colombia, which has influential right-wing paramilitary &quot;narco-terrorists&quot;, Clan del Golfo, Los Rastrojos, The Black Eagles and left-wing revolutionary guerrillas such as the Popular Liberation Army.
* India&#x27;s D-Company, a Philippine-based crime syndicate which carried out the 1993 Bombay bombings. Said to be involved in large-scale drug trafficking via their contacts in Pakistani intelligence.
* Kosovo, during the war in 1999. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) used &quot;narcoterrorism&quot; to finance its operations.
* Lebanon â Hezbollah is said to derive its income from drug trafficking operations in both the Middle East and Latin America. According to research conducted by the Abba Eban Institute as part of an initiative called the Janus Initiative, Hezbollah makes a profit in the cocaine smuggling market to leverage it for terrorist activities. Hezbollah operatives are overseeing illicit finance and drug trafficking activities, moving about $200 million a month.
* Mexico has drug cartels and gangs such as Sinaloa Cartel - Gente Nueva, Los Zetas, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, La LÃ­nea (gang), La Resistencia (gang), Los Mexicles, Los Pelones, Artistas Asesinos, and Barrio Azteca.
* United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), where loyalist paramilitaries like the Ulster Volunteer Force are believed to be involved in drug dealing.
* Peru has left-wing revolutionary guerrillas such as the Shining Path.

== Narcoterrorism in Colombia ==

During the period from 1984â1993, Colombia was known as one of the countries to have suffered a number of terrorist attacks at the hands of narcotic traffickers. Belisario Betancourt, Virgilio Barco and CÃ©sar Gaviria were three Colombian presidents that constantly battled against the MedellÃ­n Cartelâs unrelenting war on the government, especially through its branch known as Los Extraditables led by Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Gustavo Gaviria and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. A number of crimes by âLos Extraditablesâ were due to their constant battles against the governmentâs policies on extradition and their collaborations with the United States government who sought to bring the Colombian drug bosses to justice. These terrorist acts typically consisted of assassinations of political figures, kidnappings, and bombings. The wing of the cartel also known as Los Priscos reportedly also participated directly in these acts of terrorism at the behest of the MedellÃ­n Cartelâs top leaders.

=== History ===

Pablo Escobar was elected as a representative as an alternative congress delegate, but allegations from politicians, the newspaper âEl Espectadorâ and the minister of justice declared him a drug trafficker and he was eventually dismissed from Congress on January 4, 1984.

On April 30, 1984, a motorcycle gunman from the Medellin Cartel killed the minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. On November 6, 1985 the 19th of April Movement (Marxist guerrillas) sieged the palace of Justice in order to hold all supreme magistrates hostage. The organized military reaction caused the building to burn resulting in the deaths of 91 people, 11 of which were judges. Although the M-19 denies being funded from outside sources, multiple sources say the Medellin Cartel funded them. Additionally, numerous bombs detonated across the country, the most memorable bomb being the one that brought down Avianca Flight 203 during its flight over Soacha Cundinamarca resulting in 107 dead in 1989.

In Colombian history, the FARC were initially major enemies of the drug cartels. The MAS (Muerte a los secuestradores - Death to the kidnappers) was a group created by the most eminent members of the Cali cartel, including Escobar and Ochoa against the guerrillas who had kidnapped one of Ochoa&#x27;s sister. The MAS was responsible for the deaths of 500 members of the Patriotic Union, a political party that emerged from the demobilization of part of the FARC in the 1990s. Significantly, it is worth recalling that Medellin cartel refused to buy coca from peasants living in areas under FARC control. From then on, even when there was evidence of collaboration between FARC and the drug traffickers, these connections were described as Â« temporary alliances Â».

President Alvaro Uribe, who was elected on the idea of waging an all-out war against the FARC, over-emphasized the link between drugs and the FARC as well as the terrorist nature of the guerilla group in a post 2001 context: â(Ãlvaro Uribe) increasingly equated the guerrillas with drug traffickers and terroristsâ . This policy has provoked much criticism which has enriched the debate on the nature of the conflict in Colombia, and consequently on the character of the FARC.

<doc id="221351" wikidata="Q236769" url="?curid=221351" title="Krabi province">
<text>Krabi ( ) is a province (&quot;changwat&quot;) of southern Thailand, on the shore of the Andaman Sea. Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Phang Nga, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Trang. Phuket province lies to the west across Phang Nga Bay. Krabi town is the seat of the provincial government.

==Geography==

The region of Krabi is characterized by distinctive limestone formations known as mogotes, which are scattered both inland and along the coast. These geological features attract rock climbers globally, particularly to Ton Sai Beach and Railay Beach on the Phra Nang Peninsula. Among Krabi&#x27;s 154 islands, Ko Phi Phi Le stands out for its recognition as a filming location for the movie &quot;The Beach&quot;. Other significant islands include Ko Phi Phi Don, a part of the Phi Phi Islands, and Ko Lanta, a larger island situated to the south. The coastal area of Krabi suffered extensive damage during the tsunami on 26 December 2004.

Krabi&#x27;s mogotes are home to numerous caves, many of which feature speleothems such as stalactites and stalagmites. Notably, the caves of Tham Chao Le and Tham Phi Hua To in the Ao Luek District house prehistoric rock paintings that depict humans, animals, and geometric shapes. In 1986, the Lang Rong Rien cave yielded 40,000-year-old human artifacts, including stone tools, pottery, and bones, marking one of the earliest known human settlements in Southeast Asia. Additionally, these caves are a primary source for the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet, which are used in the preparation of bird&#x27;s nest soup.

Agriculture in Krabi is predominantly focused on rubber and palm oil production. Palm oil plantations alone cover approximately , accounting for 52 percent of the province&#x27;s agricultural land. Combined, palm oil and rubber plantations constitute 95 percent of Krabi&#x27;s cultivated land, with a mix of smallholder farms and larger industrial plantations. The total forested area in Krabi is around , representing 17.2 percent of the province&#x27;s total area.

==History==
Nakhon Si Thammarat. Historically, Krabi remained under the administrative jurisdiction of Nakhon Si Thammarat, a practice that continued even after 1872, when King Chulalongkorn elevated Krabi to town status. In 1875, Krabi underwent a significant administrative change, transitioning to a direct subordinate of Bangkok, marking its evolution into a province. The administrative seat of the province was initially located at Ban Talad Kao. However, in 1900, the governor relocated it to its current position at the mouth of the Krabi River, establishing the modern provincial structure.

==Symbols==
The seal of the province shows two ancient crossed swords (&quot;krabi&quot; is a word for an ancient Siamese sword) in front of the Indian Ocean and Khao Phanom Bencha mountain which, at above sea level, is the highest mountain of the province.

The provincial slogan is, &quot;Krabi, the liveable city, friendly people.&quot;

The provincial tree is the &quot;blue sky&quot; (Thai: thung-fa à¸à¸¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸²) or &quot;Alstonia macrophylla&quot;. The provincial aquatic life the edible sea snail (Thai: hoi-chak-teen à¸«à¸­à¸¢à¸à¸±à¸à¸à¸µà¸) or &quot;Laevistrombus canarium&quot; because it is the local delicacy.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
Krabi is subdivided into eight districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;), which are further divided into 53 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 374 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Krabi Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 13 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Krabi has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 12 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 48 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

== Population and culture ==

Krabi Province is home to a diverse population comprising Buddhists, Thai-Chinese, Moken (commonly referred to as sea gypsies), and Muslims. The population density varies significantly across the region. The coastal areas, particularly in Nuea Khlong District and Krabi City Districts, are the most densely populated, with densities exceeding 150 people per square kilometer. In contrast, the least densely populated area is the inland mountainous region of Khao Phanom District, where the density is approximately 61 persons per square kilometer.

In terms of religious practices, Buddhism is the predominant faith, observed by around 65 percent of the population. Islam follows closely, with approximately 34 percent adherence among residents. Historically, the inhabitants of Krabi have been engaged in agriculture, leveraging the province&#x27;s richness in natural resources such as rubber, palm oil, and oranges. In recent years, however, tourism has emerged as a significant source of income for the region.
==Economy==
In Krabi Province, the economy is predominantly supported by agriculture, tourism, and, to a lesser extent, fisheries. Rubber cultivation stands as the leading cash crop in the region, followed closely by palm oil production. Univanich Palm Oil PCL, Thailand&#x27;s largest palm oil producer, is headquartered in Krabi. This corporation directly employs approximately 1,000 individuals and additionally engages with around 2,000 local small and medium-sized growers for feedstock procurement.

===Tourism===

Krabi ranks fifth in Thailand in terms of tourism revenue, following Bangkok, Phuket, Chonburi, and Chiang Mai. The province witnesses around six million tourists annually, with the peak season spanning from November to April. However, the influx of tourists during the high season has raised environmental concerns. To address this, local authorities have implemented the &quot;Krabi 365 Days&quot; initiative, aiming to redistribute tourist visits throughout the year, including during the off-season or &quot;green season&quot; (May to October), a period characterized by seasonal rainfall. Tourism revenue in Krabi has been experiencing an average annual growth of eight percent. In 2018, the revenue from tourism was projected to reach 100 billion baht, an increase from the 96 billion baht recorded in 2017. The majority of visitors to Krabi are from China and Malaysia, with Scandinavian tourists also featuring prominently among international arrivals. According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), , the province hosts approximately 460 hotels, with an additional 200 hotels undergoing licensing procedures and another 200 in preliminary planning stages.

==Transport==
Since 1999 the province has been served by the international Krabi International Airport.

Phetkasem Road (Highway 4) passes through the province.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


==Environment==

In mid-2015, the Thai government&#x27;s proposal to construct an 800-megawatt coal-fired electricity generating station in Tambon Pakasai, Amphoe Nuea Khlong, drew significant public opposition. Critics of the project, including those engaging in protests and hunger strikes, expressed concerns about the potential environmental impact on Krabi&#x27;s relatively unspoiled ecosystem. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) proceeded with the development plans, intending to initiate the bidding process without a comprehensive environmental assessment, citing time-saving measures. This plant in Krabi is part of a broader strategy to build nine coal-fired power plants across southern Thailand over the next two decades. This initiative aims to compensate for the declining natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand. However, the opposition, advocating for a three-year delay to explore the feasibility of achieving 100 percent renewable energy in the province, claims their concerns have been disregarded.

The decision to advance with the Krabi coal-fired power station, a significant project valued at 48 billion baht and designed to generate 315 MWe, poses environmental challenges. Coal is a known source of mercury contamination, as evidenced in Tha Thum in Prachinburi province, where mercury levels up to 12 times higher than acceptable limits have been detected. Potential sources of contamination include fly ash from coal power plants, coal dust from storage areas, or the use of coal ash as fertilizer. These factors raise concerns about similar risks in Krabi. Current coal pollution mitigation technologies, often referred to as &quot;clean coal,&quot; are in the early stages of development and primarily address pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. The more complex and costly process of carbon dioxide sequestration remains a significant challenge. Two academics have critically addressed the general efficacy of coal pollution mitigation, stating that &quot;So-called &#x27;clean coal&#x27; is expensive, untested, unwieldy, and unworkable, yet it is often presented as a comprehensive solution.
In mid-2016, a pro-renewables working group in Krabi released a &quot;Green Power Development Plan,&quot; proposing that Krabi province could meet its electricity requirements entirely through renewable energy sources, primarily biomass and biogas. The plan projected that in an initial three-year phase, biomass could contribute 118 MW, solar power 55 MW, biogas 54 MW, and wind energy 40 MW to the energy mix. In the following three years, the plan anticipated renewable energy sources could generate 287 MW, surpassing the province&#x27;s peak electricity demand of 143 MW recorded in 2015. The adoption of this plan was projected to eliminate the need for coal imports, potentially saving 175 billion baht over a 25-year period.

In August 2016, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) initiated the bidding process for the construction of the proposed coal-fired power plant, receiving bids ranging from 32 to 34.9 billion baht. The bidding process coincided with the completion of the environmental and health impact assessments. Energy Minister Gen Anantaporn Kanjanarat stated in 2016 that a decision on whether to proceed with or abandon the plant would be made in November of that year.

Opposition to the EGAT power plant in Krabi has been significant, with a coalition formed by local administration officials, academics, businesspersons, and concerned citizens. This coalition has emerged as a strong adversary to EGAT&#x27;s plans for fossil fuel-based energy generation. Krabi, being a prominent tourist destination on the Andaman Coast, has local authorities who view coal negatively, describing it as &quot;filthy&quot; and inconsistent with the area&#x27;s tourism industry. The province has set an ambitious goal to become solely reliant on renewable energy sources.

===Projected impact of changes in climate===
A 2008 study examining the potential impact of climate change on Krabi province through the year 2033 yielded several projections:

* Temperature: The study predicts a modest increase in temperatures, with inland areas experiencing a rise of slightly more than 1ËC over the next 10 to 25 years. Coastal temperatures are anticipated to increase by slightly less than 1ËC in the same period.
* Rainfall: The duration of annual monsoons is projected to shorten, with a two-week reduction by 2018 and a four-week reduction by 2033. Overall, the total annual rainfall in Krabi may decrease by approximately 10 percent by the year 2033.
* Sea Level: A significant rise in sea level is anticipated, which could adversely affect Krabi&#x27;s mangrove wetlands. The study estimates an annual increase in mean sea level along the Krabi coastline of about 1Â cm over the next 25 years. A cumulative rise of 20Â cm over this period is projected to result in the retreat of existing shorelines (as of 2008) by 10 to 35 meters.

<text>Christian Lous Lange (17 September 1869 â 11 December 1938) was a Norwegian historian, teacher, and political scientist. He was one of the world&#x27;s foremost exponents of the theory and practice of internationalism.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Stavanger; his father was a military engineer and he was the grandson of the historian Christian C. A. Lange. He graduated from secondary school in 1887 and proceeded to travel and study history, English, and French at the University of Oslo, from which he received the cand. philol. degree in 1893. He taught at secondary schools for many years and eventually returned to the University of Oslo to receive a doctorate.

== Career ==
In 1899, he had his first official role in the internationalist movement when he was appointed secretary of the committee organizing an Oslo conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an organization dedicated to fostering discussion between parliamentarians of different countries. The next year, he was made secretary of the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament and, although he gave up the position in 1909, he would play a key role in the early days of the Norwegian Nobel Institute. During this time he was the Norwegian technical delegate to the Second Hague Peace Conference.

Lange rejoined the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1909 when he was appointed secretary general of the organization, a position he would retain until 1933. As secretary general he oversaw the Union&#x27;s move to Brussels, sustained it in Oslo through the challenging times of World War I, then moved it again to Geneva after the war. He remained active in numerous other organizations as well, acting as Norway&#x27;s delegate or alternate delegate to the League of Nations from its founding until 1938, writing reports and acting as a correspondent for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and participating in the Dutch sponsored Central Organisation for Durable Peace, among other activities. He was often called upon for his expertise in arbitration and arms control, in particular.

His intellectual support of internationalism was demonstrated by the first of a three volume historical treatise (&quot;Histoire de l&#x27;internationalisme&quot;). The work, published in 1919, was said to contribute to the ideological preparation for the League of Nations. For this and all his other activities, Lange shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Hjalmar Branting in 1921.

== Personal life and death ==
Lange died at the age of 69, one day after the 17th anniversary of his receipt of the Nobel Prize. He was the father of Carl Viggo Manthey Lange, Halvard Lange and Christian August Manthey Lange.

His daughter Thora was a history and language teacher, from 1938 at Oslo Cathedral School. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany she joined the resistance movement while her husband went in exile. She was imprisoned at Grini concentration camp in September 1943, but fell ill and died at UllevÃ¥l Hospital in December.

Lange was a member of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights.

<text>A management system is a set of policies, processes and procedures used by an organization to ensure that it can fulfill the tasks required to achieve its objectives. These objectives cover many aspects of the organization&#x27;s operations (including product quality, worker management, safe operation, client relationships, regulatory conformance and financial success). For instance, a quality management system enables organizations to improve their quality performance, an environmental management system enables organizations to improve their environmental performance, and an occupational health and safety management system enables organizations to improve their occupational health and safety performance, can be run in an integrated management system.

The international standard ISO 9000:2015 (Title: Quality management systems - fundamentals and vocabulary) defines the term in chapter 3.5.3 as a &quot;set of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization to establish policies and objectives, and processes to achieve those objectives&quot;.

A simplification of the main aspects of a management system is the 4-element &quot;plan, do, check, act&quot; approach. A complete management system covers every aspect of management and focuses on supporting the performance management to achieve the objectives. The management system should be subject to continuous improvement as the organization learns.

== Examples ==
Examples of management system standards include:
* ISO 9000: standards for quality management systems (QMS)
* ISO 13485: standard for medical devices
* ISO 14000: standards for environmental management systems
* ISO/IEC 20000: standards for service management systems (SMS)
* ISO 22000: standards for food safety management systems (FSMS)
* ISO/IEC 27000: standards for information security management systems (ISMS)
* ISO 30301: standard for records (information and documentation)
* ISO 37001: standard for anti-bribery
* ISO 45001: standard for occupational health and safety management systems

<text>George Colman (21 October 1762 â 17 October 1836), known as &quot;the Younger&quot;, was an English dramatist and miscellaneous writer. He was the son of George Colman the Elder.

==Life==
He passed from Westminster School to Christ Church, Oxford, and King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen, and was finally entered as a student of law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London. While in Aberdeen, he published a poem satirizing Charles James Fox, called &quot;The Man of the People.&quot; In 1782 he produced his first play, &quot;The Female Dramatist&quot;, at his father&#x27;s playhouse in the Haymarket.
The failing health of the elder Colman obliged him to relinquish the management of the Haymarket theatre in 1789, when the younger George succeeded him, at a yearly salary of Â£600. On the death of the father the patent was continued to the son; however, difficulties arose, as he was involved in litigation with Thomas Harris and was unable to pay the expenses of the performances at the Haymarket. He was forced to take sanctuary within the Rules of the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. He resided for many years while he continued to direct the affairs of his theatre.

Released through the kindness of George IV, who had appointed him exon. of the Yeomen of the Guard, a dignity Colman disposed to the highest bidder. In 1824, the duke of Montrose- then Lord Chamberlain- made him the examiner of plays. He held this position until his death, to the disgust of all contemporary dramatists, to whose manuscripts he was illiberal and severe equally. Although his own productions were open to charges of indecency and profanity, he censored othersâ work to the extent that he would not pass even such words as &quot;heaven&quot;, &quot;providence&quot; or &quot;angel&quot;.

He had, as early as 1784, contracted a runaway marriage with an actress, Clara Morris, to whose brother David Morris, he disposed of his share in the Haymarket theatre eventually. He wrote many of the leading parts in his plays for Maria Gibbs (nÃ©e Logan) especially, whom he married at Clerkenwell in June 1836 after the death of his first wife that January.

He died in Brompton, London. He was buried alongside his father in Kensington Church.

==Works==
His comedies are a curious mixture of genuine comic force and sentimentality. A collection of them was published (1827) in Paris, with a life of the author, by J. W. Lake.

His first play, &quot;The Female Dramatist&quot; (1782), for which Smollett&#x27;s &quot;Roderick Random&quot; supplied the materials, was unanimously condemned, but &quot;Two to One&quot; (1784) was entirely successful. It was followed by &quot;Turk and no Turk&quot; (1785), a musical comedy; &quot;Inkle and Yarico&quot; (1787), an opera; &quot;Ways and Means&quot; (1788); &quot;The Surrender of Calais&quot; (1791); &quot;The Battle of Hexham&quot; (1793); &quot;The Iron Chest&quot; (1796), taken from William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Caleb Williams&quot;; &quot;The Heir at Law&quot; (1797), which enriched the stage with one immortal character, &quot;Dr Pangloss&quot; (borrowed of course from Voltaire&#x27;s Candide); &quot;The Poor Gentleman&quot; (1802); &quot;John Bull, or an Englishman&#x27;s Fireside&quot; (1803), his most successful piece; and numerous other pieces, many of them adapted from the French. His comic opera &quot;Love Laughs at Locksmiths&quot; is the first known appearance of the folk song &quot;The Unfortunate Miss Bailey&quot;, which became a popular hit in early 1800&#x27;s New York. The song was later included in folk song collections including the Burl Ives songbook, and was recorded by The Kingston Trio on their album Here We Go Again! in 1959. Folklorists at the Traditional Ballad Index attribute authorship of the song to either of the George Colmans, but surmise that the Younger is the more likely.

Colman, whose witty conversation made him a favourite, was also the author of a great deal of so-called humorous poetry (mostly coarse, though much of it was popular) â &quot;My Night Gown and Slippers&quot; (1797), reprinted under the name of &quot;Broad Grins&quot;, in 1802; and &quot;Poetical Vagaries&quot; (1812). Some of his writings were published under the assumed name of Arthur Griffinhood of Turnham Green.

==Literary hoaxes==
After his death, Colman was stated falsely to have been the author of certain pornographic works. &quot;The Rodiad&quot;, on flagellation, was published by John Camden Hotten in 1871, dated to 1810 and ascribed to Colman falsely; the true author may have been Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton. Canadian author John Glassco maintained and extended the hoax in 1967 by repeating the attribution and also claiming that Colman wrote his &quot;Squire Hardman&quot;.

<text>George Colman (April 1732 â 14 August 1794) was an English dramatist and essayist, usually called &quot;the Elder&quot;, and sometimes &quot;George the First&quot;, to distinguish him from his son, George Colman the Younger. He also owned a theatre.

==Early life==
He was born in Florence, where his father was stationed as British Resident Minister (diplomatic envoy) at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Colman&#x27;s father died within a year of his son&#x27;s birth and William Pulteney- afterwards Lord Bath- whose wife was Mrs. Colman&#x27;s sister, undertook to educate the boy. After he received private education in Marylebone, George attended Westminster School.

Colman left school in due course for Christ Church, Oxford. There he made the acquaintance of the parodist Bonnell Thornton, with whom he co-founded &quot;The Connoisseur&quot; (1754â1756), a periodical which &quot;wanted weight,&quot; as Johnson said, although it reached its 140th number. He left Oxford after taking his degree in 1755 and, having been entered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn before his return to London, he was called to the bar in 1757. The friendship he formed with David Garrick did not advance his career as a barrister, but he continued to practise until the death of Lord Bath, out of respect for his wishes.


==Plays==
In 1760, Colman produced his first play, &quot;Polly Honeycomb&quot;, which met with great success. In 1761, &quot;The Jealous Wife&quot;, a comedy founded partly on &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, made Colman famous. The death of Lord Bath in 1764 placed him in possession of independent means. In 1765, his metrical translation of the plays of Terence appeared and, in 1766, he produced &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot; jointly with Garrick, whose refusal to take the part of Lord Ogleby led to a quarrel between the two authors. In the next year he purchased a fourth share in the Covent Garden Theatre, which- allegedly- induced General Pulteney to revoke a will by which he had left Colman large estates. The general, who died that year, did, however, leave him a considerable annuity. A riot took place at the third performance of his play &quot;The Oxonian in Town&quot; on 9 November 1767, which a claque of card-sharpers apparently started.

==Theatre ownership==
Colman was the acting manager of Covent Garden for seven years, during which he produced several &quot;adapted&quot; plays of Shakespeare. He also directed Mary Bulkley, Ann Catley and others in the premiÃ¨re of &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; there in 1773. In 1768 he was elected to the Literary Club, then nominally consisting of twelve members. In 1771 Thomas Arne&#x27;s masque &quot;The Fairy Prince&quot; premiÃ¨red at Covent Garden, for which Colman wrote the libretto. In 1774 he sold his share in the playhouse to James Leake, which had involved him in much litigation with his partners, and purchased the little theatre in the Haymarket from Samuel Foote three years later, broken in health and spirits by then. Colman experienced paralysis in 1785; in 1789 his brain became affected and he died on 14 August 1794. He was buried in Kensington Church.

==Other works==
Besides the works already cited, Colman was author of adaptations of Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Bonduca&quot;, Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene&quot; and &quot;Volpone&quot;, Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot;, and of other plays. He also produced an edition of the works of Beaumont and Fletcher (1778), a version of the &quot;Ars PoÃ«tica&quot; of Horace, an excellent translation from the &quot;Mercator&quot; of Plautus for Bonnell Thornton&#x27;s edition (1769â1772), some thirty plays, and many parodies and occasional pieces. An incomplete edition of his dramatic works was published in 1777 in four volumes.

<text>James Hogg (1770 â 21 November 1835) was a Scottish poet, novelist and essayist who wrote in both Scots and English. As a young man he worked as a shepherd and farmhand, and was largely self-educated through reading. He was a friend of many of the great writers of his day, including Sir Walter Scott, of whom he later wrote an unauthorised biography. He became widely known as the &quot;Ettrick Shepherd&quot;, a nickname under which some of his works were published, and the character name he was given in the widely read series &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot;, published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He is best known today for his novel &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;. His other works include the long poem &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Wake&quot; (1813), his collection of songs &quot;Jacobite Relics&quot; (1819), and his two novels &quot;The Three Perils of Man&quot; (1822), and &quot;The Three Perils of Woman&quot; (1823).

==Biography==

===Early life===
James Hogg was born on a small farm near Ettrick, Selkirkshire, Scotland in 1770 and was baptised there on 9 December, his actual date of birth having never been recorded. His father, Robert Hogg (1729â1820), was a tenant farmer while his mother, Margaret Hogg (nÃ©e Laidlaw) (1730â1813), was noted for collecting native Scottish ballads. Margaret Laidlaw&#x27;s father, known as Will o&#x27; Phawhope, was said to have been the last man in the Border country to speak with the fairies. James was the second eldest of four brothers, his siblings being William, David, and Robert (from eldest to youngest). Robert and David later emigrated to the United States, while James and William remained in Scotland for their entire lives.

James attended a parish school for a few months before his education was stopped due to his father&#x27;s bankruptcy as a stock-farmer and sheep-dealer. Robert Hogg was then given the position of shepherd at Ettrickhouse farm by one of his neighbours. James worked as a farm servant throughout his childhood, tending cows, doing general farm work, and acting as a shepherd&#x27;s assistant. His early experiences of literature and story telling came from the Bible and his mother&#x27;s and uncle&#x27;s stories. In 1784 he purchased a fiddle with money that he had saved, and taught himself how to play it. In 1785 he served a year working for a tenant farmer at Singlee. In 1786 he went to work for Mr. Laidlaw of Ellibank, staying with him for eighteen months. In 1788 he was given his first job as a shepherd by Laidlaw&#x27;s father, a farmer at Willenslee. He stayed here for two years, learning to read while tending sheep, and being given newspapers and theological works by his employer&#x27;s wife.
In 1790 he began ten years of service to James Laidlaw of Blackhouse in the Yarrow valley. Hogg later said that Laidlaw was more like a father to him than an employer. Seeing how hard he was working to improve himself, Laidlaw offered to help by making books available for Hogg from his own library, and through a local lending library. Hogg also began composing songs to be sung by local girls. He became a lifelong friend of his master&#x27;s son, William Laidlaw, himself a minor writer and later the amanuensis of Walter Scott. It was at this time that Hogg, his eldest brother, and several cousins, formed a debating society of shepherds.

Hogg first became familiar with the work of the recently deceased Robert Burns in 1797, after having the poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot; read to him. During this period Hogg wrote plays and pastorals, and continued producing songs. His work as a sheep drover stimulated an interest in the Scottish Highlands. In 1800 he left Blackhouse to help take care of his parents at Ettrickhouse. Early in 1801 he published a booklet &quot;Scottish Pastorals&quot;. His patriotic song &quot;Donald Macdonald&quot;, printed as a broadside probably in 1803, achieved considerable popularity.

===Career===
In 1801 Hogg was recruited to collect ballads for Walter Scott&#x27;s collection &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;. He met Scott himself the following year and began working for the &quot;Edinburgh Magazine&quot;. In the summer of 1802 he embarked on the first of three tours of the Highlands with a view to securing a farm of his own. He eventually found a farm on Harris but due to trouble with his finances and a legal issue he was unable to secure a lease by 1804. He may not have been really committed to the project in any case. His experiences on his Highland tours were described in letters to Scott which were published in the &quot;Scots Magazine&quot;. On his way back to Ettrickhouse in 1803 he dined with the novelist John Galt in Greenock. In 1805â06 he worked as a shepherd in Dumfriesshire, meeting the poet Allan Cunningham and becoming friends with him and his family. In October 1806 he became the lover of a young woman named Catherine Henderson, and in the same autumn he attempted unsuccessfully to establish himself as an independent farmer.

Hogg&#x27;s first collection, &quot;The Mountain Bard&quot;, was published in February 1807 by Constable. At the end of summer 1807 his daughter by Catherine Henderson was born, baptised on 13 December as Catherine Hogg. In 1837 she married David Lauder and they named their son James Hogg Lauder. Catherine Henderson herself went on to marry David Laidlaw in 1812. Hogg continued working as a sheep-grazer for other farmers, but his debts began to grow throughout 1808â1809. At the end of 1809 he began an affair with Margaret Beattie, and soon after absconded from his creditors, returning in disgrace to Ettrick.

In 1810 Hogg moved to Edinburgh to start a literary career. In March 1810 his daughter by Margaret Beattie was born, christened Elizabeth Hogg in June. At the end of 1810 he met his future wife Margaret Phillips. His magazine &quot;The Spy&quot;, begun in 1810, ended after a year. At this time he became a founder member of a debating society called &quot;The Forum&quot;, eventually serving as its secretary. In 1812 he composed a long poetical work. &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Wake&quot; (the setting of which was the return to Scotland of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1561 after her exile in France) was published early in 1813 and was a success. It was, in the guise of a competition, a collection of verse tales, of which &quot;Kilmeny&quot; became and remained the best known. At the end of 1813 Hogg began writing a narrative poem &quot;Mador of the Moor&quot; set in the central Highlands; he completed it the spring of 1814 but it was not published for another two years.

In 1814 Hogg completed a visionary poetic narrative &quot;The Pilgrims of the Sun&quot; in three weeks, and in the same year he met William Wordsworth and made a visit to the Lake District to see Wordsworth and other poets. In 1815 the Duke of Buccleuch granted him a small farm at Eltrive Moss, where he could live rent-free for his lifetime. He continued to write songs and poems, including &quot;The Field of Waterloo&quot; and &quot;To the Ancient Banner of Buccleuch&quot;. His poem &quot;Mador of the Moor&quot; was published in 1816. Later in the year he published his collection of parodies &quot;The Poetic Mirror&quot;, achieving a marked success.
Hogg first met the publisher William Blackwood in the aftermath of his own publisher John Goldie&#x27;s 1814 bankruptcy, and in 1817 he helped with the start of Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Monthly Magazine&quot;. He published his two volume collection &quot;Dramatic Tales&quot; in May. In 1818 his collection &quot;The Brownie of Bodsbeck; and Other Tales&quot; was published by Blackwood. This work utilized genuine Scottish folklore which Hogg had collected. At this time Hogg was busy with his work &quot;Jacobite Relics&quot;. In 1819 he proposed marriage to Margaret Phillips. At the end of the year he published the first volume of &quot;Jacobite Relics&quot;. He married Margaret Phillips on 28 April 1820. His second tales collection &quot;Winter Evening Tales&quot; was published a month later. At the end of the year his father died. The second volume of &quot;Jacobite Relics&quot; was published in February 1821, and his son James Robert Hogg was born in March 1821. Around this time, Hogg began having serious financial problems.

It was through the &quot;Edinburgh Monthly Magazine&quot;, soon renamed &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, that Hogg found fame, although it was not the sort that he wanted. Launched as a counter-blast to the Whig &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, Blackwood wanted punchy content in his new publication. He found his ideal contributors in John Wilson (who wrote as Christopher North) and John Gibson Lockhart (later Walter Scott&#x27;s son-in-law and biographer). Their first published article, &quot;The Chaldee Manuscript&quot;, a thinly disguised satire of Edinburgh society in biblical language which Hogg started and Wilson and Lockhart elaborated, was so controversial that Wilson fled and Blackwood was forced to apologise. Soon Blackwood&#x27;s Tory views and reviews â often scurrilous attacks on other writers â were notorious, and the magazine, or &quot;Maga&quot; as it came to be known, had become one of the best-selling journals of its day.

But Hogg quickly found himself forced out of the inner circle. As other writers such as Walter Maginn and Thomas de Quincey joined, he became not merely excluded from the lion&#x27;s share of publication in Maga, but a figure of fun in its pages. Wilson and Lockhart were dangerous friends. Hogg&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Author&#x27;s Life&quot; were savagely attacked by an anonymous reviewer, causing Hogg to temporarily break with &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, and go to work for Constable&#x27;s smaller &quot;Edinburgh Magazine&quot;.

In 1822 the &quot;Maga&quot; launched the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot; or &quot;Nights at Ambrose&#x27;s&quot;, imaginary conversations in a drinking-den between semi-fictional characters such as North, O&#x27;Doherty, The Opium Eater and the Ettrick Shepherd. The Shepherd was Hogg. The &quot;Noctes&quot; continued until 1834, and were written after 1825 mostly by Wilson, although other writers, including Hogg himself, had a hand in them. The Shepherd of the &quot;Noctes&quot; is a part-animal, part-rural simpleton, and part-savant. He became one of the best-known figures in topical literary affairs, famous throughout Britain and its colonies. Quite what the real James Hogg made of this is mostly unknown, although some of his letters to Blackwood and others express outrage and anguish.
Hogg&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Works&quot; in four volumes were published in 1822, as was his novel &quot;The Three Perils of Man&quot;. In 1823, in debt to Blackwood, Hogg began publishing his work &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Calendar&quot; in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;. Hogg&#x27;s daughter Jessie was born in April, and later in the year he published his novel &quot;The Three Perils of Woman&quot;. In June 1824 he published his best known work, the novel &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;. His epic poem &quot;Queen Hynde&quot; was published at the end of the year. In 1825 he found a new and lucrative market for his works as he began publishing in a literary annual called the &quot;Literary Souvenir&quot;.

In 1825 Hogg&#x27;s daughter Maggie was born, and he began writing a new prose work, later titled &quot;Tales of the Wars of Montrose&quot;. In 1826 Hogg was in serious trouble with his debts, while the firm of Constable collapsed, involving Walter Scott and Hogg&#x27;s friend John Aiken. In 1827 his debts began to lighten as his &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Calendar&quot; pieces were being published, and he was getting more and more applications to contribute to annuals. The death of his father-in-law, whose family Hogg had been supporting, gave him relief. His third daughter Harriet was born at the end of the year. Hogg&#x27;s collection &quot;Select and Rare Scotish Melodies&quot; was published in 1829, and he continued to write songs and contribute to annuals throughout 1828â29, while &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Calendar&quot; was published in book form in Spring, 1829.

===Later life===
In 1830 he started publishing in the new &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which helped to alleviate a further financial crisis, and at the end of the year he met with Walter Scott for the last time. In early 1831 Hogg&#x27;s &quot;Songs, by The Ettrick Shepherd&quot; was published, but the publishing of the companion volume &quot;A Queer Book&quot; was held up by Blackwood. Hogg&#x27;s last child, his daughter Mary, was born in August. At the end of the year he quarrelled with Blackwood, and decided to publish his works in London. In 1832 his &quot;Altrive Tales&quot; was published in London, while Blackwood finally published &quot;A Queer Book&quot; in April or May. Hogg was offered a large sum to edit a collection of the works of Robert Burns, but the bankruptcy of his London publisher stopped the publication of his &quot;Altrive Tales&quot; after the first of the twelve projected volumes.

In 1833 Hogg had an accident while curling, falling through the ice, causing a serious illness. In 1834 his biographical work &quot;Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott&quot; was published in the United States, while a pirated version published in Glasgow led to a break with Lockhart. Hogg mended his relationship with Blackwood in May, but Blackwood died at the end of the year. Hogg published &quot;Tales of the Wars of Montrose&quot; in March 1835.

===Death===

James Hogg died on 21 November 1835 and was buried in Ettrick Churchyard, close to his childhood home in the Scottish Borders. In 2021, it was reported that his grave had been preemptively toppled by Scottish Borders Council out of safety concerns and that independent restoration efforts were planned by the community.

Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg&quot;, written on 30 November, nine days after Hogg&#x27;s death, includes the lines:

&lt;poem&gt;The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,
&#x27;Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
And death upon the braes of Yarrow,
Has closed the Shepherd-poet&#x27;s eyes.&lt;/poem&gt;

This eulogy notwithstanding, Wordsworth&#x27;s notes state &quot;He was undoubtedly a man of original genius, but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions.&quot;

==Legacy==

Among the reading public at large Hogg was, during his lifetime, one of the most admired writers of the day, but this admiration was largely for his success in overcoming the disadvantages of his peasant birth and lack of education. He was considered a man of great natural genius whose uncouth style and subject-matter, so natural for the clownish figure depicted in the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot;, should not be held against him. A collected edition of his works was published in the 1830s, after Hogg&#x27;s death, pruned of some passages which offended the increasing delicacy of the age, and another &quot;Works of the Ettrick Shepherd&quot; was prepared in the 1860s which took the process even further; some works, for example &quot;The Three Perils of Woman&quot;, were excluded altogether. Victorian readers of these emasculated texts naturally came to the conclusion that Hogg had been overrated, and that he was notable mainly as an example of triumph over adverse circumstances. Apart from &quot;Justified Sinner&quot;, which even his detractors acknowledged as unusually powerful (and often attributed to someone else, usually Lockhart), his novels were regarded as turgid, his verse as light, his short tales and articles as ephemera.

This situation only began to change in 1924, when the French writer AndrÃ© Gide was loaned &quot;Justified Sinner&quot; by Raymond Mortimer. Gide was amazed, writing that &quot;It is long since I can remember being so taken hold of, so voluptuously tormented by any book.&quot; Its republication in 1947, with an enthusiastic introduction by Gide, helped bring about the modern critical and academic appreciation of this novel. Growing interest in &quot;The Confessions&quot; led to the rediscovery and reconsideration of his other work in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Now his novel &quot;The Three Perils of Woman&quot; is also considered a classic and all his work, including his letters, is undergoing major publication in the Stirling/South Carolina editions. However, &quot;Justified Sinner&quot; remains his most important work and is now seen as one of the major Scottish novels of its time, and absolutely crucial in terms of exploring one of the key themes of Scottish culture and identity: Calvinism. In a 2006 interview with Melvyn Bragg for ITV1, Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh cited Hogg, especially &quot;The Confessions&quot; as a major influence on his writing. A James Hogg Society was founded in 1981 to encourage the study of his life and writings. Hogg&#x27;s story &quot;The Brownie of the Black Haggs&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 2003 by Scottish playwright Marty Ross as part of his &quot;Darker Side of the Border&quot; series. More recently Ross returned to the villain of that story, Merodach, making him the villain of a Doctor Who audiobook, &quot;Night&#x27;s Black Agents&quot; (Big Finish Productions 2010), in which this demonic figure assumes the pose of a Minister of the Kirk.

Thomas Wilson&#x27;s Opera, &quot;The Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot; (1972â75), commissioned by Scottish Opera, is based on the novel.

A bill he issued to purchase Â£50 worth of lambs in 1824 is exhibited in the Museum on the Mound, Edinburgh.

Hogg is a direct ancestor of Nobel Prize-winning Canadian writer Alice Munro.

<doc id="221374" wikidata="Q2395922" url="?curid=221374" title="Transatlantic telegraph cable">
<text>Transatlantic telegraph cables were undersea cables running under the Atlantic Ocean for telegraph communications. Telegraphy is a largely obsolete form of communication, and the cables have long since been decommissioned, but telephone and data are still carried on other transatlantic telecommunications cables. 

The Atlantic Telegraph Company led by Cyrus West Field constructed the first transatlantic telegraph cable. The project began in 1854 with the first cable laid from Valentia Island off the west coast of Ireland to Bay of Bulls, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland. The first communications occurred on August 16, 1858, but the line speed was poor. The first official telegram to pass between two continents that day was a letter of congratulations from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to President of the United States James Buchanan. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed after three weeks when Wildman Whitehouse applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the cable&#x27;s faulty manufacture, storage and handling would have caused its premature failure in any case. Its short life undermined public and investor confidence and delayed efforts to restore a connection.
The second cable was laid in 1865 with improved material. It was laid from the ship SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, built by John Scott Russell and Isambard Kingdom Brunel and skippered by Sir James Anderson. More than halfway across, the cable broke, and after many rescue attempts, it was abandoned. In July 1866 a third cable was laid from The Anglo-American Cable house on the Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum. On July 13, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; steamed westward to Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland, and on July 27 the successful connection was put into service. The 1865 cable was also retrieved and spliced, so two cables were in service. These cables proved more durable. Line speed was very good, and the slogan &quot;Two weeks to two minutes&quot; was coined to emphasize the great improvement over ship-borne dispatches. The cables altered the personal, commercial and political relations between people across the Atlantic. Since 1866, there has been a permanent cable connection between the continents.

In the 1870s, duplex and quadruplex transmission and receiving systems were set up that could relay multiple messages over the cable. Before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas had occurred only by ship and could be delayed for weeks by severe winter storms. By contrast, the transatlantic cable made possible a message and response on the same day.

==Early history==
In the 1840s and 1850s several people proposed or advocated construction of a telegraph cable across the Atlantic, including Edward Thornton and Alonzo Jackman.

As early as 1840 Samuel F. B. Morse proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the Atlantic Ocean. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That year, Bishop John T.Â Mullock, head of the Catholic Church in Newfoundland, proposed a telegraph line through the forest from St.Â John&#x27;s to Cape Ray and cables across the Gulf of St.Â Lawrence from Cape Ray to Nova Scotia across the Cabot Strait.

Around the same time, a similar plan occurred to Frederic Newton Gisborne, a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851 he procured a grant from the Newfoundland legislature and, having formed a company, began building the landline.

== A plan takes shape ==
In 1854, businessman and financier Cyrus West Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.

Field was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse and Lieutenant Matthew Maury, an authority on oceanography. The charts Maury constructed from soundings in the logs of multiple ships indicated that there was a feasible route across the Atlantic. It seemed so ideal for cable laying that Maury named it Telegraph Plateau. Maury&#x27;s charts also indicated that a route directly to the US was too rugged to be tenable and considerably longer. Field adopted Gisborne&#x27;s scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking and promoted the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.

The first step was to finish the line between St.Â John&#x27;s and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Field&#x27;s brother, Matthew. In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was laid out from a barque in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a gale rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a steamboat was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid. The project&#x27;s final cost exceeded $1Â million, and the transatlantic segment would cost much more.

In 1855, Field crossed the Atlantic, the first of 56 crossings in the course of the project, to consult with John Watkins Brett, the greatest authority on submarine cables at the time. Brett&#x27;s Submarine Telegraph Company laid the first ocean cable in 1850 across the English Channel, and his English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company had laid a cable to Ireland in 1853, the deepest cable to that date. Further reasons for the trip were that all the commercial manufacturers of submarine cable were in Britain, and Field had failed to raise significant funds for the project in New York.

Field pushed the project ahead with tremendous energy and speed. Even before forming a company to carry it out, he ordered of cable from the Gutta Percha Company. The Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed in October 1856, with Brett as president and Field as vice president. Charles Tilston Bright, who already worked for Brett, was made chief engineer, and Wildman Whitehouse, a medical doctor self-educated in electrical engineering, was appointed chief electrician. Field provided a quarter of the capital himself. After the remaining shares were sold, largely to existing investors in Brett&#x27;s company, an unpaid board of directors was formed, which included William Thomson (the future Lord Kelvin), a respected scientist. Thomson also acted as a scientific advisor. Morse, a shareholder in the Nova Scotia project and acting as the electrical advisor, was also on the board.

== First transatlantic cable ==

The cable consisted of 7 copper wires, each weighing 26Â kg/km (107Â pounds per nautical mile), covered with three coats of gutta-percha (as suggested by Jonathan Nash Hearder), weighing 64Â kg/km (261Â pounds per nautical mile), and wound with tarred hemp, over which a sheath of 18 strands, each of 7 iron wires, was laid in a close helix. It weighed nearly 550Â kg/km (1.1Â tons per nautical mile), was relatively flexible, and could withstand tension of several tens of kilonewtons (several tons).

The cable from the Gutta Percha Company was armoured separately by wire-rope manufacturers, the standard practice at the time. In the rush to proceed, only four months were allowed for the cable&#x27;s completion. As no wire-rope maker had the capacity to make so much cable in such a short period, the task was shared by two English firms: Glass, Elliot &amp; Co. of Greenwich and R.S. Newall and Company of Birkenhead. Late in manufacturing, it was discovered that the two batches had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions. This meant that they could not be directly spliced wire-to-wire, as the iron wire on both cables would unwind when it was put under tension during laying. The problem was solved by splicing through an improvised wooden bracket to hold the wires in place, but the mistake created negative publicity for the project.

The British government gave Field a subsidy of Â£1,400 a year (Â£ today) and loaned ships for cable laying and support. Field also solicited aid from the U.S. government, and a bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in Congress. It passed the Senate by only a single vote, due to opposition from protectionist senators. It passed in the House of Representatives despite similar resistance and was signed by President Franklin Pierce.

The first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships HMS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and USS &quot;Niagara&quot;, borrowed from their respective governments. Both were needed as neither could hold 2,500 nautical miles of cable alone. The cable was started at the white strand near Ballycarbery Castle in County Kerry, on the southwest coast of Ireland, on AugustÂ 5, 1857. It broke on the first day, but was grappled and repaired. It broke again over Telegraph Plateau, nearly deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year. of cable were lost, but the remaining were sufficient to complete the task. During this period, Morse clashed with Field, was removed from the board, and took no further part in the enterprise.

The problems with breakage were due largely to difficulty controlling the cable tensions with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out. A new mechanism was designed and successfully tested in the Bay of Biscay with &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in May 1858. On 10 June, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and &quot;Niagara&quot; set sail to try again. Ten days out they encountered a severe storm, and the enterprise was nearly brought to a premature end. The ships were top-heavy with cable, which could not all fit in the holds, and the ships struggled to stay upright. Ten sailors were hurt, and Thomson&#x27;s electrical cabin was flooded. The vessels arrived at the middle of the Atlantic on JuneÂ 25 and spliced cable from the two ships together. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; payed out eastwards towards Valentia Island, and &quot;Niagara&quot; westward towards Newfoundland. The cable broke after less than , again after about , and for a third time when about had been run out of each vessel.

The expedition returned to Queenstown, County Cork, Ireland. Some directors were in favour of abandoning the project and selling off the cable, but Field persuaded them to keep going. The ships set out again on 17 July, and the middle splice was finished on 29 July 1858. The cable ran easily this time. &quot;Niagara&quot; arrived in Trinity Bay, Newfoundland on 4 August, and the next morning the shore end was landed. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; arrived at Valentia Island on 5 August; the shore end was landed at Knightstown and laid to the nearby cable house.

==First contact==


Test messages were sent from Newfoundland beginning 10 August 1858. The first was successfully read at Valentia on 12 August and in Newfoundland on 13 August. Further test and configuration messages followed until 16 August, when the first official message was sent via the cable:

Next was the text of a congratulatory telegram from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan at his summer residence in the Bedford Springs Hotel in Pennsylvania, expressing hope that the cable would prove &quot;an additional link between the nations whose friendship is founded on their common interest and reciprocal esteem&quot;. The President responded: &quot;It is a triumph more glorious, because far more useful to mankind, than was ever won by conqueror on the field of battle. May the Atlantic telegraph, under the blessing of Heaven, prove to be a bond of perpetual peace and friendship between the kindred nations, and an instrument destined by Divine Providence to diffuse religion, civilization, liberty, and law throughout the world.&quot;

The messages were hard to decipher; Queen Victoria&#x27;s message of 98 words took 16Â hours to send. Nonetheless, they engendered an outburst of enthusiasm. The next morning a grand salute of 100 guns resounded in New York City, streets were hung with flags, bells of the churches were rung, and at night the city was illuminated. On 1 September there was a parade, followed by an evening torchlight procession and a fireworks display that caused a fire in the Town Hall. Bright was knighted for his part, the first such honour to the telegraph industry.

==Failure of the first cable==

Operation of the 1858 cable was plagued by conflict between two of the project&#x27;s senior members Thomson and Whitehouse. Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training, but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and given up his medical practice to follow a new career. He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge was gained through practical experience. The two clashed even before the project began, when Whitehouse disputed Thomson&#x27;s law of squares when the latter presented it to a British Association meeting in 1855. Thomson&#x27;s law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation. To test the theory, Bright gave Whitehouse overnight access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company&#x27;s long underground lines. Whitehouse joined several lines together to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declared that there would be no problem. Morse was also present at this test and supported Whitehouse. Thomson believed that Whitehouse&#x27;s measurements were flawed and that underground and underwater cables were not fully comparable. Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed to mitigate the retardation problem. In mid-1857, on his own initiative, he examined samples of copper core of allegedly identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two. But cable manufacture was already underway, and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable, so Field went with the cheaper option.

Another point of contention was the itinerary for deployment. Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions, which would halve the time required. Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress could be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable. Whitehouse overruled Thomson&#x27;s suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage. Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable-laying vessel, but repeatedly found excuses for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the Bay of Biscay, and the two attempts in 1858. In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place, and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflictâbut as Whitehouse continued to evade the voyage, Thomson went alone.

=== Thomson&#x27;s mirror galvanometer ===

After his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required. While waiting for the next voyage, he developed his mirror galvanometer, an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any until then. He requested Â£2,000 from the board to build several, but was given only Â£500 for a prototype and permission to try it on the next voyage. It was extremely good at detecting the positive and negative edges of telegraph pulses that represented a Morse &quot;dash&quot; and &quot;dot&quot; respectively (the standard system on submarine cablesâas, unlike overland telegraphy, both pulses were of the same length). Thomson believed that he could use the instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment even over the vast length of the Atlantic cable. He successfully tested it on of cable in underwater storage at Plymouth.

The mirror galvanometer proved yet another point of contention. Whitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme, driving it with a massive high-voltage induction coil producing several thousand volts, so enough current would be available to drive standard electromechanical printing telegraphs used on inland telegraphs. Thomson&#x27;s instrument had to be read by eye and was not capable of printing. Nine years later, he invented the syphon recorder for the second transatlantic attempt in 1866. The decision to start mid-Atlantic, combined with Whitehouse dropping out of another voyage, left Thomson on board &quot;Agamemnon&quot; sailing towards Ireland, with a free hand to use his equipment without Whitehouse&#x27;s interference. Although Thomson had the status of a mere advisor to engineer C.Â W. de Sauty, it was not long before all electrical decisions were deferred to him. Whitehouse, staying behind in Valentia, remained out of contact until the ship reached Ireland and landed the cable.

Around this time, the board started having doubts over Whitehouse&#x27;s generally negative attitude. Not only did he repeatedly clash with Thomson, but was also critical of Field, and his repeated refusals to carry out his primary duty as chief electrician onboard ship made a very bad impression. With the removal of Morse, Whitehouse had lost his only ally on the board, but at this time no action was taken.

=== Cable is damaged and Whitehouse dismissed ===

When &quot;Agamemnon&quot; reached Valentia on 5 August, Thomson handed over to Whitehouse, and the project was declared a success to the press. Thomson received clear signals throughout the voyage using the mirror galvanometer, but Whitehouse immediately connected his own equipment. The effects of the cable&#x27;s poor handling and design, and Whitehouse&#x27;s repeated attempts to drive up to 2,000Â volts through the cable, compromised the cable&#x27;s insulation. Whitehouse attempted to hide the poor performance and was vague in his communications. The expected inaugural message from Queen Victoria had been widely publicised, and when it was not forthcoming, the press speculated that there were problems. Whitehouse announced that five or six weeks would be required for &quot;adjustments&quot;. The Queen&#x27;s message had been received in Newfoundland, but Whitehouse was unable to read the confirmation copy sent back the other way. Finally, on 17 August, he announced receipt. What he did not announce was that the message had been received on the mirror galvanometer when he finally gave up trying with his own equipment. Whitehouse had the message reentered into his printing telegraph locally so he could send on the printed tape and pretend that it had been received that way.

In September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed altogether. The reaction to the news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax; others pronounced it a stock-exchange speculation. Whitehouse was recalled for the board&#x27;s investigation, and Thomson took over in Valentia, tasked with reconstructing the events that Whitehouse had obfuscated. Whitehouse was held responsible for the failure and dismissed. The cable might have failed eventually anyway, but Whitehouse certainly brought it about much sooner. The cable was particularly vulnerable in the first hundred miles from Ireland, consisting of the old 1857 cable that was spliced into the new lay and known to be poorly manufactured. Samples showed that in places the conductor was badly off-centre and could easily break through the insulation due to mechanical strains during laying. Tests were conducted on samples of cable submerged in seawater. When perfectly insulated, there was no problem applying thousands of volts. However, a sample with a pinprick hole &quot;lit up like a lantern&quot; when tested, and a large hole was burned in the insulation.

Although the cable was never put in service for public use and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing. The collision between the Cunard Line ships &quot;Europa&quot; and &quot;Arabia&quot; was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving Â£50,000. A total of 732 messages were passed before the cable failed.

== Preparing a new attempt ==
Field was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme, and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of Thomas Brassey and John Pender, he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of BICC), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. C.Â F. Varley replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.

In the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300Â pounds per nautical mile (73Â kg/km), coated with Chatterton&#x27;s compound, then covered with four layers of gutta-percha, alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400Â lb/nmi (98Â kg/km). This core was covered with hemp saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by Webster &amp; Horsfall Ltd of Hay Mills Birmingham, each covered with fine strands of manila yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long hundredweight (4000Â lb) per nautical mile (980Â kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old. The Haymills site successfully manufactured of wire (1,600Â tons), made by 250 workers over eleven months.

== &quot;Great Eastern&quot; and the second cable ==

The new cable was laid by the ship SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; captained by Sir James Anderson. Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on 15 July 1865, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; left the Nore for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by &quot;Caroline&quot;. This attempt failed on 2 August when, after had been payed out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.
&quot;Great Eastern&quot; steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus and formed the Anglo-American Telegraph Company, to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On 13 July 1866, &quot;Great Eastern&quot; started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, 27 July, the expedition reached the port of Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland in a thick fog. Daniel Gooch, chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, who had been aboard the &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, sent a message to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Stanley, saying &quot;Perfect communication established between England and America; God grant it will be a lasting source of benefit to our country.&quot; The next morning at 9Â a.m. a message from England cited these words from the leader in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.&quot; The shore end was landed at Heart&#x27;s Content Cable Station during the day by &quot;Medway&quot;. Congratulations poured in, and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States.

In August 1866, several ships, including &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865. Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable, splice it to new cable, and complete the run to Newfoundland. They were determined to find it, and their search was based solely upon positions recorded &quot;principally by Captain Moriarty, R.Â N.&quot;, who placed the end of the lost cable at longitude 

There were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. However, Robert Halpin, first officer of &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, navigated HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; and grappling ship &quot;Albany&quot; to the correct location. &quot;Albany&quot; moved slowly here and there, &quot;fishing&quot; for the lost cable with a five-pronged grappling hook at the end of a stout rope. Suddenly, on 10 August, &quot;Albany&quot; &quot;caught&quot; the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured, and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; and another grappling ship, &quot;Medway&quot;, arrived to join the search on 12 August. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26Â hours to get it safely on board &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. The cable was carried to the electrician&#x27;s room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold and payed out to Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland, where she arrived on Saturday, 7 September. There were now two working telegraph lines.

== Repairing the cable ==
Broken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break was determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable, and a splice was made between the two ends.

==Communication speeds==
Initially messages were sent by an operator using Morse code. The reception was very bad on the 1858 cable, and it took two minutes to transmit just one character (a single letter or a single number), a rate of about 0.1Â words per minute. This was despite the use of the highly sensitive mirror galvanometer. The inaugural message from Queen Victoria took 67Â minutes to transmit to Newfoundland, but it took 16Â hours for the confirmation copy to be transmitted back to Whitehouse in Valentia.

For the 1866 cable, the methods of cable manufacture, as well as sending messages, had been vastly improved. The 1866 cable could transmit 8Â words a minute80Â times faster than the 1858 cable. Oliver Heaviside and Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin in later decades understood that the bandwidth of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive reactance, which causes a severe dispersion and hence a signal distortion; see telegrapher&#x27;s equations. This has to be solved by iron tape or by load coils. It was not until the 20thÂ century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120Â words per minute. London became the world centre in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from Porthcurno Cable Station near Land&#x27;s End and formed with their Commonwealth links a &quot;live&quot; girdle around the world; the All Red Line.

== Later cables ==
Additional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart&#x27;s Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.

The original cables were not fitted with repeaters, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation. Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line. On telegraph lines this is done with relays, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was TAT-1 in 1956. This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.

==Impact==
A 2018 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices. The study estimates that efficiency gains due to the establishment of the telegraph connection amounted to 8 percent of export value.

<text>The Districts of Portugal () are the most important first-level administrative subdivisions of continental Portugal. Currently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts.

As an administrative division, each district serves mainly as the area of jurisdiction of a civil governor, who acts as the local delegate of the Central Government of Portugal.

==Overview==

The Districts of Portugal were established by a royal decree of 18 July 1835. On the Portuguese mainland, they correspond to the current districts, with the exception of SetÃºbal District, which is the result of a split of Lisbon District in 1926. This decree did not affect the then extensive colonial empire.

The 1976 Portuguese Constitution specifies that Portugal has only, as first-level divisions, the autonomous regions (Azores and Madeira) and the administrative regions (to be created in mainland Portugal). According to the Constitution, the districts shall be disestablished in territories in which an autonomous or administrative region has been created.

The districts were abolished in Azores and Madeira in 1976, when the autonomous regions were created. In 1998, a proposal was submitted to referendum to create eight administrative regions in mainland Portugal, and so to extinguish the districts. The proposal was rejected at the ballot box and so the districts continued to exist in mainland Portugal. Despite their abolition in the autonomous regions, the areas of the three former districts of Azores are still used as areas of jurisdiction of some government and non-government entities, like the district finance directorates (Tax Authority regional offices) and the district football championships.

However, the importance of the districts has been decreasing. In recent years, some administrative, financial and political competencies have been delivered to the CCDRs (ComissÃ£o de CoordenaÃ§Ã£o e Desenvolvimento Regional, English: Commission for Regional Coordination and Development) and to the municipalities, to the detriment of the districts. In 2003, the Portuguese municipalities were allowed to organize themselves into intermunicipal communities (&quot;comunidades intermunicipais&quot;) and metropolitan areas (&quot;Ã¡reas metropolitanas&quot;), which allowed for a lessening in the importance of the districts.

Also, the abolition of the districts is a subject that returned to discussion in Portuguese society. In 2009, during the campaign for the legislative election of 2009, the leader of the Socialist Party, JosÃ© SÃ³crates, promised a new referendum to the administrative regions and therefore, the abolition of districts, if he won the election. Other personalities support the creation of administrative regions and therefore the abolition of districts.

Despite being in the process of being phased out by the decentralisation policies of the government, the districts still remain the most relevant subdivision in the country by serving as a basis for a series of administrative divisions such as electoral constituencies, police, and civil protection regional commands; sports district associations; and championships.

On September 8, 2011, a decree from the Portuguese Government &quot;de facto&quot; extinguished all the offices of civil governor by transferring most of their functions to other bodies. As the existence of the civil governors is still included in the Portuguese Constitution, its &quot;de jure&quot; extinction may occur only after a constitutional amendment.

==Present purpose==
In mainland Portugal, for administrative purposes, the districts are still used as the areas of jurisdiction of the local branches and field offices of several Government ministries and agencies. Some of the bodies that have each district as their jurisdiction area are:

* District and metropolitan commands of the Public Security Police;
* Territorial commands of the Portuguese National Republican Guard;
* District rescue operations commands of the National Civil Protection Authority;
* Finance directorates of the Ministry of Finance / Tax and Customs Authority (in this case, including the former districts of Azores, that are still used as the jurisdiction areas for the three finance directorates existing in this autonomous region);
* District Social Security centers of the Portuguese Social Security;
* District motor vehicle delegations of the Mobility and Land Transports Institute;
* District archives of the Directorate-General of Archives;
* Regional delegations of the Estradas de Portugal (Road Agency).

Furthermore:

* The area of each of the 18 electoral constituencies (&quot;cÃ­rculo eleitoral&quot;, electoral circle) of mainland Portugal coincides with the area of each district;
* In the new judicial division of Portugal, the area of each of the &quot;comarcas&quot; (first instance judicial districts) of mainland Portugal coincides with the area of an administrative district (with the exception of the &quot;comarcas&quot; of Greater Lisbon and Greater Porto).

For non-Government purposes, the districts are used as the area of jurisdiction of many entities, including:

* The regional organizations of the major political parties, 
* The regional organizations of most of the Portuguese sports federations (football, athletics, roller skating, etc.) and its district championships (including the three former districts of AÃ§ores);
* Regional federations of trade unions;
* District delegations of the Institutions of Engineers.

==List==

==Former districts of Portugal==
===Azores===
* Angra do HeroÃ­smo District â 1835 to 1976
* Horta District â 1835 to 1976

==Former districts of the Portuguese overseas provinces==
Following the model of European Portugal, the major Portuguese overseas territories (Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese India) were also divided in districts. In these territories, each district was headed by a district governor, subordinated to the governor-general. In Angola and Mozambique, the former district areas mostly coincide with the modern province areas. In the former Portuguese India, the DamÃ£o and Diu districts are still divisions of the present union territory of Daman and Diu, while the present state of Goa (former Goa District) is now divided into two districts.

<text>Edmund Kean (4 November 178715 May 1833) was a British Shakespearean actor, who performed, among other places, in London, Belfast, New York, Quebec, and Paris. He was known for his short stature, tumultuous personal life, and controversial divorce.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Kean was born in Westminster, London. His father was probably Edmund Kean, an architect&#x27;s clerk, and his mother was an actress, Anne Carey, daughter of the 18th-century composer and playwright Henry Carey.

Kean made his first appearance on the stage at age four as Cupid in Jean-Georges Noverre&#x27;s ballet of &quot;Cymon.&quot; As a child, his vivacity, cleverness and ready affection made him a universal favourite, but his harsh circumstances and lack of discipline fostered self-reliance and wayward tendencies. About 1794 a few benevolent persons paid for him to go to school, where he did well; finding the restraint intolerable, however, he went to sea as a cabin boy at Portsmouth. Finding life at sea even more restricting, however, he pretended to be both deaf and lame so skillfully that he deceived the doctors at Madeira.

On his return to England, he sought the protection of his uncle, Moses Kean, a mimic, ventriloquist and general entertainer who, besides continuing his pantomimic studies, introduced him to the study of Shakespeare. At the same time, Charlotte Tidswell, an actress who had been especially kind to him from infancy, taught him the principles of acting.

On the death of his uncle, she took charge of him, and he began the systematic study of the principal Shakespearean characters, displaying the peculiar originality of his genius with interpretations entirely different from those of John Philip Kemble, then considered the great exponent of these roles. Kean&#x27;s talent and interesting countenance caused a Mrs. Clarke to adopt him, but he took offence at the comments of a visitor and left her house suddenly, returning to his old surroundings.

===Discovery===
At age 14, he obtained an engagement to play leading characters for 20 nights in the York Theatre, appearing as Hamlet, Hastings and Cato. Shortly afterwards, while a member of Richardson&#x27;s Theatre, a traveling theatre company, the rumor of his abilities reached George III, who commanded him to appear at Windsor Castle. He subsequently joined Saunders&#x27;s circus, where in the performance of an equestrian feat he fell and broke both legs, the accident leaving traces of swelling in his insteps throughout his life.

At about this time, he picked up music from Charles Incledon, dancing from James Harvey D&#x27;Egville, and fencing from Henry Angelo. In 1807, he played leading parts in the Belfast theatre with Sarah Siddons, who began by calling him &quot;a horrid little man.&quot; Upon further experience of his ability, she said that he &quot;played very, very well,&quot; but that &quot;there was too little of him to make a great actor.&quot; He made an early appearance with Mrs. Baker&#x27;s company. In 1808, he joined the provincial troupe of the actor Samuel Butler, going on to marry Mary Chambers of Waterford, a leading actress, on 17 July. His wife gave birth to two sons, one of whom was the actor Charles Kean.

===Drury Lane and New York===

For several years his prospects were very gloomy, but in 1814 the committee of Drury Lane Theatre, which was on the verge of bankruptcy, resolved to give him a chance among the &quot;experiments&quot; they were making to win a return of their popularity. When the expectation of his first appearance in London was close upon him, he was so feverish that he exclaimed, &quot;If I succeed I shall go mad.&quot; As he was unable to afford medical treatment for some time, his elder son died the day after he signed the three-year Drury Lane contract.

His opening at Drury Lane on 26 January 1814 as Shylock roused the audience to almost uncontrollable enthusiasm. Contemporaries recognized that Kean had brought dignity and humanity to his portrayal of the character. Jane Austen refers to his popularity in a letter to her sister Cassandra dated 2 March 1814: &quot;Places are secured at Drury Lane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean that only a third and fourth row could be got.&quot; Successive appearances in &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; demonstrated his mastery of the range of tragic emotion. His triumph was so great that he himself said on one occasion, &quot;I could not feel the stage under me.&quot;

In 1817, a local playwright named Charles Bucke submitted his play &quot;The Italians, or; The Fatal Accusation&quot; to Drury Lane, for which Kean was to play the lead. The play was well received by both council and actors until Kean seemed to have a change of heart and began to make several offhand remarks that his part was not big enough for him. Then, after a performance in February 1819 where Kean went out of his way to botch the opening night of &quot;Switzerland&quot;, a play by historical novelist Jane Porter, for whom Kean had had a personal dislike, Bucke pulled the play out of contempt for Kean&#x27;s conduct. After much cajoling by the theater staff to perform the play, Mr. Bucke then later had it republished with a preface concerning the incident, including excerpts from correspondence between the involved parties, which was later challenged in two books, &quot;The Assailant Assailed&quot; and &quot;A Defense of Edmund Kean, Esq&quot;. The result was loss of face on both sides, and the play being performed anyway on 3 April 1819 to a disastrous reception, thanks to the controversy already surrounding the play and Kean&#x27;s previous conduct.

On 29 November 1820, Kean appeared for the first time in New York City as Richard III at the Anthony Street Theatre. The success of his visit to America was unequivocal, although he fell into a vexatious dispute with the press. In 1821, he appeared in Boston with Mary Ann Duff in &quot;The Distrest Mother&quot; by Ambrose Philips, an adaptation of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Andromaque&quot;. On 4 June 1821, he returned to England.

Kean was the first to restore the tragic ending to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, which since 1681 had been replaced on stage by Nahum Tate&#x27;s happy ending adaptation &quot;The History of King Lear&quot;. Kean had previously acted Tate&#x27;s Lear, but told his wife that the London audience &quot;have no notion of what I can do till they see me over the dead body of Cordelia.&quot; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as &quot;deeply affecting&quot;; with regret, Kean reverted to Tate.

===Private life===
Kean&#x27;s lifestyle became a hindrance to his career. As a result of his relationship with Charlotte Cox, the wife of a City of London alderman, Kean was sued by Mr. Cox for damages for criminal conversation (adultery). Damages of Â£800 were awarded against him by a jury that had deliberated for just 10 minutes. &quot;The Times&quot; launched a violent attack on him. The adverse decision in the criminal conversation case of Cox v. Kean on 17 January 1825 caused his wife to leave him, and aroused against him such bitter feeling that he was booed and pelted with fruit when he re-appeared at Drury Lane, nearly compelling him to retire permanently into private life. For many years, he lived at Keydell House, Horndean. He also used Walnut Tree Cottage as his residence in the Middlesex village of North End, much closer to London.

===Second American visit===
A second visit to America in 1825 was largely a repetition of the persecution which he had suffered in England. Some cities showed him a spirit of charity, but many audiences subjected him to insults and even violence. In Quebec City, he was much impressed with the kindness of some Huron Indians who attended his performances, and he was purportedly made an honorary chief of the tribe, receiving the name &quot;Alanienouidet&quot;. Kean&#x27;s last appearance in New York was on 5 December 1826 in &quot;Richard III&quot;, the role in which he was first seen in America.

===Decline and death===

He returned to England and was ultimately received with favour, but by now he was so dependent on the use of stimulants that the gradual deterioration of his gifts was inevitable. Still, his great powers triumphed during the moments of his inspiration over the absolute wreck of his physical faculties. His appearance in Paris was a failure owing to a fit of drunkenness. He appeared in the title part of &quot;Ben Nazir&quot; by Thomas Colley Grattan in 1827 as a comeback role at Drury Lane, but the play was not a success. He turned down &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; by James Sheridan Knowles, a role that went to William Macready He took over the management of the Richmond Theatre, Surrey in 1831, continuing in that role until his death two years later. He resided in a house next to the theatre. 

His last appearance on the stage was at Covent Garden on 15 March 1833, when he played Othello to the Iago of his son, Charles Kean, who was also an accomplished actor. At the words &quot;Villain, be sure,&quot; in scene 3 of act iii, he suddenly broke down, and crying in a faltering voice &quot;O God, I am dying. Speak to them, Charles,&quot; fell insensible into his son&#x27;s arms. He died a few weeks later in Surrey, and is commemorated in the Parish Church, where there is a floor plaque marking his grave, as well as a wall plaque that was originally on the outside, but was moved inside and heavily renovated during restoration work in 1904. He is buried in the parish church of All Saints, in the village of Catherington, Hampshire. His last words were alleged to have been &quot;dying is easy; comedy is hard.&quot; In Dublin, Gustavus Vaughan Brooke took up the part of William Tell vacated by Kean.

==Artistic legacy==
According to the &quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, it was in the impersonation of the great creations of Shakespeare&#x27;s genius that the varied beauty and grandeur of the acting of Kean were displayed in their highest form, although probably his most powerful character was Sir Giles Overreach in Philip Massinger&#x27;s &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot;, the effect of his first performance of which was such that the pit rose en masse, and even the actors and actresses themselves were overcome by the terrific dramatic illusion. His main disadvantage as an actor was his small stature. Coleridge said, &quot;Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning.&quot;

==Eccentricity==
His eccentricities at the height of his fame were numerous. For example, he chose his dinner according to the role he was to play: for a tyrant he would eat pork, for a murderer beef and for a lover mutton.

Sometimes he would ride recklessly on his horse, Shylock, throughout the night. He was presented with a tame lion with which he might be found playing in his drawing-room. The prize-fighters Mendoza and Richmond the Black were among his visitors and Henry Grattan was his devoted friend.

==Appraisals==

In his earlier days, FranÃ§ois Talma said of him, &quot;He is a magnificent uncut gem; polish and round him off and he will be a perfect tragedian.&quot; William Macready, who was much impressed by Kean&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; and met the actor at supper, speaks of his &quot;unassuming manner ... partaking in some degree of shyness&quot; and of the &quot;touching grace&quot; of his singing. Kean&#x27;s delivery of the three words &quot;I answerâNo!&quot; in the part of Sir Edward Mortimer in &quot;The Iron Chest&quot;, cast Macready into an abyss of despair at rivalling him in this role. So full of dramatic interest is the life of Edmund Kean that it formed the subject for the play &quot;Kean&quot; by Jean-Paul Sartre as well as a play by Alexandre Dumas, entitled &quot;Kean, ou DÃ©sordre et gÃ©nie&quot;, in which the actor FrÃ©dÃ©rick LemaÃ®tre achieved one of his greatest triumphs.

In 1924 director Alexandre Volkoff adapted the Dumas play into a French silent feature film starring Russian actor Ivan Mosjoukine, who was then living in Paris. Kean: Genius or Scoundrel (Italian: Kean - Genio e sregolatezza) co-written, directed by and starring Vittorio Gassman, is a 1956 Italian dramatization of the life of Kean. It is based on the drama play Kean (1836) by Alexandre Dumas and its 1953 adaptation by Jean-Paul Sartre. It was screened at the Locarno Film Festival in 1957. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Gianni Polidori. Much of the film was shot at the Teatro Valle in Rome.

==Theatrical works==
Several theatrical works have been based on Kean&#x27;s life:
* &quot;Kean&quot;, a drama by Alexandre Dumas, pÃ¨re, 1836
* &quot;Kean&quot;, a comedy by Jean-Paul Sartre, 1953 (produced 1954 with Pierre Brasseur, revived London 1990 starring Derek Jacobi and in 2007 starring Antony Sher)
* &quot;Kean&quot;, a Broadway musical by Peter Stone, Robert Wright, and George Forrest, 1961
*&quot; Kean&quot;, 1978, a BBC Play of the Month with Anthony Hopkins
*&quot; Kean&quot;, 1983, a YTV biography with Ben Kingsley
* &quot;Kean IV&quot;, a tragicomedy by Grigoriy Gorin, 1991

==Cultural influence==
The acclaimed latter 20th-century British theatre and film actor Peter O&#x27;Toole owned a finger-ring that had once belonged to Kean, and used it as a literary muse for the writing of the second volume of his autobiography &quot;Loitering with Intent: The Apprentice&quot; (1997). O&#x27;Toole delivered the line, &quot;dying is easy; comedy is hard&quot; and attributed it to the last words of Kean in the 1982 movie &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;.

<text>Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory (; 15 March 1852 â 22 May 1932) was an Anglo-Irish dramatist, folklorist and theatre manager. With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles that occurred in Ireland during her lifetime.

Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival. Her home at Coole Park in County Galway served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important as her creative writings for that theatre&#x27;s development. Lady Gregory&#x27;s motto was taken from Aristotle: &quot;To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and marriage===
Gregory was born at Roxborough, County Galway, the youngest daughter of the Anglo-Irish gentry family Persse. Her mother, Frances Barry, was related to Viscount Guillamore, and her family home, Roxborough, was a 6,000-acre (24Â km2) estate located between Gort and Loughrea, the main house of which was later burnt down during the Irish Civil War. She was educated at home, and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse (i.e. nanny), Mary Sheridan, a Catholic and a native Irish speaker, who introduced the young Augusta to the history and legends of the local area.

She married Sir William Henry Gregory, a widower with an estate at Coole Park, near Gort, on 4 March 1880 in St. Matthais&#x27; Church, Dublin. Sir William, who was 36 years her elder, had just retired from his position as Governor of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), having previously served several terms as Member of Parliament for County Galway. He was a well-educated man with many literary and artistic interests, and the house at Coole Park housed a large library and extensive art collection, both of which Lady Gregory was eager to explore. He also had a house in London, where the couple spent a considerable amount of time, holding weekly salons frequented by many leading literary and artistic figures of the day, including Robert Browning, Lord Tennyson, John Everett Millais and Henry James. Their only child, Robert Gregory, was born in 1881. He was killed during the First World War while serving as a pilot, an event which inspired W. B. Yeats&#x27;s poems &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death&quot;, &quot;In Memory of Major Robert Gregory&quot; and &quot;Shepherd and Goatherd&quot;.

===Early writings===

The Gregorys travelled in Ceylon, India, Spain, Italy and Egypt. While in Egypt Lady Gregory met, and in 1882 and 1883 had an affair with, the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Sonnets&quot;.

Her earliest work to appear under her own name was &quot;Arabi and His Household&quot; (1882), a pamphletâoriginally a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;âin support of Ahmed Orabi Pasha, leader of what has come to be known as the Urabi Revolt, an 1879 Egyptian nationalist revolt against the oppressive regime of the Khedive and the European domination of Egypt. She later said of this booklet, &quot;whatever political indignation or energy was born with me may have run its course in that Egyptian year and worn itself out&quot;. Despite this, in 1893 she published &quot;A Phantom&#x27;s Pilgrimage, or Home Ruin&quot;, an anti-Nationalist pamphlet against William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s proposed second Home Rule Act. The unsigned pamphlet features Egyptian gods sitting in judgment upon Gladstone, and his phantom being shown the results of high taxes and the English government. As James Pethica writes, &quot;With its uncompromising portrayal of a country sliding into anarchy and ruin, the anonymous pamphlet drew appreciative comment from those of Gregory&#x27;s London friends who knew it to be her work. &#x27;It has been a success,&#x27; she noted in her diary[.]&quot;

She continued to write prose during the period of her marriage, including short stories she published under the name &quot;Angus Grey.&quot; During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title &quot;An Emigrant&#x27;s Notebook&quot;, but this plan was abandoned. &quot;An Emigrant&#x27;s Note Book&quot; remained unpublished until it appeared in Lady Gregory&#x27;s Early Irish Writings 1883-1893 (2018). She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called &quot;Over the River&quot;, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband&#x27;s autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, &quot;If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me richâ&#x27;full&#x27;, as Bacon says.&quot;

===Cultural nationalism===
A trip to Inisheer in the Aran Islands in 1893 re-awoke for Lady Gregory an interest in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort workhouse. One of the tutors she employed was Norma Borthwick, who would visit Coole numerous times. This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material, including &quot;A Book of Saints and Wonders&quot; (1906), &quot;The Kiltartan History Book&quot; (1909) and &quot;The Kiltartan Wonder Book&quot; (1910). She also produced a number of collections of &quot;Kiltartanese&quot; versions of Irish myths, including &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; (1902) and &quot;Gods and Fighting Men&quot; (1903). (&quot;Kiltartanese&quot; is Lady Gregory&#x27;s term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in Kiltartan.) In his introduction to &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; Yeats wrote &quot;I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time&quot;. James Joyce was to parody this claim in the Scylla and Charybdis chapter of his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Towards the end of 1894, encouraged by the positive reception of the editing of her husband&#x27;s autobiography, Lady Gregory turned her attention to another editorial project. She decided to prepare selections from Sir William Gregory&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s correspondence for publication as &quot;Mr Gregory&#x27;s Letter-Box 1813â30&quot; (1898). This entailed her researching Irish history of the period; one outcome of this work was a shift in her political position, from the &quot;soft&quot; Unionism of her earlier writing on Home Rule to a definite support of Irish nationalism and Republicanism, and to what she was later to describe as &quot;a dislike and distrust of England&quot;.

===Founding of the Abbey===
Edward Martyn was a neighbour of Lady Gregory, and it was during a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats. Discussions between the three of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn&#x27;s &quot;The Heather Field&quot; and Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Countess Cathleen&quot;.

The Irish Literary Theatre project lasted until 1901, when it collapsed owing to lack of funding. In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, John Millington Synge, Ã, Annie Horniman and William and Frank Fay came together to form the Irish National Theatre Society. The first performances staged by the society took place in a building called the Molesworth Hall. When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to meet the needs of the society.

On 11 May 1904, the society formally accepted Horniman&#x27;s offer of the use of the building. As Horniman was not normally resident in Ireland, the Royal Letters Patent required were paid for by her but granted in the name of Lady Gregory. One of her own plays, &quot;Spreading the News&quot;, was performed on the opening night, 27 December 1904. At the opening of Synge&#x27;s &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; in January 1907, a significant portion of the crowd rioted, causing the remainder of the performances to be acted out in dumbshow. Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did, but she defended Synge as a matter of principle. Her view of the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots: &quot;It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don&#x27;t.&quot;

===Later career===
In July 1925, &quot;The Travelling Man&quot; by Lady Gregory was broadcast by the nascent British Broadcasting Company&#x27;s 2LO (London) station.

She remained an active director of the theatre until ill-health led to her retirement in 1928. During this time she wrote more than 19 plays, mainly for production at the Abbey. Many of these were written in an attempted transliteration of the Hiberno-English dialect spoken around Coole Park that became widely known as Kiltartanese, from the nearby village of Kiltartan. Her plays had been among the most successful at the Abbey in the earlier years, but their popularity declined. Indeed, the Irish writer Oliver St. John Gogarty once wrote &quot;the perpetual presentation of her plays nearly ruined the Abbey&quot;. In addition to her plays, she wrote a two-volume study of the folklore of her native area called &quot;Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland&quot; in 1920. She also played the lead role in three performances of &quot;Cathleen Ni Houlihan&quot; in 1919.

During her time on the board of the Abbey, Coole Park remained her home; she spent her time in Dublin staying in a number of hotels. For example, at the time of the 1911 national census, she was staying in a hotel at 16 South Frederick Street. In these she dined frugally, often on food she had brought with her from home. She frequently used her hotel rooms to interview would-be Abbey dramatists and to entertain the company after opening nights of new plays. She spent many of her days working on her translations in the National Library of Ireland. She gained a reputation as being a somewhat conservative figure. For example, when Denis Johnston submitted to the Abbey his first play, &quot;Shadowdance&quot;, it was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with &quot;The Old Lady says No&quot; written on the title page. Johnston decided to rename the play, and &quot;The Old Lady Says &#x27;No!&#x27; &quot; was eventually staged by the Gate Theatre in 1928.

===Retirement and death===

When she retired from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory returned to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy. Her Galway home had long been a focal point for the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Ã, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, SeÃ¡n O&#x27;Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: &quot;The Wild Swans at Coole&quot;, &quot;I walked among the seven woods of Coole&quot;, &quot;In the Seven Woods&quot;, &quot;Coole Park, 1929&quot; and &quot;Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931&quot;.

In 1932, Lady Gregory, whom Shaw once described as &quot;the greatest living Irishwoman&quot;, died at home aged 80 from breast cancer, and is buried in Bohermore Cemetery, Galway. The entire contents of Coole Park were auctioned three months after her death, and the house was demolished in 1941.

==Legacy==
Her plays fell out of favour after her death, and are now rarely performed. Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published, providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century.

Her &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; is still considered a good retelling of the Ulster Cycle tales such as Deidre, Cuchulainn, and the TÃ¡in BÃ³ CÃºailnge stories. Thomas Kinsella wrote &quot;I emerged with the conviction that Lady Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Cuchul-ian of Muirthemne&quot;, though only a paraphrase, gave the best idea of the Ulster stories&quot;. However her version omitted some elements of the tale, usually assumed to avoid offending Victorian sensibilities, as well being an attempt as presenting a &quot;respectable&quot; nation myth for the Irish, though her paraphrase is not considered dishonest. Other critics find the bowdlerisations in her works more offensive, not only the removal of references to sex and bodily functions, but also the loss of Cuchulain&#x27;s &quot;battle frenzy&quot; (&quot;RÃ­astrad&quot;); in other areas she censored less than some of her male contemporaries, such as Standish O&#x27;Grady.

In 2019, the New York Public Library announced a major exhibition on Gregory and her work, &quot;All This Mine Alone: Lady Gregory and the Irish Literary Revival,&quot; to be co-curated by James Pethica and Colm ToÃ­bÃ­n. The exhibition opened in March 2020 but closed do to the global pandemic; an online version remains available. In conjunction with the exhibition, The Irish Repertory Theatre of New York and the Druid Theatre of Galway offered a major revival of some of Gregory&#x27;s plays. In November 2020 it was announced that Trinity College Dublin, whose library&#x27;s forty busts previously represented men only was commissioning four additional busts of women and that one of them would be a bust of Lady Gregory. In 2023 Gregory was the subject of a two-part RTÃ documentary starring Miriam Margolyes and Senator Lynn Ruane, and featuring commentary from Roy Foster, James Pethica, Judith A. Hill, Melissa Sihra, and other Gregory scholars.

<text>The Counties of Denmark () were former subdivisions of metropolitan Denmark and overseas territories, used primarily for administrative regions, with each county having its own council with substantial powers. Originally there had been twenty-four counties, but the number was reduced to roughly fourteen in 1970 â the number fluctuated slightly over the next three decades. In 2006 there were thirteen traditional counties as well as three municipalities with county status (the island of Bornholm, which was a county from 1660 until 2002, became a &quot;regional municipality&quot; with county powers, but only briefly from 2003 until 2006). On 1 January 2007, as a result of the &quot;strukturreformen&quot;, the counties were abolished and replaced by five larger &quot;regions&quot; which, unlike the counties, are not municipalities.

Copenhagen County comprised all the municipalities of Metropolitan Copenhagen, except Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg Municipality which, on account of their peculiarity of being outside any of the traditional counties, had the equivalent of &quot;county status&quot;. On 1 January 2007 these two municipalities lost their special status.

Greenland and the Faroe Islands are also part of the Danish Realm, but both enjoy internal autonomy. Both are largely self-governing, and each community sends two members to the Danish Parliament. The Faroe Islands obtained self-government in 1948; from 1816 to 1948 the islands had the status of a Danish county. Greenland changed from a colony to an overseas county in 1953, and subsequently gained home rule in 1979.

==Abolition==
A government proposal in 2004 called for the counties to be abolished and replaced by five large regions with health care as their main responsibilities: two regions in Jutland, two regions in Zealand and one region covering Funen and the southernmost part of Jutland. The proposal also required the municipalities to merge reducing them from 271 to 98, with a minimum of 20,000 inhabitants in each municipality, although some exceptions were made to this rule. In 2007, 25 municipalities had fewer than 30,000 inhabitants each, with the average number of inhabitants over 55,500 per municipality. Only the United Kingdom and Ireland had more populous entities at the lowest political administrative level. 

The reform was confirmed by the Danish Parliament on 24 February 2005 and the counties were abolished on 1 January 2007.

==List of counties (1970â2006)==
The counties and county-level municipalities are listed below.

RingkjÃ¸bing County used an old spelling of its name, while its capital city and state authorities used the modern Danish spelling, RingkÃ¸bing.

The archipelago Ertholmene, located northeast of Bornholm, have never been a part of a municipality, county, or (from 2007) region. Statistics Denmark calls them ChristiansÃ¸ and FrederiksÃ¸, named after the two inhabited islets. They are included in numbers for Denmark (92 inhabitants; 0.39 square kilometers). The land area of Denmark is 42,394 square kilometers.

<doc id="221379" wikidata="Q209731" url="?curid=221379" title="Parma wallaby">
<text>The parma wallaby (Notamacropus parma) is a small marsupial macropod mammal native to forests and densely-vegetated areas of northeastern New South Wales, Australia, close to the border with Queensland. There is also an introduced population found in and around Rodney District, just north of Auckland, New Zealand. About the size of a stout cat, it lives mainly under thick plant cover, and is only active at night when it emerges to feed on grasses and small plants. It is the smallest of the wallabies (short, kangaroo-like marsupial mammals of the genus &quot;Notamacropus&quot;) and carries its young in a pouch, as with other marsupials. Shy and elusive, it was believed extinct until its rediscovery in the 1960s. 

Parma wallabies are threatened by habitat loss, and, in addition to native predators (such as birds of prey, monitor lizards, and snakes), they are easily preyed upon by dingoes and non-native feral cats and red foxes.

==Taxonomy==
The parma wallaby was first described by British naturalist John Gould in about 1840. Its epithet &quot;parma&quot; (Waterhouse 1845) comes after a word from a New South Wales Aboriginal language, but the exact source word and language have not been identified.

In 2019, a reassessment of macropod taxonomy determined that &quot;Osphranter&quot; and &quot;Notamacropus&quot;, formerly considered subgenera of &quot;Macropus&quot;, should be moved to the genus level. This change was accepted by the Australian Faunal Directory in 2020.

==Rediscovery and sightings==
A shy cryptic creature of the wet sclerophyll forests of northern New South Wales (Australia), it was never commonly-encountered and, even before the end of the 19th century, it was believed to be extinct. 

In 1965, workers on Kawau Island, New Zealand (near Auckland), trying to control a plague of introduced tammar wallabies (a widespread and fairly common species in Australia), were astonished to discover that some of the animals were not truly tammar wallabies, but a miraculously surviving population of parma wallabies - a species long-thought extinct. The extermination effort was put on-hold while individuals were captured and sent to institutions in Australia and around the world in the hope that they would breed in captivity and could eventually be reintroduced to their native habitat.

The renewed interest in the parma wallaby soon led to another milestone: in 1967 it was found that they still existed in the forests near Gosford, New South Wales. Further investigation showed that the parma wallaby was alive and well, and although not common, was to be found in forests along the Great Dividing Range from near Gosford almost as far north as the Queensland border.

The offspring of the Kawau Island population are smaller than their fully-wild, Australian relatives, even when provided with ample food; it appears that competition, for limited food resources on the island, selects for smaller individuals, an incipient example of the evolutionary phenomenon of insular dwarfism.

==Description==
The parma wallaby is the smallest member of the genus &quot;Notamacropus&quot;, at between , less than one-tenth the size of the red kangaroo. It is about in length, with a sparsely furred, blackish tail about the same length again. The fur is a reddish or greyish brown above, greyer about the head, and fading to pale grey underneath. Presumably, individuals had been sighted many times during the years when it was &quot;extinct&quot;, but mistaken for an especially slender and long-tailed example of the otherwise similar red-legged and red-necked pademelons.

==Habitat and behaviour==
The Parma wallaby inhabits wet sclerophyll (hard-leaved) forests of northern New South Wales, Australia. Like the pademelon, it prefers forest with thick undergrowth, and grassy patches, although parma wallabies are also found occasionally in dry eucalypt forest and even rainforest. It is mainly nocturnal and usually shelters in thick scrub during the day, through which it can travel at speed along the runways it makes. It emerges from cover shortly before dusk to feed on grasses and herbs in forest clearings. The parma wallaby is largely solitary, with two or at most three animals sometimes coming together to feed in favourable circumstances.

==Status==
The species remains rarely seen, with some evidence for a recent population decline. It is classified as Near Threatened according to the 2015 IUCN assessment.

Nagasaki Prefecture has a population of 1,314,078 (1 June 2020) and has a geographic area of 4,130 km2 (1,594 sq mi). Nagasaki Prefecture borders Saga Prefecture to the northeast.

Nagasaki is the capital and largest city of Nagasaki Prefecture, with other major cities including Sasebo, Isahaya, and Åmura. Nagasaki Prefecture is located in western KyÅ«shÅ« with a territory consisting of many mainland peninsulas centered around Åmura Bay, as well as islands and archipelagos including Tsushima and Iki in the Korea Strait and the GotÅ Islands in the East China Sea. Nagasaki Prefecture is known for its century-long trading history with the Europeans and as the sole place of direct trade and exchange between Japan and the outside world during the &quot;Sakoku&quot; period. Nagasaki Prefecture is home to several of the Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region which have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==
Nagasaki Prefecture was created by merging of the western half of the former province of Hizen with the island provinces of Tsushima and Iki. Facing China and Korea, the region around Hirado was a traditional center for traders and pirates.

During the 16th century, Catholic missionaries and traders from Portugal arrived and became active in Hirado and Nagasaki, which became a major center for foreign trade. After being given free rein in Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s period, the missionaries were forced out little by little, until finally, in the Tokugawa era, Christianity was banned under the &quot;Sakoku&quot; national isolation policy: Japanese foreign trade was restricted to Chinese and Dutch traders based at Dejima in Nagasaki. However, &quot;Kirishitan&quot; (Japanese Christian) worship continued underground. These &quot;Kakure Kirishitan&quot; (hidden Christians) were tried at every step, forced to step on &quot;fumi-e&quot; (&quot;trample pictures&quot;, images of the Virgin Mary and saints) to prove that they were non-Christian. With the banishment of all Catholic missionaries, traders from Catholic countries were also forced out of the country. Along with them, their children, half Japanese and half European, were forced to leave. The majority was sent to Jagatara (Jakarta) and are still remembered by the locals as the people who wrote the poignant letters which were smuggled across the sea to their homeland.

Today, Nagasaki has prominent Catholic churches, and the Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region, have been included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

During the Meiji Restoration, Nagasaki and Sasebo became major ports for foreign trade, and eventually major military bases and shipbuilding centers for the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries up to World War II. On August 9, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, which destroyed all buildings in a radius from the point of impact and extensively damaged other parts of the city. Roughly 39,000 people were killed, including 27,778 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean forced workers, and 150 Japanese soldiers. About 68-80% of the industrial production was destroyed to the point it would not recover for months or at least a year.
Nagasaki Prefecture contains many areas prone to heavy rain and subsequent landslide damage. In July 1957, mainly in the Isahaya area, damage from heavy rains, flooding and landslides lead to a death toll of 586, with 136 people missing and 3,860 injured. In July 1982, typhoon damage in the Nagasaki area lead to 299 fatalities, according to a report by the Japanese government.

== Geography ==
Nagasaki borders Saga Prefecture on the east, and is otherwise surrounded by water, including Ariake Bay, the Tsushima Straits (far from Busan and South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea), and the East China Sea. It also includes a large number of islands such as Tsushima, Iki and Goto. Most of the prefecture is near the coast and there are a number of ports such as Nagasaki and a United States Navy base at Sasebo.

As of 1 April 2014, 18% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Saikai and Unzen-Amakusa National Parks; Genkai and Iki-Tsushima Quasi-National Parks; and HokushÅ, Nishi Sonogi HantÅ, Nomo HantÅ, Åmurawan, Shimabara HantÅ, and Taradake Prefectural Natural Parks.

<text>Araucariaceae is a family of conifers with three living genera, &quot;Araucaria&quot;, &quot;Agathis&quot;, and &quot;Wollemia&quot;. While the family&#x27;s native distribution is now largely confined to the Southern Hemisphere, except for a few species of &quot;Agathis&quot; in Malesia, it was formerly widespread in the Northern Hemisphere during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

==Description==

Members of Araucariaceae are typically extremely tall evergreen trees, reaching heights of or more. They can also grow very large stem diameters; a New Zealand kauri tree (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;) named &quot;TÄne Mahuta&quot; (&quot;The Lord of the Forest&quot;) has been measured at tall with a diameter at breast height of . Its total wood volume is calculated to be , making it the third-largest conifer after &quot;Sequoia&quot; and &quot;Sequoiadendron&quot; (both from the Cupressaceae subfamily Sequoioideae).

The trunks are columnar and have relatively large piths with resinous cortices. The branching is usually horizontal and tiered, arising regularly in whorls of three to seven branches or alternating in widely separated pairs.

The leaves can be small, needle-like, and curved, or they can be large, broadly ovate, and flattened. They are spirally arranged, persistent, and usually have parallel venation.

Like other conifers, they produce cones. Each tree can have both male and female cones (monoecious) or they can have only male or female cones (dioecious).

Male cones are among the largest among all conifer cones, on average. They are cylindrical and drooping, somewhat resembling catkins. They are borne singly on the tips of branches or the axils of leaves. They contain numerous sporophylls arranged in whorls or spirals. Each has four to 20 elongated pollen sacs attached to the lower surface at one end. The pollen grains are round and do not possess wings or air sacs.

Female cones are also very large. They are spherical to ovoid in shape and borne erect on thick, short shoots at branch tips. The numerous bracts and scales are either fused to each other or separate for half of their lengths. The scales almost always bear only one seed on its upper surface, in contrast to two in true pines (family Pinaceae). They are very large, among the largest seeds among conifers. They are dispersed by wind, usually using wing-like structures. On maturity, the female cones detach and fall to the ground. Due to their size, they can cause serious injuries if they hit a person. The cones of the bunya bunya, &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot;, for example, weigh up to , about the size and weight of a large pineapple. They can drop from heights of .

==Classification and genera==

Araucariaceae is classified under the order Pinales, class Pinopsida of the division Pinophyta. The division includes all living conifers. Recently however, some authorities treat Araucariaceae as a separate order, Araucariales.

Araucariaceae contains three extant genera and about 41 species.
==Phylogeny==
Below is the phylogeny of the Pinophyta based on cladistic analysis of molecular data. It shows the position of Araucariaceae within the division.

Relationships between living members of Araucariaceae.
Molecular evidence supports Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae having diverged from each other during the late Permian.

==Distribution and habitat==
Today, 41 species are known, in three genera: &quot;Agathis&quot;, &quot;Araucaria&quot; and &quot;Wollemia&quot;, distributed largely in the Southern Hemisphere.

By far the greatest diversity is in New Caledonia (18 species), with others in Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Chile, southern Brazil, and Malesia. In Malesia, &quot;Agathis&quot; extends a short distance into the Northern Hemisphere, reaching 18Â°N in the Philippines.

==Uses==

Several species are very popular ornamental trees in gardens in subtropical regions, and some are also very important timber trees, producing wood of high quality. Several have edible seeds similar to pine nuts, and others produce valuable resin and amber. In the forests where they occur, they are usually dominant trees, often the largest species in the forest; the largest is &quot;Araucaria hunsteinii&quot;, reported to 89 m tall in New Guinea, with several other species reaching 50â65 m tall. &quot;A. heterophylla&quot;, the Norfolk Island pine, is a well-known landscaping and house plant from this taxon.

Skillful artisans in the Erzurum Province, Turkey, have used fossilized wood of Araucariaceae for centuries to manufacture jewelry and decorative items. It is known as &quot;Oltustone&quot;, the name deriving from the town of Oltu, where it is most commonly excavated. Despite the fact that this semiprecious gemstone is classified as &quot;stone&quot;, wood anatomy reveals it was fossilized pieces of trunks of Araucariacea. Oltustone, also called âBlack Amberâ is unique to Turkey. It is dull and black, but when polished, acquires an attractive black sheen.

==Fossil record==
Fossils widely believed to belong to Araucariaceae include the form genera &quot;Araucarites&quot; (various), &quot;Agathoxylon&quot; and &quot;Araucarioxylon&quot; (wood), &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot; (leaves), &quot;Araucariacites&quot; and &quot;Dilwynites&quot; (pollen), and &quot;Protodammara&quot; (cones).

The oldest definitive records of Araucariaceae are from the Early Jurassic, though there are potential earlier Late Triassic records. Early representatives of &quot;Araucaria&quot; are widespread across both hemispheres by the Middle Jurassic, such as &quot;Araucaria mirabilis&quot; and &quot;Araucaria sphaerocarpa&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina and England respectively. The oldest records of the &quot;Wollemia&quot;-&quot;Agathis&quot; lineage from the Cretaceous, including &quot;Emwadea microcarpa&quot; from the Albian aged Winton Formation of Australia and &quot;Wairarapaia mildenhallii&quot; from the Albian-Cenomanian of New Zealand. The oldest fossils currently confidently assignable to &quot;Agathis&quot; are those of &quot;Agathis immortalis&quot; from the Salamanca Formation of Patagonia, which dates to the Paleocene, approximately 64.67â63.49 million years ago. &quot;Agathis&quot;-like leaves are also known from the slightly older LefipÃ¡n Formation of the same region, which date to the very end of the Cretaceous. Araucariaceae fossils are also known from the latest Oligocene or earliest Miocene of the southwesternmost tip of Africa. Claimed records of &quot;Agathis&quot; from the Eocene of Canada based on chemical analysis of amber are questionable.

<text>Jean-Georges Noverre (29 April 1727 19 October 1810) was a French dancer and ballet master, and is generally considered the creator of &quot;ballet d&#x27;action&quot;, a precursor of the narrative ballets of the 19th century. His birthday is now observed as International Dance Day.

His first professional appearances occurred as a youth in Paris at the OpÃ©ra-Comique, at Fontainebleau, in Berlin before Frederick II and his brother Prince Henry of Prussia, in Dresden and Strasburg. In 1747 he moved to Strasbourg, where he remained until 1750 before moving to Lyon. In 1751, he composed his first great work, &quot;Les FÃªtes Chinoises&quot; for Marseilles. The work was revived in Paris in 1754 to great acclaim. In 1755, he was invited by Garrick to London, where he remained for two years.

Between 1758 and 1760 he produced several ballets at Lyon, and published his &quot;&quot;. It is from this period that the revolution in the art of the ballet for which Noverre was responsible can be dated. Prior to Noverre, ballets were large spectacles that focused mainly on elaborate costumes and scenery and not on the physical and emotional expression of the dancers. He was next engaged by Duke Karl Eugen of WÃ¼rttemberg, and later Austrian Empress Maria Theresa, until 1774. In 1776, he was appointed &quot;maÃ®tre des ballets&quot; of the Paris Opera at the request of Queen Marie Antoinette. He returned to Vienna in Spring of 1776 to stage ballets there, but in June 1776 he returned again to Paris. He regained this post until the French Revolution reduced him to poverty. He died on 19 October 1810 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
Noverre&#x27;s friends included Voltaire, Mozart, Frederick the Great and David Garrick (who called him &quot;the Shakespeare of the dance&quot;). The ballets of which he was most proud were his &quot;La Toilette de VÃ©nus&quot;, &quot;Les Jalousies du sÃ©rail&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Amour corsaire&quot; and &quot;Le Jaloux sans rival&quot;. Besides the &quot;Lettres sur la danse&quot;, Noverre wrote &quot;Observations sur la construction d&#x27;une nouvelle salle de l&#x27;OpÃ©ra&quot; (1781); &quot;Lettres sur Garrick Ã©crites Ã  Voltaire&quot; (1801); and &quot;Lettre Ã  un artiste sur les fÃªtes publiques&quot; (1801).

== Early life and career ==
In 1774 King Louis XV died and Noverre&#x27;s dear friend Marie-Antoinette became the Queen of France. Marie-Antoinette did not forget about her dear Dance Master, and appointed Noverre to the Paris Opera. This was Noverre&#x27;s shining moment, but the loyalty and backing of Marie-Antoinette could switch. In 1779 Noverre was unseated from his position because Dauberval, Maximilien Gardel and Mlle Guimard gathered prominent people and poisoned them against Noverre. However, Noverre didn&#x27;t leave the Opera until 1781. Noverre&#x27;s fitting effect on the Paris ballet world would be preserved by the production of his tragic ballet &quot;Jason et MÃ©dÃ©e&quot; in 1763. In 1787, Pierre Gardel inherited the throne and Paris Opera, and carried out Noverre&#x27;s ideas on costume and thoughts on ballet pantomime. (Chazin-Bennhaum) He composed &quot;Les Caprices de GalathÃ©e&quot;, for example, and garbed his dancers in tiger skins and shoes made of tree bark. His naturalist attitude towards costume placed him in the front rank of the French Enlightenment.

== &quot;Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets&quot; ==
=== Context ===
Noverre&#x27;s treatise on dancing and theater expressed his aesthetic theories on the production of ballets and his method of teaching ballet. Noverre wrote this text in London in 1756 and published it in 1760 in Lyon, France. He began his research for his essays in Drury Lane, London, where he choreographed for his own troupe of dancers at the Theatre Royal under the direction of David Garrick. It was in David Garrick&#x27;s library that Noverre read modern French literature and ancient Latin treatises on pantomime. Noverre was inspired by the pantomimes that he thought stirred up the audience&#x27;s emotions by the use of expressive movement. He proclaimed in his text that ballet should unfold through dramatic movement, and the movement should express the relationship between the characters. Noverre named this type of ballet, ballet dâaction or pantomime ballet (International Dictionary of Ballet 1032). From 1757 to 1760, he produced thirteen new works with composer FranÃ§ois Granier at the Lyon Opera. His lighter, colorful pantomime ballets like &quot;Les Caprices de GalathÃ©e&quot;, &quot;La Toilette de VÃ©nus&quot;, and &quot;Les Jalousies du sÃ©rail&quot;, received great success.

=== Inspiration ===
Noverre was most immediately influenced by Jean-Philippe Rameau, David Garrick, and Marie SallÃ©. Rameau was a very influential French composer and music theorist, and Noverre was inspired by his dance music that combined programmatic and strongly individual elements. David Garrick was an actor and theatre director at the Theatre Royal. Noverre was inspired by his talent for &quot;histrionics&quot; and vivid mime work where Noverre wanted to shake from the traditional forms of Ballet. (The Encyclopedia of Dance and Ballet 695).

With the content that follows it is imperative to closer examine the profound influence of Marie SallÃ© on Jean-George Noverre. SallÃ© and Noverre had an intertwining history that began at the Paris Opera Ballet. SallÃ© had studied in Paris with FranÃ§oise PrÃ©vost, who was a known predecessor of dramatizing ballet with her virtuosic acting and expressive performance. * Salle had studied in Paris with Francoise Prevost who was an established predecessor of the dramatic style of ballet demonstrated through her virtuosic acting and expressive performances. SallÃ© made her debut at the Paris Opera in 1727 where she established a reputation for her âdelicate grace and expressive mimeâ abilities.

SallÃ©&#x27;s London season of 1733-34 at Covent Garden saw her two pantomimesâPygmalion and Bacchus and Ariadneâwhich were both staged in the spring of 1734. Additionally, she collaborated with the naturalised British composer George Frideric Handel during his 1734-35 London Opera season during which her pantomimes became a forerunner of Noverre&#x27;s ballet d&#x27;action--. When she returned to Paris in 1735, she choreographed and danced in scenes for Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s Opera-ballets. Although she retired from the public stage in 1741, she continued to influence the dance community through her coaching and choreographic innovations at OpÃ©ra-Comique in 1743, which happens to be when Noverre made his debut.

Social and economic factors, in what was unequivocally a âmanâs worldâ allowed Noverre to bring forth his ideologies surrounding the evolution of dance. By contrast, the recognition given to SallÃ© was largely limited to her significance as a performer. Her role as a creative choreographer, and progressive innovator was not only ignored during her lifetime, but it has failed to have been recognized by historians of the dance arts even to this day. Blanked for her virtuosic movements and expressive talents, SallÃ© laid the foundations for which Noverre was able to move forward. Her choreographic work in Pygmalion brought forth a combination of expressive gestures and dance movements to mediate its narrative. Although historians have grappled with the duality of SallÃ©&#x27;s role in dance history, it is precisely these aspects that deem her the true inventor of the ballet d&#x27;action that was to sweep the late eighteenth-century stage under Noverre&#x27;s creative efforts and leadership.

In addition to her performance and choreographic work, SallÃ© worked to create reforms within the rigid ballet world predating Noverre. SallÃ© revolutionized ballet by her combination of artistic dance movement, the expressive use of gestures matched to the music, and her redesign of costumes and stage scenery in unique ways that broke new ground in the dance world. The simple act of omitting the Mask and the reworking of costumes was later picked up by Noverre in his Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets. SallÃ©&#x27;s shifting public image, influenced the reception of her costume reforms. She was performing at the time when the dancersâ costumes were not realistic. Noverre&#x27;s notion of costume reform clearly stemmed from his association with her. Although he is recognized for his rejection of the dancer&#x27;s mask, it is most probable that his action would have been motivated by SallÃ©&#x27;s ânoble, expressive and spiritual countenance,â which inspired particular comment in his Letter.

When contemplating the speed of Noverre&#x27;s rapid shifts in style, one has to consider all the work SallÃ© created before him. Given her background and genderâwith all its discriminatory limitationsâSallÃ©&#x27;s achievements were nothing short of incredible. Given the continuing battle for gender equality in the contemporary world of both business and the business of the arts world, her accomplishments are even more extraordinary recognizing that they were done in the 18th century, a time when men held all the most important positions of influence and power in the theatrical world, as well as the political world. Going against the grain of a woman&#x27;s role being limited to interpret the dance creations of men, SallÃ© broke barriers to stage and perform her own creations. One cannot recognize the work of Noverre&#x27;s innovations without including the paradigm shifts that grew out of her life and work.

=== Content ===

Noverre&#x27;s text demanded an end to repressive traditions peculiar to the Paris Opera Ballet, such as stereotypical and cumbersome costumes, and old-fashioned musical styles and choreography. Noverre also discussed the methods for training dancers such as encouraging a student to capitalize on his or her own talents (The Encyclopedia of Dance and Ballet 699). Most of Noverre&#x27;s criticisms of dance in his book were directed towards the Paris Opera Ballet because he felt the Paris Opera Ballet created ballets that were an isolated event within Opera lacking meaningful connection with the main theme of the Opera. He criticized the Paris Opera Ballet use of the mask because it restricted the dancer from showing facial expressions that could bear meaning on their characters. Noverre devoted the whole of his Ninth Letter to the subject of masks and wrote, &quot; Destroy the masks and&quot; he argued, &quot;we shall gain a soul, and be the best dancers in the world.&quot;
Noverre specifically dealt with seven major points in his treatise:
# Regarding the training of dancers, he emphasized that correctness in dance technique as laid down by Pierre Beauchamp and others must be held with sensitivity to the individual&#x27;s anatomy.
# Of prime concern, the pedagogical consideration of the dancer&#x27;s personality and style is prerequisite to artistic development.
# Noverre stressed that within a dramatic context, validity and sincerity of gestural expression are of the utmost importance in creating a ballet.
# Noverre called for the logical development of plots. According to Noverre, plots should be thematically integrated with movement. Additionally, all superfluous solos and irrelevant dance techniques should be omitted from the ballet.
# Noverre was adamant that music be appropriately suited to the dramatic development of the plot.
# He insisted that costumes, dÃ©cor, and lighting be compatible with the introduction, plot, and climax of each act within the ballet.
# With the disappearance of masks in his own ballets, Noverre pronounced his advanced ideas on stage make-up for dancers that would allow for the dancer&#x27;s expression to be seen rather than hidden behind a mask (Lee 111).

=== Impact ===
Noverre&#x27;s &quot;Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets&quot; had lasting impact on ballet ideology as his text has been printed in almost every European language and his name is one of the most frequently quoted in the literature of dance (Lynham 13). Many of his theories have been implemented in dance classes today and remain a part today&#x27;s ideology of dance. For example, his idea that a teacher should encourage students to profit from his or her own talents rather than to imitate a teacher or the style of a popular dancer is a present ideology of dance. Noverre did receive criticism from many of his prominent ballet contemporaries, however his theories have survived longer than any of his ballets, which have not been reproduced for at least two centuries (Lynham 127).

=== &quot;Lettres sur la Danse&quot; in English ===
&quot;Lettres sur la danse&quot; was first published in English in 1782, where it was titled &quot;The Works of Monsieur Noverre translated from the French&quot;. The translator, Parkyns MacMahon, also translated Noverre&#x27;s ballet &quot;Adela of Ponthieu&quot;, and was in touch with him while working on &quot;The Works of Monsieur Noverre&quot;. In 2014, MacMahon&#x27;s translation was transcribed with commentary by Michael Burden and Jennifer Thorp, and published with eight essays by dance historians and musicologists as &quot;The Works of Monsieur Noverre Translated from the French: Noverre, His Circle, and the English&quot; Lettres sur la Danse (Hillsdale, New York: Pendragon, 2014). Although snippets appear in &quot;Letters on Dancing and Ballets&quot; (London: Beaumont, 1930), by Cyril Beaumont, the Burden and Thorp transcription is the only complete English translation.

The essays in the volume, which cover a number of aspects of Noverre&#x27;s life and career in depth are as follows: Jennifer Thorp: From &quot;Les fÃªtes chinoises&quot; to &quot;Agamemnon revenged&quot;: Ange Goudar as commentator on the ballets of Jean-Georges Noverre; Samantha Owens: &quot;Just as great as Noverre&quot;: the ballet composer Florian Johann Deller (1729â73) and music at the WÃ¼rttemberg court; Kathleen Kuzmick Hansell: Noverre in Milan: a turning point; Adeline Mueller: A peep into Mozart and Le Picq&#x27;s Serraglio (Milan, 1772): Noverre&#x27;s tragic reworking of a comic ballet; Edward Nye: Outrageous dancing and respectable Noverre; Bruce Alan Brown: &quot;WeiÃ und Rosenfarb&quot;: the end of Noverrian ballet in Vienna and the beginnings of the Wienerischer Musenalmanach; Michael Burden: Regular meetings: Noverre and Gallini in London, 1756-1795; Anna Karin StÃ¥hle: Jean-Georges Noverre applying for jobs.

== The Jean-Georges Noverre bicentenary ==
To mark the bicentenary of the death of Jean-Georges Noverre, two academic meetings were held which explored aspects of biography, dance, and performance.

The first was âCelebrating Jean-Georges Noverre 1727-1810: his world, and beyondâ, which was the 11th Annual Oxford Dance Symposium on 16â17 April 2010 at New College, Oxford. Some of the papers were included in Burden and Thorp (2014).

The second was the âColloque International Ã  lâoccasion du bicentenaire de la mort de Noverreâ, les jeudi 21, vendredi 22 et samedi 23 octobre 2010, A lâinitiative de LâAssociation pour un Centre de recherches sur les Arts du spectacle aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siÃ¨cles (ACRAS, sociÃ©tÃ© savante), at Centre National de la Danse, 1 rue Victor Hugo â 93500 Pantin, and Maison de la Recherche, 28 rue Serpente, 75006 Paris. The proceedings were published in the &quot;Revue Musicorum&quot;, X. Accueil

<text>Intertemporal equilibrium is a notion of economic equilibrium conceived over many periods of time.

In modern economic theory, most models explicitly take into account the fact that the economy evolves over time, and that its equilibrium cannot be fruitfully analyzed from a purely static perspective. Therefore the general equilibrium of the economy is conceived as an intertemporal equilibrium, meaning that households and firms are assumed to make intertemporal decisions. That is, households are assumed to choose consumption and labor on the basis of wages, prices, utility, and wealth over their whole lifetimes, instead of considering these quantities at just one point in time. Likewise, firms are assumed to choose hiring, investment, and output on the basis of productivity and demand over the foreseeable future, instead of considering these quantities at just one point in time.

The intertemporal general equilibrium is then analyzed as the Nash equilibrium or competitive equilibrium of the intertemporal strategies of all the households and firms (and any other economic agents under consideration, such as governments).

<text>Lorenzo Monaco (1370 â 1425) was a Sienese painter and miniaturist of the late Gothic to early Renaissance age, active principally in Florence. He was born Piero di Giovanni. Little is known about his youth, apart from the fact that he was apprenticed in Florence. He has been considered the last important exponent of the Giotto style, before the Renaissance revolution that came with Fra Angelico and Masaccio.

==Life==
He was probably born in Florence and not in Siena, as it was believed until recently. Nothing is known of his early years, but he was certainly trained in painting in Florence. Formed in the same tradition as Giotto, he was influenced not only by him but also by that artist&#x27;s followers Spinello Aretino and Agnolo Gaddi. He later worked with Gaddi in painting the predella of the altarpiece in the Nobili Chapel in Santa Maria degli Angeli.

In 1390 he entered the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, as a novice, where he took his vows in 1391. Here he worked for a long time as an illuminator in the scriptorium and as a panel painter, consecrating himself at the time as the greatest painter of sacred subjects in Florence. The three chorales in the Laurentian Library date back to the last decade of the 14th century, and where executed for his own Camaldolese monastery, already perceive a personal style, characterized by taut linearism and a cold chromatic range.

Starting from around 1404, his style shows the influence of the International Gothic, influenced by the first works of Lorenzo Ghiberti and of Gherardo Starnina, who had returned in those years from Spain. From that year, stands out The &quot;PietÃ &quot; in the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia of Florence, a work dominated by a nervous line and a certain emotional tension. In the numerous paintings with a gold background, he created a style characterized by extremely elongated figures, with the sinuous lines of the crescent-shaped drapery, sharp edges, the bright and rich colors (profusion of gold and lapis lazuli), the hinted gestures, and an almost annulled space. His works, in general, showed images with a strong spiritual value, detached from reality, where the profane and naturalistic elements are usually almost completely absent.

From this period, among others, can be mentioned the &quot;Tabernacle with the Madonna, Child and Saints&quot;, at the Pinacoteca di Siena, and the beautiful &quot;Oration in the Garden&quot; of the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia, in Florence. The sumptuous &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; of the National Gallery, in London, one of his most famous works dates to 1407-1409. The &quot;Polyptych of Monteoliveto&quot;, in the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia is slightly later, and it is imbued with a spirituality that even preludes Fra Angelico. In the same museum is the &quot;Triptych of San Procolo&quot; where are already notice the wavy rhythms, like the arabesques of an illuminated codex, which appear again in the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; (now at the Uffizi), composed with a great number of saints of sinuous shapes, and with brilliant colors that reach their peak in the blinding white of the Virgin&#x27;s dress and in the ultramarine blue of Christ&#x27;s mantle, seemingly in an authentic irradiation of divine light.

The numerous commissions that he took, led him to request several times dispensations to leave the monastery, which were regularly granted by his superiors, but Lorenzo never forgot his monastic status.

In the last phase of his production, he didn&#x27;t follow the innovations of his contemporaries Masaccio and Filippo Brunelleschi. Although he knew how to update his style with some innovations, especially concerning a more realistic representation of space, he always remained faithful to his personal style, without radical changes. A typical work of this time is the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; of 1420â1422, where the foreshortenings seem markedly incoherent and surreal precisely because the now widespread geometrical perspective is totally absent. However, the pictorial quality remains very high, with an original use of the contour line, which creates one of the most imaginative results of all Florentine painting. 

Lorenzo&#x27;s works remained popular in the 1420s, as testified by the numerous commissions he received, such as the &quot;Stories of the Virgin&quot; in the Bartolini Salimbeni Chapel of Santa Trinita, one of his few frescoes.

Giorgio Vasari, who included his biography in his &quot;Lives&quot;, states that he died at the age of fifty-five, from an unidentified infection, perhaps an infected pustule, gangrene or a tumor, which had forced him to bed for many months. He was buried in the chapter house of the monastery, a privilege usually reserved only for high religious offices and famous personalities, further proof of the great esteem in which he was held in his lifetime.

His production was also very vast in miniature, where he achieved results of great value both at a creative and at a formal level. He also composed musical chants. Many manuscripts illuminated by him are kept in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana.

<doc id="221389" wikidata="Q310687" url="?curid=221389" title="NiccolÃ² Piccinni">
<text>NiccolÃ² Piccinni (; 16 January 1728 â 7 May 1800) was an Italian composer of symphonies, sacred music, chamber music, and opera. Although he is somewhat obscure today, Piccinni was one of the most popular composers of operaâparticularly the Neapolitan opera buffaâof the Classical period.

== Life ==
Piccinni was born in Bari, in the Apulia region. From the age of fourteen, he was educated at the Conservatory of San Onofrio by Leonardo Leo and Francesco Durante, thanks to the intervention of the Bishop of Bari (his father, although himself a musician, was opposed to his son following the same career).

Piccinni&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Le donne dispettose&quot;, was produced in 1755 with the patronage of Prince Vintimille. In 1760 he composed, at Rome, the &quot;chef d&#x27;Åuvre&quot; of his early life, &quot;La Cecchina, ossia la buona Figliuola&quot;, an &quot;opera buffa&quot; with a libretto by Carlo Goldoni, which &quot;enjoyed a two-year run in Rome and was played in all the important European capitals. It can probably be called the most popular opera buffa of the 18th century...[even more than]... Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;La serva padrona&quot;...[and]... The first of the new era, culminating in the masterworks of Mozart.&quot;

&quot;La buona figliuola&quot; represents a special moment in the history of eighteenth-century music in which comedy began to take on a new dramatic force. It is the moment at which the self-consciously sentimental theatrical project of Carlo Goldoni (the opera&#x27;s librettist) is married with the developing musical language of classicism. This can especially be seen in the sensitive writing of Cecchina&#x27;s act 2 aria &quot;Una povera ragazza&quot;.

The opera was such a success that fashions of dress, shops, and houses were all named after &quot;La Cecchina&quot;. It also set off a debate about the merits of the new sentimental style, especially in England, where conservative reactionaries were wary of the supposed feminizing influence of modern Italian music. Antonio Baretti commented in 1768 that individuals âof weight and considerationâ should not be blamed for condemning âthose puny gentlemenâ who, as enthusiasts of Italian opera, were able to âfeel its minuet niceties, and to be of course in rapture with the languishing Cecchinaâs of Piccini .â This modern music, Baretti decried, âfar from having any power of increasing courage or any manly virtues, has on the contrary a tendency towards effeminacy and cowardliness.â

Six years after this, Piccinni was invited by Queen Marie Antoinette to Paris. He became the first Italian after Jean-Baptiste Lully to write operas for the Academie royale de musique (the Paris Opera). He collaborated with the poet and dramatist Marmontel on several projects designed to advance the cause of the operatic reform. Marmontel&#x27;s first librettos took as their foundation texts Philippe Quinault had written for Lully, &quot;Roland&quot; 1778, and &quot;Atys&quot;, 1779. Subsequent works, starting with &quot;Didon&quot;, used original texts. All his later works were successful, but the directors of the Grand Opera conceived the idea of deliberately opposing him to Gluck by persuading the two composers to treat the same subject â &quot;IphigÃ©nie en Tauride&quot; â simultaneously. The Parisian public was divided into two rival parties, which, under the names of Gluckists and Piccinnists, carried on an unworthy and disgraceful war. Gluck&#x27;s masterly &quot;IphigÃ©nie en Tauride&quot; was first produced on 18 May 1779. Piccinni&#x27;s &quot;IphigÃ©nie&quot; followed on 23 January 1781. The antagonism of the rival parties continued, even after Gluck left Paris in 1780; and an attempt was afterwards made to inaugurate a new rivalry with Sacchini. Piccinni remained popular, and on the death of Gluck, in 1787, proposed that a public monument be erected to his memory â a suggestion which the Gluckists refused to support.

In 1784 Piccinni became professor at the Royal School of Music, one of the institutions from which the Conservatoire was formed in 1794. On the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Piccinni returned to Naples, where he was at first well received by King Ferdinand IV; but the marriage of his daughter Claire to a French democrat named Pierre Prades-Prestreau brought him disgrace â he was accused of being a revolutionary and placed under house arrest for four years. For the next nine years he maintained a precarious existence in Venice, Naples and Rome; but he returned in 1798 to Paris, where the public received him with enthusiasm, but he made no money. He died in Passy, near Paris. During his life, he worked with the greatest librettists of his age, including Metastasio. After his death a memorial tablet was set up in the house in which he was born at Bari.

He had married in 1756 his pupil Vincenza Sibilla, a singer, whom he never allowed to appear on the stage after their marriage. A grandson, Louis Alexandre Piccinni, became a successful repetiteur and composer in Paris.

==Works==

The most complete list of his works was given in the &quot;Rivista Musicale Italiana&quot;, VIII. 75.

===Operas===

Piccinni produced over a hundred operas, but although his later work shows the influence of the French and German stage, he belongs to the conventional Italian school of the 18th century.

===Non-operatic works===
Piccinni also wrote a number of sacred works, for voices with various accompanying forces, and also two symphonies (in D major and in G major) and a flute concerto.

<text>Taxodiaceae is a formerly recognized conifer family. It is today recognised as a paraphyletic grade of basal lineages within the Cupressaceae. It contains the following living genera:

*&quot;Athrotaxis&quot;
*&quot;Cryptomeria&quot;
*&quot;Cunninghamia&quot;
*&quot;Glyptostrobus&quot;
*&quot;Metasequoia&quot;
*&quot;Sequoia&quot;
*&quot;Sequoiadendron&quot;
*&quot;Taiwania&quot;
*&quot;Taxodium&quot;

As proposed, genera of the former Taxodiaceae are grouped in the following subfamilies within the larger Cupressaceae:

* Athrotaxidoideae Quinn (&quot;Athrotaxis&quot;)
* Cunninghamioideae (Sieb. &amp; Zucc.) Quinn (&quot;Cunninghamia&quot;)
* Sequoioideae (Luerss.) Quinn (&quot;Sequoia&quot;, &quot;Sequoiadendron,&quot; and &quot;Metasequoia&quot;)
* Taiwanioideae (Hayata) Quinn (&quot;Taiwania&quot;)
* Taxodioideae Endl. ex K. Koch (&quot;Taxodium&quot;, &quot;Glyptostrobus&quot;, and &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;)

==Evolution==

In earth&#x27;s history Taxodiaceae were widespread. They are known since the Jurassic and can be found as fossil from Tertiary times.

<text>The regions of Greece () are the country&#x27;s thirteen second-level administrative entities, counting decentralized administrations of Greece as first-level. Regions are divided into regional units, known as prefectures until 2011.

==History==
The current regions were established in July 1986 (the presidential decree officially establishing them was signed in 1987), by decision of the interior minister, Menios Koutsogiorgas, as second-level administrative entities, complementing the prefectures (Law 1622/1986). Before 1986, there was a traditional division into broad historicalâgeographical regions (Î³ÎµÏÎ³ÏÎ±ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¬ Î´Î¹Î±Î¼ÎµÏÎ¯ÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ±), which, however, was often arbitrary; not all of the pre-1986 traditional historical-geographic regions had official administrative bodies. Although the post-1986 regions were mostly based on the earlier divisions, they are usually smaller and, in a few cases, do not overlap with the traditional definitions: for instance, the region of Western Greece, which had no previous analogue, comprises territory belonging to the Peloponnese peninsula and the traditional region of Central Greece.

As part of a decentralization process inspired by Interior Minister Alekos Papadopoulos, they were accorded more powers in the 1997 Kapodistrias reform of local and regional government. They were transformed into fully separate entities by the 2010 Kallikratis Plan (Law 3852/2010), which entered into effect on 1 January 2011. In the 2011 changes, the government-appointed general secretary (Î³ÎµÎ½Î¹ÎºÏÏ Î³ÏÎ±Î¼Î¼Î±ÏÎ­Î±Ï) was replaced with a popularly elected regional governor (ÏÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÏÎµÎ¹Î¬ÏÏÎ·Ï) and a regional council (ÏÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÏÎµÎ¹Î±ÎºÏ ÏÏÎ¼Î²Î¿ÏÎ»Î¹Î¿) with five-year terms. Many powers of the prefectures, which were also abolished or reformed into regional units, were transferred to the region level. The regional organs of the central government were in turn replaced by seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary.

==List of regions==
Bordering the region of Central Macedonia there is one autonomous region, Mount Athos (&quot;Agion Oros&quot;, or &quot;Holy Mountain&quot;), an autonomous monastic community under Greek sovereignty. It is located on the easternmost of the three large peninsulas jutting into the Aegean from the Chalkidiki peninsula.

<text>During the first administrative division of independent Greece in 1833â1836 and again from 1845 until their abolition with the Kallikratis reform in 2010, the prefectures () were the country&#x27;s main administrative unit. They are now defunct, and have been approximately replaced by regional units.

They are called departments in ISO 3166-2:GR and by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names.

The prefectures were the second-degree organization of local government, grouped into 13 regions or (before 1987) 10 geographical departments, and in turn divided into provinces and comprising a number of communities and municipalities. The prefectures became self-governing entities in 1994, when the first prefectural-level elections took place. The prefects were previously appointed by the government. By 2010, their number had risen to 51, of which one, the Attica Prefecture, where more than a third of the country&#x27;s population resided, was further subdivided into four prefecture-level administrations (Î½Î¿Î¼Î±ÏÏÎ¯ÎµÏ, sing. Î½Î¿Î¼Î±ÏÏÎ¯Î±). In addition, there were three super-prefectures (ÏÏÎµÏÎ½Î¿Î¼Î±ÏÏÎ¯ÎµÏ, sing. ÏÏÎµÏÎ½Î¿Î¼Î±ÏÏÎ¯Î±) controlling two or more prefectures. 

With the Kallikratis reform, which entered into force on 1 January 2011, the prefectures were abolished. Many, especially in the mainland, were retained in the form of &quot;regional units&quot; (ÏÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÏÎµÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ­Ï ÎµÎ½ÏÏÎ·ÏÎµÏ) within the empowered regions, which largely took over the prefectures&#x27; administrative role.

== Organization ==
The &quot;Prefectural Self-Governments&quot; were formed in 1994 and replaced the previous prefectures, whose councils and prefects were appointed by the government.

Prefectures were governed by a Prefectural Council (Î½Î¿Î¼Î±ÏÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÏ ÏÏÎ¼Î²Î¿ÏÎ»Î¹Î¿) made up of 21 to 37 members, led by the Prefect (Î½Î¿Î¼Î¬ÏÏÎ·Ï) and presided by a Council President (ÏÏÏÎµÎ´ÏÎ¿Ï).

Other organs of the prefectures were:
* The Prefectural Committee, consisted of the Prefect or an assistant appointed by him and 4 to 6 members, elected by the Prefectural Council.
* The Provincial Council and
* The Eparchos (Sub-prefect/eparch, Î­ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï).

Super-prefectures had their own organs (Council, Committee and Super-prefect).

Prefectural councillors were elected via public election every four years. Three-fifths of all seats went to the combination winning a majority and two-fifths of the seats going to remaining parties based on a proportional system. Prefect became the president of the victorious electoral combination. Victorious is a combination which attains more than 42% in the first round of the prefectural elections. If no combination passes this threshold, a second round takes place between the two combinations that took the most votes in the first round.

== Duties ==
The State ultimately oversaw the actions of local governments, including the prefectures, but the Constitution of Greece and the Code of Prefectural Self-Government still provided communities and municipalities with legal control over the administration of their designated areas.

The Code of Prefectural Self-Government did not include a non-restrictive list of prefectural duties, but a general rule, according to which the newly formed Prefectural Self-Governments had all the duties of the previous prefectures, which are related to their local affairs. Nonetheless, the affairs of &quot;(central) state administration&quot; belonging to the prefects before 1994 are now exerted by the Presidents of the Regions (ÏÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÏÎµÎ¹Î¬ÏÏÎ·Ï). The Prefectural Self-Governments kept the &quot;local affairs of prefectureal level&quot; not belonging to the &quot;(central) state administration&quot;.

With certain laws specific affairs of certain ministries were transferred to the Prefectural Self-Governments (sanitary committees, urban-planning services etc.).

== List of prefectures ==

==History==
The following prefectures have been part of the Greek state since independence:
Notes:
# Many of the prefectures were originally combined in pairs:
## Attica and Boeotia formed the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture
## Phthiotis Prefecture and Phocis Prefecture formed the Phthiotis and Phocis Prefecture (in 1833â1836 the Phocis and Locris Prefecture)
## Corinthia Prefecture and Argolis Prefecture formed Argolis and Corinthia Prefecture
## Achaea Prefecture and Elis Prefecture formed the Achaea and Elis Prefecture
# Aetolia-Acarnania originally also included Evrytania. Unlike the rest mentioned above, the prefecture never broke up into two prefectures, thus being the only one left with a composite appellation.
# Messenia originally included the southern half of what is now Elis.
# Laconia originally included the southern-eastern half of what is now Messinia.
# Euboea originally included the Sporades, which now belong to Magnesia.
# The territory of Phthiotis Prefecture did not originally include the Domokos Province, which was part of Thessaly (under Ottoman rule until 1881). The area currently constituting the Domokos Province of the Fthiotis Prefecture only became a part of the Greek state in general, and of Phthiotis in particular, after the annexation of Thessaly to Greece in 1881.
# Arcadia Prefecture and the Cyclades Prefecture are the only prefectures to have their borders unchanged since independence.
# The capital of Argolis Prefecture, Nafplion was the first capital of the modern Greek state (1828â1834), before the move of the capital to Athens by King Otto.

There were several short-lived prefectures in areas of present Albania and Turkey, during the Greek occupation of those areas during World War I and the Greco-Turkish War (1919â1922) respectively:

* Argyrokastron (1915â1916), in Northern Epirus (southern Albania)
* Korytsa (1915â1916), in Northern Epirus (southern Albania)
* Adrianople (1920â1922), in Eastern Thrace (European Turkey)
* Kallipolis (1920â1922), in Eastern Thrace (European Turkey)
* Rhaedestos (1920â1922), in Eastern Thrace (European Turkey)
* Saranta Ekklisies (1920â1922), in Eastern Thrace (European Turkey)

<text>Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are not closely related to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 18 species in two genera, with most species placed in the genus &quot;Turnix&quot; and a single species in the genus &quot;Ortyxelos&quot;.

Buttonquails are small, drab, running birds, which avoid flying. The female is the more richly colored of the sexes. While the quail-plover is thought to be monogamous, &quot;Turnix&quot; buttonquails are sequentially polyandrous; both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but normally only the male incubates the eggs and tends the young, while the female may go on to mate with other males.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Turnix&quot; was introduced in 1791 by French naturalist in Pierre Bonnaterre. The genus name is an abbreviation of the genus &quot;Coturnix&quot;. The type species was subsequently designated as the common buttonquail.

The buttonquail family, Turnicidae, was introduced in 1840 by the English zoologist George Robert Gray. The buttonquails were traditionally placed in Gruiformes or Galliformes (the crane and pheasant orders). The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy elevated them to ordinal status as the Turniciformes and basal to other Neoaves either because their accelerated rate of molecular evolution exceeded the limits of sensitivity of DNA-DNA hybridization or because the authors did not perform the appropriate pairwise comparisons or both. Morphological, DNA-DNA hybridization and sequence data indicate that turnicids correctly belong to the shorebirds (Charadriiformes). They seem to be an ancient group among these, as indicated by the buttonquail-like Early Oligocene fossil &quot;Turnipax&quot; and the collected molecular data.

==Description==
The buttonquails are a group of small terrestrial birds. The smallest species is the quail-plover, the only species in the genus &quot;Ortyxelos&quot;, which is in length and weighs only . The buttonquails in the genus &quot;Turnix&quot; range from in length and weigh between . They superficially resemble the true quails of the genus &quot;Coturnix&quot;, but differ from them in lacking a hind toe and a crop. The females of this family also possess a unique vocal organ created by an enlarged trachea and inflatable bulb in the esophagus, which they use to produce a booming call.

==Breeding==
Buttonquails are unusual in that females are serially polyandrous. The nest is a scape on the ground often near overhanging vegetation. The female lays a clutch of 4 or 5 eggs and then looks for a new mate. The male incubates the eggs which hatch synchronously after 12 to 15 days. The precocial chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and are cared for by the male. They can fly at two weeks of age and become independent at four weeks. For the smaller species sexual maturity is reached at three months.

<doc id="221400" wikidata="Q360475" url="?curid=221400" title="Aircraft flight dynamics">
<text>Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle&#x27;s center of gravity (cg), known as &quot;pitch&quot;, &quot;roll&quot; and &quot;yaw&quot;. These are collectively known as aircraft attitude, often principally relative to the atmospheric frame in normal flight, but also relative to terrain during takeoff or landing, or when operating at low elevation. The concept of attitude is not specific to fixed-wing aircraft, but also extends to rotary aircraft such as helicopters, and dirigibles, where the flight dynamics involved in establishing and controlling attitude are entirely different. 

Control systems adjust the orientation of a vehicle about its cg. A control system includes control surfaces which, when deflected, generate a moment (or couple from ailerons) about the cg which rotates the aircraft in pitch, roll, and yaw. For example, a pitching moment comes from a force applied at a distance forward or aft of the cg, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

A fixed-wing aircraft increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the angle of attack (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually &quot;banks&quot; to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is streamlined from nose to tail to reduce drag making it advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though an aircraft may be deliberately &quot;sideslipped&quot; to increase drag and descent rate during landing, to keep aircraft heading same as runway heading during cross-wind landings and during flight with asymmetric power.

== Background ==
Roll, pitch and yaw refer to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined steady flight equilibrium state. The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle.

The most common aeronautical convention defines roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the starboard (right) wing down. Yaw is about the vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.


=== Reference frames ===

Three right-handed, Cartesian coordinate systems see frequent use in flight dynamics. The first coordinate system has an origin fixed in the reference frame of the Earth:
*Earth frame
** Origin - arbitrary, fixed relative to the surface of the Earth
** &quot;xE&quot; axis - positive in the direction of north
** &quot;yE&quot; axis - positive in the direction of east
** &quot;zE&quot; axis - positive towards the center of the Earth
In many flight dynamics applications, the Earth frame is assumed to be inertial with a flat &quot;xE&quot;,&quot;yE&quot;-plane, though the Earth frame can also be considered a spherical coordinate system with origin at the center of the Earth.

The other two reference frames are body-fixed, with origins moving along with the aircraft, typically at the center of gravity. For an aircraft that is symmetric from right-to-left, the frames can be defined as:
*Body frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** &quot;xb&quot; axis - positive out the nose of the aircraft in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft
** &quot;zb&quot; axis - perpendicular to the &quot;xb&quot; axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** &quot;yb&quot; axis - perpendicular to the &quot;xb&quot;,&quot;zb&quot;-plane, positive determined by the right-hand rule (generally, positive out the right wing)
*Wind frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** &quot;xw&quot; axis - positive in the direction of the velocity vector of the aircraft relative to the air
** &quot;zw&quot; axis - perpendicular to the &quot;xw&quot; axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** &quot;yw&quot; axis - perpendicular to the &quot;xw&quot;,&quot;zw&quot;-plane, positive determined by the right hand rule (generally, positive to the right)

Asymmetric aircraft have analogous body-fixed frames, but different conventions must be used to choose the precise directions of the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; axes.

The Earth frame is a convenient frame to express aircraft translational and rotational kinematics. The Earth frame is also useful in that, under certain assumptions, it can be approximated as inertial. Additionally, one force acting on the aircraft, weight, is fixed in the +&quot;zE&quot; direction.

The body frame is often of interest because the origin and the axes remain fixed relative to the aircraft. This means that the relative orientation of the Earth and body frames describes the aircraft attitude. Also, the direction of the force of thrust is generally fixed in the body frame, though some aircraft can vary this direction, for example by thrust vectoring.

The wind frame is a convenient frame to express the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft. In particular, the net aerodynamic force can be divided into components along the wind frame axes, with the drag force in the â&quot;xw&quot; direction and the lift force in the â&quot;zw&quot; direction.
In addition to defining the reference frames, the relative orientation of the reference frames can be determined. The relative orientation can be expressed in a variety of forms, including:
* Rotation matrices
* Direction cosines
* Euler angles
* Quaternions
The various Euler angles relating the three reference frames are important to flight dynamics. Many Euler angle conventions exist, but all of the rotation sequences presented below use the &quot;z-y&#x27;-x&quot;&quot; convention. This convention corresponds to a type of Tait-Bryan angles, which are commonly referred to as Euler angles. This convention is described in detail below for the roll, pitch, and yaw Euler angles that describe the body frame orientation relative to the Earth frame. The other sets of Euler angles are described below by analogy.

=== Transformations (Euler angles) ===

==== From Earth frame to body frame ====

* First, rotate the Earth frame axes &quot;xE&quot; and &quot;yE&quot; around the &quot;zE&quot; axis by the yaw angle &quot;Ï&quot;. This results in an intermediate reference frame with axes denoted &quot;xâ³&quot;,yâ³&quot;,zâ³&quot;, where &quot;z&#x27;=zE&quot;. 
* Second, rotate the &quot;xâ³&quot; and &quot;zâ³&quot; axes around the &quot;yâ³&quot; axis by the pitch angle &quot;Î¸&quot;. This results in another intermediate reference frame with axes denoted &quot;x&quot;,y&quot;,z&quot;&quot;, where &quot;y&quot;=yâ³&quot;. 
* Finally, rotate the &quot;y&quot;&quot; and &quot;z&quot;&quot; axes around the &quot;x&quot;&quot; axis by the roll angle &quot;Ï&quot;. The reference frame that results after the three rotations is the body frame.

Based on the rotations and axes conventions above:

* Yaw angle &quot;Ï:&quot; angle between north and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the horizontal plane;
* Pitch angle &quot;Î¸:&quot; angle between the aircraft longitudinal axis and horizontal;
* Roll angle &quot;Ï:&quot; rotation around the aircraft longitudinal axis after rotating by yaw and pitch.

==== From Earth frame to wind frame ====

* Heading angle &quot;Ï:&quot; angle between north and the horizontal component of the velocity vector, which describes which direction the aircraft is moving relative to cardinal directions.
* Flight path angle &quot;Î³: is the angle between horizontal and the velocity vector, which describes whether the aircraft is climbing or descending.&quot; 
* Bank angle &quot;Î¼: represents a rotation of the lift force around the velocity vector, which may indicate whether the airplane is turning.&quot;

When performing the rotations described above to obtain the body frame from the Earth frame, there is this analogy between angles:

* &quot;Ï, Ï&quot; (heading vs yaw)
* &quot;Î³, Î¸&quot; (Flight path vs pitch)
* &quot;Î¼, Ï&quot; (Bank vs Roll)

==== From wind frame to body frame ====

* sideslip angle &quot;Î²:&quot; angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the xw,yw-plane, which describes whether there is a lateral component to the aircraft velocity

* angle of attack &quot;Î±&quot;: angle between the &quot;xw&quot;,&quot;yw&quot;-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift

When performing the rotations described earlier to obtain the body frame from the Earth frame, there is this analogy between angles:

* &quot;Î², Ï&quot; (sideslip vs yaw)
* &quot;Î±&quot;, &quot;Î¸&quot; (attack vs pitch)
* &quot;(Ï = 0)&quot; (nothing vs roll)

=== Analogies ===
Between the three reference frames there are hence these analogies:

* Yaw / Heading / Sideslip (Z axis, vertical)
* Pitch / Flight path / Attack angle (Y axis, wing)
* Roll / Bank / nothing (X axis, nose)

==Design cases==
In analyzing the stability of an aircraft, it is usual to consider perturbations about a nominal steady flight state. So the analysis would be applied, for example, assuming:
::Straight and level flight
::Turn at constant speed
::Approach and landing
::Takeoff

The speed, height and trim angle of attack are different for each flight condition, in addition, the aircraft will be configured differently, e.g. at low speed flaps may be deployed and the undercarriage may be down.

Except for asymmetric designs (or symmetric designs at significant sideslip), the longitudinal equations of motion (involving pitch and lift forces) may be treated independently of the lateral motion (involving roll and yaw).

The following considers perturbations about a nominal straight and level flight path.

To keep the analysis (relatively) simple, the control surfaces are assumed fixed throughout the motion, this is stick-fixed stability. Stick-free analysis requires the further complication of taking the motion of the control surfaces into account.

Furthermore, the flight is assumed to take place in still air, and the aircraft is treated as a rigid body.

== Forces of flight ==

Three forces act on an aircraft in flight: weight, thrust, and the aerodynamic force.

=== Aerodynamic force ===

==== Components of the aerodynamic force ====

The expression to calculate the aerodynamic force is:

::formula_1

where:
::formula_2 Difference between static pressure and free current pressure
::formula_3 outer normal vector of the element of area
::formula_4 tangential stress vector practised by the air on the body
::formula_5 adequate reference surface

projected on wind axes we obtain:

::formula_6

where:
::formula_7 Drag
::formula_8 Lateral force
::formula_9 Lift

==== Aerodynamic coefficients ====

*Dynamic pressure of the free current formula_10

:Proper reference surface (wing surface, in case of planes) formula_11

*Pressure coefficient formula_12

*Friction coefficient formula_13

*Drag coefficient formula_14

*Lateral force coefficient formula_15

*Lift coefficient formula_16

:It is necessary to know Cp and Cf in every point on the considered surface.

==== Dimensionless parameters and aerodynamic regimes ====

In absence of thermal effects, there are three remarkable dimensionless numbers:

* Compressibility of the flow:
:Mach number formula_17
* Viscosity of the flow:
:Reynolds number formula_18
* Rarefaction of the flow:
:Knudsen number formula_19

where:

::formula_20 speed of sound
:::formula_21 specific heat ratio
:::formula_22 gas constant by mass unity
:::formula_23 absolute temperature
::formula_24 mean free path

According to Î» there are three possible rarefaction grades and their corresponding motions are called:
* Continuum current (negligible rarefaction): formula_25
* Transition current (moderate rarefaction): formula_26
* Free molecular current (high rarefaction): formula_27

The motion of a body through a flow is considered, in flight dynamics, as continuum current. In the outer layer of the space that surrounds the body viscosity will be negligible. However viscosity effects will have to be considered when analysing the flow in the nearness of the boundary layer.

Depending on the compressibility of the flow, different kinds of currents can be considered:
* Incompressible subsonic current: formula_28
* Compressible subsonic current: formula_29
* Transonic current: formula_30
* Supersonic current: formula_31
* Hypersonic current: formula_32

==== Drag coefficient equation and aerodynamic efficiency ====

If the geometry of the body is fixed and in case of symmetric flight (Î²=0 and Q=0), pressure and friction coefficients are functions depending on:
::formula_33
::formula_34
where:
::formula_35 angle of attack
::formula_36 considered point of the surface

Under these conditions, drag and lift coefficient are functions depending exclusively on the angle of attack of the body and Mach and Reynolds numbers. Aerodynamic efficiency, defined as the relation between lift and drag coefficients, will depend on those parameters as well.

::formula_37

It is also possible to get the dependency of the drag coefficient respect to the lift coefficient. This relation is known as the drag coefficient equation:
::formula_38 drag coefficient equation
The aerodynamic efficiency has a maximum value, Emax, respect to CL where the tangent line from the coordinate origin touches the drag coefficient equation plot.

The drag coefficient, CD, can be decomposed in two ways. First typical decomposition separates pressure and friction effects:
::formula_39

There is a second typical decomposition taking into account the definition of the drag coefficient equation. This decomposition separates the effect of the lift coefficient in the equation, obtaining two terms CD0 and CDi. CD0 is known as the parasitic drag coefficient and it is the base drag coefficient at zero lift. CDi is known as the induced drag coefficient and it is produced by the body lift.
::formula_40

==== Parabolic and generic drag coefficient ====

A good attempt for the induced drag coefficient is to assume a parabolic dependency of the lift

:formula_41

Aerodynamic efficiency is now calculated as:

:formula_42

If the configuration of the plane is symmetrical respect to the XY plane, minimum drag coefficient equals to the parasitic drag of the plane.

:formula_43

In case the configuration is asymmetrical respect to the XY plane, however, minimum drag differs from the parasitic drag. On these cases, a new approximate parabolic drag equation can be traced leaving the minimum drag value at zero lift value.

:formula_44

:formula_45

==== Variation of parameters with the Mach number ====
The Coefficient of pressure varies with Mach number by the relation given below:

::formula_46
where
* Cp is the compressible pressure coefficient
* Cp0 is the incompressible pressure coefficient
* &quot;Mâ&quot; is the freestream Mach number.
This relation is reasonably accurate for 0.3 &lt; M &lt; 0.7 and when &quot;M = 1&quot; it becomes â which is impossible physical situation and is called PrandtlâGlauert singularity.

==== Aerodynamic force in a specified atmosphere ====
see Aerodynamic force

==Stability==
Stability is the ability of the aircraft to counteract disturbances to its flight path.

According to David P. Davies, there are six types of aircraft stability: speed stability, stick free static longitudinal stability, static lateral stability, directional stability, oscillatory stability, and spiral stability.

===Speed stability===

An aircraft in cruise flight is typically speed stable. If speed increases, drag increases, which will reduce the speed back to equilibrium for its configuration and thrust setting. If speed decreases, drag decreases, and the aircraft will accelerate back to its equilibrium speed where thrust equals drag.

However, in slow flight, due to lift-induced drag, as speed decreases, drag increases (and vice versa). This is known as the &quot;back of the drag curve&quot;. The aircraft will be speed unstable, because a decrease in speed will cause a further decrease in speed.

=== Static stability and control ===

====Longitudinal static stability====

Longitudinal stability refers to the stability of an aircraft in pitch. For a stable aircraft, if the aircraft pitches up, the wings and tail create a pitch-down moment which tends to restore the aircraft to its original attitude. For an unstable aircraft, a disturbance in pitch will lead to an increasing pitching moment. Longitudinal static stability is the ability of an aircraft to recover from an initial disturbance. Longitudinal dynamic stability refers to the damping of these stabilizing moments, which prevents persistent or increasing oscillations in pitch.

====Directional stability====

Directional or weathercock stability is concerned with the static stability of the airplane about the z axis. Just as in the case of longitudinal stability it is desirable that the aircraft should tend to return to an equilibrium condition when subjected to some form of yawing disturbance. For this the slope of the yawing moment curve must be positive.
An airplane possessing this mode of stability will always point towards the relative wind, hence the name weathercock stability.

=== Dynamic stability and control ===

====Longitudinal modes====
It is common practice to derive a fourth order characteristic equation to describe the longitudinal motion, and then factorize it approximately into a high frequency mode and a low frequency mode. The approach adopted here is using qualitative knowledge of aircraft behavior to simplify the equations from the outset, reaching the result by a more accessible route.

The two longitudinal motions (modes) are called the short period pitch oscillation (SPPO), and the phugoid.

=====Short-period pitch oscillation=====

A short input (in control systems terminology an impulse) in pitch (generally via the elevator in a standard configuration fixed-wing aircraft) will generally lead to overshoots about the trimmed condition. The transition is characterized by a damped simple harmonic motion about the new trim. There is very little change in the trajectory over the time it takes for the oscillation to damp out.

Generally this oscillation is high frequency (hence short period) and is damped over a period of a few seconds. A real-world example would involve a pilot selecting a new climb attitude, for example 5Â° nose up from the original attitude. A short, sharp pull back on the control column may be used, and will generally lead to oscillations about the new trim condition. If the oscillations are poorly damped the aircraft will take a long period of time to settle at the new condition, potentially leading to Pilot-induced oscillation. If the short period mode is unstable it will generally be impossible for the pilot to safely control the aircraft for any period of time.

This damped harmonic motion is called the short period pitch oscillation; it arises from the tendency of a stable aircraft to point in the general direction of flight. It is very similar in nature to the weathercock mode of missile or rocket configurations. The motion involves mainly the pitch attitude formula_47 (theta) and incidence formula_48 (alpha). The direction of the velocity vector, relative to inertial axes is formula_49. The velocity vector is:
::formula_50
::formula_51

where formula_52,formula_53 are the inertial axes components of velocity. According to Newton&#x27;s Second Law, the accelerations are proportional to the forces, so the forces in inertial axes are:

::formula_54
::formula_55

where &quot;m&quot; is the mass.
By the nature of the motion, the speed variation formula_56 is negligible over the period of the oscillation, so:

::formula_57
::formula_58

But the forces are generated by the pressure distribution on the body, and are referred to the velocity vector. But the velocity (wind) axes set is not an inertial frame so we must resolve the fixed axes forces into wind axes. Also, we are only concerned with the force along the z-axis:

::formula_59
Or:
::formula_60

In words, the wind axes force is equal to the centripetal acceleration.

The moment equation is the time derivative of the angular momentum:
::formula_61
where M is the pitching moment, and B is the moment of inertia about the pitch axis.
Let: formula_62, the pitch rate.
The equations of motion, with all forces and moments referred to wind axes are, therefore:
::formula_63
::formula_64
We are only concerned with perturbations in forces and moments, due to perturbations in the states formula_48 and q, and their time derivatives. These are characterized by stability derivatives determined from the flight condition. The possible stability derivatives are:

::formula_66 Lift due to incidence, this is negative because the z-axis is downwards whilst positive incidence causes an upwards force.

::formula_67 Lift due to pitch rate, arises from the increase in tail incidence, hence is also negative, but small compared with formula_66.

::formula_69 Pitching moment due to incidence - the static stability term. Static stability requires this to be negative.

::formula_70 Pitching moment due to pitch rate - the pitch damping term, this is always negative.

Since the tail is operating in the flowfield of the wing, changes in the wing incidence cause changes in the downwash, but there is a delay for the change in wing flowfield to affect the tail lift, this is represented as a moment proportional to the rate of change of incidence:

::formula_71

The delayed downwash effect gives the tail more lift and produces a nose down moment, so formula_71 is expected to be negative.

The equations of motion, with small perturbation forces and moments become:

::formula_73

::formula_74

These may be manipulated to yield as second order linear differential equation in formula_48:

::formula_76

This represents a damped simple harmonic motion.

We should expect formula_77 to be small compared with unity, so the coefficient of formula_48 (the &#x27;stiffness&#x27; term) will be positive, provided formula_79. This expression is dominated by formula_69, which defines the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft, it must be negative for stability. The damping term is reduced by the downwash effect, and it is difficult to design an aircraft with both rapid natural response and heavy damping. Usually, the response is underdamped but stable.

=====Phugoid=====
If the stick is held fixed, the aircraft will not maintain straight and level flight (except in the unlikely case that it happens to be perfectly trimmed for level flight at its current altitude and thrust setting), but will start to dive, level out and climb again. It will repeat this cycle until the pilot intervenes. This long period oscillation in speed and height is called the phugoid mode. This is analyzed by assuming that the SSPO performs its proper function and maintains the angle of attack near its nominal value. The two states which are mainly affected are the flight path angle formula_81 (gamma) and speed. The small perturbation equations of motion are:

::formula_82

which means the centripetal force is equal to the perturbation in lift force.

For the speed, resolving along the trajectory:

::formula_83

where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface. The acceleration along the trajectory is equal to the net x-wise force minus the component of weight. We should not expect significant aerodynamic derivatives to depend on the flight path angle, so only formula_84 and formula_85 need be considered. formula_84 is the drag increment with increased speed, it is negative, likewise formula_85 is the lift increment due to speed increment, it is also negative because lift acts in the opposite sense to the z-axis.

The equations of motion become:
::formula_88
::formula_89

These may be expressed as a second order equation in flight path angle or speed perturbation:
::formula_90
Now lift is very nearly equal to weight:
::formula_91
where formula_92 is the air density, formula_93 is the wing area, W the weight and formula_94 is the lift coefficient (assumed constant because the incidence is constant), we have, approximately:

::formula_95

The period of the phugoid, T, is obtained from the coefficient of u:

::formula_96
Or:
::formula_97

Since the lift is very much greater than the drag, the phugoid is at best lightly damped. A propeller with fixed speed would help. Heavy damping of the pitch rotation or a large rotational inertia increase the coupling between short period and phugoid modes, so that these will modify the phugoid.

====Lateral modes====

With a symmetrical rocket or missile, the directional stability in yaw is the same as the pitch stability; it resembles the short period pitch oscillation, with yaw plane equivalents to the pitch plane stability derivatives. For this reason, pitch and yaw directional stability are collectively known as the &quot;weathercock&quot; stability of the missile.

Aircraft lack the symmetry between pitch and yaw, so that directional stability in yaw is derived from a different set of stability derivatives. The yaw plane equivalent to the short period pitch oscillation, which describes yaw plane directional stability is called Dutch roll. Unlike pitch plane motions, the lateral modes involve both roll and yaw motion.

=====Dutch roll=====

It is customary to derive the equations of motion by formal manipulation in what, to the engineer, amounts to a piece of mathematical sleight of hand. The current approach follows the pitch plane analysis in formulating the equations in terms of concepts which are reasonably familiar.

Applying an impulse via the rudder pedals should induce Dutch roll, which is the oscillation in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging yaw by a quarter cycle, so that the wing tips follow elliptical paths with respect to the aircraft.

The yaw plane translational equation, as in the pitch plane, equates the centripetal acceleration to the side force.

::formula_98

where formula_99 (beta) is the sideslip angle, Y the side force and r the yaw rate.

The moment equations are a bit trickier. The trim condition is with the aircraft at an angle of attack with respect to the airflow. The body x-axis does not align with the velocity vector, which is the reference direction for wind axes. In other words, wind axes are not principal axes (the mass is not distributed symmetrically about the yaw and roll axes). Consider the motion of an element of mass in position -z, x in the direction of the y-axis, i.e. into the plane of the paper.
If the roll rate is p, the velocity of the particle is:

:::formula_100

Made up of two terms, the force on this particle is first the proportional to rate of v change, the second is due to the change in direction of this component of velocity as the body moves. The latter terms gives rise to cross products of small quantities (pq, pr, qr), which are later discarded. In this analysis, they are discarded from the outset for the sake of clarity. In effect, we assume that the direction of the velocity of the particle due to the simultaneous roll and yaw rates does not change significantly throughout the motion. With this simplifying assumption, the acceleration of the particle becomes:

:::formula_101

The yawing moment is given by:

:::formula_102

There is an additional yawing moment due to the offset of the particle in the y direction:formula_103

The yawing moment is found by summing over all particles of the body:

:::formula_104

where N is the yawing moment, E is a product of inertia, and C is the moment of inertia about the yaw axis.
A similar reasoning yields the roll equation:

:::formula_105

where L is the rolling moment and A the roll moment of inertia.

===== Lateral and longitudinal stability derivatives =====
The states are formula_99 (sideslip), r (yaw rate) and p (roll rate), with moments N (yaw) and L (roll), and force Y (sideways). There are nine stability derivatives relevant to this motion, the following explains how they originate. However a better intuitive understanding is to be gained by simply playing with a model airplane, and considering how the forces on each component are affected by changes in sideslip and angular velocity:
:::formula_107 Side force due to side slip (in absence of yaw).

Sideslip generates a sideforce from the fin and the fuselage. In addition, if the wing has dihedral, side slip at a positive roll angle increases incidence on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port side, resulting in a net force component directly opposite to the sideslip direction. Sweep back of the wings has the same effect on incidence, but since the wings are not inclined in the vertical plane, backsweep alone does not affect formula_107. However, anhedral may be used with high backsweep angles in high performance aircraft to offset the wing incidence effects of sideslip. Oddly enough this does not reverse the sign of the wing configuration&#x27;s contribution to formula_107 (compared to the dihedral case).

:::formula_110 Side force due to roll rate.

Roll rate causes incidence at the fin, which generates a corresponding side force. Also, positive roll (starboard wing down) increases the lift on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port. If the wing has dihedral, this will result in a side force momentarily opposing the resultant sideslip tendency. Anhedral wing and or stabilizer configurations can cause the sign of the side force to invert if the fin effect is swamped.

:::formula_111 Side force due to yaw rate.

Yawing generates side forces due to incidence at the rudder, fin and fuselage.

:::formula_112 Yawing moment due to sideslip forces.

Sideslip in the absence of rudder input causes incidence on the fuselage and empennage, thus creating a yawing moment counteracted only by the directional stiffness which would tend to point the aircraft&#x27;s nose back into the wind in horizontal flight conditions. Under sideslip conditions at a given roll angle formula_112 will tend to point the nose into the sideslip direction even without rudder input, causing a downward spiraling flight.

:::formula_114 Yawing moment due to roll rate.

Roll rate generates fin lift causing a yawing moment and also differentially alters the lift on the wings, thus affecting the induced drag contribution of each wing, causing a (small) yawing moment contribution. Positive roll generally causes positive formula_114 values unless the empennage is anhedral or fin is below the roll axis. Lateral force components resulting from dihedral or anhedral wing lift differences has little effect on formula_114 because the wing axis is normally closely aligned with the center of gravity.

:::formula_117 Yawing moment due to yaw rate.

Yaw rate input at any roll angle generates rudder, fin and fuselage force vectors which dominate the resultant yawing moment. Yawing also increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst slowing down the inboard wing, with corresponding changes in drag causing a (small) opposing yaw moment. formula_117 opposes the inherent directional stiffness which tends to point the aircraft&#x27;s nose back into the wind and always matches the sign of the yaw rate input.

:::formula_119 Rolling moment due to sideslip.

A positive sideslip angle generates empennage incidence which can cause positive or negative roll moment depending on its configuration. For any non-zero sideslip angle dihedral wings causes a rolling moment which tends to return the aircraft to the horizontal, as does back swept wings. With highly swept wings the resultant rolling moment may be excessive for all stability requirements and anhedral could be used to offset the effect of wing sweep induced rolling moment.
:::formula_120 Rolling moment due to yaw rate.

Yaw increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst reducing speed of the inboard one, causing a rolling moment to the inboard side. The contribution of the fin normally supports this inward rolling effect unless offset by anhedral stabilizer above the roll axis (or dihedral below the roll axis).

:::formula_121 Rolling moment due to roll rate.

Roll creates counter rotational forces on both starboard and port wings whilst also generating such forces at the empennage. These opposing rolling moment effects have to be overcome by the aileron input in order to sustain the roll rate. If the roll is stopped at a non-zero roll angle the formula_119 &quot;upward&quot; rolling moment induced by the ensuing sideslip should return the aircraft to the horizontal unless exceeded in turn by the &quot;downward&quot; formula_120 rolling moment resulting from sideslip induced yaw rate. Longitudinal stability could be ensured or improved by minimizing the latter effect.

=====Equations of motion=====
Since Dutch roll is a handling mode, analogous to the short period pitch oscillation, any effect it might have on the trajectory may be ignored. The body rate &quot;r&quot; is made up of the rate of change of sideslip angle and the rate of turn. Taking the latter as zero, assuming no effect on the trajectory, for the limited purpose of studying the Dutch roll:

:::formula_124

The yaw and roll equations, with the stability derivatives become:

::formula_125 (yaw)

::formula_126 (roll)

The inertial moment due to the roll acceleration is considered small compared with the aerodynamic terms, so the equations become:

::formula_127
::formula_128

This becomes a second order equation governing either roll rate or sideslip:

::formula_129

The equation for roll rate is identical. But the roll angle, &quot;formula_130&quot; (phi) is given by:

:::formula_131

If &quot;p&quot; is a damped simple harmonic motion, so is &quot;formula_130&quot;, but the roll must be in quadrature with the roll rate, and hence also with the sideslip. The motion consists of oscillations in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging 90 degrees behind the yaw. The wing tips trace out elliptical paths.

Stability requires the &quot;stiffness&quot; and &quot;damping&quot; terms to be positive. These are:

:::formula_133 (damping)

:::formula_134 (stiffness)

The denominator is dominated by formula_121, the roll damping derivative, which is always negative, so the denominators of these two expressions will be positive.

Considering the &quot;stiffness&quot; term: formula_136 will be positive because formula_121 is always negative and formula_112 is positive by design. formula_119 is usually negative, whilst formula_114 is positive. Excessive dihedral can destabilize the Dutch roll, so configurations with highly swept wings require anhedral to offset the wing sweep contribution to formula_119.

The damping term is dominated by the product of the roll damping and the yaw damping derivatives, these are both negative, so their product is positive. The Dutch roll should therefore be damped.

The motion is accompanied by slight lateral motion of the center of gravity and a more &quot;exact&quot; analysis will introduce terms in formula_107 etc. In view of the accuracy with which stability derivatives can be calculated, this is an unnecessary pedantry, which serves to obscure the relationship between aircraft geometry and handling, which is the fundamental objective of this article.

=====Roll subsidence=====
Jerking the stick sideways and returning it to center causes a net change in roll orientation.

The roll motion is characterized by an absence of natural stability, there are no stability derivatives which generate moments in response to the inertial roll angle. A roll disturbance induces a roll rate which is only canceled by pilot or autopilot intervention. This takes place with insignificant changes in sideslip or yaw rate, so the equation of motion reduces to:

::formula_143

formula_121 is negative, so the roll rate will decay with time. The roll rate reduces to zero, but there is no direct control over the roll angle.

=====Spiral mode=====
Simply holding the stick still, when starting with the wings near level, an aircraft will usually have a tendency to gradually veer off to one side of the straight flightpath. This is the (slightly unstable) spiral mode.

======Spiral mode trajectory======
In studying the trajectory, it is the direction of the velocity vector, rather than that of the body, which is of interest. The direction of the velocity vector when projected on to the horizontal will be called the track, denoted &quot;formula_145&quot; (mu). The body orientation is called the heading, denoted &quot;formula_146&quot; (psi). The force equation of motion includes a component of weight:

::formula_147

where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, and &quot;U&quot; is the speed.

Including the stability derivatives:

::formula_148

Roll rates and yaw rates are expected to be small, so the contributions of formula_111 and formula_110 will be ignored.

The sideslip and roll rate vary gradually, so their time derivatives are ignored. The yaw and roll equations reduce to:

::formula_151 (yaw)

::formula_152 (roll)

Solving for &quot;formula_99&quot; and &quot;p&quot;:

:::formula_154

:::formula_155

Substituting for sideslip and roll rate in the force equation results in a first order equation in roll angle:

:::formula_156

This is an exponential growth or decay, depending on whether the coefficient of &quot;formula_130&quot; is positive or negative. The denominator is usually negative, which requires formula_158 (both products are positive). This is in direct conflict with the Dutch roll stability requirement, and it is difficult to design an aircraft for which both the Dutch roll and spiral mode are inherently stable.

Since the spiral mode has a long time constant, the pilot can intervene to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable Dutch roll would be difficult to fly. It is usual to design the aircraft with a stable Dutch roll mode, but slightly unstable spiral mode.

<text>Pierre-Louis GinguenÃ© (25 April 1748 â 16 November 1816) was a French author.

==Biography==
He was born at Rennes, in Brittany, and educated at a Jesuit college there. He came to Paris in 1772, and wrote criticisms for the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. He also composed a comic opera, &quot;Pomponin&quot; (1777). The &quot;Satire des satires&quot; (1778) and the &quot;Confession de ZulmÃ©&quot; (1779) followed. The &quot;Confession&quot; was claimed by several different authors and was very successful.

GinguenÃ©&#x27;s defence of Niccola Piccinni against the partisans of Gluck made him more widely known. He hailed the first symptoms of the French Revolution, and joined Giuseppe Cerutti, the author of the &quot;MÃ©moire pour le peuple franÃ§ais&quot; (1788), and others in producing the &quot;Feuille villageoise&quot;, a weekly paper addressed to the villages of France. He also celebrated in an indifferent ode the opening of the states-general. In his &quot;Lettres sur les confessions de J.-J. Rousseau&quot; (1791), he defended the life and principles of his author.

He was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror and escaped with life only by the downfall of Maximilien Robespierre. After his release he assisted, as director-general of the &quot;commission exÃ©cutive de l&#x27;instruction publique&quot;, in reorganizing the system of public instruction, and he was an original member of the Institute of France. In 1797, the Directory appointed him minister plenipotentiary to the king of Sardinia. After seven months, GinguenÃ© retired to his country house of St Prix, in the valley of Montmorency. He was appointed a member of the tribunate, but Napoleon, finding that he was not sufficiently tractable, had him expelled at the first &quot;purge&quot;, and GinguenÃ© returned to his literary pursuits.

== Career ==
He was one of the commission appointed to continue the &quot;Histoire littÃ©raire de la France&quot;, and he contributed to the volumes of this series which appeared in 1814, 1817 and 1820. GinguenÃ©&#x27;s most important work is the &quot;Histoire littÃ©raire d&#x27;Italie&quot; (14 vols., 1811â1835). He was putting the finishing touches to the eighth and ninth volumes when he died. The last five volumes were written by Francesco Salfi and revised by Pierre Daunou.

In the composition of his history of Italian literature he was guided for the most part by the great work of Girolamo Tiraboschi, but he avoids the prejudices and party views of his model.

GinguenÃ© edited the &quot;DÃ©cade philosophique, politique et littÃ©raire&quot; until it was suppressed by Napoleon in 1807. He contributed largely to the &quot;Biographie universelle&quot;, the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; and the &quot;Encyclopidie mÃ©thodique&quot;; and he edited the works of Nicolas Chamfort and of Lebrun. Among his minor productions are an opera, &quot;Pomponin on le tuteur mystifiÃ©&quot; (1777); &quot;La Satire des satires&quot; (1778); &quot;De l&#x27;autoritÃ© de Rabelais dans la revolution prÃ©sente&quot; (1791); &quot;De M. Neckar&quot; (1795); &quot;Fables nouvelles&quot; (1810); &quot;Fables inÃ©dites&quot; (1814).

==Legacy==
GinguenÃ© is buried in the PÃ¨re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

The Rue GinguenÃ© in Rennes is named after him.

<text>Taxodium is a genus of one to three species (depending on taxonomic opinion) of extremely flood-tolerant conifers in the cypress family, Cupressaceae. The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;taxus&quot;, meaning &quot;yew&quot;, and the Greek word &quot;Îµá¼¶Î´Î¿Ï&quot; (&quot;eidos&quot;), meaning &quot;similar to.&quot; Within the family, &quot;Taxodium&quot; is most closely related to Chinese swamp cypress (&quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot;) and sugi (&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;).

Species of &quot;Taxodium&quot; occur in the southern part of the North American continent and are deciduous in the north and semi-evergreen to evergreen in the south. They are large trees, reaching tall and (exceptionally ) trunk diameter. The needle-like leaves, long, are borne spirally on the shoots, twisted at the base so as to appear in two flat rows on either side of the shoot. The cones are globose, diameter, with 10â25 scales, each scale with one or two seeds; they are mature in 7â9 months after pollination, when they disintegrate to release the seeds. The male (pollen) cones are produced in pendulous racemes, and shed their pollen in early spring. &quot;Taxodium&quot; species grow cypress knees, when growing in or beside water. The function of these knees is currently a subject of ongoing research.

== Species ==
The three extant taxa of &quot;Taxodium&quot; are treated here as distinct species, though some botanists treat them in just one or two species, with the others considered as varieties of the first described. The three are distinct in ecology, growing in different environments, but hybridise where they meet.
*â &quot;Taxodium dubium&quot; 

===Formerly placed here===
* &quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot; (as &quot;T. japonicum&quot; var. &quot;heterophyllum&quot; )
* &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; (as &quot;T. sempervirens&quot; )

== Uses ==

The trees are especially prized for their wood, of which the heartwood is extremely rot- and termite-resistant. The heartwood contains a sesquiterpene called cypressene, which acts as a natural preservative. It takes decades for cypressene to accumulate in the wood, so lumber taken from old-growth trees is more rot resistant than that from second-growth trees. However, age also increases susceptibility to Pecky Rot fungus (&quot;Stereum taxodii&quot;), which attacks the heartwood and causes some damaged trees to become hollow and thus useless for timber. Bald Cypress wood was much used in former days in the southeastern United States for roof shingles. The shredded bark of these trees is used as a mulch.

== Evolution ==

In earth&#x27;s history &quot;Taxodium&quot; was much more widespread in the Northern Hemisphere than today. The oldest fossils were found in Late Cretaceous deposits from North America. The trees persisted in Europe until around 2.5 million years ago, during the Pliocene.

<text>Girolamo Tiraboschi (; 18 December 1731 â 9 June 1794) was an Italian literary critic, the first historian of Italian literature.

==Biography==
Born in Bergamo, he studied at the Jesuit college in Monza, entered the order, and was appointed in 1755 professor of eloquence in the University of Milan. There he produced (1766â1768) &quot;Vetera humiliatorum monumenta&quot; (3 vols), a history of the extinct order of the Humiliati, which made his literary reputation.

Nominated in 1770 as librarian to Francis III, duke of Modena, he turned to account the copious materials there accumulated for the composition of his &quot;Storia della letteratura italiana&quot;. This vast work, in which Italian literature from the time of the Etruscans to the end of the 17th century is traced in detail, occupied eleven years, 1771â1782, and the thirteen quarto volumes embodying it appeared successively in Modena during that period.

A second enlarged edition (16 vols) was issued from 1787 to 1794, and was succeeded by many others, besides abridgments in German, French and English. Tiraboschi died in Modena on 3 June 1794, leaving a high reputation for virtue, learning and piety.

Tiraboschi also wrote, among many other works:
*&quot;Biblioteca modenese&quot; (6 vols, 1781â1786) 
*&quot;Memorie storiche modenesi&quot; (5 vols, 1793â1794)
He edited the &quot;Nuovo giornale dei letterati d&#x27;Italia&quot; (1773â1790), and left materials for a work of great research entitled &quot;Dizionario topografico-storico degli stati estensi&quot; (2 vols, 1824â1825),

<text>In art a predella (plural predelle) is the lowest part of an altarpiece, sometimes forming a platform or step, and the painting or sculpture along it, at the bottom of an altarpiece, sometimes with a single much larger main scene above, but often (especially in earlier examples), a polyptych or multipanel altarpiece. In late medieval and Renaissance altarpieces, where the main panel consisted of a scene with large figures, it was normal to include a predella below with a number of small-scale narrative paintings depicting events from the life of the dedicatee, whether the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; or a saint. Typically there would be three to five small scenes, in a horizontal format. Sometimes a single space shows different scenes in continuous representation.
They are significant in art history, as the artist had more freedom from iconographic conventions than in the main panel as they could only be seen from close up. As the main panels themselves became larger and more dramatic, predellas fell from use around 1510-20 in the High Renaissance, although older or more conservative painters continued to use them, for example Luca Signorelli, by then in his 70s, in about 1521. In this case he is thought to have only done the underdrawing for the main scene, leaving the painting to his workshop assistants. But he is thought to have painted the predella scenes himself. 

They had fallen out of fashion in Italy by the mid 16th century, but continued for a while further north. As altarpieces reached the art market from the 18th century onwards, the predella scenes (and other smaller sections) were often detached and sold separately, in effect as cabinet paintings, and they are now often spread across several museum collections, with their origin often uncertain. Reuniting, at least conceptually, predella panels with the rest of their original settings gave 20th-century art historians a large task, which continues into the 21st century. 

More generally, and not usually in the English language, a predella is an altar-step, a shelf above and behind an altar, or a piece of furniture with a lower part to kneel on, for prayer, and often a higher part to support the arms. In English the French term prie-dieu is normally used for this. &quot;Predel&quot; or &quot;pretel&quot;, was Langobardic for &quot;a low wooden platform that serves as a basis in a piece of furniture&quot;. In English this step is referred to as a gradin, which may include a pradella in it.

Similar small reliefs are sometimes placed under a larger piece of sculpture. Donatello placed a narrow scene of &quot;Saint George Freeing the Princess&quot; on the base of his &quot;Saint George&quot; for Orsanmichele.

==Examples==
Examples of predellas include:
* Duccio â the predella of his &quot;MaestÃ &quot; â one of the earliest predellas.
* Lorenzo Monaco â &quot;Incidents in the Life of Saint Benedict&quot; ()
* Luca Signorelli â &quot;The Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; ()
* Andrea Mantegna â &quot;San Zeno Altarpiece&quot; (1459)
* Stanley Spencer â Sandham Memorial Chapel, Burghclere, Hants.
* Pre-Raphaelite Dante Rossetti revisited the predella in his second Beata Beatrix (1871-1872).
* Leigh Behnke â a 20th-century realist, she has made use of the predella format in numerous works (c. 1981â2019)
