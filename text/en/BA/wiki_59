<text>The Joker is a playing card found in most modern French-suited card decks, as an addition to the standard four suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades). Since the second half of the 20th century, they have also been found in Spanish- and Italian-suited decks, excluding stripped decks.

The Joker originated in the United States during the Civil War, and was created as a trump card for the game of Euchre. It has since been adopted into many other card games, where it often acts as a wild card, but may have other functions such as the top trump, a skip card (forcing another player to miss a turn), the lowest-ranking card, the highest-value card, or a card of a different value from the rest of the pack (see e.g. Zwicker which has six Jokers with this function).

By contrast, a wild card is any card that may be used to represent another card or cardsit does not need be a Joker.

==Origin==
The game of Euchre is credited with the introduction of the Joker into card games. However, Euchre originally did not use Jokers. In the earliest rules of 1844, 32 standard cards are used and the &quot;Right Bower&quot;, the trump Jack, was the &quot;commanding card&quot; with the &quot;Left Bower&quot;, the Jack of the same colour, as the second-highest card. According to card game historian, David Parlett, the Joker was added to a 32card pack in the 1850s specifically for the game of Euchre and is first mentioned in a set of rules in 1868 where the blank specimen card is adapted for use in play. This gave rise to a variant game called &quot;Euchre with the Joker&quot; in which the blank card ranked above all the rest. While the term &quot;best bower&quot; appears in a satirical 1861 piece about the American Civil War, this may only refer to the Right Bower and not a special card produced for that purpose. Samuel Hart is credited with printing the first illustrated &quot;Best Bower&quot; card in 1863 with his &quot;Imperial Bower&quot;. Best Bower-type Jokers continued to be produced well into the 20th century. Cards labelled &quot;Joker&quot; began appearing around the late 1860s, with some depicting clowns and jesters such as Elizabethan jester Richard Tarlton.

The idea behind the three top cards in Euchre appears to have originated from Germany where the games Juckerspiel and Bester Bube (&quot;Best Bower&quot;) also used Jacks as best, right and left bowers. It is also believed that the term &quot;Joker&quot; comes from &quot;Juckerspiel&quot;, which is also known as &quot;Jucker&quot;, the original German spelling of Euchre. One British manufacturer, Charles Goodall, was manufacturing packs with Jokers for the American market in 1871. The first Joker for the domestic British market was sold in 1874. Italians call Jokers &quot;Jolly&quot;, for many early cards were labelled &quot;Jolly Joker&quot;.

The notion of a Joker was later transferred to the game of Poker where it was initially called the Mistigris. This happened around 1875, where it functioned as a wild card. Packs with two Jokers started to become the norm during the late 1940s for the game of Canasta. Since the 1950s, German and Austrian packs have included three Jokers to play German Rummy. In Poland, the third Joker is known as the blue Joker because the KZWP monopoly during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic printed all third Jokers blue. In Schleswig-Holstein, Zwicker packs come with six Jokers.

==Appearance==
Jokers do not have any standardized appearance across the card manufacturing industry. Each company produces their own depictions of the card. The publishers of playing cards trademark their Jokers, which have unique artwork that often reflect contemporary culture. Out of convention, Jokers tend to be illustrated as jesters. There are usually two Jokers per deck, often noticeably different. For instance, the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC) prints one as monochrome and the other in colour. At times, the Jokers will each be colored to match the colors used for suits; e.g., there will be a red Joker and a black Joker. In games where the Jokers may need to be compared, the red, full-color, or larger-graphic Joker usually outranks the black, monochrome, or smaller-graphic one. If the Joker colors are similar, the Joker without a guarantee will outrank the guaranteed one. With the red and black Jokers, the red one can alternately be counted as a Heart/Diamond and the black one can alternately be counted as a Club/Spade. The Unicode for playing cards provide symbols for three Jokers: red, black, and white.

Many decks do not provide the Joker with a corner index symbol; of those that do, the most common is a solid star (as is the case with Bee cards). It is also common for decks to simply display the word &quot;JOKER&quot; in the corner. Bicycle cards use a &quot;US&quot; monogram as the Joker index.

==Collecting==
Joker collecting has been popular for an unknown amount of time, but with the advent of the Internet and social media, it has emerged as a hobby. Many unusual Jokers are available for purchase online, while other collectible Jokers are catalogued online for viewing. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; has recognized Denoto de Santis, an Italian magician, as having the world&#x27;s largest collection of Jokers.

==Tarot and Tarock card games==
The Joker is often compared to &quot;(the) Fool&quot; in the Tarot or Tarock decks. They share many similarities both in appearance and in play function. In central Europe, the Fool, or &quot;Sküs&quot;, is the highest trump; elsewhere as an &quot;excuse&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Excuse&quot;) that can be played at any time to avoid following suit, but cannot win.

==Use of the Joker in card games==
In a standard deck in the US or Britain, there are usually two Jokers. In other countries, such as Germany, there are usually three Jokers in a pack. The Joker&#x27;s use varies greatly. Many card games omit the cards entirely; as a result, Jokers are sometimes used as informal replacements for lost or damaged cards in a deck by simply noting the lost card&#x27;s rank and suit on the Joker. Other games, such as a 25card variant of Euchre which uses the Joker as the highest trump, make it one of the most important in the game. Often, the Joker is a wild card, which allows it to represent other existing cards. The term &quot;Joker&#x27;s wild&quot; originates from this practice. However, in Zwicker Jokers are higher value, matching and scoring cards while, in one variant, a normal suit card is the only one that is wild.

The Joker can be an extremely good or extremely bad card to have, depending on the game you are playing. In Euchre it is often used to represent the highest trump. In Gin Rummy it is wild. However, in the children&#x27;s game of Old Maid, a solitary Joker represents the Old Maid, the card to be avoided.

===Role in multi-player games===
*Euchre, 500: As the highest trump or &quot;top Bower&quot;.
*Canasta: Uses two or three Jokers per deck. The Joker, like the deuce, is a wild card. However, the Joker is worth fifty points in melding, as opposed to twenty for the deuce.
*Gin Rummy: a wild card, able to be used as any necessary rank or suit to complete a meld. 
*Chase the Joker: An alternative version of Old Maid, where the Joker card is used instead of the Ace.
*Poker: A Joker can be wild, or can be a &quot;bug&quot;, a limited form of wild card which can be used only to complete straights and flushes.
*War: In some variations, beats all other cards.
*Pitch: A point card in some variations. Jokers usually are marked as &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, one outranking the other.
*Daifugō: a wild card, or a deuce (which ends the round and clears the discard pile).
*Crazy Eights: a &quot;skip&quot; card, playable on top of any other card, that forces the next player to lose a turn.
*Spades: uncommon, but can fulfil one of two roles. When playing with three or six players, they are added to make the cards deal evenly (eighteen or nine cards each, respectively). They are either &quot;junk&quot; cards playable any time that cannot win a trick, or they count as the two highest trumps (the two Jokers must be differentiable; the &quot;big Joker&quot; outranks the &quot;little Joker&quot;). They also can be used in conjunction with teammates&#x27; cards to create a &quot;pseudo-trump&quot;, e.g. an Ace of Hearts and a Joker played together could be counted as an Ace of Spades, inferior only to a natural Ace of Spades.
*Double Pedro: As the lowest-ranked card, but worth 18 points.
*Go Fish: In the pair-forming variant played between two players, the Joker pair is often used to bring the number of pairs to 27 and prevent a 13–13 tie.
*Dou dizhu: Jokers are used as the highest value cards; one is little and one is big, usually the colored one being bigger. Both Jokers together is the only unbeatable play.

===Role in patience (solitaire) games===
Generally, the Joker is omitted from patience games as in many others of its type. However, there are variations of solitaire games where a Joker does take part, most often as a wild card.
*Forty Thieves: the Joker is placed on the foundations, while the natural card is unavailable. Any applicable cards are placed over the Joker. When the natural card becomes available, it replaces the Joker, which in turn is placed on the top of the foundation pile. When the Joker is placed on an empty foundation, it stays there until an Ace appears.
*FreeCell: the Joker functions the same way as mentioned above, but when the natural card it replaces becomes available and the Joker is placed on top, the Joker can be placed on another foundation.
*Golf: where Kings can be built, the Joker, whenever available, is placed on the wastepile as a wild card and any card can be placed over it.
*Klondike: the Joker acts the same way as it is in Forty Thieves. It can also be built while it is still on the tableau. The United States Playing Card Company&#x27;s version, created by Joli Quentin Kansil, uses two Jokers, with the black Joker to be used as a wild black card and the red Joker as a wild red card.
*Pyramid: the Joker is discarded together with any available card. In this case, the stock is dealt one card at time and can be reused twice.
*Aces Up: The Jokers are used to clear out a row and are sometimes referred to as &quot;Joker bombs&quot;. When a Joker is dealt into a column, the entire column is reshuffled into the stock and that particular Joker is removed from the game. This leaves an empty foundation slot and greatly increases the win rate.

<text>Black-and-white (B&amp;W or B/W) images combine black and white to produce a range of achromatic brightnesses of grey. It is also known as greyscale in technical settings.

== Media ==
The history of various visual media began with black and white, and as technology improved, altered to color. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including black-and-white fine art photography, as well as many film motion pictures and art film(s).

Early photographs in the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries were often developed in black and white, as an alternative to sepia due to limitations in film available at the time. Black and white was also prevalent in early television broadcasts, which were displayed by changing the intensity of monochrome phosphurs on the inside of the screen, before the introduction of colour from the 1950s onwards. 

Black and white continues to be used in certain sections of the modern arts field, either stylistically or to invoke the perception of a historic work or setting.

===Photography===


== Contemporary use ==
Since the late 1960s, few mainstream films have been shot in black-and-white. The reasons are frequently commercial, as it is difficult to sell a film for television broadcasting if the film is not in color. 1961 was the last year in which the majority of Hollywood films were released in black and white.

== Computing ==
In computing terminology, &quot;black-and-white&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a binary image consisting solely of pure black pixels and pure white ones; what would normally be called a black-and-white image, that is, an image containing shades of gray, is referred to in this context as grayscale.

<text>Privatdozent (for men) or Privatdozentin (for women), abbreviated PD, P.D. or Priv.-Doz., is an academic title conferred at some European universities, especially in German-speaking countries, to someone who holds certain formal qualifications that denote an ability (&quot;facultas docendi&quot;) and permission to teach (&quot;venia legendi&quot;) a designated subject at the highest level. To be granted the title Priv.-Doz. by a university, a recipient has to fulfill the criteria set by the university which usually require excellence in research, teaching, and further education. In its current usage, the title indicates that the holder has completed their habilitation and is therefore granted permission to teach and examine students independently without having a full professorship (chair). With respect to the level of academic achievement, the title of &quot;Privatdozent&quot; is comparable to that of Associate Professor (North America), Senior Lecturer (United Kingdom), or &quot;maître de conférences détenteur de l&#x27;habilitation à diriger des recherches (HDR)&quot; (France). However, unlike the Associate Professors in North America, PD titles are not always linked to tenured academic positions and do not always imply the role of a Principal Investigator.

==Conferment and roles==
A university faculty can confer the title to an academic who has a higher doctoral degree—usually in the form of a habilitation. The title, &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, as such does not imply a salaried appointment; it merely denotes permission to teach and examine independently at the conferring faculty without a professorial appointment. At German universities, some title holders are appointed as Senior Researchers or &quot;Dozent&quot; (either on a fee basis or as tenured academic employees), while others are solely supported by externally funded research projects.

Even though many title holders are not employed by the university and do not have remuneration agreements with their conferring institution, depending on local regulations, they may be required to teach in order to maintain their status as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. In 2012 more than 5,000 honorarium &quot;Privatdozenten&quot; worked at German universities without a salary.
A &quot;Privatdozent&quot; ceases to hold the title if appointed at professorial level or if discontinuing lecturing at the faculty. In Germany, the title can be revoked if the holder does not lecture for more than two consecutive semesters.

==History and future==
The title has its origins in German-speaking countries in Europe before 1800. It referred to a lecturer who received fees from his students rather than a university salary.

In Prussia it started around 1810, and became established around 1860. From 1900 until 1968, most university professors who were appointed were title holders, as they obtained a habilitation and already held a teaching position.

Since the end of the 1960s, the requirement of a post-doctoral degree for a professorship in Germany has been questioned and in some cases is not necessary. In 2002, junior professorships were introduced, providing a route to a professorship without habilitation; the habilitation is no longer the gold standard against which other qualifications are measured during the appointment process. This has led to a decline in universities conferring the title &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in certain academic disciplines.

<text>The royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, also referred to as the royal arms, are the arms of dominion of the British monarch, currently Charles III. They are used by the Government of the United Kingdom and by other Crown institutions, including courts in the United Kingdom and in some parts of the Commonwealth. Differenced versions of the arms are used by members of the British royal family. The monarch&#x27;s official flag, the Royal Standard, is the coat of arms in flag form.

There are two versions of the coat of arms. One is used in Scotland, and includes elements derived from the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Scotland, and the other is used elsewhere and includes elements derived from the coat of arms of the Kingdom of England. The shields of both versions of the arms quarter the arms of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, which united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and the Kingdom of Ireland, which united with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom in 1801. The Irish quarter was unaltered following the division of Ireland into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State in 1922.

The present arms do not include a representation of the United Kingdom&#x27;s fourth constituent country, Wales. It is instead represented heraldically by two royal badges, which use the Welsh dragon and the coat of arms of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth respectively.

== Description ==
=== Outside Scotland ===
At the centre of the arms is a quartered shield, depicting the three passant guardant lions of England in the first and fourth quarters, the rampant lion and double tressure flory-counterflory of Scotland in the second quarter, and a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. Surrounding the shield is the Order of the Garter, the United Kingdom&#x27;s most senior order of knighthood. The supporters are a crowned English lion on the dexter (heraldic right), and a chained Scottish unicorn on the sinister (heraldic left). Above the shield is a gold helmet, which has mantling of gold and ermine attached to it. On top of this is the crest, a crown with a crowned lion standing on it. Below the shield is a grassy mound, a type of compartment, on which are thistles, Tudor roses and shamrocks, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. In front of this is the motto , a French phrase meaning &#x27;God and my right&#x27;.

During the reign of Elizabeth II, the crowns depicted in this version of the royal arms were close representations of St Edward&#x27;s Crown. Following Charles III&#x27;s decision to use the Tudor Crown in his royal cypher, the College of Arms envisaged that the crown on the royal arms would also change. This would be similar to the design used from the beginning of Edward VII&#x27;s reign in 1901 to the end of George VI&#x27;s reign in 1952. However, , the St Edward&#x27;s Crown version remained in use. On 10 October 2024, a new design for the royal arms was unveiled.

=== In Scotland ===
The royal arms in Scotland use the same basic elements, but with distinctive Scottish symbolism. In the shield the Scottish arms occupy the first and fourth quarters and the English arms the second, giving the former precedence. The shield is surrounded by the collar and badge of the Order of the Thistle. The crest is a crowned red lion holding a sword and sceptre (representing the Honours of Scotland), facing forward sitting on a crown. Above it is the Scots motto &quot;, a contraction of the phrase &quot;. The supporters are a crowned and chained Scottish unicorn on the dexter, and a crowned English lion on the sinister. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective kingdom. The grassy mound beneath the shield contains only thistles; on it is a second motto, that of the Order of the Thistle: (no one will attack me with impunity). The crowns in the Scottish version of the arms are conventionally stylised to resemble the Crown of Scotland.

=== Blazon ===
Changes to the blazon of the royal arms are in the Royal prerogative, presumed to be under ministerial advice.

This table breaks down the blazons to enable comparison of the differences between the general arms and the arms used in Scotland.

==History==
===Arms of England, Scotland and Ireland===
The present royal arms originated in the separate arms of the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland; Wales had been incorporated into the Kingdom of England in the 16th century. In 1603, James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones, and, to symbolise this union of the crowns, the arms of England (which at that time were quartered with those of France) and Ireland were quartered with those of Scotland. Within Scotland, the Scottish arms were placed in the first and fourth quarters and those of England in the second, with the English arms taking precedence elsewhere.

Except during the Commonwealth and The Protectorate in the mid-seventeenth century, and the use by William III of an inescutcheon of Nassau, the arms remained unchanged until the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. 

=== Great Britain ===

The Acts of Union 1707 united the two kingdoms of England and Scotland into one Kingdom of Great Britain. The arms of the new kingdom impaled England and Scotland in the first and fourth quarters, representing their union, with France in the second and Ireland in the third. In 1714, the Elector of Hanover, George I, became king, and the arms of Hanover were placed in the fourth quarter.

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1801, Great Britain and Ireland were united to form the United Kingdom; the monarch&#x27;s claim to the French throne was at the same time dropped, and the French quarter removed from the coat of arms. The remaining quarters were rearranged so that, outside Scotland, England occupied the first and fourth, Scotland the second, Ireland the third, and Hanover an inescutcheon topped by an electoral bonnet. Within Scotland, the Scottish and English quarters were reversed. In 1816, the electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, and the bonnet was replaced with a crown.

In 1837, Victoria became queen of the United Kingdom but not Hanover, as the latter followed Salic law which barred women from the succession. The Hanoverian inescutcheon was therefore removed, and the royal arms reached the form they have retained to the present. The only changes since have been cosmetic, such as altering the depiction of the Irish harp so that it no longer includes a bare-breasted woman.

==== Development ====
====Changing styles====

The blazon of the royal arms has been changed only three times since the creation of the United Kingdom: in 1801, 1816 and 1837. But how these blazons are depicted has been subject to artistic interpretation and the preferences of the monarch under the royal prerogative.

The blazons of the royal arms do not specify any particular heraldic crown to be depicted in the achievement, using only the term &quot;imperial crown proper&quot; to indicate a crown with arches and in its natural colours. The first reference to the &quot;imperial crown&quot; of England was during the reign of Henry VIII in the Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532, which declared that &quot;this realm of England is an empire... governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the imperial Crown of the same&quot;. 

The actual form of the crown has varied over time. In England, the heraldic crown is ultimately based on St Edward&#x27;s Crown, which has four crosses pattée and four fleurs-de-lis around the rim and two arches. However, depictions have varied depending on the artist. Queen Victoria, for example, had favoured a crown with rounded arches of &quot;the type of an earlier time&quot; since at least the 1860s, and in about 1880, after she was proclaimed Empress of India, the heraldic crown was altered to give it a more imperial form by making the arches semi-circular.

After the accession of Edward VII, the War Office raised the issue of a standardised design of the crown for use by the British Army, as several crowns of different patterns were in use. In 1901, the king decided on a &quot;Tudor&quot; crown design based on the crown of Henry VII, as &quot;chosen and always used by Queen Victoria personally&quot;. This style was used until after the accession of Elizabeth II in 1952, when the design reverted to the style with depressed arches used by Charles II. The College of Arms envisages that Charles III will adopt a design similar to that used by Edward VII for the coat of arms, following the selection of such a crown on his royal cypher in 2022.

There have also been changes to the depiction of the Irish harp, with the frame variously depicted as a winged woman or as a Celtic harp, with the latter being more typical in the twentieth century, particularly since Elizabeth II.

==Usage==
===Restrictions===
The royal arms are the arms of dominion of the British monarch. Unlike ordinary armorial bearings they are not hereditary, with the right to bear them vested in the reigning sovereign, and by extension their government, as a royal prerogative. Members of the royal family are granted differenced arms.

Crown copyright applies in perpetuity to depictions of the royal arms and any of its constituent parts under the royal prerogative, and The National Archives restricts rights to reproduce them. Although Crown Copyright usually expires 50 years after publication, Section 171(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 made an exception for &#x27;any right or privilege of the Crown&#x27; not written in an act of parliament, thus preserving the rights of the Crown under the unwritten royal prerogative.

In addition, use of the royal arms and devices for commercial purposes is specifically restricted in the UK (and in countries which are party to the Paris Convention) under sections 4 and 99 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and its use is governed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office.

The royal arms may be displayed by holders of a royal warrant but may not be used as a trade mark and should only be displayed for the duration of the grant of a royal warrant. It is an offence under Section 12 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to give a false indication that any goods or services are supplied to the monarch or any member of the royal family.

=== UK usage ===
==== Government ====
The UK Government generally uses a simplified form of the arms that omits the helm and mantling, reduces the crest to the crown alone, and has no compartment. Use of the royal arms by government departments and agencies is governed by the Cabinet Office.

The royal arms feature on all Acts of Parliament, in the logos of government departments, on the cover of all UK passports (and passports issued in other British territories and dependencies), as an inescutcheon on the diplomatic flags of British Ambassadors, and on &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. It is also used in the British Overseas Territories, namely on all acts of the Anguilla House of Assembly and by the administrations of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the Pitcairn Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

The Scotland Office and the Advocate General for Scotland use the Scottish version of the arms, again without the helm or crest. The simplified Scottish royal arms were used as the day-to-day logo of the Scottish Executive until September 2007, when the body was rebranded as the Scottish Government and began using a logo incorporating the flag of Scotland. The Scottish Government continues to use the arms on some official documents, including Acts of the Scottish Parliament.

==== Judicial ====
The royal arms appear in courtrooms in England and Wales, typically behind the judge&#x27;s bench, and symbolise that justice comes from the monarch. One exception is the magistrates&#x27; court in the City of London, where both the royal arms and arms of the City of London Corporation appear behind the bench. Courtrooms in Scotland, in the same way, usually display the Scottish version of the royal arms. The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 prohibited the display of the royal arms in courtrooms or on court building exteriors in Northern Ireland, with some exceptions.

The arms are not displayed in the Middlesex Guildhall, which houses the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, as the remit of the former includes the four nations of the entire UK, and the latter is the final court of appeal for three independent republics and for the independent sultanate of Brunei Darussalam, not recognizing the judicial authority of the British monarch as their head of state, as well as for the various British territories and sovereign bases, the Crown dependencies, and other independent Commonwealth realms where the king is the head of state but separated from the judicial authority.

==== Royal Standard ====
A banner of the royal arms, known as the royal standard, is flown from buildings in which the monarch is resident or present. The Palace of Westminster, for example, usually flies the Union Flag, but flies the royal standard when the monarch is present for the State Opening of Parliament. When the monarch is not in residence at a palace in Scotland the royal banner of Scotland is flown; palaces in the rest of the UK fly the Union Flag.

==== Heraldry ====
The royal arms feature on the tabard worn by officers of arms of the College of Arms and Court of the Lord Lyon. These garments are worn at several traditional ceremonies, such as the annual procession and service of the Order of the Garter at Windsor Castle, the State Opening of Parliament, the coronation, and state funerals.

==== Coinage ====
The royal arms regularly feature on British coinage, and are used as a logo by the Royal Mint. In 2008 a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the royal arms. The full royal arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, which combine to form a complete depiction.

==== Armed Forces ====
The royal arms with the crest but without the helm is used as the rank insignia for Class 1 Warrant Officers in His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces.

==== Ecclesiastical ====
It is customary (but not mandatory) for churches of the Church of England and Church of Scotland to display the royal arms as the established church of England and the national church of Scotland respectively. If a church building of either denomination does not currently display the royal arms, permission from the Crown must be given before one can be used.

==== Corporate ====

Use of the royal arms and devices for commercial purposes is specifically restricted in the UK (and in countries which are party to the Paris Convention) under sections 4 and 99 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and its use is governed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office.

The royal arms may be displayed by select businesses which supply the royal household with goods or services and have been granted a royal warrant. But the arms may not be used as a trade mark and should only be displayed for the duration of the grant of a royal warrant. It is an offence under Section 12 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to give a false indication that any goods or services are supplied to the monarch or any member of the royal family.

The royal arms are incorporated into Imperial College London&#x27;s coat of arms, which developed from institutions founded and patronised by Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort.

=== Commonwealth usage ===
====Canada====
Several provincial and territorial courts in Canada make use the royal arms:
* The Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and Provincial Court of British Columbia
* The Court of Appeal for Ontario and some older courts in Ontario.
* The Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador and Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador
* The Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory and the Court of Appeal of Yukon
* The Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island and the Court of Appeal of Prince Edward Island

The Coat of arms of Canada is also closely modelled on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.

====Australia====
In Australia, the royal arms are used as a logo by the Parliament of Victoria and the Western Australian Legislative Council. It is also used by several state and federal courts, including:
* The seal of the Supreme Court of South Australia
* The Supreme Court of Victoria
* The Supreme Court of Tasmania
* The High Court of Australia, depicted alongside the Commonwealth Coat of Arms at the building&#x27;s entrance
* Court rooms in New South Wales where the royal arms may not be removed for practical or heritage reasons

The current royal arms are also used by Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;.

====New Zealand====
The &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot; displayed the royal arms until 1946. The newspaper &quot;The Press&quot; used the royal arms as its masthead until 2023.

====Irish Free State====
Historically, when the Irish Free State established its own diplomatic seals in the 1930s, the royal arms were depicted on the throne behind George V in a unique form by having the Irish harp in two quarters and the English arms in one.

== Royal family ==
Members of the British royal family are granted their own personal arms. In the past, the monarch&#x27;s younger sons used various differences; and married daughters of the monarch impaled the plain royal arms with their husbands&#x27; arms. But for many centuries now, all members of the royal family have had differenced versions of the royal arms settled on them by royal warrant. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point label; while grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who also bears a three-point label. The labels are always white (argent) and each prince or princess has individual marks to form his or her particular difference, except the Prince of Wales, who uses a plain white three-pointed label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an inescutcheon of the ancient arms of the Principality of Wales.

Queens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a queen regnant are not entitled to use the royal arms. Thus Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was granted his own personal arms. A notable exception to this rule was Prince Albert, who used the royal arms (differenced by a special label) quartered with his own Saxon royal arms.

Currently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the royal arms:

<text>Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions (PMQs, officially known as Questions to the Prime Minister, while colloquially known as Prime Minister&#x27;s Question Time) is a constitutional convention in the United Kingdom, currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting, during which the prime minister answers questions from members of Parliament (MPs).
The Institute for Government has described PMQs as &quot;the most distinctive and internationally famous feature of British politics.&quot; In the legislatures of the devolved nations of the UK, the equivalent procedure is known as First Minister&#x27;s Questions.

==History==
Although prime ministers have answered questions in parliament for centuries, until the 1880s, questions to the prime minister were treated the same as questions to other ministers of the Crown: asked without notice, on days when ministers were available, in whatever order MPs rose to ask them. In 1881 fixed time-limits for questions were introduced and questions to the prime minister were moved to the last slot of the day as a courtesy to the 72-year-old prime minister at the time, William Ewart Gladstone, so he could come to the Commons later in the day. In 1953, when Winston Churchill (in his late 70s at the time) was prime minister, it was agreed that questions would be submitted on fixed days (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

A Procedure Committee report in 1959 recommended that questions to the prime minister be taken in two fixed-period, 15-minute slots on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The recommendations were put into practice under Harold Macmillan during a successful experiment from 18 July 1961 to the end of the session on 4 August. The very first question was delivered by Labour MP Fenner Brockway, asking to which minister the UK ambassador to South Africa would be responsible. In response to the prime minister&#x27;s answer, Brockway said &quot;May I express our appreciation of this new arrangement for answering Questions and the hope that it will be convenient for the Prime Minister as well as useful to the House?&quot; PMQs were made permanent in the following parliamentary session, with the first of these on 24 October 1961.

The style and culture of PMQs has changed gradually over time. According to former Speaker Selwyn Lloyd, the now famous disorderly behaviour of MPs during PMQs first arose as a result of the personal animosity between Harold Wilson and Edward Heath; before this PMQs had been lively but comparatively civilised. In the past, prime ministers often opted to transfer questions to the relevant minister, and leaders of the opposition did not always take their allocated number of questions in some sessions, sometimes opting not to ask any questions at all. This changed during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, when the prime minister chose not to transfer any questions to other members of her Cabinet, and Labour leader Neil Kinnock began asking more questions than his predecessors. His successor, John Smith, established the precedent of always taking his full allocation of questions.

One of Tony Blair&#x27;s first acts as prime minister was to replace the two 15-minute sessions with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays, initially at 3 p.m. but since 2003 at noon. The allocated number of questions in each session for the leader of the opposition was doubled from three to six, and the leader of the third-largest party in the Commons was given two questions as opposed to one question beforehand. The first PMQs to use this new format took place on 21 May 1997.

During the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government from 2010 to 2015, Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as a member of the government, did not ask questions during PMQs. Instead, the leader of the second largest parliamentary opposition party at the time, Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), usually asked a single question later in the session, followed by at least one MP from another party such as the Scottish National Party or Plaid Cymru.

==Practice==

Backbench MPs wishing to ask a question must enter their names on the Order Paper. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the speaker. The speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen to ask a supplementary question if they &quot;catch the eye&quot; of the speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.

The leader of the opposition usually asks six questions at PMQs, either as a whole block or in two separate groups of three. If the first question is asked by a government backbencher, the leader of the opposition is the second MP to ask questions. If the first question is asked by an opposition MP, this will be followed by a question from a government MP and then by the questions from the leader of the opposition. The leader of the second largest opposition parliamentary party (the Liberal Democrats as of 2024) would then ask two questions.

The first formal question on the Order Paper, posed by simply saying &quot;number one, Mr [or Madam] Speaker&quot;, is usually to ask the prime minister &quot;if he [she] will list his [her] engagements for the day&quot;. The prime minister usually replies:

In the prime minister&#x27;s absence the deputy prime minister or first secretary of state usually replies:

The reason for such a question is that, historically, the prime minister may be questioned only as to those matters that the prime minister is directly responsible for. Such matters are relatively few in number, because many substantive matters are handled by the other Cabinet ministers. By requiring the prime minister to list their engagements, the members may then inquire whether the prime minister ought to be engaged in some other activity or be taking some other action.

Before listing the day&#x27;s engagements, the prime minister sometimes extends condolences or offers congratulations after significant events. During the Iraq War, Tony Blair introduced the practice of naming any British military personnel who had been killed in service since the last time he addressed the House. This practice was continued by Blair&#x27;s successors as prime minister. After this, the MP may ask a supplementary question about any subject that might occupy the prime minister&#x27;s time. Most MPs table the same engagements question and so after it has been asked for the first time, any other MPs who have tabled the same question are simply called to ask an untabled question, meaning that the prime minister will not know what questions will be asked.

Occasionally the first question tabled is on a specific area of policy, not the engagements question. This, though, is quite rare as it would allow the prime minister to prepare a response in advance; the non-descript question allows some chance of catching him or her out with an unexpected supplementary question.

At times of national or personal tragedy or crisis, PMQs have been temporarily suspended. The last such suspension occurred on 25 February 2009 when the speaker, at the request of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, suspended the Commons as a mark of respect following the unexpected death of Opposition leader David Cameron&#x27;s son. Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions was also suspended following the sudden death of the leader of the Labour Party, John Smith, in 1994.

PMQs has been filmed since 1989, and has been broadcast live since 1990. It is broadcast live in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two and BBC Parliament television channels. It is also broadcast outside the United Kingdom, most notably on the international pay television network BBC World News and the US cable network C-SPAN.

=== Absence of the prime minister or leader of the opposition ===
If the prime minister is away on official business when PMQs is scheduled, the role is usually filled by the deputy prime minister or first secretary of state. If these offices are not occupied or the deputy prime minister is not available, the next most senior member of the Cabinet will receive questions (such as the first secretary of state or the deputy leader of the government party). In the absence of the leader of the opposition, the opposition questions will be usually led by the next highest-ranking member of the Shadow Cabinet. From 1992 to 2020, a convention was in place that if either the prime minister or the leader of the opposition is absent, the other faction would nominate someone to stand, meaning that both sides were stood in for. This precedent was broken at Keir Starmer&#x27;s first PMQs as leader of the opposition, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalised due to illness with COVID-19. Dominic Raab, as first secretary of state, stood in for Johnson. On 16 September 2020, a member of Starmer&#x27;s household displayed COVID-19 symptoms, meaning he was self-isolating. As a result, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Shadow First Secretary of State Angela Rayner stood in for him putting questions to Johnson. Before 1992, the replacement would often question the prime minister or vice versa. For example, Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader of the Labour Party between 1983 and 1992, stood in for Neil Kinnock facing Margaret Thatcher on 38 occasions between February 1984 and July 1990.

Boris Johnson also became the first prime minister to answer PMQs outside the chamber virtually after having been told to isolate after meeting with Lee Anderson who later tested positive for COVID-19. Keir Starmer became the first leader of the opposition to ask questions remotely a month later after a member of his office staff contracted COVID-19.

During the Cameron–Clegg coalition, Nick Clegg answered 15 PMQs and William Hague twice, all opposite Harriet Harman. Harman had previously in her capacity as the deputy leader of the Labour Party and &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister, answered PMQs for Gordon Brown on 10 occasions between April 2008 and March 2010, all opposite William Hague. During the Second Cameron ministry, George Osborne answered three times, opposite Angela Eagle. In the Second May ministry, Damian Green replied twice, opposite Emily Thornberry, while David Lidington did so six times, opposite Thornberry and Rebecca Long-Bailey. On 2 October 2019, Diane Abbott became the first black MP to stand for PMQs and ask the six main questions when she challenged the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in his capacity as first secretary of state.

==Leaders at the dispatch box since 1961==
The most high-profile contributors at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions are the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, who speak opposite each other at the despatch box. Regular, fixed sessions have taken place since 1961, and the list below outlines the prime ministers since 1961 and opposition party leaders they faced across the floor of the House of Commons, as well as the secondary opposition leader since (usually the leader of third largest party within the House of Commons):

In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions is broadcast live via cameras within the Press Gallery inside the House of Commons on domestic national television channels BBC Two, the BBC News Channel, BBC Parliament, Sky News and GB News. It is also broadcast live on the national radio station BBC Radio 5 Live.

C-SPAN also has an archive of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions coverage going back to 1989 when it was first televised. There is no live radio coverage of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in that country.

Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions has been spoofed on the American late-night television sketch comedy &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In a C-SPAN interview in 1991, shortly after the network started to broadcast Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, then US President George H. W. Bush said, &quot;I count my blessings for the fact I don&#x27;t have to go into that pit that John Major stands in, nose-to-nose with the opposition, all yelling at each other.&quot;

<text>Martti Juhani Miettunen (17 April 1907 – 19 January 2002) was a Finnish politician who served twice as Finland&#x27;s prime minister, from 1961 to 1962 and again from 1975 to 1977.

Miettunen was born in Simo, the son of a smallholder. He studied agriculture, and worked as a farmer and an agricultural advisor before entering politics. He served in Parliament as a representative for the Agrarian Party from 1945 to 1958, and then served as Governor of the Province of Lapland from 1958 to 1973. He was awarded the honorary title of Counsellor of State in 1977.

Miettunen served as a cabinet minister for 4,300 days, the eighth-longest period of service in Finnish political history. He was also known as President Urho Kekkonen&#x27;s right-hand man.

He died at the age of 94 in the Kauniainen military hospital near Helsinki in early 2002.

<doc id="220545" wikidata="Q7271525" url="?curid=220545" title="Question Period">
<text>Question Period (QP; ), known officially as Oral Questions (), occurs each sitting day in the House of Commons of Canada—similarly in provincial legislatures—in which members of the parliament ask questions of government ministers (including the prime minister). According to the House of Commons Compendium, &quot;The primary purpose of Question Period is to seek information from the Government and to call it to account for its actions.&quot; 

It is similar in form to question time in other parliaments, mainly those following the Westminster system. 

In the Legislative Assemblies of Ontario and Manitoba (as well as in several other provinces), questions raised are formally referred as &quot;Oral Questions&quot;. In the Quebec National Assembly, the term is &quot;Oral Questions and Answers&quot;.

==History==
The first oral question occurred during the 1st Canadian Parliament, before rules had been established providing for formal questions. According to the record of debates for November 29, 1867, a question was posed to Chairman of the Printing Committee before Orders of the Day were called.

In the absence of formal rules, the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada exerted great control over form, nature, and admissibility of questions. The first codification of formal rules to govern Question Period occurred in April 1964, and subsequent rule changes have been adopted; however, the opinion of the Speaker carries the most weight, as the actions of the Speaker set precedents when a new Point of Order or questions arises about practices during Question Period.

==Current practice==
Question Period lasts 45 minutes pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), beginning no later than 2:15 pm or 11:15 am, as the case may be. Typically, 2:15 pm is the start time for Question Period Monday through Thursday, with Question Period starting at 11:15 am on Fridays. On Wednesdays, Question Period starts slightly after 2:15 pm due to the 2:00 pm singing of the National Anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot;.

Questions may be posed to either the prime minister, or any Minister of the Cabinet of Canada, who will answer the question unless the Speaker rejects the question under established rules or accepted custom. For example, although it is not codified, questions on current legal matters before the courts are not acceptable questions.

Question Period in Canada, as an instance of Question time in Westminster tradition, is similar to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; however, it is important to note that the Canadian version occurs daily as opposed to weekly, runs 45 minutes instead of 30, and questions may be asked to any cabinet member, not just the prime minister. In the UK Parliament, other Cabinet members have Question Time on other days, so it is a daily occurrence but to specific Ministers.

===Format===
At the start of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is possible for the question to be asked by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must be a member of the Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead questioner has two more questions permitted, referred to as supplementary questions. These questions may be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.

When the Official Opposition has exhausted its initial three questions, the lead questioners of the other officially recognized opposition parties are permitted an initial question and one supplementary question each, in order of size. In the 43rd Canadian Parliament, once the Official Opposition is finished, questions then come from the Bloc Québécois, then the New Democratic Party.

Throughout the remainder of Question Period, Members of officially recognized parties ask questions in rotation based upon party representation in the House. Members of the governing party may occasionally pose a question to one of their own. Members of political parties not officially recognized in the House and independent Members may also be recognized to ask questions, though not as often as Members of officially recognized opposition parties. Ministers and 
Parliamentary Secretaries do not ask questions.

===Rules===
Question Period has a reputation for being quite chaotic due to the commonplace cat-calling and jeering from non-participating MPs, but notwithstanding the heckling, Question Period is actually tightly regulated. Parties are only allowed to ask a predetermined number of questions based on the size of their caucus and must ask their questions in a specific order, predetermined by their party leadership for that day on a list given to the Speaker.

Questions and responses are all timed as well, to prevent excessive speeches, and the Speaker of the House can cut the microphones of members speaking after the specified time has elapsed. The parties may negotiate a maximum time limit for each question and answer; currently, this limit is 35 seconds for each.

As with other parliamentary procedures in the House, members of opposition parties must place questions through the Speaker, addressing them only indirectly to the minister responsible for the issue at hand. When asking questions, members address the Speaker as &quot;Mr. Speaker&quot; or &quot;Madam Speaker&quot; (&quot;Monsieur le président&quot; or &quot;Madame la présidente&quot; in French). There is no obligation for the minister referred to in the question to respond, and often the minister&#x27;s parliamentary secretary or a fellow cabinet member will rise to answer the question. This is particularly true when the minister addressed is not present in the House during Question Period, and arguably occurs most often when the Prime Minister is addressed on a specific issue, for which one of his ministers has more information.

Members are also not allowed to rise on Points of Order during Question Period and must first wait until Question Period has ended to raise them to the speaker.

==Bilingual nature==
Reflecting the nature of Bilingualism in Canada, Question Period is bilingual. Questions may be posed in either English or French, and responses may be in either official language. Although English was the primary language in parliament in its early days, French is now spoken just as much as English. Simultaneous interpretation is provided on English and French broadcasts of Question Period, on many news networks, as well as the Cable Public Affairs Channel (CPAC). Transcripts of Question Period are published in both official languages in the Canadian &quot;Hansard&quot;, as with any other proceedings in the House of Commons and its committees.

There is no guarantee that the answer will be provided in the same language as the question, and a Member relying on the simultaneous interpretation may respond to something differing slightly from the actual question asked. For the most part, bilingual Members respond to the question in the language in which it was asked.

The simultaneous translation provided to Members in the Chamber as well as visitors in the gallery is also available over the internet on either the website of the Parliament of Canada, or through services such as CPAC.

==Provincial equivalent==

The practice of holding a Question Period also takes place in provincial legislatures, where members of a provincial legislature may ask questions of provincial ministers. Question Period in provincial legislatures are also formally known as &quot;Oral Questions&quot; in the Legislative Assemblies of British Columbia and Manitoba, and &quot;Oral Questions and Answers&quot; in the Quebec National Assembly.

<doc id="220546" wikidata="Q116190" url="?curid=220546" title="Väinö Tanner">
<text>Väinö Alfred Tanner (; 12 March 1881 – 19 April 1966; surname until 1895 &quot;Thomasson&quot;) was a leading figure in the Social Democratic Party of Finland, and a pioneer and leader of the cooperative movement in Finland. He was Prime Minister of Finland in 1926–1927.

Tanner was born in Helsinki as the son of a railway brakesman of modest means. After matriculating from Ressu Upper Secondary School
in 1900, he studied at the business college &quot;Suomen Liikemiesten Kauppaopisto&quot; (one of two predecessors of the present-day Business College Helsinki). He also studied law, graduating as a jurist in 1911.

Tanner started work as a trainee at the &quot;Großeinkaufs-Gesellschaft Deutscher Consumvereine (GEG)&quot; in Hamburg, Germany, while still a student, and in 1903, after returning to Finland, became manager of &quot;Turun Vähäväkisten Osuusliike&quot;, then the largest cooperative retail society in Finland. He was later appointed to the supervisory board of the Helsinki-based cooperative &quot;Elanto&quot; in 1907, and also became chairman of &quot;Suomen Osuuskauppojen Keskuskunta (SOK)&quot; in 1909 and CEO of &quot;Elanto&quot; in 1915. He also served as president of the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) from 1927 until 1945.

He did not participate in the Finnish Civil War, maintaining a neutral attitude. When the war ended he became Finland&#x27;s leading Social Democratic Party (SDP) politician, and a strong proponent of the parliamentary system. His main achievement was the rehabilitation of the SDP after the Civil War. Väinö Tanner served as Prime Minister (1926–1927), Minister of Finance (1937–1939), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1939–1940), and after the Winter War Minister of Trade and Industry (1941–1942) and Minister of Finance (1942–1944).

Väinö Tanner&#x27;s legacy is in his directing the Finnish working class from their extremist ideology towards pragmatic progress through the democratic process. Under his leadership the Social Democrats were trusted to form a minority government already less than 10 years after the bloody civil war. Tanner&#x27;s minority socialist government passed a series of important social reforms during its time in office, which included a liberal amnesty law, reduced duties on imported foods, and pension and health insurance laws.

During President Relander&#x27;s brief illness Tanner, who held the post of prime minister, was even the acting president and Commander-In-Chief. In this role he even received the parade of the White guards on the 10th anniversary of the White victory. This was perceived as a remarkable development at the time. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Social Democrats formed several coalition governments with the Agrarian party. In the Winter War Väinö Tanner was the foreign minister. 
Väinö Tanner&#x27;s leadership was very important in forming the grounds and creating the Spirit of the Winter War which united the nation.

After the end of the Continuation War, Tanner was tried for responsibility for the war in February 1946, and sentenced to five years and six months in prison.

After the Continuation War, and while still in prison, Tanner became the virtual leader of a faction of the SDP which had strong support from the US. This faction eventually came out on top after a great deal of internal party strife lasting for much of the 1940s.
Tanner criticised Finland&#x27;s post-war doctrine known as Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine, in which Finnish foreign affairs were kept strictly neutral and friendly with the USSR. Tanner managed to return to the Finnish parliament as a representative in the 1951 parliamentary elections. The acting foreign minister at the time, Åke Gartz, insisted that the head of the Finnish Social Democratic Party Emil Skog should try to keep Tanner away from the party. Skog retorted by saying that if Tanner&#x27;s candidacy was blocked for foreign policy reasons, anyone else&#x27;s candidacy could be blocked in the upcoming election for any reason. Tanner would go on to win the 1957 SDP chairman election. Tanner won the race by 1 vote. The party was internally divided due to Tanner&#x27;s controversial past and eventually some representatives seceded and formed a new party called the Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders aka TPSL. TPSL eventually reunited with SDP in December 1972.

Tanner won his final SDP chairman election in 1960 and resigned from his parliamentary seat in 1962 and the SDP&#x27;s chairmanship in 1963, hence becoming the last member of the Eduskunta (Finnish parliament) elected in Finland&#x27;s first parliamentary election in 1907 to be involved in parliamentary work. Tanner is also the only Finnish politician to have served as a member of the Eduskunta for seven different decades, and is also one of only four Finnish politicians (the others being Veikko Vennamo, Paavo Väyrynen and Pekka Haavisto) to have been a candidate for President of Finland three times without winning. Due to his aforementioned criticism of the Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine, his relationship with the later-President of Finland Urho Kekkonen became extremely strained, and after Tanner died in 1966 Kekkonen did not attend his funeral because he was on a ski trip. Only with the blessing of a long-serving parliamentarian was the presidency allowed to be represented by an aide-de-camp and wreath at Tanner&#x27;s funeral.

==Personal life==
Tanner met his future wife Linda (née Anttila; 1882–1978) in 1907 at a meeting of the Social Democratic Association of Students. They entered into a common-law marriage in 1909 and formalised their marriage in 1918 after civil marriage was legalised in Finland. They had eight children, one of whom, (1912–1984), became a medical doctor and writer.

<text>The University of Helsinki (, ; UH) is a public university in Helsinki, Finland. The university was founded in Turku in 1640 as the Royal Academy of Åbo under the Swedish Empire, and moved to Helsinki in 1828 under the sponsorship of Tsar Alexander I. The University of Helsinki is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. In 2022, around 31,000 students were enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes.

As of 1 August 2005, the university complies with the harmonized structure of the Europe-wide Bologna Process and offers bachelor, master, licenciate, and doctoral degrees. Admission to degree programmes is usually determined by entrance examinations, in the case of bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and by prior degree results, in the case of master and postgraduate degrees. 

The university is bilingual, with teaching by law provided both in Finnish and Swedish. Since Swedish, albeit an official language of Finland, is a minority language, Finnish is by far the dominating language at the university. Teaching in English is extensive throughout the university at master, licentiate, and doctoral levels, making it a &quot;de facto&quot; third language of instruction.

It is a member of various prominent international university networks, such as Europaeum, UNICA, the Utrecht Network, and is a founding member of the League of European Research Universities. The university has also received international financial support for global welfare; for example, in September 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense provided the university with more than four million euros in funding for the treatment of MYC genes and breast cancer.

==History==

===Royal Academy of Åbo 1640–1828===
The first predecessor of the university, The Cathedral School of Åbo, was presumably founded in 1276 for education of boys to become servants of the Church. As the university was founded in 1640 by Queen Christina of Sweden (1626–1689) in Turku (Sw. Åbo), as the Åbo Kungliga Akademi (), the senior part of the school formed the core of the new university, while the junior year courses formed a grammar school. It was the third university founded in the Swedish Empire, following Uppsala University and the Academia Gustaviana in Dorpat (predecessor to the University of Tartu in Estonia).

===Imperial Alexander University in Finland 1828–1919===

The second period of the university&#x27;s history covers the period when Finland was a Grand Duchy, a state ruled by the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917. When Grand Duchy of Finland was established in 1809, the Grand Duke Alexander I expanded the university and allocated substantial funds to it. Following the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, higher education within the country was moved to Helsinki, the new administrative heart and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland, in 1828, and renamed the &quot;Imperial Alexander University in Finland&quot; in honour of the late benefactor of the university. In the capital the primary task of the university was to educate the Grand Duchy&#x27;s civil servants.

The university became a community subscribing to the new Humboldtian ideals of science and culture, studying humanity and its living environment by means of scientific methods. The new statutes of the university enacted in 1828 defined the task of the university as promoting the development of &quot;the Sciences and Humanities within Finland and, furthermore, educating the youth for the service of the Emperor and the Fatherland&quot;.

The Alexander University was a centre of national life that promoted the birth of a fully independent Finnish State and the development of Finnish identity. The great men of 19th century Finland, Johan Vilhelm Snellman, Johan Ludvig Runeberg, Elias Lönnrot and Zachris Topelius, were all involved in the activities of the university. The university became a major center of Finnish cultural, political, and legal life in 19th century Finland, and became a remarkable &quot;primum mobile&quot; of the nationalist and liberal cultural movements, political parties, and student organisations.

In the 19th century university research changed from being collection-centred to being experimental, empirical, and analytical. The more scientific approach of the university led to specialisation and created new disciplines. As the scientific disciplines developed, Finland received ever more scholarly knowledge and highly educated people, some of whom entered rapidly evolving industry or the government.
===University of Helsinki 1919–present===

The third period of the university&#x27;s history began with the creation of a fully independent Republic of Finland in 1917, and with the renaming of the university as the &quot;University of Helsinki&quot;. Once Finland declared its full independence in 1917, the university was given a crucial role in building the nation state and, after World War II, the welfare state. Members of the academic community promoted the international relations of the new state and the development of its economic life. Furthermore, they were actively involved in national politics and the struggle for equality.

In the interwar period the university was the scene of a conflict between those who wanted to advance the usage of Finnish language in the university, to the detriment of Swedish and those who opposed such move. Geographer Väinö Tanner was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish language usage. Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland initiated a campaign collecting 153 914 signatures in defense of the Swedish language that were handed to the parliament and government in October 1934. On an international front academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representations of Finland in their respective countries warning about a weakening of the Nordic unity that would result from diminishing the role of Swedish in the University of Helsinki.

In the 20th century, scholarly research at the University of Helsinki reached the level of the European elite in many disciplines. This was manifested, among other things, by international recognitions granted to its professors, such as the Fields Medal received by the mathematician Lars Ahlfors (1936), the Nobel Prize in Chemistry granted to Professor A.I. Virtanen (1945) and the Nobel Prize in Medicine shared by Professor Ragnar Granit (1967). In the Continuation War the university was heavily damaged by bombs during a soviet air raid on 27 February 1944.

After World War II, university research focused on improving Finnish living conditions and supporting major changes in the structure of society and business. The university also contributed to the breakthrough of modern technology.

The progress of scientific development created many new disciplines and faculties at the University of Helsinki. At present the university comprises 11 faculties, 500 professors and almost 40,000 students. The university has established as its goal to further its position as one of Europe&#x27;s top multidisciplinary research universities.

In March 2014, two people were arrested and in June 2014 sentenced to prison for three years for plotting a mass murder at the university.

==Organization==

===Faculties===
The university is divided into eleven faculties. They are listed below in the official order used by the university, reflecting both the history of the university and the hierarchy of disciplines at the time when the university was established:
* Faculty of Theology (established 1640)
* Faculty of Law (established 1640)
* Faculty of Medicine (established 1640)
* Faculty of Arts (Faculty of Philosophy established 1640 and split 1852, independent Arts section 1863, independent faculty 1992)
* Faculty of Science (Faculty of Philosophy established 1640 and split 1852, independent Science section 1863, independent faculty 1992)
* Faculty of Pharmacy (Faculty of Philosophy established 1640, split from the Faculty of Science 2004)
* Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences (Faculty of Philosophy established 1640, split from the Faculty of Science 2004)
* Faculty of Educational Sciences (independent section 1974, independent faculty 1992, reorganized and renamed 2004, reorganized and renamed 2017)
* Faculty of Social Sciences (established 1945)
* Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry (established 1898, independent faculty 1924)
* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (established as an independent college in 1945, incorporated into the University of Helsinki in 1995)

The university also has several independent institutes, such as research centres and libraries, the most notable of which are perhaps the National Library of Finland and Helsinki University Library. Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies is another independent institute within the University of Helsinki, an Institute for Advanced Study, which is modeled upon the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Previous directors include Raimo Väyrynen (2002–2004) and Juha Sihvola (2004–2009).

==Academics==
===University rankings===
University of Helsinki is ranked at 101-150th in the world by the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities published by Shanghai Jiao Tong University. According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2023, the University of Helsinki is ranked at 121st overall in the world. In 2024 THE–QS World University Rankings list, the University of Helsinki was ranked 115th.

===International Master&#x27;s Degree Programmes===
The University of Helsinki offers a wide range of master&#x27;s degree programmes, taught entirely in English. The scope of the programmes is 120 ECTS credits, completed with two years of full-time study. Some programmes are organised by the University of Helsinki along with other Finnish and foreign universities. All programmes comply with the national legislation governing university education and are, therefore, recognised globally.

==Campuses==
The university is located on four main campuses. Originally, the entire university was located in the very centre of Helsinki, but due to the rapid growth of the university since the 1930s, premises have been built and acquired in other areas.

===City Centre Campus===
The historical City Centre Campus has been the hub of activity ever since the university moved from Turku to Helsinki in the early 19th century. The campus has a central location and reflects the architectural style of this part of the city. The university buildings in the city center house the Faculties of Theology, Law, Arts, Behavioural Sciences and Social Sciences plus administrative functions. Most of the buildings on the campus have a major architectural significance ranging from the dominating Neo-Classical, through the Jugendstil, to 20th century Modernism.

The City Centre Campus, extending around the historical centre of Helsinki, Senate Square, and Kruununhaka city district, is the administrative heart of the University of Helsinki and has the largest concentration of faculties in Helsinki.

After the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, Emperor Nicholas I ordered the Royal Academy of Turku be moved to the new capital city of the Grand Duchy of Finland, Helsinki, where the Imperial Alexander University in Finland began to operate the next year. Helsinki was to become Finland&#x27;s window to the world; a European city to which the university belonged as an integral part. Carl Ludvig Engel, architect, was given the assignment of designing an Empire-style main building next to Senate Square, facing the Imperial Senate. The main building was completed in 1832. Thanks to the lessons learnt from the fire of Turku, the library was built separate from other premises. The library and several faculty buildings in the campus were also designed by Engel.
The main building as well as other buildings of the campus were badly damaged during the Soviet bombings in World War II but rebuilt after the war.

The plan concerning the concentration of university facilities dating back to the 1980s, aimed to achieve a closer unity between facilities. The City Centre Campus does not stand out from the rest of the urban environment but is a part of the city, in line with the old university tradition. The university facilities still form a functional and coherent whole, consisting not only of historically valuable buildings, but also of facilities for 20,000 students and 3,000 teachers and other staff.

===Kumpula Campus===
The Kumpula Campus, housing the Faculty of Science, is located four kilometers north from the centre of Helsinki near tram lines 6 and 8. The campus houses the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, and Geosciences and Geography.

The university departments were located in Kumpula for the first time in 1978 when the City of Helsinki leased the area for the university. A planning competition for the city plan for the area was held a year earlier. In the 1980s, the Accelerator Laboratory of the Department of Physics was quarried into Kumpula rock and the construction of Kumpula Botanical Garden began in 1987. It was not, however, until the 1990s when the construction work proper began, transforming the area into a significant campus.

The Chemicum, the building housing the Department of Chemistry and VERIFIN (Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention), and the Physicum, which provides facilities for physics, geology and geography are located on Kumpula campus surrounding a square named after the Finnish Nobel prize winner, A. I. Virtanen. Kumpula Campus Library is also located in the Physicum. The Kumpula Sports Centre is planned for the recreational use of both university staff and students and citizens of Helsinki alike. Completed in 2004, the Exactum provides facilities for seismology, computer science and mathematical subjects, as well as administrative services.

The campus comprises two main parts: the Botanical Garden, surrounding the old building stock of Kumpula manor and the modern new building stock located a couple of hundred metres north of the manor. The greenness of the area makes the dynamic campus stand out as a unique, distinctive complex. The campus offers study and research facilities for 6,000 students and 1,000 teachers. The Finnish Meteorological Institute moved to the area in 2005. That building is known as Dynamicum.

===Meilahti Campus===
The Meilahti Campus, with the Faculty of Medicine, is a part of the Meilahti Hospital District on the edge of the city centre. Just a few kilometres from the City Centre Campus, the Meilahti area has been transformed into a cradle of top research on medicine, &#x27;Medilahti&#x27;. Established in the 1930s, the Women&#x27;s Clinic was accompanied by Finland&#x27;s leading hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) in 1966. The same year saw the completion of facilities for theoretical subject departments on Haartmaninkatu street. The building is now being renovated and extended.

The latest completed facilities in the campus include the National Library of Health Sciences (Terkko) and the research and teaching centre Biomedicum that houses several research institutes including the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Neuroscience Center (NC), and Minerva Foundation Institute for Medical Research.

The Ruskeasuo premises, including the Department of Dentistry, Institute for Oral Health, Department of Public Health and Department of Forensic Medicine, also belong to the Meilahti campus. The Meilahti and Ruskeasuo areas form a close-knit complex providing a meeting place for medical education, international top-level research and nursing. The campus is a workplace for 2,000 students and 1,500 teachers.

Thanks to the years-long project to combine the teaching facilities of the Faculty of Medicine, Meilahti is now a functional unity of medicine and health care. The atmosphere in the campus inspires people in their studies, research and international co-operation.

Although the Meilahti campus is intertwined with the rest of Meilahti district, it succeeds in forming a clear-cut campus area with its hospital-type building stock.

===Viikki Campus===
The Viikki Campus is located in the semi-suburban greenspace of the Viikki area, some 8 kilometres north-east of the city centre. It houses the Faculties of Agriculture and Forestry, Biosciences, Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy. It is an important concentration in the field of biosciences, even by European standards. Indeed, it is often called the bioscience campus or the &quot;green campus&quot;.

In addition to biosciences, the campus is home to a wide range of other life science researchers and students in such fields as environmental science, veterinary medicine, food research and economics. Numerous international research groups also work on the Viikki Campus. The Viikki Campus is the location of four faculties, three independent research institutes (Institute of Biotechnology (BI), Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE) and Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE)) and the Viikki Science Library.

It also attracts an increasing number of businesses to the Helsinki Business and Science Park. The Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute and the Finnish Food Safety Authority, Evira, have also moved to Viikki and negotiations are under way to relocate MTT Agrifood Research Finland to Viikki to complement the Department of Economics and Management.

The Viikki Campus unites a multidisciplinary science community of more than 6,500 students and 1,600 teachers, a residential area emphasising ecological values and the natural surroundings, including recreational areas and nature reserves, and forms a unique whole. The campus also has the Viikinlahti conservation area, which is particularly popular among bird watchers.

==Libraries and museums==

===The National Library of Finland===

The National Library of Finland is the foremost research library in Finland and the main branch of the University of Helsinki&#x27;s library system. The National Library of Finland is the oldest and largest scholarly library in Finland as well as one of the largest independent institutes at the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the collection, description, preservation and accessibility of Finland&#x27;s printed national heritage and the unique collections under its care. The National Library also serves as a national service and development centre for the library sector and promotes national and international cooperation in the field.

===The Helsinki University Main Library===

The Main Library of the university is used by students for research and studying. Located a few blocks down the street from the university&#x27;s main building in the city center, the new Main Library was opened in 2012 in the Kaisa House. The new library merged the undergraduate library and four dispersed faculty libraries of the city center campus to a collection of approximately 1.5 million books. The architecture of the new building, designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, has been praised and received several awards.

===The Helsinki University Museum===
The Helsinki University Museum is the museum of the University of Helsinki and was located until June 2014 on &quot;Snellmanninkatu&quot; off the north-east corner of Senate Square. Museums main exhibition moved to the University Main Building in 2015.

Helsinki University Museum was established in 2003 by merging the former University Museum specialising in the history of the University of Helsinki, the Museum of Medical History, the Museum of the History of Veterinary Medicine, the Museum of the History of Dentistry and the Collections of Craft Science. To complement the new conglomeration of museums, the Mineral Cabinet, which today belongs to the Finnish Museum of Natural History, returned to its original location in the Arppeanum building. Each year the museum also holds one or two temporary exhibitions in a specially designed area. Museums exhibition in Arppeanum Building was closed in June 2014. New main exhibition was opened in the Main Building in March 2015.

The University Museum is in charge of the preservation and conservation of the university&#x27;s valuable museum collections and property: old tuition and research equipment, furniture and works of art. The museum maintains an index register of all valuables that are kept in the facilities of the university. The museum also provides library, archive and photographic services pertaining to the history of the university and the history of medical science.

===Finnish Museum of Natural History===

The Finnish Museum of Natural History is a research institution under the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the national botanical, zoological, geological and paleontological collections consisting of samples from around the world. The collections serve scientific, public informational and educational purposes.

==Student life==

===Student Union===

The Student Union of the University of Helsinki (&quot;Helsingin yliopiston ylioppilaskunta&quot;, HYY) was founded in 1868. , it has 32,000 members and is one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest student organizations, with assets of several hundred million euros. Among other things, it owns a good deal of property in the city centre of Helsinki. The union has been at the centre of student politics from the 19th Century nationalist movements, through the actions of the New Left in the 1960s, up to the present. Its governing assembly consists of parties which are connected to faculty organisations, the Student Nations, and the mainstream political parties.

===Student nations===
The student nations are student organisations that provide extra-curricular activities to students. Along with the faculty-based organisations, the nations provide one of the main nodes of student social life. The nations at University of Helsinki have a special legal status in the Universities Act. There are 15 nations at the university, each one representing a historic region or province of Finland, with four of these representing Swedish-speaking regions. Membership is optional.

==Notable alumni, faculty, and staff==

== Chancellors ==

<doc id="220549" wikidata="Q917874" url="?curid=220549" title="Åbo Akademi University">
<text>Åbo Akademi University ( , ) is the only exclusively Swedish language multi-faculty university in Finland (or anywhere outside Sweden). It is located mainly in Turku (Åbo is the Swedish name of the city) but has also activities in Vaasa. Åbo Akademi should not be confused with the Royal Academy of Åbo, which was founded in 1640, but moved to Helsinki after the Turku fire of 1827 and is today known as the University of Helsinki.

Åbo Akademi was founded by private donations in 1918 as the third university in Finland, both to let Turku again become a university town and because it was felt that the Swedish language was threatened at the University of Helsinki. The Finnish University of Turku was founded in 1920, also by private donations and for similar reasons. Åbo Akademi was a private institution until 1981, when it was turned into a public institution.

As the only uni-lingually Swedish multi-faculty university in the world outside Sweden and consequently the only one in Finland, Åbo Akademi University is responsible for higher education for a large proportion of the Swedish-speaking population. This role has many implications for education and research as well as for the social environment. As there are few students in most subjects, cooperation between faculties and with other universities is very important.

A minority of students are Finnish speakers who have passed a university entrance Swedish language test. While Turku itself is a bilingual city, the university provides a strong Swedish environment. Most of the students, regardless of their original language, will be functionally bilingual when finishing their studies.

== Organisation ==
The university consists of four faculties:
*Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology (located in Turku)
*Faculty of Education and Welfare Studies (located in Vaasa)
*Faculty of Science and Engineering (located in Turku, with some activity also in Vaasa)
*Faculty of Social Sciences, Business and Economics (located in Turku, with some activity also in Vaasa)

In addition, there are several other units and joint programs, such as:
* Language Centre
* Centre for Lifelong Learning
* Donner Institute for Research in Religious and Cultural History
* Institute of Human Rights
* Turku PET Centre (jointly run by Turku University, Åbo Akademi and the Turku University Hospital)
* Turku Centre for Computer Science (TUCS) (in co-operation with Turku University, among others)
* Turku Centre for Biotechnology (in co-operation with Turku University, among others)
* Vasa övningsskola, located in Vaasa, is the normal school of the teacher training programme.

While the university turned into a public institution, the foundation Stiftelsen för Åbo Akademi remained. Besides maintaining many of the university buildings, it is also a significant donor.

== Rectors ==
The following people have served as rectors of Åbo Akademi:

* 1918–1921: Edvard Westermarck

<text>Aimo Kaarlo Cajander (4 April 1879 – 21 January 1943) was the Prime Minister of Finland up to the Winter War.

Cajander was born in Uusikaupunki, and became a botanist, a professor of forestry 1911–34; director-general for Finland&#x27;s Forest and Park Service 1934–1943; Prime Minister in 1922, 1924, and 1937–1939; chairman of the National Progressive Party 1933–1943; and Member of Parliament.

Cajander came into politics in 1922 when President Ståhlberg asked him to take office of prime minister. He had not earlier participated actively in politics. Ståhlberg invited him as prime minister second time in January 1924. Cajander&#x27;s short-lived cabinets were merely caretakers before parliamentary elections.

Cajander joined in 1927 National Progressive Party and in 1928 he was chosen as Minister of Defence. Cajander was elected to the Parliament in 1929. When Kyösti Kallio was elected president in 1937, Cajander was asked as the chairman of the National Progressive Party to form majority government. Cajander formed a coalition government of the two largest parties in the parliament - Social Democrats and Agrarian League. Cajander was idealist who did not believe yet in August 1939 that Soviet Union would attack Finland. Partly for this reason the Finnish Army was forced to the fight inadequately equipped. He died in Helsinki, aged 63.

Cajander&#x27;s name is remembered for &quot;Model Cajander&quot;, the fashion of many Finnish soldiers in Winter War: the army was poorly equipped, so mobilized reserves were given a utility belt, an emblem to be attached to the hat — to comply with the Hague Conventions; and a rifle. Otherwise, they had to use their own clothes and equipment.

==Cabinets==
* Cajander I Cabinet
* Cajander II Cabinet
* Cajander III Cabinet

== Awards ==

* Order of the Three Stars, 1st Class (April 10, 1937)
* Order of the Holy Lamb, Grand Cross (1941)
* Honorary doctorate of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (1924)

<doc id="220553" wikidata="Q84482" url="?curid=220553" title="Friedrich von Wieser">
<text>Friedrich Freiherr von Wieser (; 10 July 1851 – 22 July 1926) was an early (so-called &quot;first generation&quot;) economist of the Austrian School of economics. Born in Vienna, the son of Privy Councillor Leopold von Wieser, a high official in the war ministry, he first trained in sociology and law. In 1872, the year he took his degree, he encountered Austrian-school founder Carl Menger&#x27;s &quot;Grundsätze&quot; and switched his interest to economic theory. Wieser held posts at the universities of Vienna and Prague until succeeding Menger in Vienna in 1903, where along with his brother-in-law Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk he shaped the next generation of Austrian economists including Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and Joseph Schumpeter in the late 1890s and early 20th century. He was the Austrian Minister of Commerce from August 30, 1917, to November 11, 1918.

Wieser is renowned for two main works, &quot;Natural Value&quot;, which carefully details the alternative-cost doctrine and the theory of imputation; and his &quot;Social Economics&quot; (1914), an ambitious attempt to apply it to the real world. His explanation of marginal utility theory was decisive, at least terminologically. It was his term (building on von Thünen&#x27;s &quot;Grenzkosten&quot;) that developed into the standard term &quot;marginal utility&quot;, not William Stanley Jevons&#x27;s &quot;final degree of utility&quot; or Menger&#x27;s &quot;value&quot;. His use of the modifier &quot;natural&quot; indicates that he regarded value as a &quot;natural category&quot; that would pertain to any society, no matter what institutions of property had been established.

The economic calculation debate started with his notion of the paramount importance of accurate calculation to economic efficiency. Above all, to him prices represented information about market conditions and are thus necessary for any sort of economic activity. Therefore, a socialist economy would require a price system in order to operate. He also stressed the importance of the entrepreneur to economic change, which he saw as being brought about by &quot;the heroic intervention of individual men who appear as leaders toward new economic shores&quot;. This idea of leadership was later taken up by Joseph Schumpeter in his treatment of economic innovation.

Unlike most other Austrian School economists, Wieser rejected classical liberalism, writing that &quot;freedom has to be superseded by a system of order&quot;. This vision and his general solution to the role of the individual in history is best expressed in his final book &quot;The Law of Power&quot;, a sociological examination of political order published in his last year of life.

== Biography ==
Born in Vienna on 10 July 1851, Wieser spent his childhood and adolescence in the same city. He was interested since youth in law, history and sociology. He studied law at the University of Vienna beginning in 1868. His lifelong passion for political economy was first ignited when he read Herbert Spencer&#x27;s (Introduction to the Study of Sociology).

After ten years of public service as a government employee, Wieser was awarded in 1875 a scholarship to the Heidelberg University in order to study political economy with Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, a friend from his youth who later became his brother-in-law. Both men were disciples of Carl Menger, Wieser&#x27;s senior by 11 years. Although neither Wieser nor Böhm-Bawerk studied under Menger directly, they were greatly influenced by reading
Menger&#x27;s (Principles of Economics) (1871), which was the work that had initially inspired the two men to study political economy. The three are considered the first generation of the Austrian School of economics.
After a successful postdoctoral habilitation in 1884, (&quot;On the Origin and the Main Laws of the Value of the Factors&quot;), a prelude to his value theory, Wieser was named that same year as an associate professor at Charles University in Prague, where he stayed until 1903 when he succeeded Menger at the University of Vienna.

In 1889, Wieser was named &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; (ordinary professor) at the Charles University. That same year, he also published his (&quot;Natural Value&quot;), with which he initiated the debate on the value of factors of production and from which are derived two of his major contributions: his value theory and the related imputation theory.

Motivated by introducing the innovations of the Austrian School, he published (&quot;The Austrian School and the Theory of Value&quot;) in 1891 and (&quot;The Value Theory&quot;) in 1892. Later, he collaborated in other notable works, such as (&quot;Resumption of payments species in Austria-Hungary&quot;) in 1893 and (&quot;Theory of urban land rents&quot;) in 1909. He also served as editor for two articles in the &quot;Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot;: &quot;Die österreichische Schule der Wirtschaft&quot; (&quot;The Austrian School of Economics&quot;) and &quot;Böhm-Bawerk&quot;, both in 1884.

In 1903, Wieser was awarded a chair as a full professor at his alma mater, the University of Vienna, where he taught a new generation of economists, including Ludwig von Mises, Joseph Schumpeter and his most faithful disciple Friedrich Hayek. He developed a monetary theory inspired by the research of Carl Menger and he applied himself during the following years to the problems of the quantity theory of money. In his last 25 years, he dedicated himself to sociology, which he believed must go hand-in-hand with economics for the fullest understanding of human society. By combining these disciplines, he was able to forge a new vision of economic policy.

In 1911, he published (&quot;The Nature and Content of Theoretical Economics Major National&quot;) which preceded yet another major contribution, alternative cost (or opportunity cost) theory, which was drawn from his study (&quot;Theory of Social Economy&quot;), published in 1914. It was here that he first coined the term &quot;opportunity cost&quot;.

Also attributed to him is the creation of the term &quot;marginal utility&quot; () due largely to the influence of Léon Walras and Vilfredo Pareto, both of the Lausanne School. This has led some scholars to not consider his later works as belonging to the Austrian School. Even his disciple Ludwig von Mises said in his autobiography &quot;Memoirs&quot; (1978) that Wieser had misunderstood the gist of the subjectivism of the Austrian School and was actually a member of the Lausanne School. However, in both he also presents a clear methodological individualism and a rejection of historicism of the German School, so at first blush it is difficult to justify his exclusion from the Austrian School.

In 1914, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk died, thus marking the end of a lifelong friendship and striking a hard blow to Wieser.
In 1917, Wieser was named a member of the Austrian House of Lords and granted the title of Baron. He was also appointed Minister of Commerce in the Austrian Cabinet, which post he held until the end of World War I in 1918. However, his activity was hindered by Richard Riedl, Energy Minister and clear proponent of economic interventionism, leaving only matters of secondary importance to Wieser&#x27;s jurisdiction.

His last works were (&quot;The History of State Power&quot;) in 1923 and a sociological study titled (&quot;The Law of Power&quot;) in 1926.

Wieser died on 22 July 1926 in Salzburg, where he is buried. Two of his hitherto unpublished works were published posthumously, namely (&quot;Money&quot;) in 1927, which summarizes his monetary theory; and (&quot;Collected Papers&quot;) in 1929. This latter book included a tribute resulting from the collaboration of renowned economists like Knut Wicksell, but it was censored during World War II.

== Achievements ==

Wieser&#x27;s most famous contributions are the imputation theory drawn from his 1889 work (&quot;Natural Value&quot;) and the &quot;Alternative Cost (or Opportunity Cost) Theory&quot; drawn from his 1914 work (&quot;Social Economics&quot;) in which he coined the term &quot;opportunity cost&quot;. He is credited with the economic distinction between public goods and private goods subsequently used by Friedrich August von Hayek and eight of his disciples, and with developing the concept of marginal utility ().

Wieser also stressed the importance of the entrepreneur to economic change, which he saw as being caused by &quot;the heroic intervention of individual men who appear as leaders at new economic frontiers&quot;. This idea of management was later expounded upon by Joseph Alois Schumpeter in his treatment of economic innovation. Value theory was revolutionary because it opened the debate on the question of economic value, introducing an objective calculation to a subjective theory. It was one of the first mathematical solutions to the problem of determining prices for factors of production. His imputation theory amended possible errors in the theory of his teacher Carl Menger and is still used today in microeconomics in consumer research to calculate the systematic replacement of factors of production.

Another of Wieser&#x27;s fundamental contributions to economics is the &quot;alternative cost theory&quot; (now called the opportunity cost theory), which had been ignored by Alfred Marshall and British economists. Based on the work of Vilfredo Pareto, Wieser created the concepts of marginal utility and opportunity cost, which led economists to the study and analysis of scarcity and the allocation of scarce resources.

Wieser thus perfected the theory of Carl Menger by introducing a definition of cost, the opportunity cost, compatible with the theory of marginal utility. He also used Carl Menger&#x27;s monetary theory from which he devised his own monetary theory presenting a study of possible influences on monetary value that can change the relationships between natural and monetary economics.

Wieser&#x27;s most important contributions is that thanks to his familiarity with sociology he combined the Austrian theory of utility with an evolutionary theory of institutions offering solutions to the paradox between private property and the maximization of utility. Wieser said that idealized classical and neoclassical models neglect basic concepts such as the possibility of monopolies and the existence of economies of scale. Wieser claimed that idealized refined and self-contained models may not be useful tools for economic policy, resulting therefore in a suboptimal solution. In his treatise (&quot;Theory of Social Economy&quot;), he posited the concept of social economy () using the performance of intervention in certain cases as a benchmark to assess policy effectiveness.

== Economic theories ==
From his book (&quot;Natural Value&quot;), published in Vienna in 1889, are extracted two of Wieser&#x27;s three relevant theories, his value theory and the imputation theory, although both had had their geneses in previous studies. Adding to his contribution was also the theory originally known as the alternative cost theory (now called the opportunity cost theory), which was published in 1914 in (Theory of Social Economy). Finally, also worth mentioning is his monetary theory.

=== Value theory ===
Wieser&#x27;s value theory attempts to establish a method for calculating economic value and states that the factors of production have a value due to the utility they have conferred on the final product, i.e. marginal utility, as opposed to the theory held by his teacher Carl Menger which states that the value factor is the value of the input when contributed to the final product. Wieser&#x27;s value theory was presented along with his imputation theory in his work (&quot;Natural Value)&quot;, published in Vienna in 1889, although his examination of the subject begins in his 1884 postdoctoral study (&quot;On the Origin and the Principal Laws of the Value of Factors&quot;).

Wieser asserts that natural value () is a neutral phenomenon, independent of the economic system. His idea of natural value tends to highlight how the value of property is continuously dependent on the distribution of income between different social classes, so that in the presence of a situation greatly lacking in equidistribution, goods or services provided with little social utility can be of great value and vice versa.

The economy deals with a social process and therefore must be based on a concept of social economics (), which implies certain institutional actions. In the first part of his treatise (&quot;Theory of Social Economics&quot;), Wieser carefully explains his view of general economic equilibrium. Aware of the idealized assumptions of this economy, he seeks to define with pinpoint accuracy the conditions under which resources would be allocated to ensure the highest possible utility. Social economics should therefore serve as the benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of administrative intervention in the market economy: 

This assertion is based on the fact that for Wieser natural value would exist in a perfect communist state due to the absence of inequalities of wealth and error. In this case, value would result only from the available quantity and from profits. However, he states that in the real world natural value is only one element in the formation of price. Other factors that influence prices are the distribution of purchasing power, errors, fraud and coercion.

His idea of natural value highlights how the economic value of property changes depending on the distribution of income between different social classes so that when income distribution is far from equal, goods or services provided with little social utility can be of great value and vice versa. Therefore, Wieser explicitly states his assumptions considering the cases in which the exchange value (price) differs from the real value (marginal utility):
* Antinomy of value. If monopolies arise then the individual entrepreneur will be able to increase his own utility at the expense of social utility, thus creating a state of antinomy. Friedrich argues that competition can correct this because it reduces the entrepreneurs economic power and forces prices to fall.
* Disparity in the purchasing power of consumers leads to over-produced goods to meet the needs of persons with high ability to pay, and too few goods to meet the needs of poor people.
Some economists of the Austrian School maintained that the value of the factors of production is not the individual contribution of each factor in the final product, but rather the value of the most valuable use that can be made of the last good (the marginal utility before reaching the Pareto optimal point). The opposing view held by the classical economists such as Adam Smith is the labor theory of value.

There are practical applications such as:
* Coined the term &quot;marginal utility&quot; and gave shape to the concept.
* Was revolutionary because it provided a new insight into the debate on the issue of economic value.
* Established assumptions concerning intervention, explicitly considering cases where the exchange value (price) differs from the actual value (marginal utility).
* Tried to provide a solution to the paradox of private property and maximizing utility.
* Still relevant today, especially in the field of study of consumer microeconomics.

=== Imputation theory ===
Wieser based his &quot;theory of imputation&quot; on the assumption that factors of production are combined in fixed proportions in each industry, but at different rates in different industries. It was one of the first mathematical solutions to the problem of determining the prices of factors of production.

Previously, some economists such as Carl Menger and others of the Austrian School maintained that the value of factors of production is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value is the value of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher Carl Menger as overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.
* Industry 1: X + Y = 300
* Industry 2: 6X + Z = 900
* Industry 3: 4Y + 3Z = 1700 ⇒ X = 100, Y = 200, Z = 300.

Given that a factor is used in the production of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the &quot;least valuable&quot; good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.

The following can be considered applications of Wieser&#x27;s theory of imputation:
* Linear programming, which deals with the case of discontinuous replacement of the factors. This approach is essentially the application of Wieser&#x27;s theory of imputation to a single company. The business problem is to maximize total output by a set of linear constraints.
* Albert Aftalion used the theory as an argument against socialism in his 1923 work &quot;Les fondements du Socialisme: Étude critique&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of Socialism: Critical Study&quot;). This work states that prices provide key information on the conditions of the market and are necessary for any economic activity. A socialist system that purported to be effective would have to use a price system to operate.

=== Alternative cost theory ===
The alternative cost theory (or opportunity cost theory) is a theory of enormous importance that comes from his (&quot;Theory of Social Economy&quot;), published in 1914, although his arguments were foreshadowed in his work (&quot;The Nature and Main Content of Theoretical State Economics&quot;), published in 1911. Wieser coined the term &quot;opportunity cost&quot; and performed a detailed study of the subject.

Opportunity cost is associated with a famous controversy from the early 20th century, where disciples of English economist Alfred Marshall were opposed to the continental economists of the Austrian School, the head of which was Friedrich von Wieser, with his theory of alternative or opportunity cost. The debate focused on the following points:
* For the English, cost was a technical concept, the spending needed to produce something.
* For the Austrians, cost was a result of demand, as this would determine the level of production, depending on the willingness of buyers to pay that cost. Since demand is dependent upon the action of buyers, utility would determine a thing&#x27;s cost rather than technology. In this context, the Austrian concept of opportunity cost claimed to ruin the British parametric concept of cost. The opportunity cost would be that which the purchaser would willingly forgo in agreeing to pay the cost of the option chosen.

The most notable feature of the concept is that opportunity cost would only make sense if the opportunity were fixed or reasonably limited. That is, if there is a conflict in performing multiple investments or actions, simultaneously or consecutively, it would not be feasible to have to choose among all the alternatives.

Thus, if a person has several options, you can calculate the opportunity cost of choosing one, but can we calculate a universal opportunity cost, which would include all the options? The prevailing opinion was that the opportunity cost could not be applied outside of cases of limited resources. This led some economists to limit the object of economics to &quot;exceptional&quot; resource situations (an idea still present in all economics textbooks). Still unknown are the consequences that might follow from an economic science that has no fixed limits outside of the economic system in terms of availability of goods.

There are practical applications such as:
* Wieser coined the term &quot;opportunity cost&quot;.
* Wieser gave shape to the theory that marked the beginning of the distinction between accounting cost (&quot;the cost of production&quot;) and economic cost (&quot;the cost of production&quot; + the opportunity cost of not being able to obtain alternative).

=== Monetary theory ===
Wieser also developed a monetary theory. It was inspired by the research of Carl Menger, in particular by his study of currency, which discussed both the historical evolution of money and the theory of its value. Wieser used the theory of marginal utility as a basis for his monetary theory. It was initially rejected; in fact, some authors tried to prove that marginalism necessarily failed when used as a basis for building such theories. However, his disciple Ludwig von Mises studied Wieser&#x27;s theory and fleshed it out, creating the complex upon which he built the German concept of (money).

Wieser conducted a further study on the effects of change in a currency&#x27;s value on the relationship between the natural economy and the monetary economy.

There are practical applications such as:
* It was later applied to the problem of the quantity theory of money.
* It provided a new monetary theory within the Austrian School and conducted a useful study on one specific type of possible influence on monetary value.
* Provided a basis for a further and still relevant study of monetary theory by his pupil Ludwig von Mises.

== Social economics ==
In his later years, Wieser ventured into the study of Sociology, and this resulted in his 1914 publication, (&quot;Theory of Social Economy&quot;), from which is derived his theory of alternative cost or opportunity. &quot;Das Gesetz der Macht&quot; (&quot;The Law of Power&quot;), published in 1926, was his latest publication, a great sociological study from which we draw the following conclusions.

Wieser tried to explain the relationships and social forces through the study of history, and he concluded that economic forces held a prominent role in social evolution. Despite his interest in collective goals, such as economic well-being, Wieser adopted an individual approach, explicitly rejecting collectivism, approaching a more liberal stance and establishing the essential difference between social economics in general and socialist economics.

Social economy (in the original German, ) treats humanity as a whole as an ideal economic subject and contrasts it with nature, so that considerations of conflicting interests or economic justice become as irrelevant as they would to the economy of Robinson Crusoe: 

For Wieser, the individual is the root of all decisions. Decisions are made in the face of certain restrictions. Institutions are what define the restrictions on individual decisions. The reflection of these findings in political economy is apparent in actions such as:
* The regulation of imperfectly competitive firms whenever there are benefits of capital that are being lost.
* Progressive taxation based on decreasing marginal utility. The state should not try to offset all the inequalities of income and property by means of progressive taxation, but rather progressive taxation should be developed within the doctrine of diminishing marginal utility, i.e. every new tax adds a certain diminishing amount of utility. Thus, an unconscionable progressive tax, for example on the wealthy, would violate the spirit of privacy of Wieser&#x27;s social economics.
* The duty of the state as producer of public goods. Wieser created the distinction between public goods and private goods that in the future would be seized upon by his disciple Friedrich Hayek.
* Intervening in the balance of social power between companies and unions for the benefit of workers, who could otherwise only hope to earn their marginal productivity.

These conditions, under which resources would be allocated to ensure the greatest value, describe his model of an ideal economy, which he calls &quot;social economics&quot; in the first part of his treatise entitled (&quot;Theory of Social Economics&quot;). He made idealized assumptions using his model as the benchmark standard for evaluating the effectiveness of administrative intervention in the market economy.

Thus Wieser&#x27;s Social Economics is, in effect, a socialist economy in which, to achieve greater productivity, scarce resources are assigned by an omnipresent, benevolent planner with direct and accurate insight sufficient to know the intensities of satisfactions and needs experienced by individual members of society, which all have exactly the same tastes and the same scales of utility and receive the same incomes. Moreover, their directions are followed without question by a completely docile workforce.

== Wieser and the new liberalism ==
When labeling Wieser a &quot;neoliberal&quot;, particular emphasis is placed on the definition of Ludwig von Mises. The English edition of his 1927 book, &quot;Liberalismus&quot;, uses the term &quot;neoliberalism&quot; to translate what Mises called in German (new liberalism). In this book, Mises uses the term to designate socialists posing as liberals (a term he later replaced with &quot;pseudoliberals&quot;), leaving in Mises&#x27;s view Wieser under this definition for being a Fabian socialist. Also in his later book &quot;Socialism&quot;, he applies the neoliberal label to liberal supporters of the then new subjective theory of value, including Carl Menger and Wieser. 

When Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser began their careers in science, they were not focused on economic policy issues, much less in the rejection of intervention promoted by classical liberalism. Their common vocation was to develop an economic theory on a firm basis. To do this, following the course initiated by Carl Menger, Wieser, along with his friend and brother-in-law Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, disapproved of the policies of interventionism that the Austrian government, as all governments of the time, had adopted, arguing that only the free market could allow more efficient economic and social development.

Wieser believed that he could contribute to a return to liberal policies, both by explaining his economic vision in his books and articles as well as by teaching it in his role as university professor at the University of Prague and University of Vienna. In addition, his positions within the Austrian ministries allowed him to adopt more or less liberal economic policies. However, it was his liberal vision that separated him from the British economists of his era, discarding classical and neoclassical idealized models that did not contemplate the possibility of monopolies or the existence of economies of scale: 

Wieser did not acknowledge essentialism or any teleological version of causality. As opposed to the historical method of the German historicist school, he developed a logical method, with both its deductive slope as well as its inductive slope (see interpolation and extrapolation). Economics has, like Mathematics and Logic, an &quot;a priori&quot; character rather than the empirical character of science. Thus, empirical phenomena are considered continuously variable, meaning that social developments have no parameters or constants, only variables, which makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to extract historical laws or make predictions. This point is the epicenter of the methodological discussion between the Austrian School and the German School.
In what little Wieser wrote about methodology, he stated that economics is a kind of applied psychology for which the procedure is introspection, claiming similarity between Economics and sociology in that both attempt to achieve a more successful social reality of man, promoting the idea of utility that reports on each good and each individual. Aside from abandoning essentialism, both Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser advocated objectively considering subjective factors, setting aside ideas that believe in the existence of an objective superhuman (essentialism) and theories of subjective elements that are incapable of objective measures (teleology of causality).

== Legacy ==
Joseph Schumpeter stressed Wieser&#x27;s originality, saying: &quot;There is hardly another author who owes as little to other authors as Wieser, fundamentally to none except Menger and to him only a suggestion – with the result that for a long time many fellow economists did not know what to do with Wieser&#x27;s work. Of his edifice, everything is his intellectual property, even where what he says has already been said before him&quot;.

<doc id="220556" wikidata="Q208220" url="?curid=220556" title="Tadao Ando">
<text>is a Japanese autodidact architect whose approach to architecture and landscape was categorized by architectural historian Francesco Dal Co as &quot;critical regionalism&quot;. He is the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.

==Early life==
Ando was born a few minutes before his twin brother in 1941 in Minato-ku, Osaka, Japan. At the age of two, his family chose to separate them and have Tadao live with his great-grandmother. He worked as a boxer and fighter before settling on the profession of architect, despite never having formal training in the field. Struck by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Imperial Hotel on a trip to Tokyo as a second-year high school student, he eventually decided to end his boxing career less than two years after graduating from high school to pursue architecture. He attended night classes to learn drawing and took correspondence courses on interior design. He visited buildings designed by renowned architects like Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Louis Kahn before returning to Osaka in 1968 to establish his own design studio, Tadao Ando Architects and Associates.

==Career==

===Style===


Ando was raised in Japan where the religion and style of life strongly influenced his architecture and design. Ando&#x27;s architectural style is said to create a &quot;haiku&quot; effect, emphasizing nothingness and empty space to represent the beauty of simplicity. He favors designing complex spatial circulation while maintaining the appearance of simplicity. A self-taught architect, he keeps his Japanese culture and language in mind while he travels around Europe for research. As an architect, he believes that architecture can change society, that &quot;to change the dwelling is to change the city and to reform society&quot;. &quot;Reform society&quot; could be a promotion of a place or a change of the identity of that place. Werner Blaser has said, &quot;Good buildings by Tadao Ando create memorable identity and therefore publicity, which in turn attracts the public and promotes market penetration&quot;.

The simplicity of his architecture emphasizes the concept of sensation and physical experiences, mainly influenced by Japanese culture. The religious term Zen, focuses on the concept of simplicity and concentrates on inner feeling rather than outward appearance. Zen influences vividly show in Ando&#x27;s work and became its distinguishing mark. In order to practice the idea of simplicity, Ando&#x27;s architecture is mostly constructed with concrete, providing a sense of cleanliness and weightlessness (even though concrete is a heavy material) at the same time. Due to the simplicity of the exterior, construction, and organization of the space are relatively potential in order to represent the aesthetic of sensation.

Besides Japanese religious architecture, Ando has also designed Christian churches, such as the Church of the Light (1989) and the Church in Tarumi (1993). Although Japanese and Christian churches display distinct characteristics, Ando treats them in a similar way. He believes there should be no difference in designing religious architecture and houses. As he explains,

We do not need to differentiate one from the other. Dwelling in a house is not only a functional issue, but also a spiritual one. The house is the locus of heart (kokoro), and the heart is the locus of god. Dwelling in a house is a search for the heart (kokoro) as the locus of god, just as one goes to church to search for god. An important role of the church is to enhance this sense of the spiritual. In a spiritual place, people find peace in their heart (kokoro), as in their homeland.

Besides speaking of the spirit of architecture, Ando also emphasises the association between nature and architecture. He intends for people to easily experience the spirit and beauty of nature through architecture. He believes architecture is responsible for performing the attitude of the site and makes it visible. This not only represents his theory of the role of architecture in society but also shows why he spends so much time studying architecture from physical experience.

In 1995, Ando won the Pritzker Prize for architecture, considered the highest distinction in the field. He donated the $100,000 prize money to the orphans of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

===Buildings and works===

Tadao Ando&#x27;s body of work is known for the creative use of natural light and for structures that follow natural forms of the landscape, rather than disturbing the landscape by making it conform to the constructed space of a building. Ando&#x27;s buildings are often characterized by complex three-dimensional circulation paths. These paths weave in between interior and exterior spaces formed both inside large-scale geometric shapes and in the spaces between them.

His &quot;Row House in Sumiyoshi&quot; (Azuma House, 住吉の長屋), a small two-story, cast-in-place concrete house completed in 1976, is an early work which began to show elements of his characteristic style. It consists of three equal rectangular volumes: two enclosed volumes of interior spaces separated by an open courtyard. The courtyard&#x27;s position between the two interior volumes becomes an integral part of the house&#x27;s circulation system. The house is famous for the contrast between appearance and spatial organization which allow people to experience the richness of the space within the geometry.

Ando&#x27;s housing complex at Rokko, just outside Kobe, is a complex warren of terraces and balconies, atriums and shafts. The designs for Rokko Housing One (1983) and for Rokko Housing Two (1993) illustrate a range of issues in traditional architectural vocabulary—the interplay of solid and void, the alternatives of open and closed, the contrasts of light and darkness. More significantly, Ando&#x27;s noteworthy engineering achievement in these clustered buildings is site specific—the structures survived undamaged after the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995. &quot;New York Times&quot; architectural critic Paul Goldberger argues that:

Ando is right in the Japanese tradition: spareness has always been a part of Japanese architecture, at least since the 16th century; [and] it is not without reason that Frank Lloyd Wright more freely admitted to the influences of Japanese architecture than of anything American.&quot;

Like Wright&#x27;s Imperial Hotel in Tokyo Second Imperial Hotel 1923-1968, which did survive the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, site specific decision-making, anticipates seismic activity in several of Ando&#x27;s Hyōgo-Awaji buildings.

In 2003, Ando was commissioned by soap opera heir William Bell, Jr. and his wife Maria to design a house for an almost oceanfront site on the East Pacific Coast Highway in the Paradise Cove area of Malibu, California. The house (designed with WHY Architects) is a modernist concrete structure in an &quot;L&quot; shape, with six bedrooms and walls of glass. It has been described as minimalist and &quot;echoey&quot;. Construction completed in 2014, being prolonged due to the oceanfront location, soft soil, and California&#x27;s extensive building codes. 7,645 cubic yards of unusually high quality concrete were used in the construction of the house, with its rebar specially treated to resist corrosion. The installation of the concrete in the driveway, garage, and parking areas in 2015 won an award for precision from the American Concrete Institute. Ando also designed a series of furniture pieces for the interior. In May 2023, couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z purchased the house through a trust for $200 million. It was the most expensive single-family home sold in the United States in 2023. and surpassed California&#x27;s previous record price for a residence, set by businessman Marc Andreessen in 2021 for the adjacent house.

<doc id="220559" wikidata="Q1276720" url="?curid=220559" title="Henry Mackenzie">
<text>Henry Mackenzie FRSE (August 1745 – 14 January 1831, born and died in Edinburgh) was a Scottish lawyer, novelist and writer sometimes seen as the Addison of the North. While remembered mostly as an author, his main income came from legal roles, which led in 1804–1831 to a lucrative post as Comptroller of Taxes for Scotland, whose possession allowing him to follow his interest in writing.

==Biography==
Mackenzie was born at Liberton Wynd in Edinburgh on 26 July 1745. His father, Dr Joshua Mackenzie, was a distinguished Edinburgh physician and his mother, Margaret Rose, belonged to an old Nairnshire family. Mackenzie&#x27;s own family descended from the ancient Barons of Kintail through the Mackenzies of Inverlael.

Mackenzie was educated at the High School and studied law at University of Edinburgh. He was then articled to George Inglis of Redhall (grandfather of John Alexander Inglis of Redhall), who was attorney for the crown in the management of exchequer business. Inglis had his Edinburgh office on Niddry Wynd, off the Royal Mile, a short distance from Mackenzie&#x27;s family home.
In 1765 he was sent to London for his legal studies, and on his return to Edinburgh he set up his own legal office at Cowgatehead off the Grassmarket, apparently as a partner with Inglis (but appearing in directories more as a rival), while he concurrently acted as attorney for the Crown.

Mackenzie had tried for several years to interest publishers in what would become his first and most famous work, &quot;The Man of Feeling&quot;, but they rejected it. Finally, Mackenzie published it anonymously in 1771, but to instant success. The &quot;Man of Feeling&quot; is a weak creature, dominated by futile benevolence, who goes up to London and falls into the hands of those who exploit his innocence. The sentimental key in the book shows the author&#x27;s acquaintance with Sterne and Richardson, but in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s summary assessment, his work lacked the story construction, humour and character of those writers.

A clergyman from Bath named Eccles claimed authorship of the book, supporting his pretensions with a manuscript full of changes and erasures. Mackenzie&#x27;s name was then officially announced, but Eccles appears to have convinced some people. In 1773 Mackenzie published a second novel, &quot;The Man of the World&quot;, whose hero was as consistently bad as the Man of Feeling had been &quot;constantly obedient to every emotion of his moral sense&quot;, as Sir Walter Scott put it. &quot;Julia de Roubigné&quot; (1777) is an epistolary novel.

The first of his dramatic works, &quot;The Prince of Tunis&quot;, was staged in Edinburgh in 1773 with some success, but others failed. Mackenzie belonged to a literary club in Edinburgh, where papers in the manner of &quot;The Spectator&quot; were read. This led to the establishment of the weekly &quot;Mirror&quot; (23 January 1779 – 27 May 1780), of which Mackenzie was editor and chief contributor. It was followed in 1785 by a similar paper, the &quot;Lounger&quot;, which ran for nearly two years and included one of the earliest tributes to Robert Burns.

In 1783, Mackenzie was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He became its Literary President in 1812–1828 and Vice President in 1828–1831. At this stage he was listed as an &quot;attorney at the exchequer&quot; living at Browns Square off the Grassmarket.

Mackenzie was an ardent Tory. He wrote many tracts intended to counteract doctrines of the French Revolution, contributing to the &quot;Edinburgh Herald&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Brutus&quot;. Most remained anonymous, but he acknowledged his &quot;Review of the Principal Proceedings of the Parliament of 1784&quot;, a defence of the policy of William Pitt written at the desire of Henry Dundas. He was rewarded in 1804 with the office of comptroller of the taxes for Scotland.

In 1776 Mackenzie married Penuel, daughter of Sir Ludovic Grant of Grant. They had eleven children. He was in later years a notable figure in Edinburgh society, nicknamed the Man of Feeling, but in fact a hard-headed man of affairs with a kindly heart. Some of his literary reminiscences appeared in his &quot;Account of the Life and Writings of John Home, Esq.&quot; (1822). He also wrote a &quot;Life of Doctor Blacklock&quot;, prefixed to the 1793 edition of the poet&#x27;s works.
In 1805 Mackenzie was living in a townhouse at 55 George Square. In 1806 he moved to the newly completed house at 6 Heriot Row, where he lived as its first occupant until his death. All Heriot Row houses are relatively large but No. 6 has four bays, not three, making it a third larger than its neighbours.

In 1807 &quot;The Works of Henry Mackenzie&quot; were published surreptitiously, and he then himself superintended the publication of his &quot;Works&quot; (8 vols., 1808). There is admiring but discriminating criticism of his work in a &quot;Prefatory Memoir&quot; affixed by Sir Walter Scott to an edition of Mackenzie&#x27;s novels in Ballantyne&#x27;s &quot;Novelist&#x27;s Library&quot; (vol. v., 1823).

==Family==
Mackenzie&#x27;s 1776 marriage to Penuel Grant, daughter of Sir Ludovic Grant, made him an uncle by marriage to Ludovick Grant-Ogilvy, 5th Earl of Seafield. His eldest son, Joshua Henry Mackenzie (1777–1851) was a senator of the College of Justice known as Lord MacKenzie. He is buried with his father in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Two other sons, Robert and William, worked for the East India Company. His son Holt Mackenzie was an EIC administrator and privy councillor.

He had two daughters, Margaret and Hope. His nephew, Joshua Henry Davidson (1785–1847) was First Physician in Scotland to Queen Victoria.

==Death==

Henry Mackenzie died on 14 January 1831 at his Georgian townhouse at 6 Heriot Row. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, in a grave facing north in the centre of the north retaining wall.

==Freemasonry==
MacKenzie was a Scottish Freemason initiated into Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, (Edinburgh, Scotland), on 2 December 1784.

==Trivia==
A small cottage in Colinton is known as &quot;Henry MacKenzie&#x27;s Cottage&quot;. The building was listed based on a &quot;historical connection&quot;, but appears absurd, as it never featured among Mackenzie&#x27;s official addresses. It may therefore have been home to a namesake and so listed under false pretences.

<text>Everything&#x27;s Eventual is a 2002 collection of 11 short stories and 3 novellas by American writer Stephen King.

==Stories==

&quot;The Little Sisters of Eluria&quot; is part of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series.

==Story order==
In the introduction to the book, King describes the unusual method he used to sort the stories:

==Audio versions==

The unabridged digital audiobook edition includes all fourteen stories, but the physical book-on-cd versions of the stories are spread out over several products. &quot;L.T.&#x27;s Theory of Pets&quot; is the only story not included in any of the book-on-cd collections, but rather as a standalone product.

&quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual: Five Dark Tales&quot; contains these stories:

* &quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual&quot; – read by Justin Long
* &quot;Autopsy Room Four&quot; – read by Oliver Platt
* &quot;The Little Sisters of Eluria&quot; – read by Boyd Gaines
* &quot;Luckey Quarter&quot; – read by Judith Ivey
* &quot;The Road Virus Heads North&quot; – read by Jay O. Sanders

&quot;The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales&quot; contains these stories:

* &quot;The Man in the Black Suit&quot;
* &quot;All That You Love Will Be Carried Away&quot;
* &quot;The Death of Jack Hamilton&quot;
* &quot;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French&quot;

&quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual: Volume 2&quot; is a retitled edition of &quot;The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales&quot;, along with the addition of &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;. It contains these stories:

* &quot;The Man in the Black Suit&quot;
* &quot;All That You Love Will Be Carried Away&quot;
* &quot;The Death of Jack Hamilton&quot;
* &quot;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French&quot;

&quot;Blood and Smoke&quot; contains these stories:

* &quot;1408&quot;
* &quot;In the Deathroom&quot;
* &quot;Lunch at the Gotham Cafe&quot;

&quot;L. T.&#x27;s Theory of Pets&quot; and &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; are available as individual single-story productions.

==Film adaptations==
Of the stories King wrote for this collection, two became films and another is in the works. The novella &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; became a
direct-to-video film by the same name, released in 2004 and directed by Mick Garris, who made many films and TV miniseries of King&#x27;s works, and the film &quot;1408&quot; (2007) appeared in theaters, starring John Cusack. &quot;The Death of Jack Hamilton&quot; was adapted for the screen for the first time as part of King&#x27;s &quot;Dollar Baby&quot; deal, and an official teaser trailer for the film was released on September 1, 2012, with an expected release date in 2013.

<doc id="220565" wikidata="Q335351" url="?curid=220565" title="Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville">
<text>Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, PC, FRSE (28 April 1742 – 28 May 1811), styled as Lord Melville from 1802, was the trusted lieutenant of British prime minister William Pitt and the most powerful politician in Scotland in the late 18th century.

Dundas was instrumental in the encouragement of the Scottish Enlightenment, in the prosecution of the war against France, and in the expansion of British influence in India. Prime Minister Pitt appointed him Lord of Trade (1784–1786), Home Secretary (1791–1794), President of the Board of Control for Indian Affairs (1793–1801), Secretary at War (1794–1801) and First Lord of the Admiralty (1804–1805). As a political boss, Lord Dundas&#x27;s deft and almost absolute power over Scottish politics during a long period in which no monarch visited the country led to him being nicknamed &quot;King Harry the Ninth&quot;, the &quot;Grand Manager of Scotland&quot; (a play on the masonic office of Grand Master of Scotland), and &quot;The Uncrowned King of Scotland.&quot; He was, however, a controversial figure, over his amendment to a motion for abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, which called for gradual abolition. At that time, the leaders of the abolitionist movement sought an immediate end to the slave trade, while the West Indian interests opposed any abolition at all.

==Background and education==
Dundas was born in Edinburgh on 28 April 1742 in the house known as &#x27;Bishop&#x27;s Land&#x27; (a former lodging of the Archbishop of St Andrews) on the Royal Mile. He was the fourth son of Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord President of the Court of Session, by his second wife, Anne Gordon, daughter of Sir William Gordon of Invergordon. He first attended Dalkeith Grammar School before an attack of smallpox interrupted his studies, after which he moved to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, before enrolling at the University of Edinburgh to study law.

While a student, he was a member of the Edinburgh University Belles Lettres Society, participating in its meetings and gaining his first experience of public speaking at the society&#x27;s debates.

==Legal career==
Dundas set up his legal offices at the head of Fleshmarket Close on the Royal Mile.

Becoming a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1763, he soon acquired a leading position in the Scottish legal system. He became Solicitor General for Scotland in 1766; but after his appointment as Lord Advocate in 1775, he gradually relinquished his legal practice to devote his attention more exclusively to public affairs.

From 1776–78, Dundas acted as counsel to an escaped slave, Joseph Knight, who had been purchased in Jamaica and later taken to Scotland. As a young man Knight tried to escape from his owner, and when that failed he launched a legal battle for his freedom. The case went to Scotland&#x27;s highest civil court, where Dundas led Knight&#x27;s legal team, in the case of &quot;Knight v. Wedderburn&quot;. Dundas was assisted by prominent members of the Scottish Enlightenment, and also the writer Samuel Johnson, whose biographer James Boswell later wrote: &quot;I cannot too highly praise the speech which Mr. Henry Dundas generously contributed to the cause of the sooty stranger. ...And I do declare, that upon this memorable question he impressed me, and I believe all his audience, with such feelings as were produced by some of the most eminent orations of antiquity. .&quot; Dundas argued that &quot;as Christianity gained ground in different nations, slavery was abolished&quot;, and, noting an earlier anti-slavery ruling in &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot; in England, Dundas said &quot;he hoped for the honour of Scotland, that the supreme Court of this country would not be the only court that would give its sanction to so barbarous a claim.&quot; Dundas concluded his remarks by stating: &quot;Human nature, my Lords, spurns at the thought of slavery among any part of our species.&quot; His pleading in Scotland&#x27;s highest court was successful, and the Court ruled: &quot;the dominion assumed over this Negro, under the law of Jamaica, being unjust, could not be supported in this country to any extent&quot;. The result was a landmark decision that declared that no person could be a slave on Scottish soil. Michael Fry said that Dundas&#x27;s success in &quot;Knight v Wedderburn&quot; was &quot;instrumental in prohibiting not only negro slavery but also native serfdom in Scotland.&quot;

Until 1785, he served also as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. He was created a Legum Doctor by the University of Edinburgh on 11 November 1789, was Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow from 1781 to 1783, and on 2 February 1788 was appointed Chancellor of the University of St Andrews. He was also a trustee for the University of Edinburgh and South Bridge.

==Political career==
=== Election to Parliament: the early years ===
In 1774, Dundas was returned to Parliament for Midlothian, and joined the party of Frederick North, Lord North; he was a proud Scots speaker and he soon distinguished himself by his clear and argumentative speeches. He was appointed Lord Advocate in 1775. His name appears in the 1776 minute book of the Poker Club. In 1778, Dundas made an attempt at proposing a Bill to relieve Scottish Catholics of their legal disabilities, but in response to severe riots in Edinburgh and Glasgow abandoned the project. After holding subordinate offices under William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne and Pitt, he entered the cabinet in 1791 as Secretary of State for the Home Department.

=== Cessation of the slave trade ===

On 2 April 1792, abolitionist William Wilberforce sponsored a motion in the House of Commons &quot;that the trade carried on by British subjects, for the purpose of obtaining slaves on the coast of Africa, ought to be abolished.&quot; He had introduced a similar motion in 1791, which was soundly defeated by MPs, with a vote of 163 opposed, 88 in favour. Dundas was not present for that vote, but when it was again before MPs in 1792, Dundas tabled a petition from Edinburgh residents who supported abolition. He then went on to affirm his agreement in principle with Wilberforce&#x27;s motion: &quot;My opinion has been always against the Slave Trade.&quot; He argued, however, that a vote for immediate abolition would be ineffective, as it would drive the slave trade underground or into the hands of foreign nations, beyond Britain&#x27;s control. He stated: &quot;this trade must be ultimately abolished, but by moderate measures&quot;. He suggested that slavery and the slave trade should be abolished together, and proposed an end to hereditary slavery, which would have enabled the children born to present-day slaves to become free persons upon reaching adulthood. He then introduced an amendment that would add the word &quot;gradual&quot; to the Wilberforce motion. The amendment was adopted, and the motion passed with a vote of 230–85. For the first time, the House of Commons voted to end the slave trade.

Three weeks after the vote, Dundas tabled resolutions setting out a plan to implement gradual abolition by the end of 1799. At that time he told the House that proceeding too quickly would cause West Indian merchants and landowners to continue the trade &quot;in a different mode and other channels&quot;. He argued that &quot;if the committee would give the time proposed, they might abolish the trade; but, on the contrary, if this opinion was not followed, their children yet unborn would not see the end of the traffic.&quot; MPs ignored his cautions, and voted in favour of ending the trade in slaves by the end of 1796. The motion and resolutions later failed to win the necessary support of the House of Lords, which deferred consideration then dropped the issue altogether.

Alternative measures were proposed later in the 1790s. Dundas spoke against specific proposals tabled in 1796, while reiterating his support for abolition in principle, but abstained from voting. The loss of momentum was connected to three years of an ongoing war on three continents, including with revolutionary France.

It was not until 1807 that the House of Lords voted in favour of abolishing the trade in slaves. Historian Stephen Farrell has noted that by that time, the political climate had changed, and the economic advantages of abolition had become apparent. The Slave Trade Act 1807 prohibited the trade in slaves in the British Empire. Ownership of slaves, however, remained legal in most of the British Empire until passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.

Between 1792 and 1807, when the slave trade was eventually abolished, another half a million Africans were transported into slavery in the British colonies. Dundas insisted that any abolition of the slave trade could not succeed without the support of West Indian colonial legislatures. Abolitionists argued that West Indian assemblies would never support such measures, and that by making the abolition of the slave trade dependent on colonial reforms, Dundas was in effect indefinitely delaying it. There is evidence, however, that Dundas had secured agreement of the West Indians before proposing the eight-year timeline. Recent peer-reviewed scholarship has also identified new archival evidence showing that Dundas had the support of several leading abolitionists, while the West Indian slave owners opposed his plan just as much as they opposed immediate abolition.

A few years after passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807, Wilberforce and Dundas encountered each other. Wilberforce recorded the event as follows: &quot;We did not meet for a long time and all his connexions most violently abused me. About a year before he died ... we saw one another, and at first I thought he was passing on, but he stopped and called out, &#x27;Ah Wilberforce, how do you do?&#x27; And gave me a hearty shake by the hand. I would have given a thousand pounds for that shake. I never saw him afterwards.&quot;

=== Key positions in government ===
From June 1793, Dundas was appointed President of the Board of Control, generally responsible for overseeing the conduct of the East India Company and British affairs in India, a post he would hold until 1801. As the effective Minister for War as part of his Home Department responsibilities at the outbreak of the Wars of the French Revolution, he was Pitt&#x27;s closest advisor and planner for Britain&#x27;s military participation in the First Coalition. Although Dundas was replaced as Home Secretary by the Duke of Portland in July 1794, Pitt nonetheless wished to maintain direction of the war effort in Dundas&#x27;s trusted hands, and so created for him the new office of Secretary of State for War. During the period Dundas also effectively led much of Britain&#x27;s domestic and foreign intelligence activities, directly receiving reports from foreign and domestic agents, initiating paramilitary operations, and sponsoring propaganda. Dundas was responsible for organising several British expeditions to the Caribbean to seize vulnerable French and Spanish possessions, the largest being that led by Sir Ralph Abercromy in 1795–6. Dundas spearheaded a vain attempt by the British to capture Saint-Domingue from the French during the Haitian Revolution. After they lost territory to the armies of Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture, and became bogged down in their retreat to the western towns of Mole St Nicholas and Jérémie in Saint-Domingue, the British accepted they could not defeat the armies of black ex-slaves, and negotiated to withdraw from the island, resulting in thousands of British deaths for no gain.

Dundas also presided over a crisis in Britain&#x27;s most important possession, the Colony of Jamaica. General George Walpole secured the surrender of the Jamaican Maroons of Cudjoe&#x27;s Town (Trelawny Town), on condition they would not be transported off the island. The governor of Jamaica, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, used a contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport most of the Trelawny Town Maroons to Nova Scotia. Walpole was disgusted with the governor&#x27;s actions, pointing out that he had given the Maroons his word that they would not be transported off the island. Walpole resigned his commission, and went back to England, where he became an MP and protested in vain in the House of Commons how Balcarres had behaved in a duplicitous and dishonest way with the Maroons. Dundas sided with Balcarres in the dispute, and turned down Walpole&#x27;s requests to get the Maroons returned to Jamaica.

Dundas was a vigorous advocate of a strong British presence in the Mediterranean. He promptly met the challenge of Napoleon&#x27;s attack on Egypt with actions which were vigorous and pivotal. While he did not prevent the French landing, he did play a key role in defeating it, thus enhancing British security in India.

From about 1798 on he pleaded frequently to be allowed to resign from his offices on health grounds, but Pitt, who relied on him greatly, refused even to consider it. Pitt&#x27;s ministry left office in 1801. In 1802, Dundas was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Viscount Melville and Baron Dunira, of Dunira in Perthshire. When Pitt returned to power in 1804, Dundas again entered office as First Lord of the Admiralty. Suspicion had arisen, however, as to the financial management of the Admiralty, of which Dundas had been treasurer between 1782 and 1800.

=== Commission of Inquiry ===
In 1802 the Commissioners of Naval Inquiry commenced inquiries into embezzlement of public funds 20 years earlier, when Dundas was treasurer of the Navy. Its report was presented in 1805. The Navy&#x27;s paymaster, Alexander Trotter, admitted to the Commissioners that he had transferred public money from the Bank of England to his own credit in a private account at Coutts Bank, investing and loaning the funds at interest, from which he benefited. Although his transactions caused no loss of public money, but rather the loss of interest on that money, impeachment proceedings were taken against Dundas in 1806, given that the misappropriation had occurred during his term as Treasurer of the Navy. The trial, in the House of Lords, attracted considerable notice because of &quot;dislike of patronage and the Pittite &#x27;system&#x27;, anti-Scottish bias, and advocacy of financial and parliamentary reform&quot;. The process ended in Dundas&#x27;s acquittal.

Dundas had already left the Privy Council in 1805 but he remained in the House of Lords. He was readmitted to the Privy Council in 1807. He declined an offer of an earldom in 1809.

==Family==


Lord Melville&#x27;s first marriage was to Elizabeth Rannie, daughter of David Rannie, of Melville Castle, in 1765. She is believed to have been about 16 at the time of the marriage, although the date of her birth is not certain. She committed adultery (then known as &quot;criminal conversation&quot;) with a Captain Everard Faukener in 1778, after 13 years of marriage, and abandoned Dundas and their four children, fleeing to an undisclosed location. Within days she confessed in a letter to Dundas, saying she was &quot;undeserving of being your wife or the mother to your unhappy children.&quot; Approximately a month later they were divorced. She went on to marry Faukener and never saw her children again. Henry Dundas became the owner of the family patrimony she brought to the marriage, in accordance with the law of the time, and raised their four children at Melville Castle near Edinburgh. Dundas paid Elizabeth a monthly annuity until his death, which was not required by law. Their eldest son Robert inherited the estate in 1811. Robert, the 2nd Viscount Melville, continued the annuity until Elizabeth&#x27;s death at the age of 98.

Between 1785 and 1806, Dundas leased a large country home called Warren House on the edge of Wimbledon Common, where his guests included George III, economist Adam Smith, abolitionist William Wilberforce, and Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. After his divorce Dundas was married again, to Lady Jane Hope, daughter of John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun, in 1793. He died in May 1811, in Edinburgh, aged 69, and was succeeded in his titles by his son from his first marriage, Robert. The Viscountess Melville later married Thomas Wallace, 1st Baron Wallace, and died in June 1829.

Dundas is buried in a family vault in Old Lasswade Kirkyard. His most famous family member is actor Kit Harington.

==Legacy and memory==

Late in life Dundas&#x27;s health suffered and he was financially distressed. He attended debates in the House of Lords and maintained his position as a member of Privy Council, but kept a lower public profile. However at his death the immediate reaction was one of widespread praise from most quarters (apart from the Whigs in Scotland). By 1900, however, historians were harsh, denouncing him as the epitome of corruption and oppression who had sold out Scotland to the English. By the late 20th century his reputation had been restored. He was praised for his military policies, for giving Scotland a cohesive government, and for making it a major player in imperial affairs.

Dundas was a friend of John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, who named a military road through Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) after him. In the city of Toronto, Yonge–Dundas Square is a prominent landmark and commercial centre, while Dundas Street is a main thoroughfare.

Dundas County, Ontario, and other highways and streets outside of Toronto, also bear his name. 

Dundas Island off the coast of British Columbia was named by Captain George Vancouver in Dundas&#x27;s honour. Vancouver originally believed it to be one island, Dundas&#x27;s Island, but it was later determined that it was in fact a small archipelago. The group became known as the Dundas Islands, while constituent islands were given the names Melville Island, Baron Island, and Dunira Island, in respect of Dundas&#x27;s titles.

The District of Dundas in New South Wales was named after the Colonial Secretary, Henry Dundas. The District of Dundas was abolished in 1889 although the name still survives in the Sydney suburb of Dundas.

In 1848, John Septimus Roe, the government surveyor (in the then colony of Western Australia), was searching for pastoral land and discovered the area around Norseman which he named Dundas Hills, after the colonial secretary. Gold was discovered there in 1893, the Dundas Field was proclaimed, and the town of Dundas established (ca. 40 km south of Norseman, later abandoned), which eventually led to the present Shire of Dundas.

A monument to Dundas, modeled loosely on Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome, stands in the centre of St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. The cost of the Melville Monument was &quot;met by contributions from officers and men of the Royal Navy.&quot; It was designed in 1821 by William Burn, who was advised by Robert Stevenson after residents of the square expressed concern about the adequacy of the foundations to support a column of such height. It cost £8,000. The garden surrounding the Melville Monument was opened to the public in 2008. A statue of Dundas, sculpted by Robert Forrest from a model by Francis Chantrey, was added to the top in 1828. The long-time headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland, directly to the east, is Dundas House; construction was completed in 1774 for Sir Lawrence Dundas, a relative. In July 2020 temporary signs were erected by the City of Edinburgh Council to note that the plaque would be updated to note Dundas&#x27;s role in delaying the abolition of slavery.

A statue (1818), by Sir Francis Chantrey, of Dundas stands against the north wall inside Parliament Hall in Edinburgh. Furthermore, the Melville Monument, an obelisk erected in 1812 on Dunmore hill, overlooking the scenic village of Comrie in Perthshire, commemorates his life.

Dundas Street, Hong Kong, was also named for him.

Bonnyrigg Rose Football Club, in the Scottish Second Division have named their new stadium New Dundas Park, in honour of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville whose wife lived locally at Melville Castle, and who was a keen supporter of &quot;the Rose&quot;.

Dundas Marsh Crown Game Preserve was created in 1927 in Cootes Paradise within what is now in Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario).

Namesake of Melville Island in Nova Scotia.

== Dispute over Dundas&#x27;s impact on abolition ==

=== Academic discourse ===
In the 20th century, historians were divided over whether Dundas should be held solely responsible for prolonging the slave trade. Historians of the slave trade and the abolitionist movement, including David Brion Davis, Roger Anstey, Robin Blackburn, and Stephen Tomkins commented that Dundas&#x27;s actions delayed rather than facilitated abolition. According to Davis, &quot;By making the abolition of the slave trade dependent on colonial reforms, Dundas suggested possibilities for indefinite delay.&quot; Stephen Mullen, a research associate at Glasgow University, called Dundas &quot;a great delayer&quot; of abolition in 2021. These claims were criticized by historian Angela McCarthy, who rejected the notion that Dundas&#x27;s actions were so singularly determinative of the course of events.

Other historians of British history argue that delay was inevitable. Angela McCarthy notes that the revolutionary wars with France, and opposition in the House of Lords and in the royal family, presented enormous obstacles. Sir Tom Devine, whose publications include editing &quot;Recovering Scotland&#x27;s Slavery Past: The Caribbean Connection&quot; (Edinburgh University Press, 2015), has said that blaming Dundas solely for delay in the abolition of the slave trade ignores the wider political and economic factors that were the true causes of delay. In another &quot;Scottish Affairs&quot; article, McCarthy held that leading anti-Dundas activist Professor Emeritus Sir Geoff Palmer repeatedly misrepresented published sources. Brian Young notes that in 1792, the motion for immediate cessation of the slave trade was heading for certain defeat. By inserting the word &quot;gradual&quot; into the motion, Young says Dundas ensured a successful vote for the ultimate abolition of the trade in slaves.

=== Controversy over legacy ===
Given accusations that he contributed to delay in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade during the 1790s, activists have argued against the memorialisation of Dundas.

Over 14,000 people signed an online petition in June 2020 to rename Dundas Street, a major street in downtown Toronto. The petition arose from a Black Lives Matter protest on 5 June 2020, where Dundas Street was the site of the march. The protest was documented by Mark Terry in the film &quot;Scotland, Slavery, and Statues.&quot; In July 2021, Toronto City Council voted to rename the street and other civic assets, although the change is still pending. In December 2023, Toronto City Council approved &quot;Sankofa Square&quot; as the new name for Yonge–Dundas Square. 

In Edinburgh, demonstrators graffitied the Melville Monument in June 2020. In March 2021, the City of Edinburgh Council approved a permanent plaque dedicated to the memory of enslaved Africans. Numerous historians, including Scotland&#x27;s most eminent historian Professor Emeritus Sir Tom Devine, as well as descendants of Dundas, criticised the content of the plaque as historically inaccurate.

== Fictional references ==
Lord Melville, as First Lord of the Admiralty, is present or a background character in several of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin novels. As a major official favourably disposed to Jack Aubrey, Lord Melville&#x27;s political interest is often helpful to the captain. O&#x27;Brian casts Melville&#x27;s impeachment for malversation of public monies as a political attack using naval intelligence spending, the details of which cannot be disclosed for security and the safety of intelligence agents—such as Stephen Maturin. Additionally, Heneage &#x27;Hen&#x27; Dundas, a real-life naval officer son of Thomas Dundas, appears as a son of the 1st Lord Melville. As a former crewmate and close friend of one of the eponymous main characters, Jack Aubrey, Heneage Dundas is one of the recurring characters of the series.

He is also a supporting character in the legal drama &quot;Garrow&#x27;s Law&quot;. As a leading figure of the establishment, he is a bitter enemy of the radical hero, William Garrow. He is played by Stephen Boxer. Also, fictional references were made to Sir Henry Dundas in Chapter 24 of L. A. Meyer&#x27;s third book in the &quot;Jacky Faber&quot; series, which was titled &quot;Under the Jolly Roger&quot; as well as the former Lord Dundas in Meyer&#x27;s sixth book, which was titled, &quot;My Bonny Light Horseman&quot;. He was portrayed as &#x27;bookish&#x27;, although a sweet and sincere man otherwise. A reference was made to Henry Dundas and his role in the abolition of the slave trade in the motion picture &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (2006) where he was played by Bill Paterson.

Dundas is also featured in &quot;Joseph Knight&quot;, by James Robertson (Fourth Estate, 2003) – a fictional account of the true story of the former slave for whom Dundas successfully appealed to two levels of Scottish courts, ultimately winning a declaration of Knight&#x27;s emancipation, and the emancipation of all purported slaves on Scottish soil.

<text>The grey fantail (Rhipidura albiscapa) is a small insectivorous bird. There is no sexual dimorphism. It is a common fantail found in Australia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. The species is considered by many to be conspecific with the New Zealand fantail (&quot;Rhipidura fuliginosa&quot;); however, differences in its calls lead some authorities to treat it as a separate species. The studies of grey fantail in 1999 by Richard Schodde and Ian Mason recommended that Tasmanian grey fantail was formally classified as &quot;R. albiscapa&quot; and New Zealand fantails populations as &quot;R. fuliginosa&quot;

==Description==

This species is mid-to-dark grey or grey-brown above, lighter (often yellowish/orange) below, with a white throat, white markings over the eye, and with (depending on the race) either white-edged or entirely white outer tail feathers. It grows to in length, of which half is the tail, which, as the name implies, is often displayed fanned out. This reveals that the outer tail feathers are light and the centre ones are dark. Some races, such as &quot;keasti&quot;, have a darker plumage.

This species is easily seen while walking in eucalypt forest, rainforest, mangroves, heath, and wooded habitat. During waking hours, they are almost never still. They flit from perch to perch, sometimes on the ground but mostly on the twigs of a tree or any other convenient object, looking out for flying insects. They are able to catch flying insects using intricate acrobatic chases. The birds are not shy, and will often flit within a few metres of people, especially in forested areas and suburban gardens. In doing so, it is able to catch any small flying insects that may have been disturbed by human activities such as walking or digging. The bird&#x27;s call is an almost metallic &quot;cheek&quot;, either as a single sound or (more often) repeated as a chattering.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Genetics ===
The populations of Australian fantails are complex and they were all formerly considered conspecific due to their being closely related based on their song, habitat, tail coloration, and clutch size. A recent study shows that &quot;R.fuliginosa&quot; in New Zealand and Australian &quot;R.albiscapa&quot; were sister taxa and another fantail species, named &quot;R.phasiana&quot; in the north coast of Australia, was sister to these two fantail species. Besides, within this subgroup &quot;R. albiscapa&quot; from Vanuatu and Australia were paraphyletic. Hence, &quot;R. albiscapa&quot; was found to be polyphyletic.

=== Geographically isolated units ===
Numerous birds of southern Australia are characterised by a known biogeographical barrier, the Nullarbor Plain, displaying morphological divergence of subspecies differentiation. Because of the east-west division due to the geographic barrier effect on their morphological divergence, the populations of R. albiscapa could be classified into five subspecies by their characteristics, such as their calls, patterns of plumage, and nest construction.

Five subpopulations of &quot;R. albiscapa&quot; are shown below:

&quot;Rhipidura albiscapa keasti (eastern Australia)&quot;

&quot;Rhipidura albiscapa albicauda (Inland western Australia)&quot;

&quot;Rhipidura albiscapa preissi (South western Australia)&quot;

&quot;Rhipidura albiscapa alisteri (eastern Australia)&quot;

&quot;Rhipidura albiscapa albiscapa (Tasmania)&quot;

==Life cycle==

=== Nesting ===
Most bird species typically build one nest, whereas grey fantails commonly build more than one nest before egg-laying, and seven nests have been recorded as the highest number in a breeding season. In a recent study, there is a hypothesis explaining nest abandonment in this species. Abandoned nests could be used for confusing predators. In fact, a large number of abandoned nests exposed on trees are significantly less concealed than nests that eventually received eggs. However, these abandoned nests were incompletely built, probably in response to the attention of predators (such as pied currawongs), because these predators may destroy incomplete nests when looking for eggs. In addition, pied currawongs are larger than grey fantails, which presents a considerable risk for adult grey fantails. Therefore, desertion might be an adaptation of grey fantails, with these nests used for eliminating hazards from cryptic predation. Some of the materials from decoy nests could be used to construct the subsequent breeding nest. The location of the breeding nest varies during the nest-building phase, ensuring a site with sufficient security to prepare for breeding. The parent birds build compact, cup-shaped nests, usually in the forks of trees, made from moss, bark and fibre, and often completed with spider&#x27;s web. According to the records of the sizes of the nests by Richard and Donaghey, which were observed in three regions of southern Australia, the average size of nests were 5.7 cm (5.1-6.4 cm) external diameter, 4.1 cm (3.8-4.4 cm) internal diameter, and 2.9 cm (2.5-3.2 cm) internal depth.

=== Breeding ===
The grey fantail is territorial and it is a seasonal breeder. They raise several broods per season, usually each of three or four cream eggs, spotted grey and brown. The incubation period is around two weeks, with incubation and feeding duties shared by both parents. During the breeding season, the mass of testes of male grey fantails grows larger than in the non-breeding season. The growth of testes sizes could be subject to sperm competition, similar to other species exhibiting morphological traits. Male birds also have pronounced cloacal protuberances. This change of morphology is associated with polygynandry and the increase in copulation chance. Despite most grey fantails forming season-long monogamous pairs, a small number of male birds seeking extra-pair copulation have been recorded. To seek extra-pair copulation, the male bird invades neighbouring territories and waits at the nest where the female birds were not incubating. The intruding male might coerce a resident female into accepting extra-pair male copulation. Moreover, the aggression of the male bird could act as a deterrent to the female bird, leading to delayed ovulation, allowing the male to re-mate. This increases the likelihood of the male becoming the sole fertiliser of that female&#x27;s eggs.

=== Migration ===
The southeastern populations of &quot;R. albiscapa&quot; in Australia and Tasmania are migratory. The southwestern subspecies R. &quot;a&quot; .&quot;preissi&quot; is mostly resident while the Queensland subspecies &quot;R. a. keasti&quot; is resident. &quot;R. a. alisteri&quot; migrates north and west in autumn, returning in spring. &quot;R. a. albicauda&quot; is an inland nomad. The subpopulation of &quot;R. a. albiscapa&quot; breeds mainly in Tasmania. When winter comes, they migrate to New South Wales and form groups with other sub-populations of &quot;R. a. alisteri&quot;. 

A small number of &quot;R. a. preissi&quot; individuals (a subspecies recognized in southwestern Australia) have also been recorded in the subpopulation of &quot;R. a. keasti&quot; and &quot;R. a. alisteri.&quot;

<text>Charles Alfred Stothard (5 July 1786 – 28 May 1821) was an English antiquarian draughtsman, with a special interest in monumental effigies.

== Life ==
Stothard was born in London, the son of the painter, Thomas Stothard. He was educated at a school run by a Mr Dearne, and then became a private pupil of the Rev Robert Burnside. He studied at the Royal Academy from 1807, and began his first historical picture, the &quot;Death of Richard II in Pomfret Castle&quot; three years later. His depiction of the king was based closely on the effigy on his tomb in Westminster Abbey.

He soon abandoned the historical painting for a project which he hoped would be more remunerative, &quot;The Monumental Effigies of Great Britain&quot;. He published the first part in 1811; an accompanying advertisement explained that its purpose was to supply historical painters with accurate details of costume up to the reign of Henry VIII, to illustrate history and biography, and to provide accurate information on dress for productions of the plays of Shakespeare. During 1815 he travelled Britain making drawings for Daniel Lysons&#x27; &quot;Magna Britannica&quot;. In that year he was appointed historical draughtsman to the Society of Antiquaries, who sent him to Bayeux to make coloured drawings of the tapestry for publication in the series &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;. He made three visits to Northern France in 1816–19 for this project. On the first of these he also discovered the location of the monuments of the Plantagenets, which had been moved when the chapel at the abbey of Fontevraud in which they were housed was demolished during the French Revolution, and made accurate drawings of them. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1819.

He made copies of the medieval paintings discovered in the chamber of the House of Lords, and prepared a paper discussing their date. He visited the Netherlands in September 1820, and early the next year prepared the eleventh part of the &quot;Monumental Effigies&quot;, finished a large plate of the effigies from Fontevraud and began a work on seals.

In February 1818, he married Anna Eliza Kempe, who accompanied him when they travelled to France that year. She retained many of his drawings after his death and left them to the British Museum after her own death, in 1883. They had one child, a daughter, who only survived her father by a year.

== Death and burial ==
In May 1821 he went to Devon to make drawings for Daniel and Samuel Lysons&#x27; history of Devon, &quot;Magna Britannia&quot;, vol. 6, &quot;Devonshire&quot;, published in 1822. He died on the 28 May, falling from a ladder while tracing a portrait from one of the windows in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bere Ferrers. His grave is at Bere Ferrers. A later antiquarian, W. H. Hamilton Rogers, who also made studies of the Ferrers family in the same church, wrote 70 years later:

The &quot;founder of these courts below&quot; was Sir William Ferrers, founder of Bere Ferrers church, whose image appears in the stained glass window Stothard was drawing at the time of his death.

== Publications ==
Stothard&#x27;s principal publication was &quot;The Monumental Effigies of Great Britain; selected from our cathedrals and churches for the purpose of bringing together, and preserving correct representations of the best historical illustrations extant, from the Norman Conquest to the reign of Henry the Eighth&quot;, a folio volume containing many etched plates. He began to issue it in parts in 1811, but it remained unfinished at his death. His widow, Anna Eliza, brought it to completion, with the assistance of four different etchers (who produced the remaining plates from Stothard&#x27;s original drawings), and her brother, Alfred John Kempe (who provided additional text, based in part on Stothard&#x27;s own notes). The complete volume finally appeared in 1832, although it contains two title pages, one dated 1817 and the other 1832, which has sometimes caused bibliographical confusion. The focus of the published work is firmly on effigies, but Phillip Lindley has shown that this was a consequence of Stothard&#x27;s premature death, and that his intention was to record more of their monumental and architectural contexts.

A second edition of &quot;Monumental Effigies&quot;, in two folio volumes and with further additional text by John Hewitt, was published in 1876. A facsimile edition of the first edition, at a slightly reduced size, was issued by Ken Trotman Publishing in 2011.
Engravings from Stothard&#x27;s drawings of the Bayeux Tapestry were made by James Basire, and published in 1823. They show the complete tapestry, and were described by the art historian Eric Maclagan as &quot;exquisite plates [which] still provide what is in many ways the most adequate representation of the original&quot;.

Anna Eliza also published her &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Stothard, incorporating many journal entries, letters, and other original documents, in 1823. The book did much to mould and enhance his posthumous reputation.

<text>Thomas Stothard (17 August 1755 – 27 April 1834) was a British painter, illustrator and engraver.
His son, Robert T. Stothard was a painter (fl. 1810): he painted the proclamation outside York Minster of Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession to the throne in June 1837.
==Early life==
Stothard was born in London, the son of a well-to-do innkeeper in Long Acre. A delicate child, he was sent at the age of five to a relative in Yorkshire, and attended school at Acomb, and afterwards at Tadcaster and at Ilford, Essex. Showing talent for drawing, he was apprenticed to a draughtsman of patterns for brocaded silks in Spitalfields. In his spare time, he attempted illustrations for the works of his favourite poets. Some of these drawings were praised by James Harrison, the editor of the &quot;Novelist&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Stothard&#x27;s master having died, he resolved to devote himself to art.

==Career==
In 1778 Stothard became a student of the Royal Academy, of which he was elected associate in 1792 and full academician in 1794. In 1812 he was appointed librarian to the Academy after serving as assistant for two years. Among his earliest book illustrations are plates engraved for &quot;Ossian&quot; and for Bell&#x27;s &quot;Poets&quot;. In 1780, he became a regular contributor to the &quot;Novelist&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, for which he produced 148 designs, including his eleven illustrations to &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot; (by Tobias Smollett) and his graceful subjects from &quot;Clarissa&quot; and &quot;The History of Sir Charles Grandison&quot; (both by Samuel Richardson).

From 1786, Thomas Fielding, a friend of Stothard&#x27;s and engraver, produced engravings using designs by Stothard, Angelika Kauffmann, and of his own. Arcadian scenes were especially esteemed. Fielding realised these in colour, using copper engraving, and achieved excellent quality. Stothard&#x27;s designs had an exceptional aesthetic appeal.

He designed plates for pocket-books, tickets for concerts, illustrations to almanacs, and portraits of popular actors. These are popular with collectors for their grace and distinction. His more important works include illustrations for:
* Two sets for Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, one for the &quot;New Magazine&quot; and one for Stockdale&#x27;s edition
* John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1788)
* Harding&#x27;s edition of Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1792)
* Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (1798)
* The works of the Swiss poet Salomon Gessner (1802)
* William Cowper&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (1825)
* Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;
His figure-subjects in Samuel Rogers&#x27;s &quot;Italy&quot; (1830) and &quot;Poems&quot; (1834) demonstrate that even in old age, his imagination remained fertile and his hand firm.

Art historian Ralph Nicholson Wornum estimated that Stothard&#x27;s designs number five thousand and, of these, about three thousand were engraved. His oil pictures are usually small. His colouring is often rich and glowing in the style of Rubens, whom Stothard admired. The &quot;Vintage&quot;, perhaps his most important oil painting, is in the National Gallery. He contributed to John Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery, but his best-known painting is the &quot;Procession of the Canterbury Pilgrims&quot;, in Tate Britain, the engraving from which, begun by Luigi and continued by Niccolo Schiavonetti and finished by James Heath, was immensely popular. The commission for this picture was given to Stothard by Robert Hartley Cromek, and was the cause of a quarrel with his friend William Blake. It was followed by a companion work, the &quot;Flitch of Bacon&quot;, which was drawn in sepia for the engraver but was never carried out in colour.


In addition to his easel pictures, Stothard decorated the grand staircase of Burghley House, near Stamford in Lincolnshire, with subjects of &quot;War&quot;, &quot;Intemperance&quot;, and the &quot;Descent of Orpheus in Hell&quot; (1799–1803); the library of Colonel Johnes&#x27; mansion of Hafod, in North Wales, with a series of scenes from Froissart and Monstrelet painted in imitation of relief (1810); and the cupola of the upper hall of the Advocates&#x27; Library, Edinburgh (later occupied by the Signet Library), with Apollo and the Muses, and figures of poets, orators, etc. (1822). He prepared designs for a frieze and other sculptural decorations for Buckingham Palace, which were not executed, owing to the death of George IV. He also designed a shield presented to the Duke of Wellington by the merchants of London, and executed a series of eight etchings from the various subjects that adorned it.

==Personal life==
Stothard married Rebecca Watkins (d. 1825) in 1783. They had eleven children, of whom six – five sons and one daughter – survived infancy. They lived in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, until 1794, when they moved to a house at 28 Newman Street, Fitzrovia of which Stothard had bought the freehold. His wife died in 1825. His sons included Thomas, accidentally shot dead in about 1801; the antiquarian illustrator Charles Alfred Stothard, who also predeceased his father; and Alfred Joseph Stothard, medallist to George IV.

Stothard died on 27 April 1834, and was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground in north London.

==In literature==
Stothard&#x27;s painting of &quot;Erato&quot; (one of the Muses) is given a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in her &quot;Poetical Catalogue of Pictures&quot;, in the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; (1823). Another of his paintings, &quot;The Fairy Queen Sleeping&quot;, is poetically examined in a similar fashion in her &quot;Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures&quot; in &quot;The Troubadour&quot; (1826).

<doc id="220583" wikidata="Q1269370" url="?curid=220583" title="History of the United States (1776–1789)">
<text>The history of the United States from 1776 to 1789 was marked by the nation&#x27;s transition from the American Revolutionary War to the establishment of a novel constitutional order.

As a result of the American Revolution, the thirteen British colonies emerged as a newly independent nation, the United States of America, between 1776 and 1789. Fighting in the American Revolutionary War started between colonial militias and the British Army in 1775. The Second Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781 to form the Congress of the Confederation. Under the leadership of General George Washington, the Continental Army and Navy defeated the British military, securing the independence of the Thirteen Colonies. The Confederation period continued until 1789, when the states replaced the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution of the United States, which remains the fundamental governing law of the United States.

The 1780s marked an economic downturn for the United States due to debts incurred during the Revolutionary War, Congress&#x27; inability to levy taxes, and significant inflation of the Continental dollar. Political essays such as &quot;Common Sense&quot; and &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; had a major effect on American culture and public opinion. The Northwest Territory was created as the first federal territory in 1787, and a border dispute in this region prompted raids that escalated into the Northwest Indian War. The Revolution and the Confederation period are placed within the American Enlightenment, a period in which Age of Enlightenment ideas grew popular and prompted scientific advancement.

==Background==

During the 17th and 18th centuries, British colonies in America were given considerable autonomy under the system of salutary neglect. This autonomy was challenged in the 1760s by several acts of the Grenville ministry, including the Stamp Act 1765 and the Quartering Acts. These acts provoked an ideological conflict between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies regarding the nature of the Crown&#x27;s authority over colonists. Protests by the colonists began as a demand for equal rights under the British constitution, but as the dispute progressed, they took a decidedly republican political viewpoint.

From the Stamp Act of 1765 onward, disputes with London escalated. Committees of correspondence were formed between 1770 and 1773 to organize colonists that opposed British authority. Riots occurred in opposition to British taxation on tea, culminating in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773, that saw dozens of men dumping massive amounts of British tea into the Boston Harbor. Great Britain responded with the even more controversial Intolerable Acts that enforced penalties on the colonies, and on Massachusetts in particular. This prompted the colonists to convene the First Continental Congress on September 5, 1774, as a unified body to oppose British authority. The American Revolutionary War began on April 19, 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord.

The Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the aftermath of armed clashes in April. With all thirteen colonies represented, it immediately began to organize itself as a central government with control over the diplomacy and instructed the colonies to write constitutions for themselves as states. In June 1775, George Washington, a charismatic Virginia political leader with combat experience, was unanimously appointed commander of a newly organized Continental Army. The Boston campaign continued with the Continental Army besieging British-occupied Boston until the British retreated to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1776. The Invasion of Quebec in the northeast and southwest was also carried out by the Continental Army in the 1770s.

==American Revolution==
=== Declaration of Independence ===
On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, voted unanimously to declare independence as the &quot;United States of America&quot;. Two days later, on July 4, Congress signed the Declaration of Independence. The Second Continental Congress was not initially formed to declare independence. Support for independence had grown gradually in 1775 and 1776 as Great Britain refused the colonists&#x27; demands and hostilities became more pronounced. The political pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; further popularized support for independence. In May 1776, the Continental Congress recommended that the colonies establish their own governments independently of Great Britain.

The drafting of the Declaration was the responsibility of a Committee of Five, which included John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Benjamin Franklin; it was drafted by Jefferson and revised by the others and the Congress as a whole. It contended that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; with &quot;certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, and that &quot;to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed&quot;, as well as listing the main colonial grievances against the crown. Jefferson expressed that he did not wish to create new arguments, but rather to present those of previous philosophers, such as those of John Locke. Filippo Mazzei, an Italian physician and promoter of liberty, was a close friend and confidant of Thomas Jefferson. In 1774 he published a pamphlet containing the phrase, which Jefferson incorporated essentially intact into the Declaration of Independence: &quot;All men are by nature equally free and independent&quot;.

The signers of the Declaration of Independence were highly educated and wealthy, and they came from the older colonial settlements. They were largely Protestant and of British descent. In the following century, the signing of the Declaration of Independence would be commemorated as Independence Day.

=== American Revolutionary War ===

==== Northern theater (1776–1777) ====
The task of organizing the Continental Army fell to General Washington, and the Second Continental Congress oversaw military action through war boards. At the onset of the war, the army had little equipment or formal training. Washington assigned Prussian Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to train the army, and the baron&#x27;s military experience produced a strong military for the United States. To supply the army, Washington pressured Congress for additional supplies, but funding from each state was not compulsory and there was never a sufficient amount.

The New York and New Jersey campaign began in July 1776 as British reinforcements landed in New York City. The British counteroffensive won the Battle of Long Island, and subsequent battles resulted in alternating American and British victories. The Continental Army was routed to New Jersey, and the British army failed to take control of New England. The campaign shifted to Washington&#x27;s favor after he led a crossing of the Delaware River that resulted in a victory in the Battle of Trenton, followed immediately by another victory in the Battle of Princeton, boosting American morale.

In early 1777, a grand British strategic plan, the Saratoga campaign, was drafted in London. The plan called for two British armies to converge on Albany, New York from the north and south, dividing the colonies in two and separating New England from the rest. General John Burgoyne led British soldiers from Montreal in June 1777, engaging in skirmishes with American forces. American General Horatio Gates was appointed as Northern Army commander. The forces of Burgoyne and Gates fought in the Saratoga campaign, with the British forces surrendering after the Second Battle of Saratoga. The forces of British commander William Howe were supposed to provide reinforcements from the south, but he instead engaged in the Philadelphia campaign, taking the capital city of Philadelphia.

The American victory at Saratoga led the French into a military alliance with the United States through the Treaty of Alliance in 1778. France was soon joined by Spain and the Netherlands, both major naval powers with an interest in undermining British strength. Britain now faced a major European war, and the involvement of the French navy neutralized their previous dominance of the war on the sea. Britain was without allies and faced the prospect of invasion across the English Channel.

==== Western theater (1776–1782) ====

Throughout the Revolutionary War, smaller battles and ambushes were fought west of the Appalachian Mountains along the southwestern area of Canada and in American territories. Fearing the expansion of the United States and encouraged by the British, several Native American tribes launched attacks against Americans. Battles and massacres took place between the Continental Army and Native American fighters as well as against non-combatants and farms. In the final years of the war, Great Britain stopped providing much of its support for Native American tribes, and the United States won in the western theater with strict terms of surrender.

==== Southern theater (1778–1781) ====
Except for an attempt to take Charleston in 1776, Great Britain did not attack the southern states of Georgia or South Carolina in the early years of the war. Most fighting in the South had been carried out by the Cherokee. Following the failure at Saratoga, however, Great Britain moved its focus to the South, and the Capture of Savannah occurred in 1778. The United States had not been prepared for a campaign in the South, and American General Benjamin Lincoln was appointed to the South to raise a militia. The Siege of Charleston took place in 1780, and the British captured this city as well. North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia had higher Loyalist populations than other states, further contributing to British victories in the southern theater. After the Siege of Charleston, British General Lord Cornwallis took charge of the British forces in the Southern United States. Victory in the Battle of Camden in 1780 reiterated British control over the South.

Cornwallis advanced his forces into North Carolina, depending on Loyalists to join his forces as he went, but few joined him. General Nathanael Greene routed the British forces, preventing them from taking North Carolina. Against his instructions to defend the occupied South, Cornwallis moved his forces north to Virginia. Greene&#x27;s forces moved south and reclaimed Georgia and South Carolina. Cornwallis positioned his forces in Yorktown, Virginia in hope of defeating the forces of the French General Lafayette. The French navy prevented the British navy from providing assistance in the Battle of the Chesapeake, and Washington and Lafayette&#x27;s forces laid siege to Yorktown. Cornwallis surrendered on October 19, 1781, effectively ending the American Revolutionary War. King George III and Prime Minister Lord North wished to mount another campaign, but Parliament overruled them, forbidding any further conflict.

=== Treaty of Paris ===

King George III formally acknowledged American independence and ordered the end of hostilities on December 5, 1782. Peace negotiations took place in Paris, with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay representing the United States. Negotiations concluded with the Treaty of Paris, which legally recognized the United States as an independent country. Great Britain agreed to give up portions of southwestern Canada, though the boundary with the rest of British Canada remained unsettled. Some elements of the treaty were controversial among Americans, including those that recognized the monetary debts owed to Loyalists and those that critics felt challenged the status of each state government as a sovereign entity.

On November 25, 1783, George Washington led a procession through New York City on horseback as the final British soldiers boarded their boats to leave the harbor. Victory celebrations were held in the city, and the day would be remembered as Evacuation Day. On December 23, 1783, Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. The Treaty of Paris was ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784.

==Confederation period==
===Articles of Confederation===
The Articles of Confederation were proposed by the Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and they were ratified on March 1, 1781. It replaced the administrative boards and appellate courts that Congress had created during the early stages of the Revolutionary War. While the Articles of Confederation granted certain powers to the Congress of the Confederation, they also imposed restrictions that made governance difficult. These restrictions were by design, as many Americans feared that a strong central government would be too similar to the British monarchy. The powers of the central government were limited primarily to war, diplomacy, and resolving interstate disputes. It lacked powers to pass economic legislation, causing economic decline as it proved unable to pay its debts. Acts of Congress required high majorities to be passed, and amendments to the Articles required unanimous approval by the states.

Most governing was carried out by state governments during the Confederation Period. Though Pennsylvania was the only state to use official political parties, informal partisanship developed across the new nation in the 1780s. Divisions emerged over how powerful the central government should be, how debts should be managed, and how Western settlement should be carried out. The factions disagreed on how democratic the nation should be, influenced by fears of both tyranny by elites and mob rule by the masses.

The political and economic troubles caused civil conflict within the states. Mutinies occurred in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in January 1781, soldiers marched on the capital in June 1783, and a coup against General Washington was considered among military officers in Newburgh. The unrest culminated in Shays&#x27; Rebellion in the winter of 1786–1787, in which protests against the handling of debts in Massachusetts led to an armed uprising. The states declined to fund a military force, and Massachusetts was forced to fund its own state force. Though Shays&#x27; Rebellion was short-lived, it became a strong argument for those in favor of reforming the national government.

=== Foreign affairs ===

Congress oversaw foreign policy, but the states had the final say in their own foreign relations, with each state ratifying treaties individually. Relations with Great Britain were still troubled after the war. Many states did not comply with the terms of the Treaty of Paris regarding the treatment of British nationals, and the British Army maintained a presence in the western territories. Britain also hurt American trade through restrictions on American products to promote Canadian growth. The Shelburne ministry had been lenient in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris, but this proved controversial, prompting a change in government that resulted in much colder relations with the United States.

As economic conditions worsened, Congress failed to repay its debts to the countries that provided military support during the war: France, Spain, and the Netherlands. Relations with Spain were further strained by the Spanish government&#x27;s closure of the Mississippi River, which hindered American transport and trade. Despite a strong alliance during the revolution, France paid little attention to the United States during the Confederacy period. The United States also made trade agreements with the Netherlands, Sweden, and Prussia in the 1780s, but these made up a relatively small portion of American trade compared to Great Britain. In the Mediterranean Sea, American ships faced the North African Barbary pirates. As Congress had few resources to address the issue, little was done during the Confederation period to take action against the pirates. A peace negotiation was made with Morocco, but Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis continued to allow the capture of American ships.

===Constitutional Convention===

Economic conflict grew between the states as the Confederation period went on, and Congress had no power to prevent it. By 1786, many of the most prominent Americans in government were expressing concerns that the government under the Articles of Confederation was not sufficient, as it lacked both the economic and military security that had previously been provided by Great Britain. The Annapolis Convention was held in 1786 to address trade issues, but it saw meager attendance with most states failing to send a delegate. The delegates from New Jersey had been authorized wide latitude by the state, and this was used to submit a proposal for a convention to reform the government entirely. In February 1787, Congress voted to hold the convention the following May, indicating a broad loss in confidence of the governmental system under the Articles of Confederation.

While there was not a clear objective before the convention, some delegates wished to establish a new central government that would have more power than Congress did under the Articles of Confederation. James Madison became the leader of these delegates, developing the Virginia Plan that would form the basis of the Constitution of the United States. The convention began on May 25, 1787, after a sufficient number of delegates had arrived in Philadelphia. The main issue at contention was the extent of power that would be transferred from the states to the federal government. Many state delegations, particularly that of Delaware, resisted centralization for fear that it would be dominated by the larger states. Madison&#x27;s Virginia Plan competed with the New Jersey Plan of William Paterson, which opposed proportional representation in favor of equal representation. The dispute was resolved with the Connecticut Compromise, which created a bicameral legislature. The issue of slavery was also a concern, particularly in regard to whether slaves should be counted as citizens.

The final draft of the Constitution was delivered by Gouverneur Morris on September 12, 1787. Written to correct the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution established the procedures and powers relating to Congress, the presidency, the courts, and how these offices related to the states. It also allowed for future amendments, acknowledged the debts incurred under the Articles of Confederation, and set the requirements for ratification. The delegates signed the Constitution on September 17 and sent it to Congress, where it was approved and sent to the states for ratification.

=== Campaign for ratification ===

Those who advocated the Constitution took the name Federalists and quickly gained supporters throughout the nation. The most influential Federalists were Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, the anonymous authors of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, a series of 85 essays published in New York newspapers, written under the pen name &quot;Publius&quot; to sway the closely divided New York legislature. The papers have become seminal documents for the United States and have often been cited by jurists. Those who opposed the new Constitution became known as the Anti-Federalists. They were generally local rather than cosmopolitan in perspective, oriented to plantations and farms rather than commerce or finance, and wanted strong state governments and a weak national government.

Each state held a convention to vote on ratification of the Constitution. Supporters of ratification ensured that states more likely to accept the Constitution were the first to hold conventions, fearing that early rejections may dissuade other states from ratifying. Smaller states were supportive of the Constitution, as a centralized government offered a check on the power of larger states. Delaware and New Jersey ratified in 1787, and Georgia ratified on January 2, 1788, all by unanimous votes. Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, and South Carolina all ratified by large majorities over the winter and spring of 1788. It was more controversial in other states, with Massachusetts only ratifying by a narrow vote of 187–168. New Hampshire provided the final ratification that was necessary for the Constitution to go into effect on June 21, 1788. Ratification was more controversial in the larger states of New York, Virginia, and Massachusetts. Promises of a Bill of Rights from Madison secured ratification in Virginia, while in New York, the Clintons, who controlled New York politics, found themselves outmaneuvered as Hamilton secured ratification by a 30–27 vote. North Carolina and Rhode Island were the last of the 13 states to ratify, doing so after the new government had begun operation.

The United States Electoral College met on February 4, 1789, to unanimously vote for George Washington in the first presidential election. The 1st United States Congress read the results on April 6, and Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall on April 30. A Bill of Rights was approved by the new Congress in September 1789 and took effect in December 1791.

==Westward expansion==
Settlement of Trans-Appalachia grew during the Revolutionary War, increasing from a few thousand to 25,000 settlers. Westward expansion stirred enthusiasm even in those who did not move west, and many leading Americans, including Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay, purchased lands in the west. Land speculators founded groups like the Ohio Company, which acquired title to vast tracts of land in the west and often came into conflict with settlers.

From 1780 to 1784, Congress held negotiations with Virginia to cede its western territory. An agreement took effect on March 1, 1784, creating the first national territory that was not part of any state. Congress created a territorial government and set requirements for statehood with the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the Land Ordinance of 1785.

In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, which granted Congress greater control of the region by establishing the Northwest Territory. Under the new arrangement, many of the former elected officials of the territory were instead appointed by Congress. In order to attract Northern settlers, Congress outlawed slavery in the Northwest Territory, though it also passed a fugitive slave law to appease the Southern states. The Old Southwest remained under the control of the southern states, and each state claimed to extend west to the Mississippi River. In 1784, settlers in western North Carolina sought statehood as the State of Franklin, but their efforts were denied by Congress, which did not want to set a precedent regarding the secession of states.

During the Revolutionary War, Great Britain had aligned with many of the Native American tribes in its claimed territories to the west of the colonies. This was an escalation of the skirmishes that made up the American Indian Wars that had been prompted by land encroachment by colonists and raids by Native American tribes, such as the Shawnee tribes. Pioneers responded to Native American attacks against colonial civilians by in turn attacking Native American civilians. The British continued to supply arms to Native Americans after the signing of the Treaty of Paris. Between 1783 and 1787, hundreds of settlers died in low-level conflicts with Native Americans, and these conflicts discouraged further settlement. By the end of the decade, the frontier was engulfed in the Northwest Indian War against the Northwestern Confederacy. These Native Americans sought the creation of an independent Indian barrier state with the support and under protection of the British, posing a major foreign policy challenge to the United States. Though Great Britain had agreed to cede its western influence to the United States, it continued to provide weapons for the Northwestern Confederacy. As Congress provided little military support against the Native Americans, most of the fighting was done by the settlers. This war would continue until the signing of the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 that defined the boundary between the United States and the Native American tribes.

== Economy ==
The American Revolution had large scale effects on the economies of the Thirteen Colonies. The Continental Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, so it depended on the newly formed state governments to raise funds, and they were forced to raise taxes to cover war expenditures. It also caused a labor shortage as workers enlisted in the Patriot and Loyalist militaries, ending a decades-long trend of industrial expansion in the Mid-Atlantic. The workforce consisted of both free laborers and slave labor, while indentured servitude had largely fallen out of practice by the time of the American Revolution. Economic growth was further slowed by a reduction in immigration because of the war. The Bank of North America was established as the country&#x27;s first bank in 1781.

The Continental Congress created its own Continental currency banknotes to increase funding, but this currency quickly depreciated in value and did not survive to the end of the war. The lack of a centralized currency and economic policy was a major factor in the decision to hold the Constitutional Convention. The war and the inflation caused shortages for both the military and for civilians. It was common during these shortages for civilians to form crowds and ransack stores that did not offer what they considered to be fair prices. Similar issues plagued the state governments as they accumulated their own debts, though the states could impose taxes and increased them significantly as the economic crisis worsened. Early supporters of revolution also supported corporatism and price controls, but most political and economic thinkers rejected these concepts, and support grew for a democratic free market system with taxation.

The economy of the early United States was heavily agricultural, but it also involved other forms of resource extraction, such as lumber, fishing, and fur. Manufacturing was limited, though shipbuilding was a major industry. The revolution required American merchants to rebuild connections with global markets, as trade had previously been facilitated under the flag of Great Britain. The high tariffs that were common at the time limited profitability, but high demand for American goods allowed the United States to make up for the economic turmoil of the revolution. When the war ended, the Treaty of Paris allowed British creditors to call in debts from the American market, triggering a depression. The government was also in debt to France, the Netherlands, and Spain. Many states raised taxes after the war to cover the expenses that it brought, prompting unrest, including that of Shays&#x27; Rebellion.

Due to the close relation of American and British commerce, many traders renegotiated with British merchants after the war, and they facilitated American trade as they did under colonial rule. Economic policies of individual states made domestic trade more difficult, as state governments often discriminated against merchants from other states. A national deficit occurred in 1786, and it continued to increase through the Confederation period. By 1787, Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.

== Culture and media ==

A distinct American culture separate from Britain had already developed by the 1750s. A plainness in fashion and speech was common, originating from Puritan standards of the colonial era and reasserted by the revolution. The United States in the 18th century saw a proliferation of newspapers and magazine, many of which were in print only briefly. Political essays such as &quot;The American Crisis&quot;, &quot;Common Sense&quot;, and &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; were influential in shaping the early United States. Full-length books also addressed political concepts regarding the revolution, including &quot;Letters from an American Farmer&quot; by J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur and &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; by Thomas Jefferson. Social and political ideas were often expressed through poetry. Poets such as John Trumbull, Philip Freneau and Hugh Henry Brackenridge wrote of nationalist ideas about an independent United States. &quot;The Conquest of Canaan&quot; by Timothy Dwight is credited as the first epic poem of the United States. &quot;The Anarchiad&quot; was a prominent satire of the early United States. The first American novel, &quot;The Power of Sympathy&quot;, was published by William Hill Brown in 1789.

Drama and theater were controversial in the early United States. Plays had been condemned by Puritans in the colonial era, and the Continental Congress issued a formal condemnation of plays in 1774. Plays that were performed during the revolutionary era were typically European. The most prominent American dramatist during the revolutionary era was Mercy Otis Warren, whose plays included &quot;The Adulateur&quot;, &quot;The Group&quot;, and &quot;The Blockheads&quot;. Hugh Henry Brackenridge wrote two historical plays that portrayed the Revolutionary War. John Leacock wrote &quot;The Fall of British Tyranny&quot;, the first play to feature George Washington as a character. Innovations in drama declined after the Revolutionary War, in part due to the political and economic turmoil of the 1780s. William Dunlap began his prolific career as a playwright with &quot;The Father&quot; in 1789.

Visual art was influenced by the literature of European aestheticians, including Charles Alphonse du Fresnoy, Roger de Piles, Jonathan Richardson, and Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Many American artists traveled abroad to learn art, particularly to London to learn under Benjamin West. John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale were prominent painters in the first years of the United States; as supporters of republicanism, they are both known for their respective portraits of George Washington.

== Science and education ==
Historians categorize the time of the American Revolution as part of a broader American Enlightenment, in which the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment began to influence American science and philosophy. This included a shift away from religious groundings in philosophy. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were prolific philosophic writers in this regard. &quot;&quot; by Ethan Allen was an early challenge to the religious rejection of rationalism in the United States in 1784. Massachusetts formed a medical society in 1781, following the precedent set by New Jersey in 1766.

The scientific community of the early United States was centered in Philadelphia, including the American Philosophical Society. Astronomy and taxonomy were two of the most prominent scientific fields at the time, and physicians of the revolutionary era often had a scientific background beyond medicine. Benjamin Franklin developed the study of electricity in the United States and discovered many of its properties. Many prominent scientists were immigrants from other countries, particularly Great Britain, which had a much larger scientific community.

The colonial colleges already existed by the time of the American Revolution. These colleges were all male, and they were based on the ideas of education associated with the Enlightenment. State universities began to form after the end of the Revolutionary War, starting with the University of Georgia in 1785. African Americans and Native Americans were only rarely admitted to universities, though African American men in northern states sometimes formed literary societies.

== Demographics ==

The population of the Thirteen Colonies was 2.5 million in 1776. The first national census was taken in 1790, shortly after the end of the Confederation period. It found that the United States had a population of 3,929,214 residents with an average of 4.5 people per square mile. There were five cities with a population over 10,000 residents. The largest city was New York City with 33,131 residents, followed by Philadelphia, Boston, Charleston, and Baltimore.

=== Patriots and loyalists ===

During the revolutionary period, residents of the states were divided on whether to seek independence or to remain loyal to the British Empire. Those who supported revolution came to be known as Whigs or Patriots, while those favoring loyalty to Great Britain were known as Tories or Loyalists. Loyalists were more common in the southern states. Though much of the population was opposed to or neutral toward revolution in the early years of independence, the proportion of Patriots increased as the conflict progressed. Supporters of the British Empire commonly included merchants and farmers that felt they benefited from colonial rule as well as slaves that hoped loyalty to Britain would bring them freedom. It proved controversial among Patriots when compensation to Loyalists became part of the peace agreement after the Revolutionary War.

Those who fought as members of the Continental Army benefited from the revolution, as they were predominantly working-class men who were able to meaningfully influence their government for the first time. Women of the revolution similarly desired increased influence in politics, but they were restricted from meaningful participation. Historians disagree on the extent that the revolution affected women that assisted the Patriots.

=== Religion ===

Many churches and ministers took vocal stances on the American Revolution while it was ongoing. John Adams considered the Anglican church to be a means for the Parliament of Great Britain to control the colonies. Anglican clergy associated with the Loyalists, and clergy that continued the mandated prayer for the Crown were harassed or exiled. Founding Father Benjamin Rush once said that some Loyalists opposed revolution because they feared it would give power to Presbyterians. From 1775 to 1783, the number of Anglican ministers in the Thirteen Colonies decreased from 311 to 141.

The Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial, and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric. The Revolutionary War drew attention away from the Pope, making King George III the most prominent foreign opponent in the minds of Americans. Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists. By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states in which they had previously been discriminated against.

=== Slavery ===

The controversial issue of slavery was brought up during the drafting of the Declaration of Independence; Jefferson&#x27;s original draft condemned King George III for his support of the slave trade, but Southern delegates had the language removed. Virginia governor Lord Dunmore issued Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation in 1775, offering freedom to slaves that fought alongside the British. General Sir Henry Clinton made a similar proclamation in 1779. Thousands of slaves served as Black Loyalists in the Revolutionary War. Similarly, the Continental Army allowed Black men, including slaves, to serve in 1777. It also guaranteed freedom for slaves that joined the army, though Southern states worked to prevent such an offer.

The American Revolution made the issue of slavery more prominent, as some writers began to criticize what they saw as hypocrisy in supporting liberty while owning slaves, causing the institution to lose popularity in the Northern United States. Many slaves also pledged support to the Patriot cause, particularly in the north, further inclining these states to end slavery. In 1780, Pennsylvania enacted a law banning the enslavement of people born after March 1 of that year and guaranteeing freedom to children born into slavery after that date upon reaching the age of 28. Connecticut and Rhode Island ended slavery on similar terms in 1784. In other Northern states, slaves were active in both protest and litigation against slavery, and by the end of the 1780s, they successfully sued for freedom in all Northern states but New Jersey and New York.

Slaves in the Southern states, who made up a much larger proportion of the population, were not given significant liberties in light of the revolution. Changes to slavery in the South were smaller, including an end to the Atlantic slave trade in several states and the passage of laws that allowed slaveowners to free their slaves in their wills. Over the 1780s, the number of free Blacks in the South increased from roughly 4,000 to 60,000.

The issue of slavery was intensely debated during the drafting of the Constitution. Delegates at the Constitutional Convention were divided on the morality of slavery, and there was also debate about whether slaves should be counted when allocating proportional representation to each state. The dispute was resolved with the Three-fifths Compromise in which slaves would be counted as three-fifths of a person in the United States census.

<doc id="220587" wikidata="Q14705908" url="?curid=220587" title="WIFI (AM)">
<text>WIFI (1460 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Florence, New Jersey, and serving the Delaware Valley. It is owned by Ritmo Broadcasting, but operated by The Voice Radio Network. It airs a Spanish contemporary hit radio format. Its studios are on Broad Street in Trenton, New Jersey.

By day, WIFI is powered at 5,000 watts, and at night, it reduces power to 500 watts to protect other stations on 1460 AM. It uses a directional antenna at all times, from its transmitter facility on Burlington-Columbus Road in Burlington.

Programming is heard on two FM translators; W225DJ at 92.9 MHz in Burlington, and W281CL at 104.1 in Cherry Hill. Programming is also heard on WPEN-HD3 in Burlington.

==History==
===WRLB and WIFI===
The station received its construction permit on June 7, 1984, and was given the call sign WRLB. On February 1, 1992, while still not on the air, the station changed its call sign to WIFI. This call sign had been used for some 20 years on a Top 40 radio station in Philadelphia, 92.5 WIFI-FM (now WXTU). WIFI officially signed on the air in November 1992. It ran a brokered programming format under the &quot;MyWifi 1460&quot; brand.

The 1460 frequency had previously been used in Burlington County by WJJZ, a daytime-only station licensed to Mount Holly, New Jersey. Its transmitter site was on Burlington Island. Two incarnations of WJJZ operated, both losing their licenses over corporate problems, between 1963 and 1983.

===Changes in management===
In 2008, Florence Broadcasting Partners led by John Forsythe took over operations of the station under a time brokerage agreement with Real Life Broadcasting. On November 1, 2013, the operating contract between Real Life Broadcasting and Florence Broadcasting expired and was not renewed. The station was then operated by Omega Broadcasting, LLC, which programmed urban gospel music.

In 2013, WIFI became one of the first American broadcast stations to use 100% solar power for its daytime transmissions. A few years later, WIFI switched to Christian radio programming as &quot;Life Radio&quot;.

===Ritmo Broadcasting===
In November 2020, Ritmo Broadcasting began managing WIFI, with a contemporary hit radio format, branded &quot;WIFI 92.9&quot;.

Ritmo Broadcasting acquired WIFI and translator W225DJ effective March 1, 2021, at a purchase price of $275,000. On April 16, the station rebranded as &quot;Ritmo 92.9&quot;, and began playing tropical music.

On October 20, WIFI changed its format from tropical to Spanish-language adult contemporary, branded as &quot;Amor 92.9&quot;. At the same time, Ritmo Broadcasting moved the Spanish tropical formatted &quot;Ritmo 92.9&quot; over to 98.5 W253DG and 97.5 WPEN-HD3.

On March 24, 2022, at midnight, WIFI once again flipped its format, to rhythmic contemporary, and returned to its previous branding &quot;WIFI 92.9&quot;. The station launched its new website on March 25. This however was short lived, on March 29, WIFI flipped back to Spanish AC &quot;Amor 92.9&quot; for a few days, and on April 4, WIFI flipped back to rhythmic CHR. On April 11, after seven days of rhythmic CHR, WIFI went silent.

On April 21, WIFI flipped to urban contemporary as &quot;Jamz 92.9&quot;. On March 6, 2023, WIFI changed to a more CHR-oriented format of urban Top 40 music, keeping the &quot;Jamz 92.9&quot; brand.

On January 15, 2024, The Voice Radio Network agreed to acquire FM translator W281CL from Ritmo Broadcasting at a price of $90,000. The Voice Radio Network also began operating WIFI, flipping the format to Spanish CHR under The Voice Radio Network&#x27;s &quot;Maxima&quot; branding as &quot;Maxima 92.9&quot;. Later in 2024, The Voice Radio acquired WNJE to launch a second Spanish-language format (regional Mexican &quot;La Raza&quot;) in Trenton to carry on 98.5 W253DG, which operates on the same tower as W281CL.

<doc id="220589" wikidata="Q1965807" url="?curid=220589" title="Theory of imputation">
<text>The theory of imputation is based on the so-called theory of factors of production proposed by the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say and elaborated by the American economist John Bates Clark in his work &quot;The Distribution of Wealth&quot; (1899; Russian translation, 1934). The proponents of the theory of imputation see its main task as elucidating which parts of wealth may be attributed (imputed) to labor and capital, respectively.

==Principles==
In economics, the theory of imputation, first expounded by Carl Menger, maintains that factor prices are determined by output prices (i.e. the value of factors of production is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value is the value of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Friedrich von Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its first derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative, the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations:
* Industry 1: &quot;X&quot; + &quot;Y&quot; = 300
* Industry 2: 6&quot;X&quot; + &quot;Z&quot; = 900
* Industry 3: 4&quot;Y&quot; + 3&quot;Z&quot; = 1700 ⇒ &quot;X&quot; = 100, &quot;Y&quot; = 200, &quot;Z&quot; = 300.

Given that a factor is used in the production of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the &quot;least valuable&quot; good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.

That is the opposite of the labor theory of value, maintained by classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

<doc id="220595" wikidata="Q905875" url="?curid=220595" title="Dionysius Lardner">
<text>Dionysius Lardner FRS FRSE (3 April 179329 April 1859) was an Irish scientific writer who popularised science and technology, and edited the 133-volume &quot;Cabinet Cyclopædia&quot;.

== Early life in Dublin ==
He was born in Dublin on 3 April 1793 the son of William Lardner and his wife; his father was a solicitor in Dublin, who wished his son to follow the same calling. After some years of uncongenial desk work, Lardner entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1812. He obtained a B.A. in 1817 and an M.A. in 1819, winning many prizes. 

He married Cecilia Flood on 19 December 1815, but they separated in 1820 and were divorced in 1835. About the time of the separation, he began a relationship with a married woman, Anne Maria Darley Boursiquot, the wife of a Dublin wine merchant of Huguenot ancestry. It is believed that he fathered her son, Dion Boucicault, who became an actor and dramatist. Lardner provided him with financial support until 1840. Whilst in Dublin, Lardner began to write and lecture on scientific and mathematical matters, and to contribute articles for publication by the Irish Academy.

==Career in London==
In 1828, Lardner was elected professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at University College, London, a position he held until he resigned his professorship in 1831.

Lardner showed himself to be a successful populariser of science, giving talks on contemporary topics such as Babbage&#x27;s Difference Engine (1834). He was the author of numerous mathematical and physical treatises on such subjects as algebraic geometry (1823), the differential and integral calculus (1825), and the steam engine (1828). He also wrote hand-books on various departments of natural philosophy (1854–1856); but it is as the editor of Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopædia&quot; (1830–1844) that he is best remembered.

The &quot;Cabinet Cyclopædia&quot; eventually comprised 133 volumes, and many of the ablest savants of the day contributed to it. Sir Walter Scott contributed a history of Scotland and Thomas Moore contributed a history of Ireland. Connop Thirlwall provided a history of Ancient Greece, whilst Robert Southey provided a section on naval history. Many eminent scientists contributed as well. Lardner himself was the author of the treatises on arithmetic, geometry, heat, hydrostatics and pneumatics, mechanics (in conjunction with Henry Kater) and electricity (in conjunction with C.V. Walker).

The &quot;Cabinet Library&quot; (9 vols., 1830–1832), the &quot;Edinburgh Cabinet Library&quot; (38 vols., 1830–1844) and the &quot;Museum of Science and Art&quot; (12 vols., 1854–1856) were his other chief undertakings. A few original papers appear in the Royal Irish Academy&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot; (1824), in the Royal Society&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot; (1831–1836) and in the Astronomical Society&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Notices&quot; (1852–1853); and two &quot;Reports&quot; to the British Association on railway constants (1838, 1841) are from his pen.

==Involvement in scandal==
In 1840 Lardner&#x27;s career received a major setback as a result of his involvement with Mary Spicer Heaviside, the wife of Captain Richard Heaviside, of the Dragoon Guards. He had previously been married to Cecilia Flood from 1815 to their separation in 1820. Lardner ran off to Paris with Mrs Heaviside, pursued by her husband. When he caught up with them, Heaviside subjected Lardner to a flogging but he was unable to persuade his wife to return with him. Later that year he successfully sued Lardner for &quot;criminal conversation&quot; (adultery) and received a judgment of £8,000. 

The Heavisides were divorced in 1845, and in 1846 Lardner was able to marry Mary Heaviside. The scandal caused by his affair with a married woman effectively ended his career in England, so Lardner and his wife remained in Paris until shortly before his death in 1859. He was able to maintain his career by lecturing in the United States between 1841 and 1844, which proved financially rewarding, realising £40,000.

He died in Naples, Italy, and is buried in the Cimitero degli Inglesi there.

==Disagreements with Brunel==
Lardner became involved in a number of ill-advised public disagreements with Isambard Kingdom Brunel regarding technical matters, in which he came off the worse.

During the 1833 Parliamentary hearings discussing the proposal of the Great Western Railway, Lardner criticised Brunel&#x27;s design of the Box Tunnel. The tunnel had a 1-in-100 gradient from the east end to the west end. Lardner asserted that if a train&#x27;s brakes were to fail in the tunnel, it would accelerate to over , at which speed the train would break up and kill the passengers. Brunel pointed out that Lardner&#x27;s calculations totally disregarded air resistance and friction, a basic error.

In 1836, when Brunel was proposing to build &quot;SS Great Western&quot; for the transatlantic passage to New York, at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Lardner stated that: As the project of making the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was perfectly chimerical, and they might as well talk of making the voyage from New York to the moon... is the longest run that a steamer could encounter – at the end of that distance she would require a relay of coals. 

Again, Brunel was able to show that Lardner&#x27;s calculations were too simplistic. The principle that Brunel understood, which Lardner did not, was that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This meant that large ships were more fuel efficient, and could carry sufficient coal for the long voyage across the Atlantic. Brunel was proved right when the &quot;Great Western&quot; steamed into New York harbour with of coal to spare.

In 1838 while Brunel was building the broad-gauge Great Western Railway, Lardner carried out some experiments with the company&#x27;s flagship locomotive, &quot;North Star&quot;. He asserted that, whilst the engine was capable of hauling at , it was only capable of hauling at . He also recorded excessive fuel consumption at higher speeds. Lardner attributed this to the greater wind resistance of broad-gauge engines. Brunel and his assistant Daniel Gooch carried out their own experiments on the same locomotive and found that the only problem was that the blast pipe was too small. This was easily rectified and the North Star&#x27;s performance immediately improved. At the next meeting of the company&#x27;s directors, Brunel triumphantly dismissed Lardner&#x27;s evidence.

== Contemporary influence==
Lardner is mentioned in Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; and was well respected as an economist. He mixed with the rich and famous. He was involved in the founding of the University of London and was the first person to hold the post of Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy there. He was influential in publicising Charles Babbage&#x27;s Difference Engine.

Whilst lecturing in America Lardner was paid by Norris Brothers, the largest firm of locomotive builders, to investigate a fatal accident in Reading, near Philadelphia, where a boiler had exploded on a newly made train. Lardner pronounced that the accident had been caused by lightning, which meant that Norris Brothers were not personally liable for the accident. A committee of the Franklin Institute pointed out that there was no lightning present at that time and that the pumps had been faulty, the water indicator was ill-designed and the bridge bands made of cast iron rather than wrought iron. The Coroner&#x27;s inquest jury were persuaded by Lardner that the accident was an &#x27;act of God&#x27; but the company were careful to design their later locomotives with wrought-iron bands.

<text>Marken (; Marken&#x27;s dialect: &quot;Mereke&quot;) is a village in the municipality of Waterland in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. It had a population of 1,745 as of 2021, and occupies a peninsula in the Markermeer. It was, until 1957, an island in the former Zuiderzee. The characteristic wooden houses of Marken are a tourist attraction.

==History==
===Early years===
Marken was an island in the Zuiderzee.

For some time during the later 19th and early 20th centuries, Marken and its inhabitants were the focus of considerable attention by folklorists, ethnographers and physical anthropologists, who regarded the small fishing town as a relic of the traditional native culture that was destined to disappear as modernization of the Netherlands gained pace. Among them were Johann Friedrich Blumenbach who examined a human skull from the island which he called Batavus genuinus; and was the Belgian painter Xavier Mellery who stayed in Marken at the request of Charles De Coster. Mellery was asked to create illustrative work and delivered several intimist works.

Cornelis Lely&#x27;s designs incorporated the island into a proposed Markerwaard. A partial dike, built in 1941 in the north, is the first phase of that project which was stopped by World War II.

===Recent times===
The island appeared as a location in the 1970 film &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;. In 1983, the Marker Museum about the history of the island was opened. Marken was a separate municipality until 1991, when it was merged into Waterland.

== Geography ==
Marken is in the municipality of Waterland in the east of the province of North Holland in the west of the Netherlands. Marken is a peninsula in the Markermeer, of which is it is the namesake, and is connected to the mainland of North Holland by a causeway.

<doc id="220600" wikidata="Q1107900" url="?curid=220600" title="Henry Kater">
<text>Henry Kater FRS, FRAS (16 April 1777 – 26 April 1835) was a British physicist of German descent.

==Early life==
He was born at Bristol. At first he intended to study law; but he gave up the idea on his father&#x27;s death in 1794. He entered the army, obtaining a commission in the 12th Regiment of Foot, then stationed in India, where he assisted William Lambton in the Great Trigonometric Survey. Failing health obliged him to return to England; and in 1808, then a lieutenant, he entered on a student career at the Senior Division of the new Royal Military College at High Wycombe. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to the rank of captain. In 1814 he retired on half-pay, and devoted the remainder of his life to scientific research.

==Scientist==
His first major contribution to science was the comparison of the merits of the Cassegrainian and Gregorian telescopes; Kater determined the latter to be an inferior design.

His most substantial work was the invention of Kater&#x27;s pendulum, enabling the strength of gravity to be determined, first at London and subsequently at various stations throughout the country. As the inventor of the floating collimator, Kater rendered a service to practical astronomy. He also published memoirs on British standards of length and mass; and in 1832 he published an account of his work on verifying the Russian standards of length. For these services to Russia he received in 1814 the decoration of the order of St. Anne; and the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1826, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Kater was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832. In 1833 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.

He won the Copley Medal in 1817 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1831.

He is considered as the inventor of the prismatic compass, patented a year later by Charles Schmalcalder.
He also studied compass needles, his Bakerian lecture containing the results of many experiments. The treatise on &quot;Mechanics&quot; in Dionysius Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopedia&quot; was partly written by him; and his interest in more purely astronomical questions was shown by two papers in the &quot;Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; for 1831–1833 — one on an observation of Saturn&#x27;s outer ring, the other on a method of determining longitude by means of lunar eclipses.

<doc id="220602" wikidata="Q349109" url="?curid=220602" title="Israel Kirzner">
<text>Israel Meir Kirzner (also Yisroel Mayer Kirzner ; born February 13, 1930) is a British-born American economist, historian, rabbi, and Talmudist closely identified with the Austrian School.

==Early life and education==

The son of a well-known rabbi and Talmudist, Kirzner was born in London and reached the United States by way of South Africa.

After studying at the University of Cape Town, South Africa in 1947–48, and with the University of London External Programme in 1950–51, Kirzner received his B.A. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Brooklyn College in 1954, and an MBA in 1955 and Ph.D. in 1957 from New York University, where he studied under Ludwig von Mises.

Kirzner is also an ordained Rabbi; see below.

==Economics==

Kirzner is emeritus professor of economics at New York University and a leading authority on Ludwig von Mises&#x27;s thinking and methodology in economics. Kirzner&#x27;s research on entrepreneurship economics is also widely recognized. His book, &quot;Competition and Entrepreneurship&quot; criticizes neoclassical theory for its preoccupation with the model of perfect competition, which neglects the important role of the entrepreneur in economic life. Kirzner&#x27;s work integrating entrepreneurial action into neoclassical economics has been more widely accepted than nearly any other Austrian idea of the late twentieth century.

In 2006, Kirzner received the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research &quot;for developing the economic theory emphasizing the importance of the entrepreneur for economic growth and the functioning of the capitalist process.&quot; While Kirzner&#x27;s ideas have greatly impacted the field of entrepreneurship studies, he has mainly been associated with the opportunity discovery view. However, a careful reading of Kirzner&#x27;s work would suggest that his work on entrepreneurship can be split into two camps, one focusing on discovery and the other on creation.

Like Joseph Schumpeter, Kirzner&#x27;s work can arguably be divided into Kirzner Mark I and Kirzner Mark II. Kirzner&#x27;s major work is in the economics of knowledge and entrepreneurship and the ethics of markets. Kirzner has said that he agrees with Roger Garrison&#x27;s statement that Kirzner&#x27;s work takes the middle ground, as opposed to the recent, more extreme position of some Austrian School economists who deny the relevance of market equilibrium.

Universidad Francisco Marroquín granted him an Honorary Doctorate Degree for his contributions to economic theory. Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín UFM also named its Kirzner Entrepreneurship Center in his honor.

<text>Nuri Pasha al-Said CH (; December 1888 – 15 July 1958) was an Iraqi politician during the Mandatory Iraq and the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq. He held various key cabinet positions and served eight terms as Prime Minister of Iraq.

From his first appointment as prime minister under the British Mandate in 1930, Nuri was a major political figure in Iraq under the monarchy. The 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty granted Britain permanent military prerogatives in Iraq, but also paved the way for the country&#x27;s nominal independence and entry as a member of the League of Nations in 1932. Nuri was forced to flee the country after the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état which brought a pro-Nazi government to power, but following a British-led intervention he was re-installed as prime minister.

During the early fifties, Nuri&#x27;s government negotiated a fifty-fifty profit-sharing agreement on royalties with the Iraq Petroleum Company as oil began to play a significant role in the Iraqi economy. The agreement, along with the establishment of the Iraqi Development Board, provided for a series of ambitious schemes and projects to foster comprehensive economic growth in Iraq, and the private sector came to dominate the country&#x27;s economic activity. However, the working conditions of the poor remained poorly addressed, which further contributed to the growth of anti-monarchist sentiment. The formation of the Baghdad Pact in 1955 exacerbated discontent in the country.

A controversial figure throughout most of his career, Nuri was deeply unpopular amongst several fragments of Iraqi society by the end of 1950s. His political views, regarded as a blend of Iraqi nationalism, Conservatism, pro-Western sentiment, anti-Communism, and anti-Nasserism, were believed by his detractors to have failed in adapting to the country&#x27;s changed social circumstances. A coup d&#x27;état took place in July 1958 and led to the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. Nuri attempted to flee the country but was captured and killed.

== Early career ==

He was born in Baghdad to middle class Sunni Muslim family of North Caucasian origin. His father was a minor government accountant. Nuri graduated from a military college in Istanbul in 1906, trained at the staff college there in 1911 as an officer in the military of the Ottoman Empire and was among the officers dispatched to Ottoman Tripolitania in 1912 to resist the Italian occupation of that province. He was an elusive guerrilla leader, with Jaafar Al-Askari, against the British in Libya in 1915.

After being captured and held prisoner by the British in Egypt, he and Jaafar were converted to the Arab nationalist cause and fought in the Arab Revolt under Emir Faisal ibn Hussain of the Hejaz, who would later reign briefly as King of Arab Syria before he was installed as King of Iraq. On one operation Nuri rode with T. E. Lawrence and his British Army driver as crew of a Rolls-Royce Armoured Car.

Like other Iraqi officers who had served under Faisal, he went on to emerge as part of a new political elite.

== Political career ==

===Initial positions under Iraqi monarchy===
Nuri headed the Arab troops who took Damascus for Faisal in the wake of the retreating Turkish forces in 1918. When Faisal was deposed by the French in 1920, Nuri followed the exiled monarch to Iraq, and in 1922 became first director general of the Iraqi police force. He used the position to fill the force with his placemen, a tactic that he would repeat in subsequent positions; that was a basis of his considerable political clout in later years.

He was a trusted ally of Faisal who, in 1924, appointed him deputy commander in chief of the army so as to ensure the loyalty of the troops to the regime. Once again, Nuri used the position to build up his own power base. During the 1920s, he supported the king&#x27;s policy to build up the nascent state&#x27;s armed forces, based on the loyalty of Sharifian officers, the former Ottoman soldiers who formed the backbone of the regime.

===Prime Minister for first time===
Faisal first proposed Nuri as prime minister in 1929, but it was only in 1930 that the British were persuaded to forgo their objections. As in previous appointments, Nuri was quick to appoint supporters to key government positions, but that only weakened the king&#x27;s own base among the civil service, and the formerly close relationship between the two men soured. Among Nuri&#x27;s first acts as prime minister was the signing of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, an unpopular move since it essentially confirmed Britain&#x27;s mandatory powers and gave them permanent military prerogatives in the country even after full independence was achieved. In 1932, he presented the Iraqi case for greater independence to the League of Nations.

In October 1932, Faisal dismissed Nuri as Prime Minister and replaced him with Naji Shawkat, which curbed Nuri&#x27;s influence somewhat; after the death of Faisal the following year and the accession of Ghazi, his access to the palace decreased. Further impeding his influence was the rise of Yasin al-Hashimi, who would become prime minister for the first time in 1935. Nevertheless, Nuri continued to hold sway among the military establishment, and his position as a trusted ally of the British meant that he was never far from power. In 1933, the British persuaded Ghazi to appoint him foreign minister, a post he held until the Bakr Sidqi coup in 1936. However, his close ties to the British, which helped him remain in important positions of state, also destroyed any remaining popularity.

===Intriguing with army===
The Bakr Sidqi coup showed the extent to which Nuri had tied his fate to that of the British in Iraq: he was the only politician of the toppled government to seek refuge in the British Embassy, and his hosts sent him into exile in Egypt. He returned to Baghdad in August 1937 and began plotting his return to power in collaboration with Colonel Salah al-Din al-Sabbagh. That so perturbed Prime Minister Jamil al-Midfai that he persuaded the British that Nuri was a disruptive influence who would be better off abroad. They obliged by convincing Nuri to take up residence in London as the Iraqi ambassador. Despairing perhaps of his relationship with Ghazi, he now began to secretly suggest co-operation with the House of Saud.

Back in Baghdad in October 1938, Nuri re-established contact with al-Sabbagh, and persuaded him to overthrow the Midfai government. Al-Sabbagh and his cohorts launched their coup on 24 December 1938, and Nuri was reinstated as prime minister. He sought to sideline the king by promoting the position and possible succession of the latter&#x27;s half-brother Prince Zaid. Simultaneously, the British were irritated by Ghazi&#x27;s increasingly nationalistic broadcasts on his private radio station. In January 1939, the king further aggrieved Nuri by appointing Rashid Ali al-Gaylani head of the Royal Divan. Nuri&#x27;s campaign against his rivals continued in March that year, when he claimed to have unmasked a plot to murder Ghazi and used it as an excuse to carry out a purge of the army&#x27;s officer corps.

When Ghazi died in a car crash on 4 April 1939, Nuri was widely suspected of being implicated in his death. At the royal funeral crowds chanted, &quot;You will answer for the blood of Ghazi, Nuri&quot;. He supported the accession of &#x27;Abd al-Ilah as regent for Ghazi&#x27;s successor, Faisal II, who was still a minor. The new regent was initially susceptible to Nuri&#x27;s influence.

On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Soon, Germany and Britain were at war. In accordance with Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, Iraq was committed to declaring war on Germany. Instead, in an effort to maintain a neutral position, Nuri announced that Iraqi armed forces would not be employed outside of Iraq. While German officials were deported, Iraq would not declare war.

By then, affairs in Europe had begun to affect Iraq; the Battle of France in June 1940 encouraged some Arab nationalist elements to seek, in the style of the United States and Turkey, to move toward neutrality toward Germany and Italy rather than being part of the British war effort. While Nuri generally was more pro-British, al-Sabbagh moved into the camp more positively oriented toward Germany. The loss of his main military ally meant that Nuri &quot;quickly lost his ability to affect events&quot;.

===Co-existence with regent in the 1940s===
In April 1941, the pro-neutrality elements seized power, installing Rashid Ali al-Kaylani as prime minister. Nuri fled to British-controlled Transjordan; his protectors then sent him to Cairo, but after occupying Baghdad they brought him back, installing him as prime minister under the British occupation. He would retain the post for over two and half years, but from 1943 onward, the regent obtained a greater say in the selection of his ministers and began to assert greater independence. Iraq remained under British military occupation until late 1947. He served as the President of the Senate of Iraq from July 1945 to November 1946, and from 1948 to January 1949.

The regent&#x27;s brief flirtation with more liberal policies in 1947 did little to stave off the problems that the established order was facing. The social and economic structures of the country had changed considerably since the establishment of the monarchy, with an increased urban population, a rapidly growing middle class, and increasing political consciousness among the peasants and the working class, in which the Iraqi Communist Party was playing a growing role. However, the political elite, with its strong ties and shared interests with the dominant classes, was unable to take the radical steps that might have preserved the monarchy. The attempt by the elite to retain power during the last ten years of the monarchy, Nuri rather than the regent would increasingly play the dominant role, thanks largely to his superior political skills.

===Regime resists growing political unrest===
In November 1946, an oil workers&#x27; strike culminated in a massacre of the strikers by the police, and Nuri was brought back as premier. He briefly brought the Liberals and National Democrats into the cabinet, but soon reverted to the more repressive approach he generally favoured, ordering the arrest of numerous communists in January 1947. Those captured included party secretary Fahd. Meanwhile, Britain attempted to legalise a permanent military presence in Iraq even beyond the terms of the 1930 treaty although it no longer had World War II to justify its continued presence there. Both Nuri and the regent increasingly saw their unpopular links with Great Britain as the best guarantee of their own position, and accordingly set about co-operating in the creation of a new Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. In early January 1948 Nuri himself joined the negotiating delegation in England, and on 15 January the treaty was signed.

The response on the streets of Baghdad was immediate and furious. After six years of British occupation, no single act could have been less popular than giving the British an even larger legal role in Iraq&#x27;s affairs. Demonstrations broke out the following day, with students playing a prominent part and the Communist Party guiding much of the anti-government activity. The protests intensified over the following days, until the police fired on a mass demonstration (20 January), leaving many casualties. On the following days, &#x27;Abd al-Ilah disavowed the new treaty. Nuri returned to Baghdad on 26 January and immediately implemented a harsh policy of repression against the protesters. At mass demonstration the next day, police fired again at the protesters, leaving many more dead. In his struggle to implement the treaty, Nuri had destroyed any credibility that he had left. He retained considerable power throughout the country, but he was generally hated.

He was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible, and on 21 August 1950, he threatened to revoke the license of the company transporting the Jewish exodus if it did not fulfill its daily quota of 500 Jews. On 18 September 1950, Nuri summoned a representative of the Jewish community, claimed Israel was behind the emigration delay and threatened to &quot;take them to the borders&quot; and expel the Jews.

In 1950, Nuri Al-Said turned to building up Iraq&#x27;s internal strength by concentrating on economic development. He replaced the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1948) with a new oil agreement with the Iraq Petroleum Company on the basis of 50/50 profit sharing, which increased the amount of funds available for development. This allowed for the establishment of the Development Board for reconstruction which launched a series of ambitious schemes and projects to foster comprehensive growth in Iraq. Private capital invested in industry amounted to about ID 4 million in 1953, rising to nearly ID 20 million by 1956, although the working conditions of the poor had hardly been assessed, which led to reprimand by the ever-growing anti-monarchist sentiment in Iraq.

The next major political demarche with which Nuri&#x27;s name would be associated was the Baghdad Pact, a series of agreements concluded between 1954 and 1955, which tied Iraq politically and militarily with the Western powers and their regional allies, notably Turkey. The pact was especially important to Nuri, as it was favoured by the British and Americans. On the other hand, it was also contrary to the political aspirations of most of the country. Taking advantage of the situation, Nuri stepped up his policies of political repression and censorship. 

The political situation deteriorated in 1956, when Israel, France and Britain colluded in an invasion of Egypt, in response to the nationalisation of the Suez Canal by President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nuri was overjoyed with the tripartite move and instructed the radio station to play &quot;The Postmen Complained about the Abundance of My Letters&quot; as a way to mock Nasser, whose father was a postal clerk. However, Nuri then publicly condemned the invasion, as the national sentiment was strongly for Egypt. The invasion exacerbated popular mistrust of the Baghdad Pact, and Nuri responded by refusing to sit with British representatives during a meeting of the Pact and cut off diplomatic relations with France. According to historian Adeeb Dawish, &quot;Nuri&#x27;s circumspect response hardly placated the seething populace.&quot;

Mass protests and disturbances occurred throughout the country, in Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, Kufa, Najaf and al-Hillah. In response Nuri decreed martial law and sent in troops to some southern cities to suppress the riots, while in Baghdad, nearly 400 protesters were detained. Nuri&#x27;s political position was weakened, so much that he became more &quot;discouraged and depressed&quot; than ever before (according to the British ambassador) and was genuinely fearful that he would be unable to restore stability. Meanwhile, the opposition began to co-ordinate its activities: in February 1957, a Front of National Union was established, bringing together the National Democrats, the Independents, the Communists, and the Ba&#x27;th Party. A similar process within the military officer corps followed, with the formation of the Supreme Committee of Free Officers. However, Nuri&#x27;s attempts to preserve the loyalty of the military by generous benefits failed.

The Iraqi monarchy and its Hashemite ally in Jordan reacted to the union between Egypt and Syria (February 1958) by forming the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan. (Kuwait was asked to enter the union; however, the British opposed this.) Nuri was the first prime minister of the new federation, which was soon ended with the coup that toppled the Iraqi monarchy.

==Death==
===14 July Revolution===
As the 1958 Lebanon crisis escalated, Jordan requested the help of Iraqi troops, who feigned to be &quot;en route&quot; there on 14 July. Instead, they moved on to Baghdad, and on that day, Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim and Colonel Abdul Salam Arif seized control of the country and ordered the Royal Family to evacuate the Rihab Palace in Baghdad. They congregated in the courtyard—King Faisal II; Prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah and his wife Princess Hiyam; Princess Nafeesa, Abdul Ilah&#x27;s mother; Princess Abadiya, the king&#x27;s aunt; and several servants. The group was ordered to turn facing the wall and were shot down by Captain Abdus Sattar As Sab&#x27;, a member of the coup. After almost four decades, the monarchy had been toppled.

Nuri went into hiding, but he was captured the next day as he sought to make his escape. He was shot dead and buried that same day, but an angry mob disinterred his corpse and dragged it through the streets of Baghdad, where it was hung up, burned and mutilated, ultimately being run over repeatedly by municipal buses, until his corpse was unrecognizable.

==Personal life and family==
Nuri and his wife had one son, Sabah As-Said, who married an Egyptian heiress, Esmat Ali Pasha Fahmi in 1936. They had two sons: Falah (born 1937) and Issam (born 1938). Sabah As-Said is supposed to have taken an Iraqi-Jewish woman as a second wife and had a child with her when Jews accounted for 25-40% of Baghdad&#x27;s population. After being ousted from Iraq, both his second wife and child fled to Israel.

Falah, who worked as King Hussein&#x27;s personal pilot, was first married to Nahla El-Askari and had one son, Sabah. He later married Dina Fawaz Maher in 1974, the daughter of a Jordanian army general, Fawaz Pasha Maher, and had two daughters: Sima and Zaina.

Falah died in a car accident in Jordan in 1983. Issam was an artist and architect based in London who died in 1988 from a heart attack.

<text>Moyra Tamsin Dunwoody (born 3 September 1958), sometimes known as Tamsin Dunwoody-Kneafsey, is a British Labour politician who served as the Member of the National Assembly for Wales for Preseli Pembrokeshire from 2003 to 2007. She served in the Welsh Government from 2005 to 2007 as the Deputy Minister for Environment, Planning and Countryside and Deputy Minister for Economic Development and Transport.

Dunwoody unsuccessfully stood to succeed her mother, Gwyneth Dunwoody, as the Labour candidate in the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election.

==Early life==
Dunwoody was born in Totnes, Devon, the daughter of the late Labour MPs Gwyneth Dunwoody, and Dr John Dunwoody. Both of her parents lost their parliamentary seats at the 1970 general election, although her mother went on to represent Crewe and its successor, Crewe and Nantwich for 34 years until she died. Through her mother she is the granddaughter of former Labour Party General Secretary Morgan Phillips and Norah Phillips. She was educated at the Grey Coat Hospital Church of England girls&#x27; school in Westminster and the University of Kent. She has five children.

==Professional career==
Dunwoody trained in the National Health Service, and worked in London hospitals for nearly 15 years. She has also been an adviser to small businesses in west Wales and lived in Haverfordwest.

==Political career==

Dunwoody was elected (under the name Tamsin Dunwoody-Kneafsey) as Assembly Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire from 2003 to 2007. In October 2005 she was appointed Deputy Minister for Environment, Planning and Countryside and Deputy Minister for Economic Development and Transport in the Welsh Assembly Government. She was defeated in the 2007 election by Conservative Party candidate Paul Davies.

She was selected as the Labour candidate at the Crewe and Nantwich by-election, held on 22 May 2008, which was triggered by the death of her mother. She lost to Conservative candidate Edward Timpson, by 7,860 votes marking the first Conservative Party parliamentary by-election victory in a Labour-held constituency since 1978. The last parliamentary by-election in which the Conservatives had gained a seat previously held by another party was in 1982, in Mitcham and Morden.

She unsuccessfully sought the Labour nomination for Islwyn ahead of the 2010 general election.

<doc id="220606" wikidata="Q61265" url="?curid=220606" title="Ludwig Lachmann">
<text>Ludwig Maurits Lachmann (; ; 1 February 1906 – 17 December 1990) was a German economist, economic theorist and important contributor to the Austrian School of Economics. Lachmann, Israel Kirzner, and Murray Rothbard were the three primary catalysts of the Austrian &#x27;revival&#x27;, beginning in 1974. He wrote on economic theory, history, and methodology, as well as on the application of Hermeneutics to economic thought, in order to interpret economic phenomena.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Ludwig Lachmann was born in Berlin, Germany on 1 February 1906 into a Jewish middle-class family. His father was a metal manufacturer, and his mother came from an intellectual background and had a strong influence on young Ludwig. His mother&#x27;s brother, a bank official, also had a strong influence upon his nephew&#x27;s early intellectual development. Ludwig was an only child, and initially was educated by his mother, but was later enrolled in . His childhood years are generally described as happy, which would contrast with his later life in Germany, surrounded by constant political and economic instability and crisis.

=== Education and &#x27;pre-revival&#x27; career ===
Lachmann enrolled at the University of Berlin in 1924, studying under, among others, Werner Sombart, who introduced Lachmann to the works of Weber, that had a lifelong influence on Lachmann&#x27;s work. He took a semester at the University of Zurich in 1926, and around the same time, he was introduced into the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. He graduated in 1930, and spent a few years to teach at the University. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, Lachmann moved to England with his girlfriend Margot. The couple struggled financially, and Lachmann, unable to find a post in an academic position, enrolled at the London School of Economics. At the London School of Economics he was a student and later colleague of Friedrich Hayek. One of Lachmann&#x27;s fellow students was George Shackle, whose ideas would influence Lachmann&#x27;s later work. He deepened his interest in the Austrian School, and was one of the few who chose Hayek&#x27;s side, though not uncritically, following the so-called &#x27;Keynesian Revolution&#x27;. In 1938, Lachmann was awarded the Leon Fellowship from the University of London to study &#x27;secondary depressions&#x27;. In this research project, he traveled to the United States, where he met Alfred Schütz and Frank Knight, and attended the seminars of the latter. Following the outbreak of war in Europe, Lachmann, a German national, was interned by British authorities from July to December 1940. In 1941, following his release, he was appointed as an economic lecturer at the University of London. In 1943, he was appointed to the Head of the Department of Economics at the University of Hull, a position he held until he departed from England in 1948.

In 1948, Lachmann moved to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he accepted a professorship at the University of the Witwatersrand. During this time, he published his seminal work, &quot;Capital and Its Structure&quot; in 1956. He served as president of the Economic Society of South Africa from 1962 to 1963. He remained teaching at Witwatersrand until retiring in 1972.

=== Austrian &#x27;revival&#x27;, 1974–1987 and death ===
In 1974, a conference on Austrian economics was organized in South Royalton, Vermont, in which Lachmann was a key speaker, along with Israel Kirzner and Murray Rothbard. This conference led to the publication of the 1976 book, &quot;The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics&quot;, to which Lachmann contributed. Following the conference, Lachmann began annual trips to New York City, where he worked with Kirzner at NYU, advancing research and lecturing to students. Lachmann also was engaged in an economic debate with Kirzner regarding notions of equilibrium, and the role of the entrepreneur Lachmann continued this work from 1975 to 1987, when he re-retired to Johannesburg. Lachmann died on 17 December 1990. To commemorate Lachmann, his widow established a trust to fund the &quot;Ludwig M. Lachmann Research Fellowship&quot; at the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method of the London School of Economics.

=== Personal life ===
Lachmann met his future wife, Margot Wulff, in the late 20&#x27;s at an Italian language class. They ran into each other again in Sankt Moritz, and began a relationship. When their financial situation became secure, the couple got married in England, in 1939. Their marriage was described as, &quot;a successful match,&quot; by Ludwig&#x27;s former colleague, Karl Mittermaier.

Lachmann himself has been described as &quot;a very unusual man&quot; and an &quot;old world European gentleman&quot; and one with a personality that left a lasting impression on those who knew him. He was described as &quot;unfailingly gracious and considerate&quot;. He was also described as both intentionally and unintentionally humorous.

==On economics==
Lachmann grew to believe that the Austrian School had deviated from Carl Menger&#x27;s original vision of an entirely subjective economics. To Lachmann, Austrian Theory was an evolutionary, or &quot;genetic-causal&quot; approach, as opposed to the equilibrium and perfect-knowledge models used in mainstream neoclassical economics.
He was a strong advocate of using hermeneutic methods in the study of economic phenomena.
Lachmann&#x27;s &quot;fundamentalist Austrianism&quot; was rare as few living Austrian economists departed from the mainstream. He underscored what he viewed as distinctive from that mainstream: economic subjectivism, imperfect knowledge, the heterogeneity of capital, the business cycle, methodological individualism, alternative cost and &quot;market process&quot;. His brand of Austrianism now forms the basis for the &quot;radical subjectivist&quot; strand of Austrian Economics.
His work influenced later American developments of the Austrian School. Fellow Austrian Economist Israel Kirzner was a close friend of Lachmann&#x27;s whom he aligned with intellectually (though they disagreed on some finer details).

== Contemporary social science research ==
Lachmann&#x27;s ideas continue to influence contemporary social science research. Many social scientific disciplines explicitly or implicitly build on the subjective theory of value, developed by Carl Menger and the Austrian School of Economics.

<text>Luigi Schiavonetti (1 April 1765 – 7 June 1810) was an Italian reproductive engraver and etcher.

== Life ==
Luigi Schiavonetti was born at Bassano in Venetia. He was the maternal nephew of Teodoro Viero. After having studied art for several years he was employed by Testolini, an engraver of very indifferent abilities, to execute imitations of Bartolozzi&#x27;s works, which he passed off as his own. In 1790, Testolini was invited by Bartolozzi to join him in England, and, it having been discovered that Schiavonetti, who accompanied him, had executed the plates in question, he was employed by Bartolozzi and became an eminent engraver in both the line and the stipple manner. Among his early works are four plates of subjects from the French Revolution, after Peter Paul Benazech.

Schiavonetti engraved a drawing of Maria Cosway that her husband, the artist Richard Cosway, had drawn. He also engraved a portrait that Maria Cosway had commissioned that was the first portrait of Napoleon seen in Britain.

He also produced a &quot;Mater Dolorosa&quot; after Van Dyck, and Michelangelo&#x27;s cartoon of the Battle of Cascina depicting the &quot;Surprise of the Soldiers on the Banks of the Arno.&quot; From 1805 to 1808, he was engaged in etching William Blake&#x27;s designs to Blair&#x27;s &quot;Grave&quot;, which, with a portrait of the artist engraved by Schiavonetti after Thomas Phillips RA, were published in 1808. The etching of Stothard&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Pilgrims&quot; was one of his latest works, and on his death the plate was taken up by his brother Niccolo, and finally completed by James Heath.

<doc id="220611" wikidata="Q734889" url="?curid=220611" title="Francesco Bartolozzi">
<text>Francesco Bartolozzi (21 September 1727 – 7 March 1815) was an Italian engraver, whose most productive period was spent in London. He is noted for popularizing the &quot;crayon&quot; method of engraving.

==Early life==
Bartolozzi was born in Florence in 1727. He was originally destined to follow the profession of his father, a gold- and silver-smith, but he manifested so much skill and taste in designing that he was placed under the supervision of two Florentine artists, Ignazio Hugford and Giovanni Domenico Ferretti, who instructed him in painting. After devoting three years to that art, he went to Venice and studied engraving. He spent six years there working for Joseph Wagner, an engraver and printseller, before setting up his own workshop.

==Early career==
His first productions in Venice were plates in the style of Marco Ricci and Francesco Zuccarelli. He then moved for a short time in 1762 to Rome, where he completed a set of engravings representing frescoes at Grottaferrata by Domenichino depicting the &quot;life of St Nilus&quot;. Those and his etchings of Old Master&#x27;s works, began to draw attention throughout Europe. In 1763 he met Richard Dalton, the English Royal Librarian who was traveling in Italy looking for acquisitions for the King&#x27;s collections. Dalton offered him an appointment as Engraver to the King; Bartolozzi accepted and left for London in 1764.

==Career in London==
He lived in London for nearly forty years. He produced an enormous number of engravings, including &quot;Clytie&quot; after Annibale Carracci, and of the Virgin and Child, after Carlo Dolci. A large proportion of them are from the works of Cipriani and Angelica Kauffman. Bartolozzi also contributed a number of plates to Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery. He also drew sketches of his own in red chalk. Soon after arriving in London, he was appointed &#x27;Engraver to the King&#x27; (George III) with an annual salary of £300. He was elected a founding member of the Royal Academy. The new Academy&#x27;s bylaws specifically excluded engravers but Bartolozzi was so well esteemed that he was brought in as an Academician in the category of Painter. In 1802 he became the founding President of the short-lived Society of Engravers.

While Bartolozzi was not the original inventor of the crayon manner of engraving, he became a leading exponent that &quot;stipple&quot; method and it became associated with him. With that technique images are created by delicate dots rather than lines as in traditional etchings or engravings. Bartolozzi added distinction to his work by using red (sanguine), orange and brown inks rather than common black ink.

As his prominence grew, he took on students including Michele Benedetti, Ignatius Joseph van den Berghe, Thomas Cheesman, Lambertus Antonius Claessens, Daniel Gardner, Christiaan Josi, Johan Fredrik Martin, Conrad Martin Metz, Luigi Schiavonetti, John Keyse Sherwin, Heinrich Sintzenich, Peltro William Tomkins, Domenico Bernardo Zilotti, and Gavriil Skorodumov.

His son Gaetano Stefano Bartolozzi, born in 1757, also became an engraver and later fathered Madame Vestris a celebrated English actress, opera singer, and theater manager.

==Career in Lisbon==
In 1802, Bartolozzi accepted the post of director of the National Academy of Lisbon and moved there with the intention of reforming the royal press and producing an edition of the Portuguese epic poem &quot;The Lusiads (Os Lusíadas)&quot;. By then he was in his seventies and delegated much of the work to one of his students.

Despite his fame and prolific output, debts forced him to sell off most of his prints and possessions. Bartolozzi died in his studio in 1815 and was buried in the common grave of a Lisbon church.

<text>John Boydell ( ; – 12 December 1804) was an English publisher noted for his reproductions of engravings. He helped alter the trade imbalance between Britain and France in engravings and initiated an English tradition in the art form. A former engraver himself, Boydell promoted the interests of artists as well as patrons and as a result his business prospered.

The son of a land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed himself to William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He established his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer as well as an artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett&#x27;s spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Destruction of the Children of Niobe&quot;, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, largely as a result of Boydell&#x27;s initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.

In the 1790s, Boydell began a large Shakespeare venture that included the establishment of a Shakespeare Gallery, the publication of an illustrated edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and the release of a folio of prints depicting scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s works. Some of the most illustrious painters of the day contributed, such as Benjamin West and Henry Fuseli.

Throughout his life, Boydell dedicated time to civic projects: he donated art to government institutions and ran for public office. In 1790 he became Lord Mayor of London. The French Revolutionary Wars led to a cessation in Continental trade at the end of the 1790s. Without this business, Boydell&#x27;s firm declined and he was almost bankrupt at his death in 1804.

==Early years==
Boydell was born, according to his monument in St Olave Old Jewry, London (later removed to St Margaret Lothbury after St Olave&#x27;s demolition), at Dorrington, in the parish of Woore, Shropshire, to Josiah and Mary Boydell (), and was educated at least partially at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. His father was a land surveyor and young Boydell, the oldest of seven children, was expected to follow in his footsteps. In 1731, when Boydell was eleven, the family moved to Hawarden, Flintshire. In 1739 he became house steward to MP John Lawton and accompanied him to London. A year later, like many other enterprising young men of the time, Boydell resolved to sail to the East Indies in hopes of making his fortune, but he abandoned the scheme in favour of returning to Flintshire and Elizabeth Lloyd, the woman he was courting. Whether or not he intended to pursue land surveying at this time is unclear.

In either 1740 or 1741, Boydell saw a print of Hawarden Castle by William Henry Toms and was so delighted with it that he immediately set out again for London to learn printmaking and Lloyd promised to wait for him. Boydell apprenticed himself to Toms and enrolled in St Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy to learn drawing. Each day he worked about fourteen hours for Toms and then attended drawing classes at night. After six years, Boydell&#x27;s diligence allowed him to buy out the last year of his apprenticeship, and in 1746 he set up an independent shop on the Strand that specialised in topographical prints that cost six pence for a cheap print or one shilling for an expensive print.

Boydell&#x27;s willingness to assume responsibility for his own business so early in his career indicates that he had ambition and an enterprising spirit. Independent shops were risky in the 1740s because no strict copyright laws, other than the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 (8 Geo. 2. c. 13) (known as &quot;Hogarth&#x27;s Act&quot;), had yet been instituted. The pirating of published books and prints became a profession in its own right and greatly decreased the profits of publishers such as Boydell.
Around 1747, Boydell published his first major work, &quot;The Bridge Book&quot;, for which he drew and cut each print himself. It cost one shilling and contained six landscapes in each of which, not surprisingly, a bridge featured prominently. A year later, in 1748, Boydell, apparently financially secure, married Elizabeth Lloyd. The couple did not have any children and Elizabeth died in 1781.

Boydell realised early in his career that his engravings had little artistic merit, saying later that they were collected by others &quot;more to show the improvement of art in this country [Britain], since the period of their publication, than from any idea of their own merits&quot;. This may explain why in 1751, when he became a member of the Stationers&#x27; Company, he started buying other artists&#x27; plates and publishing them in addition to his own. Ordinarily an engraver, such as William Hogarth, had his own shop or took his finished engravings to a publisher. In adopting the dual role of artist and print dealer, Boydell altered the traditional organisation of print shops. He was not subject to the whims of public taste: if his engravings did not sell well, he could supplement his earnings by trading in the prints of other artists. He also understood the concerns of both the engraver and the publisher. In fact, as a publisher, he did much to help raise the level of respect for engravers in addition to furnishing them with better paying commissions.

==Success==
In 1751, with his large volume of prints, Boydell moved to larger premises at 90 Cheapside. By 1755, he had published &quot;A Collection of One Hundred and Two Views, &amp;C. in England and Wales&quot;. This cheap but successful book gave him capital to invest. He became increasingly immersed in the commercial side of the print business and like most print dealers began importing prints to sell. These included print reproductions of landscapes by artists such as Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa. The bulk of the imports came from the undisputed masters of engraving during the 18th century: the French. Boydell made a small fortune in the 1750s from these imported prints. His early success was acknowledged in 1760 when he was accepted as a member of the Society of Arts. Winifred Friedman, who has written extensively on Boydell, explains that despite this success, &quot;[w]hat rankled Boydell was that the French would not extend credit, or exchange prints; he was required to produce hard cash. Boydell took action, and this was the turning point.&quot;

In 1761, Boydell decided that he would attempt to trade with the French in kind—something they had refused in the past because of the poor quality of British engravings. To inaugurate this change, he had to have a truly spectacular print. To this end, he hired William Woollett, the foremost engraver in England, to engrave Richard Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Destruction of the Children of Niobe&quot;. Woollett had already successfully engraved Claude Lorrain&#x27;s 1663 painting &quot;The Father of Psyche Sacrificing at the Temple of Apollo&quot; for Boydell in 1760. Boydell paid him approximately £100 for the &quot;Niobe&quot; engraving, a staggering amount compared to the usual rates. This single act of patronage raised engravers&#x27; fees throughout London. The print was wildly successful, but more importantly, the French accepted it as payment in kind. In fact, it was the first British print actively desired on the Continent. By 1770, the British were exporting far more prints than they were importing, largely due to Boydell.

Boydell&#x27;s business flourished and he soon hired his nephew, Josiah Boydell, to assist him. Boydell&#x27;s biographer, Sven Bruntjen, hypothesizes that one of the reasons for Boydell&#x27;s early and phenomenal success was his specialisation. Unlike &quot;his competitors [who sold manuals, atlases and other assorted books] ... his [business had an] almost exclusive concentration on the sale of reproductive prints&quot;. Bruntjen argues that &quot;despite the extensive sales of varied types of reproductive prints, it was the contemporary history print which accounted for the major part of Boydell&#x27;s success as a print dealer&quot;. Most notable among these was the &quot;Death of General Wolfe&quot; a 1770 painting by Benjamin West, engraved by Woollett for Boydell in 1776. As early as 1767, Boydell had stopped engraving prints himself and began exclusively relying on commissions and trades and it was from these that he profited.
Boydell had opened up a new market with &quot;Niobe&quot; and he quickly followed up this success. With a prospering business and capital in reserve, he embarked on several ambitious projects, often simultaneously. In 1769, he began &quot;A Collection of Prints, Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in England&quot;. Its last, and ninth volume, was finished in 1792 to great critical and financial success. In 1773, he began &quot;A Set of Prints Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in the Collection of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of Russia, Lately in the Possession of the Earl of Orford at Houghton in Norfolk&quot;, which was finished in 1788.

In addition to these projects and in the middle of his Shakespeare undertaking Boydell experimented with aquatint in &quot;An History of the River Thames&quot;, published in 1796. Bruntjen writes, &quot;although not the first colored aquatint book, [it] was the first major one, and it was to set an example for the type of illustration that was to enjoy widespread popularity in England for some forty years&quot;. Boydell also published &quot;The Original Work of William Hogarth&quot; in 1790 and &quot;The Poetical Works of John Milton&quot; and &quot;The Life of the Poet&quot; (i.e., Milton) in 1794.

The productivity and profitability of Boydell&#x27;s firm spurred the British print industry in general. By 1785, annual exports of British prints reached £200,000 while imports fell to £100. Boydell was acknowledged and praised throughout England as the agent of this stunning economic reversal. In 1773 he was awarded the Royal Academy Gold Medal for his services in advancing the print trade. In 1789, at the Royal Academy dinner, the Prince of Wales toasted &quot;an English tradesman who patronizes art better than the Grand Monarque, Alderman Boydell, the Commercial Maecenas&quot;.

==Shakespeare venture==

Boydell&#x27;s crowning achievement was his Shakespeare project, which was to occupy much of the last two decades of his life. The project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, a public gallery of paintings depicting scenes from the plays, and a folio of prints based on the paintings.

The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived at a dinner at Josiah Boydell&#x27;s home in November 1786. The guest list itself is evidence of Boydell&#x27;s extensive connections in the artistic world: Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king and painter; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, an engineer. Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell&#x27;s, he was the one to seize and pursue it. He wanted to use the edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting.

The &quot;magnificent and accurate&quot; Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was the focus of the enterprise. The print folio and the gallery were simply offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that &quot;splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition&quot;. Boydell was responsible for the &quot;splendor&quot;, and George Steevens, a renowned Shakespearean editor, was responsible for the &quot;correctness of text&quot;. The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages. Even the quality of the paper was extraordinarily high. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the customer desired. The first volumes of the &quot;Dramatick Works&quot; were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. The edition was financed through a subscription campaign in which the buyers would offer partial payment up front and then pay the remaining sum on delivery. This practice was necessitated by the fact that over £350,000—an enormous sum at the time—was eventually spent on the enterprise.

When it opened on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery contained 34 paintings and by the end of its run it had between 167 and 170. The Gallery itself was a hit with the public and became a fashionable attraction. It took over the public&#x27;s imagination and became an end in and of itself.
To illustrate the edition and to provide images for the folio, Boydell obtained the assistance of the most eminent painters and engravers of the day. Artists included Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, Robert Smirke, John Opie, and Boydell&#x27;s nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell. Among the engravers were Francesco Bartolozzi and Thomas Kirk. Boydell&#x27;s relationships with his artists, particularly his illustrators, was generally congenial. James Northcote praised Boydell&#x27;s liberal payments. He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell &quot;did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall every hold in reverence&quot;.

At the beginning of the enterprise, reactions were generally positive. Two reviews from the most influential newspapers in London at the time solidified and validated the public&#x27;s interest in the project and the artists&#x27; efforts. However, there was also some criticism. In particular the satirical engraver James Gillray appears to have been peeved at not being commissioned to engrave any of the Shakespeare scenes and, in revenge, published &quot;Shakespeare Sacrificed: Or the Offering to Avarice&quot; just six weeks after the gallery opened. Gillray followed up with further cartoons such as &quot;Boydell sacrificing the Works of Shakespeare to the Devil of Money-Bags&quot;. As the project dragged on, the criticism increased. Yet, Boydell&#x27;s project still inspired imitators. Thomas Macklin attempted to found a Poet&#x27;s Gallery similar to the Shakespeare Gallery and several histories of England on the scale of the Shakespeare edition were also started. However, like Boydell&#x27;s venture, they ultimately ended in financial disaster.

The folio, which collected together the engravings from the paintings, has been the most lasting legacy of the Boydell enterprise: it was reissued throughout the 19th century and scholars have described it as a precursor to the modern coffee table book.

==Civic service==
Amidst all of the work generated by these publishing enterprises, Boydell still found time to be alderman of Cheap ward in 1782, master of the Stationers&#x27; Company in 1783, sheriff of London in 1785, and Lord Mayor of London in 1790. With both a dedicated civic spirit and an eye towards business promotion, Boydell took advantage of his public positions to advocate public and private patronage of the arts. He frequently donated paintings from his own collections to the Corporation of London to be hung in the Guildhall. He hoped that his donation might spur others to similar generosity. However, he remained a solitary contributor. A catalogue was published in 1794 listing all of the works Boydell had donated to the Guildhall. In the preface, he explained why he had made such large gifts:
It may be a matter of wonder to some, what enducements I could have to present the City of London with so many expensive Pictures; the principal reasons that influence me were these: First: to show my respect for the Corporation, and my Fellow Citizens, Secondly: to give pleasure to the Public, and Foreigners in general, Thirdly: to be of service to the Artists, by shewing their works to the greatest advantage: and, Fourthly: for the mere purpose of pleasing myself.

In 1794 Boydell commissioned and donated &quot;Industry and Prudence&quot; by Robert Smirke. Most of the other works Boydell donated were similarly didactic. He was appealing to his fellow tradespeople and craftspeople with these gifts, a middle class which would have been only too pleased to see their values promoted by such a prominent figure.

In a speech before the Council to advocate the renovation of a building for the purpose of displaying public art, Boydell made the striking claim that if the rich could be persuaded to patronise art, they would forgo their wicked ways:

one might be found amongst the many spendthrifts of the present age, instead of ruining themselves by gaming, or laying snares to debauch young Females, by their false promises and many other bad vices; would be rejoiced at such an opportunity, of reclaiming themselves by withdrawing from the snares laid for them by bad and designing Men and Women, who constantly lay wait to lead astray the young and unwary that are possessed of large property, such might here have the pleasure and satisfaction to make a real Paradise on earth, by illuminating a place that would for ever shine and display their generosity.

Boydell&#x27;s middle-class consumers would have approved of his connection between morality and art.

==Business decline, death, and legacy==
In 1789, the French Revolution broke out and four years later war erupted between Britain and France. Throughout the next tumultuous decade, trade with Europe became increasingly difficult. As Boydell&#x27;s business relied heavily on foreign trade, especially French, his livelihood was threatened. When this market was cut off due to war in 1793, Boydell&#x27;s business declined substantially. He was forced to sell the Shakespeare Gallery, via a lottery, in order for his business to remain solvent. He died in December 1804 before the lottery was drawn, but after all of its 22,000 tickets had been sold.

According to Josiah, John Boydell caught a cold by going to the Old Bailey on a damp, foggy day to do his duty as an alderman. He died on 12 December 1804 almost bankrupt, but not without great public acclaim. He was buried on 19 December 1804 at the Church of St. Olave Old Jewry, his funeral attended by the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and several artists.

Boydell had, almost single-handedly, made British prints a viable economic commodity and had demolished the French domination of the trade. In a letter to Sir John Anderson, asking Parliament for the private Lottery Act to sell off the Shakespeare Gallery, Boydell stated that it was &quot;sufficient to say, that the whole course of that commerce [print trade] is changed&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote on 7 May 1789: &quot;Historical painting and engraving are almost exclusively indebted to Mr. Boydell for their present advancement.&quot; Boydell also played a part in changing the nature of art patronage in Britain. Until he advocated public patronage in his various civic posts, the government had little to do with British art. According to Bruntjen, &quot;it was due to the enthusiasm of Boydell and others that the English government eventually provided funds for the establishment of the National Gallery in 1824&quot;. Boydell helped to make artists independent of aristocratic patronage by providing commercial opportunities for them. He &quot;attempted to free artists from the traditional forms of state and aristocratic patronage by creating a public taste for reproductive prints of historical subjects&quot;. Boydell&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; ends with the assessment that &quot;no print publisher before or since has ever exerted as much influence on the course of British art&quot;.

Boydell&#x27;s nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell, continued his uncle&#x27;s business for some time at 90 Cheapside, but by 1818, the business was wound up by Jane Boydell, and the assets purchased by Hurst, Robinson, and Co.

<text>Lucia Elizabeth Vestris (&quot;née&quot; Elizabetta Lucia Bartolozzi; 3 March 1797 – 8 August 1856) was a British actress and a contralto opera singer, appearing in works by Mozart and Rossini, among others. While popular in her time, she was more notable as a theatre producer and manager. After accumulating a fortune from her performances, she leased the Olympic Theatre in London and produced a series of burlesques and extravaganzas, especially popular works by James Planché, for which the house became famous. She also produced his work at other theatres she managed.

==Early life and education==
She was born in London in 1797, the first of the two daughters of German pianist Theresa Jansen Bartolozzi and Italian art dealer Gaetano Stefano Bartolozzi. Her father was a musician and a son of immigrant artist Francesco Bartolozzi who had made his name as an engraver, being appointed as Royal Engraver to the king. Gaetano Bartolozzi was a successful art dealer, and the family moved to Europe in 1798 when he sold off his business. They spent time in Paris and Vienna before reaching Venice, where they found that their estate had been looted during the French invasion. They returned to London to start over, where Gaetano found a new venture which is to teach drawing. On the other hand, his wife Therese gave piano lessons to support her daughters.

Lucia studied music and was noted for her voice and dancing ability. She was married at age 16 to the French ballet dancer, Auguste Armand Vestris, a scion of the great family of dancers of Florentine origin, but her husband deserted her for another woman and left for Naples four years later. Nevertheless, since she had started singing and acting professionally as &quot;Madame Vestris&quot;, she retained the stage name throughout her career.

==Career==

In 1815, at age 18, her contralto voice and attractive appearance gained Madame Vestris her first leading role in Italian opera in the title-role of Peter Winter&#x27;s &quot;II ratto di Proserpina&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre. She also sang in 1816 in Martín y Soler&#x27;s &quot;Una cosa rara&quot; and performed the roles of Dorabella and Susanna in Mozart&#x27;s operas &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. She had immediate success in both London and Paris. In the French capital city she occasionally appeared at the Théâtre-Italien and various other theatres. A legend that she performed as a tragic actress at the Théâtre-Français playing Camille opposite François-Joseph Talma in Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Horace&quot; has however turned out to be untrue. The mistake was the result of a misreading of Talma&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; wherein the actor narrates an episode in 1790 in which a &#x27;Madame Vestris&#x27;, not Eliza Lucia Vestris who was born several years later, but Françoise-Marie-Rosette Gourgaud, the wife of Angiolo Vestris, and thus a great-aunt-in-law of Eliza Lucia&#x27;s husband, was once scandalized by Talma&#x27;s showing up bare-legged on stage in an unusually realistic ancient-Roman costume. The legend was first stated in 1847, when Madame Vestris was still alive, by Thomas Marshall in his book on British actors and actresses, and, after being almost held up to ridicule by John Westland Marston in 1888, it was on the contrary taken as true by Joseph Knight in his article on Madame Vestris in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, and has since been regularly revived by the main following encyclopaedical sources. Finally, the legend has been refuted by modern biographers of Madame Vestris.

Her first hits in English were in 1820 at age 23 at the Drury Lane in Stephen Storace&#x27;s &quot;Siege of Belgrade&quot;, and in Moncrieff&#x27;s burlesque &quot;Giovanni in London&quot;, where she performed the male title-role of no less than Don Giovanni: the &quot;succès de scandale&quot; of this breeches performance in which she showed off her fabulously perfect legs, launched her career as a scandalous beauty. From then on she remained an extraordinary favourite in opera, musical farces, and comedies until her retirement in 1854. At the King&#x27;s Theatre she sang in the English premieres of many Rossini operas, sometimes conducted by the composer himself: &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; (as Pippo, 1821), &quot;La donna del lago&quot; (as Malcolm Groeme, 1823), &quot;Ricciardo e Zoraide&quot; (as Zomira, 1823), &quot;Matilde di Shabran&quot; (as Edoardo, 1823), &quot;Zelmira&quot; (as Emma, 1824), and &quot;Semiramide&quot; (as Arsace, 1824). She excelled in &quot;breeches parts,&quot; and she also performed in Mozart operas, such as &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (Blonde) in 1827, and later, in 1842, &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (Cherubino), in a complete specially crafted English version by James Planché. She was credited with popularizing such new songs as &quot;Cherry Ripe&quot;, &quot;Meet Me by Moonlight Alone&quot; (written by Joseph Augustine Wade), &quot;I&#x27;ve been roaming,&quot; etc. She also took part in world premieres, creating the role of Felix in Isaac Nathan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;The Alcaid or The Secrets of Office&quot;, (London, Little Theatre in the Haymarket, 1824), and, above all, that of Fatima in &quot;Oberon or The Elf King&#x27;s Oath&quot;, &quot;the Grand Romantic and Fairy Opera&quot; by Carl Maria von Weber, which was staged at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden on 12 April 1826.

Despite her celebrity status and popularity, Madame Vestries was not met with total social acceptance for her breeches roles. Her revolutionary action as an actress spurred vicious attacks on her character by her more conservative contemporaries. Vestries&#x27; risqué activities onstage were taken to be representative of her own lack of morality and social purity. Disregarding public backlash, Madame Vestries found great financial achievement with her breeches roles and gained the ability to take a position of power within the theatre industry.

Women did not have as much influence over theatrical production as men, including the roles of management, ownership and administration. Though women had the experience and qualifications from past family ventures they were often not able to secure funding enough to finance their ventures in the capital-intensive industry. When Covent Garden management sought to reduce the acting payroll in 1830, however Vestris had accumulated a fortune from performing and was able to lease the Olympic Theatre from John Scott. There she began presenting a series of burlesques and extravaganzas—for which she made this house famous. She produced numerous works by the contemporary playwright James Planché, with whom she had a successful partnership, which included him contributing ideas for staging and costumes.

==Second marriage and subsequent career==

She married in 1838 for the second time, to the British actor and former associate Charles James Mathews, just before leaving on tour with him for America. They cooperated in their subsequent managerial ventures, including the management of the Lyceum Theatre and the theatre in Covent Garden.

Mme Vestris and Mathews inaugurated their management of Covent Garden with the first-known production of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; since 1605; Vestris played Rosaline. In 1840 she staged one of the first relatively uncut productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, in which she played Oberon. This began a tradition of female Oberons that lasted in the British theatre for seventy years.

In 1841 Vestris produced the highly successful Victorian farce &quot;London Assurance&quot; by Dion Boucicault, with possibly the first use of a &quot;box set&quot;. The play has been popular ever since, receiving its most recent revival at the National Theatre in 2010.

She also introduced the soprano Adelaide Kemble to the theatre in English versions of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and Mercadante&#x27;s &quot;Elena da Feltre&quot; (renamed &quot;Elena Uberti&quot;). A daughter of John Kemble, actor-manager, and one of the theatre&#x27;s owners, and niece of Sarah Siddons, Adelaide had a sensational but short career before retiring into marriage.
About her time in charge at Covent Garden, a note by the actor James Robertson Anderson reported in C.J. Mathews&#x27;s autobiography, says:

Madame was an admirable manager, and Charles an amiable assistant. The arrangements behind the scenes were perfect, the dressing rooms good, the attendants well-chosen, the wings kept clear of all intruders, no strangers or crutch and toothpick loafers allowed behind to flirt with the ballet-girls, only a very few private friends were allowed the privilege of visiting the green-room, which was as handsomely furnished as any nobleman&#x27;s drawing-room, and those friends appeared always in evening dress...There was great propriety and decorum observed in every part of the establishment, great harmony, general content prevailed in every department of the theatre, and universal regret was felt when the admirable managers were compelled to resign their government.

Another contemporary actor George Vandenhoff in &quot;Dramatic Reminiscences&quot; also bears testimony to the fact that: ‘To Vestris&#x27;s honour, she was not only scrupulously careful not to offend propriety by word or action, but she knew very well how to repress any attempt at double-entendre, or doubtful insinuation, in others. The green-room in Covent Garden was a most agreeable lounging place, from which was banished every word or allusion that would not be tolerated in a drawing-room.’

In the late 1840s Vestris began to appear less and less on the stage because of the debts she and her husband owed and also because she began to raise her late sister&#x27;s children. Her last performance (1854) was for Mathews&#x27; benefit, in an adaptation of Madame de Girardin&#x27;s &quot;La Joie fait peur&quot;, called &quot;Sunshine through Clouds&quot;. She died on 8 August 1856 at her home in Fulham, Grove Lodge.

Her musical accomplishments and education were not sufficient to distinguish her in grand opera, and in high comedy she was only moderately successful. But in plays like &quot;Loan of a Lover&quot;, &quot;Paul Pry&quot;, &quot;Naval Engagements&quot;, etc., she was &quot;delightfully arch and bewitching.&quot; However, many an observer (and Chorley among them) &quot;never quite forgave her for not becoming the greatest English operatic contralto of her age:&quot;

In an age where women were denied autonomy, and brought up to believe they could not manage their own lives and their own money, let alone run a business employing hundreds of people including both men and women, Vestris was a business-woman par excellence. She managed theatres; took plays on tour with a motley crew of actors, actresses and all the support staff; and only remarried, after her disastrous early experience with Vestris, when forced to by American authorities in order to allow her to bring her tour across their borders. Lucia Elizabeth Vestris was a prominent figure in the history of British theatre and customs in the nineteenth century.

She is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

<doc id="220619" wikidata="Q29073" url="?curid=220619" title="Gaétan Vestris">
<text>Gaetano Apolline Baldassarre Vestris (18 April 1729 – 23 September 1808), French ballet dancer, was born in Florence and made his debut at the opera in 1749.

==Life==
Born of an Italian theatrical family, he studied dance with Louis Dupré at the Royal Academy in Paris, later joining the Paris Opéra where he served as dancing master to Louis XVI. Vestris was the first dancer to discard the mask and to use his face in mime. 

By 1751, his success and his vanity had grown to such a point that he is reported to have said, &quot;There are but three great men in Europe—the king of Prussia, Voltaire and I.&quot; He was an excellent mimic as well as dancer. From 1770 to 1776 he was a master and composer of ballets, retiring, in favour of Jean Georges Noverre, with a pension.

Vestris married his former rival, dancer Anna Heinel (1753–1808), in 1792. She was of German origin and had wonderful success at the Paris Opera Ballet. They had a son, Adolphe, in 1791. He reappeared at the age of seventy-one on the occasion of his grandson&#x27;s debut.

==Family==
Gaetano had several children who also became dancers. He was the lover of French ballerina Marie Allard and their son Auguste Vestris (1760–1842) was also considered the greatest male dancer of his time. 
Auguste made his debut at 12 with the Paris Opéra and was the company&#x27;s leading dancer for 36 years. Auguste&#x27;s son, Auguste Armand Vestris (1788–1825), husband of Lucia Elizabeth Vestris, took to the same profession and made his debut at the opera in 1800, but left Paris for England, Italy and Vienna never reappearing in France. Gaetano&#x27;s brother, Angiolo Vestris (1730–1809), formerly a dancer and later an actor at the Comédie-Italienne, married Marie Rose Gourgaud, the sister of the actor Dugazon. Gaetano and Angiolo&#x27;s sister, Thérèse (1726-1808), was also a dancer.

<doc id="220625" wikidata="Q752470" url="?curid=220625" title="Orthodox Church of Finland">
<text>The Orthodox Church of Finland or Finnish Orthodox Church (; ) is an autonomous Eastern Orthodox archdiocese of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The church has a legal position as a national church in the country, along with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland.

With its roots in the medieval Novgorodian missionary work in Karelia, the Orthodox Church of Finland was a part of the Russian Orthodox Church until 1923. Today the church has three dioceses and 54,895 members in Finland, accounting for almost one percent of the native population of Finland. The parish of Helsinki has the most adherents. There are also 2,700 members living abroad.

==Structure and organization==
Along with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, the Orthodox Church of Finland has a special position in Finnish law. The church is considered to be a Finnish entity of public nature. The external form of the church is regulated by an Act of Parliament, while the spiritual and doctrinal matters of the church are legislated by the central synod of the church. The church has the right to tax its members and corporations owned by its members. Previously under the Russian Orthodox Church, it has been an autonomous Orthodox archdiocese of the Patriarchate of Constantinople since 1923.
The Orthodox Church of Finland is divided into three dioceses (&quot;hiippakunta&quot;), each with a subdivision of parishes (&quot;seurakunta&quot;). There are 21 parishes with 140 priests and 57,613 members in total, of whom 54,895 are in Finland. The number of church members has been steadily growing for several years. A convent and a monastery also operate within the church.

The central legislative organ of the church is the central synod which is formed of:
*the bishops and coadjutor bishops,
*eleven priests
*three cantors
*eighteen laymen and laywomen
The priests and cantors elect their representatives on a diocesan basis, using the plurality election method. The lay representatives are elected indirectly. The nominations for representatives are made by the parish councils which also elect the electors who then elect the lay representatives to the central synod. The central synod elects the bishops and is responsible for the economy and the general doctrine of the church.
The two executive bodies of the church central administration are the synod of bishops, responsible for the doctrinal and foreign affairs of the church, and the church administrative council (&quot;kirkollishallitus&quot;), responsible for day-to-day management of the church.

The parishes are governed by the rector and the parish council, which is elected in a secret election. All full-age members of the parish are eligible to vote and to be elected to the parish council. The members of the parish have the right to refrain from being elected to a position of trust of the parish only if they are over 60 years of age, or have served at least eight years in a position of trust. The parish council elects the parish board, which is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the parish.

Financially, the church is independent of the state budget. The parishes are financed by the taxes paid by their members. The central administration is financed through the contributions of the parishes. The central synod decides yearly the amount of contributions the parishes are required to make.
The special status of the Orthodox church is most visible in the administrative processes. The church is required to conform with the general administrative law and the decisions of its bodies may be appealed against in the regional administrative courts. However, the court is limited to reviewing the formal legality of the decision. It may not overturn an ecclesiastical decision on the basis of its unreasonableness. The decisions of the synod of bishops and the central synod are not subject to the oversight of the administrative courts. In contrast, similar legal oversight of private religious communities is pursued by the district courts.

Finnish law protects the absolute priest–penitent privilege. A bishop, priest or deacon of the church may not divulge information he has heard during confession or spiritual care. The identity of the sinner may not be revealed for any purpose. However, if the priest hears about a crime that is about to be committed, he is responsible for informing the authorities in such manner that privilege is not endangered.

==Dioceses and bishops==
===Diocese of Helsinki===

The Diocese of Helsinki has the most members, over 28,000. The Diocese of Helsinki is the seat of the archbishop. The diocese is divided into three parishes, with 50 priests. The main church of the diocese is Uspenski Cathedral in Helsinki. Characteristic to the diocese is the large number of members who have recently immigrated to Finland, especially in the Helsinki parish where several churches also officiate at the service in foreign languages, including Russian, English, Greek and Romanian.

The current bishop is Archbishop Elia (Wallgren). He was appointed in 2024.

===Diocese of Kuopio and Karelia===
The seat of the Bishop of Kuopio and Karelia is in Kuopio. 

The Diocese of Karelia has 19,000 church members in 5 parishes. The number of priests in the diocese is about 45, and churches and chapels total over 80. The diocese also includes the only Orthodox monasteries in Finland.

The Orthodox Church Museum of Finland also operates in Kuopio.

The current bishop is Metropolitan Arseni (Heikkinen). He was appointed in 2018.

===Diocese of Oulu===
The small Diocese of Oulu has four parishes, the largest of which is Oulu. 

The diocese was established in 1980 and it has 6,000 members. The cathedral of the diocese is the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Oulu. Traditionally, the Skolts, now a small minority of only 300 speakers, have been the earliest Orthodox Christians in the Finnish Lapland. Today, they live predominantly in the Inari parish.

The Diocese of Oulu was founded as part of Archbishop Paul&#x27;s (Olmari) plan to make the Finnish Orthodox Church autocephalous. However, the autocephaly plan has now been abandoned.

The Locum Tenes after Metropolitan Elia`s election as archbishop is Bishop Sergei (Rajapolvi).

==Monasteries==


The only Orthodox Christian monastery in Finland, New Valamo (&quot;Valamon luostari&quot;), is situated in Heinävesi. The only Orthodox Christian convent Lintula Holy Trinity Convent (&quot;Lintulan Pyhän Kolminaisuuden luostari&quot;) is in Palokki, some 10 kilometers away from the monastery. Both were established during World War II when residents of the Karelian and Petsamo monasteries were evacuated from areas ceded to the Soviet Union. With friendly support from the Finnish Orthodox Church, a private Orthodox Brotherhood of Protection of the Mother of God (&quot;Pokrovan veljestö ry&quot;) has operated in Kirkkonummi since 2000, with two permanent members.

==Additional organizations==
The following organizations operate within or on behalf of the Orthodox Church in Finland:

* Fellowship of St. Sergius and St. Herman (&quot;Pyhien Sergein ja Hermanin Veljeskunta&quot;)
* Orthodox Youth Association (&quot;Ortodoksisten nuorten liitto&quot;)
* Orthodox Student Association (&quot;Ortodoksinen opiskelijaliitto&quot;)
* Finnish Association of Orthodox Teachers (&quot;Suomen ortodoksisten opettajien liitto ry&quot;)
* Orthodox Priests&#x27; Association (&quot;Ortodoksisten pappien liitto&quot;)
* Orthodox Cantors&#x27; Association (&quot;Ortodoksisten kanttorien liitto&quot;)
* Finnish Society of Icon Painters (&quot;Suomen ikonimaalarit ry&quot;)
* &quot;Filantropia ry&quot;– Orthodox Church Aid and Foreign Mission society

===Orthodox missions===
The Finnish Orthodox Church established its own missionary organization in 1977 known as the &quot;Ortodoksinen Lähetys ry&quot; (Orthodox Missions). It has mainly been active in eastern Africa. It later merged with OrtAid and formed &quot;Filantropia&quot;.

==Feasts==
The Finnish Orthodox Church is the only Orthodox church that, to comply with national legislation, celebrates Easter according to the Gregorian calendar. (Formerly, also the autonomous Estonian church followed this calendar.) Easter is the greatest feast of church year as it is with other Orthodox churches. Also the Twelve Great Feasts are observed. Other highly observed feasts are:

*Circumcision of Christ and St. Basil the Great, 1 January
*Holy Martyr and Confessor John of Sonkajanranta, 8 March
*St. John of Valaam, 5 June
*Sts. Sergius and Herman of Valaam, 28 June
*Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, 29 June
*Intercession of the Theotokos, 1 October
*Holy Enlighteners of Karelia, Saturday between 31 October – 6 November
*Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, 6 December, which is celebrated as same day as Independence Day of Finland

==Church architecture==
Many Orthodox churches in Finland are small. The few more impressive shrines were built in the 19th century, when Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire, with the Orthodox Christian Emperor as the Grand Duke of Finland. Notable churches in Helsinki from that era are the Uspenski Cathedral (1864) and the Holy Trinity church (1826). The oldest Orthodox church in Finland is the church of Protection of the Theotokos in Lappeenranta from 1782 to 1785.

The Orthodox Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Hamina was completed in 1837. Built in the architectural style of Neoclassicism with some Byzantine-style elements, the exterior was designed in the form of a round-domed temple, while the interior is cruciform. The belfry was built in 1862 in the Neo-Byzantine style. The Orthodox church of Tampere was built in Russian romantic style, with onion style cupolas, and was ready in 1896. The architect of the Russian army, T.U. Jasikov, drew the floor plan. The church was consecrated in 1899 to Saint Alexander Nevsky, a Novgorodian who in 1240 fought against the Catholic Swedes and two years later the Catholic Teutonic Knights with equal success. Emperor Nicholas II donated the bells to this church. The church suffered heavily during the Finnish Civil War in 1918; its reconstruction took many years. After Finland declared its independence, it was re-consecrated to St. Nicholas.

===After Second World War===

After the Second World War, Finland had to cede land to the Soviet Union under Paris Peace Treaties. Almost all Orthodox churches and chapels remained on the Soviet side in Karelia and Petsamo. The Finnish state enacted a special reconstruction law, in which it financed the construction of 14 churches and 44 chapels for the Orthodox church. The churches and chapels were modern in architecture, lacking domes and other features typical to the Orthodox church architecture. This was mandated by the Finnish state which strictly selected the architects. Most reconstruction era churches and chapels are designed by Ilmari Ahonen and Toivo Paatela.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, Karelian-type log churches and chapels were built were built in Finland with some modern exceptions.

From the 1990s, some contemporary churches have been built in large cities and towns.

==History==
Christianity started to spread to Finland from the east in the Orthodox form and from the west in the Catholic form at the latest in the beginning of the 12th century. Some of the earliest excavated crosses in Finland, dating from the 12th century onward, are similar to a type found in Novgorod and Kyiv. Orthodox parishes are believed to have existed as far to the west as Tavastia, the area inhabited by Tavastians in Central Finland.

Some core concepts of the Christian vocabulary in the Finnish language are supposed to be loans from early Russian, which in turn has borrowed them from Mediaeval Greek. These include the words for priest (&quot;pappi&quot;), cross (&quot;risti&quot;) and Bible (&quot;raamattu&quot;). This hypothesis is, however, not unchallenged.

===Clash between Catholicism and Orthodoxy===
In the middle of the 13th century the inevitable clash between the two expanding countries, Sweden and Novgorod, and the two forms of Christianity they represented, took place. The final border between Western and Eastern rulership was drawn in the Peace Treaty of Nöteborg, in 1323. Karelia was definitely ceded to Novgorod and Orthodoxy.

===Karelian monasteries===


The main missionary work fell to the monasteries that cropped up in the wilderness of Karelia. Two monasteries were founded on islands in Lake Ladoga, which became famous some centuries later: the monasteries of Valaam () and Konevsky ().

Karelian and Finnish forests were also populated by spiritually advanced hermits. Often around the hermit&#x27;s hut or skete, there settled other fighters of the good fight of faith, and so a new monastery was founded. One of the most important examples of this process was St. Alexander of Svir () 1449–1533. He was a Karelian who fought the fight of faith for 13 years in Valaam monastery, but finally left it, and in the end founded a monastery at the river of Svir.

===Swedish oppression===

The 17th century was a period of religious fanaticism and many religious wars as the newly emerged Protestant countries fought against countries that remained Catholic or Orthodox. At this time Sweden became a great force, expanding both southward and eastward. In Karelia the Swedish forces destroyed and burnt to the ground the monasteries of Valaam and Konevsky. Monks that did not flee, were killed. Many peasants met the same fate.

Karelians mostly identified themselves with the Russians, and not with the Finns. Karelians rather called the Finns &quot;ruotsalaiset,&quot; which is the Finnish word for Swedes.

The Lutheran state church of Sweden tried to convert the Orthodox population. They were not allowed to obtain priests from Russia, which meant, in the long run, that they did not have priests at all. As Lutheranism was the only legal religion in Sweden, to be Orthodox was difficult on many levels. About two-thirds of the Orthodox population fled to central Russia from the Swedish oppression. They formed the population of Tver Karelia. The Swedish state encouraged Lutheran Finns to occupy the deserted farms in Karelia. This massive flight of Orthodox Finns away from Finland meant that Eastern Orthodoxy was never again the majority religion of any part of Finland. However, in the remoter areas of Eastern Finland and Karelia, like Ilomantsi, the Eastern Orthodox Christianity survived.

===Reunion with the Russian Orthodox Church===
The period of the grandiose expansion of Sweden met its limits in two wars: the Great Northern War which ended in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 and the Hat&#x27;s War (1741–43) with the Treaty of Turku in 1743. Sweden lost all its provinces in the Baltic region, and a portion of eastern Finland to Russia.

The Valaam Monastery was re-established in Lake Ladoga, and a new main church was consecrated in 1719. Monks returned to Konevsky Monastery before 1716. The Russian government favoured the activities of the religion they had professed for many centuries. The Emperors and Empresses paid for the reconstruction of burnt or otherwise demolished churches. The Orthodox population of Eastern Finland again had access to making pilgrimages to the monasteries of Solovetsk and Alexander-Svirsky.

The Old Believers, a schismatic group of Russians who did not accept the religious reforms of patriarch Nikon in 1666–67, were excommunicated from the Orthodox Church and fled to the outskirts of Russia. They also moved into the remote areas of Finland building three small monasteries there. However, the activity of these monasteries stopped during the following century.

===Autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland===

When all of Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire in 1809, it already had an established Lutheran Church. Eastern Orthodox Christianity also gained a recognized status in Finland. The old Swedish constitution which Finns generally regarded as the constitution of the Grand Duchy, specifically required that the sovereign was Protestant, but this was overlooked regarding the Orthodox Emperors.

In areas where Orthodox faith was not indigenous as in the towns of Helsinki, Tampere and Viipuri and the Karelian Isthmus, Orthodoxy was especially associated with the Russians, most of whom were Russian troops permanently stationed in Finland. The birth of Helsinki&#x27;s Orthodox Church is generally associated with the construction of the Holy Trinity Church, Helsinki in 1827. Generally most ecclesiastical activity outside Karelia centered on the garrison churches. There were also a growing number of Russian emigrants, most of whom were merchants or craftsmen. These started to identify themselves with the Swedish-speaking bourgeoisie, and so a Swedish-speaking branch of the Finnish Orthodox Church was born.

The 19th century was also a period of active building of new churches, the Uspenski Cathedral being the most important of them. The garrisons needed Orthodox churches and so did the new emigrants to the towns. A good examples are the Orthodox church of Tampere and Turku.

In the rural countryside of Karelia, the local form of Orthodox faith remained somewhat primitive, incorporating many features of older religious praxis. Literacy among the Orthodox population was low. In 1900 it was estimated that of all persons over the age of 15 in East Finland, 32 percent were illiterate. The Orthodox population knew very little of their faith except the outer forms. The priests were generally Russians who seldom knew Finnish. As Karelia and its arable land was poor, it did not attract first class priests. The language of the services was Church Slavonic, a form of old Bulgarian. A Russian could understand some parts of the services, a Finnish-speaking person nothing.

A separate Finnish episcopate with a leading archbishop was established in 1892 under the Russian Orthodox Church. It was stationed in Vyborg, with the Russian Antoniy as its first bishop.

When Russia at the end of the 19th century tried to retract the autonomy of Finland, the Lutheran Finns started to associate the Orthodox Church with the imperial Russian rule, labeled as the &quot;ryssän kirkko&quot;. The cultural gap between the two churches remained significant.

===Independent Republic of Finland===
Shortly after Finland declared independence from Russia in 1917, the Orthodox Church of Finland declared its autonomy from the Russian Church. Finland&#x27;s first constitution (1919) granted the Orthodox Church an equal status with the (Lutheran) Church of Finland.
In 1923, the Orthodox Church of Finland completely separated from the Russian Church, becoming an autonomous church affiliated with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. At the same time the Gregorian Calendar was adopted. Other reforms introduced after independence include changing the language of the liturgy from Church Slavonic to Finnish and the transfer of the Archiepiscopal seat from Viipuri to Sortavala.

Until World War II, the majority of Orthodox Christians in Finland were located in Karelia. As a consequence of the war, residents of the areas ceded to the Soviet Union were evacuated to other parts of the country. The monastery of Valamo was evacuated in 1940 and the monastery of New Valamo was founded in 1941 at Heinävesi, on the Finnish side of the new border. Later, the monks from Konevsky and Petsamo monasteries also joined the New Valamo monastery. The nunnery of Lintula (now Ogonki) near Kivennapa (Karelian Isthmus) was also evacuated, and re-established at Heinävesi in 1946.
A new parish network was established, and many new churches were built in the 1950s. After the cities of Sortavala and Viipuri were lost to the Soviet Union (Viipuri is now Vyborg, Russia), the archiepiscopal seat was moved to Kuopio and the diocesan seat of Viipuri was moved to Helsinki. A third diocese was established in Oulu in 1979.

After the Second World War the membership of the Orthodox Church in Finland decreased slowly, as the Karelian evacuees were settled far from their roots among the Lutheran majority of Finland. Mixed marriages became common and the children were often baptized into the religion of the majority. But quite unexpectedly a &quot;romantic&quot; movement arose in Finland beginning in the 1970s onward glorifying Orthodoxy, its &quot;mystical&quot; and visually beautiful services and icons (religious paintings) and its deeper view of Christianity than that of the Lutheran Church. For these reasons, similar to Catholicism in England, conversion to the Orthodox Church became almost a fad, and its membership started to grow.

At the same time Archbishop Paavali of Karelia and All Finland (1960–1987) made liturgical changes to the services, that gave the laity a more active role in the church services, and made the services more open (earlier the clergy stayed behind a curtain for part of the services) and intelligible. Archbishop Paavali also stressed the importance of partaking in the Eucharist as often as possible.

In the 2010s, church membership has begun to decrease due to membership resignations and the declining number of baptisms. Compared to the membership trends of the Finnish Lutheran Church, members who resign from the Orthodox Church are on average slightly older and more likely to be female than those resigning from the Lutheran Church.

==Russian Orthodox Church in Finland==

About 3,000 Orthodox Christians in Finland belong to the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), which is not connected to the Orthodox Church of Finland. Unlike the Orthodox Church of Finland, the Russian Orthodox Church in Finland follows the Julian calendar.

* Antoniy (1892–1898)
* Nikolay (1899–1905)
* Sergiy (1905–1917)
* Serafim (1918–1923), Bishop of Finland from 1918 and archbishop from 1921

Under Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople:

<doc id="220627" wikidata="Q939370" url="?curid=220627" title="Jean-Henri Gourgaud">
<text>Jean-Henri Gourgaud (15 November 1746 – 19 October 1809) was a French actor under the stage name Dugazon, the son of Pierre-Antoine Gourgaud, the director of military hospitals there and also an actor.

He began his career in the provinces, making his debut in 1770 at the &quot;Comédie Française&quot;, where he aspired to leading comedy roles. He pleased the public at once and was made &quot;sociétaire&quot; in 1772. Dugazon was an ardent revolutionist, helped the schism which divided the company, and went with Talma and the others to what became the Théâtre de la République. After the closing of this theatre and the dissolution of the Comédie Française, he took refuge at the Théâtre Feydeau until he returned to the restored &quot;Comédie&quot; in 1799. He retired in 1805, and died insane at Sandillon.

Dugazon wrote three comedies of a political character, performed at the Théâtre de la République. He married, in 1776, Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre, but was soon divorced and then married again. Together they had a child, composer Gustave Dugazon.

Dugazon&#x27;s sister, Marie Rose Gourgaud (1743–1804), was an actress who first played at Stuttgart, where she married Angelo Vestris, brother of Gaétano Vestris, the dancer. Under the protection of the dukes of Choiseul and Duras, she was commanded to make her debut at the Comédie Française in 1768, where she created important parts in a number of tragedies.

<text>In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation (also dynamic translation or run-time compilations) is compilation (of computer code) during execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution. This may consist of source code translation but is more commonly bytecode translation to machine code, which is then executed directly. A system implementing a JIT compiler typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or recompilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code.

JIT compilation is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code—ahead-of-time compilation (AOT), and interpretation—and combines some advantages and drawbacks of both. Roughly, JIT compilation combines the speed of compiled code with the flexibility of interpretation, with the overhead of an interpreter and the additional overhead of compiling and linking (not just interpreting). JIT compilation is a form of dynamic compilation, and allows adaptive optimization such as dynamic recompilation and microarchitecture-specific speedups. Interpretation and JIT compilation are particularly suited for dynamic programming languages, as the runtime system can handle late-bound data types and enforce security guarantees.

== History ==

The earliest published JIT compiler is generally attributed to work on LISP by John McCarthy in 1960. In his seminal paper &quot;Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I&quot;, he mentions functions that are translated during runtime, thereby sparing the need to save the compiler output to punch cards (although this would be more accurately known as a &quot;Compile and go system&quot;). Another early example was by Ken Thompson, who in 1968 gave one of the first applications of regular expressions, here for pattern matching in the text editor QED. For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by JITing to IBM 7094 code on the Compatible Time-Sharing System. An influential technique for deriving compiled code from interpretation was pioneered by James G. Mitchell in 1970, which he implemented for the experimental language &quot;LC²&quot;.

Smalltalk (c. 1983) pioneered new aspects of JIT compilations. For example, translation to machine code was done on demand, and the result was cached for later use. When memory became scarce, the system would delete some of this code and regenerate it when it was needed again. Sun&#x27;s Self language improved these techniques extensively and was at one point the fastest Smalltalk system in the world, achieving up to half the speed of optimized C but with a fully object-oriented language.

Self was abandoned by Sun, but the research went into the Java language. The term &quot;Just-in-time compilation&quot; was borrowed from the manufacturing term &quot;Just in time&quot; and popularized by Java, with James Gosling using the term from 1993. Currently JITing is used by most implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, as HotSpot builds on, and extensively uses, this research base.

The HP project Dynamo was an experimental JIT compiler where the &quot;bytecode&quot; format and the machine code format were the same; the system optimized PA-8000 machine code. Counterintuitively, this resulted in speed ups, in some cases of 30% since doing this permitted optimizations at the machine code level, for example, inlining code for better cache usage and optimizations of calls to dynamic libraries and many other run-time optimizations which conventional compilers are not able to attempt.

In November 2020, PHP 8.0 introduced a JIT compiler. In October 2024, CPython introduced an experimental JIT compiler.

== Design ==

In a bytecode-compiled system, source code is translated to an intermediate representation known as bytecode. Bytecode is not the machine code for any particular computer, and may be portable among computer architectures. The bytecode may then be interpreted by, or run on a virtual machine. The JIT compiler reads the bytecodes in many sections (or in full, rarely) and compiles them dynamically into machine code so the program can run faster. This can be done per-file, per-function or even on any arbitrary code fragment; the code can be compiled when it is about to be executed (hence the name &quot;just-in-time&quot;), and then cached and reused later without needing to be recompiled.

By contrast, a traditional &quot;interpreted virtual machine&quot; will simply interpret the bytecode, generally with much lower performance. Some &quot;interpreter&quot;s even interpret source code, without the step of first compiling to bytecode, with even worse performance. &quot;Statically-compiled code&quot; or &quot;native code&quot; is compiled prior to deployment. A &quot;dynamic compilation environment&quot; is one in which the compiler can be used during execution. A common goal of using JIT techniques is to reach or surpass the performance of static compilation, while maintaining the advantages of bytecode interpretation: Much of the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of parsing the original source code and performing basic optimization is often handled at compile time, prior to deployment: compilation from bytecode to machine code is much faster than compiling from source. The deployed bytecode is portable, unlike native code. Since the runtime has control over the compilation, like interpreted bytecode, it can run in a secure sandbox. Compilers from bytecode to machine code are easier to write, because the portable bytecode compiler has already done much of the work.

JIT code generally offers far better performance than interpreters. In addition, it can in some cases offer better performance than static compilation, as many optimizations are only feasible at run-time:

# The compilation can be optimized to the targeted CPU and the operating system model where the application runs. For example, JIT can choose SSE2 vector CPU instructions when it detects that the CPU supports them. To obtain this level of optimization specificity with a static compiler, one must either compile a binary for each intended platform/architecture, or else include multiple versions of portions of the code within a single binary.
# The system is able to collect statistics about how the program is actually running in the environment it is in, and it can rearrange and recompile for optimum performance. However, some static compilers can also take profile information as input.
# The system can do global code optimizations (e.g. inlining of library functions) without losing the advantages of dynamic linking and without the overheads inherent to static compilers and linkers. Specifically, when doing global inline substitutions, a static compilation process may need run-time checks and ensure that a virtual call would occur if the actual class of the object overrides the inlined method, and boundary condition checks on array accesses may need to be processed within loops. With just-in-time compilation in many cases this processing can be moved out of loops, often giving large increases of speed.
# Although this is possible with statically compiled garbage collected languages, a bytecode system can more easily rearrange executed code for better cache utilization.

Because a JIT must render and execute a native binary image at runtime, true machine-code JITs necessitate platforms that allow for data to be executed at runtime, making using such JITs on a Harvard architecture-based machine impossible; the same can be said for certain operating systems and virtual machines as well. However, a special type of &quot;JIT&quot; may potentially &quot;not&quot; target the physical machine&#x27;s CPU architecture, but rather an optimized VM bytecode where limitations on raw machine code prevail, especially where that bytecode&#x27;s VM eventually leverages a JIT to native code.

== Performance ==

JIT causes a slight to noticeable delay in the initial execution of an application, due to the time taken to load and compile the input code. Sometimes this delay is called &quot;startup time delay&quot; or &quot;warm-up time&quot;. In general, the more optimization JIT performs, the better the code it will generate, but the initial delay will also increase. A JIT compiler therefore has to make a trade-off between the compilation time and the quality of the code it hopes to generate. Startup time can include increased IO-bound operations in addition to JIT compilation: for example, the &quot;rt.jar&quot; class data file for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is 40 MB and the JVM must seek a lot of data in this contextually huge file.

One possible optimization, used by Sun&#x27;s HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, is to combine interpretation and JIT compilation. The application code is initially interpreted, but the JVM monitors which sequences of bytecode are frequently executed and translates them to machine code for direct execution on the hardware. For bytecode which is executed only a few times, this saves the compilation time and reduces the initial latency; for frequently executed bytecode, JIT compilation is used to run at high speed, after an initial phase of slow interpretation. Additionally, since a program spends most time executing a minority of its code, the reduced compilation time is significant. Finally, during the initial code interpretation, execution statistics can be collected before compilation, which helps to perform better optimization.

The correct tradeoff can vary due to circumstances. For example, Sun&#x27;s Java Virtual Machine has two major modes—client and server. In client mode, minimal compilation and optimization is performed, to reduce startup time. In server mode, extensive compilation and optimization is performed, to maximize performance once the application is running by sacrificing startup time. Other Java just-in-time compilers have used a runtime measurement of the number of times a method has executed combined with the bytecode size of a method as a heuristic to decide when to compile. Still another uses the number of times executed combined with the detection of loops. In general, it is much harder to accurately predict which methods to optimize in short-running applications than in long-running ones.

Native Image Generator (Ngen) by Microsoft is another approach at reducing the initial delay. Ngen pre-compiles (or &quot;pre-JITs&quot;) bytecode in a Common Intermediate Language image into machine native code. As a result, no runtime compilation is needed. .NET Framework 2.0 shipped with Visual Studio 2005 runs Ngen on all of the Microsoft library DLLs right after the installation. Pre-jitting provides a way to improve the startup time. However, the quality of code it generates might not be as good as the one that is JITed, for the same reasons why code compiled statically, without profile-guided optimization, cannot be as good as JIT compiled code in the extreme case: the lack of profiling data to drive, for instance, inline caching.

There also exist Java implementations that combine an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler with either a JIT compiler (Excelsior JET) or interpreter (GNU Compiler for Java).

JIT compilation may not reliably achieve its goal, namely entering a steady state of improved performance after a short initial warmup period. Across eight different virtual machines, measured six widely-used microbenchmarks which are commonly used by virtual machine implementors as optimisation targets, running them repeatedly within a single process execution. On Linux, they found that 8.7% to 9.6% of process executions failed to reach a steady state of performance, 16.7% to 17.9% entered a steady state of &quot;reduced&quot; performance after a warmup period, and 56.5% pairings of a specific virtual machine running a specific benchmark failed to consistently see a steady-state non-degradation of performance across multiple executions (i.e., at least one execution failed to reach a steady state or saw reduced performance in the steady state). Even where an improved steady-state was reached, it sometimes took many hundreds of iterations. instead focused on the HotSpot virtual machine but with a much wider array of benchmarks, finding that 10.9% of process executions failed to reach a steady state of performance, and 43.5% of benchmarks did not consistently attain a steady state across multiple executions.

== Security ==

JIT compilation fundamentally uses executable data, and thus poses security challenges and possible exploits.

Implementation of JIT compilation consists of compiling source code or byte code to machine code and executing it. This is generally done directly in memory: the JIT compiler outputs the machine code directly into memory and immediately executes it, rather than outputting it to disk and then invoking the code as a separate program, as in usual ahead of time compilation. In modern architectures this runs into a problem due to executable space protection: arbitrary memory cannot be executed, as otherwise there is a potential security hole. Thus memory must be marked as executable; for security reasons this should be done &quot;after&quot; the code has been written to memory, and marked read-only, as writable/executable memory is a security hole (see W^X). For instance Firefox&#x27;s JIT compiler for Javascript introduced this protection in a release version with Firefox 46.

JIT spraying is a class of computer security exploits that use JIT compilation for heap spraying: the resulting memory is then executable, which allows an exploit if execution can be moved into the heap.

== Uses ==
JIT compilation can be applied to some programs, or can be used for certain capacities, particularly dynamic capacities such as regular expressions. For example, a text editor may compile a regular expression provided at runtime to machine code to allow faster matching: this cannot be done ahead of time, as the pattern is only provided at runtime. Several modern runtime environments rely on JIT compilation for high-speed code execution, including most implementations of Java, together with Microsoft&#x27;s .NET. Similarly, many regular-expression libraries feature JIT compilation of regular expressions, either to bytecode or to machine code. JIT compilation is also used in some emulators, in order to translate machine code from one CPU architecture to another.

A common implementation of JIT compilation is to first have AOT compilation to bytecode (virtual machine code), known as &quot;bytecode compilation&quot;, and then have JIT compilation to machine code (dynamic compilation), rather than interpretation of the bytecode. This improves the runtime performance compared to interpretation, at the cost of lag due to compilation. JIT compilers translate continuously, as with interpreters, but caching of compiled code minimizes lag on future execution of the same code during a given run. Since only part of the program is compiled, there is significantly less lag than if the entire program were compiled prior to execution.

<text>The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place at which a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt, as proof of transaction, which is usually printed but can also be dispensed with or sent electronically.

To calculate the amount owed by a customer, the merchant may use various devices such as weighing scales, barcode scanners, and cash registers (or the more advanced &quot;POS cash registers&quot;, which are sometimes also called &quot;POS systems&quot;). To make a payment, payment terminals, touch screens, and other hardware and software options are available.

The point of sale is often referred to as the point of service because it is not just a point of sale but also a point of return or customer order. POS terminal software may also include features for additional functionality, such as inventory management, CRM, financials, or warehousing.

Businesses are increasingly adopting POS systems, and one of the most obvious and compelling reasons is that a POS system eliminates the need for price tags. Selling prices are linked to the product code of an item when adding stock, so the cashier merely scans this code to process a sale. If there is a price change, this can also be easily done through the inventory window. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control. These features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems.

==Terminology==

Retailers and marketers will often refer to the area around the checkout instead as the point of purchase (POP) when they are discussing it from the customer&#x27;s perspective. This is particularly the case when planning and designing the area as well as when considering a marketing strategy and offers.

Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as &quot;retail management system&quot; which is a more appropriate term, since this software is not just for processing sales but comes with many other capabilities, such as inventory management, membership systems, supplier records, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlet networking or linkage, to name some major ones.

Nevertheless, it is the term &quot;POS system&quot; rather than &quot;retail management system&quot; that is in vogue among both end-users and vendors.

The basic, fundamental definition of a POS System is a system which allows the processing and recording of transactions between a company and its consumers, at the time in which goods and/or services are purchased.

==History==

===Software before the 1990s===

Early electronic cash registers (ECR) were controlled with proprietary software and were limited in function and communication capability. In August 1973, IBM released the IBM 3650 and 3660 store systems that were, in essence, a mainframe computer used as a store controller that could control up to 128 IBM 3653/3663 point of sale registers. This system was the first commercial use of client-server technology, peer-to-peer communications, local area network (LAN) simultaneous backup, and remote initialization. By mid-1974, it was installed in Pathmark stores in New Jersey and Dillard&#x27;s department stores.

One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants. It used the Intel 8008, an early microprocessor (forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, [2] Vanilla Shake, [1] Large Fries, [3] BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item. By pressing the [Grill] button, a second or third order could be worked on while the first transaction was in progress. When the customer was ready to pay, the [Total] button would calculate the bill, including sales tax for almost any jurisdiction in the United States. This made it accurate for McDonald&#x27;s and very convenient for the servers and provided the restaurant owner with a check on the amount that should be in the cash drawers. Up to eight devices were connected to one of two interconnected computers so that printed reports, prices, and taxes could be handled from any desired device by putting it into &quot;Manager Mode&quot;. In addition to the error-correcting memory, accuracy was enhanced by having three copies of all important data with many numbers stored only as multiples of 3. Should one computer fail, the other could handle the entire store.
In 1986, Gene Mosher introduced the first graphical point of sale software featuring a touchscreen interface under the ViewTouch trademark on the 16-bit Atari 520ST color computer. It featured a color touchscreen widget-driven interface that allowed configuration of widgets representing menu items without low level programming. The ViewTouch point of sale software was first demonstrated in public at Fall Comdex, 1986, in Las Vegas Nevada to large crowds visiting the Atari Computer booth. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the US and Canada.

In 1986, IBM introduced its 468x series of POS equipment based on Digital Research&#x27;s Concurrent DOS 286 and FlexOS 1.xx, a modular real-time multi-tasking multi-user operating system.

===Modern software (post-1990s)===
A wide range of POS applications have been developed on platforms such as Windows and Unix. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems. Cost of such systems has also declined, as all the components can now be purchased off-the-shelf.

In 1993, IBM adopted FlexOS 2.32 as the basis of their IBM 4690 OS in their 469x series of POS terminals. This was developed up to 2014 when it was sold to Toshiba, who continued to support it up to at least 2017.

With increased options for commodity hardware and a more competitive market, the 1990s saw increased attention paid to the user interaction between store employees and POS systems. Touchscreens and larger displays became widely available in the 1990s, offering an alternative to limited displays like two-line VFDs used in the IBM 4683. The performance of the employees using the POS devices, a controllable cost for the business, depends upon the ease of learning, ease of use, and level of employee experience with it. Although experienced employees work more quickly with mechanically keyed entry, some systems favoured adopting GUI technology for ease of learning or for ergonomic factors.

The key requirements that must be met by modern POS systems include high and consistent operating speed, reliability, ease of use, remote supportability, low cost, and rich functionality. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane.

Reliability depends not wholly on the developer but at times on the compatibility between a database and an OS version. For example, the widely used Microsoft Access database system had a compatibility issue when Windows XP machines were updated to a newer version of Windows. Microsoft offered no immediate solution. Some businesses were severely disrupted in the process, and many downgraded back to Windows XP for a quick resolution. Other companies utilized community support, for a registry tweak solution has been found for this.

POS systems are one of the most complex software systems available because of the features that are required by different end users. Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules. Sometimes purchase ordering, stock transferring, quotation issuing, barcode creating, bookkeeping or even accounting capabilities are included. Each of these modules is interlinked if they are to serve their practical purpose and maximize their usability.

For instance, the sale window is immediately updated on a new member entry through the membership window because of this interlinking. Similarly, when a sale transaction is made, any purchase by a member is on record for the membership window to report providing information like payment type, goods purchased, date of purchase and points accumulated. Comprehensive analysis performed by a POS machine may need to process several qualities about a single product, like selling price, balance, average cost, quantity sold, description and department. Highly complex programming is involved (and possibly considerable computer resources) to generate such extensive analyses.

POS systems are designed not only to serve the retail, wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case. Currently POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.

Different customers have different expectations within each trade. The reporting functionality alone is subject to so many demands, especially from those in the retail/wholesale industry. To cite special requirements, some business&#x27;s goods may include perishables and hence the inventory system must be capable of prompting the admin and cashier on expiring or expired products. Some retail businesses require the system to store credit for their customers, credit which can be used subsequently to pay for goods. A few companies expect the POS system to behave like a full-fledged inventory management system, including the ability to provide FIFO (First In First Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out), reports of their goods for accounting and tax purposes.

In the hospitality industry, POS system capabilities can also diverge significantly. For instance, a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions: whether it has functionality such as creating item buttons, various discounts, adding a service charge, holding of receipts, queuing, table service as well as takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt. These capabilities may be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require, in addition, a scheduling window with historical records of customers&#x27; attendance and their special requirements.

A POS system can be made to serve different purposes to different end users depending on their business processes. Often an off-the-shelf POS system is inadequate for customers. Some customization is required, and this is why a POS system can become very complex. The complexity of a mature POS system extends to remote networking or interlinking between remote outlets and the HQ such that updating both ways is possible. Some POS systems offer the linking of web-based orders to their sale window. Even when local networking is only required (as in the case of a high-traffic supermarket), there is the ever-present challenge for the developer to keep most if not all of their POS stations running. This puts high demand not just on software coding but also designing the whole system covering how individual stations and the network work together, and special consideration for the performance capability and usage of databases. Due to such complexity, bugs and errors encountered in POS systems are frequent.

With regard to databases, POS systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data - required for correct sequencing the receipt number, checking various discounts, membership, calculating subtotal, so forth - just to process a single sale transaction. The immediacy required of the system on the sale window such as may be observed at a checkout counter in a supermarket cannot be compromised. This places much stress on individual enterprise databases if there are just several tens of thousands of sale records in the database. Enterprise database Microsoft SQL Server, for example, has been known to freeze up (including the OS) entirely for many minutes under such conditions showing a &quot;Timeout Expired&quot; error message. Even a lighter database like Microsoft Access will slow to a crawl over time if the problem of database bloating is not foreseen and managed by the system automatically. Therefore, the need to do extensive testing, debugging and improvisation of solutions to preempt failure of a database before commercial implementation complicates the development.

POS system accuracy is demanding, given that monetary transactions are involved continuously not only via the sale window but also at the back end through the receiving and inputting of goods into the inventory. Calculations required are not always straightforward. There may be many discounts and deals that are unique to specific products, and the POS machine must quickly process the differences and the effect on pricing. There is much complexity in the programming of such operations, especially when no error in calculation can be allowed.

Other requirements include that the system must have functionality for membership discount and points accumulation/usage, quantity and promotional discounts, mix and match offers, cash rounding up, invoice/delivery-order issuance with outstanding amount. It should enable a user to adjust the inventory of each product based on physical count, track expiry of perishable goods, change pricing, provide audit trail when modification of inventory records is performed, be capable of multiple outlet functionality, control of stocks from HQ, doubling as an invoicing system, just to name some.

It is clear that POS system is a term that implies a wide range of capabilities depending on the end-user requirements. POS system review websites cannot be expected to cover most let alone all the features. Unless one is a developer, it is unrealistic to expect the reviewer to know all the aspects of a POS system. For instance, a POS system might work smoothly on a test database during the review but not when the database grows significantly in size over months of usage. And this is only one among many hidden critical functionality issues of a POS system.

===Hardware interface standardization (post-1980s)===
Vendors and retailers are working to standardize development of computerized POS systems and simplify interconnecting POS devices. Two such initiatives were OPOS and JavaPOS, both of which conform to the UnifiedPOS standard led by The National Retail Foundation.

OPOS (OLE for POS) was the first commonly adopted standard and was created by Microsoft, NCR Corporation, Epson and Fujitsu-ICL. OPOS is a COM-based interface compatible with all COM-enabled programming languages for Microsoft Windows. OPOS was first released in 1996. JavaPOS was developed by Sun Microsystems, IBM, and NCR Corporation in 1997 and first released in 1999. JavaPOS is for Java what OPOS is for Windows, and thus largely platform independent.

There are several communication ways POS systems use to control peripherals such as:
* Logic Controls \ BemaTech
* Epson Esc/POS
* UTC Standard
* UTC Enhanced
* AEDEX
* ICD 2002
* Ultimate
* CD 5220
* DSP-800
* ADM 787/788
* HP

There are also nearly as many proprietary protocols as there are companies making POS peripherals. Most POS peripherals, such as displays and printers, support several of these command protocols to work with many different brands of POS terminals and computers.

==User interface design==
The design of the sale window is the most important one for the user. This user interface is highly critical when compared to those in other software packages such as word editors or spreadsheet programs where the speed of navigation is not so crucial for business performance.

For businesses at prime locations where real estate is at a premium, it can be common to see a queue of customers. The faster a sale is completed the shorter the queue time which improves customer satisfaction, the less space it takes, which benefits shoppers and staff. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn&#x27;t distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.

Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.

==Cloud-based (post-2000s)==
The advent of cloud computing has given birth to the possibility of electronic point of sale (EPOS) systems to be deployed as software as a service, which can be accessed directly from the Internet using a web browser. Using the previous advances in the communication protocols for POS&#x27;s control of hardware, cloud-based POS systems are independent from platform and operating system limitations. EPOS systems based in the cloud (most small-business POS today) are generally subscription-based, which includes ongoing customer support.

Compared to regular cash registers (which tend to be significantly cheaper but only process sales and prints receipts), POS systems include automatic updating of the inventory library stock levels when selling products, real-time reports accessible from a remote computer, staff timesheets and a customer library with loyalty features.
Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple&#x27;s iPad. Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices, such as tablet computers or smartphones.

These devices can also act as barcode readers using a built-in camera and as payment terminals using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader. A number of POS companies built their software specifically to be cloud-based. Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology.

Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The POS system is also not run locally, so there is no installation required.

Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of fewer bugs and errors.

Other advantages of a cloud-based POS are instant centralization of data (important especially to chain stores), ability to access data from anywhere there is internet connection, and lower start-up costs.

Cloud based POS requires an internet connection. For this reason it important to use a device with 3G connectivity in case the device&#x27;s primary internet goes down. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, a notable strength of cloud-based point of sale systems is the ability to switch to a different product, by a different developer, without having to purchase new hardware. The many developers creating new software applications help to ensure that the system is supported for longer than a typical legacy POS system.

A number of noted emerging cloud-based POS systems came on the scene less than a decade or even half a decade back. These systems are usually designed for restaurants, small and medium-sized retail operations with fairly simple sale processes as can be culled from POS system review sites. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. &quot;Enterprise-level&quot; here means that the inventory should be capable of handling a large number of records, such as required by grocery stores and supermarkets. It can also mean that the system software and cloud server must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation.

POS vendors of such cloud based systems should also have a strong contingency plan for the breakdown of their remote server such as represented by fail-over server support. Sometimes a major data center can fail completely, such as in a fire. On-premises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloud-based implementation to preempt such incidents, especially for businesses with high traffic. The on-premises installations may not have the most up-to-date inventory and membership information.

For such contingency, a more innovative though highly complex approach for the developer is to have a trimmed down version of the POS system installed on the cashier computer at the outlet. On a daily basis the latest inventory and membership information from the remote server is automatically updated into the local database. Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database.

Although cloud-based POS systems save the end-user startup cost and technical challenges in maintaining an otherwise on-premises installation, there is a risk that if the cloud-based vendor closes down it may result in more immediate termination of services for the end-user compared to the case of a traditional full on-premises POS system where it can still run without the vendor.

Another consideration is that a cloud-based POS system actually exposes business data to service providers - the hosting service company and the POS vendor which have access to both the application and database. The importance of securing critical business information such as supplier names, top selling items, customer relationship processes cannot be underestimated given that sometimes the few key success factors or trade secrets of a business are actually accessible through the POS system. This security and privacy concern is an ongoing issue in cloud computing.

==Retail industry==

The retail industry is one of the predominant users of POS terminals. The POS interface at a retail establishment varies greatly depending on the industry and owner of the retailer, but usually includes a cash register (typically a specialized x86-based computer running Windows Embedded or Linux), a method for employee input, cash drawer, receipt printer, barcode scanners (which may incorporate a scale), and an interface for processing Card payments and Processing Customer Information (a Payment Terminal). It can also include a conveyor belt, checkout divider, wireless handheld scanners, integrated card processing systems, and customer-facing displays to display totals and show advertisements. While some systems use typical PC interfaces (such as a keyboard &amp; mouse), it is far more common to utilize touchscreens as they allow for faster response and better customization for the retailer. In the past, most IBM systems used a primarily keyboard-based interface, and NCR previously used side-keys on their displays before touchscreens were widely available, similar to their ATM products. 

The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, gift cards, gift registries, customer loyalty programs, promotions, discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions such as pre-planned promotional sales, manufacturer coupon validation, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.

The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer, but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. The controlling servers, or &quot;Back-office&quot; computers, typically handle other functions of the POS system such as inventory control, pricing, purchasing, receiving and transferring of products to and from other locations. Other typical functions of a POS system are: store sales information for enabling customer returns, reporting purposes, sales trends and cost/price/profit analysis. Customer information may be stored for receivables management, marketing purposes and specific buying analysis. Many retail POS systems include an accounting interface that &quot;feeds&quot; sales and product losses, cash drawer expected totals, and cashier productivity information to independent accounting applications.

A multi-terminal POS system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station is designed to be robust in its operation. Most proprietary POS systems designed for large retailers use 2 servers, with one acting as a backup in case of failure. In the event that both servers fail, the individual POS systems will enter a failsafe mode, where sales data is stored locally and exported back to the servers upon a return of the connection. This may prove challenging to implement in some instances however, as many commercial POS systems do not have any hard disks for security purposes, and often have limited amounts of RAM.

Performing updates between multiple stations and the back end administrative computer should be redundant, so that updates to inventory and promotions will be accurately reflected at checkout without having to restart the computer, and reflecting accurate sales records to the back-end computer at the end of the business day.

This gets even more complicated when there is a membership system requiring real-time two-way updating of membership points between sale stations and the back end administrative computer.

Retail operations such as hardware stores, lumber yards, electronics stores and so-called multifaceted superstores need specialized additional features compared to other stores. POS software in these cases handles special orders, purchase orders, repair orders, service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions. Rugged hardware is required for point of sale systems used in outdoor environments. Wireless devices, battery powered devices, all-in-one units, and Internet-ready machines are typical in this industry.

Recently new applications have been introduced, enabling POS transactions to be conducted using mobile phones and tablets. According to a recent study, mobile POS (mPOS) terminals are expected to replace the contemporary payment techniques because of various features including mobility, upfront low cost investment and better user experience.

In the mid-2000s, the blind community in the United States engaged in structured negotiations to ensure that retail point of sale devices had tactile keypads. Without keys that can be felt, a blind person cannot independently enter his or her PIN. In the mid-2000s retailers began using &quot;flat screen&quot; or &quot;signature capture&quot; devices that eliminated tactile keypads. Blind people were forced to share their confidential PIN with store clerks to use their debit and other PIN-based cards. The blind community reached agreement with Walmart, Target, CVS and eight other retailers that required real physical keys so blind people could use the devices.

===Checkout configuration===
Early stores typically kept merchandise behind a counter. Staff would fetch items for customers to prevent the opportunity for theft and sales would be made at the same counter. Self-service grocery stores such as Piggly Wiggly, beginning in 1916, allowed customers to fetch their own items and pass the point of sale enroute to the exit.

Modern stores have a variety of checkout configurations, but almost all stores will have their main checkout area situated close to the entrance/exits. Smaller stores may utilize simple counters, while big-box stores will typically use a conveyor belt system spaced out in separate &quot;lanes&quot; to process orders. Express lanes might limit the type of payment, or number or type of goods, to expedite service. Some department stores may also have checkouts inside of the departments to allow shoppers of that section to pay without going through the main lines. If each checkout station has a separate queue, customers have to guess which line will move the fastest, to minimize their wait times. They are often frustrated to be wrong or be stuck behind another customer who encounters a problem or who takes excessive time to check out. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person. Regardless of the configuration, checkout lines usually pass by impulse buy items to grab the attention of otherwise idle customers.

As self-checkout technology has progressed, more retailers of all types have included self-checkout as an option, and in some cases, completely replace traditional cashier-operated checkout lines. Self-checkout kiosks are typically kept together in a &#x27;corral&#x27; area adjacent to the regular registers so that shop employees can more easily monitor transactions, though they are also occasionally set up in a more typical &quot;lane&quot; fashion with conveyor belts for loading groceries. More modern implementations of self-checkout include scanning items and paying within a retailer&#x27;s mobile app, or using RF technology and cameras to detect items at the door and charge the customer&#x27;s account automatically.

==Hospitality industry==


Hospitality point of sale systems are computerized systems incorporating registers, computers and peripheral equipment, usually on a computer network to be used in restaurants, hair salons or hotels. Like other point of sale systems, these systems track sales, labor, payroll and can generate records used in accounting and bookkeeping. They may be accessed remotely by restaurant corporate offices, troubleshooters and other authorized parties.

Point of sale systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry, particularly in the fast food sector. In the most recent technologies, registers are computers, sometimes with touch screens. The registers connect to a server, often referred to as a &quot;store controller&quot; or a &quot;central control unit&quot;. Printers and monitors are also found on the network. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.

Typical restaurant POS software is able to create and print guest checks, print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation, process credit cards and other payment cards, and run reports. In addition, some systems implement wireless pagers and electronic signature-capture devices.

In the fast food industry, displays may be at the front counter, or configured for drive-through or walk-through cashiering and order taking. Front counter registers allow taking and serving orders at the same terminal, while drive-through registers allow orders to be taken at one or more drive-through windows, to be cashiered and served at another. In addition to registers, drive-through and kitchen displays are used to view orders. Once orders appear they may be deleted or recalled by the touch interface or by bump bars. Drive-through systems are often enhanced by the use of drive-through wireless (or headset) intercoms. The efficiency of such systems allows decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders.

Another innovation in technology for the restaurant industry is wireless POS. Many restaurants with high volume use wireless handheld POS to collect orders which are sent to a server. The server sends required information to the kitchen in real time. Wireless systems consist of drive-through microphones and speakers (often one speaker will serve both purposes), which are wired to a &quot;base station&quot; or &quot;center module.&quot; This, in turn, will broadcast to headsets. Headsets may be an all-in-one headset, or one connected to a belt pack.

With the development of the mobile technology, Cloud-based POS systems are also put forward to increase the efficiency of some restaurants, integrated with some latest software services such as scan QR code to order by customers themselves. It leads to a new style of offline restaurants dine-in.

In hotels, POS software allows for transfer of meal charges from dining room to guest room with a button or two. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.

Newer, more sophisticated systems are departing from the central database &quot;file server&quot; type system and going to what is called a &quot;cluster database&quot;. This eliminates any crashing or system downtime that can be associated with the back office file server. This technology allows 100% of the information to not only be stored, but also pulled from the local terminal, thus eliminating the need to rely on a separate server for the system to operate.

Tablet POS systems popular for retail solutions are now available for the restaurant industry. Initially these systems were not sophisticated and many of the early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen. Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection. Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible. Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include payments, loyalty, online ordering, table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers. Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, EMV chip-enabled cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards. Mobile POS (AKA mPOS) is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis.

With the proliferation of low-priced touchscreen tablet computers, more restaurants have implemented self-ordering through a tablet POS placed permanently on every table. Customers can browse through the menu on the tablet and place their orders which are then sent to the kitchen. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order. This apparently improves service and saves manpower on the part of the restaurant. However this depends on how intelligently the system has been programmed to be.

As a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table. As a result, the customer is left waiting and wondering why his second order of food and drink is not being served.

Another example of how intelligent the system can be, is whether an order that has been placed but not yet been processed by the kitchen can be modified by the customer through the tablet POS. For such an unprocessed order the customer should be given the option to easily retrieve the order and modify it on the tablet POS. When the order is being processed this function should be automatically disabled.

Self-ordering systems are not always free completely from intervention by the staff and for some good reasons. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. If alcoholic beverages are ordered, it is necessary for the waiter to verify the customer&#x27;s age before sending the order.

The technical specifications for implementing such self-ordering system are more demanding than a single cashier-controlled POS station. On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps a drink bar.

Some databases such as popularly-used Microsoft Access may have the specifications that it is capable of usage by multiple concurrent users. However, under the stress of a POS system, they can fail miserably resulting in constant errors and corruption of data.

POS systems are often designed for a variety of clients, and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs. Some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement. In some cases, POS systems are sold and supported by third-party distributors, while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor.

The selection of a restaurant POS system is critical to the restaurant&#x27;s daily operation and is a major investment that the restaurant&#x27;s management and staff must endure for many years. The restaurant POS system interfaces with all phases of the restaurant operation, and with everyone that is involved with the restaurant including guests, suppliers, employees, managers and owners. The selection of a restaurant POS system is a complex process that should be undertaken by the restaurant owner and not delegated to an employee. The purchase process can be summarized in three steps: Design, Compare and Negotiate. The Design step requires research to determine which restaurant POS features are needed for the restaurant operation. With this information the restaurant owner or manager can Compare various restaurant POS solutions to determine which POS systems meet their requirements. The final step is to Negotiate the price, payment terms, included training, initial warranty and ongoing support costs.

==Accounting forensics==

POS systems record sales for business and tax purposes. Illegal software dubbed &quot;zappers&quot; can be used on POS devices to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes.

In some countries, legislation is being introduced to make cash register systems more secure. For example, the French treasury is estimated to be failing to collect approximately €14 billion of VAT revenue each year. The Finance Bill of 2016 was intended to address some of this loss by making it compulsory for taxpayers to operate on “secure systems”. Therefore, from 1 January 2018, all retail businesses in France are required to record customer payments using certified secure accounting software or cash register systems.

A certified cash register system must provide for the (i) incommutable, (ii) security and (iii) storage and archiving of data. All businesses required to comply must obtain a certificate from the cash register system provider which certifies that the system meets these requirements. This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfills the new requirements.

If the business cannot provide this certificate to the tax authorities, they may be fined. And, if the tax authorities can demonstrate fraudulent use of the system, both the business and the software provider can face tax penalties, fines, and criminal sanctions. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d’accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.

==Security==
Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still vulnerable to employee theft through the sales window. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be an ordinary customer. During checkout, the cashier can bypass scanning certain items or enter a lower quantity for some items thus profiting from the &quot;free&quot; goods.

The ability of a POS system to void a closed sale receipt for refund purpose without needing a password from an authorized superior also represents a security loophole. Even a function to issue a receipt with a negative amount which can be useful under certain circumstances, can be exploited by a cashier to easily lift money from the cash drawer.

To prevent such employee theft, it is crucial for a POS system to provide an admin window for the supervisor or administrator to generate and inspect a daily list of sale receipts, especially pertaining to the frequency of cancelled receipts before completion, refunded receipts and negative receipts. This is one effective way to alert the company to any suspicious activity - such as a high number of cancelled sales by a certain cashier - that may be occurring, and to take monitoring action.

To further deter employee theft, the sales counter should also be equipped with a closed-circuit television camera pointed at the POS system to monitor and record all activities.

At the back end, price and other changes like discounts to inventory items through the administration module should be secured with passwords provided to trusted administrators. Any changes made should also be logged and capable of being subsequently retrieved for inspection.

The sale records and inventory are important to the business because they provide useful information to the company in terms of customer preferences, customer membership particulars, what are the top selling products, who are the vendors and what margins the company is getting from them, the company monthly total revenue and cost, among others.

It is important that reports on these matters generated at the administrative back end be restricted to trusted personnel. The database from which these reports are generated should be secured via passwords or via encryption of data stored in the database to prevent copying or tampering.

Despite all such precautions, the POS system can never be entirely watertight in security from internal misuse if a clever, dishonest employee knows how to exploit many of its otherwise useful capabilities.

News reports on POS system hacking show that hackers are more interested in stealing credit card information than anything else. The ease and advantage offered by the ability of a POS system to integrate credit card processing thus have a downside. In 2011, hackers were able to steal credit card data from 80,000 customers because Subway&#x27;s security and POS configuration standards for PCI compliance - which governs credit card and debit card payment systems security - were &quot;directly and blatantly disregarded&quot; by Subway franchisees.

In June 2016, several hundred of Wendy&#x27;s fast food restaurants had their POS systems hacked by illegally installed malware. The report goes on to say that &quot;the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated&quot; and that the &quot;hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy&#x27;s computer systems late last year&quot;.

These exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database.

In April 2017, security researchers identified critical vulnerabilities in point of sale systems developed by SAP and Oracle and commented, “POS systems are plagued by vulnerabilities, and incidents occurred because their security drawbacks came under the spotlight.” If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities provide a perpetrator with access to every legitimate function of the system, such as changing prices, and remotely starting and stopping terminals. To illustrate the attack vector, the researchers used the example of hacking POS to change the price of a MacBook to $1. The security issues were reported to the vendor, and a patch was released soon after the notification. Oracle confirmed security bug affects over 300,000 Oracle POS Systems

In some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals. Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter. This inconvenience is offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers.

With the launch of mobile payment, particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services including the use of payment terminals. For mobile payment to go fully mainstream, mobile devices like smartphones that are NFC-enabled must first become universal. This would be a matter of several years from the time of this writing (2017) as more and more models of new smartphones are expected to become NFC-enabled for such a purpose. For instance, iPhone 6 is fully NFC-enabled for mobile payment while iPhone 5 and older models are not. The aforesaid disastrous security risks connected with processing payment card usage through a POS system would then be greatly diminished.

<doc id="220635" wikidata="Q732103" url="?curid=220635" title="Sadaharu Oh">
<text>Sadaharu Oh (Japanese: , &quot;Ō Sadaharu&quot;; born May 20, 1940), also known as Wang Chen-chih (), is a Japanese-born Chinese former professional baseball player and manager who is currently the chairman of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Oh&#x27;s playing career spanned across four decades, during which he played for only the Yomiuri Giants. He holds the world career home run record at 868, over 100 more than MLB record holder Barry Bonds.

Oh batted and threw left-handed and primarily played first base. Originally signed with the powerhouse Giants in 1959 as a pitcher, Oh was soon converted to a full-time hitter. Under the tutelage of coach Hiroshi Arakawa, Oh developed his distinctive &quot;flamingo&quot; leg kick. It took Oh three years to blossom, but he went on to dominate Nippon Professional Baseball. He was a 15-time home run champion and was named to the Central League All-Star team 18 times. More than just a power hitter, Oh was a five-time batting champion and won the Japanese Central League&#x27;s batting triple crown twice. With Oh at first base, the Yomiuri Giants won 11 Japan Series championships, including 9 in a row from to . Oh was named the Central League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player nine times. 

In addition to the world career home run record, Oh set many other NPB batting records, including runs batted in (RBI) (2,170), slugging percentage (.634), bases on balls (2,390), and on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) (1.080). He held Japan&#x27;s single-season home run record with 55, until Wladimir Balentien broke the record in 2013. In 1977, Oh became the first recipient of the People&#x27;s Honour Award. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994.

After retiring as a player, Oh served as the Giants&#x27; manager from 1984 to 1988. He also managed the Fukuoka Daiei/Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks from 1995 to 2008. He was the manager of the Japanese national team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, which defeated Cuba for the championship. He is currently the chairman of the Hawks.

== Early life ==
Oh was born in Sumida, Tokyo, as the fifth of six children (four daughters and two sons) of a Japanese mother Tomi Oh (née Tozumi ) and a Chinese father (王仕福 &quot;Wáng Shìfú&quot; from Qingtian County, Zhejiang. His older twin sister died when they were 15 months old, and his younger sister died shortly after she was born, He was eventually raised as the youngest of four remaining children. Although born in Japan, Oh is a citizen of the Republic of China (ROC), as his father had left for Japan when the ROC still governed mainland China and chose to retain his ROC citizenship.

==Playing career==

===Prep career===
Oh managed to make his high school team, and, in 1957, made it to the Spring Koshien Tournament with the second-year Oh as its ace pitcher. Before the tournament started, Oh suffered serious blisters on two fingers of his pitching hand. Oh pitched the entire first game at Koshien and his team won. The next day, Oh pitched another complete game and earned the victory, but the blisters worsened. Oh faced the prospect of pitching two more games on consecutive days for the championship with injuries. Oh pitched and won another complete game, enduring the pain.

Oh was able to just make it through his fourth complete game in four days, squeaking out a one-run victory. Oh won the championship, though was not allowed to play in the Kokutai due to being Chinese.

===Professional career===
In 1959, he signed his first professional contract as a pitcher for the Yomiuri Giants. However, Oh was not a strong enough pitcher to succeed professionally, and soon switched to first base, working diligently with coach Hiroshi Arakawa to improve his hitting skills. This led to the development of Oh&#x27;s distinctive &quot;flamingo&quot; leg kick. His batting average jumped from .161 in his rookie season to .270 in 1960, and his home runs more than doubled. His performance dipped slightly in both statistical categories in 1961, but Oh truly blossomed in 1962, when he hit 38 home runs.

In 1964, Oh hit 55 home runs, a single-season record he owned for 37 years until it was tied by Tuffy Rhodes in 2001. Oh surpassed 50 home runs in a season two other times, in 1973 and 1977.

Oh became friends with Hank Aaron, his contemporary in Major League Baseball. The two squared off in a home run derby before an exhibition game at Korakuen Stadium on 2 November 1974, after Aaron eclipsed Babe Ruth&#x27;s home run record. By that time, Oh was running away with the Japanese home run record, having become the first Japanese baseball player to hit 600 career home runs that year. Aaron won, 10–9.

His hitting exploits benefited from the fact that for most of his career he batted third in the Giants&#x27; lineup, with another very dangerous hitter, Shigeo Nagashima, batting fourth; the two players forming the feared &quot;O-N Cannon&quot;. In his autobiography, &quot;Sadaharu Oh: A Zen Way of Baseball&quot; (), Oh said he and Nagashima were not close, rarely spending time together off the field.

Sadaharu Oh retired in 1980 at age 40, having amassed 2,786 hits (third after Isao Harimoto (Jang Hoon) and Katsuya Nomura), 2,170 RBIs, a lifetime batting average of .301, and 868 home runs.

==Managing career==
Sadaharu Oh was the assistant manager of the Yomiuri Giants between 1981 and 1983. He became the manager of the Yomiuri Giants between 1984 and 1988. He led the Giants to one Central League pennant in 1987. He was asked to retire as Giants manager after the 1988 season.

In 1995, he returned to baseball as the manager of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (later the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks). Oh led the Hawks to three Pacific League pennants in 1999, 2000 and 2003, and two Japan Series titles in 1999 and 2003.

In 2006, Oh managed the Japan national baseball team, winning the championship in the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic over Cuba.

On July 5, Oh announced that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Hawks to combat a stomach tumor. On July 17, 2006, Oh underwent laparoscopic surgery to remove his stomach and its surrounding lymph nodes. The surgery was considered to be a success. Although the tumor was confirmed to be cancerous, it was caught in early stages. He returned to coaching the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, although he announced he would retire at the end of the 2008 season as manager, stepping into a front office role for the Hawks, which he has held ever since.

==Home run record controversy==
On three occasions, foreign-born players challenged Oh&#x27;s single-season home run record of 55 and faced Oh-managed teams late in the season. On each occasion, Oh&#x27;s pitchers refused to throw strikes to them.

In 1985, American Randy Bass, playing for the Hanshin Tigers, came into the last game of the season against the Oh-managed Giants with 54 home runs. Bass was intentionally walked four times on four straight pitches each time. Bass reached over the plate on the fifth occasion and batted the ball into the outfield for a single. After the game, Oh denied ordering his pitchers to walk Bass, but Keith Comstock, an American pitcher for the Giants, later stated that Giants coach and former Giant Tsuneo Horiuchi had threatened a fine of $1,000 for every strike that any Giants pitcher threw to Bass. The magazine Takarajima investigated the incident and reported that the Giants front office had likely ordered the team not to allow Bass an opportunity to tie or break Oh&#x27;s record, likely because ace Suguru Egawa went against this and pitched strikes to Bass anyway. For the most part, the Japanese media remained silent on the incident, as did league commissioner Takeso Shimoda.

In 2001, American Karl &quot;Tuffy&quot; Rhodes, playing for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, hit 55 home runs with several games left. The Buffaloes played the Oh-managed Fukuoka Daiei Hawks on a late weekend series in Fukuoka. Rhodes was intentionally walked during each at-bat. Hawks catcher Kenji Johjima could be seen grinning as he caught the intentional balls. Again, Oh denied any involvement and Hawks pitching coach Yoshiharu Wakana stated that the pitchers acted on his orders, saying, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t want a foreign player to break Oh&#x27;s record.&quot; Rhodes completed the season with 55 home runs. Hawks pitcher Keisaburo Tanoue went on record saying that he wanted to throw strikes to Rhodes and felt bad about the situation.

In 2002, Venezuelan Alex Cabrera hit 55 home runs with five games left in the season and his team played Oh&#x27;s Hawks. Oh told his pitchers to throw strikes to Cabrera, but most of them ignored his order and threw balls well away from the plate. This was also due to the fact Cabrera was walked by other teams in 2002, as he was likely on steroids after he was caught with Winstrol pills prior to signing with the Lions and was eventually named on the Mitchell Report in 2007. After the game, Oh stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to break the record, you should do it by more than one. Do it by a lot.&quot; In the wake of the most recent incident involving Cabrera, ESPN listed Oh&#x27;s single-season home run record on its list of &quot;The Phoniest Records in Sports&quot;. Cabrera called the whole thing &quot;racist&quot;.

Wladimir Balentien, a Curaçaoan born player, broke Oh&#x27;s single-season home run record on September 15, 2013, by hitting his 56th and 57th home runs of the season in a game against the Hanshin Tigers. Balentien ended that season with 60 home runs.

==Personal life==
Oh was married to , and had three daughters with her. She died of stomach cancer, the same disease he had in 2006, in December 2001 at age 57. Their second daughter, Rie (born in 1970), is a sportscaster and presenter on the J-Wave radio network.

<doc id="220636" wikidata="Q319891" url="?curid=220636" title="Universal suffrage">
<text>Universal suffrage or universal franchise ensures the right to vote for as many people bound by a government&#x27;s laws as possible, as supported by the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle. For many, the term universal suffrage assumes the exclusion of the young and non-citizens (among others). At the same time, some insist that more inclusion is needed before suffrage can be truly universal. Democratic theorists, especially those hoping to achieve more universal suffrage, support presumptive inclusion, where the legal system would protect the voting rights of all subjects unless the government can clearly prove that disenfranchisement is necessary. Universal full suffrage includes both the right to vote, also called active suffrage, and the right to be elected, also called passive suffrage.

==History==
In the first modern democracies, governments restricted the vote to those with property and wealth, which almost always meant a minority of the male population. In some jurisdictions, other restrictions existed, such as requiring voters to practice a given religion. In all modern democracies, the number of people who could vote has increased progressively with time. The 19th century saw many movements advocating &quot;universal [male] suffrage&quot;, most notably in Europe and North America. Female suffrage was largely ignored until the latter half of the century, when movements began to thrive; the first of these was in New Zealand, in which all adult women of all ethnicities gained the right to vote in 1893. A year later, South Australia granted all citizens the right to vote and stand for election, making it the first place in the world where women could stand as candidates for election to parliament. From there, this groundbreaking reform set a precedent for broader suffrage rights worldwide. However, voting rights were often limited to those of the dominant ethnicity.

In the United States, after the principle of &quot;One person, one vote&quot; was established in the early 1960s by the U.S. Supreme Court under Earl Warren, the U.S. Congress, together with the Warren Court, continued to protect and expand the voting rights of all Americans, especially African Americans, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965 and several Supreme Court rulings. In addition, the term &quot;suffrage&quot; is also associated specifically with women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States; a movement to extend the franchise to women began in the mid-19th century and culminated in 1920, when the United States ratified the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing the right of women to vote. It would be 1928 before voting rights were guaranteed to all women in the UK.

=== In more detail ===
France, under the 1793 Jacobin constitution, was the first major country to enact suffrage for all adult males, though it was never formally used in practice (the constitution was immediately suspended before being implemented, and the subsequent election occurred in 1795 after the fall of the Jacobin government in 1794 discredited most ideas associated with them, including that constitution). Elsewhere in the Francophone world, the Republic of Haiti legislated for universal male suffrage in 1816. The Second French Republic instituted adult male suffrage after the revolution of 1848.

Following the French revolutions, movements in the Western world toward more universal suffrage occurred in the early 19th century, and focused on removing property requirements for voting. In 1867 Germany (the North German Confederation) enacted suffrage for all adult males. In the United States following the American Civil War, slaves were freed and granted rights of citizens, including suffrage for adult males (although several states established restrictions largely, though not completely, diminishing these rights). In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the focus of the universal suffrage movement came to include the extension of the right to vote to women, as happened from the post-Civil War era in several Western states and during the 1890s in a number of British colonies.

On 19 September 1893 the British Governor of New Zealand, Lord Glasgow, gave assent to a new electoral act, which meant that New Zealand became the first British-controlled colony in which women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections. This was followed shortly after by the colony of South Australia in 1894, which was the second to allow women to vote, but the first colony to permit women to stand for election as well. In 1906, the autonomous Russian territory known as Grand Duchy of Finland (which became the Republic of Finland in 1917) became the first territory in the world to implement unrestricted universal suffrage, as women could stand as candidates, unlike in New Zealand, and without indigenous ethnic exclusion, like in Australia. It also lead to the election of the world&#x27;s first female members of parliament the following year. Federal states and colonial or autonomous territories prior to World War I have multiple examples of early introduction of universal suffrage. However, these legal changes were effected with the permission of the British, Russian or other government bodies, which were considered the sovereign nation at the time. For this reason, Australia (1901), New Zealand (1908) and Finland (1917) all have different dates of achieving independent nationhood.
The First French Republic adopted universal male suffrage briefly in 1792; it was one of the first national systems that abolished all property requirements as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Greece recognized full male suffrage in 1844. Spain recognized it in the Constitution of 1869 and France and Switzerland have continuously done so since the 1848 Revolution (for resident male citizens). Upon independence in the 19th century, several Latin-American countries and Liberia in Africa initially extended suffrage to all adult males, but subsequently restricted it based on property requirements. The German Empire implemented full male suffrage in 1871.

In the United States, the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1870 during the Reconstruction era, provided that &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot; This amendment aimed to guarantee the right to vote to African Americans, many of whom had been enslaved in the South prior to the end (1865) of the American Civil War and the 1864–1865 abolition of slavery. Despite the amendment, however, blacks were disfranchised in the former Confederate states after 1877; Southern officials ignored the amendment and blocked black citizens from voting through a variety of devices, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses; violence and terrorism were used to intimidate some would-be voters. Southern blacks did not effectively receive the right to vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

In 1893 the self-governing colony New Zealand became the first country in the world (except for the short-lived 18th-century Corsican Republic) to grant active universal suffrage by giving women the right to vote. It did not grant universal full suffrage (the right to both vote and be a candidate, or both active and passive suffrage) until 1919.

In 1902, the Commonwealth of Australia became the first country to grant full suffrage for women, i.e. the rights both to vote and to run for office. However, Australia did not implement universal suffrage at this time – nationwide voting rights for Aboriginal Australians were not established until 1962, before that varying by state.

Many societies in the past have denied or abridged political representation on the basis of race or ethnicity, related to discriminatory ideas about citizenship. For example, in apartheid-era South Africa, non-White people could generally not vote in national elections until the first multi-party elections in 1994. However, a nonracial franchise existed under the Cape Qualified Franchise, which was replaced by a number of separate MPs in 1936 (Blacks) and 1958 (Coloureds). Later, the Tricameral Parliament established separate chambers for Whites, Coloureds and Indians. Rhodesia enacted a similar statute to the former in its proclaimed independence of 1965, which however allowed a smaller number of representatives for the considerably larger Black majority (under its 1961 constitution, the voting classes had been based on socio-economic standards, which marginalized most Black and a few White voters to a separate set of constituencies, under the principle of weighted voting; this was replaced in 1969 by an explicitly racial franchise, with delegated all Blacks to the &#x27;B&#x27; voters roll).

==Women&#x27;s suffrage==

In Sweden (including Swedish-ruled Finland), women&#x27;s suffrage was granted during the Age of Liberty from 1718 until 1772.

In Corsica, women&#x27;s suffrage was granted in 1755 and lasted until 1769.

Women&#x27;s suffrage (with the same property qualifications as for men) was granted in New Jersey in 1776 (the word &quot;inhabitants&quot; was used instead of &quot;men&quot; in the 1776 Constitution) and rescinded in 1807.

The Pitcairn Islands granted restricted women&#x27;s suffrage in 1838. Various other countries and states granted restricted women&#x27;s suffrage in the later half of the nineteenth century, starting with South Australia in 1861.

The first unrestricted women&#x27;s suffrage in a major country was granted in New Zealand in 1893. The women&#x27;s suffrage bill was adopted mere weeks before the general election of 1893. Māori men had been granted suffrage in 1867, white men in 1879. The &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; index lists New Zealand as the only free country in the world in 1893.

South Australia first granted women suffrage and allowed them to stand for parliament in 1894.

In 1906, the autonomous Grand Principality of Finland became the first territory to give women full political rights, i.e. both the right to vote and to run for office, and was the second in the world and the first in Europe to give women the right to vote. The world&#x27;s first female members of parliament were elected in Finland the following year, 1907. After the German Revolution of 1918–19, the Weimar Constitution established universal suffrage in 1919 with a minimum voting age of 20.

The UK gave women the right to vote at the same age as men (21) in 1928.

In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic allowed women the right of passive suffrage with three women being elected.

During a discussion on extending women&#x27;s right to active suffrage, the Radical Socialist Victoria Kent confronted the Radical Clara Campoamor. Kent argued that Spanish women were not yet prepared to vote and, since they were too influenced by the Catholic Church, they would vote for right-wing candidates. Campoamor however pleaded for women&#x27;s rights regardless of political orientation. Her point finally prevailed and, in the election of 1933, the political right won with the vote of citizens of any sex over 23. Both Campoamor and Kent lost their seats.

In Switzerland, women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced at the federal level, by a nationwide (male) referendum in 1971, but the referendum did not give women the right to vote at the local Cantonal level. The Cantons independently voted to grant women the right to vote. The first Canton to give women the right to vote was Vaud in 1959. The last Canton, Appenzell Innerrhoden, had a centuries-old law forbidding women to vote. This was only changed in 1990 when Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Court ordered the Canton to grant women the right to vote.

==Youth suffrage==

The movement to lower the voting age many consider an aspect of universal suffrage that the youth rights movement has helped to lead. Organizations such as the National Youth Rights Association are active in the United States to advocate for a lower voting age, with some success, among other issues related to youth rights. A related movement, suffrage for Americans with disabilities provides important precedents and intersectionality with the movement to extend voting rights to children and youth.

== Non-citizen suffrage ==

While some jurisdictions extend the right to vote in at least some elections to resident non-citizens and non-resident citizens, many people remain unable to vote based on their citizenship and residency status. Non-citizen suffrage with non-resident citizen voting can result in dual transnational voting.

==Dates by country==

States have granted and revoked universal suffrage at various times.

&quot;Note: this chart does not indicate periods of autocratic rule (when voting has little or no power).&quot;
* Adult citizens There are no distinctions between citizens over a certain age in any part of its territories due to gender, literacy, wealth, social status, religion, race, or ethnicity.
* Male is for all males over a certain age in the majority ethnic or sectarian group irrespective of literacy, wealth, or social status.
* Female is for when all women over a certain age can vote on the same terms as men.
* Ethnicity is for when all eligible voters over a certain age can vote on the same terms as the majority or politically dominant group irrespective of religion, race, or ethnicity.

Since historically one group or another might have lost suffrage rights only to regain them later on, this table lists the last uninterrupted time from the present a group was granted the right to vote if that group&#x27;s suffrage has been fully restored.

<text>Giovanni Battista Cipriani (1727 – 14 December 1785) was an Italian painter and engraver, who lived in England from 1755. He is also called Giuseppe Cipriani by some authors. Much of his work consisted of designs for prints, many of which were engraved by his friend Francesco Bartolozzi.

==Life==
Cipriani was born in Florence. His family were originally from Pistoia. He first studied with Ignatius Hugford, a Florentine artist of English descent, and then under Anton Domenico Gabbiani. He spent the years 1750–53 in Rome, where he became acquainted with the architect, Sir William Chambers, and the sculptor, Joseph Wilton whom he accompanied to England in August 1755.

He had already painted two pictures, a &quot;St Tesauro&quot; and &quot;St Peter Igneo&quot; for the abbey of San Michele in Pelago, Pistoia, which had brought him a favorable reputation. He also painted one of the canvases of the organ of the church of Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi in Florence and the main altarpiece of the church of the Oratory of Gesù Pellegrino outside of the Porta San Gallo.

On his arrival to England he was patronized by Lord Tilney, the Duke of Richmond and other noblemen. When William Chambers designed the Albany in London for Lord Holland, Cipriani painted a ceiling. He also painted part of a ceiling in Buckingham House, and a room with poetical subjects at Standlynch in Wiltshire.

At Somerset House, also built by his friend Chambers, he prepared the decorations for the interior of the north block, including the rooms into which the Royal Academy moved in 1750, which now houses the Courtauld Gallery The central panel of the Royal Academy&#x27;s ante-room was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds but the four compartments in the coves, representing Allegory, Fable, Nature and History, were Cipriani&#x27;s. In the same building he also painted the monochrome decorations in the joint ante-room of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies.

According to Joseph Baretti in his &quot;Guide through the Royal Academy&quot; (1780), &quot;the whole of the carvings in the various fronts of Somerset Place — excepting Bacon&#x27;s bronze figures — were carved from finished drawings made by Cipriani.&quot; These designs include the five masks forming the keystones to the arches on the courtyard side of the vestibule, and the two above the doors leading into the wings of the north block, all believed to have been carved by Joseph Nollekens. The grotesque groups flanking the main doorways on three sides of the quadrangle and the central doorway on the terrace also appear to have been designed by Cipriani.
Cipriani was a founder member (1768) of the Royal Academy, and designed its diploma, which was engraved by Francesco Bartolozzi. In recognition of his services in this respect the members presented him with a silver cup with a commemorative inscription in 1769. He was much employed by publishers, for whom he made drawings in pen and ink, sometimes coloured. His friend Bartolozzi engraved most of them. Cipriani made some engravings, including &quot;The Death of Cleopatra,&quot; after Benvenuto Cellini; &quot;The Descent of the Holy Ghost,&quot; after Gabbiani; and portraits for Thomas Hollis&#x27;s memoirs, 1780. He painted allegorical designs for the Gold State Coach and the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Gold Coach, built in 1762 and 1757 respectively in 1782, and repaired Verrio&#x27;s paintings at Windsor and Rubens&#x27;s ceiling in the Banqueting House at Whitehall.

He also decorated furniture. He designed many groups, of nymphs and amorini and medallion subjects to form the centre of Pergolesi&#x27;s bands of ornament, and they were continually reproduced upon the elegant satin-wood furniture which was growing popular in his later days and by the end of the 18th century became a rage. These designs were sometimes inlaid in marquetry, but more usually painted onto the wood by other hands. Some of the furniture designed by the Adams was probably painted by Cipriani himself. He also occasionally designed handles for drawers and doors.

Cipriani died in Hammersmith in west London, and was buried at Dovehouse Green, Chelsea, where Bartolozzi erected a monument to his memory. He had married an Englishwoman, by whom he had two sons.

Among his pupils were John Alexander Gresse (1741–1794); Charles Grignion the Younger (1754–1804); and Mauritius Lowe (1746–1793).

<text>Thomas Phillips (18 October 1770 – 20 April 1845) was a leading English portrait and subject painter. He painted many of the notable men of the day including scientists, artists, writers, poets and explorers.

==Life and work==

Phillips was born at Dudley, then in Worcestershire. Having learnt glass-painting in Birmingham under Francis Eginton, he visited London in 1790 with an introduction to Benjamin West, who found him employment on the painted-glass windows of St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor. In 1791 he became a student at the Royal Academy, where, in 1792 he exhibited a view of Windsor Castle, followed in the next two years by the &quot;Death of Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, at the Battle of Castillon&quot;, &quot;Ruth and Naomi&quot;, &quot;Elijah restoring the Widow&#x27;s Son&quot;, &quot;Cupid disarmed by Euphrosyne&quot;, and other pictures.

After 1796, he concentrated on portrait-painting. However, the field was very crowded with the likes of John Hoppner, William Owen, Thomas Lawrence and Martin Archer Shee competing for business; consequently, from 1796 to 1800, his exhibited works were chiefly portraits of gentlemen and ladies, often nameless in the catalogue and of no great importance, historically speaking.

In 1804 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, together with his rival, William Owen. About the same time he moved to 8 George Street, Hanover Square, London, formerly the residence of Henry Tresham, R.A., where he lived for the rest of his life. He became a royal academician in 1808, and presented as his diploma work &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (exhibited the same year), perhaps the best of his creative subjects, apart from &quot;Expulsion from Paradise&quot;. Meanwhile, he rose steadily in public favour, and in 1806, painted the Prince of Wales, the Marchioness of Stafford, the &quot;Marquess of Stafford&#x27;s Family&quot;, and Lord Thurlow. In 1807 he sent to the Royal Academy the well-known portrait of William Blake, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which was engraved in line by Luigi Schiavonetti, and later etched by William Bell Scott.

His contributions to the academy exhibition of 1809 included a portrait of Sir Joseph Banks (engraved by Niccolo Schiavonetti), and to that of 1814, two portraits of Lord Byron (engraved by Robert Graves, A.R.A). In 1818 he exhibited a portrait of Sir Francis Chantrey, R.A., and, in 1819, one of the poet George Crabbe. His 1822 portrait of 
Sir Charles Asgill was exhibited at the Royal Academy that same year. In 1825 he was elected professor of painting at the Royal Academy, succeeding Henry Fuseli, and, in order to qualify himself for his duties, visited Italy and Rome in company with William Hilton, R. A., and also Sir David Wilkie, whom they met in Florence. He resigned the professorship in 1832, and in 1833 published his &quot;Lectures on the History and Principles of Painting&quot;.

Phillips also painted portraits of Walter Scott, Robert Southey, George Anthony Legh Keck (1830), Thomas Campbell (poet), Joseph Henry Green, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Henry Hallam, Mary Somerville, Sir Edward Parry, Sir John Franklin, Dixon Denham, the African traveller, and Hugh Clapperton. Besides these he painted two portraits of Sir David Wilkie, the Duke of York (for the town-hall, Liverpool), Dean William Buckland, Sir Humphry Davy, Samuel Rogers, Michael Faraday (engraved in mezzotint by Henry Cousins), John Dalton, and a head of Napoleon I, painted in Paris in 1802, not from actual sittings, but with Empress Josephine&#x27;s consent, who afforded him opportunities of observing the First Consul while at dinner. Years later in Paris, he was to portray his younger colleague Ary Scheffer (c. 1835, Musée de la Vie romantique, Paris).

A self-portrait, exhibited in 1844, was one of his last works.

Phillips wrote many occasional essays on the fine arts, especially for Rees&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;, and also a memoir of William Hogarth for John Nichols&#x27;s edition of that artist&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, 1808–17. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. He was also, with Chantrey, Turner, Robertson, and others, one of the founders of the Artists&#x27; General Benevolent Institution.

Phillips died at 8 George Street, Hanover Square, London, on 20 April 1845, and was interred in the burial-ground of St. John&#x27;s Wood chapel. He married Elizabeth Fraser of Fairfield, near Inverness. They had two daughters and two sons, the elder of whom, Joseph Scott Phillips, became a major in the Bengal artillery, and died at Wimbledon, Surrey, on 18 December 1884, aged 72. His younger son, Henry Wyndham Phillips (1820–1868) was a portrait painter, secretary of the &quot;Artists General Benevolent Institution&quot;, and captain in the Artists&#x27; volunteer corps.

Artist and illustrator, John William Wright (1802–1848), was his pupil.

<doc id="220642" wikidata="Q1503309" url="?curid=220642" title="Geometrization conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture (now a theorem) states that each of certain three-dimensional topological spaces has a unique geometric structure that can be associated with it. It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, which states that every simply connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic).

In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure. The conjecture was proposed by as part of his 24 questions, and implies several other conjectures, such as the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston&#x27;s elliptization conjecture.

Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem implies that Haken manifolds satisfy the geometrization conjecture. Thurston announced a proof in the 1980s, and since then, several complete proofs have appeared in print.

Grigori Perelman announced a proof of the full geometrization conjecture in 2003 using Ricci flow with surgery in two papers posted at the arxiv.org preprint server. Perelman&#x27;s papers were studied by several independent groups that produced books and online manuscripts filling in the complete details of his arguments. Verification was essentially complete in time for Perelman to be awarded the 2006 Fields Medal for his work, and in 2010 the Clay Mathematics Institute awarded him its 1 million USD prize for solving the Poincaré conjecture, though Perelman declined both awards. 

The Poincaré conjecture and the spherical space form conjecture are corollaries of the geometrization conjecture, although there are shorter proofs of the former that do not lead to the geometrization conjecture.

==The conjecture==
A 3-manifold is called closed if it is compact – without &quot;punctures&quot; or &quot;missing endpoints&quot; – and has no boundary (&quot;edge&quot;).

Every closed 3-manifold has a prime decomposition: this means it is the connected sum (&quot;a gluing together&quot;) of prime 3-manifolds. This reduces much of the study of 3-manifolds to the case of prime 3-manifolds: those that cannot be written as a non-trivial connected sum.

Here is a statement of Thurston&#x27;s conjecture:

:Every oriented prime closed 3-manifold can be cut along tori, so that the interior of each of the resulting manifolds has a geometric structure with finite volume.

There are 8 possible geometric structures in 3 dimensions. There is a unique minimal way of cutting an irreducible oriented 3-manifold along tori into pieces that are Seifert manifolds or atoroidal called the JSJ decomposition, which is not quite the same as the decomposition in the geometrization conjecture, because some of the pieces in the JSJ decomposition might not have finite volume geometric structures. (For example, the mapping torus of an Anosov map of a torus has a finite volume solv structure, but its JSJ decomposition cuts it open along one torus to produce a product of a torus and a unit interval, and the interior of this has no finite volume geometric structure.)

For non-oriented manifolds the easiest way to state a geometrization conjecture is to first take the oriented double cover. It is also possible to work directly with non-orientable manifolds, but this gives some extra complications: it may be necessary to cut along projective planes and Klein bottles as well as spheres and tori, and manifolds with a projective plane boundary component usually have no geometric structure.

In 2 dimensions, every closed surface has a geometric structure consisting of a metric with constant curvature; it is not necessary to cut the manifold up first. Specifically, every closed surface is diffeomorphic to a quotient of S2, E2, or H2.

==The eight Thurston geometries==
A model geometry is a simply connected smooth manifold &quot;X&quot; together with a transitive action of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; on &quot;X&quot; with compact stabilizers.

A model geometry is called maximal if &quot;G&quot; is maximal among groups acting smoothly and transitively on &quot;X&quot; with compact stabilizers. Sometimes this condition is included in the definition of a model geometry.

A geometric structure on a manifold &quot;M&quot; is a diffeomorphism from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;X&quot;/Γ for some model geometry &quot;X&quot;, where Γ is a discrete subgroup of &quot;G&quot; acting freely on &quot;X&quot; ; this is a special case of a complete (&quot;G&quot;,&quot;X&quot;)-structure. If a given manifold admits a geometric structure, then it admits one whose model is maximal.

A 3-dimensional model geometry &quot;X&quot; is relevant to the geometrization conjecture if it is maximal and if there is at least one compact manifold with a geometric structure modelled on &quot;X&quot;. Thurston classified the 8 model geometries satisfying these conditions; they are listed below and are sometimes called Thurston geometries. (There are also uncountably many model geometries without compact quotients.)

There is some connection with the Bianchi groups: the 3-dimensional Lie groups. Most Thurston geometries can be realized as a left invariant metric on a Bianchi group. However S2 × R cannot be, Euclidean space corresponds to two different Bianchi groups, and there are an uncountable number of solvable non-unimodular Bianchi groups, most of which give model geometries with no compact representatives.

===Spherical geometry S3===

The point stabilizer is O(3, R), and the group &quot;G&quot; is the 6-dimensional Lie group O(4, R), with 2 components. The corresponding manifolds are exactly the closed 3-manifolds with finite fundamental group. Examples include the 3-sphere, the Poincaré homology sphere, Lens spaces. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the Bianchi group of type IX. Manifolds with this geometry are all compact, orientable, and have the structure of a Seifert fiber space (often in several ways). The complete list of such manifolds is given in the article on spherical 3-manifolds. Under Ricci flow, manifolds with this geometry collapse to a point in finite time.

===Euclidean geometry &quot;E&quot;3===

The point stabilizer is O(3, R), and the group &quot;G&quot; is the 6-dimensional Lie group R3 × O(3, R), with 2 components. Examples are the 3-torus, and more generally the mapping torus of a finite-order automorphism of the 2-torus; see torus bundle. There are exactly 10 finite closed 3-manifolds with this geometry, 6 orientable and 4 non-orientable. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the Bianchi groups of type I or VII0. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry are all compact, and have the structure of a Seifert fiber space (sometimes in two ways). The complete list of such manifolds is given in the article on Seifert fiber spaces. Under Ricci flow, manifolds with Euclidean geometry remain invariant.

===Hyperbolic geometry H3===

The point stabilizer is O(3, R), and the group &quot;G&quot; is the 6-dimensional Lie group O+(1, 3, R), with 2 components. There are enormous numbers of examples of these, and their classification is not completely understood. The example with smallest volume is the Weeks manifold. Other examples are given by the Seifert–Weber space, or &quot;sufficiently complicated&quot; Dehn surgeries on links, or most Haken manifolds. The geometrization conjecture implies that a closed 3-manifold is hyperbolic if and only if it is irreducible, atoroidal, and has infinite fundamental group. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the Bianchi group of type V or VIIh≠0. Under Ricci flow, manifolds with hyperbolic geometry expand.

===The geometry of S2 × R===
The point stabilizer is O(2, R) × Z/2Z, and the group &quot;G&quot; is O(3, R) × R × Z/2Z, with 4 components. The four finite volume manifolds with this geometry are: S2 × S1, the mapping torus of the antipode map of S2, the connected sum of two copies of 3-dimensional projective space, and the product of S1 with two-dimensional projective space. The first two are mapping tori of the identity map and antipode map of the 2-sphere, and are the only examples of 3-manifolds that are prime but not irreducible. The third is the only example of a non-trivial connected sum with a geometric structure. This is the only model geometry that cannot be realized as a left invariant metric on a 3-dimensional Lie group. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry are all compact and have the structure of a Seifert fiber space (often in several ways). Under normalized Ricci flow manifolds with this geometry converge to a 1-dimensional manifold.

===The geometry of H2 × R===
The point stabilizer is O(2, R) × Z/2Z, and the group &quot;G&quot; is O+(1, 2, R) × R × Z/2Z, with 4 components. Examples include the product of a hyperbolic surface with a circle, or more generally the mapping torus of an isometry of a hyperbolic surface. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry have the structure of a Seifert fiber space if they are orientable. (If they are not orientable the natural fibration by circles is not necessarily a Seifert fibration: the problem is that some fibers may &quot;reverse orientation&quot;; in other words their neighborhoods look like fibered solid Klein bottles rather than solid tori.) The classification of such (oriented) manifolds is given in the article on Seifert fiber spaces. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the Bianchi group of type III. Under normalized Ricci flow manifolds with this geometry converge to a 2-dimensional manifold.

===The geometry of the universal cover of SL(2, R)===
The universal cover of SL(2, R) is denoted formula_1. It fibers over H2, and the space is sometimes called &quot;Twisted H2 × R&quot;. The group &quot;G&quot; has 2 components. Its identity component has the structure formula_2. The point stabilizer is O(2,R).

Examples of these manifolds include: the manifold of unit vectors of the tangent bundle of a hyperbolic surface, and more generally the Brieskorn homology spheres (excepting the 3-sphere and the Poincaré dodecahedral space). This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the Bianchi group of type VIII or III. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry are orientable and have the structure of a Seifert fiber space. The classification of such manifolds is given in the article on Seifert fiber spaces. Under normalized Ricci flow manifolds with this geometry converge to a 2-dimensional manifold.

===Nil geometry===
This fibers over &quot;E&quot;2, and so is sometimes known as &quot;Twisted &quot;E&quot;2 × R&quot;. It is the geometry of the Heisenberg group. The point stabilizer is O(2, R). The group &quot;G&quot; has 2 components, and is a semidirect product of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group by the group O(2, R) of isometries of a circle. Compact manifolds with this geometry include the mapping torus of a Dehn twist of a 2-torus, or the quotient of the Heisenberg group by the &quot;integral Heisenberg group&quot;. This geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on the Bianchi group of type II. Finite volume manifolds with this geometry are compact and orientable and have the structure of a Seifert fiber space. The classification of such manifolds is given in the article on Seifert fiber spaces. Under normalized Ricci flow, compact manifolds with this geometry converge to R2 with the flat metric.

===Sol geometry===
This geometry (also called Solv geometry) fibers over the line with fiber the plane, and is the geometry of the identity component of the group &quot;G&quot;. The point stabilizer is the dihedral group of order 8. The group &quot;G&quot; has 8 components, and is the group of maps from 2-dimensional Minkowski space to itself that are either isometries or multiply the metric by −1. The identity component has a normal subgroup R2 with quotient R, where R acts on R2 with 2 (real) eigenspaces, with distinct real eigenvalues of product 1. This is the Bianchi group of type VI0 and the geometry can be modeled as a left invariant metric on this group. All finite volume manifolds with solv geometry are compact. The compact manifolds with solv geometry are either the mapping torus of an Anosov map of the 2-torus (such a map is an automorphism of the 2-torus given by an invertible 2 by 2 matrix whose eigenvalues are real and distinct, such as formula_3), or quotients of these by groups of order at most 8. The eigenvalues of the automorphism of the torus generate an order of a real quadratic field, and the solv manifolds can be classified in terms of the units and ideal classes of this order.
Under normalized Ricci flow compact manifolds with this geometry converge (rather slowly) to R1.

==Uniqueness==
A closed 3-manifold has a geometric structure of at most one of the 8 types above, but finite volume non-compact 3-manifolds can occasionally have more than one type of geometric structure. (Nevertheless, a manifold can have many different geometric structures of the same type; for example, a surface of genus at least 2 has a continuum of different hyperbolic metrics.) More precisely, if &quot;M&quot; is a manifold with a finite volume geometric structure, then the type of geometric structure is almost determined as follows, in terms of the fundamental group π1(&quot;M&quot;):
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) is finite then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is spherical, and &quot;M&quot; is compact.
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) is virtually cyclic but not finite then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is S2×R, and &quot;M&quot; is compact.
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) is virtually abelian but not virtually cyclic then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is Euclidean, and &quot;M&quot; is compact.
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) is virtually nilpotent but not virtually abelian then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is nil geometry, and &quot;M&quot; is compact.
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) is virtually solvable but not virtually nilpotent then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is solv geometry, and &quot;M&quot; is compact.
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) has an infinite normal cyclic subgroup but is not virtually solvable then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is either H2×R or the universal cover of SL(2, R). The manifold &quot;M&quot; may be either compact or non-compact. If it is compact, then the 2 geometries can be distinguished by whether or not π1(&quot;M&quot;) has a finite index subgroup that splits as a semidirect product of the normal cyclic subgroup and something else. If the manifold is non-compact, then the fundamental group cannot distinguish the two geometries, and there are examples (such as the complement of a trefoil knot) where a manifold may have a finite volume geometric structure of either type.
*If π1(&quot;M&quot;) has no infinite normal cyclic subgroup and is not virtually solvable then the geometric structure on &quot;M&quot; is hyperbolic, and &quot;M&quot; may be either compact or non-compact.

Infinite volume manifolds can have many different types of geometric structure: for example, R3 can have 6 of the different geometric structures listed above, as 6 of the 8 model geometries are homeomorphic to it. Moreover if the volume does not have to be finite there are an infinite number of new geometric structures with no compact models; for example, the geometry of almost any non-unimodular 3-dimensional Lie group.

There can be more than one way to decompose a closed 3-manifold into pieces with geometric structures. For example:
*Taking connected sums with several copies of S3 does not change a manifold.
*The connected sum of two projective 3-spaces has a S2×R geometry, and is also the connected sum of two pieces with S3 geometry.
*The product of a surface of negative curvature and a circle has a geometric structure, but can also be cut along tori to produce smaller pieces that also have geometric structures. There are many similar examples for Seifert fiber spaces.

It is possible to choose a &quot;canonical&quot; decomposition into pieces with geometric structure, for example by first cutting the manifold into prime pieces in a minimal way, then cutting these up using the smallest possible number of tori. However this minimal decomposition is not necessarily the one produced by Ricci flow; in fact, the Ricci flow can cut up a manifold into geometric pieces in many inequivalent ways, depending on the choice of initial metric.

==History==
The Fields Medal was awarded to Thurston in 1982 partially for his proof of the geometrization conjecture for Haken manifolds.

In 1982, Richard S. Hamilton showed that given a closed 3-manifold with a metric of positive Ricci curvature, the Ricci flow would collapse the manifold to a point in finite time, which proves the geometrization conjecture for this case as the metric becomes &quot;almost round&quot; just before the collapse. He later developed a program to prove the geometrization conjecture by Ricci flow with surgery. The idea is that the Ricci flow will in general produce singularities, but one may be able to continue the Ricci flow past the singularity by using surgery to change the topology of the manifold. Roughly speaking, the Ricci flow contracts positive curvature regions and expands negative curvature regions, so it should kill off the pieces of the manifold with the &quot;positive curvature&quot; geometries S3 and S2 × R, while what is left at large times should have a thick–thin decomposition into a &quot;thick&quot; piece with hyperbolic geometry and a &quot;thin&quot; graph manifold.

In 2003, Grigori Perelman announced a proof of the geometrization conjecture by showing that the Ricci flow can indeed be continued past the singularities, and has the behavior described above. 

One component of Perelman&#x27;s proof was a novel collapsing theorem in Riemannian geometry. Perelman did not release any details on the proof of this result (Theorem 7.4 in the preprint &#x27;Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds&#x27;). Beginning with Shioya and Yamaguchi, there are now several different proofs of Perelman&#x27;s collapsing theorem, or variants thereof. Shioya and Yamaguchi&#x27;s formulation was used in the first fully detailed formulations of Perelman&#x27;s work.

A second route to the last part of Perelman&#x27;s proof of geometrization is the method of Laurent Bessières and co-authors, which uses Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds and Gromov&#x27;s norm for 3-manifolds. A book by the same authors with complete details of their version of the proof has been published by the European Mathematical Society.

==Higher dimensions==
In four dimensions, only a rather restricted class of closed 4-manifolds admit a geometric decomposition. However, lists of maximal model geometries can still be given.

The four-dimensional maximal model geometries were classified by Richard Filipkiewicz in 1983. They number eighteen, plus one countably infinite family: their usual names are E4, Nil4, , (a countably infinite family), , , , }&lt;/math&gt; × E1}}, , , H4, H2(C) (a complex hyperbolic space), F4 (the tangent bundle of the hyperbolic plane), S2 × E2, , , S4, CP2 (the complex projective plane), and . No closed manifold admits the geometry F4, but there are manifolds with proper decomposition including an F4 piece.

The five-dimensional maximal model geometries were classified by Andrew Geng in 2016. There are 53 individual geometries and six infinite families. Some new phenomena not observed in lower dimensions occur, including two uncountable families of geometries and geometries with no compact quotients.

<text>Juan María Solare (born August 11, 1966) is an Argentine composer and pianist.

==Education==
Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Solare studied and received his diploma in piano (María Teresa Criscuolo), composition (Fermina Casanova, Juan Carlos Zorzi) and conducting (Mario Benzecry) at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música Carlos López Buchardo. He also studied privately with Francisco Kröpfl.

Between 1993 and 1996 he undertook postgraduate studies on Composition at the Musikhochschule in Cologne (Germany) under the guidance of Johannes Fritsch, Clarence Barlow, and Mauricio Kagel, in the frame of a scholarship of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). Between October 1997 and February 1999, he did postgraduate studies with Helmut Lachenmann in Stuttgart. (Between July 1998 and June 1999 he held a scholarship from the Heinrich-Strobel Foundation (Baden-Baden).) Between 1999 and 2001 studied electronic music with in Cologne, with diploma. From June 2001 until May 2002 he was composer in residence at the , Germany.

In April 2005 he obtained the title &quot;Licenciado en Composición&quot; (Master&#x27;s degree) from the Instituto Universitario Nacional del Arte (IUNA) in Buenos Aires. Since 1993 he has regularly attended and participated in seminars given by Karlheinz Stockhausen. He passed the &quot;Konzertexamen&quot; (master) in electroacoustic composition at the Musikhochschule in Cologne on 5 December 2007. Currently he is working on a PhD in music education at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

==Teaching positions==
From 1986 until 1993 he taught harmony, morphology, and chamber music at the Conservatory of Tandil (Argentina). Since January 2002 he has given piano lessons at the Musikschule Bremen (Germany). Since October 2002 he has conducted the Orquesta No Típica, a chamber music group devoted to tango at the University of Bremen. Since October 2004 he has taught piano at the Hochschule für Künste Bremen. From December 2007 to April 2008 he was assistant professor at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Since 2008 he has taught New Music Theatre at the University of Bremen, where he conducts the Ensemble Kagel.

He has given courses and lectures on contemporary music at the &quot;Institut für neue Musik und Musikerziehung&quot; (Darmstadt), the Salzburg Experimental Academy of Dance (SEAD), the Ateneo de Madrid, the Université permanente (Nantes, France), and the Texas A&amp;M University (College Station, Texas).
In addition, he teaches piano and composition privately, and has presented public seminars on tango music. 

Since August 2013 Solare conducts the chamber orchestra of the Bremer Orchestergemeinschaft. 

==Compositions==

Solare has composed around 300 works, over half of them already performed. His pieces are broadcast regularly (Radio Nacional de España, Deutsche Welle, Radio Bremen, Radiofabrik Salzburg, Radio Universitaria São Paulo, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), Radio Berlin Brandenburg, Bayerischer Rundfunk).

In 2002 he received a commission from the CDMC (Centro para la Difusión de la Música Contemporánea, Madrid), in 2003 from the Kunststiftung NRW (Düsseldorf); in 2004 again from CDMC (Spain) and from the Landesmusikrat Bremen (Bremen Music Council), in 2011 from Eva Espoleta (Geneva). On 30 June 2004 his &quot;Concertango&quot; was premiered by the Orchestra of the Universität Bremen (cond.: Susanne Gläß).

===Film music===
He also composed the music for six short films:
* Desde la ventana (&quot;From the window&quot;), autobiographical documentary film of the Colombian Santiago Herrera Gómez, Cologne, February 1996.
* Mesa para dos (Table for two) by Medardo Amor and Angel Almazán, Madrid, August 2003.
* Electroacoustic music for the experimental short film &#x27;Bipolar&#x27; by the German director Axel Largo, Bonn, June 2006.
* Music for the old (1951) scientific silent short film &#x27;Verformung von Metallkristallen&#x27; (The Deformation of Metal Crystals, catalogue number C 611 of the IWF, Institut für Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht, Abteilung Hochschule und Forschung, Göttingen) by Günter Wassermann (Clausthal). Premiere: cinema Metrópolis, Hamburg, 10 June 2007.
* Corazón en sombras (Heart in shadows) by Medardo Amor and Angel Almazán, Madrid, December 2007.
* Zima by Katarina Stankovich, Cologne, June 2011.

Solare has also written music for internet animations, mainly for movies of the Catalan artist Nuria Juncosa.

==Pianist==
As a pianist, his repertoire has four centers: classical music from the late Romanticism (such as Franz Liszt or Alexander Scriabin), contemporary classical (John Cage, Arnold Schoenberg), Argentine composers (including tango; Ástor Piazzolla), and his own compositions – both as soloist and in different chamber music groups, notably:
* Duo Tangente (violin -Gert Gondosch- and piano)
* Tango Nomade (saxophone -Eduardo Kohan- and piano)

Solare has performed in cities of Argentina, Germany, the rest of Europe and USA:
* Buenos Aires &amp; its suburban areas, Bariloche, Zárate, Córdoba, Tandil, Mendoza, Tucumán, San Martín de los Andes, Mar del Plata
* Göttingen, Cologne, Bremen, Bremerhaven, Worpswede, Ottersberg, Verden, Munich, Gersfeld, Misselwarden, Berlin, Hamburg, Bonn, Hannover, Heidelberg, Leipzig
* Amsterdam, London, Madrid, Sevilla, Geneva, Svendborg, Graz, Granada, Oviedo, Seinäjoki (Finland).
* College Station (Texas), Waco (Texas)

<text>John Marek (born 24 December 1940) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wrexham from 1983 to 2001, and the Member of the Welsh Assembly (AM) for Wrexham from 1999 to 2007. A member of the Labour Party until 2003, he successfully stood for re-election to the Welsh Assembly as a John Marek Independent Party candidate. Marek founded and led Forward Wales from 2003 until 2010, when the party was disbanded and he joined the Conservatives.

==Background==
Born in London, England and of Czech descent, Marek would be the only Czech-speaking MP during his tenure. He was educated at Chatham House Grammar School and at King&#x27;s College London where he earned a BSc in Mathematics in 1962, and a PhD in Mathematics in 1965. He became a lecturer in applied mathematics at Aberystwyth University.

==Political career==
Marek was elected a member of Ceredigion District Council in 1979 and served until 1983; he was chair of its finance sub-committee in the year 1982–83.

Having previously unsuccessfully contested Ludlow in October 1974, Marek was elected as Labour Party Member of Parliament for the Wrexham Westminster constituency in 1983 and served as a party spokesman on Treasury matters, although he was not offered a government post in 1997.

As a supporter of devolution, he chose to move to the National Assembly for Wales in 1999, and stood down from the UK Parliament in 2001. In the Assembly he became increasingly known as a maverick. In 2000, he was elected as Deputy Presiding Officer against the candidate preferred by the Labour leadership. This move, and his frequent criticisms of the Labour-led Wrexham County Borough led to his deselection as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the National Assembly elections of 1 May 2003.

Marek then stood as a candidate for the John Marek Independent Party and defeated the official Labour Party candidate, Lesley Griffiths, a former secretary of his, by 973 votes. Later that year he formed a new political party called Forward Wales (). He ran for re-election in the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, but was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Lesley Griffiths by 1,250 votes, thanks to a swing to the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, and UKIP.

On 29 March 2010, Marek joined the Conservative Party, and was a member until 2016. He was confirmed as the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2011 Welsh Assembly election where he again came second to Griffiths, by 3,335 votes in the Wrexham constituency.

Marek is one of three Welsh MPs or AMs to win a constituency as both a party candidate and an independent, following S. O. Davies who was MP for Merthyr Tydfil from 1934 until his death in 1972, who was deselected by the local Labour Party on grounds of age prior to the 1970 general election but ran against the official candidate as an independent and won; and Peter Law who was barred from contesting his seat for Labour due to an all-woman shortlist being imposed 

==Wrexham AFC==
In 2006, Marek was appointed as Vice President of Wrexham A.F.C. by then owners Nev Dickens and Geoff Moss. He remained in the position until the club passed into the ownership of the Wrexham Supporters Trust.

<text>Leadbeater&#x27;s possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) is a critically endangered possum largely restricted to small pockets of alpine ash, mountain ash, and snow gum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne. It is primitive, relict, and non-gliding, and, as the only species in the petaurid genus &quot;Gymnobelideus&quot;, represents an ancestral form. Formerly, Leadbeater&#x27;s possums were moderately common within the very small areas they inhabited; their requirement for year-round food supplies and tree-holes to take refuge in during the day restricts them to mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with a dense mid-story of &quot;Acacia&quot;. The species was named in 1867 after John Leadbeater, the then taxidermist at the Museum Victoria. They also go by the common name of fairy possum. On 2 March 1971, the State of Victoria made the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum its faunal emblem.

==History==
Leadbeater&#x27;s possum is thought to have evolved about 20 million years ago. It was not discovered until 1867 and was originally known only through five specimens, the last one collected in 1909. From that time on, the fear that it might be extinct gradually grew into near-certainty after the swamps and wetlands in Australia around Bass River in south-west Gippsland were drained for farming in the early 1900s.

By the time of the 1939 Black Friday fires, the species was thought to have been extinct. Then, on 3 April 1961, a member of the species was rediscovered by naturalist Eric Wilkinson in the forests near Cambarville, and the first specimen in more than 50 years was captured later in the month.

In 1961, a colony was discovered near Marysville. Extensive searches since then have found the existing population in the highlands. However, the availability of suitable habitat is critical: forest must be neither too old nor too young, with conservation efforts for Leadbeater&#x27;s possum involving protection of remaining old-growth stands, and maintenance of younger stands that are allowed to attain hollow-bearing age.

The combination of 40-year-old regrowth (for food) and large dead trees left still standing after the fires (for shelter and nesting) allowed the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum population to expand to an estimated peak of about 7500 in the early 1980s. From its peak in the 1980s, the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum population was expected to further decline rapidly, by as much as 90%, due to a habitat bottleneck. The population has dropped sharply since 1996. Particularly, the February 2009 Black Saturday bushfires destroyed 43% of Leadbeater&#x27;s possums&#x27; habitat in the Central Highlands, halving the wild population to 1,500. A study in 2014 concluded there is a 92% chance the Leadbeater&#x27;s ecosystem in the Victoria central highlands will collapse within 50 years.

==Habits==
Leadbeater&#x27;s possums are rarely seen as they are nocturnal, fast-moving, and occupy the upper storey of some of the tallest forest trees in the world. They have an average body length of 33 cm (13 inches) with the tail included. They live in small family colonies of up to 12 individuals, including one monogamous breeding pair. Mating occurs only once a year, with a maximum of two joeys being born to each pair. All members sleep together in a nest made out of shredded bark in a tree hollow, anywhere from 6 to 30 metres above ground level and roughly in the centre of a territory of 3 hectares, which they defend actively. The society of Leadbeater&#x27;s possums is matriarchal: each group is dominated by only one female Leadbeater&#x27;s possum that is active in expelling outsiders. Other juvenile females are weaned off before they reach sexual maturity. In addition, female Leadbeater&#x27;s possums are more aggressive in nature, often engaging in frequent fights with other females, including their own daughters. Due to the constant attacks, young females are forced to leave much earlier than their male brothers, which results in the extremely high male to female ratio of 3:1.

Solitary Leadbeater&#x27;s possums have difficulty surviving: when young males disperse at about 15 months of age, they tend either to join another colony as a supernumerary member, or to gather together into bachelor groups while they wait to find a mate.

At dusk, Leadbeater&#x27;s possums emerge from the nest and spread out to forage in the sub-canopy, often making substantial leaps from tree to tree (they require continuous understory to travel). Their diet is omnivorous: feeding on a range of wattle saps and exudates, lerps, and a high proportion of arthropods which they find under the loose bark of eucalypts, including spiders, crickets, termites and beetles. Plant exudates make up 80% of their energy intake, but the protein provided by the arthropods is essential for successful breeding.

Births are usually timed for the beginning of winter (May and June) or late spring (October and November). Most litters are of one or two young, which stay in the pouch for 80 to 90 days, and first emerge from the nest following this. Young, newly independent Leadbeater&#x27;s possums are very vulnerable to owls.

 Leadbeater&#x27;s possums are found in three habitat types: lowland swamp gum, of Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve; montane ash forest, wet sclerophyll forest dominated by mountain ash, shining gum and alpine ash with a dense mid-story of acacia species; sub-alpine woodlands of Mount Baw Baw, Lake Mountain and Mount Bullfight.

==Threats==

Leadbeater&#x27;s possums and their forest habitat have been the subject of the largest longitudinal study of any species in the world—conducted by David Lindenmayer, a professor at the Australian National University, and his research assistants since 1983. Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific papers, journal articles and books have resulted from the years of data collection by the ANU team. Their findings show that the availability of suitable habitat is critical: forest must be neither too old nor too young, with conservation efforts for Leadbeater&#x27;s possums involving protection of remaining old-growth stands, and maintenance of younger stands that are allowed to attain hollow-bearing age. Clearfell logging and salvage logging (after bushfires) have been proven by the researchers to have been the greatest threat to the possums&#x27; conservation in the wild over the last three decades of the 20th century.

===Habitat loss===

The entire Central Highlands population distribution is confined to a 70 by 80 kilometre area. With 43% of its known Central Highlands habitat destroyed in the bushfires of February 2009 – large areas of forest around Toolangi, Marysville, Narbethong, Cambarville and Healesville – the species&#x27; status is currently in doubt. Consequently, in December 2012, David Lindenmayer and Zoos Victoria&#x27;s threatened species biologist, Dan Harley, submitted an application to the federal government for a revision of the species status, providing evidence that it should be relisted as critically endangered. The then minister for the environment, Tony Burke, agreed with the nomination and forwarded the application to the scientific committee of the EPBC Act requesting urgent consideration. On 22 April 2015, it was decided to relist the species as critically endangered.

The only remaining population outside the Central Highlands is located at Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. Harley has estimated this population to be fewer than 50.

===Logging===
As the species is endangered and occupies a restricted range, logging continues to pose a critical threat to the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum. The logging in 1993 of &quot;much of the possum&#x27;s habitat, known as zone one&quot; a five hectare reserve east of Powelltown, followed a &quot;mapping error&quot;. Author Peter Preuss stated that the possum&#x27;s population faltered in 1997 with current habitat (limited to a 50-square-kilometre area) under threat from logging. He emphasised the need to relaunch a breeding program.

Despite a joint federal and state government plan to save it, since the 1980s, the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum population halved to around 2000 even before the Black Saturday fires. Many more were killed early in 2007 when the government-backed enterprise company, VicForests, bulldozed large firebreaks through Leadbeater&#x27;s monitoring stations following the Christmas fires – firebreaks and clear-felling also prevent breeding with nearby colonies.
David Lindenmayer (Australian National University) has argued that the need for nest boxes indicates that logging practices are not ecologically sustainable for conserving hollow-dependent species like the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum. Studies have shown that clear-felling operations, such as the logging run in state forest between the Yarra Ranges National Park and Mount Bullfight Conservation Reserve in February 2006, led to the deaths of most possums in the area—&quot;Adult animals have a strong affinity with their home range and are reluctant to move&quot;.

Salvage logging since the fires has posed a further risk to this extremely diminished population with clear-felling also approved by VicForests in the few remaining unburnt areas, such as the Kalatha Creek area of Toolangi State Forest in 2010, a move opposed by the Yarra Ranges Shire Council.

In 2012 MyEnvironment challenged VicForests&#x27; operations in three planned coupes in the Toolangi forest in the supreme court. The basis of their claim being that &quot;VicForests did not undertake adequate pre-logging surveys prior to logging in an area that we claim meets Leadbeater&#x27;s habitat and therefore should not have been logged.&quot; The proposed logging is to supply (taxpayer subsidised) pulp to manufacture &#x27;Reflex&#x27; copy paper—a product of Australian Paper owned by the Japanese company, Nippon Paper Group. During the case, film was recorded of a Leadbeater&#x27;s possum in the contested coupe area. The case was lost by MyEnvironment due to inconsistencies in the wording of the Leadbeater&#x27;s Possum Action Statement (10 years out of date) and the forestry prescriptions adhered to by VicForests. The group immediately appealed the decision by the presiding judge Justice Osborne, and the supreme court accepted there was a sound basis for an appeal to the original determination. A supreme court appeal was heard on 24 June 2013 before three judges and MyEnvironment was represented in court by Julian Burnside QC. The appeal was lost.

===Feral cats===
Previously feral cats had only been considered a peripheral threat to Leadbeater&#x27;s possums, but recent research has found video evidence of cats preying on possums leaving nesting boxes, and of possum remains in stomach contents of trapped feral cats. It is now considered that cats may be a more significant threat to possum populations, particularly in areas already disturbed by logging or bushfires.

===Legislation===
On 27 June 2013 the Napthine led State government passed legislative changes to allow VicForests access to Victoria&#x27;s forests for the next 25 years and to be self monitoring (this follows the success of other recent cases preventing logging of remaining possum habitat). According to The Wilderness Society, &quot;the Victorian government ... [is] virtually signing the death warrant of the remaining 500 or so Leadbeater&#x27;s possums.&quot; These changes to the &quot;Sustainable Forests (Timber) Act 2004&quot; will have implications not only for the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum but to the biodiversity, carbon storage and water catchments of the forests.

==Conservation==
On 22 April 2015, Greg Hunt, the Minister for the Environment, announced that the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum would be listed as a &quot;critically endangered&quot; species under the EPBC Act.

The forestry industry and Barnaby Joyce advocated for the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum to be taken off the critically endangered list. Following uproar from the logging industry &amp; the National Party it was soon placed under re-assessment. On the eve of an ABC 4 Corner episode on &quot;Extinction&quot; (24 June 2019) the then Environment Minister, Sussan Ley announced that it would be re-listed as &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

Of its ash forest habitat, about 30% is protected, while the rest is allocated to logging.

In addition there is a small isolated, genetically distinct, population protected within the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve. This lowland habitat consist primarily of Sedge-rich &quot;Eucalyptus camphora&quot; Swamp.

In 2013 it was proposed to create the &quot;Great Forest National Park&quot; to protect the mountain ash forest habitat. The park would protect the area between Kinglake, Baw Baw and Eildon national parks, which is also important for Melbourne&#x27;s drinking water and as a carbon sink.

Since 2004, the Friends of Leadbeater&#x27;s Possum community group has been active in raising the animal&#x27;s profile and lobbying for its conservation.

Through a joint community/government program, &quot;Project Possum&quot; has installed approximately 200 plastic nest boxes in the wild. Many of these nest boxes were paid for by a community fundraising campaign. The nest boxes are primarily used to assist with ongoing population monitoring and supplement the declining forest habitat. Project Possum has targeted two forest types: montane ash forest (i.e. Mt Ritchie, Dowey Spur, Ben Cairn) and sub-alpine woodland (i.e. Mount Baw Baw, Lake Mountain, and Mount Bullfight). The nest boxes are routinely checked for habitation every one or two years. Nest boxes located in the sub-alpine woodland tend to have a high uptake, while those located in montane ash forest have very limited uptake. An additional 50 nest boxes are due for installation in 2015–16.

=== Captive breeding ===
Des Hackett is credited as the first person to successfully breed the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum in captivity. In May 2006, the last Australian specimen at the time, held at Healesville Sanctuary, died. In January 2010, Kasia, at the time the last captive Leadbeater&#x27;s possum worldwide, died at Toronto Zoo. of the few Lake Mountain Leadbeater&#x27;s possums remaining after the 2009 bushfire led to three remaining individuals being taken into captivity for their own protection. One animal has since died. There are no plans to release the remaining two animals despite a further two colonies of Leadbeater&#x27;s possums having recently been located at Lake Mountain in remnant gully vegetation. These two Lake Mountain animals are now on public display in the Nocturnal House as ambassadors for the species. Healesville Sanctuary&#x27;s captive breeding program for Leadbeater&#x27;s possums recommenced in May 2012 and now comprises 6 individuals from the genetically distinct Yellingbo population. they are housed as pairs in large enclosures off display, but are yet to breed.

==&quot;The Photo Ark&quot;==
On 14 September 2017, National Geographic reported that the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum was the 7,000th animal photographed for &quot;The Photo Ark&quot; by Joel Sartore. The project&#x27;s goal is to photographing all species living in zoos and wildlife sanctuaries around the globe in order to inspire action to save wildlife.

<text>The Donnersbergkreis is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the middle of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are Bad Kreuznach, Alzey-Worms, Bad Dürkheim, Kaiserslautern, Kusel.

==History==
The district was created in 1969 by merging the districts Kirchheimbolanden and Rockenhausen.

==Geography==
The district is located around the highest mountain of the Palatinate, the &quot;Donnersberg&quot; with 687 m above sea level.

==Coat of arms==
Both of the districts merged into the Donnersbergkreis had a wheel in their coat of arms, which are now also shown in the coat of arms of the new district. On the left is the red wheel of the Lords of Bolanden, taken from the Kirchheim coat of arms. The blue wheel on the right is the wheel of the Lords of Falkenstein, taken from the Rockenhausen coat of arms. The green field on the bottom with the peak symbolizes the Donnersberg, the highest elevation in the district, and the sun the importance of the sunny plains for viticulture.

<text>The command in the Unix family of computer operating systems is a utility that is used to compare two files for common and distinct lines. is specified in the POSIX standard. It has been widely available on Unix-like operating systems since the mid to late 1980s.

==History==
Written by Lee E. McMahon, first appeared in Version 4 Unix.

The version of bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Richard Stallman and David MacKenzie.

==Usage==
 reads two files as input, regarded as lines of text. outputs one file, which contains three columns. The first two columns contain lines unique to the first and second file, respectively. The last column contains lines common to both. This functionally is similar to .

Columns are typically distinguished with the character. If the input files contain lines beginning with the separator character, the output columns can become ambiguous.

For efficiency, standard implementations of expect both input files to be sequenced in the same line collation order, sorted lexically. The sort (Unix) command can be used for this purpose.

The algorithm makes use of the collating sequence of the current locale. If the lines in the files are not both collated in accordance with the current locale, the result is undefined.

==Return code==
Unlike , the return code from has no logical significance concerning the relationship of the two files. A return code of 0 indicates success, a return code &gt;0 indicates an error occurred during processing.

==Example==

$ cat foo
apple
banana
eggplant
$ cat bar
apple
banana
banana
zucchini
$ comm foo bar
 apple
 banana
 banana
eggplant
 zucchini
This shows that both files have one banana, but only bar has a second banana.

In more detail, the output file has the appearance that follows. Note that the column is interpreted by the number of leading tab characters. \t represents a tab character and \n represents a newline (Escape character#Programming and data formats).

==Comparison to diff==
In general terms, is a more powerful utility than . The simpler is best suited for use in scripts.

The primary distinction between and is that discards information about the order of the lines prior to sorting.

A minor difference between and is that will not try to indicate that a line has &quot;changed&quot; between the two files; lines are either shown in the &quot;from file #1&quot;, &quot;from file #2&quot;, or &quot;in both&quot; columns. This can be useful if one wishes two lines to be considered different even if they only have subtle differences.

==Other options==
 has command-line options to suppress any of the three columns. This is useful for scripting.

There is also an option to read one file (but not both) from standard input.

==Limits==
Up to a full line must be buffered from each input file during line comparison, before the next output line is written.

Some implementations read lines with the function which does not impose any line length limits if system memory suffices.

Other implementations read lines with the function . This function requires a fixed buffer. For these implementations, the buffer is often sized according to the POSIX macro .

<text>The green sulfur bacteria are a phylum, Chlorobiota, of obligately anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria that metabolize sulfur.

Green sulfur bacteria are nonmotile (except &quot;Chloroherpeton thalassium&quot;, which may glide) and capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis. They live in anaerobic aquatic environments. In contrast to plants, green sulfur bacteria mainly use sulfide ions as electron donors. They are autotrophs that utilize the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle to perform carbon fixation. They are also mixotrophs and reduce nitrogen.

==Characteristics==

Green sulfur bacteria are gram-negative rod or spherical shaped bacteria. Some types of green sulfur bacteria have gas vacuoles that allow for movement. They are photolithoautotrophs, and use light energy and reduced sulfur compounds as the electron source. Electron donors include H2, H2S, S. The major photosynthetic pigment in these bacteria is Bacteriochlorophylls &quot;c&quot; or &quot;d&quot; in green species and &quot;e&quot; in brown species, and is located in the chlorosomes and plasma membranes. Chlorosomes are a unique feature that allow them to capture light in low-light conditions.

==Habitat==
The majority of green sulfur bacteria are mesophilic, preferring moderate temperatures, and all live in aquatic environments. They require anaerobic conditions and reduced sulfur; they are usually found in the top millimeters of sediment. They are capable of photosynthesis in low light conditions.

The Black Sea, an extremely anoxic environment, was found to house a large population of green sulfur bacteria at about 100 m depth. Due to the lack of light available in this region of the sea, most bacteria were photosynthetically inactive. The photosynthetic activity detected in the sulfide chemocline suggests that the bacteria need very little energy for cellular maintenance.

A species of green sulfur bacteria has been found living near a black smoker off the coast of Mexico at a depth of 2,500 m in the Pacific Ocean. At this depth, the bacterium, designated GSB1, lives off the dim glow of the thermal vent since no sunlight can penetrate to that depth.

Green sulfur bacteria has also been found living on coral reef colonies in Taiwan, they make up the majority of a &quot;green layer&quot; on these colonies. They likely play a role in the coral system, and there could be a symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and the coral host. The coral could provide an anaerobic environment and  a source of carbon for the bacteria. The bacteria can provide nutrients and detoxify the coral by oxidizing sulfide.

One type of green sulfur bacteria, &quot;Chlorobaculum tepidum&quot;, has been found in sulfur springs. These organisms are thermophilic, unlike most other green sulfur bacteria.

=== Specific characteristics of genera ===
Green sulfur bacteria are family Chlorobiaceae. There are four genera; &quot;Chloroherpeton&quot;, &quot;Prosthecochloris&quot;, &quot;Chlorobium&quot; and &quot;Chlorobaculum&quot;. Characteristics used to distinguish between these genera include some metabolic properties, pigments, cell morphology and absorption spectra. However, it is difficult to distinguish these properties and therefore the taxonomic division is sometimes unclear.

Generally, &quot;Chlorobium&quot; are rod or vibroid shaped and some species contain gas vesicles. They can develop as single or aggregate cells. They can be green or dark brown. The green strains use photosynthetic pigments Bchl &quot;c&quot; or &quot;d&quot; with chlorobactene carotenoids and the brown strains use photosynthetic pigment  Bchl &quot;e&quot; with isorenieratene carotenoids. Low amounts of salt are required for growth.

&quot;Prosthecochlori&quot;s are made up of vibroid, ovid or rod shaped cells. They start as single cells that form appendages that do not branch, referred to as non-branching prosthecae. They can also form gas vesicles. The photosynthetic pigments present include Bchl &quot;c, d&quot; or &quot;e.&quot; Furthermore, salt is necessary for growth.

&quot;Chlorobaculum&quot; develop as single cells and are generally vibroid or rod-shaped. Some of these can form gas vesicles. The photosynthetic pigments in this genus are Bchl &quot;c, d&quot; or &quot;e&quot;. Some species require NaCl (sodium chloride) for growth. Members of this genus used to be a part of the genus Chlorobium, but have formed a separate lineage.

The genus &quot;Chloroherpeton&quot; is unique because members of this genus are motile. They are flexing long rods, and can move by gliding. They are green in color and contain the photosynthetic pigment Bchl &quot;c&quot; as well as &quot;γ-carotene&quot;. Salt is required for growth.

==Metabolism==
===Photosynthesis ===

The green sulfur bacteria use a Type I reaction center for photosynthesis. Type I reaction centers are the bacterial homologue of photosystem I (PSI) in plants and cyanobacteria. The GSB reaction centers contain bacteriochlorophyll a and are known as P840 reaction centers due to the excitation wavelength of 840 nm that powers the flow of electrons. In green sulfur bacteria the reaction center is associated with a large antena complex called the chlorosome that captures and funnels light energy to the reaction center. The chlorosomes have a peak absorption in the far red region of the spectrum between 720 and 750 nm because they contain bacteriochlorophyll c, d and e. A protein complex called the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex (FMO) is physically located between the chlorosomes and the P840 RC. The FMO complex helps efficiently transfer the energy absorbed by the antena to the reaction center.

PSI and Type I reaction centers are able to reduce ferredoxin (Fd), a strong reductant that can be used to fix and reduce NAD+. Once the reaction center (RC) has given an electron to Fd it becomes an oxidizing agent (P840+) with a reduction potential of around +300 mV. While this is not positive enough to strip electrons from water to synthesize ( = +820 mV), it can accept electrons from other sources like , thiosulphate or ions. This transport of electrons from donors like to the acceptor Fd is called linear electron flow or linear electron transport. The oxidation of sulfide ions leads to the production of sulfur as a waste product that accumulates as globules on the extracellular side of the membrane. These globules of sulfur give green sulfur bacteria their name. When sulfide is depleted, the sulfur globules are consumed and further oxidized to sulfate. However, the pathway of sulfur oxidation is not well-understood.

Instead of passing the electrons onto Fd, the Fe-S clusters in the P840 reaction center can transfer the electrons to menaquinone (MQ:) which returns the electrons to the P840+ via an electron transport chain (ETC). On the way back to the RC the electrons from MQH2 pass through a cytochrome bc1 complex (similar to the complex III of mitochondria) that pumps ions across the membrane. The electrochemical potential of the protons across the membrane is used to synthesize ATP by the FoF1 ATP synthase. This cyclic electron transport is responsible for converting light energy into cellular energy in the form of ATP.

=== Sulfur metabolism ===
Green sulfur bacteria oxidize inorganic sulfur compounds to use as electron donors for anaerobic photosynthesis, specifically in carbon dioxide fixation. They usually prefer to utilize sulfide over other sulfur compounds as an electron donor, however they can utilize thiosulfate or H2. The intermediate is usually sulfur, which is deposited outside of the cell, and the end product is sulfate. The sulfur, which is deposited extracellularly, is in the form of sulfur globules, which can be later oxidized completely.

The mechanisms of sulfur oxidation in green sulfur bacteria are not well characterized. Some enzymes thought to be involved in sulfide oxidation include flavocytochrome c, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase and the system. Flavocytochrome can catalyze the transfer of electrons to cytochromes from sulfide, and these cytochromes could then move the electrons to the photosynthetic reaction center. However, not all green sulfur bacteria produce this enzyme, demonstrating that it is not needed for the oxidation of sulfide. Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) also helps with electron transport, but, when alone, has been found to produce decreased rates of sulfide oxidation in green sulfur bacteria, suggesting that there is a different, more effective mechanism. However, most green sulfur bacteria contain a homolog of the SQR gene. The oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate could be catalyzed by the enzymes in the system.

It is thought that the enzymes and genes related to sulfur metabolism were obtained via horizontal gene transfer during the evolution of green sulfur bacteria.

===Carbon fixation ===

Green sulfur bacteria are photoautotrophs: they not only get energy from light, they can grow using carbon dioxide as their sole source of carbon. They fix carbon dioxide using the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA) cycle where energy is consumed to reduce carbon dioxide, rather than oxidize as seen in the forward TCA cycle, in order to synthesize pyruvate and acetate. These molecules are used as the raw materials to synthesize all the building blocks a cell needs to generate macromolecules. The rTCA cycle is highly energy efficient enabling the bacteria to grow under low light conditions. However it has several oxygen sensitive enzymes that limits its efficiency in aerobic conditions.
The reactions of reversal of the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle are catalyzed by four enzymes:

#pyruvate:ferredoxin (Fd) oxidoreductase:
#:acetyl-CoA + + 2Fdred + 2H+ ⇌ pyruvate + CoA + 2Fdox
#ATP citrate lyase:
#:ACL, acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi ⇌ citrate + CoA + ATP
#α-keto-glutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase:
#:succinyl-CoA + + 2Fdred + 2H+ ⇌ α-ketoglutarate + CoA + 2Fdox
#fumarare reductase
#:succinate + acceptor ⇌ fumarate + reduced acceptor
However, the oxidative TCA cycle (OTCA) still is present in green sulfur bacteria. The OTCA can assimilate acetate, however the OTCA appears to be incomplete in green sulfur bacteria due to the location and down regulation of the gene during phototrophic growth.

===Mixotrophy===
Green sulfur bacteria are often referred to as obligate photoautotrophs as they cannot grow in the absence of light even if they are provided with organic matter. However they exhibit a form of mixotrophy where they can consume simple organic compounds in the presence of light and CO2. In the presence of CO2 or HCO3−, some green sulfur bacteria can utilize acetate or pyruvate.

Mixotrophy in green sulfur bacteria is best modeled by the representative green sulfur bacterium &quot;Chlorobaculum tepidum&quot;. Mixotrophy occurs during amino acid biosynthesis/carbon utilization and energy metabolism. The bacterium uses electrons, generated from the oxidation of sulfur, and the energy it captures from light to run the rTCA. &quot;C. tepidum&quot; also exhibits use of both pyruvate and acetate as an organic carbon source.

An example of mixotrophy in &quot;C. tepidum&quot; that combines autotrophy and heterotrophy is in its synthesis of acetyl-CoA. &quot;C. tepidum&quot; can autotrophically generate acetyl-CoA through the rTCA cycle, or it can heterotrophically generate it from the uptake of acetate. Similar mixotrophic activity occurs when pyruvate is used for amino acid biosynthesis, but mixotrophic growth using acetate yields higher growth rates.

In energy metabolism, &quot;C. tepidum&quot; relies on light reactions to produce energy (NADPH and NADH) because the pathways typically responsible for energy production (oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and normal TCA cycle) are only partly functional. Photons absorbed from the light are used to produce NADPH and NADH, the cofactors of energy metabolism. &quot;C. tepidum&quot; also generates energy in the form of ATP using the proton motive force derived from sulfide oxidation. Energy production from both sulfide oxidation and photon absorption via bacteriochlorophylls.

===Nitrogen fixation===
The majority of green sulfur bacteria are diazotrophs: they can reduce nitrogen to ammonia which is then used to synthesize amino acids. Nitrogen fixation among green sulfur bacteria is generally typical of an anoxygenic phototroph, and requires the presence of light. Green sulfur bacteria exhibit activity from a Type-1 secretion system and a ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase to generate reduced iron, a trait that evolved to support nitrogen fixation. Like purple sulfur bacteria, they can regulate the activity of nitrogenase post-translationally in response to ammonia concentrations. Their possession of &quot;nif&quot; genes, even though evolutionarily distinct, may suggest their nitrogen fixation abilities arose in two different events or through a shared very distant ancestor.

Examples of green sulfur bacteria capable of nitrogen fixation include the genus &quot;Chlorobium&quot; and &quot;Pelodictyon&quot;, excluding &quot;P. phaeoclathratiforme&quot;. &quot;Prosthecochloris aestuarii&quot; and &quot;Chloroherpeton thalassium&quot; also fall into this category. Their N2 fixation is widespread and plays an important role in overall nitrogen availability for ecosystems. Green sulfur bacteria living in coral reefs, such as &quot;Prosthecochloris&quot;, are crucial in generating available nitrogen in the already nutrient-limited environment.

<text>Chicago house refers to house music produced during the mid to late 1980s within Chicago. The term is generally used to refer to the original house music DJs and producers from the area, such as Ron Hardy and Phuture.

==History and origins==
===Disco edits===

Following Chicago&#x27;s Disco Demolition Night in mid-1979, disco music&#x27;s mainstream popularity fell into decline. In the early 1980s, fewer and fewer disco records were being released, but the genre remained popular in some Chicago nightclubs and on at least one radio station, WBMX-FM.

In this era, Chicago radio jocks The Hot Mix 5, and club DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles played various styles of dance music, including older disco records, newer Italo disco, electro, EBM tracks, B-boy hip hop music by Man Parrish, Jellybean Benitez, Arthur Baker and John Robie as well as electronic pop music by Kraftwerk, Telex and Yellow Magic Orchestra.

Some of these DJs also made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape, focusing on the portions of songs which worked well on the dancefloor. Some even mixed in effects, drum machines, and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation in an effort to give songs more appeal. These edits and remixes were rarely released to the public, and even then were available only on privately pressed vinyl records or on mixtapes.

===European connection===
The early house music sound was a &quot;dialogue&quot; between Hispanic, and Black American post-disco and European post-punk electronic music and their traditions with Italo-disco picked or, emulated the most, as the template for house music. Precursors include electro songs &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;, Italo-disco (e.g. Klein + M.B.O.), on one hand; EBM (Liaisons Dangereuses; Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft on acid house) on another.

===Original productions===
On the history, Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk says &quot;Jesse Saunders was first[.] He put out records before anyone conceived of doing it, got all the girls, and all the fame. Jesse wanted to be the next Motown.&quot; Screamin&#x27; Rachael, co-founder of Trax Records, describes the music the following way &quot;[w]hat Trax did was really a combination of punk and industrial with a really great 4x4 dance beat. Today they want to call it EDM, but Chicago house is the mother of them all. A lot of people don’t want to recognize—I think people in the UK do, but others don’t. Part of it is that Chicago was never an industry town, and New York always likes to claim they did it first.&quot; In 1984, Saunders&#x27; label released, on 12-inch single, a song called &quot;On and On&quot;. Saunders composed the track with Vince Lawrence to replace a record that had been stolen from Saunders&#x27; collection, the &quot;On &amp; On&quot; bootleg disco megamix by Mach. That megamix, a pastiche of loops from several electronic disco records, particularly the bassline from Player One&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1979), had been Saunders&#x27; &quot;signature&quot; tune as a DJ; it was one that other DJs in the city did not play. Saunders and Lawrence added hypnotic lyrics and electronic instruments, utilizing a Roland TR-808 drum machine as electronic percussion as well as a Korg Poly-61 synthesizer and a Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. In a 2010 interview, Saunders claimed the song sought to capture the essence of the style of disco that other local DJs were playing at the time, a style he says was already known locally as &quot;house&quot;.

Saunders&#x27; success with the relatively unpolished &quot;On &amp; On&quot; inspired other Chicago DJs to try their hand at producing and releasing original songs in a similar style, using electronic instrumentation. Early such recordings included Jamie Principle&#x27;s and Frankie Knuckles&#x27; &quot;Your Love&quot; (1986); and Chip E.&#x27;s &quot;Jack Trax&quot; record (1985), featuring the songs &quot;It&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Time to Jack&quot;, each of which used complex rhythms, simple bassline, sampling technology, and sparse vocals. These producers were aided in their efforts by the availability of affordable, mass-produced electronic music instruments, especially those from the Japanese Roland Corporation, including the TR-909, TR-808 and TR-707 drum machines, TR-727 Latin percussion machine, Juno synthesizers, TB-303 bass module, and compact sequencers.

Although there are conflicting accounts of the term&#x27;s etymology, by 1985, &quot;house music&quot; was synonymous with these homegrown dance music productions.

===Increasing popularity and divergent styles===

As with other dance music, DJs and local club-goers were the primary audience for this relatively noncommercial music, which was more conceptual and longer than the music usually played on commercial radio. Mainstream record stores often did not carry it, as the records were not available through the major record distributors. In Chicago, only record stores such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, JR&#x27;s Music shop and Gramaphone Records were the primary suppliers of this music. Despite the music&#x27;s limited commercial availability, house records sold in the tens of thousands, and the music was further popularized via radio station 102.7 WBMX-FM, where Program Director Lee Michaels gave airtime to the station&#x27;s resident DJ team, the Hot Mix 5 (Ralphi Rosario, Mickey &quot;Mixin&quot; Oliver, Scott &quot;Smokin&quot; Silz, Kenny &quot;Jammin&quot; Jason, and Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk). The Hot Mix 5 shows started with the station&#x27;s launch in 1981, and was widely listened to by DJs and dance music fans in Chicago as well as visiting DJs and producers from Detroit.

Many of the songs that defined the Chicago house music sound were released primarily on vinyl by the labels DJ International Records and Trax Records, both of which had distribution outside of Chicago, leading to house&#x27;s popularity in other cities, including New York and London.

Trends in house music soon became subgenres, such as the lush, slower-tempo deep house, and the stark, especially hypnotic acid house. Deep house&#x27;s origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers&#x27;s jazzy, soulful recordings &quot;Mystery of Love&quot; (1985) and &quot;Can You Feel It?&quot; (1986), which, according to author Richie Unterberger, moved house music away from its &quot;posthuman tendencies back towards the lush&quot; soulful sound of early disco music.

Acid house arose from Chicago artists&#x27; experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style&#x27;s earliest release on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture&#x27;s &quot;Acid Tracks&quot; (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan &quot;DJ Pierre&quot; Jones, Earl &quot;Spanky&quot; Smith Jr., and Herbert &quot;Herb J&quot; Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context. The group&#x27;s 12-minute &quot;Acid Tracks&quot; was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably. The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine.

Chicago house music was being licensed to UK Labels by DJ International, Trax, KMS and the Transmat record labels, and with that the music began to expand throughout Europe. Especially the &quot;Jack Trax&quot; compilations, starting in 1987, helped to make rare house records from the U.S. available cheaply in Europe.

Several house tracks became #1 hits on the UK Singles Chart, starting with Chicago musician Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley&#x27;s &quot;Jack Your Body&quot; (1987). The first house record considered to be a major hit overseas is &quot;Love Can&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; by Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk and Jesse Saunders featuring Darryl Pandy, which peaked at #10 in the UK Singles Chart in 1986.

==Relationship to Garage and Techno==
At the same time as house was becoming big in Chicago, other related genres were forming in other major U.S. cities. Simon Reynolds&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Three Cities&quot; (the first chapter of his book &quot;Energy Flash&quot;) looked at the emergence of techno in Detroit, house in Chicago, and garage in New York City and the reasons why the cultures took off like they did. Detroit was a unique urban area where industrial jobs had placed blacks and whites in the same economic situations, and this led to the Europhilia of these black youths and popularity of techno music. It was an attempt &quot;to distance themselves from the kids that were coming up in the projects, in the ghetto.&quot; (Reynolds, p. 5)

==Subculture==
Chicago house aesthetic shared its look with other outsider hip hop and punk subcultures; however, the &quot;indisputable sign of house-ness&quot; came to be a &quot;Ralph Lauren preppie meets English country gentleman style, with cardigans, woolen jodhpurs and riding boots.&quot;

===The club scene===
When these house clubs and parties started to appeal to a wider audience, it was similar to the past disco culture in New York City. Both genres originated catering to very specific subcultures and when the popularity grew it changed the whole scene. The posting of &#x27;no jits&#x27; signs was &quot;to make them feel unwanted. And that was when the scene started to self-destruct.&quot; However, even though there are definitely parallels between house and disco clubs, this seemed more like a reversal of roles. The more elitist house listeners did not want to dilute their clubs and culture.
Pages 230–248 of Brewster &amp; Broughton&#x27;s &quot;Last Night a DJ Saved My Life&quot; also looked at the rise of the house scene in Chicago. Through showing Frankie Knuckles club, it gave a look at the club scene that was taking place and the energetic, sweaty, drug-fueled parties that house embodied. &quot;House was a feeling, a rebellious musical taste, a way of declaring yourself in the know&quot; (Broughton 242).

===Dance styles===

At least three styles of dancing are associated with house music: Jacking, Footwork, and Lofting. These styles include a variety of techniques and sub-styles, including skating, stomping, and shuffle steps (also see Melbourne Shuffle). House music dancing styles can include movements from many other forms of dance, such as and slamdancing, waacking, voguing, African, Latin, Brazilian (including Capoeira), jazz dance, Lindy Hop, tap dance, modern dance. House dancing is concerned with the sensuality of the body and setting oneself free in ecstasy—without the worry of outside barriers.

One of the primary elements in house dancing is &quot;the jack&quot; or &quot;jacking&quot;—a style created in the early days of Chicago house that left its trace in numerous record titles such as &quot;Time to Jack&quot; by Chip E. from the &quot;Jack Trax&quot; EP (1985), &quot;Jack’n the House&quot; (1985) by Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk (1985) or &quot;Jack Your Body&quot; by Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley (1986). It involves moving the torso forward and backward in a rippling motion matching to the beat of the music, as if a wave were passing through it. All footwork in house dancing is said to initiate from the way the jack moves the center of gravity through space.

== Influence and diaspora ==

House, perhaps more than any other form of Black music, has birthed many offshoots and spread its sound far and wide. The prevalence of four on the floor beats in dance music is largely derived from house. It has influenced, in some capacity, garage house, jungle music, Eurodance, electropop, dubstep, and even certain elements of alternative rock and hip hop. More direct offshoots of house (e.g. acid house) are also notable for their own offshoots that extend the Chicago variant&#x27;s family tree.

House also partakes in aspects of the musical traditions of other sounds. Most notable is the influence it takes from disco—genre progenitor Frankie Knuckles was himself a relocated New York Disco DJ. In many senses, house was a low-budget re-creation of disco, using synthesizers, sequencers, and samplers in the stead of orchestras and live performers. Disco also participated, to a less notable extent, in the soundsystem culture of typically Caribbean forms of dance music.

<text>Enguerrand de Monstrelet ( 1400 – 20 July 1453) was a French chronicler. He was born in Picardy, most likely into a family of the minor nobility.

==Life==
In 1436 and later he held the office of lieutenant of the &quot;gavenier&quot; (i.e. receiver of the &quot;gave&quot;, a kind of church rate) at Cambrai, and he seems to have made this city his usual place of residence. He was for some time bailiff of the cathedral chapter and then provost of Cambrai. He was married and left some children when he died.

Little else is known about Monstrelet except that he was present, not at the capture of Joan of Arc, but at her subsequent interrogation with Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Continuing the work of Froissart, Monstrelet wrote a &quot;Chronique&quot;, which extends to two books and covers the period between 1400 and 1444, when, according to another chronicler, Mathieu d&#x27;Escouchy, he ceased to write. In these can be found his commentary on the Battle of Tannenburg (1410) between the Teutonic Order and the Polish-Lithuanian and allied armies, where he stated that the King of Poland &quot;had just recently pretended to become a Christian in order to win the Polish Crown&quot;. But following a custom which was by no means uncommon in the Middle Ages, a clumsy sequel, extending to 1516, was formed out of various chronicles and tacked onto his work.

Monstrelet&#x27;s own writings, dealing with the latter part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, are valuable because they contain a large number of authentic documents and reported speeches. The author, however, shows little power of narration; his work, although clear, is dull. His somewhat ostentatious assertions of impartiality do not cloak a marked preference for the Burgundians in their struggle with France.

Among many editions of the &quot;Chronique&quot; may be mentioned those of J.-A. Buchon (1826) and the one edited for the &quot;Société de I&#x27;histoire de France&quot; by M Doüet-d&#x27;Arcq (Paris, 1857–1862). See Auguste Molinier, &quot;Les Sources de I&#x27;histoire de France&quot;, vols. IV and V (Paris, 1904).
