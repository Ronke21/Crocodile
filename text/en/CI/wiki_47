<text>Legião Urbana (Portuguese for Urban Legion) was a Brazilian rock band formed in 1982 in Brasília, Distrito Federal. The band primarily consisted of Renato Russo (vocals, bass and keyboards), Dado Villa-Lobos (guitar) and Marcelo Bonfá (drums). In its earlier days, Legião Urbana also had a full-time bassist, Renato Rocha, but he left the band due to creative divergences.

While Legião Urbana disbanded officially in 1996, after frontman Renato Russo&#x27;s death, it is one of the most famous Brazilian rock bands, alongside Os Mutantes, Titãs, Os Paralamas do Sucesso, and Barão Vermelho.

==History==

===The beginning===
Renato Russo (born Renato Manfredini, Jr.) founded Legião Urbana in 1982 in Brasília, after leaving his previous band Aborto Elétrico (&quot;Electric Abortion&quot;). Aborto Elétrico broke up due to repeated disagreements between Russo and brothers Flávio and Fê Lemos, his bandmates. After Aborto Elétrico split and Russo created Legião Urbana, the two brothers would also go on to found Capital Inicial.

Legião Urbana was initially formed by Renato Russo (vocals and bass) Marcelo Bonfá (drums), Eduardo Paraná (guitars) and Paulo Paulista (keyboards), but Paraná and Paulista would quickly leave the band. Ico Ouro Preto replaced Paraná as the guitarist. Dado Villa-Lobos replaced Ouro Preto in 1983. In the beginning of 1984, Renato Rocha joined the group as the bass player. Renato Russo would then focus on the vocals. He also played keyboards and acoustic guitar.

Many elements helped shape the identity of Legião Urbana. Russo was heavily influenced by The Smiths and U2.

Thematically, Russo and the other members were also influenced by literature, especially that of Portuguese poet Luís de Camões, whose poetry is featured in more than one of the band&#x27;s songs.

===&quot;Legião Urbana&quot;===
Legião Urbana&#x27;s self-titled first album was recorded and released in 1985. The album included the hits &quot;Será&quot; (&quot;Could It Be&quot;), &quot;Ainda É Cedo&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Still Early&quot;) and &quot;Geração Coca-Cola&quot; (&quot;Coca-Cola Generation&quot;). The album was released on the EMI label, and the band would stay with this record label for their entire career, with both positive and negative experiences.

===&quot;Dois&quot;===
In 1986, the band released &quot;Dois&quot; (&quot;Two&quot; – the album was planned to have two discs, but EMI refused to do it). The lyrics, melodies and personality of Renato Russo brought the band considerable notoriety in Brazil, especially among the younger generation which had grown up under the fear of the authoritarian Brazilian Military Dictatorship (1964–1985). The songs &quot;Tempo Perdido&quot; (&quot;Lost Time&quot;), &quot;Quase sem Querer&quot; (&quot;Almost by Accident&quot;), &quot;Eduardo e Mônica&quot;, &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and &quot;Índios&quot; (&#x27;&quot;Indians&quot;&#x27;) were particularly popular. The song &quot;Indios&quot; is particularly culturally relevant as it mentions Brazil&#x27;s troubled history with indigenous people, and remains one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs to this day.

===&quot;Que País É Este&quot;===
The band&#x27;s success was cemented in 1987, with &quot;Que País É Este&quot; (&quot;What Country Is This&quot;). They developed a devoted following, and the band came to carry the nickname &quot;Religião Urbana&quot; (meaning &quot;Urban Religion&quot;), something Renato Russo professed to hate.

This was the heaviest album Legião Urbana released during its existence, the only one which can be classified as punk rock. Two of the songs, &quot;Conexão Amazônica&quot; (&quot;Amazonic Connection&quot; – censored to contain heavy texts about drug trafficking and its routes via the Amazon, and critical intellectuals.) and the Dylan-esque &quot;Faroeste Caboclo&quot; – the latter with 168 different lines and ten minutes long – were censored because they contained what was then considered obscene content. &quot;Faroeste Caboclo&quot; was a huge success, nevertheless. Others, such as &quot;Que País é Este?&quot; (&quot;What Country Is This?&quot;), &quot;Eu Sei&quot; (&quot;I Know&quot;), &quot;Química&quot; (&quot;Chemistry&quot;), &quot;Angra dos Reis&quot; (a reference to a homonymous nuclear power plant that exists in Brazil) and &quot;Mais do Mesmo&quot; (&quot;More of the Same&quot;) were hits.

In the first concert in Brasília after the release of their first album, 200 people were wounded in a riot. The band would never again perform publicly in Brasília, the city from which Russo and other band members hailed.

===&quot;As Quatro Estações&quot;===
In 1989, before the release of &quot;As Quatro Estações&quot; (&quot;The Four Seasons&quot;), Renato Rocha decided to quit under pressure from Bonfá and Villa-Lobos. Russo returned to play bass, but he joined three touring musicians (bassist Bruno Araújo, keyboardist Mu Carvalho and guitarist Fred Nascimento). Although this album had the most financial success of any released by the group (and nearly every song on the disc garnered significant radio play), many fans disliked the big changes in the band&#x27;s style, especially punk rock fans. The songs would now talk about love and soul. &quot;Pais e Filhos&quot; (&quot;Parents and children&quot;), about broken, intact, happy and dysfunctional families, included the lyrics &quot;É preciso amar/as pessoas como se não houvesse amanhã/Porque se você parar/pra pensar/Na verdade não há&quot; (&quot;We must love people as if there was no tomorrow/Because if you stop to think about it/There really isn&#x27;t&quot;).

===1990s===
&quot;V&quot; was released in December 1991, considered the band&#x27;s darkest and most introspective album until then; at this point, the band was appearing less and less in public, doing only a few (very contentious) concerts. The album ran a long gamut of emotions and topics, with songs about drug abuse, the confused sentiments of a soul consecrated to a life of celibacy, and even the bizarre, classic French film &quot;The Golden Age&quot;.

&quot;Metal Contra as Nuvens&quot; (&quot;Metal Against the Clouds&quot;) clocked in at 11 minutes and is the longest song ever recorded by the band. Some of the more popular entries on the album are &quot;O Teatro dos Vampiros&quot; (&quot;The Theater of the Vampires&quot;), &quot;Sereníssima&quot; (&quot;Most Serene&quot;), &quot;Vento no Litoral&quot; (&quot;Coastal Wind&quot;), and &quot;O Mundo Anda Tão Complicado&quot; (&quot;The World Has Been So Complicated&quot;). One year after &quot;V&quot;, EMI released &quot;Música P/ Acampamentos&quot; (Music 4 Camping), which is a compilation of rarities and live material. A previously unreleased song, &quot;A Canção do Senhor da Guerra&quot; (&quot;The Warlord&#x27;s Song&quot;), which was to be in &quot;Dois&quot; and was rejected by EMI, turned into an immediate hit. The album had got featuring keyboardist Carlos Trilha and bassist Bruno Araújo, later the recording, Araújo left the band, and joined bassist Tavinho Fialho and guitarist Sérgio Serra.

The band released &quot;O Descobrimento do Brasil&quot; (&quot;The Discovery of Brazil&quot;, alluding both to Cabral&#x27;s discovery and to a new look at Brazil and its problems) in November 1993. &quot;Giz&quot; (&quot;Chalk&quot;), &quot;Perfeição&quot; (&quot;Perfection&quot;), &quot;Vinte e Nove&quot; (&quot;Twenty Nine&quot;), &quot;Vamos Fazer um Filme&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Make A Movie&quot;) and &quot;La Nuova Gioventù&quot; (Italian for &quot;The New Youth&quot;) are the main hits of the CD, though the album as a whole received a rather chilly critical reception.

&quot;Perfeição&quot; was a scathing rebuke of Brazilian government and society, inviting the listener to celebrate everything stupid, evil and ugly about the country. The song compares Brazil to a house of marked cards, a den of thieves, and a State that is not a nation, but the song explodes any pretensions of moral superiority towards the end by remarking on, above all else, the stupidity of the person singing the song. After the energy and anger of the main body of the song, this final section is almost wistful. The music continues to race ahead, but the vocal seems to be trying to pull it back, simultaneously celebrating and undercutting the belief that perfection is achievable, at least in the heart. The song&#x27;s popular success is emblematic of the political changes that had taken place in Brazil since the band&#x27;s inception: it certainly could not have been distributed during the days of Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship.

The band members confessed that the track &quot;Giz&quot; was one of Renato Russo&#x27;s favorite songs among all Legião Urbana&#x27;s discography.

The same year, Russo released a solo album in English, &quot;The Stonewall Celebration Concert&quot;.

&quot;A Tempestade, ou O Livro dos Dias&quot; (&quot;The Storm&quot; or &quot;The Book of Days&quot;) was recorded between January and June 1996 and released on 20 September 1996. This would be the last album released before Renato Russo&#x27;s death less than a month later. This album surpassed &quot;V&quot; in terms of introspection and sadness in the lyrics, probably related to the state of Russo&#x27;s health.

===Disbanding===
In January 1995 the band performed its last concert. In December Renato Russo released his second solo album, &quot;Equilíbrio Distante&quot;.
A posthumous album recorded between January and June 1996 and released on 18 July 1997. Most of the tracks are leftovers from &quot;A Tempestade&quot;, which was originally planned as a double album. &quot;Uma Outra Estação&quot; (&quot;Another Season&quot;) was completed by the remaining members of the band plus keyboardist Carlos Trilha and guitarist Tom Capone.
&quot;Acústico MTV: Legião Urbana&quot; is an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album that was recorded on 28 January 1992 and released on 27 October 1999.

In September 1996 the band released its last album with Renato Russo still alive: &quot;A Tempestade&quot;. The CD has a very sad tone, directly connected to the fact that Russo and his health were deteriorating very quickly, both psychologically and physically.

Renato Russo would die one month after the release of &quot;Tempestade&quot;, on 11 October 1996, from an AIDS-related illness. Eleven days later, Bonfá and Villa-Lobos announced that the band was officially disbanded.

&quot;Uma Outra Estação&quot; was released in June 1997 and is the last album with previously unreleased songs, produced and finished by Villa-Lobos. In October 1999 EMI released a Live album, &quot;Acústico MTV&quot;, a concert which was presented on MTV Brasil in 1992. Another two albums, &quot;As Quatro Estações Ao Vivo&quot; and &quot;Como É Que Se Diz Eu Te Amo&quot;, are best-of compilations that achieved relative success among the fans and people whose interest in Legião Urbana grew after the death of Russo.

<text>A is a structure whose main purpose is to house (&quot;enshrine&quot;) one or more &quot;kami&quot;, the deities of the Shinto religion.

The &quot;honden&quot; (本殿, meaning: &quot;main hall&quot;) is where a shrine&#x27;s patron &quot;kami&quot; is/are enshrined. The &quot;honden&quot; may be absent in cases where a shrine stands on or near a sacred mountain, tree, or other object which can be worshipped directly or in cases where a shrine possesses either an altar-like structure, called a &quot;himorogi,&quot; or an object believed to be capable of attracting spirits, called a &quot;yorishiro,&quot; which can also serve as direct bonds to a &quot;kami&quot;. There may be a and other structures as well. 

Although only one word (&quot;shrine&quot;) is used in English, in Japanese, Shinto shrines may carry any one of many different, non-equivalent names like &quot;gongen&quot;, &quot;-gū&quot;, &quot;jinja&quot;, &quot;jingū&quot;, &quot;mori&quot;, &quot;myōjin&quot;, &quot;-sha&quot;, &quot;taisha&quot;, &quot;ubusuna&quot; or &quot;yashiro&quot;. Miniature shrines (&quot;hokora&quot;) can occasionally be found on roadsides. Large shrines sometimes have on their precincts miniature shrines, or . &quot;Mikoshi&quot;, the palanquins which are carried on poles during festivals (&quot;matsuri&quot;), also enshrine &quot;kami&quot; and are therefore considered shrines.

In 1972, the Agency for Cultural Affairs placed the number of shrines at 79,467, mostly affiliated with the . Some shrines, such as the Yasukuni Shrine, are totally independent of any outside authority. The number of Shinto shrines in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000.

Since ancient times, the &quot;Shake&quot; (社家) families dominated Shinto shrines through hereditary positions, and at some shrines the hereditary succession continues to present day.

The Unicode character representing a Shinto shrine (for example, on maps) is .

==Etymology==
 is the most general name for shrine. Any place that owns a is a &quot;jinja&quot;. These two characters used to be read either &quot;kamu-tsu-yashiro&quot; or &quot;mori&quot; in kunyomi, both meaning &quot;kami grove&quot;. Both readings can be found for example in the Man&#x27;yōshū.

 itself was not an initially secular term. In Chinese it alone historically could refer to Tudigong, or soil gods, a kind of tutelary deity seen as subordinate to City Gods. Such deities are also often called (), or the same characters in the reverse order. Its Kunyomi reading is a generic term for shinto shrine like &quot;jinja&quot;.

It is also used as a suffix , as in &quot;Shinmei-sha&quot; or &quot;Tenjin-ja&quot;, indicates a minor shrine that has received through the &quot;kanjō&quot; process a &quot;kami&quot; from a more important one.

A is a place where a &quot;kami&quot; is present. It can therefore be a shrine and, in fact, the characters 神社, 社 and 杜 can all be read &quot;mori&quot; (&quot;grove&quot;). This reading reflects the fact the first shrines were simply sacred groves or forests where &quot;kami&quot; were present.

 is an extremely small shrine of the kind one finds for example along country roads. The term , believed to have been one of the first Japanese words for Shinto shrine, evolved from , literally meaning &quot;kami repository&quot;, a fact that seems to indicate that the first shrines were huts built to house some &quot;yorishiro&quot;.

 indicates a shrine enshrining an imperial prince, but there are many examples in which it is used simply as a tradition. The word often found at the end of names of shrines such as Hachimangu, Tenmangū, or comes from the Chinese () meaning palace or a temple to a high deity. 

 is a shrine of particularly high status that has a deep relationship with the Imperial household or enshrines an Emperor, as for example in the case of the Ise Jingū and the Meiji Jingū. The name &quot;Jingū&quot; alone, can refer only to the Ise Jingū, whose official name is just &quot;Jingū&quot;.

During the Japanese Middle Ages, shrines started being called with the name , a term of Buddhist origin. For example, in Eastern Japan there are still many Hakusan shrines where the shrine itself is called &quot;gongen&quot;. Because it represents the application of Buddhist terminology to Shinto &quot;kami&quot;, its use was legally abolished by the Meiji government with the , and shrines began to be called &quot;jinja&quot;.

==History==

=== Early origins ===

Ancestors are &quot;kami&quot; to be worshipped. Yayoi period village councils sought the advice of ancestors and other &quot;kami&quot;, and developed instruments, , to evoke them. &quot;Yoshishiro&quot; means &quot;approach substitute&quot; and were conceived to attract the &quot;kami&quot; to allow them physical space, thus making &quot;kami&quot; accessible to human beings.

Village council sessions were held in quiet spots in the mountains or in forests near great trees or other natural objects that served as &quot;yorishiro&quot;. These sacred places and their &quot;yorishiro&quot; gradually evolved into today&#x27;s shrines, whose origins can be still seen in the Japanese words for &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;forest&quot;, which can also mean &quot;shrine&quot;. Many shrines have on their grounds one of the original great &quot;yorishiro&quot;: a big tree, surrounded by a sacred rope called .

The first buildings at places dedicated to worship were hut-like structures built to house some &quot;yorishiro&quot;. A trace of this origin can be found in the term , &quot;deity storehouse&quot;, which evolved into &quot;hokora&quot; (written with the same characters 神庫) and is considered to be one of the first words for shrine.

===First temporary shrines===
True shrines arose with the beginning of agriculture, when the need arose to attract &quot;kami&quot; to ensure good harvests. These were, however, just temporary structures built for a particular purpose, a tradition of which traces can be found in some rituals.

Hints of the first shrines can still be found. Ōmiwa Shrine in Nara, for example, contains no sacred images or objects because it is believed to serve the mountain on which it stands—images or objects are therefore unnecessary. For the same reason, it has a worship hall, a , but no place to house the &quot;kami&quot;, called . Archeology confirms that, during the Yayoi period, the most common (a &quot;yorishiro&quot; actually housing the enshrined &quot;kami&quot;) in the earliest shrines were nearby mountain peaks that supplied stream water to the plains where people lived. 

Besides Ōmiwa Shrine, another important example is Mount Nantai, a phallus-shaped mountain in Nikko which constitutes Futarasan Shrine&#x27;s &quot;shintai&quot;. The name means &quot;man&#x27;s body&quot;. The mountain provides water to the rice paddies below and has the shape of the phallic stone rods found in pre-agricultural Jōmon sites.

=== First known shrine ===
The first known Shinto shrine was built in roughly 478.

===Rites and ceremonies===

In 905 CE, Emperor Daigo ordered a compilation of Shinto rites and rules. Previous attempts at codification are known to have taken place, but, neither the &quot;Konin&quot; nor the &quot;Jogan Gishiki&quot; survive. Initially under the direction of Fujiwara no Tokihira, the project stalled at his death in April 909. Fujiwara no Tadahira, his brother, took charge and in 912 and in 927 the Engi-shiki (延喜式, literally: &quot;Procedures of the Engi Era&quot;) was promulgated in fifty volumes. 

This, the first formal codification of Shinto rites and Norito (liturgies and prayers) to survive, became the basis for all subsequent Shinto liturgical practice and efforts. In addition to the first ten volumes of this fifty volume work, which concerned worship and the Department of Worship, sections in subsequent volumes addressing the Ministry of Ceremonies (治部省) and the Ministry of the Imperial Household (宮内省) regulated Shinto worship and contained liturgical rites and regulation. In 1970, Felicia Gressitt Brock published a two-volume annotated English language translation of the first ten volumes with an introduction entitled &quot;Engi-shiki; procedures of the Engi Era&quot;.

==Arrival and influence of Buddhism==

The arrival of Buddhism in Japan in around the sixth century introduced the concept of a permanent shrine. A great number of Buddhist temples were built next to existing shrines in mixed complexes called to help priesthood deal with local &quot;kami&quot;, making those shrines permanent. Some time in their evolution, the word , meaning &quot;palace&quot;, came into use indicating that shrines had by then become the imposing structures of today.

Once the first permanent shrines were built, Shinto revealed a strong tendency to resist architectural change, a tendency which manifested itself in the so-called , the tradition of rebuilding shrines faithfully at regular intervals adhering strictly to their original design. This custom is the reason ancient styles have been replicated throughout the centuries to the present day, remaining more or less intact. 

Ise Grand Shrine, still rebuilt every 20 years, is its best extant example. In Shinto it has played a particularly significant role in preserving ancient architectural styles. Izumo Taisha, Sumiyoshi Taisha, and Nishina Shinmei Shrine each represent a different style whose origin is believed to predate Buddhism in Japan. These three styles are known respectively as &quot;taisha-zukuri&quot;, &quot;sumiyoshi-zukuri&quot;, and &quot;shinmei-zukuri&quot;.

Shrines show various influences, particularly that of Buddhism, a cultural import which provided much of Shinto architecture&#x27;s vocabulary. The , the &quot;haiden&quot;, the , the &quot;tōrō&quot;, or stone lantern, and the &quot;komainu&quot;, or lion dogs, are all elements borrowed from Buddhism.

===&quot;Shinbutsu shūgō&quot; and the &quot;jingūji&quot;===
Until the Meiji period (1868–1912), shrines as they exist today were rare. With very few exceptions like Ise Grand Shrine and Izumo Taisha, they were just a part of a temple-shrine complex controlled by Buddhist clergy. These complexes were called , places of worship composed of a Buddhist temple and of a shrine dedicated to a local &quot;kami&quot;. 

The complexes were born when a temple was erected next to a shrine to help its &quot;kami&quot; with its karmic problems. At the time, &quot;kami&quot; were thought to be also subjected to karma, and therefore in need of a salvation only Buddhism could provide. Having first appeared during the Nara period (710–794), the &quot;jingū-ji&quot; remained common for over a millennium until, with few exceptions, they were destroyed in compliance with the new policies of the Meiji administration in 1868.

===&quot;Shinbutsu bunri&quot;===

The Shinto shrine went through a massive change when the Meiji administration promulgated a new policy of separation of &quot;kami&quot; and foreign Buddhas (&quot;shinbutsu bunri&quot;) with the . This event triggered the &quot;haibutsu kishaku&quot;, a violent anti-Buddhist movement which in the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate and during the Meiji Restoration caused the forcible closure of thousands of Buddhist temples, the confiscation of their land, the forced return to lay life of monks, and the destruction of books, statues and other Buddhist property.

Until the end of Edo period, local &quot;kami&quot; beliefs and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called &quot;shinbutsu shūgō&quot; (神仏習合), up to the point where even the same buildings were used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples.

After the law, the two would be forcibly separated. This was done in several stages. At first an order issued by the &quot;Jingijimuka&quot; in April 1868 ordered the defrocking of &quot;shasō&quot; and &quot;bettō&quot; (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the &#x27;Daijōkan&#x27; banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as &quot;gongen&quot; to Japanese &quot;kami&quot; and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. 

The third stage consisted of the prohibition against applying the Buddhist term &quot;Daibosatsu&quot; (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic &quot;kami&quot; Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū and Usa Hachiman-gū shrines. In the fourth and final stage, all the defrocked &quot;bettō&quot; and &quot;shasō&quot; were told to become &quot;shrine priests&quot; (&quot;kannushi&quot;) and return to their shrines. Monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as &quot;kami&quot;.

After a short period in which it enjoyed popular favor, the process of separation of Buddhas and &quot;kami&quot; however stalled and is still only partially completed. To this day, almost all Buddhist temples in Japan have a small shrine (&quot;chinjusha&quot;) dedicated to its Shinto tutelary &quot;kami&quot;, and vice versa Buddhist figures (e.g. goddess Kannon) are revered in Shinto shrines.

==&quot;Shintai&quot;==
The defining features of a shrine are the &quot;kami&quot; it enshrines and the &quot;shintai&quot; (or &quot;go-shintai&quot; if the honorific prefix &quot;go-&quot; is used) that houses it. While the name literally means &quot;body of a kami&quot;, &quot;shintai&quot; are physical objects worshiped at or near Shinto shrines because a &quot;kami&quot; is believed to reside in them. &quot;Shintai&quot; are not themselves part of &quot;kami&quot;, but rather just symbolic repositories which make them accessible to human beings for worship; the &quot;kami&quot; inhabits them. &quot;Shintai&quot; are also of necessity &quot;yorishiro&quot;, that is objects by their very nature capable of attracting &quot;kami&quot;.

The most common &quot;shintai&quot; are objects like mirrors, swords, jewels (for example comma-shaped stones called &quot;magatama&quot;), &quot;gohei&quot; (wands used during religious rites), and sculptures of &quot;kami&quot; called , but they can be also natural objects such as rocks, mountains, trees, and waterfalls. Mountains were among the first, and are still among the most important, &quot;shintai&quot;, and are worshiped at several famous shrines. A mountain believed to house a &quot;kami&quot;, as for example Mount Fuji or Mount Miwa, is called a . In the case of a man-made &quot;shintai&quot;, a &quot;kami&quot; must be invited to reside in it.

The founding of a new shrine requires the presence of either a pre-existing, naturally occurring &quot;shintai&quot; (for example a rock or waterfall housing a local &quot;kami&quot;), or of an artificial one, which must therefore be procured or made to the purpose. An example of the first case are the Nachi Falls, worshiped at Hiryū Shrine near Kumano Nachi Taisha and believed to be inhabited by a &quot;kami&quot; called Hiryū Gongen.

The first duty of a shrine is to house and protect its &quot;shintai&quot; and the &quot;kami&quot; which inhabits it. If a shrine has more than one building, the one containing the &quot;shintai&quot; is called &quot;honden&quot;; because it is meant for the exclusive use of the &quot;kami&quot;, it is always closed to the public and is not used for prayer or religious ceremonies. The &quot;shintai&quot; leaves the &quot;honden&quot; only during festivals (&quot;matsuri&quot;), when it is put in portable shrines (&quot;mikoshi&quot;) and carried around the streets among the faithful. The portable shrine is used to physically protect the &quot;shintai&quot; and to hide it from sight.

===Re-enshrinement===

Often the opening of a new shrine will require the ritual division of a &quot;kami&quot; and the transferring of one of the two resulting spirits to the new location, where it will animate the &quot;shintai&quot;. This process is called &quot;kanjō&quot;, and the divided spirits , , or . This process of propagation, described by the priests, in spite of this name, not as a division but as akin to the lighting of a candle from another already lit, leaves the original &quot;kami&quot; intact in its original place and therefore does not alter any of its properties. The resulting spirit has all the qualities of the original and is therefore &quot;alive&quot; and permanent. The process is used often—for example during Shinto festivals (&quot;matsuri&quot;) to animate temporary shrines called &quot;mikoshi&quot;.

The transfer does not necessarily take place from a shrine to another: the divided spirit&#x27;s new location can be a privately owned object or an individual&#x27;s house. The &quot;kanjō&quot; process was of fundamental importance in the creation of all of Japan&#x27;s shrine networks (Inari shrines, Hachiman shrines, etc.).

== &quot;Shake&quot; families ==

The &quot;shake&quot; (社家) are families and the former social class that dominated Shinto shrines through hereditary positions within a shrine. The social class was abolished in 1871, but many &quot;shake&quot; families still continue hereditary succession until present day and some were appointed hereditary nobility (&quot;Kazoku&quot;) after the Meiji Restoration.

Some of the most well-known &quot;shake&quot; families include:
* Arakida and Watarai of Ise Grand Shrine
* Senge and Kitajima of Izumo Taisha
* Ōnakatomi of Kasuga Taisha
* Urabe of Yoshida Shrine

==Famous shrines and shrine networks==
Those worshiped at a shrine are generally Shinto &quot;kami&quot;, but sometimes they can be Buddhist or Taoist deities, as well as others not generally considered to belong to Shinto. Some shrines were established to worship living people or figures from myths and legends. An example is the Tōshō-gū shrines erected to enshrine Tokugawa Ieyasu, or the many shrines dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, like Kitano Tenman-gū.
Often the shrines which were most significant historically do not lie in a former center of power like Kyoto, Nara, or Kamakura. For example, Ise Grand Shrine, the Imperial household&#x27;s family shrine, is in Mie prefecture. Izumo-taisha, one of the oldest and most revered shrines in Japan, is in Shimane Prefecture. This is because their location is that of a traditionally important &quot;kami&quot;, and not that of temporal institutions.

Some shrines exist only in one locality, while others are at the head of a network of . The spreading of a &quot;kami&quot; can be evoked by one or more of several different mechanisms. The typical one is an operation called &quot;kanjō&quot;, a propagation process through which a &quot;kami&quot; is invited to a new location and there re-enshrined. The new shrine is administered completely independent from the one it originated from.

However, other transfer mechanisms exist. In Ise Grand Shrine&#x27;s case, for example, its network of Shinmei shrines (from Shinmei, 神明; another name for Amaterasu) grew due to two concurrent causes. During the late Heian period the cult of Amaterasu, worshiped initially only at Ise Grand Shrine, started to spread to the shrine&#x27;s possessions through the usual &quot;kanjō&quot; mechanism. 

Later, branch shrines started to appear further away. The first evidence of a Shinmei shrine far from Ise is given by the &quot;Azuma Kagami&quot;, a Kamakura-period text which refers to Amanawa Shinmei-gū&#x27;s appearance in Kamakura, Kanagawa. Amaterasu began to be worshiped in other parts of the country because of the so-called phenomenon, the belief that she would fly to other locations and settle there. Similar mechanisms have been responsible for the spreading around the country of other &quot;kami&quot;.

===Notable shrines===
The Ise Grand Shrine in Mie prefecture is, with Izumo-taisha, the most representative and historically significant shrine in Japan. The &quot;kami&quot; the two enshrine play fundamental roles in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, two texts of great importance to Shinto. Because its &quot;kami&quot;, Amaterasu, is an ancestor of the Emperor, Ise Grand Shrine is the Imperial Household&#x27;s family shrine. Ise Grand Shrine is dedicated specifically to the emperor. In the past, even his mother, wife and grandmother needed his permission to worship there. Its traditional and mythological foundation date goes back to 4 BCE, but historians believe it was founded around the 3rd to 5th century CE.

Izumo Taisha in Shimane Prefecture is so old that no document about its origin survives, and the year of foundation is unknown. The shrine is the center of a series of sagas and myths. The &quot;kami&quot; it enshrines, Ōkuninushi, created Japan before it was populated by Amaterasu&#x27;s offspring, the Emperor&#x27;s ancestors. Because of its physical remoteness, in historical times Izumo has been eclipsed in fame by other sites, but there is still a widespread belief that in October all Japanese gods meet there. For this reason, October is also known as the , while at Izumo Taisha alone it is referred to as the .
Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of the largest shrine network in Japan, which has more than 32,000 members, about a third of the total. Inari Okami worship started here in the 8th century and has continued ever since, expanding to the rest of the country. Located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, the shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named Inari and includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines. Another very large example is the Yūtoku Inari Shrine in Kashima City, Saga Prefecture.

Ōita Prefecture&#x27;s Usa Shrine, called in Japanese Usa Jingū or Usa Hachiman-gū, is together with Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū, the head of the Hachiman shrine network. Hachiman worship started here at least as far back as the Nara period (710–794). In 860, the &quot;kami&quot; was divided and brought to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū in Kyoto, which became the focus of Hachiman worship in the capital. Located on top of Mount Otokoyama, Usa Hachiman-gū is dedicated to Emperor Ōjin, his mother Empress Jingū, and female &quot;kami&quot; Hime no Okami.

Itsukushima Shrine is, together with Munakata Taisha, at the head of the Munakata shrine network. Remembered for its &quot;torii&quot; raising from the waters, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The shrine is dedicated to the three daughters of Susano-o no Mikoto, &quot;kami&quot; of seas and storms and brother of the great sun &quot;kami&quot;.

Kasuga Taisha is a Shinto shrine in the city of Nara, in Nara Prefecture, Japan. Established in 768 AD and rebuilt several times over the centuries, it is the shrine of the Fujiwara family. The interior is noted for its many bronze lanterns, as well as the many stone lanterns that lead up the shrine. The architectural style &quot;Kasuga-zukuri&quot; takes its name from Kasuga Taisha&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot;.
The Kumano Sanzan shrine complex, head of the Kumano shrine network, includes Kumano Hayatama Taisha (Wakayama Prefecture, Shingu), Kumano Hongu Taisha (Wakayama Prefecture, Tanabe), and Kumano Nachi Taisha (Wakayama Prefecture, Nachikatsuura). The shrines lie between 20 and 40 km one from the other. They are connected by the pilgrimage route known as . The great Kumano Sanzan complex also includes two Buddhist temples, Seiganto-ji and Fudarakusan-ji.

The religious significance of the Kumano region goes back to prehistoric times and predates all modern religions in Japan. The area was, and still is, considered a place of physical healing.

Yasukuni shrine, in Tokyo, is dedicated to the soldiers and others who died fighting on behalf of the Emperor of Japan.

San Marino Jinja in Serravalle, San Marino, is the first Shinto shrine in Europe.

===Shrine networks===
There are an estimated 80,000 shrines in Japan. The majority of Shinto shrines are associated with a shrine network. This number includes only shrines with resident priests. If smaller shrines, such as roadside or household shrines are included, the number would be twice the amount. These are highly concentrated. Over one-third, 30,000, are associated with Inari. The top six networks comprise over 90% of all shrines. There are at least 20 networks with over 200 shrines.
The next ten largest networks contain between 2,000 branches down to about 200 branches, and include the networks headed by Matsunoo-taisha, Kibune Shrine, and Taga-taisha, among others.

====Inari shrines====

The number of branch shrines gives an approximate indication of their religious significance, and neither Ise Grand Shrine nor Izumo-taisha can claim the first place. By far the most numerous are shrines dedicated to Inari, tutelary &quot;kami&quot; of agriculture popular all over Japan, which alone constitute almost a third of the total. Inari protects fishing, commerce, and productivity in general. Many modern Japanese corporations have shrines dedicated to Inari on their premises. Inari shrines are usually very small and easy to maintain, but can be very large, as in the case of Fushimi Inari Taisha, the head shrine of the network. The &quot;kami&quot; is enshrined in some Buddhist temples.

The entrance to an Inari shrine is usually marked by one or more vermilion &quot;torii&quot; and two white foxes. This red color has come to be identified with Inari because of the prevalence of its use among Inari shrines and their &quot;torii&quot;. The &quot;kitsune&quot; statues are at times mistakenly believed to be a form assumed by Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female, although sex is usually not obvious. These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw – most often a jewel and a key, but a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are common. Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking, on the altar, or in front of the main sanctuary.

====Hachiman shrines====
A syncretic entity worshiped as both a &quot;kami&quot; and a Buddhist &quot;daibosatsu&quot;, Hachiman is intimately associated with both learning and warriors. In the sixth or seventh century, Emperor Ōjin and his mother Empress Jingū came to be identified together with Hachiman. First enshrined at Usa Hachiman-gū in Ōita Prefecture, Hachiman was deeply revered during the Heian period. According to the Kojiki, it was Ōjin who invited Korean and Chinese scholars to Japan, and for this reason he is the patron of writing and learning.

Because as Emperor Ōjin he was an ancestor of the Minamoto clan, Hachiman became the of the Minamoto samurai clan of Kawachi (Osaka). After Minamoto no Yoritomo became &quot;shōgun&quot; and established the Kamakura shogunate, Hachiman&#x27;s popularity grew, and he became by extension the protector of the warrior class the &quot;shōgun&quot; had brought to power. For this reason, the &quot;shintai&quot; of a Hachiman shrine is usually a stirrup or a bow.

During the Japanese medieval period, Hachiman worship spread throughout Japan among samurai and the peasantry. There are 25,000 shrines in Japan dedicated to him, the second most numerous after those of the Inari network. Usa Hachiman-gū is the network&#x27;s head shrine together with Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū. However, Hakozaki Shrine and Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū are historically no less significant shrines and are more popular.

====Shinmei shrines====

While the ritsuryō legal system was in use, visits by commoners to Ise were forbidden. With its weakening during the Heian period, commoners started being allowed in the shrine. The growth of the Shinmei shrine network was due to two concomitant causes. During the late Heian period, goddess Amaterasu, worshiped initially only at Ise Grand Shrine, started to be re-enshrined in branch shrines in Ise&#x27;s own possessions through the typical &quot;kanjō&quot; mechanism. The first evidence of a Shinmei shrine elsewhere is given by the Azuma Kagami, a Kamakura period text which refers to Amanawa Shinmei-gū&#x27;s appearance in Kamakura. Amaterasu spread to other parts of the country because of the so-called phenomenon, the belief that Amaterasu flew to other locations and settled there.

====Tenjin shrines====
The Tenjin shrine network enshrines 9th-century scholar Sugawara no Michizane. Sugawara had originally been enshrined to placate his spirit, not to be worshiped. Michizane had been unjustly exiled in his life, and it was necessary to somehow placate his rage, believed to be the cause of a plague and other disasters. Kitano Tenman-gū was the first of the shrines dedicated to him. Because in life he was a scholar, he became the &quot;kami&quot; of learning, and during the Edo period schools often opened a branch shrine for him. Another important shrine dedicated to him is Dazaifu Tenman-gū.

====Munakata shrines====
Headed by Kyūshū&#x27;s Munakata Taisha and Itsukushima Shrine, shrines in this network enshrine the , namely Chikishima Hime-no-Kami, Tagitsu Hime-no-Kami, and Tagori Hime-no-Kami. The same three &quot;kami&quot; are enshrined elsewhere in the network, sometimes under a different name. However, while Munakata Taisha enshrines all three in separate islands belonging to its complex, branch shrines generally do not. Which &quot;kami&quot; they enshrine depends on the history of the shrine and the myths tied to it.

==== Suwa Shrines ====
Suwa Shrines are branch shrines of Suwa Taisha.

==== Hiyoshi shrines ====
Hiyoshi shrines are branch shrines of Hiyoshi Taisha. They have origins in Sannō Ichijitsu Shintō and worship Oyamakui no Kami.

====Kumano shrines====

Kumano shrines enshrine the three Kumano mountains: Hongū, Shingū, and Nachi (the ). The point of origin of the Kumano cult is the Kumano Sanzan shrine complex, which includes (Wakayama Prefecture, Shingu), Kumano Hongu Taisha (Wakayama Prefecture, Tanabe), and Kumano Nachi Taisha (Wakayama Prefecture, Nachikatsuura). There are more than 3,000 Kumano shrines in Japan.

==== Gion Shrines ====

Gion shrines are branch shrines of Tsushima Shrine, Yasaka Shrine or Hiromine Shrine. Historically associated with Gozu Tenno, they became dedicated to Susanoo during the separation of Shinto and Buddhism.

==Structure==
The following is a list and diagram illustrating the most important parts of a Shinto shrine:
#&quot;Torii&quot; – Shinto gate
#Stone stairs
#&quot;Sandō&quot; – the approach to the shrine
#&quot;Chōzuya&quot; or &quot;temizuya&quot; – place of purification to cleanse one&#x27;s hands and mouth
#&quot;Tōrō&quot; – decorative stone lanterns
#&quot;Kagura-den&quot; – building dedicated to &quot;Noh&quot; or the sacred &quot;kagura&quot; dance
#&quot;Shamusho&quot; – the shrine&#x27;s administrative office
#&quot;Ema&quot; – wooden plaques bearing prayers or wishes
#&quot;Sessha&quot;/&quot;massha&quot; – small auxiliary shrines
#&quot;Komainu&quot; – the so-called &quot;lion dogs&quot;, guardians of the shrine
#&quot;Haiden&quot; – oratory or hall of worship
#&quot;Tamagaki&quot; – fence surrounding the &quot;honden&quot;
#&quot;Honden&quot; – main hall, enshrining the kami
#On the roof of the &quot;haiden&quot; and &quot;honden&quot; are visible &quot;chigi&quot; (forked roof finials) and &quot;katsuogi&quot; (short horizontal logs), both common shrine ornamentations.

The general blueprint of a Shinto shrine is Buddhist in origin. The presence of verandas, stone lanterns, and elaborate gates is an example of this influence. The composition of a Shinto shrine is extremely variable, and none of its many possible features is necessarily present. Even the &quot;honden&quot; can be missing if the shrine worships a nearby natural &quot;shintai&quot;.

Since its grounds are sacred, they are usually surrounded by a fence made of stone or wood called &quot;tamagaki&quot;. Access is made possible by an approach called &quot;sandō&quot;. The entrances are straddled by gates called &quot;torii&quot;, which are usually the simplest way to identify a Shinto shrine.
A shrine may include within its grounds several structures, each built for a different purpose. Among them are the &quot;honden&quot; or sanctuaries, where the &quot;kami&quot; are enshrined, the &quot;heiden&quot; or hall of offerings, where offers and prayers are presented, and the &quot;haiden&quot; or hall of worship, where there may be seats for worshippers. The &quot;honden&quot; is the building that contains the &quot;shintai&quot;, literally, &quot;the sacred body of the kami&quot;. 

Of these, only the &quot;haiden&quot; is open to the laity. The &quot;honden&quot; is usually located behind the &quot;haiden&quot; and is often much smaller and unadorned. Other notable shrine features are the &quot;temizuya&quot;, the fountain where visitors cleanse their hands and mouth, and the , the office which oversees the shrine. Buildings are often adorned by &quot;chigi&quot; and &quot;katsuogi&quot;, variously oriented poles which protrude from their roof.

Before the Meiji Restoration it was common for a Buddhist temple to be built inside or next to a shrine, or vice versa. If a shrine housed a Buddhist temple, it was called a . Analogously, temples all over Japan adopted and built to house them. After the forcible separation of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines (shinbutsu bunri) ordered by the new government in the Meiji period, the connection between the two religions was officially severed, but continued nonetheless in practice and is still visible today.

==Architectural styles==

Shrine buildings can have many different basic layouts, usually named either after a famous shrine&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot; (e.g. &quot;hiyoshi-zukuri&quot;, named after Hiyoshi Taisha), or a structural characteristic (e.g., &quot;irimoya-zukuri&quot;, after the hip-and gable roof it adopts. The suffix &quot;-zukuri&quot; in this case means &quot;structure&quot;.)

The &quot;honden&quot;″s roof is always gabled, and some styles have a veranda-like aisle called &quot;hisashi&quot; (a 1-&quot;ken&quot; wide corridor surrounding one or more sides of the core of a shrine or temple). Among the factors involved in the classification, important are the presence or absence of:
* – a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof&#x27;s ridge (non gabled-side). The &quot;shinmei-zukuri&quot;, &quot;nagare-zukuri&quot;, &quot;hachiman-zukuri&quot;, and &quot;hie-zukuri&quot; belong to this type.
* – a style of construction in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs perpendicular to the roof&#x27;s ridge (gabled side). The &quot;taisha-zukuri&quot;, &quot;sumiyoshi-zukuri&quot;, &quot;ōtori-zukuri&quot; and &quot;kasuga-zukuri&quot; belong to this type.

Proportions are important. A building of a given style often must have certain proportions measured in &quot;ken&quot; (the distance between pillars, a quantity variable from one shrine to another or even within the same shrine).

The oldest styles are the &quot;tsumairi&quot; &quot;shinmei-zukuri&quot;, &quot;taisha-zukuri&quot;, and &quot;sumiyoshi-zukuri&quot;, believed to predate the arrival of Buddhism.

The two most common are the &quot;hirairi&quot; &quot;nagare-zukuri&quot; and the &quot;tsumairi&quot; &quot;kasuga-zukuri&quot;. Larger, more important shrines tend to have unique styles.

===Most common styles===
The following are the two most common shrine styles in Japan.

====&quot;Nagare-zukuri&quot;====

The or is a style characterized by a very asymmetrical gabled roof ( in Japanese) projecting outwards on the non-gabled side, above the main entrance, to form a portico. 

This is the feature which gives the style its name, the most common among shrines all over Japan. Sometimes the basic layout consisting of an elevated partially surrounded by a veranda called &quot;hisashi&quot; (all under the same roof) is modified by the addition of a room in front of the entrance. 

The &quot;honden&quot; varies in roof ridge length from 1 to 11 &quot;ken&quot;, but is never 6 or 8 &quot;ken&quot;. The most common sizes are 1 and 3 &quot;ken&quot;. The oldest shrine in Japan, Uji&#x27;s Ujigami Shrine, has a &quot;honden&quot; of this type. Its external dimensions are 5×3 &quot;ken&quot;, but internally it is composed of three measuring 1 &quot;ken&quot; each.
====&quot;Kasuga-zukuri&quot;====
 as a style takes its name from Kasuga Taisha&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot;. It is characterized by the extreme smallness of the building, just 1×1 &quot;ken&quot; in size. In Kasuga Taisha&#x27;s case, this translates in 1.9 m × 2.6 m. The roof is gabled with a single entrance at the gabled end, decorated with &quot;chigi&quot; and &quot;katsuogi&quot;, covered with cypress bark and curved upwards at the eaves. Supporting structures are painted vermillion, while the plank walls are white.

After the &quot;Nagare-zukuri&quot;, this is the most common style, with most instances in the Kansai region around Nara.

===Styles predating the arrival of Buddhism===

The following four styles predate the arrival in Japan of Buddhism:

====Primitive shrine layout with no &quot;honden&quot;====
Unique in that the &quot;honden&quot; is missing, it is believed shrines of this type are reminiscent of what shrines were like in prehistorical times. The first shrines had no &quot;honden&quot; because the &quot;shintai&quot;, or object of worship, was the mountain on which they stood. An extant example is Nara&#x27;s Ōmiwa Shrine, which still has no &quot;honden&quot;. An area near the &quot;haiden&quot; (hall of worship), sacred and taboo, replaces it for worship. Another prominent example of this style is Futarasan Shrine near Nikkō, whose &quot;shintai&quot; is Mount Nantai.

====&quot;Shinmei-zukuri&quot;====

 is an ancient style typical of, and most common at, Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest of Shinto shrines. It is most common in Mie prefecture. Characterized by an extreme simplicity, its basic features can be seen in Japanese architecture from the Kofun period (250–538 CE) onwards and it is considered the pinnacle of Japanese traditional architecture. Built in planed, unfinished wood, the &quot;honden&quot; is either 3×2 &quot;ken&quot; or 1×1 &quot;ken&quot; in size, has a raised floor, a gabled roof with an entry on one of the non-gabled sides, no upward curve at the eaves, and decorative logs called &quot;chigi&quot; and &quot;katsuogi&quot; protruding from the roof&#x27;s ridge. The oldest extant example is Nishina Shinmei Shrine.

====&quot;Sumiyoshi-zukuri&quot;====

 takes its name from Sumiyoshi Taisha&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot; in Ōsaka. The building is 4 &quot;ken&quot; wide and 2 &quot;ken&quot; deep and has an entrance under the gable. Its interior is divided in two sections, one at the and one at the with a single entrance at the front. Construction is simple, but the pillars are painted in vermilion and the walls in white.

The style is supposed to have its origin in old palace architecture. Another example of this style is Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the Sumiyoshi Sanjin complex in Fukuoka Prefecture. In both cases, as in many others, there is no veranda.

====&quot;Taisha-zukuri&quot;====
 is the oldest shrine style, takes its name from Izumo Taisha and, like Ise Grand Shrine&#x27;s, has &quot;chigi&quot; and &quot;katsuogi&quot;, plus archaic features like gable-end pillars and a single central pillar (&quot;shin no mihashira&quot;). Because its floor is raised on stilts, it is believed to have its origin in raised-floor granaries similar to those found in Toro, Shizuoka prefecture.

The &quot;honden&quot; normally has a 2×2 &quot;ken&quot; footprint (12.46 × 12.46 m in Izumo Taisha&#x27;s case), with an entrance on the gabled end. The stairs to the honden are covered by a cypress bark roof. The oldest extant example of the style is Kamosu Jinja&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot; in Shimane Prefecture, built in the 16th century.

===Other styles===
Many other architectural styles exist, most of them rare.

==Interpreting shrine names==

Shrine nomenclature has changed considerably since the Meiji period. Until then, the vast majority of shrines were small and had no permanent priest. With very few exceptions, they were just a part of a temple-shrine complex controlled by Buddhist clergy. 

They usually enshrined a local tutelary &quot;kami&quot;, so they were called with the name of the &quot;kami&quot; followed by terms like &quot;gongen&quot;; , short for &quot;ubusuna no kami&quot;, or guardian deity of one&#x27;s birthplace; or . The term , now the most common, was rare. Examples of this kind of pre-Meiji use are Tokusō Daigongen and Kanda Myōjin.

Today, the term &quot;Shinto shrine&quot; in English is used in opposition to &quot;Buddhist temple&quot; to mirror in English the distinction made in Japanese between Shinto and Buddhist religious structures. This single English word translates several non-equivalent Japanese words, including as in Yasukuni Jinja; as in Tsubaki Ōkami Yashiro; as in Watarai no Miya; as in Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū; as in Meiji Jingū; as in Izumo Taisha; ; and .

Shrine names are descriptive. A problem in dealing with them is understanding exactly what they mean. Although there is a lot of variation in their composition, it is usually possible to identify in them two parts. The first is the shrine&#x27;s name proper, or , the second is the so-called , or &quot;title&quot;.

===&quot;Meishō&quot;===
The most common &quot;meishō&quot; is the location where the shrine stands, as for example in the case of Ise Jingū, the most sacred of shrines, which is located in the city of Ise, Mie prefecture.

Very often the &quot;meishō&quot; will be the name of the &quot;kami&quot; enshrined. An Inari Shrine for example is a shrine dedicated to &quot;kami&quot; Inari. Analogously, a Kumano Shrine is a shrine that enshrines the three Kumano mountains. A Hachiman Shrine enshrines &quot;kami&quot; Hachiman. Tokyo&#x27;s Meiji Shrine enshrines the Meiji Emperor. The name can also have other origins, often unknown or unclear.

===&quot;Shōgō&quot;===
The second part of the name defines the status of the shrine.
* is the most general name for shrine. Any place that owns a is a &quot;jinja&quot;. These two characters used to be read either &quot;kamu-tsu-yashiro&quot; or &quot;mori&quot;, both meaning &quot;kami grove&quot;. Both readings can be found for example in the Man&#x27;yōshū.
* is a generic term for shinto shrine like &quot;jinja&quot;.
* A is a place where a &quot;kami&quot; is present. It can therefore be a shrine and the characters 神社, 社 and 杜 can all be read &quot;mori&quot; (&quot;grove&quot;). This reading reflects the fact the first shrines were simply sacred groves or Chinju no Mori where &quot;kami&quot; were present.
* The suffix , as in &quot;Shinmei-sha&quot; or &quot;Tenjin-ja&quot;, indicates a minor shrine that has received through the &quot;kanjō&quot; process a &quot;kami&quot; from a more important one.
* is an extremely small shrine of the kind one finds for example along country roads.
* is a shrine of particularly high status that has a deep relationship with the Imperial household or enshrines an Emperor. For example, in the case of the Ise Jingū and the Meiji Jingū. The name &quot;Jingū&quot; alone, can refer only to the Ise Jingū, whose official name is just &quot;Jingū&quot;.
* indicates a shrine enshrining a special &quot;kami&quot; or a member of the Imperial household like the Empress. There are many examples in which it is used simply as a tradition. During the period of state regulation, many &quot;-miya&quot; names were changed to &quot;jinja&quot;.
* indicates a shrine enshrining an imperial prince, but there are many examples in which it is used simply as a tradition.
* A (the characters are also read &quot;ōyashiro&quot;) is literally a &quot;great shrine&quot; that was classified as such under the old system of shrine ranking, the , abolished in 1946. Many shrines carrying that &quot;shōgō&quot; adopted it only after the war.
* During the Japanese Middle Ages, shrines started being called with the name &quot;gongen&quot;, a term of Buddhist origin. For example, in Eastern Japan there are still many Hakusan shrines where the shrine itself is called &quot;gongen&quot;. Because it represents the application of Buddhist terminology to Shinto &quot;kami&quot;, its use was legally abolished by the Meiji government with the , and shrines began to be called &quot;jinja&quot;.

These names are not equivalent in terms of prestige: a &quot;taisha&quot; is more prestigious than a &quot;-gū&quot;, which is more important than a &quot;jinja&quot;.

== Etiquette at shrines ==

At shrines there is a relatively standardized system of visit ettiquette that is called . It goes roughly as follows

# Bow once before entering Torii.
## Do not walk through the center of a Torii as that is reserved for deities.
# Purify hands and mouth with chozuya.
# Put money in the offering box.
# Ring the bell 2-3 times if present.
# Bow twice.
# Clap twice.
# Bow once. This bow should be deeper than the others at a 90-degree angle.
# When exiting the shrine, turn around and again bow once at the Torii.

There are rare exceptions to this system. For example, at Usa Jingū and Izumo-taisha, it is correct etiquette to clap &quot;four&quot; times in front of the offering box rather than the usual twice.

==Officiants==

===&quot;Kannushi&quot;===

A or is a priest responsible for the maintenance of a shrine, as well as for leading worship of a given &quot;kami&quot;. These two terms were not always synonyms. Originally, a &quot;kannushi&quot; was a holy man who could work miracles and who, thanks to purification rites, could work as an intermediary between &quot;kami&quot; and man, but later the term evolved to being synonymous with &quot;shinshoku&quot;, a man who works at a shrine and holds religious ceremonies there. Women can become &quot;kannushi&quot;, and it is common for widows to succeed their husbands.

===&quot;Miko&quot;===
A is a shrine maiden who has trained for and taken up several duties at a shrine including assistance of shrine functions such as the sale of sacred goods, including amulets known as &quot;omamori&quot;, paper talisman known as &quot;ofuda&quot;, wood tablets known as &quot;ema&quot; and among other items, daily tidying of the premises, and performing the sacred kagura dances on certain occasions.

<text>Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) is a technique that stimulates acupressure points by pressuring, tapping or rubbing while focusing on situations that represent personal fear or trauma. EFT draws on various theories of alternative medicine – including acupuncture, neuro-linguistic programming, energy medicine, and Thought Field Therapy (TFT). EFT also combines elements of exposure therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and somatic stimulation. It is best known through Gary Craig&#x27;s &quot;EFT Handbook&quot;, published in the late 1990s, and related books and workshops by a variety of teachers. EFT and similar techniques are often discussed under the umbrella term &quot;energy psychology.&quot;

Advocates claim that the technique may be used to treat a wide variety of physical and psychological disorders, and as a simple form of self-administered therapy. The &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; describes the foundations of EFT as &quot;a hodgepodge of concepts derived from a variety of sources, [primarily] the ancient Chinese philosophy of chi, which is thought to be the &#x27;life force&#x27; that flows throughout the body.&quot; The existence of this life force is &quot;not empirically supported.&quot;

EFT has no benefit as a therapy beyond (1) the placebo effect or (2) any known effective psychological techniques that may be provided in addition to the purported &quot;energy&quot; technique. It is generally characterized as pseudoscience, and it has not garnered significant support in clinical psychology.

==Process==

During a typical EFT session, the person will focus on a specific issue while tapping on &quot;end points of the body&#x27;s energy meridians.&quot; EFT tapping exercises combine elements of cognitive restructuring and exposure techniques with acupoint stimulation. The technique instructs individuals to tap on meridian endpoints of the body – such as the top of the head, eye brows, under eyes, side of eyes, chin, collar bone, and under the arms. While tapping, they recite specific phrases that target an emotional component of a physical symptom.

According to the &quot;EFT Manual&quot;, the procedure consists of the participant rating the emotional intensity of their reaction on a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) – i.e., a Likert scale for subjective measures of distress, calibrated 0 to 10 – then repeating an orienting affirmation while rubbing or tapping specific points on the body. Some practitioners incorporate eye movements or other tasks. The emotional intensity is then rescored and repeated until no changes are noted in the emotional intensity.

==Mechanism==

Proponents of EFT and other similar treatments believe that tapping/stimulating acupuncture points provide the basis for significant improvement in psychological problems. However, the theory and mechanisms underlying the supposed effectiveness of EFT have &quot;no evidentiary support&quot; &quot;in the entire history of the sciences of biology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, physics, or psychology.&quot; Researchers have described the theoretical model for EFT as &quot;frankly bizarre&quot; and &quot;pseudoscientific.&quot; One review noted that one of the highest quality studies found no evidence that the location of tapping points made any difference, and attributed effects to well-known psychological mechanisms, including distraction and breathing therapy.

An article in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; argued that there is no plausible mechanism to explain how the specifics of EFT could add to its effectiveness, and they have been described as unfalsifiable and therefore pseudoscientific. Evidence has not been found for the existence of meridians.

== Research quality ==

EFT has no useful effect as a therapy beyond the placebo effect or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be used with the purported &quot;energy&quot; technique, but proponents of EFT have published material claiming otherwise. Their work, however, is flawed and hence unreliable: high-quality research has never confirmed that EFT is effective.

A 2009 review found &quot;methodological flaws&quot; in research studies that had reported &quot;small successes&quot; for EFT and the related Tapas Acupressure Technique. The review concluded that positive results may be &quot;attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation. Psychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims.&quot;

A 2016 systematic review found that EFT was effective in reducing anxiety compared to controls, but also called for more research to establish the relative efficacy to that of established treatments.

==Reception==

A Delphi poll of an expert panel of psychologists rated EFT on a scale describing how discredited EFT has been in the field of psychology. On average, this panel found EFT had a score of 3.8 on a scale from 1.0 to 5.0, with 3.0 meaning &quot;possibly discredited&quot; and a 4.0 meaning &quot;probably discredited.&quot; A book examining pseudoscientific practices in psychology characterized EFT as one of a number of &quot;fringe psychotherapeutic practices,&quot; and a psychiatry handbook states EFT has &quot;all the hallmarks of pseudoscience.&quot;

EFT, along with its predecessor, Thought Field Therapy, has been dismissed with warnings to avoid their use by publications such as &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; and Quackwatch.

Proponents of EFT and other energy psychology therapies have been &quot;particularly interested&quot; in seeking &quot;scientific credibility&quot; despite the implausible proposed mechanisms for EFT. A 2008 review by energy psychology proponent David Feinstein concluded that energy psychology was a potential &quot;rapid and potent treatment for a range of psychological conditions.&quot; However, this work by Feinstein has been widely criticized. One review criticized Feinstein&#x27;s methodology, noting he ignored several research papers that did not show positive effects of EFT, and that Feinstein did not disclose his conflict of interest as an owner of a website that sells energy psychology products such as books and seminars, contrary to the best practices of research publication.

Another review criticized Feinstein&#x27;s conclusion, which was based on research of weak quality and instead concluded that any positive effects of EFT are due to the more traditional psychological techniques rather than any putative &quot;energy&quot; manipulation. A book published on the subject of evidence-based treatment of substance abuse called Feinstein&#x27;s review &quot;incomplete and misleading&quot; and an example of a poorly performed evidence-based review of research.

Feinstein published another review in 2012, concluding that energy psychology techniques &quot;consistently demonstrated strong effect sizes and other positive statistical results that far exceed chance after relatively few treatment sessions.&quot; This review was also criticized, where again it was noted that Feinstein dismissed higher quality studies which showed no effects of EFT, in favor of methodologically weaker studies which did show a positive effect.

In response to a literature review by D. Feinstein on &quot;Manual Stimulation of Acupuncture Points&quot;, published in 2023 in the &quot;Journal of Psychotherapy Integration&quot;, Cassandra L. Bonessa, Rory Pfundb, and David F. Tolin publish, in the same journal, a critical analysis of 3 meta-analyses highlighted by this study. By using the AMSTAR2 analysis criteria, they come to the conclusion that these were poorly carried out and that their quality is “Critically low”. The three researchers call EFT pseudo-science and an “”.

<doc id="1059399" wikidata="Q3193395" url="?curid=1059399" title="Karl Haas">
<text>Karl Haas (December 6, 1913February 6, 2005) was a German-American classical music radio host, known for his sonorous speaking voice, humanistic approach to music appreciation, and popularization of classical music. He was the host of the classical music radio program &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot;, which was syndicated to commercial and public radio stations around the world. He also published the book &quot;Inside Music&quot;. He was a respected musicologist, as well as an accomplished pianist and conductor. In 1996, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Letters from Oglethorpe University.

==Early life and family==
Haas was born in Speyer, Palatinate, Germany in 1913. He studied at the Mannheim Conservatory and earned a doctorate in music literature from Heidelberg University. He studied piano with Artur Schnabel. Faced with the rise of Nazism, the Jewish Haas fled Germany for the United States in 1936. He first settled in Detroit, Michigan, then lived in other places, returning to Detroit near the end of his life. He and his wife, Trudie, had two sons and one daughter. Trudie died in 1977.

==&quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot;==
Haas began his radio program, &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot;, on WJR in Detroit, Michigan in 1959. Syndicated broadcasts of the show across the United States began in 1970 on WCLV, a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio. The show was eventually syndicated to commercial and public radio stations around the world and became the world&#x27;s most widely heard classical music radio program.

The theme music for &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot; was the second movement from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; Sonata (Sonata No. 8 in C minor), performed by Haas live for each program. He started every show with his trademark greeting &quot;Hello everyone&quot;, and later entitled a track of his CD with those words. For several years the program had the most listeners of any classical music radio show in the world.

Haas received the Charles Frankel Award of the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1991. President George H. W. Bush presented the award to him at the White House. Haas also twice won the George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. In 1997 he became the first classical music broadcaster to be named to the National Radio Hall of Fame.

Haas did not produce any new episodes of the show in the last two years of his life. WCLV continued to syndicate recordings of his previous shows until June 2007. That month, WCLV announced &quot;with great regret&quot; that it would broadcast and syndicate its last &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot; program on June 29, 2007. The announcement explained that the number of stations that carried the show had dropped from more than 400 to fewer than 20, which made it unfeasible to continue the program&#x27;s national distribution.

Most episodes of &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot; are not available publicly because of copyright, which is closely held by his family, although three cassettes/CDs have been issued featuring Haas and his commentary: &quot;The Romantic Piano&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Bells&quot;, and &quot;Song and Dance&quot;. In the 1960s Columbia Records released a Karl Haas commercial LP, &quot;How to Listen to a Symphony,&quot; on their Columbia Special Products label.

==Death==
Near the end of his life, Haas returned to Detroit. He died at the age of 91 on 6 February 2005 at a hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. He was survived by his sons, Jeffrey and Andrew, by his daughter, Alyce, and by two grandchildren.

<doc id="1059402" wikidata="Q335270" url="?curid=1059402" title="James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn">
<text>James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn (24 August 1838 – 3 June 1913), styled Viscount Hamilton until 1868 and Marquess of Hamilton from 1868 to 1885, was a British nobleman, courtier, and diplomat. He was the son of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn, and Lady Louisa Jane Russell.

==Biography==
Lord Hamilton was born in 1838 at Brighton, the eldest son of James Hamilton, second marquess and later first duke of Abercorn (1811–1885), and his wife Lady Louisa Jane Russell (1812–1905), second daughter of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. He was educated, like his father, at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 28 May 1857. After graduating from Oxford with a BA in 1860, he entered Parliament as Conservative MP for County Donegal, a constituency he represented from 1860 to 1880. He took over from his father as Honorary Colonel of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Donegal Militia on 22 September 1860, and retained the position until 1891 when his brother Lord Claud Hamilton (who had been commandant of the regiment) took over. After serving as High Sheriff of Tyrone for 1863, Viscount Hamilton re-entered university and emerged with an M.A. in 1865 (he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath the same year). That year, he also embarked upon a diplomatic mission to Denmark. He served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales from 1866 to 1885; in the latter year, he took over his father&#x27;s position of Lord Lieutenant of County Donegal, and inherited his father&#x27;s peerage titles. He led the Lords&#x27; reply to the Speech from the throne wearing the uniform of Lord Lieutenant of Donegal on 21 January 1886. He was chosen Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1886, a post he held until his death. In 1887 he was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland.

Abercorn held several positions after acceding to that title, including Groom of the Stole to the Prince of Wales (1886–1891), and chairman of the British South Africa Company. In early 1901 he was appointed by King Edward to lead a special diplomatic mission to announce the King&#x27;s accession to the governments of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Russia, Germany and Saxony.

He was created a Knight of the Garter. He died of pneumonia at his house at 61 Green Street, Mayfair, at the age of 74. He is buried in the cemetery at Baronscourt Parish Church, the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Abercorn and their families.

In 1883, he held 76,500 acres in Tyrone and Donegal. He also held 2,100 acres in Scotland.

==Family and children==
In 1869 he married Lady Mary Anna Curzon-Howe (1848–1929), daughter of Anne Gore (bef. 1832–1877), daughter of Adm. Sir John Gore (died 1836), and Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe (1796–1870). Together they had two daughters and seven sons:

*James Albert Edward Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn (1869–1953)
*Lord Claud Penn Alexander Hamilton (18 October 1871 – 18 October 1871) (same day)
*Lord Charlie Hamilton (10 April 1874 – 10 April 1874) (same day)

<text>Lewis Cubitt (29 September 1799 – 9 June 1883) was an English civil engineer and architect.

==Life==

He was a younger brother of Thomas Cubitt, the leading master builder in London in the second quarter of the 19th century, and he designed many of the housing developments constructed by his sibling. He also was a younger brother of William Cubitt, the Lord Mayor of London.

He built many bridges in his career, most of them being in South America, Australia and India. Lewis was jointly responsible for designing the rebuilt London Bridge railway station in 1844. He also designed Bricklayers Arms (1844) and King&#x27;s Cross railway stations (1851–52) and the Great Northern Hotel (1854).

==Legacy==

As part of the ongoing redevelopment of the adjoining railway lands, now known as King&#x27;s Cross Central, a granary designed by Cubitt has been refurbished as the main campus facility for Central Saint Martins, a constituent college of the University of the Arts London. The structural rivet Cubitt used in his development of the granary inspired the hinges used by eyewear brand Cubitts, who are named after the Cubitt brothers.

Lewis Cubbitt Square and Lewis Cubitt Park, in the London Borough of Camden commemorate Cubitt&#x27;s work in the area.
==Family==
He married Sophia Kendall (1811-1879) on 23 January 1830.

<text>Terence Blacker (born 5 February 1948, near Hadleigh, Suffolk) is an English songwriter, author and columnist.

==Biography==
Blacker is the son of General Sir Cecil Blacker, and the brother of sculptor and former jockey Philip Blacker.

He grew up on the family farm in Suffolk. He attended Hawtreys preparatory school and Wellington College, before reading English at Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated in 1969.

Blacker began his working life in horse-racing and as an amateur jockey. Subsequently, he worked in publishing for 10 years during the 1970s and 1980s, where he was responsible for overseeing the publication of works by Jerzy Kosinski.

Blacker became a full-time writer in 1983 and has written children&#x27;s books and mysteries for adults. His first children&#x27;s book, &quot;If I Could Work&quot;, was published in 1987 and his first adult novel, &quot;FIXX&quot;, won critical acclaim and was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;tour de force&quot;. He is an active member of English PEN, and is also an EAW member.

In 1975 he married Caroline Soper, youngest daughter of the radical Methodist minister Donald Soper (div. 2001). They have two children, Xan and Alice. Blacker&#x27;s partner is now Angela Sykes.

He writes the &quot;Endpaper&quot; for &quot;The Author&quot;. For many years, he wrote the &quot;Harvey Porlock&quot; column in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, as well as a column about the book business for &quot;Publishing News&quot;.
His regular writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, newspaper, usually consisting of twice-weekly columns, came to an end in December 2013 after nearly 16 years.

Blacker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2017.

<doc id="1059441" wikidata="Q549506" url="?curid=1059441" title="Antoinette Brown Blackwell">
<text>Antoinette Louisa Brown, later Antoinette Brown Blackwell (May 20, 1825 – November 5, 1921), was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the United States. She was a well-versed public speaker on the paramount issues of her time and distinguished herself from her contemporaries with her use of religious faith in her efforts to expand women&#x27;s rights.

==Early life and education==

Brown was born the youngest of seven in Henrietta, New York, to Joseph Brown and Abby Morse. Brown was recognized as highly intelligent as early as three years old. The preaching of evangelist Charles Grandison Finney from nearby Rochester led Brown&#x27;s family to join the Congregational Church. After daring to inject a prayer into her family&#x27;s religious observance, Brown was accepted into the church before the age of nine. Shortly after becoming a member of the congregation, she began to preach during Sunday meetings. In 1841 at the age of 16, after completing her requisite early schooling at Monroe County Academy, Brown taught school herself. She did not intend to spend her life teaching and so she set her sights on a degree in theology from Oberlin College and a career in the pulpit.

For four years, Antoinette taught school and saved enough money to cover the cost of her tuition at Oberlin College in Ohio. Supported by her parents, who believed not only in equal education for men and women, but also for blacks, she enrolled at Oberlin College in 1846. At the college, she completed the literary course and received her literary degree in 1847, the prescribed course for women students. She spent her vacations in teaching and in the study of Hebrew and Greek. In 1847, after graduating with her bachelor&#x27;s degree, she lobbied the college for admission to the college&#x27;s theological course with its emphasis on Congregationalist ministry. The administration, opposed to the idea of a woman engaging in any kind of formal theological learning and training, eventually capitulated but with a specific set of pre-conditions: Antoinette may enroll in the courses, but she was not to receive formal recognition. Despite the stipulations made regarding her participation in the theology course, Antoinette was a prolific writer and charismatic public speaker. Her exegesis on the writings of the Apostle Paul was published in the &quot;Oberlin Quarterly Review&quot;. It is there, from a brief excerpt, that her understanding of what may now be popularly called feminist theology, takes shape as she writes: &quot;Paul meant only to warn against &#x27;excesses, irregularities, and unwarrantable liberties&#x27; in public worship.&#x27;&quot; She insisted that the Bible and its various pronouncements about women were for a specific span of time and certainly not applicable to the 19th century. Even though women were not asked to do public speaking during this time Antoinette was asked to speak in Ohio and New York to speak about anti-slavery and on women&#x27;s rights. In April 1860, Brown returned to Oberlin College to deliver a lecture entitled &quot;Men and Women.&quot; Testament to Brown&#x27;s oratory skills appeared in a student letter which noted, &quot;it was an excellent lecture.&quot;

==Career==
===Abolition and Ordination===
Without a preaching license following graduation, Brown decided to pause her ministerial ambitions to write for Frederick Douglass&#x27; abolitionist paper, &quot;The North Star&quot;. She spoke in 1850 at the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, giving a speech that was well received and served as the beginning of a speaking tour in which she would address issues such as abolition, temperance, and women&#x27;s rights. Brown spoke at many of the subsequent annual National Women&#x27;s Rights Conventions.

Brown was eventually given a license to preach by the Congregational Church in 1851 and then offered a position as Minister of a Congregationalist church in South Butler, New York in 1852. She temporarily suspended her vast speaking engagements, writing to her friend (and later sister-in-law) Lucy Stone that she had lectured eighteen times in almost as many days, and was ordained by a socially radical Methodist minister named Luther Lee, a passionate and vocal advocate of women&#x27;s right to theological education and leadership. At her ordination, Lee delivered a sermon testifying to Antoinette&#x27;s suitability as a preacher and her calling from God: &quot;If God and mental and moral culture have not already qualified her,&quot; he said to the crowd assembled for the occasion, &quot;we cannot, by anything we may do by way of ordaining or setting her apart ... All we are here to do ... is ... to subscribe our testimony to the fact, that in our belief, our sister in Christ, Antoinette L. Brown, is one of the ministers of the New Covenant, authorized, qualified, and called by God to preach the gospel of his Son Jesus Christ.&quot; A month after her ordination Brown traveled as a delegate to the World&#x27;s Temperance Convention in New York City, where despite representing two temperance organizations, she was denied a chance to speak by the organizers. In the words of Carol Lasser and Marlene Deahl Merrill, Brown again &quot;faced the difficulties of combining essentially conservative causes with women&#x27;s right&#x27;s work&quot; at the Temperance Conference At a crossroads in her life, in 1854, Blackwell wrote, &quot;I [find] that the whole groundwork of my faith has dropped away from me.&quot; This tension manifested itself within her, and after a year she decided to leave South Butler; and unfortunately, even Luther Lee&#x27;s unqualified support of Antoinette was not enough to provide her with a sustainable lifestyle there. The Boston Investigator reported her departure with the headline: &quot;REV. ANTOINETTE BROWN, more recently Rev. Mrs. Blackwell, seems to have made a failure in her first pastorate.&quot; She did not fail the pastorate due to her gender, but rather a growing insecurity of belief in the orthodoxy of the Congregational ministry, compounded with a lack of sustainable resources for her work. In 1857, she returned to her work as an orator and reformer.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
Following her separation from the ministry, she focused increasingly on women&#x27;s rights issues. While many women&#x27;s rights activists opposed religion on the basis that it served to oppress women, Blackwell was steadfast in her belief that women&#x27;s active participation in religion could serve to further their status in society. Unlike many of her peers, she cared more about improving women&#x27;s status in society than for suffrage. She believed that the inherent differences between men and women limited men&#x27;s effectiveness in representing women in politics; thus suffrage would have little positive impact for women unless it was coupled with tangible leadership opportunities. Brown also diverged in opinion from other reformers with her opposition to divorce as a means of easing women&#x27;s marital restrictions.

Antoinette left for New York City to do charity work in the slums and to lecture and raise money for the people who lived there. On her way to New York City, she stopped in Worcester, Massachusetts to attend the first National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention. This convention influenced her so much that she decided to become an independent speaker. She traveled throughout New England in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio to speak on Woman&#x27;s Rights, Anti-Slavery and Temperance. She sometimes even spoke in church sermons when she had the chance.

With regard to her own prospect of marriage, Brown believed that it was best to remain single because single women experienced greater levels of independence than married women. Upon meeting Samuel Blackwell, her opinions began to waver in favor of marriage. The two married on January 24, 1856, and they had seven children, two dying in infancy.

Blackwell continued her career until domestic responsibilities and her disagreement with many aspects of the women&#x27;s rights movement caused her to discontinue lecturing. Writing became her new outlet for asserting social change for women; in her works she encouraged women to seek out masculine professions and men to share in household duties, yet she retained the belief that women&#x27;s primary role was care of the home and family. Inspired by yet critical of the writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, who she considered to be the most influential men of her day, Blackwell published several works in the fields of theology, science and philosophy. She believed both Darwin and Spencer employed a tainted version of the scientific method, one that embraced a solely masculine vantage point. Blackwell instead asserted that in order to understand women in society, women themselves ought to conduct the study of women, which Blackwell termed the &quot;science of Feminine Humanity.&quot; Perhaps her most notable work was published in 1875, &quot;The Sexes Throughout Nature&quot;, in which she presented a quasi-scientific theory arguing that the sexes are different but equal by way of natural evolution. She knew she would be considered presumptuous for criticizing evolutionary theory, but wrote that &quot;However great the disadvantages under which we [women] are placed, these will never be lessened by waiting.&quot; Darwin had written a letter to her in 1869, thanking her for a copy of her book, &quot;Studies in General Science&quot;. She also wrote a novel, &quot;The Island Neighbors&quot;, in 1871, and a collection of poetry, &quot;Sea Drift&quot;, in 1902.

In 1860, at the last National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention held before the outbreak of the Civil War, Antoinette engaged in the heated debate about divorce with her colleagues and contemporaries, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She was opposed to an easy divorce arguing, &quot;the married partner can not annul his obligations to the other… All divorce is naturally and morally impossible.&quot; Antoinette, a staunch abolitionist and suffragist, contrary to the hopes of her friends and fellow suffragists, supported the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which did not include the right of free women to vote. In 1869, during the controversy over the amendment, she and Lucy Stone separated from other preeminent women&#x27;s rights activists to form the American Woman Suffrage Association as a counterweight to Anthony&#x27;s National Woman Suffrage Association.

In 1873, Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women in an attempt to address women&#x27;s issues that similar organizations ignored. She was elected president of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association in 1891 and helped found the American Purity Association. She also lectured on behalf of the poor of New York City.

==Later life==

Oberlin College awarded Brown an honorary Master&#x27;s and Doctoral degrees in 1878 and 1908, respectively.

In 1878, she returned to organized religion, becoming a Unitarian. She applied to the American Unitarian Association and was recognized as a minister. She spoke in Unitarian churches and resumed her lecture touring.

In 1893, Brown attended the Parliament of Religions during the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. There, she said, &quot;Women are needed in the pulpit as imperatively and for the same reason that they are needed in the world—because they are women. Women have become—or when the ingrained habit of unconscious imitation has been superseded, they will become—indispensable to the religious evolution of the human race.&quot;

In 1903, she helped found the Unitarian Society of Elizabeth, New Jersey, serving as its minister.

In 1914, she celebrated her eighty-ninth birthday planting trees in her private forest in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. 

In 1920, at age 95, she was the only surviving participant of the 1850 Women&#x27;s Rights Convention that took place in Worcester, Massachusetts, to see the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which gave women the right to vote. She voted for Warren G. Harding in the 1920 presidential election.

==Death and legacy==
Antoinette Brown Blackwell died November 5, 1921, at the age of 96 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Her childhood home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

In 1975, the United Church of Christ at its 10th General Synod began awarding the Antoinette Brown Awards to ordained UCC women who &quot;exemplify the contributions that women can make through ordained ministry, have provided outstanding ministry in a parish or other church-related institutions, including women in specialized ministry, and have a sensitivity concerning the challenges and possibilities of women in ministry and advocacy on behalf of all women in the church.&quot;

In 1993, Antoinette Brown Blackwell was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1059454" wikidata="Q2282662" url="?curid=1059454" title="Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)">
<text>Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) is the first compilation album by the American rock band the Eagles, released by Asylum Records on February 17, 1976. It contains a selection of songs from the band&#x27;s first four albums, which were released from 1972 to 1975. On the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the album reached number one, where it stayed for five weeks.

The album has the distinction of being the first album to receive a Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) platinum certification, which was introduced in 1976 to recognize albums that ship at least one million copies in the United States. It was ranked number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end album chart for 1976, and has spent a total of 455 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (as of September 21, 2024). The RIAA has certified the album 38 times platinum, indicating sales of 38 million copies in America alone, which would make &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; the best-selling album of the 20th century in the United States (it was surpassed in platinum certifications by Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; after Jackson&#x27;s death in 2009, but regained the title in August 2018). In 2017, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; comprises nine singles released between 1972 and 1975, plus the album track &quot;Desperado&quot;. All of the singles except &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; had charted in the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and five had reached the top ten. &quot;One of These Nights&quot; and &quot;Best of My Love&quot; had both topped the chart.

Irving Azoff, the manager of the Eagles, said: &quot;We decided it was time to put out the first greatest-hits because we had enough hits.&quot; According to Don Felder, however, none of the band members had any say in the decision to release the compilation album, which they complained was &quot;nothing more than a ploy by the record company to sell product without having to pay additional production costs&quot;. Don Henley was unhappy that songs like &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot; were lifted out of the context of the original album in a way that he thought was detrimental to the nature, quality, and meaning of the music. He said: &quot;All the record company was worried about were their quarterly reports. They didn&#x27;t give a shit whether the greatest hits album was good or not, they just wanted product.&quot; Despite being unhappy with the album&#x27;s release, the band nevertheless reasoned that it gave them more time to work on the &quot;Hotel California&quot; album, which was released later in 1976.

==Artwork==
The cover of the album is an image of a piece of art created by artist Boyd Elder (aka &quot;El Chingadero&quot;), whose work was also used for the cover of &quot;One of These Nights&quot;. The piece consists of a painted plastic cast of an eagle skull against a light-blue background made of silver mylar. The bumpy appearance of the background gave rise to a myth that it was covered in cocaine powder that the band snorted after the photo shoot. The band chose not to debunk that myth, though Glenn Frey reportedly also noticed the resemblance and told Elder that the background reminded him of &quot;a field of blow&quot; (a slang term for cocaine). The artist was paid $5,000 for his work on the cover.

As with &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, the original vinyl editions of &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; featured messages printed onto the inner dead wax. In this case, &quot;Happy New Year, Glyn&quot; and &quot;With Love from Bill&quot; appear on sides one and two, respectively.

==Critical reception==

William Ruhlmann of AllMusic said the songs in the compilation are melodic, immediately engaging, and lyrically consistent, so, &quot;unlike the albums from which they come, these songs make up a collection consistent in mood and identity, which may help explain why &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; works so much better than the band&#x27;s previous discs and practically makes them redundant. No wonder it was such a big hit out of the box&quot;.

In a 1978 poll of 50 rock critics and DJs organized by Paul Gambaccini, the album was ranked number 141. It was voted by the public as the sixth best compilation album in the 1994 edition of &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; debuted at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and reached number one the following week, where it stayed for five weeks. It ranked number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end album chart for 1976, and has spent a total of 239 weeks on the Billboard 200 (as of August 2018). Of its 465 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Catalog Albums chart, the album has spent 15 non-consecutive weeks at number one.

The album has the distinction of being the first album to receive the RIAA&#x27;s platinum certification, which was introduced in 1976 to recognize albums that ship one million copies in the United States. It received its first platinum certification a week after its release (on February 24, 1976), was certified 12 times platinum in August 1990, 14 times platinum in 1993, and 22 times platinum in 1995. On November 10, 1999, the album became the best-selling album of the 20th century in the United States when it was certified 26 times platinum. In a 2001 radio interview, Randy Meisner said neither he nor Bernie Leadon were notified of the 1999 certification, &quot;so we had to call and we finally received it.&quot; The album was certified 29 times platinum on January 30, 2006, and, in August 2018, it was certified 38 times platinum under a new system that tallies album and track sales as well as streams, surpassing Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (certified 34 times platinum) to again become the highest-certified album by the RIAA.

There is skepticism of the album&#x27;s RIAA certifications. The additional certifications it received in 1995 indicate it had sold eight million units since 1993, but, per Nielsen SoundScan, it sold fewer than a million copies during that period, as well as just over five (rather than 17) million copies from 1991 (when SoundScan began tracking) to 2006, and 6.4 million album-equivalent units from 1991 to February 2020 (again, far fewer than the certifications credit). In 2018, Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer stated the album only sold 2.3 million units from 2006 to 2018, yet it received certifications for nine million additional units. Warner Music, which distributed &quot;Their Greatest Hits&quot;, claimed the figure came from newly discovered sales dating back to 1976, but a representative from Michael Jackson&#x27;s estate noted sales audits are usually restricted to three years and said, &quot;The notion that they can go back 10, 15, 20 or 30 years and find units that were never counted before is absurd, they reviewed these records before. Why didn&#x27;t they find those uncounted records then?&quot;

Worldwide, the album has sold over 45 million copies as of 2020, making it the best-selling greatest hits album, and the third best-selling album, of all time.

<text>The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) is an agency of the European Union (EU) dealing with judicial co-operation in criminal matters among agencies of the member states. It is seated in The Hague, Netherlands. Established in 2002, it was created to improve handling of serious cross-border and organised crime by stimulating investigative and prosecutorial co-ordination.

Eurojust is composed of a college formed of 27 national members—experienced judges, prosecutors, or police officers of equivalent competence from each EU member state. The terms and duties of the members are defined by the state that appoints them. Eurojust also co-operates with third states and other EU bodies such as the European Judicial Network, Europol and the OLAF.

==History==
Eurojust was established as a result of a decision that the European Council of Tampere (15-16 October 1999) made to set up a permanent judicial co-operation unit in order to improve the fight against serious crime. The Treaty of Nice amended the Treaty on the European Union to include a reference to Eurojust. On 14 December 2000, a precursor organization called Pro-Eurojust was created by the Council of the European Union to permit prosecutors to test the Eurojust processes. It began operating in Brussels on 1 March 2001. The terrorist attacks in the U.S. in September of that year demonstrated strongly the need for international cooperation, speeding the development of Eurojust, which was then established in February 2002 by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA. The new organization settled in The Hague on 29 April 2003.

Since its establishment, Eurojust has focused heavily on forging international co-operation agreements and building international contact points, including the basing at Eurojust of several liaison prosecutors (Norway, Switzerland, Montenegro and the United States). In addition to these four nations, it has co-operation agreements with Europol, OLAF, CEPOL, the European Judicial Training Network, UNODC, IberRed, Croatia (before it entered the European Union on 1 July 2013, thus joining EUROJUST), Iceland, and North Macedonia.

The New Council Decision on the Strengthening of Eurojust was signed in July 2008 to enhance Eurojust&#x27;s cooperation with partners and third States and to generally strengthen its operational capabilities.

Council Decision 2002/187/JHA was completely replaced with Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 which entered into force on the twentieth day following the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union on the 21.11.2018.

==Functions==

===Types of crimes and offences===
According to the Eurojust Decision, Eurojust may act when two or more Member states are affected crimes in which Europol is entitled to act, including organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime (unlawful drug trafficking, illegal moneylaundering activities, crime connected with nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, motor vehicle crime, murder, grievous bodily injury, illicit trade in human organs and tissue, kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage taking, racism and xenophobia, organised robbery, illicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiquities and works of art, swindling and fraud, racketeering and extortion, counterfeiting and product piracy, forgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein, forgery of money and means of payment, computer crime, corruption, illicit trafficking in arms, ammunition and explosives, illicit trafficking in endangered animal species, illicit trafficking in endangered plant species and varieties, environmental crime, illicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters). It may also act on other types of crime if they are committed together with one of the above or if it is requested by a member state. In 2010, about 10% of the cases handled by Eurojust fell into this category.

Eurojust&#x27;s primary focus are on crimes that represent a &quot;special threat&quot; to citizens, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, cybercrime, fraud, corruption, money laundering and other economic crime.

===Tasks===
Eurojust is not empowered to investigate or prosecute crimes, but instead works to coordinate investigations and prosecutions between the EU Member States when dealing with cross-border crime. They may also assist investigations and prosecutions between a requesting Member State and a non-Member State where a co-operation agreement exists or where there is special need.

Eurojust&#x27;s tasks may vary depending on whether it is acting a college or through national members. Among other tasks, Eurojust may:
*Ask competent authorities in Member States to investigate or prosecute specific acts, accept that one Member State may be the better jurisdiction for investigation or prosecution, co-ordinate with other Member States, set up a joint investigation team, or supply information to Eurojust;
*Ensure that Member States communicate with one another about relevant investigations and prosecutions;
*Assist Member States in ensuring co-ordination or improving co-operation;
*Co-operate and consult with the European Judicial Network.
*Assist Europol, particularly by providing opinions based on Europol analyses (as a College);
*Supply logistical support such as assistance for translation, interpretation and the organisation of co-ordination meetings (as a College).
*Ask authorities of Member States to take special investigative measures or other measures justified for investigation or prosecution (through national members);
*Assist investigations and prosecutions concerning the competent authorities of only one Member State, where the European Union itself or a non-Member State are involved (through national members with agreement of the College).

As Eurojust is tasked with facilitating the execution of letters rogatory and extradition requests, it also may act on European Arrest Warrants (EAW). When more than one EAW exists for one individual, Eurojust may advise the judicial authority that executes the EAW which should take priority and may also facilitate communication between the judicial authorities involved. It is also the body to which member states may report delays in execution of EAWs of the reason for such delay. In 2010, a total of 280 cases concerning the execution of EAWs were registered at Eurojust, amounting to almost 20 per cent of all cases.

Eurojust may also take part in a joint investigation team (JIT) or, on request of a member state, help establish one and/or assist in managing one administratively or by securing funding. Such teams are created on the agreement of two or more involved parties for a specific purpose and limited time to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the member states involved. JITs were established on the belief that cross-state teams of investigators and judicial authorities with clear legal authority and defined roles would improve the fight against organised crime.

===Caseload===
Eurojust has handled an increasingly heavy caseload since its creation. In 2002, it was contacted in 202 cases. In 2016, member states sought assistance with 2,306 new cases. The majority cases involve two member states; in 2010, one-fifth of the cases involved three or more countries. Eurojust also organised 249 co-ordination meetings between representatives of national authorities and EU bodies in 2016.

==Administration==

The College of Eurojust is supported by the administration. As head of the Eurojust administration, the Administrative Director is responsible for the day-to-day management of Eurojust, including budget and staff management. The administrative organisation is composed of units, services and secretariats: the Accounting Office, Budget, Finance and Procurement Unit, College Secretariat, Corporate Communications Office, Data Protection Service, Events and Logistics Office, Human Resources Unit, Information Management Unit, Institutional Affairs Office, Legal Affairs Office, Operations Unit, Planning, Programming &amp; Reporting Office and Security, Facility &amp; General Services.

==International cooperation ==

Eurojust maintains cooperation agreements with 14 non-EU member states. The latest, Armenia, signed a cooperation agreement with Eurojust on 5 April 2024.

==Future developments==
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) addresses several changes to Eurojust. Article 85 extends its scope to including serious crime not only affecting two or more member states, but also requiring prosecution on a common basis. The new wording of the Treaty mentions that by means of regulations adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Parliament and the Council shall determine Eurojust&#x27;s structure, operation, field of action and tasks, which may include initiating criminal investigations or proposing the initiation of prosecutions, coordinating such investigations and prosecutions and strengthening judicial co-operation. Article 86 provides for the possibility of establishing a European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) from Eurojust in order to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union. The EPPO may be established by the Council, according to a special legislative procedure, acting unanimously and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. The Treaty provides also for the possibility to create it by enhanced co-operation established by at least nine Member States.

The Stockholm Programme refers several times to the role of Eurojust. In particular, it states that “in the field of judicial co-operation, the European Council emphasises the need for Member States and Eurojust to implement thoroughly Council Decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 on the strengthening of Eurojust, which, together with the Lisbon Treaty, offers an opportunity for the further development of Eurojust in the coming years, including in relation to initiation of investigations and resolving conflicts of competence. On the basis of an assessment of the implementation of this instrument, new possibilities could be considered in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty, including giving further powers to the Eurojust national members, reinforcement of the powers of the College of Eurojust or the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor”.

<doc id="1059463" wikidata="Q69450" url="?curid=1059463" title="Henry III of Nassau-Breda">
<text>Count Henry III of Nassau-Dillenburg-Dietz (12 January 1483 – 14 September 1538), Lord (from 1530 Baron) of Breda, Lord of the Lek, of Dietz, etc. was a count of the House of Nassau.

He was born in Siegen, the son of Count John V of Nassau-Dillenburg and Elisabeth of Hesse-Marburg. His younger brother was William I, Count of Nassau-Siegen (the father of William the Silent).

==Career==
In 1499 Henry&#x27;s uncle, count Engelbert II, invited Henry to the Burgundian Netherlands as his heir. He travelled with Philip the Handsome to Castile in 1501-1503. Upon the death of his uncle in 1504 Henry inherited the Nassau possessions in the Netherlands, including the wealthy lordship of Breda in the duchy of Brabant. The next year he was chosen a knight of the Golden Fleece. He again travelled to Spain in 1505-1506. He became a close confidant of the young Charles V as well as his Chamberlain (1510), becoming his Upper Chamberlain upon the death of William of Croÿ-Chièvres in 1521. The good relations between Charles and Henry is evident in the fact that Charles did not name a new Upper Chamberlain after Henry&#x27;s death. Henry was named Grand Huntsman of Brabant, a position at court he held until the end of his life.

In 1519 he was part of the delegation that had Charles chosen king of the Romans. He was also prominently present at Charles&#x27; coronation to Emperor in Bologna in 1530. He was a member of the Privy Council of Charles since 1515 and of the Privy Council of Archduchess Margaret of Austria between 1525-1526. He temporarily served as Stadtholder of the conquered parts of Guelders and was Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland between 1515 and 1521. Henry was again in Spain between 1522 and 1530 (accompanying Charles) and in 1533-1534 (with his wife and son).

==Military commander==
Henry served as an important military commander in the Netherlands, defending Brabant from Guelders in 1508. He was Captain General in the war with Guelders between 1511 and 1513, and fought with Maximilian of Austria against France until 1514, participating in the battle of Guinegate (1513). He again commanded the armies against Guelders and France between 1516 and 1521, defeating the Black Band, which was in the employ of Charles of Guelders, in 1518 and defeating Robert van der Marck, Lord of Sedan in 1521. He also repelled Francis I of France, who invaded Hainaut that same year. Subsequently, Henry conquered Tournai. 
==Beliefs==
Although Henry, who attended the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, was at first not averse to Martin Luther and his teachings, he later followed Charles&#x27; example and remained a staunch Catholic. He did not approve of the choice of his brother William, who did become a Lutheran, but remained supportive of him throughout his life. He was very impressed with the Renaissance and especially its arts, examples of which he encountered on his journeys to Spain and Italy. For example, he commissioned Italian architect Tomasso Vincidor da Bologna to completely rebuild his castle at Breda in a renaissance style in 1536, one of the first of such buildings north of the Alps. However, his interests seem to have been superficial. Desiderius Erasmus only considered him a &quot;platonic friend of science&quot;.

==Family life and death==

Henry married three times:
*On 3 August 1503 Henry III married firstly Françoise Louise of Savoy (° bef. 1486 - † 17 September 1511). They had no children.
*In May 1515 Henry III married secondly Claudia of Châlon (° 1498 – † 31 May 1521). They had one son, René of Châlon (° 5 February 1519 - † 18 July 1544), who became prince of Orange in 1530 on the death of Claudia&#x27;s brother Philibert.
*On 26 June 1524 Henry III married thirdly Mencia de Mendoza y Fonseca (° 30 November 1508 – † 4 January 1554). They had one son, born in March 1527, who lived only a few hours.

Henry had no further legitimate children, although he is known to have had some illegitimate offspring, amongst them Alexis of Nassau-Corroy and Isabelle of Nassau, both legitimised after the death of their father, and both had an impressive descendance. One of his descendants is Philippe François de Berghes, 1st Prince of Grimberghen.

His third marriage to Mencia de Mendoza y Fonseca was mainly encouraged by Charles V, as part of his plan to make the nobility of Spain and the Low Countries mix. Henry was however never really liked by the Spaniards, who regarded him as a loud and barbarian German parvenu. Upon his death, in Breda, in 1538 he was succeeded by his only son, but René was himself slain in battle only a few years later in 1544. Henry lies buried beneath the grave monument he had erected for his uncle Engelbert in the at Breda.

<text>Sir Harry Talbot Gibbs (7 February 191725 June 2005) was Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1981 to 1987 after serving as a member of the High Court between 1970 and 1981. He was known as one of Australia&#x27;s leading federalist judges although he presided over the High Court when decisions such as &quot;Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Commonwealth v Tasmania&quot; expanded the powers of the Commonwealth at the expense of the states. Gibbs dissented from the majority verdict in both cases. On 3 August 2012, the Supreme Court of Queensland Library opened the Sir Harry Gibbs Legal Heritage Centre. It is the only legal heritage museum of its kind in Queensland and features a permanent exhibition dedicated to the life and legacy of Sir Harry Gibbs.

==Early career (1917–1970)==
Harry Talbot Gibbs was educated at the Ipswich Grammar School and later at Emmanuel College at the University of Queensland, where he was President of the University of Queensland Union. He graduated from the latter with a Bachelor of Arts with honours in 1937 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1939. The same year he was admitted to the bar, but his legal career was interrupted by World War II and he served in the Australian Military Forces from 1942 to 1945 and in the Second Australian Imperial Force in Papua New Guinea, attaining the rank of Captain. He married Muriel Dunn in 1944 and the couple had three daughters and a son (Barbara, Mary, Margaret and Harry). His younger brother Wylie Gibbs was a federal Liberal MP in the 1960s.

While stationed in Papua New Guinea, Gibbs developed an interest in its legal system and was awarded a Master of Laws based on his research. He returned to the practice of law following the war and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1957, while also lecturing in law at the University of Queensland.

Gibbs served as a judge on the Supreme Court of Queensland from 8 June 1961 until 24 June 1967. He was the first law graduate of the University of Queensland to join that Court. In 1963, Gibbs was appointed Chair of the Supreme Court of Queensland Library Committee and held the position until 1967.

In 1967 Gibbs was appointed to the Federal Court of Bankruptcy and the ACT Supreme Court. He was appointed as a judge at a relatively early age of 44 due to his reputation at the bar. During his service, he was appointed as a Royal Commissioner in the National Hotel Royal Commission following allegations that the hotel was the centre of a network of vice including a call girl ring with support of senior members of the Queensland Police Force. Gibbs found that the allegations were not correct. Critics such as Evan Whitton and Richard Ackland claim that Gibbs inappropriately followed the hearsay rules, excluding a great deal of evidence despite the fact that Royal Commissioners are not bound to follow such rules. He also chaired a committee of inquiry into the expansion of the Australian sugar industry.

==High Court Justice (1970–1981)==
In 1970, Gibbs joined the High Court of Australia replacing Sir Frank Kitto. During his early years on the Court, there was high turnover of judges, with Sir Victor Windeyer retiring in 1972, Sir William Owen dying in 1972, Sir Cyril Walsh dying in 1973 and Sir Douglas Menzies dying in 1974. As a result of this high turnover, Gibbs rapidly became second in seniority behind Sir Garfield Barwick.

Gibbs&#x27; first significant case was &quot;Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd&quot; in 1971, a landmark trade practices case which significantly expanded the powers of the Commonwealth under section 51(xx) of the Constitution, the corporations power. He was in the minority.

In the &quot;Curran&quot; case decided in 1974, Gibbs was part of the majority ruling in favour of the legality of a tax minimisation scheme. As a result of the proliferation of similar schemes, John Howard as Treasurer introduced retrospective legislation which was subsequently passed by the parliament.

The &quot;AAP Case&quot; in 1975, examined the nature of the appropriations power in section 81 of the Constitution and the incidental power in section 51(xxxix) of the Constitution. The &quot;Appropriation Act (Number 1)&quot; provided for certain sums to be appropriated to the Australian Assistance Plan to enable grants to be made to Regional Councils for Social Development. The Victorian Government disputed the powers of the Commonwealth to legislate for such purposes. In his dissenting judgement, Justice Gibbs held that the words of Section 61 &quot;make it clear that the Executive cannot act in respect of a matter which falls entirely outside the legislative competence of the Commonwealth&quot;.

Gibbs was part of a 6:1 majority in the &quot;DOGS Case&quot; in 1981, which found that the Commonwealth could provide financial assistance to non-Government schools.

==Chief Justice of the High Court (1981–1987)==

In 1981, Gibbs was appointed Chief Justice after the retirement of Sir Garfield Barwick. The first notable case to come before his court was &quot;Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen&quot;, decided in 1982. This case upheld the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; with a majority of the Court finding that the external affairs power allowed the Commonwealth to pass such legislation as a consequence of Australia&#x27;s obligations under the &quot;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&quot;. Gibbs dissented, finding that the Commonwealth might have such powers only in relationships with other nations and only if the treaty arranged with other nations was &quot;international in character&quot;.

The external affairs power was expanded further in the case of &quot;Commonwealth v Tasmania&quot; in 1983 known as the Tasmanian Dams case. The High Court upheld the &quot;World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983&quot; passed by the Commonwealth Parliament to stop the Government of Tasmania from building a dam on the Franklin River which had been nominated for World Heritage Site status. The majority of the court found that the external affairs power enabled the Commonwealth Parliament to pass such legislation under the &quot;Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage&quot;. Gibbs again dissented, finding that the use of the external affairs power should be limited by the status of Australia as a federation and if the Commonwealth was granted too much power under section 51 of the Australian Constitution, it would upset the &quot;Federal balance&quot;.

The latter part of Gibbs&#x27; tenure as Chief Justice was dominated by allegations of impropriety against Lionel Murphy, a fellow justice of the High Court. &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper published transcriptions of conversations between Murphy and NSW solicitor Morgan Ryan, alleging an improper relationship between the two men in February 1984. Two Senate Committees were established to look into the matter along with the Stewart Royal Commission in NSW to look into the tapes. A lengthy court case ensued resulting in Murphy&#x27;s acquittal.

When the Stewart Royal Commission published a secret volume of conversations between Murphy and Ryan, Gibbs insisted on reading the Royal Commission Report and advised Lionel Bowen, the Commonwealth Attorney-General, that some justices intended making public their reluctance to sit with Murphy in 1986.

Lionel Bowen set up a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry consisting of three retired judges in 1986 to inquire into the claims. However, this commission was soon abandoned as Murphy advised that he had inoperable cancer. Against Gibbs&#x27; strong advice, Murphy sat for a week as a Justice before his death in 1986.

Gibbs left the High Court of Australia upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. He was widely regarded as a healer after Sir Garfield Barwick&#x27;s controversial stint as Chief Justice. He also had an international reputation, with Lord Denning stating &quot;I would rank him as one of the greatest of your chief justices, rivalling even Sir Owen Dixon.&quot;

==Retirement (1987–2005)==

After his retirement from the High Court, Gibbs continued to serve in several important roles. In 1987 he was &#x27;Judge-in-Residence&#x27; at the University of Queensland. He was the Chairman of the Parliamentary Judges Commission in 1989 resulting from the removal of Justice Angelo Vasta from the Queensland Supreme Court. He was Vice-President of the Kiribati Court of Appeal between 1988 and 1999 and the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law between 1987 and 1991. As well, he chaired the Inquiry into Community Needs and High Voltage Transmission Development Commission.

In the early 1990s Gibbs was intimately involved with the foundation of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (ACM), an organisation whose aim is to defend Australia&#x27;s constitutional monarchy. As a founder of the movement he was both a signatory of the ACM charter and a member of its Foundation Council. His beliefs about the role of The Crown in Australian society saw him campaign for the NO case in the 1999 constitutional referendum.

Gibbs&#x27; activism in this area was not limited to the ACM. In 1992 he accepted the role of President of the Samuel Griffith Society. Here he set the tone of the society when he presented a paper entitled &quot;Re-Writing the Constitution&quot;.

Gibbs&#x27; death was announced only after his cremation had taken place, in Sydney on 28 June 2005. At his funeral the eulogy was delivered by his former Associate, David Jackson QC. He had, before his death, forbidden the convening of a state funeral in his honour.

==Honours==
Harry Gibbs was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 22 September 1970.

In 1972, he was made a Privy Counsellor and sat on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council thirteen times.

On 3 April 1981, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1987, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

<doc id="1059474" wikidata="Q2598092" url="?curid=1059474" title="Shorne">
<text>Shorne is a village and civil parish in the borough of Gravesham in Kent, England. The parish lies east of Gravesend. Most of the land is well-drained but its marshes, the Shorne Marshes reach down to the Thames Estuary and are an SSSI amid the North Kent Marshes on the Hoo Peninsula proper.

==History==
Shorne Barrow (or tumulus) and Randalls Wood Barrow are indications of Stone Age occupation.

Randall Manor was a 14th-century manor, the remains of which are in Shorne Woods Country Park.

==Demographics==
According to the census results for 2001 there were 2,485 people in 1,028 households in the Parish of Shorne. Of those residents between the ages of 16 and 74, 60% had a higher qualification (at level 2 to 5) and 86% of the dwellings were owner occupied.
The population of Shorne Parish at the 2011 census was 2487 residents in 1033 households.[2]

==Transport==
In April 2017, it was announced that the government choice for the Lower Thames Crossing was for a tunnel under the Thames between East Tilbury and Shorne.

==Places of interest==
Much of upper Shorne is a conservation area with thirteen listed buildings and many others of interest. These include:

Pipes Place is in Forge Lane almost opposite Little St, Katherines. A local magistrate, Richard Parker lived on the site in 1642. Jarvis Maplesden the grandson of a local tanner purchased the house early in the 18th century along with twenty acres of land, which included St. Katharine&#x27;s Chapel. Several generations of the Maplesden family lived in the house and there are gravestones bearing the Maplesden name still in the churchyard. The Maplesden family is responsible for its present build and design in the Georgian style. In about 1870, George Arnold, Mayor of Gravesend, bought and restored the ruined chapel.

<text>Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp) was an agency of the State of New South Wales, Australia established under the &quot;Transport Administration Act 1988&quot; in 2004. It was a division under the control of Transport for NSW since the latter&#x27;s establishment in 2011. RailCorp was converted into a state-owned corporation and renamed the Transport Asset Holding Entity (TAHE) on 1 July 2020.

Until its conversion to TAHE, RailCorp held rail property assets, rolling stock and rail infrastructure in the Sydney metropolitan area and limited country locations in the state and it makes these assets available to Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink for their operations. It also managed the NSW Government&#x27;s contract with the Airport Link Company. At the time of conversion to TAHE, the acting chief executive of RailCorp was Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins.

Additionally, until 2013, RailCorp also formerly operated passenger train services in New South Wales under the brand CityRail, and maintained rail infrastructure within the New South Wales Metropolitan Rail Area. From July 2013, operation and maintenance functions were transferred to the newly created Sydney Trains and NSW Trains agencies, which were also subsidiaries of RailCorp, leaving RailCorp as the legal owner of a portfolio of $28.6 billion of railway property, mostly within the metropolitan area. In July 2017, Sydney Trains and NSW Trains ceased to be subsidiaries of RailCorp and became standalone independent agencies.

==History==
In January 2004, after much criticism and public perceptions of blame shifting between units of the State Rail Authority for operational failings, RailCorp was formed taking over the passenger train operations of CityRail and CountryLink, and responsibility for maintaining the greater metropolitan network from the Rail Infrastructure Corporation.

Initially governed by a Board of Directors as a State-owned corporation, changes to the resulted in RailCorp ceasing to be a state-owned corporation and becoming a NSW statutory authority on 1 January 2009. Further changes to the resulted in abolition of the Board effective 1 July 2010 and the repositioning of RailCorp as an agency of Transport NSW. This was followed by further structural changes under the Transport Legislation Amendment Act 2011, which saw Transport NSW replaced by Transport for NSW, which was established as a controlled entity of the Department of Transport, with Rail Corporation New South Wales a controlled entity of Transport for NSW. RailCorp reports to the Minister for Transport.

===Restructure===
In May 2012 the Minister for Transport announced a restructure of RailCorp from July 2013 that would:
* establish Sydney Trains to operate services in the Sydney Metropolitan area bounded by Berowra, Richmond, Emu Plains, Macarthur and Waterfall
* establish NSW TrainLink to operate all other passenger services including those of CountryLink 
* transfer capital projects and planning functions to Transport for NSW
* establish Transport Cleaning Services, a specialist division responsible for train cleaning
* establish a customer service division
* reduce RailCorp&#x27;s function to asset owner
* offer voluntary redundancies to 750 management and support staff

The restructure resulted in Sydney Trains and NSW Trains, which were subsidiaries of RailCorp, operating railway passenger services in New South Wales under the Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink brands. While being subsidiaries of Railcorp, Sydney Trains and NSW Trains were not controlled entities of RailCorp, but were instead controlled by Transport for NSW. Due to the restructure, CityRail and CountryLink were also abolished. In July 2017, Sydney Trains and NSW Trains ceased to be subsidiaries of RailCorp and became standalone and independent agencies of Transport for NSW.

===Transition into the Transport Asset Holding Entity=== 
RailCorp was converted into a state-owned corporation and renamed Transport Asset Holding Entity (TAHE) on 1 July 2020. The new entity would continue to own assets on behalf of Transport for NSW. The Residual Transport Corporation (RTC), which was formed in July 2017, would then own assets not suitable for TAHE ownership.

==Corruption investigation==
In 2007 and 2008, RailCorp was investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. In a series of seven reports released during 2008, the ICAC reported that more than $21 million in improper contracts and deals through the procurement of services in just three years. In June 2009, RailCorp terminated the contract of Vicki Coleman, its chief information officer, and it was claimed that she was at the centre of claims of dishonesty and corruption.

The ICAC recommended charges against 33 people; yet by April 2012, only eight people had faced the courts. Those that received custodial sentences included Allan Michael Blackstock (4½ years) and Renea Hughes (3½ years). Youssef (Joe) Madrajat was directed to undertake community service. Further charges are expected to be laid on others, and several are still waiting for the outcome of criminal proceedings.

==Emergency response==
RailCorp maintains a statewide Emergency Response Unit. The function of this unit is to attend incidents, such as derailments. Formerly known as the State Rail Fire Service, the unit is based in Sydney and respond to emergency incidents involving the rail network including automatic fire alarms within the underground and nearby stations. The unit also undertakes cross-training with Fire and Rescue NSW. The unit is currently equipped with a number of vehicles including Mercedes and International pumpers and a specialist rapid rail response unit which is able to travel via the road and rail network for rescue operations. The unit&#x27;s motto is &quot;Semper Paratus&quot;, translated from Latin to mean Always Ready.

<doc id="1059497" wikidata="Q3025374" url="?curid=1059497" title="Second Partition of Poland">
<text>The 1793 Second Partition of Poland was the second of three partitions (or partial annexations) that ended the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. The second partition occurred in the aftermath of the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Targowica Confederation of 1792, and was approved by its territorial beneficiaries, the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. The division was ratified by the coerced Polish parliament (Sejm) in 1793 (see the Grodno Sejm) in a short-lived attempt to prevent the inevitable complete annexation of Poland, the Third Partition.

==Background==
By 1790, on the political front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of the Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. The Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.

During the Polish–Russian War of 1792 in Defense of the Constitution, the Polish forces supporting the Constitution fought against the Imperial Russian Army, invited by the pro-Russian alliance of Polish magnates, known as the Targowica Confederation. The conservative nobility (see also, &quot;szlachta&quot;) believed that the Russians would help them restore their Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, the badly outnumbered Polish pro-Constitution forces fought under Prince Józef Poniatowski a defensive war with some measure of success, but were ordered to abandon their efforts by their supreme commander, King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The King decided to join the Targowica Confederation, as demanded by the Russians.

Russia invaded Poland to ensure the defeat of the Polish reforms, with no overt goal of another partition (it viewed Poland as its protectorate, and saw little need to give up chunks of Poland to other countries). Frederick William II of Prussia, however, saw those events as an opportunity to strengthen his country. Frederick demanded from Catherine that for his country&#x27;s abandoning Poland as a close ally, for Prussian participation in the War of the First Coalition against revolutionary France, because Russia had encouraged Prussian participation, and because Prussia had recently suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Valmy, Prussia should be compensated – preferably with parts of the Polish territory. Russia soon decided to accept the Prussian offer.

==Partition treaty==
On 23 January 1793, Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive broad swaths of Commonwealth territory. Russian and Prussian troops took control of the territories they claimed, with Russian troops already present, and Prussian troops meeting only limited resistance. In 1793, deputies to the Grodno Sejm, the last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of Russian forces, agreed to the Russian and Prussian territorial demands. The Grodno Sejm became infamous not only as the last sejm of the Commonwealth, but because its deputies had been bribed and coerced by the Russians (Russia and Prussia wanted legal sanction from Poland for their demands).

Imperial Russia annexed , while Prussia took . The Commonwealth lost about 307,000 km2, being reduced to 215,000 km2.

===Russian Partition===
Russia received the Kiev Voivodeship, Bracław Voivodeship, Podole Voivodeship and Minsk Voivodeship, and parts of the Vilnius Voivodeship, Nowogródek Voivodeship, Brest Litovsk Voivodeship and the Volhynian Voivodeship. This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 22 July. Russia reorganized its newly acquired territories into Minsk Viceroyalty and Izyaslav Viceroyalty (which in 1795 was split into Podolian and Volhynian Viceroyalties).

===Prussian Partition===
Prussia received the cities of Gdańsk (Danzig) and Toruń (Thorn), and Gniezno Voivodeship, Poznań Voivodeship, Sieradz Voivodeship, Kalisz Voivodeship, Płock Voivodeship, Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship, Inowrocław Voivodeship, Dobrzyń Land, and parts of the Kraków Voivodeship, Rawa Voivodeship and Masovian Voivodeship. This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 23 September or 25 September (sources vary). Prussia organized its newly acquired territories into South Prussia.

The Commonwealth lost about 5 million people; only about 4 million people remained in the Polish–Lithuanian lands.

What was left of the Commonwealth was a small buffer state with a puppet king, and Russian garrisons keeping an eye on the reduced army.

==Aftermath==
Targowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support. In March 1794 the Kościuszko Uprising began. The defeat of the Uprising in November that year resulted in the final Third Partition of Poland, ending the existence of the Commonwealth.

<doc id="1059498" wikidata="Q1757850" url="?curid=1059498" title="Eternal Rest">
<text>Eternal Rest or Requiem aeternam is a Western Christian prayer asking God:

(1) to hasten the progression of the souls of the faithful departed in Purgatory to their place in Heaven (in Catholicism)
(2) to rest in the love of God the souls of the faithful departed in Paradise until the resurrection of the dead and Last Judgement (in Catholicism, Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Methodism)

The prayer is cited from 2 Esdras (4 Esdras Vulgate):

Therefore, I say to you, O nations that hear and understand, “Wait for your shepherd; he will give you everlasting rest, because he who will come at the end of the age is close at hand. Be ready for the rewards of the kingdom, because perpetual light will shine on you forevermore.
-2 Esdras 2:34-35 NRSV

== Theology ==

This Catholic doctrine is found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraphs 1030-1032:

The Lutheran cleric Richard Futrell wrote that &quot;The historic practice within the Lutheran Church had prayers for the dead in their Prayer of the Church. For example, if we were to look at a typical Lutheran service during Luther’s lifetime, we would find in the Prayer of the Church not only intercessions, special prayers, and the Lord’s Prayer, which are still typical today in Lutheran worship, but also prayers for the dead.&quot; For those who have died, Martin Luther declared that &#x27;I regard it as no sin to pray with free devotion in this or some similar fashion: &quot;Dear God, if this soul is in a condition accessible to mercy, be thou gracious to it.&quot; (&quot;Luther’s Works&quot;, Volume 37)

The United Methodist Church teaches the &quot;truth of intercessory prayer for the dead&quot; and that &quot;prayer for the dead has been a widespread practice throughout Christian history [and] is a profound act of love addressed to a God of love&quot;.

==Text==
===Latin===
The Latin text in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church is:
===English===
The translation used by English-speaking Catholics is:

:℣. Eternal rest, grant unto him/her (them), O ,
:℟. And let perpetual light shine upon him/her (them).
:℣. May he/she (they) rest in peace.
:℟. Amen.

The translation used by English-speaking Lutherans is:

:℣. Rest eternal grant him/her, O ;
:℟. and let light perpetual shine upon him/her.
:℣. May he/she rest in peace.
:℟. Amen.

The translation used by English-speaking Anglicans is:

:℣. Rest eternal grant unto them, O :
:℟. and let light perpetual shine upon them.
:℣. May they rest in peace.
:℟. Amen.

A variation of the prayer said by American Methodist clergy during A Service of Death and Resurrection is:

Eternal God,
we praise you for the great company of all those
who have finished their course in faith
and now rest from their labor.
We praise you for those dear to us
whom we name in our hearts before you.
Especially we praise you for Name,
whom you have graciously received into your presence.
To all of these, grant your peace.
Let perpetual light shine upon them;
and help us so to believe where we have not seen,
that your presence may lead us through our years,
and bring us at last with them
into the joy of your home
not made with hands but eternal in the heavens;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

==Indulgence==
In the Catholic Church there was an indulgence of 300 days for each performance. The indulgence can also be made in favor of the souls in Purgatory.

<doc id="1059510" wikidata="Q5300122" url="?curid=1059510" title="Doubled die">
<text>Doubled die (also known as hub doubling) is a term in numismatics used to refer to a duplication of design elements on a working die created due to a misalignment of the die or hub during the hubbing process. Strength of the doubling can vary from very slight and isolated to extreme and widespread. The exact cause of the doubling can also vary, which is why a class system was created to outline the known and hypothesized causes.

Doubled die varieties, when noticeable to the naked eye or occur in a popular coin series, are extremely popular with collectors and can be worth a large premium over the same coin without the doubling. The most popular doubled die variety would be the 1955 US cent doubled die which typically sells for over $1000 at auction. 

This term is commonly misspelled &quot;double die.&quot;

==Classes of doubled dies==
Doubled dies are created when the hub imprints an additional, misaligned image onto a die. The many ways this misalignment of images can occur have been arranged into eight classes. This class system was created when United States mints used a multiple-squeeze hubbing method, meaning the working dies were intentionally hubbed multiple times to transfer a complete image. Many mints worldwide, including the United States, have since transitioned to a single-squeeze method, expecting the elimination of this hubbing error as only one hubbing is needed. However, the frequency of doubled dies actually increased with the new method. These new single-squeeze doubled dies have slightly different characteristics than ones from the previous method, leading to different opinions on whether the class system has to be revised or not. Some believe the single-squeeze doubled dies still fit in the existing system while others added a new ninth class for single-squeeze doubled dies.

;Class 1, Rotated
:A class I doubled die results when the die receives an additional hubbing that is misaligned in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
;Class 2, Distorted
:A class 2 doubled die results when the hub&#x27;s design moves toward the rim between hubbings.
;Class 3, Design
:A class 3 doubled die results when a hub bearing a different design stamps a die bearing another design.
;Class 4, Offset
:A class 4 doubled die results when the die receives an additional hubbing that is misaligned in an offset direction.
;Class 5, Pivoted
:A class 5 doubled die results when the die receives an additional hubbing that was misaligned via rotation with a pivot point near the rim.
;Class 6, Distended
:A class 6 doubled die results when the die receives an additional hubbing from a hub that was distended.
;Class 7, Modified
:A class 7 doubled die results when the hub is modified between the die&#x27;s hubbings (e.g., a design element was chiseled off).
;Class 8, Tilted
:A class 8 doubled die results when a die and/or hub is tilted during a hubbing.

==United States Coinage==

Doubled dies are a result of the way in which in the United States Mint&#x27;s dies are created. Before 1997, die pairs (hammer die and anvil die) were made by hubs that contained the raised design elements that were intended to appear on the coin. The blank dies were heated (to soften them) and then were pressed against the hubs to transfer the design from the hub to the working dies. One impression was not enough in every case to transfer the design elements from the hub to the die, so multiple impressions were required to transfer enough of the design. For this reason, after the first impression was made, the die was reheated and prepared for a second impression. The mint workers would use guides to align the hub and the working die perfectly to prevent overlapping, or a doubled die. It is when mint workers failed to align dies properly during this process that doubled dies were produced. In many instances three to four impressions were required, which could but rarely led to tripled and quadrupled dies.

Modern coining methods have vastly reduced the frequency of these varieties due to the use of a single squeeze hubbing method during die creation, but doubled dies in modern United States coinage are still occurring. With the new die making process, implemented after 1996, dies only required one impression of the hub to transfer all of the design from the hub to the die. But it has been discovered that the pressure created is so great, that some dies tend to slightly rotate during this process.

Modern doubled dies in American coinage are being discovered mainly in Lincoln cents. The 2004 Peace Reverse Nickel shows doubling in the date, motto, designer initials and eyelid of Thomas Jefferson. The 2005 Bison Reverse Nickel, shows slight doubling in the word &quot;Liberty&quot; and in other devices of the coin.

<text>Samuel Charles Blackwell (1823–1901) was a British-born American abolitionist.

==Biography==

Blackwell was born in England, the son of Bristol sugar refiner Samuel Blackwell (c. 1790–August 7, 1838) and Hannah Lane, who moved their family of eight children to the United States in 1832. They first lived in New York City, and later in New Jersey. Samuel Blackwell senior, an anti-slavery campaigner and Congregationalist who wanted his daughters educated as well as his sons, passed his interest in social reform on to his children. In 1838, the year he died, the family was living in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Samuel Charles Blackwell&#x27;s wife was Antoinette Brown, the first woman ordained in a recognized church in the United States, and prominent speaker in the Abolitionism and Women&#x27;s Rights Movements. Blackwell was also an abolitionist and was, like his wife, a Unitarian. He married Brown at her home in Henrietta, New York in 1856. At that time, Blackwell was in the hardware business and also invested in real estate. The couple next lived in New York City and then for many years in New Jersey. Blackwell helped care for their children (seven, of whom two died young), each of them given the &quot;double&quot; name Brown Blackwell.

At the time of his death in 1901, Samuel Charles Blackwell was 78 years old and had worked as the Treasurer of the Mexican and South American Telegraph Company for 20 years, where he took great interest in reform movements. 

His brother, Henry B. Blackwell, was the husband of Lucy Stone, a friend of Antoinette Brown at Oberlin College. (Stone was a noted abolitionist and worker for women&#x27;s suffrage.) His sisters included Elizabeth Blackwell, the first women to receive an MD in United States and the first to practice medicine, and Emily Blackwell, the third female graduate of a U.S. medical school, as well as writer/biographer Sarah Ellen Blackwell, and Anna Blackwell, who translated George Sand and Alan Kardec.

<doc id="1059530" wikidata="Q782746" url="?curid=1059530" title="Simple polygon">
<text>In geometry, a simple polygon is a polygon that does not intersect itself and has no holes. That is, it is a piecewise-linear Jordan curve consisting of finitely many line segments. These polygons include as special cases the convex polygons, star-shaped polygons, and monotone polygons.

The sum of external angles of a simple polygon is formula_1. Every simple polygon with formula_2 sides can be triangulated by formula_3 of its diagonals, and by the art gallery theorem its interior is visible from some formula_4 of its vertices.

Simple polygons are commonly seen as the input to computational geometry problems, including point in polygon testing, area computation, the convex hull of a simple polygon, triangulation, and Euclidean shortest paths.

Other constructions in geometry related to simple polygons include Schwarz–Christoffel mapping, used to find conformal maps involving simple polygons, polygonalization of point sets, constructive solid geometry formulas for polygons, and visibility graphs of polygons.

==Definitions==

A simple polygon is a closed curve in the Euclidean plane consisting of straight line segments, meeting end-to-end to form a polygonal chain. Two line segments meet at every endpoint, and there are no other points of intersection between the line segments. No proper subset of the line segments has the same properties. The qualifier &quot;simple&quot; is sometimes omitted, with the word &quot;polygon&quot; assumed to mean a simple polygon.

The line segments that form a polygon are called its &quot;edges&quot; or &quot;sides&quot;. An endpoint of a segment is called a &quot;vertex&quot; (plural: vertices) or a &quot;corner&quot;. &quot;Edges&quot; and &quot;vertices&quot; are more formal, but may be ambiguous in contexts that also involve the edges and vertices of a graph; the more colloquial terms &quot;sides&quot; and &quot;corners&quot; can be used to avoid this ambiguity. The number of edges always equals the number of vertices. Some sources allow two line segments to form a straight angle (180°), while others disallow this, instead requiring collinear segments of a closed polygonal chain to be merged into a single longer side. Two vertices are &quot;neighbors&quot; if they are the two endpoints of one of the sides of the polygon.

Simple polygons are sometimes called Jordan polygons, because they are Jordan curves; the Jordan curve theorem can be used to prove that such a polygon divides the plane into two regions. Indeed, Camille Jordan&#x27;s original proof of this theorem took the special case of simple polygons (stated without proof) as its starting point. The region inside the polygon (its &quot;interior&quot;) forms a bounded set topologically equivalent to an open disk by the Jordan–Schönflies theorem, with a finite but nonzero area. The polygon itself is topologically equivalent to a circle, and the region outside (the &quot;exterior&quot;) is an unbounded connected open set, with infinite area. Although the formal definition of a simple polygon is typically as a system of line segments, it is also possible (and common in informal usage) to define a simple polygon as a closed set in the plane, the union of these line segments with the interior of the polygon.

A &quot;diagonal&quot; of a simple polygon is any line segment that has two polygon vertices as its endpoints, and that otherwise is entirely interior to the polygon.

==Properties==
The &quot;internal angle&quot; of a simple polygon, at one of its vertices, is the angle spanned by the interior of the polygon at that vertex. A vertex is &quot;convex&quot; if its internal angle is less than formula_5 (a straight angle, 180°) and &quot;concave&quot; if the internal angle is greater than formula_5. If the internal angle is formula_7, the &quot;external angle&quot; at the same vertex is defined to be its supplement formula_8, the turning angle from one directed side to the next. The external angle is positive at a convex vertex or negative at a concave vertex. For every simple polygon, the sum of the external angles is formula_1 (one full turn, 360°). Thus the sum of the internal angles, for a simple polygon with formula_2 sides is formula_11.
Every simple polygon can be partitioned into non-overlapping triangles by a subset of its diagonals. When the polygon has formula_2 sides, this produces formula_13 triangles, separated by formula_3 diagonals. The resulting partition is called a &quot;polygon triangulation&quot;. The shape of a triangulated simple polygon can be uniquely determined by the internal angles of the polygon and by the cross-ratios of the quadrilaterals formed by pairs of triangles that share a diagonal.

According to the two ears theorem, every simple polygon that is not a triangle has at least two &quot;ears&quot;, vertices whose two neighbors are the endpoints of a diagonal. A related theorem states that every simple polygon that is not a convex polygon has a &quot;mouth&quot;, a vertex whose two neighbors are the endpoints of a line segment that is otherwise entirely exterior to the polygon. The polygons that have exactly two ears and one mouth are called &quot;anthropomorphic polygons&quot;.

According to the art gallery theorem, in a simple polygon with formula_2 vertices, it is always possible to find a subset of at most formula_4 of the vertices with the property that every point in the polygon is visible from one of the selected vertices. This means that, for each point formula_17 in the polygon, there exists a line segment connecting formula_17 to a selected vertex, passing only through interior points of the polygon. One way to prove this is to use graph coloring on a triangulation of the polygon: it is always possible to color the vertices with three colors, so that each side or diagonal in the triangulation has two endpoints of different colors. Each point of the polygon is visible to a vertex of each color, for instance one of the three vertices of the triangle containing that point in the chosen triangulation. One of the colors is used by at most formula_4 of the vertices, proving the theorem.

==Special cases==
Every convex polygon is a simple polygon. Another important class of simple polygons are the star-shaped polygons, the polygons that have a point (interior or on their boundary) from which every point is visible.

A monotone polygon, with respect to a straight line formula_20, is a polygon for which every line perpendicular to formula_20 intersects the interior of the polygon in a connected set. Equivalently, it is a polygon whose boundary can be partitioned into two monotone polygonal chains, subsequences of edges whose vertices, when projected perpendicularly onto formula_20, have the same order along formula_20 as they do in the chain.

== Computational problems==

In computational geometry, several important computational tasks involve inputs in the form of a simple polygon.
* Point in polygon testing involves determining, for a simple polygon formula_24 and a query point formula_25, whether formula_25 lies interior to formula_24. It can be solved in linear time; alternatively, it is possible to process a given polygon into a data structure, in linear time, so that subsequent point in polygon tests can be performed in logarithmic time.
* Simple formulae are known for computing the area of the interior of a polygon. These include the shoelace formula for arbitrary polygons, and Pick&#x27;s theorem for polygons with integer vertex coordinates.
* The convex hull of a simple polygon can also be found in linear time, faster than algorithms for finding convex hulls of points that have not been connected into a polygon.
* Constructing a triangulation of a simple polygon can also be performed in linear time, although the algorithm is complicated. A modification of the same algorithm can also be used to test whether a closed polygonal chain forms a simple polygon (that is, whether it avoids self-intersections) in linear time. This also leads to a linear time algorithm for solving the art gallery problem using at most formula_4 points, although not necessarily using the optimal number of points for a given polygon. Although it is possible to transform any two triangulations of the same polygon into each other by flips that replace one diagonal at a time, determining whether one can do so using only a limited number of flips is NP-complete.
* A geodesic path, the shortest path in the plane that connects two points interior to a polygon, without crossing to the exterior, may be found in linear time by an algorithm that uses triangulation as a subroutine. The same is true for the &quot;geodesic center&quot;, a point in the polygon that minimizes the maximum length of its geodesic paths to all other points.
* The visibility polygon of an interior point of a simple polygon, the points that are directly visible from the given point by line segments interior to the polygon, can be constructed in linear time. The same is true for the subset that is visible from at least one point of a given line segment.

Other computational problems studied for simple polygons include constructions of the longest diagonal or the longest line segment interior to a polygon, of the convex skull (the largest convex polygon within the given simple polygon), and of various one-dimensional &quot;skeletons&quot; approximating its shape, including the medial axis and straight skeleton. Researchers have also studied producing other polygons from simple polygons using their offset curves, unions and intersections, and Minkowski sums, but these operations do not always produce a simple polygon as their result. They can be defined in a way that always produces a two-dimensional region, but this requires careful definitions of the intersection and difference operations in order to avoid creating one-dimensional features or isolated points.

== Related constructions ==
According to the Riemann mapping theorem, any simply connected open subset of the plane can be conformally mapped onto a disk. Schwarz–Christoffel mapping provides a method to explicitly construct a map from a disk to any simple polygon using specified vertex angles and pre-images of the polygon vertices on the boundary of the disk. These &quot;pre-vertices&quot; are typically computed numerically.

Every finite set of points in the plane that does not lie on a single line can be connected to form the vertices of a simple polygon (allowing 180° angles); for instance, one such polygon is the solution to the traveling salesperson problem. Connecting points to form a polygon in this way is called polygonalization.

Every simple polygon can be represented by a formula in constructive solid geometry that constructs the polygon (as a closed set including the interior) from unions and intersections of half-planes, with each side of the polygon appearing once as a half-plane in the formula. Converting an formula_2-sided polygon into this representation can be performed in time formula_30.

The visibility graph of a simple polygon connects its vertices by edges representing the sides and diagonals of the polygon. It always contains a Hamiltonian cycle, formed by the polygon sides. The computational complexity of reconstructing a polygon that has a given graph as its visibility graph, with a specified Hamiltonian cycle as its cycle of sides, remains an open problem.

<text>Henry Browne Blackwell (May 4, 1825 – September 7, 1909), was an American advocate for social and economic reform. He was involved in the nascent Republican Party and the American Woman Suffrage Association. He published &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, starting in 1870 in Boston, Massachusetts, with Lucy Stone.

==Early life==
Henry Blackwell was born May 4, 1825, in Bristol, Gloucestershire, England, the seventh of nine children of Samuel Blackwell and Hannah Lane Blackwell. Blackwell&#x27;s father, a sugar refiner whose livelihood conflicted with his abolitionist principles, experimented with making beet sugar as an alternative to slave-grown cane sugar. In 1832, the family – including eight children and their father&#x27;s sister Mary – emigrated to the United States. The family settled first in New York, where Blackwell&#x27;s father established a sugar refinery and the ninth child was born, and then just outside New York in Jersey City. Blackwell&#x27;s father took an interest in the nascent abolition movement. William Lloyd Garrison and other leaders of the movement were visitors in the family&#x27;s home. Blackwell&#x27;s eldest sister, Anna, participated in the emerging agitation for women&#x27;s rights, attending the 1837 Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women and drafting its letter to John Quincy Adams thanking him for his support of women&#x27;s right to petition.

After fire destroyed the refinery and the Panic of 1837 destroyed remaining resources, the family moved to Cincinnati in 1838, where Blackwell&#x27;s father intended to establish another refinery. However, within months of their arrival, he died, leaving the family destitute. Blackwell&#x27;s mother, aunt, and three elder sisters opened a school in their home, while thirteen-year-old Henry and his brother Sam took clerking jobs. In 1840 Blackwell was sent to the short-lived Kemper College in St. Louis with the intent that he should become a lawyer. But financial difficulties forced him to return home and resume clerking. Around 1845, he became a partner in a flour mill business, in which he managed operations of three mills. Within a year he had made enough profit to purchase a small brick house in Cincinnati&#x27;s Walnut Hills section, which remained the Blackwell family home until they moved east in 1856.

Seeking a business in which he might achieve financial independence, Blackwell next tried sugar refining. When that failed, a visiting English cousin persuaded him to accept a loan with which he and brother Sam purchased half interest in a Cincinnati wholesale hardware business. In 1850, at the age of twenty-four, Blackwell became the traveling partner of Coombs, Ryland, and Blackwells, making semi-annual two-month-long horseback journeys through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, selling hardware to country merchants and collecting payments due the firm.

All the Blackwell siblings had been imbued with a philosophy of personal improvement and working for the betterment of mankind, as well as a deep interest in literature, languages, music, and art. Possessing a special passion for literature, Henry Blackwell wrote poetry in his spare time and always carried several books with him to make every spare moment &quot;useful&quot; and &quot;self-improving.&quot; He was a founding member of the Literary Club of Cincinnati, whose members discussed literature and debated issues of the day. He and fellow club member Ainsworth R. Spofford made business trips together, during which they relieved the tedium of slow travel by reading aloud to each other the works of Bacon, Shakespeare, Aristotle, and Plato. Through this club, whose early members included not only Spofford, who would become chief librarian of the Library of Congress, but also Rutherford B. Hayes and Salmon P. Chase, Blackwell formed lasting friendships with men who played prominent roles in the history of Ohio and the nation.

==Blackwell siblings==
Henry Blackwell&#x27;s eldest sister, Anna Blackwell (1816–1900), became a poet, translator, and journalist. She was a member of the Brook Farm community in 1845 but settled in France thereafter, where she translated the works of the French socialist Fourier and the novels of George Sand. She was also a contributing correspondent for several newspapers in the United States, India, Australia, South Africa, and Canada.

Marian Blackwell (1818–1897) taught school in her younger years but became a semi-invalid and lived with and looked after other family members.

The best-known of Blackwell&#x27;s siblings was Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910), the first woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. In 1853 she founded the New York Dispensary for Poor Women and Children, and in 1857, with sister Emily and Maria Zakrzewska, established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children.

Samuel Charles Blackwell (1823–1901), only a year and a half older than Henry, was bookkeeper and businessman, best known as the husband of Antoinette (Brown) Blackwell, the first woman ordained as a minister in the United States and prominent speaker and suffragist.

Henry had four younger siblings. Emily Blackwell (1826–1910), who was the third woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. In addition to co-founding the New York Infirmary, she helped organize the Women&#x27;s Central Association of Relief, which selected and trained nurses for service in the Civil War.

Sarah Ellen Blackwell (1828–1901) was an artist and author best known for writing the first full-length biography of Anna Ella Carroll.

(John) Howard Blackwell (1831–1866) returned to England and worked in iron manufacturing with a cousin, then joined the East India Company. His death at the age of 36 was a blow to the entire family.

George Washington Blackwell (1832–1912), the only Blackwell sibling born in the United States, became a land agent under Henry&#x27;s tutelage in the 1850s, studied law in New York City, and took over Henry Blackwell&#x27;s real estate business in the late 1860s.

==Courtship and marriage==
Blackwell was smitten by Lucy Stone when he heard her speak at an antislavery meeting in New York in May 1853, moving her audience to tears with what became known as her &quot;fugitive mother&quot; speech. He followed her to Massachusetts and obtained a formal letter of introduction from William Lloyd Garrison. Although Stone gladly accepted him as a friend, she rejected him as a suitor because she believed marriage would require her to surrender control over herself and prevent her from pursuing her chosen work. But Blackwell, not having been rejected personally, determined to convince Stone that marriage to him would require sacrifice of neither individuality nor career. He maintained that a marriage based on equality would enable each of them to accomplish more than they could alone. He, too, wanted to work for the good of humanity, but believed he must wait until he had attained the freedom to command his own time and action—&quot;pecuniary independence,&quot; which he expected to achieve in three years.
Through correspondence over the summer, Blackwell and Stone discussed the nature and faults of the marriage institution and the benefits of a true, ideal marriage. Then, eager to demonstrate how he could help Stone accomplish more, Blackwell offered to arrange a lecture tour for her in the west (then the mid-western states of Indiana, Illinois, and western Ohio and Kentucky). She accepted, and he wrote to business acquaintances to engage halls and place newspaper notice while personally printing and mailing broadsides for posting. From mid-October 1853 through the first week of January 1854, Stone lectured on women&#x27;s rights in more than ten cities in five states, including Cincinnati, Louisville, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Chicago. Newspaper reports described her enthusiastic reception by the largest audiences ever assembled in some of the cities, as well as the deep influence she was having on those who heard her. During an intimate rendezvous before she returned east, Stone expressed not only her deep gratitude to Blackwell for making her success possible, but also a genuine affection. Nevertheless, she remained resolute about never placing herself in the legal position occupied by a married woman.

As the long-distance courtship continued, Blackwell shifted his arguments to how couples could shape their own marriages, regardless of society&#x27;s laws. After nine additional months of correspondence and brief meetings, Blackwell met Stone in Pittsburgh for a clandestine three-day rendezvous, after which Stone agreed to marry him.

Through continued correspondence the couple set the terms of a private agreement aimed at protecting Stone&#x27;s financial independence and personal liberty. Blackwell proposed that their marriage be like a business partnership in monetary matters, with husband and wife being &quot;joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.&quot; Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other&#x27;s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other&#x27;s subsequent earnings. Each would have the right to will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Blackwell advised Stone to secure all her money in the hands of a trustee for her benefit. Stone agreed to everything except the issue of marital support. She refused to be supported by Blackwell and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. Despite Blackwell&#x27;s strenuous objection, Stone remained adamant.

In addition to financial independence, Blackwell and Stone agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: &quot;Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.&quot; And Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose &quot;when, where and how often&quot; she would &quot;become a mother.&quot; This was Blackwell&#x27;s way of agreeing that Stone would control their sexual relations as advocated by Henry C. Wright, a copy of whose book &quot;Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness&quot;, Stone had earlier given to Blackwell and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be.

Blackwell also proposed that as part of their marriage ceremony, he would &quot;renounce all the privileges which the law confers upon me which are not strictly mutual&quot; and &quot;pledge myself to never avail myself of them under any circumstances.&quot; The wedding took place at Stone&#x27;s home in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, on May 1, 1855, with Stone&#x27;s close friend and coworker Thomas Wentworth Higginson officiating. During the ceremony, Blackwell read the protest that both had signed:

:While acknowledging our mutual affection by publicly assuming the relationship of husband and wife, yet in justice to ourselves and a great principle, we deem it our duty to declare that this act on our part implies no sanction of or promise of voluntary obedience to such of the present laws of marriage as refuse to recognize the wife as an independent, rational being, while they confer upon the husband an injurious and unnatural superiority, investing him with legal powers which no honorable man should possess. We protest especially against the laws which give the husband:
::1. The custody of the wife&#x27;s person.
::2. The exclusive control and guardianship of their children.
::3. The sole ownership of her personal and use of her real estate, unless previously settled upon her or placed in the hands of trustees, as in the case of minors, idiots, and lunatics.
::4. The absolute right to the product of her industry.
::5. Also against laws which give to the widower so much larger and more permanent interest in the property of the deceased wife than they give to the widow in that of the deceased husband.
::6. Finally, against the whole system by which the legal existence of the wife is suspended during marriage, so that, in most States, she neither has a legal part in the choice of her residence, nor can she make a will, nor sue or be sued in her own name, nor inherit property.
:We believe that personal independence and equal human rights can never be forfeited except for crime; that marriage should be an equal and permanent partnership and so recognized by law; that until it is so recognized, married partners should provide against the radical injustice of present laws by every means in their power.
:We believe that where domestic difficulties arise, no appeal should be made to legal tribunals under existing laws, but that all difficulties should be submitted to the equitable adjustment of arbitrators mutually chosen.
:Thus, reverencing law, we enter our protest against rules and customs which are unworthy of the name since they violate justice, the essence of law.

News of the Stone-Blackwell marriage sped across the country after Higginson sent an announcement and copy of their protest to the &quot;Worcester Spy&quot;. While it drew amused ridicule from some commentators who viewed it as a protest against marriage itself, it inspired other couples to make similar protests part of their wedding ceremonies.

On Sunday, September 14, 1857, Blackwell was at home for the birth of the couple&#x27;s daughter, Alice, delivered by Blackwell&#x27;s sister Emily. Two years later, while the family was living temporarily in Chicago, Stone miscarried and they lost a baby boy.

==Business and investments==
In January 1856, Blackwell and his brother Sam sold their interests in the hardware company, and the entire family moved east. In October, Blackwell took a position with C. M. Saxton and Company, publisher of agricultural books. During his first year with the company, as he traveled through the west selling books to farmers’ libraries, he developed a new venture for the company – selling a collection of books suitable as a basic library for district schools. After consulting with the Illinois superintendent of schools, he compiled a list of appropriate books, arranged for special terms from publishers, and obtained a contract from the state of Illinois authorizing the firm to sell to school districts. However, when the Panic of 1857 threatened the firm&#x27;s survival, Blackwell withdrew until the company could reorganize. During the interlude, he worked as a bookkeeper for the Vanderbilt steamship line. When he returned to the book company at the end of August 1857, Augustus Moore had taken sole ownership and the firm was renamed the A.O. Moore Company. Moore put Blackwell in charge of the &quot;school libraries&quot; enterprise, and in the spring of 1858 Blackwell established an office in Chicago from which he obtained endorsements, arranged publicity, corresponded with school officials in each of the state&#x27;s one hundred counties, and hired agents to canvass the state. So successful was the venture that Blackwell contacted school officials in other states about introducing the books there and Moore doubled his salary to $3,000. The following year, Stone and their daughter accompanied him to Chicago, where the family lived for nine months while Blackwell managed the school libraries venture. When they returned in the fall of 1859, Moore&#x27;s failing health forced him to sell the company, and Blackwell left as well.
During the 1850s land boom, the entire Blackwell family were avid land speculators, purchasing land first in Illinois and later in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota. In December 1853, a group of Cincinnati businessmen hired Blackwell to be their agent in purchasing 640-acre sections of land in Wisconsin, which the government was selling on easy terms. As compensation, Blackwell received ten percent of the land he registered. By the time he married in the spring of 1855, Blackwell owned more than forty-eight hundred acres of Wisconsin land in addition to land he had purchased elsewhere.

When Lucy Stone married into the Blackwell family, she became an eager investor too but kept her purchases and accounts separate from her husband&#x27;s. In 1857 they took equal ownership in a house in Orange, New Jersey, for which they traded western lands. They later sold the house to make a down payment on a farm in Montclair, New Jersey, and traded more western land to purchase a neighboring tract. After their return from Illinois in September 1859, Blackwell opened a real estate business, through which, in addition to selling and trading for clients, he traded western land for eastern properties. In this way both he and Stone became owners of a string of rental properties. While they were &quot;land rich,&quot; they were &quot;cash poor,&quot; so to raise funds for tax and interest payments, Blackwell briefly sold kitchen stoves manufactured by fellow abolitionist Cornelius Bramhill and then, from 1862 to 1864, was bookkeeper for the sugar refining business of one of his father&#x27;s former employees.

In the summer of 1864, Blackwell sold a large property whose proceeds allowed him to pay off all his debt, including the mortgage on a house he and brother George had purchased for their mother, as well as purchase property on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and invest a large sum in government bonds. Additional land trades over the next few years and the rental income they produced gave Blackwell, as his daughter termed it, a &quot;competence&quot; that enabled him &quot;to devote himself fully to the progressive causes which he always had at heart.&quot; Around 1872, Stone told Francis J. Garrison in confidence that she and Blackwell could live on their income and thus &quot;cheerfully give&quot; their time and effort to the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Blackwell continued to dabble in business that interested him. In 1871 he was part of a presidential committee sent to Santo Domingo to explore commercial ramifications of a possible annexation, and even after annexation failed he continued to promote a model commercial base in the country. Blackwell continued to be keenly interested in developing a successful alternative to cane sugar as a means of combating slavery in the West Indies. After obtaining a patent for a new refining method, he established the Maine Sugar Beet Company in 1878. Although early in its operation he telegraphed Stone: &quot;Beet sugar manufacture a success. Slavery in Cuba is doomed,&quot; he and his partners found it impossible to obtain the quantity of sugar beets to keep the enterprise going, and shut the operation down in 1882.

==Work for Woman Suffrage==
In the early years of Blackwell&#x27;s marriage to Lucy Stone, he assisted her work whenever his business schedule permitted. In 1855, he lectured with her in and around Cincinnati during the summer, helped her manage the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention held in Cincinnati that fall, and arranged winter lecture engagements for her in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio. In 1856, he lectured with her in the region around their summer residence in Viroqua, Wisconsin. In the winter of 1857, when the tax bill came for their newly purchased house in Orange, New Jersey, Stone refused to pay on the basis of &quot;no taxation without representation.&quot; After submitting to a public auction of household items to pay the tax and attendant court costs, Blackwell and Stone lectured together in Orange on &quot;Taxation without Representation.&quot; It was in these February 1858 speeches that Blackwell first argued that woman suffrage was politically expedient no matter a party&#x27;s principles or goals: Enfranchising women, he said, would allow Republicans to more than double their influence toward abolishing slavery, the American Party to double the number of native-born voters, and Democrats to give votes to labor.

===Reconstruction issues===

In 1866, the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention, meeting for the first time since before the Civil War, voted itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA) to work for universal suffrage – the vote for both blacks and women. Blackwell served as secretary of this organization during its three-year existence. In the winter of 1866–67, Blackwell and Stone lectured together on universal suffrage and formed local Equal Rights Leagues in New York and New Jersey. They also traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby Charles Sumner against inclusion of the word &quot;male&quot; in the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, which would penalize states for denying black suffrage but not woman suffrage. Unsuccessful in persuading Northern politicians to use this opportunity to extend the franchise to women, Blackwell published an open letter to Southern legislators titled &quot;What the South Can Do,&quot; again arguing that woman suffrage was politically expedient no matter a party&#x27;s (or in this case, a region&#x27;s) goals or fears. Using estimated figures of a white male and female electorate and a black male and female electorate, he argued that the vote of white Southern women would counterbalance the combined vote of black men and women.

In the spring of 1867, the AWSA received an appeal for help from Kansas, where voters would face two suffrage referendums in the fall: one for removing the word &quot;male&quot; from voter qualifications, along with one for removing the word &quot;white.&quot; Blackwell and Stone left for Kansas in March and opened the campaign. They canvassed the state for two months, returned east full of optimism, and raised funds to send more speakers and tracts.

After their return, Blackwell and Stone also addressed a committee of the Connecticut Legislature in support of removing the word &quot;male&quot; from the state constitution&#x27;s voter qualifications. Blackwell served a second speaking stint in Kansas in the fall, during which defeat became apparent. Upon his return east, he and Stone turned their full attention to creating a demand for woman suffrage apart from the AERA&#x27;s call for universal suffrage. After holding a series of woman&#x27;s rights meetings across New Jersey, they called a state convention to form a state woman suffrage society. The object of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association that formed in November 1867 with Lucy Stone as president was to use all available means to secure woman suffrage.

At the AERA convention in May 1868, Stone presented two forms of petition to Congress, one for woman suffrage in the District of Columbia and territories, which could be established by an Act of Congress, and the second for a separate woman suffrage amendment to the federal Constitution. As the petitions circulated in both the east and the west during the following months, Blackwell and Stone continued organizing a woman suffrage movement separate from the AERA and its auxiliaries. In November 1868 they helped found a New England Woman Suffrage Association and in December they helped organize state societies in Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Believing their best chance for winning an amendment to a state constitution lay in Massachusetts, Blackwell spearheaded a movement to form Liberty Leagues across the state – local organizations of male suffragists who pledged to vote only for pro-woman suffrage candidates to the legislature.

After passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congressional Republicans began drafting a Fifteenth Amendment to explicitly prohibit states from denying the vote to black men. Again Blackwell and Stone traveled to Washington to lobby for the inclusion of woman suffrage, and again their efforts failed. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony mounted a campaign opposing any suffrage amendment that did not enfranchise women – seen by many as overt opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment. Disagreement over that amendment divided the May 1869 convention of the AERA. The convention rejected resolutions opposing the Fifteenth Amendment, and when Stanton and Anthony then proposed that the AERA reorganize as a woman suffrage society, the convention accepted Stone&#x27;s motion that it wait until after ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment so as not to give the appearance of opposition.

Nevertheless, two days later Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage Association, which immediately came out as opposed to the Fifteenth Amendment. With no notice having been given that such a society was to be formed, their critics thus excluded, and no representation from state and local woman suffrage associations then in existence, many long-time suffragists did not view the organization as legitimately &quot;national.&quot; The New England Woman Suffrage Association appointed a committee, headed by Stone, to call a convention to form a &quot;truly national&quot; woman suffrage organization with delegates from each state. The American Woman Suffrage Association was formed by a national convention meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 24 and 25, 1869. Blackwell drafted its constitution and was elected recording secretary.

===The &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;===
The New England Woman Suffrage Association also established the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a weekly woman suffrage newspaper that became the organ of the American, New England, and Massachusetts woman suffrage associations. Henry Blackwell donated the first $1,000 of the $10,000 raised to start the paper, was one of three trustees under whom the joint stock company was incorporated, and was always the paper&#x27;s largest shareholder.[44] In 1872, both he and Stone became editors and thereafter edited the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; together, joined by their daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell, in 1881. After Stone&#x27;s death in 1893, Blackwell continued editing until his death in 1909. He never took a salary for his work on the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, which became the longest-running suffrage paper in the nation (1870–1917).

===Campaigner and Strategist===
Blackwell was an officer of the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) for many years, including being its president in 1880. He was also an officer of the New England and Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Associations, all of which shared offices with the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; in Boston. Through involvement in Republican politics, he obtained a strong endorsement of woman suffrage from the Massachusetts Republican Party in 1872. As one of the American wing&#x27;s most effective orators, Blackwell spoke on organizing tours, before state and local suffrage meetings and conventions, at hearings before state legislatures and constitutional conventions, and at hearings before Congressional committees. He and Stone worked together on several state campaigns, including Colorado in 1877 and Nebraska in 1882. After frail health kept Stone from traveling, Blackwell continued on without her, campaigning in Rhode Island in 1887 and South Dakota in 1890. One scholar characterized their work saying, &quot;In the annals of the suffrage movement, Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell were as much a team as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.&quot; Stone thanked Blackwell for the &quot;abundant and unselfish work [he did] for women,&quot; saying, &quot;Few men would have done it, leaving business, friends, pleasure for it.&quot;

Blackwell originated the AWSA&#x27;s strategy of seeking partial suffrage by legislative action. Noting that state legislatures could establish women&#x27;s right to both municipal suffrage (the right to vote in city elections) and presidential suffrage (the right to vote for presidential electors) through statute, he argued that such measures might be more readily gained than constitutional amendments, which after passage by a legislature had to then be ratified by the populace. He also noted that no constitutional amendment was required for Congress to establish full woman suffrage in either the District of Columbia or the territories. Believing that achieving such measures would undercut arguments against women&#x27;s voting and become a permanent wedge for full suffrage, he urged that &quot;every point gained is a great step forward.&quot;

The AWSA campaigned widely for municipal and presidential suffrage, especially during the 1880s and 1890s. After the merger of the American and National wings in 1890, Blackwell was made chair of the united association&#x27;s Committee on Presidential Suffrage. Before the woman suffrage amendment to the federal Constitution passed in 1920, eleven states had established presidential suffrage, and four of those had granted municipal suffrage at the same time.

Another strategy Blackwell devised was aimed at constitutional conventions. In 1889 when the territories of North Dakota, Montana, and Washington began drafting state constitutions for entry into the Union, the AWSA mobilized to press for inclusion of woman suffrage. But Blackwell realized the chances for success were slim and devised a backup plan – persuading pro-suffrage delegates, if and when it became apparent a suffrage provision would fail, to push for a clause that would enable a future state legislature to extend suffrage to women by statute. Blackwell obtained endorsements for the strategy from leading politicians and judges in other states, traveled to the constitutional conventions, lobbied their leaders, got his resolution introduced, and was given a hearing at each one. Though the effort failed, North Dakota and Montana came very close to adopting it.

==Death==
Blackwell died of inflammation of the bowels in 1909.

==Legacy==
Alice Stone Blackwell, the daughter of Blackwell and Lucy Stone, helped her parents in editing the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;; she became another leader for women&#x27;s rights as well as for the Temperance movement and Prohibition.

<doc id="1059566" wikidata="Q2563685" url="?curid=1059566" title="Brenda Villa">
<text>Brenda Villa (born April 18, 1980) is an American accomplished water polo player. She is the most decorated athlete in the world of women’s water polo. Villa was named Female Water Polo Player of the Decade for 2000-2009 by the FINA Aquatics World Magazine. She is one of four female players who competed in water polo at four Olympics; and one of two female athletes who won four Olympic medals in water polo. She is a leading goalscorer in Olympic water polo history, with 31 goals. In 2018, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame and the USA Water Polo Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Villa started swimming with a club team, Commerce Aquatics, at the age of six, and followed her brother into water polo at eight years old. She made the girls Junior Olympic Team while in high school. At Bell Gardens High School, Villa played with the boys&#x27; water polo team because her school did not have a girls&#x27; team, and went on to become a 4-time 1st team All-League, 4-time 1st team All-C.I.F. and 4-time All-American.

Villa came to Stanford in 1998 as the program’s most heralded recruit. Redshirted in 1999 and 2000 to train for the Olympics, she scored 69 goals her freshman year (2001) and was named the NCAA Women’s Water Polo Player of the Year. In the three seasons Villa played for Stanford University, she scored 172 goals. In 2002, she led her Stanford team with 60 goals to win the NCAA Women&#x27;s Water Polo Championship; they had finished second the previous season, the first year the competition was held. Villa was awarded the 2002 Peter J. Cutino Award as the top female college water polo player in the United States.

Villa retired in 2012 and took up coaching waterpolo and swimming at a private all-girl high school.

==Olympics and international==
Villa has been on Team USA since 1998. Although the shortest player on the US national women&#x27;s water polo team at 5&#x27;4&quot;, Villa has been a prolific scorer at the international level. She scored 10 goals for Team USA at the 2003 Pan American Games, which qualified the team for the 2004 Summer Olympics. As a 20-year-old, she led the US team with nine goals at the Sydney Olympics, where the Americans took the silver medal. She had a team-high 13 goals to lead the US to gold at the 2003 FINA Water Polo World Championship. In June 2004, Villa scored the first goal in overtime, her third of the game, and another in a penalty shootout, to propel the US team past Hungary and win the gold medal at the Women&#x27;s Water Polo World League Super Finals. She was the US women&#x27;s team top scorer with 7 goals in 5 games at the 2004 Athens Olympics, earning a bronze medal. Villa was team captain of the 2005 US national team coached by two-time Olympian Heather Moody, winning a silver medal at the FINA World Championship in Montreal.

In 2005, Villa became assistant coach of the women&#x27;s water polo team at Cerritos College in Norwalk, California. The Falcons ended the season with a 21-11 record, a new school record for most wins in a season. She spent five years with the Falcons and helped them to a combined 145-26 record from 2005–09, which included the team winning their only CCCAA State Championship in school history (2008). She is now playing professionally for the Italian power team Geymonat Orizzonte in Catania, Sicily, which won the LEN Women&#x27;s Champions&#x27; Cup in 2005 and 2006.

In March 2007 Villa led the USA women&#x27;s national water polo team in Melbourne, Australia, at the 2007 FINA World Water Polo Championships. Villa scored a total of 11 goals throughout the whole tournament helping team USA achieve first place naming them the 2007 FINA World Champions.

At the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, she and the American team lost 8-9 in the championship game to the Netherlands and took home the silver medal.

In June 2009, Villa was named to the USA water polo women&#x27;s senior national team for the 2009 FINA World Championships. In 2010, she became the head coach at Castilleja High School for girls&#x27; water polo in Palo Alto, California.

At the 2012 London Summer Olympics, she and the American team won 8-5 in the championship game to Spain and took home the gold medal, the Americans&#x27; first in 4 Olympics water polo competitions.

<doc id="1059568" wikidata="Q2325220" url="?curid=1059568" title="Counsellor of State">
<text>Counsellors of State are senior members of the British royal family to whom the monarch can delegate royal functions through letters patent under the Great Seal, to prevent delay or difficulty in the dispatch of public business in the case of their illness (except total incapacity) or of their intended or actual absence from the United Kingdom.

Counsellors of state may carry out &quot;such of the royal functions as may be specified in the Letters Patent&quot;. In practice, this means most of the monarch&#x27;s official duties, such as attending Privy Council meetings, signing routine documents and receiving the credentials of new ambassadors to the Court of St James&#x27;s. However, by law, counsellors of state cannot grant ranks, titles or peerages. They also, by the terms of the letters patent, cannot deal with a number of core constitutional functions, such as Commonwealth matters, the dissolution of Parliament (except on the monarch&#x27;s express instruction) and the appointment of prime ministers. A rare example occurred on 7 February 1974 of the Proclamation of the Dissolution of Parliament being promulgated by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret as counsellors of state, on the express instructions of Queen Elizabeth II.

Royal functions are to be exercised jointly by the counsellors of state or by such number of them as is specified in the letters patent under the Great Seal and subject to any other conditions within. However, there is a legal presumption that counsellors of state should act jointly and, as such, at least two are needed to act, with the absence of one possibly risking a legal challenge.

Counsellors of state are always the monarch&#x27;s spouse and the next four people in the line of succession who meet the following specifications: they must be British subjects of full age (21 years, or 18 years for the heir apparent or presumptive) who are domiciled in the United Kingdom and not disqualified from becoming monarch. During a regency, the next four eligible people in the line of succession after the regent (and the regent&#x27;s spouse) may be counsellors. A monarch may also request that Parliament add specific people to their counsellors of state. This was done by Queen Elizabeth II leading to section 3 of the Regency Act 1953 and by King Charles III leading to the Counsellors of State Act 2022.

==History==
The first counsellors of state were appointed by George V under the royal prerogative in 1911 when he traveled to India for the Delhi Durbar, and they continued to be appointed under the prerogative for the rest of his reign. At first, senior politicians such as the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor could serve as counsellors of state, but later counsellors of state were drawn exclusively from the ranks of the Royal Family. The Regency Act 1937 (1 Edw. 8 &amp; 1 Geo. 6. c. 16) ultimately placed the appointment of counsellors of state on a statutory footing and codified the practice of only entrusting the role to senior members of the Royal Family.

Since the passage of the Regency Act 1937, the only persons to have been counsellors of state while not a queen consort, prince, or princess were George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood; Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (although Windsor had been a prince between 1914 and 1917 and never served in practice during his short tenure); and Maud Carnegie, Countess of Southesk (who was entitled to the style of princess but did not use it). Prior to that, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the prime minister, and the Archbishop of Canterbury had been appointed to the position by George V.

Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother lost her eligibility to be a counsellor of state in 1952 upon the death of her husband, King George VI. Section 3 of the Regency Act 1953, however, restored her position. The provision was specific to her, rather than applying to dowager consorts generally, and became spent upon her death in 2002.

In September 2022, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that King Charles III wanted the law to be amended to allow only working members of the royal family to serve as counsellors of state. This would take away the eligibility of family members that do not carry out official functions, while creating a possibility for spouses to senior ranking members and those with a lower position in the line of succession to be called upon and fulfil the role.

Questions were raised in the House of Lords in October 2022 by Lord Stansgate about the &quot;suitability&quot; of having the Duke of York and Duke of Sussex as counsellors of state when the former had &quot;left public life&quot; and the latter had &quot;left the country&quot;. It was subsequently reported that, instead of removing them from the list of counsellors of state, it was being proposed that the pool of counsellors be expanded in order to create a more flexible list of available royals to stand in for the King if needed. On 14 November 2022, the King sent a message to both Houses of Parliament, formally asking for a change in the law that would allow Princess Anne and Prince Edward to be added to the list of counsellors of state. The next day, a bill to that end was introduced in Parliament and it received royal assent on 6 December, coming into force on 7 December as the Counsellors of State Act 2022.

==List of current counsellors of state==
As of 7 December 2022, those eligible to be appointed counsellors of state to King Charles III are:

Of these seven, Prince Andrew, Prince Harry, and Princess Beatrice do not perform royal duties. If Prince Harry ceases to be domiciled in the United Kingdom, he shall become ineligible to be a counsellor of state.

Prince Andrew remains eligible to serve in this role, though he has withdrawn from most royal activities; this provoked by a backlash due to the allegations of sexual abuse made against him. In practice, only members of the royal family that perform public duties on behalf of the monarch would be appointed as counsellors of state, thus eliminating the possibility of Harry, Andrew or Beatrice serving in this role.

Should any of the above, other than the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh or the Princess Royal, become ineligible or unable to serve, the next person eligible would be Princess Eugenie. Prince George is to automatically become a counsellor of state on his 21st birthday on 22 July 2034 (or his 18th birthday should he be the heir apparent at that time), and would replace Princess Beatrice.

<doc id="1059577" wikidata="Q6504605" url="?curid=1059577" title="Lawrence Springborg">
<text>Lawrence James Springborg (born 17 February 1968) is an Australian politician. He led the National Party in the Queensland Parliament from 2003 to 2006 and again in 2008, before becoming the first leader of the merged Liberal National Party from 2008 to 2009. He led the LNP again from 2015 to 2016 before announcing his retirement. He currently serves as Mayor of Goondiwindi Regional Council, having been elected in March 2020.

As Leader of the Queensland branch of the National Party, he led the National-Liberal coalition to defeats at both the 2004 and 2006 Queensland elections. He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him.

Following this defeat, Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party&#x27;s first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney, respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office. On 6 May 2016, Springborg lost the leadership of the LNP to Tim Nicholls.

==Early life==
Born in 1968, Lawrence Springborg resided in the town Yelarbon for much of his younger life. He left school at the age of 14 and went on to work a farm on Queensland&#x27;s Darling Downs for seven years before he was elected to Parliament in 1989 at the age of 21.

==Parliamentary career==
In the 1989 Queensland state election, Springborg became the youngest person elected to the Parliament of Queensland, winning the safe Nationals seat of Carnarvon on the Darling Downs. In the same year, the 32-year reign of the Nationals at the State level drew to a close. Springborg represented a new generation of Nationals not associated with the era of long-serving former Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the allegations of corruption and maladministration arising from the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Subsequent redistributions forced Springborg to relocate to his later seat in Southern Downs.

The Nationals remained in opposition until 1996, when the Goss Labor government lost office following the 1995 state election and a consequential adverse finding in the Queensland Court of Disputed Returns and subsequent by-election loss of the seat of Mundingburra by Labor led the resignation of the then Premier Wayne Goss. The reformed National-Liberal coalition took power under Rob Borbidge but only with the support of independent MLA Liz Cunningham. In 1998, shortly before the Borbidge government lost office, Springborg was sworn in as Minister for Natural Resources, again setting a record as Queensland&#x27;s youngest ever minister. In February 1999, he was as elected Deputy National Leader.

The 2001 state elections saw a massive win for the Labor Party, with Premier Peter Beattie going from a one-seat to twenty-two seat majority, and the Nationals reduced to 12 seats out of the 89-seat Parliament. After the election loss, the Coalition with the Liberals was ended and Springborg was reelected Deputy Opposition Leader.

Borbidge subsequently resigned as Leader of the Nationals and his place was taken by Mike Horan, father of international Rugby Union player Tim Horan. After widespread speculation and criticism, the Nationals elected Springborg as leader in 2003.

==2004 election==
The campaign for the 2004 state election relied heavily on Springborg&#x27;s personal profile. He literally ran for much of the campaign, appearing to be jogging through state forests on electoral advertising, emphasising his physical fitness. The Nationals marketed Springborg merchandise extensively, including life-size cardboard cutouts. In a move unthinkable for Nationals of an earlier era, he appeared in a &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; photograph clad only in a towel and ironing his own shirt.

==2006 election==
As water management became an increasingly important issue during the drought, Springborg criticised Labor&#x27;s handling of the water issue. Amid speculation that the 2006 state election election would be called early, the Liberal Party deposed Quinn and elected Bruce Flegg as leader in his place, who has in the past had a poor relationship with Springborg. Springborg pressed Beattie to serve a full term and not call an election before one was due. On 15 August 2006, Beattie called an election for 9 September of that year. Springborg again conceded defeat at 8pm on 9 September 2006.

In the wake of his second election defeat, he announced his resignation as leader of the National Party on 14 September 2006. His former deputy, Jeff Seeney, ascended to the leadership position uncontested on 18 September 2006, alongside Maroochydore representative Fiona Simpson as Deputy Leader.

==Political comeback and Conservative merger==
After Deputy Fiona Simpson withdrew her support for current leader Jeff Seeney, he announced a partyroom challenge to take place on 21 January 2008, with former leader Springborg the front runner.
Springborg won the challenge and like his rolling of Mike Horan in 2003, Springborg&#x27;s rolling of Seeney meant that Springborg once again ousted a leader prior to this leader being given a chance to lead his party into an election.

After resuming the leadership, he began renewed talks of a merger to form a single &#x27;non-Labor force&#x27; in Queensland. On 26 July 2008 this became reality when both parties voted to form the Liberal National Party of Queensland.

The failure of the two conservative parties to sign a new Coalition agreement convinced Springborg of the need to merge the Liberals and Nationals at a state level. Presenting a proposal modelled on the Conservative Party of Canada, Springborg went about campaigning through 2004 for the support of both state party organisations in creating a new unified party.

Prior to the 2006 state election, Springborg&#x27;s proposal ran into early hurdles when John Howard, John Anderson, and other federal Coalition identities dismissed the idea of a state-level merger. Bob Quinn and the state Liberals reacted cautiously, ultimately rebuffing Springborg&#x27;s efforts. However, Springborg did attract strong support for the idea from the National Party at a state organisational level, with the central executive supporting his proposal in February 2005. Springborg toned down some of his advocacy, however, and was content to announce a renewal of the Coalition agreement with the Liberals on 26 September 2005, aiming to maximise Labor&#x27;s trouble regarding the scandal instigated by Dr Jayant Patel and the Bundaberg public hospital.

On 29 May 2006, plans for merger received a new life when the state division of the Liberal party announced its in-principle support for the idea. State director Graeme Greene stated that the merged party &quot;would effectively operate under the federal Liberal Party&#x27;s model&quot;.

However, senior figures within both the National and Liberal parties, particularly federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile, quickly spoke out against the proposed merger. By the end of the week, Springborg had to rescind his proposal.

On 26 July 2008, his vision of a united non-Labor force in Queensland finally became reality when both parties voted to form the Liberal National Party of Queensland. He has been described as the &quot;father of the party&quot; by successor, John-Paul Langbroek.

==2009 election==
Springborg led the LNP into the 2009 Queensland election; despite opinion polls predicting a close contest, the ALP led by Anna Bligh retained government. A 20-seat swing to the LNP would have been required to deliver majority government. Springborg led the LNP to an eight percent swing and took 10 seats from Labor, the largest swing to the conservatives in over 14 years. However, the LNP came up 11 seats short of making Springborg premier, largely due to winning only six seats in Brisbane. Following his third electoral defeat, Springborg announced his retirement as party leader and instead was elected deputy leader under John-Paul Langbroek.

Springborg, along with the entire Liberal National Party, supported changes to Queensland&#x27;s abortion laws. Springborg resigned as deputy leader on 22 March 2011, after Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman announced he was launching a challenge for the LNP leadership.

==2015 election==
The LNP won the biggest majority government in Queensland history at the 2012 election, only to lose it after one term at the 2015 election. Newman lost his own seat, and Springborg was elected LNP leader for the second time. He briefly harboured hope of becoming premier in a minority government, but this was brought undone when independent Peter Wellington threw his support to Labor. Springborg thus became leader of the opposition for the third time.

===Loss of leadership===
Springborg lost the leadership to Tim Nicholls on 6 May 2016 in a leadership spill, by 22 votes to 19. On 3 December 2016, he announced his retirement from politics at the next Queensland state election.

Months before losing the leadership, there was speculation that Springborg would make a switch to federal politics and therefore resign the leadership by seeking preselection for the safe National seat of Maranoa following incumbent and Deputy Speaker Bruce Scott&#x27;s announcement that he would be retiring at the next election due in 2016 but Springborg ruled this out.

==Local politics==
In November 2019, he announced he would be standing as a candidate for Mayor of Goondiwindi Regional Council in the March 2020 election. He was elected unopposed.

<doc id="1059585" wikidata="Q210697" url="?curid=1059585" title="Hypermagnesemia">
<text>Hypermagnesemia is an electrolyte disorder in which there is a high level of magnesium in the blood. Symptoms include weakness, confusion, decreased breathing rate, and decreased reflexes. Hypermagnesemia can greatly increase the chances of adverse cardiovascular events. Complications may include low blood pressure and cardiac arrest.
It is typically caused by kidney failure or is treatment-induced such as from antacids or supplements that contain magnesium. Less common causes include tumor lysis syndrome, seizures, and prolonged ischemia. Diagnosis is based on a blood level of magnesium greater than 1.1mmol/L (2.6 mg/dL). It is severe if levels are greater than 2.9 mmol/L (7 mg/dL). Specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes may be present.
Treatment involves stopping the magnesium a person is getting. Treatment when levels are very high include calcium chloride, intravenous normal saline with furosemide, and hemodialysis. Hypermagnesemia is uncommon. Rates among hospitalized patients in renal failure may be as high as 10%.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include weakness, confusion, decreased breathing rate, and decreased reflexes. As well as nausea, low blood pressure, low blood calcium, abnormal heart rhythms and asystole, dizziness, and sleepiness.

Abnormal heart rhythms and asystole are possible complications of hypermagnesemia related to the heart. Magnesium acts as a physiologic calcium blocker, which results in abnormalities of the electrical conduction system of the heart.

Consequences related to serum concentration:
* 4.0 mEq/L – Decreased reflexes
* &gt;5.0 mEq/L – Prolonged atrioventricular conduction
* &gt;10.0 mEq/L – Third-degree atrioventricular block (AV block)
* &gt;13.0 mEq/L – Cardiac arrest
At magnesium levels about 4.5 mEq/L the stretch reflex is lost and with over 6.5 mEq/L respiratory failure may be observed. On ECG hypermagnesemia is mainly manifested by prolongation of PR and QRS intervals, T wave changes and AV block.

The therapeutic range for the prevention of the pre-eclamptic uterine contractions is: 4.0–7.0 mEq/L. As per Lu and Nightingale, serum magnesium concentrations associated with maternal toxicity (also neonate depression, hypotonia and low Apgar scores) are:
* 7.0–10.0 mEq/L – Loss of patellar reflex
* 10.0-13.0 mEq/L – Respiratory depression
* 15.0-25.0 mEq/L – Altered atrioventricular conduction and (further) complete heart block
* &gt;25.0 mEq/L – Cardiac arrest
===Complications===
Severe hypermagnesemia (levels greater than 12 mg/dL) can lead to cardiovascular complications (hypotension and arrhythmias) and neurological disorder (confusion and lethargy). Higher values of serum magnesium (exceeding 15 mg/dL) can induce cardiac arrest and coma. 

==Causes==
Magnesium status depends on three organs: uptake in the intestine, storage in the bone, and excretion in the kidneys. Hypermagnesemia is therefore often due to problems in these organs, mostly the intestine or kidney.

===Predisposing conditions===
* Hemolysis, magnesium concentration in red blood cells is approximately three times greater than in serum, therefore hemolysis can increase plasma magnesium. Hypermagnesemia is expected only in massive hemolysis.
* Chronic kidney disease, excretion of magnesium becomes impaired when creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/min. However, hypermagnesemia is not a prominent feature of chronic kidney disease unless magnesium intake is increased.
* Magnesium toxicity from emergency pre-eclampsia treatment during labor and delivery.
* Other conditions that can predispose to mild hypermagnesemia are diabetic ketoacidosis, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and lithium intoxication.

===Metabolism===
For a detailed description of magnesium homeostasis and metabolism see hypomagnesemia.

==Diagnosis==
Hypermagnesemia is diagnosed by measuring the concentration of magnesium in the blood. Concentrations of magnesium greater than 1.1 mmol/L are considered diagnostic.

==Treatment==
People with normal kidney function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over 60 ml/min) and mild asymptomatic hypermagnesemia require no treatment except for the removal of all sources of exogenous magnesium. One must consider that the half-time of elimination of magnesium is approximately 28 hours.

In more severe cases, close monitoring of the ECG, blood pressure, and neuromuscular function and early treatment are necessary:

Intravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride since the actions of magnesium in neuromuscular and cardiac function become antagonized by calcium.

Severe clinical conditions require increasing renal magnesium excretion through:

Intravenous loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide), or hemodialysis, when kidney function is impaired, or the patient is symptomatic from severe hypermagnesemia. This approach usually removes magnesium efficiently (up to 50% reduction after a 3- to 4-hour treatment). Dialysis can, however, increase the excretion of calcium by developing hypocalcemia, thus possibly worsening the symptoms and signs of hypermagnesemia.

The use of diuretics must be associated with infusions of saline solutions to avoid further electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia) and metabolic alkalosis. The clinician must perform serial measurements of calcium and magnesium. In association with electrolytic correction, it is often necessary to support cardiorespiratory activity. As a consequence, the treatment of this electrolyte disorder can frequently require intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Particular clinical conditions require a specific approach. For instance, during the management of eclampsia, the magnesium infusion is stopped if urine output drops to less than 80 mL (in 4 hours), deep tendon reflexes are absent, or the respiratory rate is below 12 breaths/minute. A 10% calcium gluconate or chloride solution can serve as an antidote.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of hypermagnesemia depends on magnesium values and on the clinical condition that induced hypermagnesemia. Values that are not excessively high (mild hypermagnesemia) and in the absence of triggering and aggravating conditions (e.g., chronic kidney disease) are benign conditions. On the contrary, high values (severe hypermagnesemia) expose the patient to high risks and high mortality.
==Epidemiology==
Hypermagnesemia is an uncommon electrolyte disorder. It occurs in approximately 10 to 15% of hospitalized patients with renal failure. Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that there is a significant prevalence of high levels of serum magnesium in selected healthy populations. For instance the overall prevalence of hypermagnesemia was 3.0%, especially in males in Iran. High magnesium concentrations were typical in people with cardiovascular disease, and 2.3 mg/dL or higher values were associated with worse hospital mortality.

<doc id="1059591" wikidata="Q5898267" url="?curid=1059591" title="Hyperchloremia">
<text>Hyperchloremia is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is an elevated level of chloride ions in the blood. The normal serum range for chloride is 96 to 106 mEq/L, therefore chloride levels at or above 110 mEq/L usually indicate kidney dysfunction as it is a regulator of chloride concentration. As of now there are no specific symptoms of hyperchloremia; however, it can be influenced by multiple abnormalities that cause a loss of electrolyte-free fluid, loss of hypotonic fluid, or increased administration of sodium chloride. These abnormalities are caused by diarrhea, vomiting, increased sodium chloride intake, renal dysfunction, diuretic use, and diabetes. Hyperchloremia should not be mistaken for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is characterized by two major changes: a decrease in blood pH and bicarbonate levels, as well as an increase in blood chloride levels. Instead those with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis are usually predisposed to hyperchloremia.

Hyperchloremia prevalence in hospital settings has been researched in the medical field since one of the major sources of treatment at hospitals is administering saline solution. Previously, animal models with elevated chloride have displayed more inflammation markers, changes in blood pressure, increased renal vasoconstriction, and less renal blood flow as well at glomerulus filtration, all of which are prompting researchers to investigate if these changes or others may exist in patients. Some studies have reported a possible relationship between increased chloride levels and death or acute kidney injury in severely ill patients that may frequent the hospital or have prolonged visits. There are other studies that have found no relationship. 

==Symptoms==
Hyperchloremia does not have many noticeable symptoms and can only be confirmed with testing, yet, the causes of hyperchloremia do have symptoms.

Symptoms of the above stated abnormalities may include: 
*Dehydration - due to diarrhea, vomiting, sweating 
*Hypertension - due to increased sodium chloride intake 
*Cardiovascular dysfunction - due to increased sodium chloride intake
*Edema - due to influx in sodium in the body
*Weakness - due to loss of fluids 
*Thirst - due to loss of fluids 
*Kussmaul breathing - due to high ion concentrations, loss of fluids, or kidney failure 
*High blood sugar - due to diabetes 
*Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis - due to severe diarrhea and/or kidney failure
*Respiratory alkalosis - due to renal dysfunction 
*

==Causes ==
There are many scenarios which may results in hyperchloremia. The first instance is when there is a loss of electrolyte-free fluid. This simply means that the body is losing increased amounts of fluids that do not contain electrolytes, like chloride, resulting in high concentration of these ions in the body. This loss of fluids can be due to sweating (due to exercise or fever), skin burns, lack of adequate water intake, hyper-metabolic state, and diabetes insipidus. Losing fluids can lead to feelings of dehydration and dry mucous membrane.

The second scenario that may lead to hyperchloremia is known as loss of hypotonic fluid which can be a direct result of loss of electrolyte fluid. Normally, water in the body is moving from an area of low ion concentration to an area of high ion concentration. In this case, the water is being excreted in the urine, therefore, less water is available to dilute these areas of high ion concentration. This can be due to diuretic use, diarrhea, vomiting, burns, kidney disease, kidney failure, and renal tubular acidosis . This may also lead to feeling of dehydration.

The third scenario that may lead to hyperchloremia is an increase in sodium chloride intake. This can be due to dietary intake or intravenous fluid administration in hospital settings. This can lead to the body experiencing hypertension, edema, and cardiovascular dysfunction.

==Mechanism ==
The nephrons in the kidney are responsible for regulating the level of chloride in the blood. The general mechanism is that as filtrate fluid passes through the nephrons varying concentrations of ions will be secreted into the interstitial fluid or absorbed into the lumen. All along the nephrons are blood capillaries waiting to reabsorb ions from the interstitial fluid to circulate in the body. The amount of chloride to be released in the urine is due to the receptors lining the nephrons and the glomerulus filtration.

Normally, chloride reabsorption begins in the proximal tubule and nearly 60% of chloride is filtered here. In a person with hyperchloremia, the absorption of chloride into the interstitial fluid and subsequently into the blood capillaries is increased. This means the concentration of chloride in the filtrate is decreased, therefore, a decreased amount of chloride is being excreted as waste in the urine. In the proximal tubule chloride reabsorption occurs in two parts. In the 1st phase, organic solutes (such as phosphates, amino acids, glucose and anions), sodium ions, and hydronium ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate fluid into the interstitial fluid. This is an important step because this creates the concentration gradient in which chloride concentration in the lumen will increase in comparison to the chloride concentration in the interstitial fluid. In phase 2, chloride will diffuse along the concentration gradient, which means chloride ions will travel from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.

One suggested mechanism leading to hyperchloremia, there is a decrease in chloride transporter proteins along the nephron. These proteins may include sodium-potassium-2 chloride co-transporter, chloride anion exchangers, and chloride channels. Another suggested mechanism is a depletion in concentration gradient as a result of the reduced activity in these transporters. Such concentration gradient depletion would allow for the passive diffusion of chloride in and out the tubule.

==Diagnosis==
Elevated levels of chloride in the blood can be tested simply by requesting a serum chloride test. A doctor would request this test if there are signs their patient is experiencing an imbalance in acid-base levels for a prolonged period of time. For the test to occur a healthcare provider must draw a sample of blood from the patient. The sample will then be sent to a laboratory and results will be provided to the patient&#x27;s physician. As mentioned earlier a normal serum chloride range is from 96 to 106 mEq/L, and hyperchloremic patients will have levels above this range.

==Treatment ==
As with most types of electrolyte imbalance, the treatment of high blood chloride levels is based on correcting the underlying cause.

*If the patient is dehydrated, therapy consists of establishing and maintaining adequate hydration such as drinking 2-3 quarts of water daily. Also, to alleviate symptoms of dehydration like diarrhea or vomiting, it is suggested to take medication. 
*If the condition is caused or exacerbated by medications or treatments, these may be altered or discontinued, if deemed prudent. 
*If there is underlying kidney disease (which is likely if there are other electrolyte disturbances), then the patient will be referred to a nephrologist for further care.
*If there is an underlying dysfunction of the endocrine or hormone system, the patient will likely be referred to an endocrinologist for further assessment.
*If the electrolyte imbalance is due to influx of sodium chloride in the body, then it has been suggested to make dietary changes or reduce the rate of administering intravenous fluids.

==Recent research==
In patients with sepsis or septic shock they are more susceptible to experience acute kidney injury (AKI) and the factors that may contribute to AKI are still being investigated. In a study conducted by Suetrong et al., (2016) using patients admitted to St. Paul Hospital in Vancouver with sepsis or septic shock had their body concentration of chloride checked over the course of 48 hours to determine if there is a relation between hyperchloremia and AKI. This is an important relationship to study because many times a form of therapy to treat sepsis and septic shock is to administer saline solution, which is a solution containing sodium chloride. Saline has a much higher concentration of chloride than does blood. In this study they defined hyperchloremia as concentration of chloride greater than 110 mmol/L. This research demonstrated that hyperchloremia will influence a patient developing AKI. In fact, even patients that had a conservative increase in serum chloride saw some association with developing AKI. This research study suggest that there still needs to be more investigation in the risk of using saline as a form of therapy and the risk of experiencing AKI.

In a separate study investigating the relation of critically ill patients and hyperchloremia, researchers found that there seems to be an independent association between ill patients with hyperchloremia and mortality. This study was conducted with septic patients admitted to ICUs for 72 hours. Chloride levels were assessed at baseline and 72 hours, and confounding variables were accounted for. This study is important because this continues to suggest there is increased risk associated with elevated chloride levels in vulnerable populations. Their article also states there needs to be avoidance of using solutions with chloride in specific patient subgroups 

Several trials have been done comparing balanced fluid (chloride restricted) solution with saline (chloride liberal) with the hypothesis that it may reduce the risk of AKI and mortality. Initial randomized trials in septic shock comparing Plasma-Lyte and 0.9% saline (SPLIT and SALT trials) did not show any risk reduction in AKI. However, the later trials with larger sample size in critically and non critically ill adults (SMART and SALT-ED trials) showed reduction in major adverse kidney events. Extrapolating from the findings of septic shock, a recent trial comparing plasmalyte with 0.9% saline in DKA also did not show any significant difference in AKI. Hence, the causal link between hyperchloremia and AKI is yet to be conclusively established.

As studies continue, it is important to include a large patient sample size, a diverse patient population, and a diverse range of hospitals involved in these studies.

<text>Hypochloremia (or Hypochloraemia) is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is an abnormally low level of the chloride ion in the blood. The normal serum range for chloride is 97 to 107 mEq/L.

It rarely occurs in the absence of other abnormalities. It is sometimes associated with hypoventilation. It can be associated with chronic respiratory acidosis. If it occurs together with metabolic alkalosis (decreased blood acidity) it is often due to vomiting. It is usually the result of hyponatremia or elevated bicarbonate concentration. It occurs in cystic fibrosis.

<doc id="1059597" wikidata="Q1641062" url="?curid=1059597" title="Hyperphosphatemia">
<text>Hyperphosphatemia is an electrolyte disorder in which there is an elevated level of phosphate in the blood. Most people have no symptoms while others develop calcium deposits in the soft tissue. The disorder is often accompanied by low calcium blood levels, which can result in muscle spasms.
Causes include kidney failure, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, diabetic ketoacidosis, tumor lysis syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis. Diagnosis is generally based on a blood phosphate level exceeding 1.46 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL). Levels may appear falsely elevated with high blood lipid levels, high blood protein levels, or high blood bilirubin levels.
Treatment may include a phosphate low diet and antacids like calcium carbonate that bind phosphate. Occasionally, intravenous normal saline or kidney dialysis may be used. How commonly it occurs is unclear.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms include ectopic calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and renal osteodystrophy. Abnormalities in phosphate metabolism such as hyperphosphatemia are included in the definition of the new chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD–MBD).

==Causes==

Hypoparathyroidism: In this situation, there are low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH normally inhibits reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney. Therefore, without enough PTH there is more reabsorption of the phosphate leading to a high phosphate level in the blood.

Chronic kidney failure: When the kidneys are not working well, there will be increased phosphate retention.

Drugs: hyperphosphatemia can also be caused by taking oral sodium phosphate solutions prescribed for bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia is made through measuring the concentration of phosphate in the blood. A phosphate concentration greater than 1.46 mmol/L (4.5 mg/dL) is indicative of hyperphosphatemia, though further tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of the elevated phosphate levels. It is considered significant when levels are greater than 1.6 mmol/L (5 mg/dL).

===Units===
Phosphates in blood exist in a chemical equilibrium of hydrogen phosphate (HPO42–) and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4–), which have different masses. Phosphate (PO43–) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) are not present in significant amounts. Thus millimoles per liter (mmol/L) are often used to denote the phosphate concententration. If milligrams per decililiter (mg/dL) is used, it often denotes the &quot;mass of phosphorus&quot; bound to phosphates, but not the mass of some individual phosphate.

==Treatment==
High phosphate levels can be avoided with phosphate binders and dietary restriction of phosphate. If the kidneys are operating normally, a saline diuresis can be induced to renally eliminate the excess phosphate. In extreme cases, the blood can be filtered in a process called hemodialysis, removing the excess phosphate. Phosphate-binding medications include sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate, calcium carbonate, and calcium acetate. Previously aluminum hydroxide was the medication of choice, but its use has been largely abandoned due to the increased risk of aluminum toxicity.

<doc id="1059599" wikidata="Q1641384" url="?curid=1059599" title="Hypophosphatemia">
<text>Hypophosphatemia is an electrolyte disorder in which there is a low level of phosphate in the blood. Symptoms may include weakness, trouble breathing, and loss of appetite. Complications may include seizures, coma, rhabdomyolysis, or softening of the bones.
Causes include alcohol use disorder, refeeding in those with malnutrition, recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, burns, hyperventilation, and certain medications. It may also occur in the setting of hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, and Cushing syndrome. It is diagnosed based on a blood phosphate concentration of less than 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). When levels are below 0.32 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) it is deemed to be severe.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Phosphate may be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Hypophosphatemia occurs in about 2% of people within hospital and 70% of people in the intensive care unit (ICU).

==Signs and symptoms==
* Muscle dysfunction and weakness – This occurs in major muscles, but also may manifest as: diplopia, low cardiac output, dysphagia, and respiratory depression due to respiratory muscle weakness.
* Mental status changes – This may range from irritability to gross confusion, delirium, and coma.
* White blood cell dysfunction, causing worsening of infections.
* Instability of cell membranes due to low adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels – This may cause rhabdomyolysis with increased serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, and also hemolytic anemia.
* Increased affinity for oxygen in the blood caused by decreased production of 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid.
* If hypophosphatemia is chronic; rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults may develop.

==Causes==
* Refeeding syndrome – This causes a demand for phosphate in cells due to the action of hexokinase, an enzyme that attaches phosphate to glucose to begin metabolism of glucose. Also, production of ATP when cells are fed and recharge their energy supplies requires phosphate. A similar mechanism is seen in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be complicated by respiratory failure in these cases due to respiratory muscle weakness.
* Respiratory alkalosis – Any alkalemic condition moves phosphate out of the blood into cells. This includes most common respiratory alkalemia (a higher than normal blood pH from low carbon dioxide levels in the blood), which in turn is caused by any hyperventilation (such as may result from sepsis, fever, pain, anxiety, drug withdrawal, and many other causes). This phenomenon is seen because in respiratory alkalosis carbon dioxide (CO2) decreases in the extracellular space, causing intracellular CO2 to freely diffuse out of the cell. This drop in intracellular CO2 causes a rise in cellular pH which has a stimulating effect on glycolysis. Since the process of glycolysis requires phosphate (the end product is adenosine triphosphate), the result is a massive uptake of phosphate into metabolically active tissue (such as muscle) from the serum. However, that this effect is not seen in metabolic alkalosis, for in such cases the cause of the alkalosis is increased bicarbonate rather than decreased CO2. Bicarbonate, unlike CO2, has poor diffusion across the cellular membrane and therefore there is little change in intracellular pH.
* Alcohol use disorder – Alcohol impairs phosphate absorption. People who excessively consume alcohol are usually also malnourished with regard to minerals. In addition, alcohol treatment is associated with refeeding, which further depletes phosphate, and the stress of alcohol withdrawal may create respiratory alkalosis, which exacerbates hypophosphatemia (see above).
* Malabsorption – This includes gastrointestinal damage, and also failure to absorb phosphate due to lack of vitamin D, or chronic use of phosphate binders such as sucralfate, aluminum-containing antacids, and (more rarely) calcium-containing antacids.
* Intravenous iron (usually for anemia) may cause hypophosphatemia. The loss of phosphate is predominantly the result of renal wasting.

Primary hypophosphatemia is the most common cause of non-nutritional rickets. Laboratory findings include low-normal serum calcium, moderately low serum phosphate, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and low serum 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D levels, hyperphosphaturia, and no evidence of hyperparathyroidism.

Hypophosphatemia decreases 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) causing a left shift in the oxyhemoglobin curve.

Other rarer causes include:
* Certain blood cancers such as lymphoma or leukemia
* Hereditary causes
* Liver failure
* Tumor-induced osteomalacia

==Pathophysiology==
Hypophosphatemia is caused by the following three mechanisms:
* Inadequate intake (often unmasked in refeeding after long-term low phosphate intake)
* Increased excretion (e.g. in hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemic rickets)
* Shift of phosphorus from the extracellular to the intracellular space. This can be seen in treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, refeeding, short-term increases in cellular demand (e.g. hungry bone syndrome) and acute respiratory alkalosis.

==Diagnosis==
Hypophosphatemia is diagnosed by measuring the concentration of phosphate in the blood. Concentrations of phosphate less than 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) are considered diagnostic of hypophosphatemia, though additional tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of the disorder.

==Treatment==
Standard intravenous preparations of potassium phosphate are available and are routinely used in malnourished people and people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol. Supplementation by mouth is also useful where no intravenous treatment are available. Historically one of the first demonstrations of this was in people in concentration camp who died soon after being re-fed: it was observed that those given milk (high in phosphate) had a higher survival rate than those who did not get milk.

Monitoring parameters during correction with IV phosphate
* Phosphorus levels should be monitored after 2 to 4 hours after each dose, also monitor serum potassium, calcium and magnesium. Cardiac monitoring is also advised.

<doc id="1059600" wikidata="Q1171033" url="?curid=1059600" title="The Burning Bed">
<text>The Burning Bed is a 1984 television drama film starring Farrah Fawcett, Paul Le Mat, and Richard Masur. Based on the 1980 non-fiction novel of the same name by Faith McNulty, it follows battered housewife Francine Hughes and her trial for the murder of her abusive husband, James Berlin &quot;Mickey&quot; Hughes. Hughes set fire to the bed her husband was sleeping in at their Dansville, Michigan home on March 9, 1977, after thirteen years of physical domestic abuse at his hands.

The film was written by Rose Leiman Goldemberg and directed by Robert Greenwald. It aired on NBC on October 8, 1984. The movie premiered with a household share of 36.2, ranking it the seventeenth highest rated movie to air on network television and NBC&#x27;s highest rated television movie.

==Plot==
On March 9, 1977, Francine Hughes and her three children arrive at the Dansville, MI, police station, where she turns herself in, after setting her husband, James Berlin “Mickey” Hughes, on fire in their home. Public defender Aryon Greydanus is appointed as Francine’s attorney and tries to gain insight into her motive. Initially reluctant, Francine recounts her life and the events leading up to the murder.

In 1964, sixteen-year-old Francine meets Mickey Hughes, and the two marry shortly after. Mickey begins displaying signs of jealousy and anger and physically abuses Francine, often in the presence of his parents. The abuse escalates over the years, and circumstances worsen with Mickey’s alcoholism. Francine divorces Mickey and takes their three young children. Mickey tries to convince Francine to get back together with him, promising he has changed his ways, but Francine refuses. After learning Mickey has been involved in a serious car crash, Francine agrees to care for him temporarily in his parents’ home; however, the situation eventually traps Francine into a domestic partnership with him. As the children get older, Francine takes business courses at a community college, much to Mickey’s disapproval. Mickey’s abuse becomes relentless, and Francine tries to leave numerous times, only for Mickey to follow her and threaten her into returning. She also seeks help from the police, family courts, and Mickey’s family, but to no avail.

As the case goes to trial, Francine testifies about the horrifying instances of abuse she suffered from Mickey over the years and what happened the day of the murder:

Francine returns home late from school, after giving a classmate a ride home, enraging a drunken Mickey. He refuses to allow her to cook TV dinners for the family and beats her. He then orders her to quit school, and when Francine refuses, he destroys her school books and forces her to burn them. Later that night, at dinner, Mickey beats her again and knocks the food on the floor. He rubs Francine’s face in the mess and orders her to quit school again. A defeated Francine agrees. Afterwards, Mickey rapes her and falls asleep in a drunken stupor. Francine goes to the garage and obtains a can of gasoline, which she pours over Mickey’s body. She takes her children to the car and drives away as the house becomes engulfed in flames. As the jury returns from deliberation, Francine is found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, and she is embraced by her children.

==Cast==
== Critical response ==
In his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall titled &quot;TV (The Book),&quot; television critic Matt Zoller Seitz named &quot;The Burning Bed&quot; as the 7th greatest American TV movie of all time, writing, &quot;The film was a landmark in terms of content, depicting domestic violence as an unambiguous horror and a human rights violation&quot;. Seitz also praised the performance of Fawcett as &quot;one of the finest in the history of TV-movies&quot;.

As of February 2025, the film is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video. 

== Accolades ==
The film was nominated for several Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Special for Farrah Fawcett, Outstanding Writing in a Limited Series or a Special, and Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special. Paul Le Mat won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Performance in a Television Film. The film won a Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Specials and a Writers Guild of America Award for Adapted Drama Anthology for Rose Leiman Goldemberg.

<text>A space capsule is a spacecraft designed to transport cargo, scientific experiments, and/or astronauts to and from space. Capsules are distinguished from other spacecraft by the ability to survive reentry and return a payload to the Earth&#x27;s surface from orbit or sub-orbit, and are distinguished from other types of recoverable spacecraft by their blunt shape, not having wings and often containing little fuel other than what is necessary for a safe return. Capsule-based crewed spacecraft such as Soyuz or Orion are often supported by a service or adapter module, and sometimes augmented with an extra module for extended space operations. Capsules make up the majority of crewed spacecraft designs, although one crewed spaceplane, the Space Shuttle, has flown in orbit.

Current examples of crewed space capsules include Soyuz, Shenzhou, and Dragon 2. Examples of new crew capsules currently in development include NASA&#x27;s Orion, Boeing&#x27;s Starliner, Russia&#x27;s Orel, India&#x27;s Gaganyaan, and China&#x27;s Mengzhou. Historic examples of crewed capsules include Vostok, Mercury, Voskhod, Gemini, and Apollo, and active programs include the New Shepard launches. A crewed space capsule must be able to sustain life in an often demanding thermal and radiation environment in the vacuum of space. It may be expendable (used once, like Soyuz) or reusable (like Crew Dragon).

==History==
===Vostok===
The Vostok was the Soviet Union&#x27;s first crewed space capsule. The first human spaceflight was Vostok 1, accomplished on April 12, 1961 by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

The capsule was originally designed for use both as a camera platform for the Soviet Union&#x27;s first spy satellite program, Zenit and as a crewed spacecraft. This dual-use design was crucial in gaining Communist Party support for the program. The design used a spherical reentry module, with a biconic descent module containing attitude control thrusters, on-orbit consumables, and the retro rocket for orbit termination. The basic design has remained in use for some 40 years, gradually adapted for a range of other uncrewed satellites.

It was a single-seat capsule that was 4.4 meters long and 2.4 meters in diameter, weighing 4.73 tonnes at launch. The reentry module was completely covered in ablative heat shield material, in diameter, weighing . The capsule was covered with a nose cone to maintain a low-drag profile for launch, with a cylindrical interior cabin approximately in diameter nearly perpendicular to the capsule&#x27;s longitudinal axis. The cosmonaut sat in an ejection seat with a separate parachute for escape during a launch emergency and landing during a normal flight. The capsule had its own parachute for landing on the ground. Although official sources stated that Gagarin had landed inside his capsule, a requirement for qualifying as a first crewed spaceflight under International Aeronautical Federation (IAF) rules, it was later revealed that all Vostok cosmonauts ejected and landed separately from the capsule. The capsule was serviced by an aft-facing conical equipment module long by , weighing containing nitrogen and oxygen breathing gasses, batteries, fuel, attitude control thrusters, and the retrorocket. It could support flights as long as ten days. Six Vostok launches were successfully conducted, the last two pairs in concurrent flights. The longest flight was just short of five days, on Vostok 5 on June 14–19, 1963.

Since the attitude control thrusters were located in the instrument module which was discarded immediately prior to reentry, the reentry module&#x27;s path and orientation could not be actively controlled. This meant that the capsule had to be protected from reentry heat on all sides, determining the spherical design (as opposed to Project Mercury&#x27;s conical design, which allowed for maximum volume while minimizing the heat shield diameter). During reentry, the heat of atmospheric friction is so great that air molecules around the capsule are ionized, creating a layer of plasma around the capsule which blocks radio communication with the ground. However, ionized gases in the plasma layer can also be used to create an artificial radio window, allowing communication signals to be transmitted and received despite the interference. Some control of the capsule&#x27;s reentry orientation was possible by offsetting its center of gravity. Proper orientation with the cosmonaut&#x27;s back to the direction of flight was necessary in order to best sustain the which also maximized the 8 to 9 g-force.

===Voskhod===
The Vostok design was modified to permit carrying multi-cosmonaut crews, and flown as two flights of the Voskhod programme. The cylindrical interior cabin was replaced with a wider, rectangular cabin which could hold either three cosmonauts seated abreast (Voskhod 1), or two cosmonauts with an inflatable airlock in between them, to permit extravehicular activity (Voskhod 2). A backup solid-fuel retro rocket was added to the top of the descent module. Vostok&#x27;s ejection seat was removed to save space (thus there was no provision for crew escape in the event of a launch or landing emergency). The complete Voskhod spacecraft weighed .

Lack of space meant that the crew members of Voskhod 1 did not wear space suits. Both Voskhod 2 crew members wore spacesuits, as it involved an EVA by cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. An airlock was needed because the vehicle&#x27;s electrical and environmental systems were air-cooled, and complete capsule depressurization would lead to overheating. The airlock weighed , was in diameter, high when collapsed for launch. When extended in orbit, it was long, had an internal diameter of and an external diameter of . The second crew member wore a spacesuit as a precaution against accidental descent module depressurization. The airlock was jettisoned after use.

The lack of ejection seats meant that the Voskhod crew would return to Earth inside their spacecraft unlike the Vostok cosmonauts who ejected and parachuted down separately. Because of this, a new landing system was developed, which added a small solid-fuel rocket to the parachute lines. It fired as the descent module neared touchdown, providing a softer landing.

===Mercury===
The Mercury program was the United States&#x27; first crewed space program. It ran from 1958 through 1963, with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth and returning him safely. The program used a small capsule attached to a booster rocket to achieve orbit. The development of the Mercury capsule began in earnest after NASA selected the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation as its contractor in 1959. The Mercury spacecraft&#x27;s principal designer was Maxime Faget, who started research for human spaceflight during the time of the NACA. It was long and wide; with the launch escape system added, the overall length was . With of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for a single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The heaviest spacecraft, Mercury-Atlas 9, weighed fully loaded. Its outer skin was made of René 41, a nickel alloy able to withstand high temperatures.

The spacecraft was cone shaped, with a neck at the narrow end. It had a convex base, which carried a heat shield (Item 2 in the diagram below) consisting of an aluminum honeycomb covered with multiple layers of fiberglass. Strapped to it was a retropack (1) consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry. Between these were three minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion. The straps that held the package could be severed when it was no longer needed. Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment (3). Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments in front of him and with his back to the heat shield. Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat, scrubbing the air of CO2, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine. The recovery compartment (4) at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: a drogue to stabilize free fall and two main chutes, a primary and reserve. Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing. On top of the recovery compartment was the antenna section (5) containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation. Attached was a flap used to ensure the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry. A launch escape system (6) was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule&#x27;s parachute for a landing nearby at sea. (See also Mission profile for details.)

The Mercury spacecraft did not have an on-board computer, instead relying on all computation for reentry to be calculated by computers on the ground, with their results (retrofire times and firing attitude) then transmitted to the spacecraft by radio while in flight. All computer systems used in the Mercury space program were housed in NASA facilities on Earth. The computer systems were IBM 701 computers.

The US launched its first Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight almost a month after the first crewed orbital spaceflight. The Soviets were able to launch a second Vostok on a one-day flight on August 6, before the US finally orbited the first American, John Glenn, on February 20, 1962. The United States launched a total of two crewed suborbital Mercury capsules and four crewed orbital capsules, with the longest flight, Mercury-Atlas 9, making 22 orbits and lasting 32 and one-half hours.

=== Gemini===
Many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design made it easy to repair. The Gemini spacecraft was the precursor to the Apollo program which aimed to land humans on the Moon. It was designed to test new techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking, but it also featured improvements in life support systems, spacecraft reentry, and other critical areas.

Gemini&#x27;s emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the Titan II&#x27;s hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return to Earth inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.

The main proponent of using ejection seats was Chamberlin, who had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats.

Maxime Faget, the designer of the Mercury LES, was on the other hand less-than-enthusiastic about this setup. Aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts, they would also only be usable for about 40 seconds after liftoff, by which point the booster would be attaining Mach 1 speed and ejection would no longer be possible. He was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the Titan&#x27;s exhaust plume if they ejected in-flight and later added, &quot;The best thing about Gemini was that they never had to make an escape.&quot;

The Gemini ejection system was never tested with the Gemini cabin pressurized with pure oxygen, as it was prior to launch. In January 1967, the fatal Apollo 1 fire demonstrated that pressurizing a spacecraft with pure oxygen created an extremely dangerous fire hazard. In a 1997 oral history, astronaut Thomas P. Stafford commented on the Gemini 6 launch abort in December 1965, when he and command pilot Wally Schirra nearly ejected from the spacecraft:

Gemini was the first astronaut-carrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer, the Gemini Guidance Computer, to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers. This computer, sometimes called the Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer (OBC), was very similar to the Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer. The Gemini Guidance Computer weighed . Its core memory had 4096 addresses, each containing a 39-bit word composed of three 13-bit &quot;syllables&quot;. All numeric data was 26-bit two&#x27;s-complement integers (sometimes used as fixed-point numbers), either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator. Instructions (always with a 4-bit opcode and 9 bits of operand) could go in any syllable.

===Apollo===


The Apollo spacecraft was first conceived in 1960 as a three-man craft to follow Project Mercury, to accomplish several types of mission: ferrying astronauts to an Earth-orbiting space station, circumlunar flight, or a Moon landing. NASA solicited feasibility study designs from several companies in 1960 and 1961, while Faget and the Space Task Group worked on their own design using a conical/blunt-body capsule (Command Module) supported by a cylindrical Service Module providing electrical power and propulsion. NASA reviewed the entrants&#x27; designs in May 1961, but when President John F. Kennedy proposed a national effort to land a man on the Moon during the 1960s, NASA decided to reject the feasibility studies and proceed with Faget&#x27;s design, focused on the lunar landing mission. The contract to build Apollo was awarded to North American Aviation.

The main Apollo spacecraft was built in two segments: a Command Module (CM) and a Service Module (SM). The CM was in diameter and high, with a mass of at launch. The Service Module was long, with a total Command/Service Module (CSM) vehicle length of including the engine bell. The hypergolic propellant service propulsion engine was sized at to lift the CSM off the lunar surface and send it back to Earth using a direct ascent mission profile. This required a single-launch vehicle much larger than the Saturn V, or else multiple Saturn V launches to assemble it in Earth orbit before sending it to the Moon.

Early on, the direct ascent mission profile was replaced with lunar orbit rendezvous, augmenting the CSM with the Lunar Excursion Module (LM) to ferry two astronauts to the lunar surface. This reduced the net spacecraft mass, allowing the mission to be launched with a single Saturn V. Since significant development work had started on the design, it was decided to continue with the existing design as Block I, while a Block II version capable of rendezvous with the LEM would be developed in parallel. Besides addition of a docking tunnel and probe, Block II would employ equipment improvements based on lessons learned from the Block I design. Block I would be used for uncrewed test flights and a limited number of Earth orbit crewed flights. Though the service propulsion engine was now bigger than required, its design was not changed since significant development was already in progress; however, the propellant tanks were downsized slightly to reflect the modified fuel requirement. Based on astronaut preference, the Block II CM would replace the two-piece plug door hatch cover, chosen to avoid an accidental hatch opening such as had happened on Gus Grissom&#x27;s Mercury-Redstone 4 flight, with a one-piece, outward-opening hatch to make egress easier at the end of the mission.

The Mercury-Gemini practice of using a prelaunch atmosphere of pure oxygen proved to be disastrous in combination with the plug-door hatch design. While participating in a pre-launch test on the pad on January 27, 1967, in preparation for the first crewed launch in February, the entire crew of Apollo 1—Grissom, Edward H. White, and Roger Chaffee—were killed in a fire that swept through the cabin. The plug door made it impossible for the astronauts to escape or be removed before their deaths. An investigation revealed the fire was probably started by a spark from a frayed wire, and fed by combustible materials that should not have been in the cabin. The crewed flight program was delayed while design changes were made to the Block II spacecraft to replace the pure oxygen pre-launch atmosphere with an air-like nitrogen/oxygen mixture, eliminate combustible materials from the cabin and the astronauts&#x27; space suits, and seal all electrical wiring and corrosive coolant lines.

The Block II spacecraft weighed fully fueled, and was used in four crewed Earth and lunar orbital test flights, and seven crewed lunar landing missions. A modified version of the spacecraft was also used to ferry three crews to the Skylab space station, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission which docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. The Apollo spacecraft was retired after 1974.

==Active space capsules==
===Soyuz===
In 1963, Korolev first proposed the three-man Soyuz spacecraft for use in Earth orbit assembly of a lunar exploration mission. He was pressured by Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev to postpone development of Soyuz to work on Voskhod, and later allowed to develop Soyuz for space station and lunar exploration missions.
He employed a small, lightweight bell-shaped reentry capsule, with an orbital crew module attached to its nose, containing the bulk of the mission living space. The service module would use two panels of electric solar cells for power generation, and contained a propulsion system engine. The 7K-OK model designed for Earth orbit used a reentry module measuring in diameter by long, with an interior volume of . The spheroidal orbital module measured in diameter by long with a docking probe, with an interior volume of . The total spacecraft mass was .

Ten of these craft flew crewed after Korolev&#x27;s death, from 1967 to 1971. The first (Soyuz 1) and last (Soyuz 11) resulted in the first in-space fatalities. Korolev had developed a 7K-LOK variant for use in the lunar mission, but this was never flown crewed.

The Russians continued to develop and fly the Soyuz to this day.

===Shenzhou===
Space capsules have also been used for scientific research and experimentation in space. For example, the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft has carried out experiments in life sciences, material sciences, fluid dynamics, and space environment monitoring. The PRC developed its &quot;Shenzhou&quot; spacecraft in the 1990s based on the same concept (orbital, reentry and service modules) as Soyuz. Its first uncrewed test flight was in 1999, and the first crewed flight in October 2003 carried Yang Liwei for 14 Earth orbits.

===Dragon 2===

The SpaceX Dragon 2 capsule first launched crew to the International Space Station on 30 May 2020 on the Demo-2 mission for NASA. Although originally envisaged as a development of SpaceX&#x27;s uncrewed Dragon capsule which was used for the NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract, the demands of crewed spaceflight resulted in a significantly redesigned vehicle with limited commonality. The Dragon capsule was designed to be reusable. In fact, SpaceX has flown the same Dragon capsule to the International Space Station multiple times, with the first successful reuse occurring in June 2017.

===New Shepard Crew Capsule===
The six-seat Blue Origin developed New Shepard crew capsule is a suborbital crewed spacecraft designed for human tended research and space tourism. The capsule can also fly uncrewed, carrying payloads and experiments.

<text>An old-growth forest or primary forest is a forest that has developed over a long period of time without disturbance. Due to this, old-growth forests exhibit unique ecological features. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines primary forests as naturally regenerated forests of native tree species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activity and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed. One-third (34 percent) of the world&#x27;s forests are primary forests. Old-growth features include diverse tree-related structures that provide diverse wildlife habitats that increases the biodiversity of the forested ecosystem. Virgin or first-growth forests are old-growth forests that have never been logged. The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps, greatly varying tree heights and diameters, and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris., the world has of primary forest remaining. Combined, three countries (Brazil, Canada, and Russia) host more than half (61 percent) of the world&#x27;s primary forest. The area of primary forest has decreased by since 1990, but the rate of loss more than halved in 2010–2020 compared with the previous decade.

Old-growth forests are valuable for economic reasons and for the ecosystem services they provide. This can be a point of contention when some in the logging industry desire to harvest valuable timber from the forests, destroying the forests in the process, to generate short-term profits, while environmentalists seek to preserve the forests in their pristine state for benefits such as water purification, flood control, weather stability, maintenance of biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. Moreover, old-growth forests are more efficient at sequestering carbon than newly planted forests and fast-growing timber plantations, thus preserving the forests is vital to climate change mitigation.

== Characteristics ==

Old-growth forests tend to have large trees and standing dead trees, multilayered canopies with gaps that result from the deaths of individual trees, and coarse woody debris on the forest floor. The trees of old-growth forests develop distinctive attributes not seen in younger trees, such as more complex structures and deeply fissured bark that can harbor rare lichens and mosses.

A forest regenerated after a severe disturbance, such as wildfire, insect infestation, or harvesting, is often called second-growth or &#x27;regeneration&#x27; until enough time passes for the effects of the disturbance to be no longer evident. Depending on the forest, this may take from a century to several millennia. Hardwood forests of the eastern United States can develop old-growth characteristics in 150–500 years. In British Columbia, Canada, old growth is defined as 120 to 140 years of age in the interior of the province where fire is a frequent and natural occurrence. In British Columbia&#x27;s coastal rainforests, old growth is defined as trees more than 250 years, with some trees reaching more than 1,000 years of age. In Australia, eucalypt trees rarely exceed 350 years of age due to frequent fire disturbance.

Forest types have very different development patterns, natural disturbances and appearances. A Douglas-fir stand may grow for centuries without disturbance while an old-growth ponderosa pine forest requires frequent surface fires to reduce the shade-tolerant species and regenerate the canopy species. In the boreal forest of Canada, catastrophic disturbances like wildfires minimize opportunities for major accumulations of dead and downed woody material and other structural legacies associated with old growth conditions. Typical characteristics of old-growth forest include the presence of older trees, minimal signs of human disturbance, mixed-age stands, presence of canopy openings due to tree falls, pit-and-mound topography, down wood in various stages of decay, standing snags (dead trees), multilayered canopies, intact soils, a healthy fungal ecosystem, and presence of indicator species.

=== Biodiversity ===
Old-growth forests are often biologically diverse, and home to many rare species, threatened species, and endangered species of plants and animals, such as the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet and fisher, making them ecologically significant. Levels of biodiversity may be higher or lower in old-growth forests compared to that in second-growth forests, depending on specific circumstances, environmental variables, and geographic variables. Logging in old-growth forests is a contentious issue in many parts of the world. Excessive logging reduces biodiversity, affecting not only the old-growth forest itself, but also indigenous species that rely upon old-growth forest habitat.

Studies in British Columbia&#x27;s cedar-hemlock forests have shown that certain lichen species, particularly cyanolichens, are almost exclusively found in old-growth forests, being absent from even-aged stands (where all trees grew after a single disturbance event) of the same age (120–140 years). This suggests that true old-growth characteristics, like diverse forest structure and microclimate conditions, are necessary for some specialist species beyond just forest age.

=== Mixed age ===
Some forests in the old-growth stage have a mix of tree ages, due to a distinct regeneration pattern for this stage. New trees regenerate at different times from each other, because each of them has a different spatial location relative to the main canopy, hence each one receives a different amount of light. The mixed age of the forest is an important criterion in ensuring that the forest is a relatively stable ecosystem in the long term. A climax stand that is uniformly aged becomes senescent and degrades within a relatively short time to result in a new cycle of forest succession. Thus, uniformly aged stands are less stable ecosystems. Boreal forests are more uniformly aged, as they are normally subject to frequent stand-replacing wildfires.

=== Canopy openings ===
Forest canopy gaps are essential in creating and maintaining mixed-age stands. Also, some herbaceous plants only become established in canopy openings, but persist beneath an understory. Openings are a result of tree death due to small impact disturbances such as wind, low-intensity fires, and tree diseases.

Old-growth forests are unique, usually having multiple horizontal layers of vegetation representing a variety of tree species, age classes, and sizes, as well as &quot;pit and mound&quot; soil shape with well-established fungal nets. As old-growth forest is structurally diverse, it provides higher-diversity habitat than forests in other stages. Thus, sometimes higher biological diversity can be sustained in old-growth forests, or at least a biodiversity that is different from other forest stages.

=== Topography ===
The characteristic topography of much old-growth forest consists of pits and mounds. Mounds are caused by decaying fallen trees, and pits (tree throws) by the roots pulled out of the ground when trees fall due to natural causes, including being pushed over by animals. Pits expose humus-poor, mineral-rich soil and often collect moisture and fallen leaves, forming a thick organic layer that is able to nurture certain types of organisms. Mounds provide a place free of leaf inundation and saturation, where other types of organisms thrive.

=== Standing snags ===
Standing snags provide food sources and habitat for many types of organisms. In particular, many species of dead-wood predators, such as woodpeckers, must have standing snags available for feeding. In North America, the spotted owl is well known for needing standing snags for nesting habitat.

=== Decaying ground layer ===

Fallen timber, or coarse woody debris, contributes carbon-rich organic matter directly to the soil, providing a substrate for mosses, fungi, and seedlings, and creating microhabitats by creating relief on the forest floor. In some ecosystems such as the temperate rain forest of the North American Pacific coast, fallen timber may become nurse logs, providing a substrate for seedling trees.

=== Soil ===
Intact soils harbor many life forms that rely on them. Intact soils generally have very well-defined horizons, or soil profiles. Different organisms may need certain well-defined soil horizons to live, while many trees need well-structured soils free of disturbance to thrive. Some herbaceous plants in northern hardwood forests must have thick duff layers (which are part of the soil profile). Fungal ecosystems are essential for efficient &quot;in-situ&quot; recycling of nutrients back into the entire ecosystem.

== Definitions ==

=== Ecological definitions ===

==== Stand age definition ====
Stand age can also be used to categorize a forest as old-growth. For any given geographical area, the average time since disturbance until a forest reaches the old growth stage can be determined. This method is useful, because it allows quick and objective determination of forest stage. However, this definition does not provide an explanation of forest function. It just gives a useful number to measure. So, some forests may be excluded from being categorized as old-growth even if they have old-growth attributes just because they are too young. Also, older forests can lack some old-growth attributes and be categorized as old-growth just because they are so old. The idea of using age is also problematic, because human activities can influence the forest in varied ways. For example, after the logging of 30% of the trees, less time is needed for old-growth to come back than after removal of 80% of the trees. Although depending on the species logged, the forest that comes back after a 30% harvest may consist of proportionately fewer hardwood trees than a forest logged at 80% in which the light competition by less important tree species does not inhibit the regrowth of vital hardwoods.

==== Forest dynamics definition ====
From a forest dynamics perspective, old-growth forest is in a stage that follows understory reinitiation stage. Those stages are:

# Stand-replacing: Disturbance hits the forest and kills most of the living trees.
# Stand-initiation: A population of new trees becomes established.
# Stem-exclusion: Trees grow higher and enlarge their canopy, thus competing for the light with neighbors; light competition mortality kills slow-growing trees and reduces forest density, which allows surviving trees to increase in size. Eventually, the canopies of neighboring trees touch each other and drastically lower the amount of light that reaches lower layers. Due to that, the understory dies and only very shade-tolerant species survive.
# Understory reinitiation: Trees die from low-level mortality, such as windthrow and diseases. Individual canopy gaps start to appear and more light can reach the forest floor. Hence, shade-tolerant species can establish in the understory.
# Old-growth: Main canopy trees become older and more of them die, creating even more gaps. Since the gaps appear at different times, the understory trees are at different growth stages. Furthermore, the amount of light that reaches each understory tree depends on its position relative to the gap. Thus, each understory tree grows at a different rate. The differences in establishment timing and in growth rate create a population of understory trees that is variable in size. Eventually, some understory trees grow to become as tall as the main canopy trees, thereby filling the gap. This perpetuation process is typical for the old-growth stage. This, however, does not mean that the forest will be old-growth forever. Generally, three futures for old-growth stage forest are possible: 1) The forest will be hit by a disturbance and most of the trees will die, 2) Unfavorable conditions for new trees to regenerate will occur. In this case, the old trees will die and smaller plants will create woodland, and 3) The regenerating understory trees are different species from the main canopy trees. In this case, the forest will switch back to stem-exclusion stage, but with shade-tolerant tree species. 4) The forest in an old-growth stage can be stable for centuries, but the length of this stage depends on the forest&#x27;s tree composition and the climate of the area. For example, frequent natural fires do not allow boreal forests to be as old as coastal forests of western North America.

Of importance is that while the stand switches from one tree community to another, the stand will not necessarily go through old-growth stage between those stages. Some tree species have a relatively open canopy. That allows more shade-tolerant tree species to establish below even before the understory reinitiation stage. The shade-tolerant trees eventually outcompete the main canopy trees in stem-exclusion stage. Therefore, the dominant tree species will change, but the forest will still be in stem-exclusion stage until the shade-tolerant species reach old-growth stage.

Tree species succession may change tree species&#x27; composition once the old-growth stage has been achieved. For example, an old boreal forest may contain some large aspen trees, which may die and be replaced by smaller balsam fir or black spruce. Consequently, the forest will switch back to understory reinitiation stage. Using the stand dynamics definition, old-growth can be easily evaluated using structural attributes. However, in some forest ecosystems, this can lead to decisions regarding the preservation of unique stands or attributes that will disappear over the next few decades because of natural succession processes. Consequently, using stand dynamics to define old-growth forests is more accurate in forests where the species that constitute old-growth have long lifespans and succession is slow.

=== Social and cultural definitions ===
Common cultural definitions and common denominators regarding what comprises old-growth forest, and the variables that define, constitute and embody old-growth forests include:
* The forest habitat possesses relatively mature, old trees;
* The tree species present have long continuity on the same site;
* The forest itself is a remnant natural area that has not been subjected to significant disturbance by mankind, altering the appearance of the landscape and its ecosystems, has not been subjected to logging (or other types of development such as road networks or housing), and has inherently progressed per natural tendencies.

Additionally, in mountainous, temperate landscapes (such as Western North America), and specifically in areas of high-quality soil and a moist, relatively mild climate, some old-growth trees have attained notable height and girth (DBH: diameter at breast height), accompanied by notable biodiversity in terms of the species supported. Therefore, for most people, the physical size of the trees is the most recognized hallmark of old-growth forests, even though the ecologically productive areas that support such large trees often comprise only a very small portion of the total area that has been mapped as old-growth forest. (In high-altitude, harsh climates, trees grow very slowly and thus remain at a small size. Such trees also qualify as old growth in terms of how they are mapped, but are rarely recognized by the general public as such.)

The debate over old-growth definitions has been inextricably linked with a complex range of social perceptions about wilderness preservation, biodiversity, aesthetics, and spirituality, as well as economic or industrial values.

=== Economic definitions ===
In logging terms, old-growth stands are past the economic optimum for harvestingusually between 80 and 150 years, depending on the species. Old-growth forests were often given harvesting priority because they had the most commercially valuable timber, they were considered to be at greater risk of deterioration through root rot or insect infestation, and they occupied land that could be used for more productive second-growth stands. In some regions, old growth is not the most commercially viable timberin British Columbia, Canada, harvesting in the coastal region is moving to younger second-growth stands.

=== Other definitions ===
A 2001 scientific symposium in Canada found that defining old growth in a scientifically meaningful, yet policy-relevant, manner presents some basic difficulties, especially if a simple, unambiguous, and rigorous scientific definition is sought. Symposium participants identified some attributes of late-successional, temperate-zone, old-growth forest types that could be considered in developing an index of &quot;old-growthness&quot; and for defining old-growth forests:

Structural features:

* Uneven or multi-aged stand structure, or several identifiable age cohorts
* Average age of dominant species approaching half the maximum longevity for species (about 150+ years for most shade-tolerant trees)
* Some old trees at close to their maximum longevity (ages of 300+ years)
* Presence of standing dead and dying trees in various stages of decay
* Fallen, coarse woody debris
* Natural regeneration of dominant tree species within canopy gaps or on decaying logs

Compositional features:
* Long-lived, shade-tolerant tree species associations (e.g., sugar maple, American beech, yellow birch, red spruce, eastern hemlock, white pine)

Process features:
* Characterized by small-scale disturbances creating gaps in the forest canopy
* A long natural rotation for catastrophic or stand-replacing disturbance (e.g., a period greater than the maximum longevity of the dominant tree species)
* Minimal evidence of human disturbance
* Final stages of stand development before a relatively steady state is reached

== Importance ==

* Old-growth forests often contain rich communities of plants and animals within the habitat due to the long period of forest stability. These varied and sometimes rare species may depend on the unique environmental conditions created by these forests.
* Old-growth forests serve as a reservoir for species, which cannot thrive or easily regenerate in younger forests, so they can be used as a baseline for research.
* Plant species that are native to old-growth forests may someday prove to be invaluable towards curing various human ailments, as has been realized in numerous plants in tropical rainforests.
* Old-growth forests also store large amounts of carbon above and below the ground (either as humus, or in wet soils as peat). They collectively represent a very significant store of carbon. Destruction of these forests releases this carbon as greenhouse gases, and may increase the risk of global climate change. Although old-growth forests serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that aging forests cease to accumulate carbon. However, in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity (the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive; old-growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and contain large quantities of it.

== Ecosystem services ==
Old-growth forests provide ecosystem services that may be far more important to society than their use as a source of raw materials. These services include making breathable air, making pure water, carbon storage, regeneration of nutrients, maintenance of soils, pest control by insectivorous bats and insects, micro- and macro-climate control, and the storage of a wide variety of genes.

== Climatic impacts ==
The effects of old-growth forests in relation to global warming have been addressed in various studies and journals.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its 2007 report: &quot;In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre, or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.&quot;

Old-growth forests are often perceived to be in equilibrium or in a state of decay. However, evidence from analysis of carbon stored above ground and in the soil has shown old-growth forests are more productive at storing carbon than younger forests. Forest harvesting has little or no effect on the amount of carbon stored in the soil, but other research suggests older forests that have trees of many ages, multiple layers, and little disturbance have the highest capacities for carbon storage. As trees grow, they remove carbon from the atmosphere, and protecting these pools of carbon prevents emissions into the atmosphere. Proponents of harvesting the forest argue the carbon stored in wood is available for use as biomass energy (displacing fossil fuel use), although using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulates, and other pollutants, in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas.

Each forest has a different potential to store carbon. For example, this potential is particularly high in the Pacific Northwest where forests are relatively productive, trees live a long time, decomposition is relatively slow, and fires are infrequent. The differences between forests must, therefore, be taken into consideration when determining how they should be managed to store carbon. A 2019 study projected that old-growth forests in Southeast Asia, the majority of which are in Indonesia and Malaysia, are able to sequester carbon or be a net emitter of greenhouse gases based on deforestation scenarios over the subsequent decades.

Old-growth forests have the potential to impact climate change, but climate change is also impacting old-growth forests. As the effects of global warming grow more substantial, the ability of old-growth forests to sequester carbon is affected. Climate change showed an impact on the mortality of some dominant tree species, as observed in the Korean pine. Climate change also showed an effect on the composition of species when forests were surveyed over a 10- and 20-year period, which may disrupt the overall productivity of the forest.

== Logging ==

According to the World Resources Institute, as of January 2009, only 21% of the original old-growth forests that once existed on Earth are remaining. An estimated one-half of Western Europe&#x27;s forests were cleared before the Middle Ages, and 90% of the old-growth forests that existed in the contiguous United States in the 1600s have been cleared.

The large trees in old-growth forests are economically valuable, and have been subject to aggressive logging throughout the world. This has led to many conflicts between logging companies and environmental groups. From certain forestry perspectives, fully maintaining an old-growth forest is seen as extremely economically unproductive, as timber can only be collected from falling trees, and also potentially damaging to nearby managed groves by creating environments conducive to root rot. It may be more productive to cut the old growth down and replace the forest with a younger one.

The island of Tasmania, just off the southeast coast of Australia, has the largest amount of temperate old-growth rainforest reserves in Australia with around 1,239,000 hectares in total. While the local Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) was originally designed to protect much of this natural wealth, many of the RFA old-growth forests protected in Tasmania consist of trees of little use to the timber industry. RFA old-growth and high conservation value forests that contain species highly desirable to the forestry industry have been poorly preserved. Only 22% of Tasmania&#x27;s original tall-eucalypt forests managed by Forestry Tasmania have been reserved. Ten thousand hectares of tall-eucalypt RFA old-growth forest have been lost since 1996, predominantly as a result of industrial logging operations. In 2006, about 61,000 hectares of tall-eucalypt RFA old-growth forests remained unprotected. Recent logging attempts in the Upper Florentine Valley have sparked a series of protests and media attention over the arrests that have taken place in this area. Additionally, Gunns Limited, the primary forestry contractor in Tasmania, has been under recent criticism by political and environmental groups over its practice of woodchipping timber harvested from old-growth forests.

== Management ==
Increased understanding of forest dynamics in the late 20th century led the scientific community to identify a need to inventory, understand, manage, and conserve representative examples of old-growth forests with their associated characteristics and values. Literature around old growth and its management is inconclusive about the best way to characterize the true essence of an old-growth stand.

A better understanding of natural systems has resulted in new ideas about forest management, such as managed natural disturbances, which should be designed to achieve the landscape patterns and habitat conditions normally maintained in nature. This coarse filter approach to biodiversity conservation recognizes ecological processes and provides for a dynamic distribution of old growth across the landscape.
And all seral stagesyoung, medium, and oldsupport forest biodiversity. Plants and animals rely on different forest ecosystem stages to meet their habitat needs.

In Australia, the Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) attempted to prevent the clearfelling of defined &quot;old-growth forests&quot;. This led to struggles over what constitutes &quot;old growth&quot;. For example, in Western Australia, the timber industry tried to limit the area of old growth in the karri forests of the Southern Forests Region; this led to the creation of the Western Australian Forests Alliance, the splitting of the Liberal Government of Western Australia and the election of the Gallop Labor Government. Old-growth forests in this region have now been placed inside national parks. A small proportion of old-growth forests also exist in South-West Australia and are protected by federal laws from logging, which has not occurred there for more than 20 years.

In British Columbia, Canada, old-growth forests must be maintained in each of the province&#x27;s ecological units to meet biodiversity needs.

In the United States, from 2001, around a quarter of the federal forests are protected from logging. In December 2023, Biden&#x27;s administration introduced a rule, according to which, logging is strongly limited in old growth forests, but permitted in &quot;mature forests&quot;, representing a compromise between the logging industry and environmental activists.

== Locations of remaining tracts ==
In 2006, Greenpeace identified that the world&#x27;s remaining intact forest landscapes are distributed among the continents as follows:
* 35% in South America: The Amazon rainforest is mainly located in Brazil, which clears a larger area of forest annually than any other country in the world.
* 28% in North America, which harvests of ancient forests every year. Many of the fragmented forests of southern Canada and the United States lack adequate animal travel corridors and functioning ecosystems for large mammals. Most of the remaining old-growth forests in the contiguous United States and Alaska are on public land.
* 19% in northern Asia, home to the largest boreal forest in the world
* 8% in Africa, which has lost most of its intact forest landscapes in the last 30 years. The timber industry and local governments are responsible for destroying huge areas of intact forest landscapes and continue to be the single largest threat to these areas.
* 7% in South Asia Pacific, where the Paradise Forests are being destroyed faster than any other forest on Earth. Much of the large, intact forest landscapes have already been cut down, 72% in Indonesia, and 60% in Papua New Guinea.
* Less than 3% in Europe, where more than of intact forest landscapes are cleared every year and the last areas of the region&#x27;s intact forest landscapes in European Russia are shrinking rapidly. In the United Kingdom, they are known as ancient woodlands.

<text>The is a series of V6-engined executive cars that was produced by Honda between 1985 and 2021, and served as its flagship vehicle. The Legend has also been sold under the Acura Legend, RL and RLX nameplates — the successive flagship vehicles of Honda&#x27;s luxury Acura division in North America from 1986 until 2020.

==First generation (KA1–6; 1985)==


The first-generation Legend, introduced to Japan on October 22, 1985, was the first production Honda vehicle to offer only a SOHC V6 engine worldwide. The introduction of the Legend also coincided with the launch of a new dealership sales channel in Japan, called &quot;Honda Clio&quot;. The Legend was the result of a joint venture with Britain&#x27;s Austin Rover Group called Project XX that started in November 1981 with the Austin Rover-Honda XX letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the Rover SD1 and to provide a luxury vehicle for Honda, and was codenamed as HX. The Rover Company had a long-established reputation as a luxury car maker in the United Kingdom and Europe, demonstrated by the Rover P5 and Rover P6, and Honda wanted to introduce a luxury car for the Japanese, European and North American markets. Rover also wanted to return to the American market when previously they had reportedly sold only 1,500 cars in 1971, and a brief return in 1980, selling 800 Rover SD1s by offering the Sterling which was also a result of the ARG-Honda partnership. The development work was carried out at Rover&#x27;s Canley, Coventry plant and Honda&#x27;s Tochigi Prefecture development centre. Design work concluded on the Legend in 1982, with a design patent being filed on September 27, 1982, at the Japan Patent Office under application number 1982-043493 and registered on September 19, 1984, under patent number 0640105.

Honda and British Leyland/Rover agreed that Legends would be built at Cowley for the British market. However, few UK built Legends passed Honda&#x27;s quality control standards, and many simply ended up being used as in-plant transport. In the end, only 4,409 Legends were built in the UK, from 1986 until 1988. All US-market Legends were built in Japan.

===Japanese market===
Honda wanted to expand its model range above the Honda Accord, and offer a premium level sedan that would appeal to wealthy middle-aged customers who were the traditional buyers of the Toyota Crown, Mazda Luce and Nissan Cedric/Gloria. In 1981, Honda had introduced a luxury level version of the Accord, called the Honda Vigor, but realized that they needed to manufacture a larger, more exclusive sedan with similar dimensions to the Crown, Luce, Cedric and Gloria. When the Legend was introduced worldwide, the optional equipment list was minimal as commonly identified equipment regarded as luxury in nature was included as standard equipment, leaving the only option the choice between a manual or automatic transmission.

The major mechanical difference between the Legend and the Toyota, Mazda and Nissan sedans was that the Legend was front-wheel drive, which Honda stated was &quot;quite simply the most logical means to the ends the engineers desired: a true luxury car with a low, aerodynamic hood; a spacious interior with a nearly flat floor, and the superior traction that results from placing the engine and drivetrain transversely over the drive wheels.&quot; This provided the Legend with a front-end heavy 63/37 front to rear weight distribution ratio, similar to the NSU Ro 80. The ride was engineered to appeal towards the luxury car market and not necessarily towards the performance market, and the front to rear weight distribution ratio reflected this goal. Efforts to minimize torque steer were achieved by the half shafts and the angles of the joints at the ends of those shafts being equalized, helping the Legend to accelerate in a straight line.

The Japanese-spec Legend was offered in three trim levels; the V6Xi with the 2.5 L C25A V6 engine, with the slightly shorter and narrower V6Gi and V6Zi using the 2.0 L C20A V6. The V6Gi had the same level of equipment and luxury features as the V6Xi, whereas the V6Zi had reduced content and a lower price. The V6 engines were available with electronic, multi-port sequential fuel injection Honda called Programmed Fuel Injection, or PGM-FI and a variable length intake manifold on the smaller 2.0-liter V6. The larger 2.5 engine was upgraded to the C27A 2.7 liters of displacement for model year 1988 and added a variable length intake manifold. The engine benefited from Honda&#x27;s successes with its endeavors in Formula One racing in 1964, and Honda&#x27;s F1 racing car, the Honda RA271. Transmission selections were either a four-speed automatic transaxle with a computer controlled lockup torque converter, or a five-speed manual transaxle.

In order for the sedan to comply with Japanese vehicle size requirements and reduced tax liability, the car with the 2.0 L V6 was slightly shorter and narrower for Japanese buyers by reducing the extension of the front and rear bumper covers, and reducing the overall width to . This also offered an alternative to the traditional Crown and Cedric/Gloria customer base due to the sedan being in the smaller size classification and reduced tax liability but with a comparable level of luxury equipment found in the larger cars, and the same amount of interior space due to the front-wheel drive powertrain, with a wheelbase advantage of over the Cedric/Gloria and Crown. To address the issue of durability, the Legend was manufactured as a pillared sedan instead of a four-door hardtop, a body style still offered at the time by Toyota and Nissan on the Crown and Cedric/Gloria. The slightly smaller body style also allowed the Legend to compete with the upscale Toyota Cresta and Chaser and the Nissan Laurel.

The Legend offered many Honda &quot;firsts&quot;, such as a driver side airbag, vehicle speed sensitive power assist rack and pinon steering, anti-lock brakes, seat belt pre-tensioners with Emergency Locking Retractors (called E.L.R.), a choice of 100% wool or cloth moquette upholstery, and &quot;TCS&quot; Traction control, the first car to use traction control on a front-wheel drive vehicle. Attention was given to make sure the Legend was quiet, so Honda used computer simulation using NASTRAN, a stress analysis program created by NASA, helping the car achieve a drag coefficient of 0.32 and an interior noise level of 63 dB (measured while the vehicle was travelling at using a manual transmission in 5th gear), and by using triple seals around the tops of door openings.

The Legend was introduced with a double wishbone suspension for the front wheels, and a modified Chapman strut with trailing arm rear suspension Honda called &quot;RF (Reduced Friction) Strut Rear Suspension&quot; with progressive rate rear coil springs that stiffen as they compress to combine smooth ride and good handling. The rear coil spring was separate from the strut and positioned so that vertical pressure was supported by the lower control arm. The term Reduced Friction referred to the minimizing of forces that create friction in the shock absorbers, providing more efficient damping for the full suspension stroke. The rear suspension was upgraded to double wishbone starting with the 1988 model year worldwide.

Notable owners of the first generation Legend were Soichiro Honda the founder of Honda, Satoru Nakajima, Tyrrell Racing F1 driver in 1990, and Ayrton Senna. The Legend V6Xi was used as the pace car for the Suzuka Circuit for 1986.

====&quot;Wing Turbo&quot; version====
In October 1988, Honda upgraded the C20A V6 engine used exclusively in the KA5 series Legend with a variable geometry turbocharger, calling it the &quot;Wing Turbo&quot; in a Japanese TV commercial to address the modest power available from the previous engine with variable length intake manifold used in earlier models. The turbocharger compressor housing had four vanes made from heat resistant Inconel alloy surrounding the turbine wheel (on the inlet side of it) that would fluctuate based on engine load and transmission gearing above 2,000 rpm to allow for increased airflow into the engine as needed. The turbo compressor could generate as much as of boost, and was paired with a water cooled intercooler installed inside the intake plenum between the cylinder banks to produce net at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3,500 rpm. The turbo was installed not necessarily to make the engine more powerful, but rather to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, as the Japanese pay a tax on the amount of emissions the car produces.

According to an excerpt of &quot;Automotive Engineering&quot; in January 1989, &quot;The movable wings are positive pressure- and vacuum-operated, their angle changes are controlled by an eight-bit 36-kilobyte computer that also manages fuel injection. Positive pressure to the wing actuator is supplied by the turbo&#x27;s supercharge pressure, controlled by a frequency solenoid valve, and negative pressure is generated by intake vacuum and accumulated in a reservoir which is also solenoid controlled. The CPU is fed signals including boost pressure, intake temperature, coolant temperature, throttle opening, engine rpm, and vehicle speed. The Wing Turbo is not fitted with a conventional wastegate.

On idling and steady-state cruising that do not require supercharging, the movable flags—or wings—which are fully opened, allow exhaust gas to enter the enlarged nozzle area and pass through the turbine smoothly with little resistance. At the beginning of full acceleration, the wings close fully, reducing the nozzle area through which accelerated gas enters and strikes the turbine blades forcefully, gaining boost quickly. When maximum boost is obtained, the movable wings begin to close gradually, until the vehicle reaches a desired cruising velocity whereby the wings open fully. The nozzle area varies continuously according to operating and load conditions.&quot;

The turbo was installed just above the automatic transmission unit; a manual transmission was not offered. This engine was only offered in Japan using the more compact sedan body style, labeled as &quot;2.0 Ti Exclusive&quot; and &quot;2.0 Ti&quot;. The engine was used for just two years, due to the introduction of the second generation Legend in 1990 with the much larger C32A V6, and as such Wing Turbo sedans are extremely rare. Much of the research on this engine contributed to the VTEC C30A V6 engine used in the 1990 Honda NSX. The Legend Turbo can be identified as by a &quot;TURBO&quot; badge attached to the front grille on the bottom right hand side and a &quot;V6Ti&quot; rear badge.

===North American market===
===European market===
The Honda Legend was introduced for the 1987 model year and was virtually identical in equipment offered and vehicle dimensions to the North American model, with one trim designation called the V6-2.5i. This means very few options were available other than the choice of transmission, and an air conditioning system identical to the North American version. The Europeans were offered an optional &quot;Special Equipment Pack&quot; that offered cruise control, aluminium alloy wheels, a driver&#x27;s seat with power lumbar support, height, fore/aft and reclining adjusters, adjustable rear headrests, a 4-speaker stereo system provided by Philips and headlight wipers. Front and rear mud flaps were standard in undisclosed countries but not all. The radio volume control rocker switch and preset radio scan button installed on the instrument binnacle was not offered.

===Legend coupe and other changes===
The Legend Coupe was introduced February 6, 1987, with a larger displacement 2.7-liter V6 engine featuring a variable intake system for increased torque and a rear double wishbone suspension which wasn&#x27;t available on the sedan until 1989 model year. Incidentally, the Japanese coupe was both longer and wider, which increased its tax liability, yet it had a shorter wheelbase by .

Starting with the introduction of model year 1988, the trim level &quot;Exclusive&quot; was introduced, offering genuine wood trim provided by Tendo Mokko on the dashboard and center console with a very large selection of available wood type and hues to choose from, automatic headlights, headlight washer/wipers, separate rear passenger climate control, and chrome-plated power folding mirrors and door handles with infrared remote keyless entry. October 14, 1988 saw a minor restyle offered for the interior and dashboard, to provide a more luxurious appearance in comparison to the Nissan and Toyota uplevel sedans the Legend was competing with. Due to the success Honda had with the Legend, it served as an inspiration for many vehicles from multiple manufacturers, including the Subaru Legacy with which it shares many visual resemblances and dimensions both inside and out.

===Engine specifications===

==Second generation (KA7/8; 1990)==
The second generation model was introduced on October 24, 1990, and continued to offer both a sedan and coupé. The Rover 800 was not updated to the new platform, and instead continued with the old XX platform. In Japan, this Legend was also known as the &quot;Super Legend&quot; due to the much larger 3.2 C32A engine, which was now the only engine offered in the Legend. The Type I engine was rated at , and the Type II was rated at and was included with the Touring system. This Legend benefited from much of the research and testing done for Honda&#x27;s new mid-engined high performance sports car, the Honda NSX, and the Legend was used as a test platform for new NSX technologies and research. Honda mounted the engine behind the front axle, for what they called a &quot;front-wheel-drive midship&quot; layout. Nonetheless, the 60/40 weight distribution was still heavily biased towards the front wheels. Honda introduced a passenger side airbag on this model, and used off-set collision testing to improve collision performance and safety.

Trim level designations were changed to α (&quot;Alpha&quot;) for the top level vehicle, and β (&quot;Beta&quot;) for the lower grade. No other trim levels were offered. The &quot;Alpha&quot; was very well equipped, offering ABS, leather or 100% wool moquette upholstery, projector beam headlights, and dual-zone air conditioning.

The customer base served by the slightly smaller first generation Legend was now offered the completely revised CB5 series Honda Vigor and Honda Inspire sold at different Japanese Honda retail sales locations &quot;Honda Clio&quot; and &quot;Honda Verno&quot;. The business practice of offering the previous generation Legend in two sizes so that it could comply with Japanese dimension and engine displacement regulations was ceded to the Inspire and Vigor, where both vehicles were offered in two versions so as to comply with the regulations, while offering Japanese buyers more choices. The installation of the larger 3.2-litre engine obligated Japanese buyers for higher amounts of annual road tax over the smaller engines in the previous generation.

The Japanese Domestic Market version of the 1990 Legend (second generation) was the second vehicle offered with a navigation system called the Electro Gyrocator (first being the 1981 Honda Accord and Vigor), although it was not satellite-based and instead relied on a gas gyroscope (Inertial navigation system). September 29, 1992 saw an upgrade to the &quot;Alpha&quot; trim level, called the Touring Series, which added the Honda Progressive Damper suspension system, and included upgraded calipers for the front and rear disc brakes, and increased the wheel size to 16 inches. A Luxman premium sound system was added to the options list. The prefectural police department of Aomori used &quot;Beta&quot; sedans with the Type II engine for traffic monitoring.

===Daewoo Arcadia===

The second-generation Legend was also manufactured by Daewoo in South Korea from 1994 to 1999 under the name of Daewoo Arcadia (:ko:대우 아카디아 ), for the Korean market, replacing the Daewoo Imperial.

It was named for the region in Greece called Arcadia, a region regarded in Greek mythology as a utopian garden.

During this period, Honda had a loose alliance with Daewoo, and the Arcadia was larger than Hyundai Grandeur and Kia Potentia competitors. Daewoo Motors (GM Korea&#x27;s predecessor) sold more than 800 vehicles. The Arcadia was essentially the base level Legend. At the time of the Arcadia&#x27;s introduction, it had a large engine for a car in Korea, with a 220-horsepower V6 3.2 C32A, and the starting price was a high 41.9 million won. ABS, dual airbags, safety belt pre-tensioners, and the most advanced car safety features at the time, commensurate with a focus on protecting the passengers. Some of the features included driver&#x27;s seat position memory function and front heated seats, push-button door opening and closing devices, automatic climate control air conditioning. After the acquisition of SsangYong by Daewoo, the Arcadia was succeeded by the somewhat larger Chairman (a rebadged SsangYong). Remaining stock of Arcadia sedans were reduced in price, and the Arcadia ended production in December of that year.
==Third generation (KA9; 1995)==


The third generation Legend appeared on October 26, 1995, continuing the Honda tradition of front-wheel drive, and increasing the engine displacement to 3.5 L with the horsepower remaining at . The actual Honda internal platform code for this vehicle is E-KA9.

In an attempt by Honda to dispute the call for the Legend to be offered with a V8 to be considered an international premium level luxury car, this generation had a wheelbase that compared to the Infiniti Q45 at with a length at , and the Lexus LS at wheelbase and length. The Legend also had very similar dimensions to the front-wheel drive, V8 sedan Mitsubishi Proudia which was sold only in Japan. In Japan, the Legend continued to compete with the Toyota Crown, the Mitsubishi Debonair, the Mazda Luce, and the Nissan Cedric and Gloria at the executive sedan segment.

The trim level &quot;Exclusive&quot; returned as the upper level car, with the standard grade vehicle known as &quot;Euro&quot;, with the more performance tuned suspension.The wood trim used was more upscale for the &quot;Exclusive&quot; vehicle with a lower grade wood used on the &quot;Euro&quot;. Both vehicles were very well equipped. The instruments used were simplified from previous versions, but 100% wool moquette upholstery was still offered, along with optional leather. Honda&#x27;s internet-based navigation system Internavi was introduced with this generation on Japanese domestic vehicles. The Luxman premium sound system was still available. The styling was said to more closely resemble the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and a transponder key security system was offered. Starting with this generation, cabin air filters (also known as pollen filters) were installed as standard equipment and are located behind the glove compartment internationally.

September 21, 1998 saw a minor styling change, with the front grille cutting into the front bumper, providing a more prominent front grille. Emphasis was increased on providing a luxurious sense of style, both inside and out. Side impact airbags now complemented the dual front airbags as standard equipment. The steering wheel can be automatically adjusted based on the position of the driver&#x27;s seat, thereby optimizing a safe distance between the driver and the airbag installed in the steering wheel.

September 24, 1999 saw the engine meet emission regulations to comply with California LEV requirements.

June 19, 2003 saw the interior updated, and maple wood was offered for interior decoration. Electro-luminescent instruments were offered, as well as a higher grade of leather interior.

The third-generation model was offered as a sedan only. A mid-term facelift came in 1999. The Legend went on sale in Australia starting with the 1997 model year.

In the U.S. market, when the Legend coupe was discontinued, they were offered the Acura CL two-door coupé that was based on the American market Honda Accord coupé, so as to continue offering a premium vehicle in this niche.

===North American model===
==Fourth generation (KB1/2; 2004)==

The swoopier, shorter fourth-generation Honda Legend was launched on October 7, 2004, and became Japan&#x27;s Car of the Year for 2004–2005, marking the fourth time in five years that Honda has taken the award. Its reduced dimensions over the third generation model seem to suggest a return to what made the Legend so popular with the first generation, being a top level sedan that offered something different from its competitors. The 2011 model marks the 25th anniversary of Honda Legend production.

In an attempt to address market driven requests that the Legend needed to be a rear-wheel drive sedan with a V8 engine, Honda introduced four-wheel drive technology on the Legend, called &quot;Super Handling All-Wheel Drive&quot; (SH-AWD), which earned Honda the Japan Car of the Year, and Mosuto 2005 Annual RJC technology of the Year award. This generation Legend is only available with the Super Handling All-Wheel Drive powertrain. Due to continuous product improvement efforts over past generations, the series CP3 North American Honda Accord (Honda Inspire in some markets) shares wheelbase, length, width and engine displacement almost exactly with this generation Legend, with a reduced price in many international markets. The Legend does have a higher level of standard features and optional equipment but not by much.

Select-Shift was introduced on the 5-speed automatic transmission. The newly designed J35A 3.5-liter V6 was changed from a 90 degree &quot;V&quot;, in use since the first 1986 C25A V6 engine, to a 60 degree layout, while VTEC was added to improve efficiency (M-TEC was added by the MUGEN division, called the &quot;M1 package&quot;). In a move echoing the many &quot;firsts&quot; introduced by the first generation Legend, the horsepower no longer complied with the self-imposed horsepower restrictions of the Japanese auto industry. The engine is capable of .

Perhaps to accommodate the all-wheel drive setup, the engine was reoriented from a longitudinal installation used since 1990, to a transverse installation, which was the original orientation of the first generation model. Honda began to expand the Acura division into Mexico, Hong Kong and China. Plans to introduce the Acura brand in Japan haven&#x27;t been formally announced, relying on speculation. This generation Legend shares large sedan duties with the Honda Inspire, known in North America as the Honda Accord starting with model year 2003 (series UC1) and continuing with the series CP3 sedan. September 15, 2005 saw a mild body restyle, which included a rear backup camera. The Akita and Kumamoto Prefectures adopted this Legend as the official car for local senior government officials.

In the UK, the Legend is only offered in one trim, the EX. Buyers can also choose to pay extra for the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assist System) package. The ADAS package includes Honda&#x27;s CMBS (Collision Mitigation Braking System), and LKAS (Lane Keeping Assist System).

The Legend received a Mid-Model Change (MMC) for the 2009 model year. Among the usual upgrades, the Honda Legend offered some additional optional safety features, including Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS). The LKAS could actually make small steering adjustments to keep a car in lane so long as the radius of the turn was more than 220 meters, which was the legal minimum in Japan. The LKAS would relinquish control at the slightest steering input so the driver had control at all times. Intelligent Night Vision with the world&#x27;s first pedestrian detection feature, and a standard pop-up hood for pedestrian safety.
The night vision system uses a separate heads up type display projected on the center bottom of the windshield. The infrared cameras do not require a light source, and the software is able to detect human like figures, surround the image with a red box and give audible caution tones. The pop-up hood uses a series of sensors that can detect a pedestrian-like object being thrown onto the hood. An actuator will pop the hood up at the rear, close to the base of the windshield, 10 cm (4 inches) to help minimize pedestrian injuries, especially head trauma. All markets feature energy absorbing hood and fender supports and deformable windshield wiper pivots to minimize pedestrian injury. Honda&#x27;s internet-based navigation system Internavi is standard equipment on Japanese domestic vehicles.

In October 2010, it is reported that Brake Defect from Honda Legend were delivered to customers before the problem is discovered. Honda says that it doesn&#x27;t know how many of its vehicles have suffered a faulty brake system. The U.S. Honda outfit says it will replace the faulty seal and, if leaking has occurred, the brake booster will be replaced as well. At least some owners in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries are likely affected. Honda told that no stop-sale is issued.

In June 2012, Honda Japan announced the Legend and Inspire were to stop being produced at the Sayama, Saitama, Japan plant.
===Reception===
The second-generation 2005 Acura RL appeared on &quot;Car and Driver&quot;″s Ten Best list for 2005. The car also garnered a CNET.com &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; Award for Top Tech Car.

The SH-AWD all-wheel drive system was lauded by &quot;Popular Science&quot; as one of the best automotive innovations of 2004, and earned the 2005 &quot;Tech Car of the Year&quot; from CNET.com. Subsequent moves by both Audi and BMW to design and market their own versions of torque vectoring all-wheel drive systems bear out the innovative nature of the SH-AWD design.

While critically acclaimed, sales have not met expectations. Regarding sales of Japanese luxury flagships during the first six months of 2010, Acura has sold only 872 RLs, compared to 5,650 Lexus LS and 6,602 Infiniti M sedans. Enthusiasts and dealers said that the RL was not competitive because it is smaller, uses front-wheel drive, and lacks a V8 option, compared to its larger rivals in the mid-luxury segment that are rear-wheel drive and have a V8 available.

Some have suggested that the initial price of the RL is perceived to be out of its bracket. As the new RL offered more features and performance than the base version of its luxury competitors (i.e., the base six-cylinder BMW 5 Series), Honda Japan suggested that it could charge more, though Honda Canada disagreed. The RL&#x27;s initial MRSP was $69,500 CAD, more than the six-cylinder BMW 525i and close to that of the V8-powered BMW 545i. At the RL&#x27;s price point, most consumers expected a V8, furthermore they did not perceive Acura as being on par with its German rivals and expected more value from the Japanese marque. The damage from Honda Japan&#x27;s alleged hubris was done, perhaps giving the RL an unfavorable impression that could not be removed, even though Honda Canada has since reduced the RL&#x27;s price. The UK magazine `Car` ran a Honda Legend on its long term fleet and rated the car for its performance, handling and acceleration but felt the styling was too anonymous. In 2009, the new generation of the Acura TL was released and it is expected to offer tough competition to the RL, as the TL has essentially the same engine (but with 5 more horsepower), the SH-AWD system, similar dimensions, and many of the RL&#x27;s features for only $44,900 CAD.

In October 2010, the Acura RL has been named as one of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; most reliable cars, one of among 5 Honda models (Acura TL with front-wheel drive; Acura RL luxury car; Honda CR-V small SUV; Acura RDX small upscale SUV, and Honda Ridgeline compact pickup truck) named as most reliable in various categories.

==Fifth generation (KC2; 2014)==

The fifth generation Legend was unveiled in Japan on November 10, 2014, and went on sale on February 20, 2015, it is near identical to the Acura RLX and only available in Sport Hybrid. The facelifted model was unveiled in Japan on October 2, 2017, and launched at the Tokyo Motor Show on October 27, 2017.

===Facelift===

The front fascia of the facelifted model is based from the facelifted RLX. It is equipped with HONDA Sensing which now includes Traffic Jam Assist (Congestion Driving Support Function) which support steering, acceleration, braking, and camera/sensor harmony when congested in traffic jams. The length grew to 5,032 mm, making it the longest Honda/Acura sedan to date, with length exceeding 5,000 mm.
===Discontinued sales of RLX===
2020 was the final model year for the North American Acura RLX due to low sales, with no direct successor planned.

===Hybrid EX===
On March 5, 2021, Honda began lease sales in Japan of the all-new Legend equipped with &quot;Honda SENSING Elite&quot;, which is a variation of Honda SENSING, a suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies currently available for Honda vehicles around the world. One of the “elite” technologies is the “Traffic Jam Pilot” function, an advanced technology qualifying for Level 3 automated driving (conditional automated driving in limited area).

===Discontinuation===
In June 2021, it was announced that the Sayama plant that produces the Legend would be closed at the end of 2021 and the current car would not have a successor. With the discontinuation, Honda Accord is once again the largest Honda sedan.

<doc id="1059622" wikidata="Q344729" url="?curid=1059622" title="Christos Sartzetakis">
<text>Christos Sartzetakis (; 6 April 1929 – 3 February 2022) was a Greek jurist and a supreme justice of the Court of Cassation, who served as the president of Greece from 1985 to 1990.

==Early life and education==
Sartzetakis was born in Neapoli, Thessaloniki, on 6 April 1929. His father, who served as a Gendarmerie officer in Thessaloniki, was a Cretan born in Kandanos, Chania, and his mother was a Greek Macedonian born in Sklithro, Florina.

He obtained a degree in law from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

==Legal career==
Sartzetakis entered the judicial career in 1955, became Justice of the Peace at Kleisoura, Kastoria, and in 1963, served as judge of the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki.

===Assassination of Grigoris Lambrakis and imprisonment by junta===
On 27 May 1963, the left-wing Member of Parliament Grigoris Lambrakis died four days after being beaten. Sartzetakis was called by the attorney of the Greek Supreme Court Constantine Kollias to proceed with the investigation, as the case was transferred to the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki. In March 1964, he sent a letter to the Minister of Justice Polychronis Polychronidis in which he implicated the police and the State as responsible for the murder. Together with the prosecutor Stylianos Boutis, he ordered the preventive detention of four officers.

The trial began on 3 October 1966 and lasted 67 days at the Criminal Court of Thessaloniki. Sarzetakis and the prosecutor Pavlos Dellaportas were under intense pressure to quickly close the case without continuing the investigation. Two months later, the verdict was announced in which 21 defendants and all agents were acquitted, thus rejecting the prosecutor&#x27;s proposal. Only two persons were convicted as perpetrators, and both were pardoned by the Junta shortly thereafter. Kollias, who soon became Prime Minister under the military junta, claimed that &quot;Sartzetakis will answer to me.&quot; In his memoirs, published after leaving the presidency, he stressed that Lambrakis&#x27; death was a clear political assassination with direct state involvement.

Sartzetakis was expelled from the judiciary along with 29 magistrates with the Greek Junta&#x27;s Constitutional Act of 28 May 1968, allegedly because &quot;in the exercise of his functions, he acted in a discriminatory manner, motivated by his political convictions in favor of a political party, in a way that violated the confidence of the citizens in his impartiality&quot;.

The Lambrakis investigation was the theme of the 1966 novel &quot;Z&quot; by Vassilis Vassilikos, and Sartzetakis was portrayed by Jean-Louis Trintignant in the novel&#x27;s 1969 film adaptation by Costas Gavras.

After the Lambrakis prosecution, with permission to study commercial law and European Community law, Sartzetakis moved to Paris.

He was twice arrested by the Junta, first on Christmas Eve of 1970, and was tortured by Greek Military Police. After an international outcry, he was released from the Junta&#x27;s prison in 1971.

===Restoration of democracy===
In September 1974, after the toppling of the dictatorship and the restoration of democracy in Greece, Sartzetakis was completely rehabilitated. As a member of the Court of Appeals, in 1976 he rejected Germany&#x27;s request to extradite the terrorist Rolf Pohle, arguing that his crimes were political and the Greek constitution prevented extradition in such cases. The prosecutor of the Supreme Court initiated disciplinary proceedings against him and the other two judges who issued that decision. He was named president of the Court of Appeals in 1981 and became a member of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece in 1982.

==President of Greece (1985–1990)==
The atmosphere just prior to the 1985 presidential elections was particularly unstable politically and the media of the time and the political parties considered the re-election of Konstantinos Karamanlis as President of the Republic as certain. It was then that the Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou nominated Sartzetakis, a judge who had not been involved in politics, as a candidate to succeed Karamanlis, the surprising announcement and the tactics employed by Papandreou for making Sartzetakis president resulted in constitutional crisis. On 10 March 1985, immediately following the public announcement of this decision, Karamanlis resigned in the face of PASOK&#x27;s unexpected rejection of his re-election and because of his opposition to Papandreou&#x27;s recently announced plans to reform the 1975 Constitution and transfer the few executive powers from the President of the Republic to the Prime Minister. Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament Ioannis Alevras took over as acting President of Greece.

The first vote in the Greek parliament took place on 17 March, in which Sartzetakis obtained 178 votes as a sole candidate. The second vote was held on 23 March and he obtained support from 181 of the deputies. That vote was controversial as the ballot papers were of different colors, with Sartzetakis&#x27; being blue and the others white, causing a violation of the secrecy of the vote. It was not until the third and stormy vote, held on 29 March, for Sartzetakis to be elected the new president to a 5-year term, thanks to the votes of the 180 deputies from PASOK and the Communist Party. Shortly thereafter, he issued a televised message in which he called for unity, reaffirming that &quot;our country is too small to support the luxury of national divisions&quot;.

He was sworn in on 30 March in a ceremony boycotted by the 112 deputies of the conservative opposition (ND), who refused to attend based on the allegation that the election had been rendered unconstitutional when the acting Greek president Alevras, the then president of the Parliament, was allowed to vote.

In 1986, Sartzetakis strongly opposed the bill that legalized abortion in the country. Between 1989 and 1990, he had to face an unprecedented triple electoral repetition due to the inability of the parties to form a government, mainly because to the Koskotas scandal implicating Papandreou and Papandreou&#x27;s change of electoral law to prevent opposition party in gaining majority power. In 1987, Christos Roussos, a young homosexual sentenced to life imprisonment in 1976 for murder, went on hunger strike. Faced with this situation, and heeding his appeal for a mistrial because he had murdered the man who wanted to prostitute him, the Papandreou government pardoned him, but was met with Sartzetakis&#x27; refusal to grant it. This fact provoked a wave of indignation accusing Sartzetakis of being a homophobe and soured his relationship with Prime Minister Papandreou. The pardon ultimately was granted in 1990 by Karamanlis.

His personality as president was assiduously criticized and satirized. He demanded that newspapers refer to him as &quot;Sir&quot; with a capital &quot;K&quot; (), used the conservative form of modern Greek called katharevousa and was altogether considered a strict formalist with rigid thinking far removed from the people. Sartzetakis did, however, ascribe the same honor to other political personalities, such as Prime Ministers Andreas Papandreou, Costas Simitis, Konstantinos Mitsotakis and later President Konstantinos Stephanopoulos.

He was criticized for buying air conditioners, expensive at the time, on his return from China and not passing through customs. However, it was claimed that the reported shopping while on official visits shouldn&#x27;t be solely attributed to him. On two occasions he denounced comedians for making fun of him. In 1986 Sartzetakis appeared in a photograph with the-admittedly large-iron cross and the staff of Athanasius the Athonite at the Great Lavra. Harry Klynn satirized him on the cover of his album &quot;Τίποτα&quot;. It was then that he was sued alleging insults to religious symbols, although Klynn was acquitted. The following year, the comedian Lakis Lazopoulos was arrested after publishing criticism of the political situation; he was acquitted.

Sartzetakis was also the first president to welcome resistance fighters to the Presidential Palace for the 24 July celebration.

Although he held anticommunist opinions and considered the defeat of DSE in 1949 a &quot;national victory&quot;, he stressed the need for a genuine national reconciliation based on remembrance, thus disagreeing with the discontinuation of memorial services for the fallen of the Armed Forces and the taboo treatment of the subject in education. He, nevertheless, cooperated with Charilaos Florakis during the 1989 political crisis and eulogised him after his passing in 2005, praising the late communist leader for his &quot;straightness, honesty and political rectitude&quot;.

His term of office ended on 5 May 1990 after failing to secure enough support for a second term in the 1990 presidential elections. Konstantinos Karamanlis took office for his second term as president after being elected the previous day by an absolute majority in Parliament. He then retired from public life, but continued to publish opinions in newspapers and articles on his website.

==Personal life and death==
Sartzetakis married Efi Argyriou with whom he had a daughter.

On 3 December 2021, he was intubated due to acute pneumonia in Laiko Hospital in Athens. Sartzetakis died of acute respiratory failure on 3 February 2022, at the age of 92. The government announced a period of national mourning between 3 and 5 February, with flags lowered to half-mast. The state funeral took place on 7 February at Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens and he was later buried in First Cemetery of Athens in an intimate family ceremony.

<doc id="1059630" wikidata="Q916870" url="?curid=1059630" title="Early Spring (1956 film)">
<text>is a 1956 film by Yasujirō Ozu about a married salaryman (Ryō Ikebe) who escapes the monotony of married life and his work at a fire brick manufacturing company by beginning an affair with a fellow office worker (Keiko Kishi). The film also deals with the hardships of the salaryman lifestyle. &quot;I wanted,&quot; Ozu said, &quot;to portray what you might call the pathos of the white-collar life.&quot;

With a runtime of 144 minutes, &quot;Early Spring&quot; is Ozu&#x27;s longest surviving film, and his penultimate shot in black and white.

==Plot==
Office worker Shoji Sugiyama (Ryō Ikebe) wakes and goes about his morning routine, attended by his wife, Masako (Chikage Awashima), before commuting to his job in the Tokyo office of a fire brick manufacturing company.

During a hiking trip with office friends, Shoji spends time alone with a fellow worker, a typist nicknamed &quot;Goldfish&quot; for her large eyes (Keiko Kishi). After the trip Goldfish makes advances to Shoji and the two begin an affair. Masako suspects something is amiss but is reluctant to confront her husband. After Shoji fails to mark the anniversary of their son&#x27;s death, he and Masako become progressively estranged.

Their friends, too, suspect something is transpiring between Shoji and Goldfish. They confront Goldfish, advising her not to come between a married couple. Aggrieved, Goldfish visits Shoji late in the night. Masako, convinced that her suspicions have foundation, demands that Shoji tell her the truth about his relationship with Goldfish. Shoji still lies about it, and the next morning Masako leaves the marital home to stay with her mother.

Shoji relocates to his company&#x27;s office in the provincial town of Mitsuishi (now part of Bizen). Masako eventually travels to Mitsuishi and the couple is reunited. They promise to forget their past troubles and strive for marital happiness.

==Production==
After the release of &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;, Ozu was called upon to assist his friend, the actress Kinuyo Tanaka, in completing her second film as director, &quot;The Moon Has Risen&quot;. By the time production on &quot;Early Spring&quot; began, Ozu had been away from the director&#x27;s chair for three years: a substantial hiatus for someone who had averaged a picture a year since the end of the Second World War. In the meantime, the &quot;Ofuna-cho&quot; or &quot;home drama&quot;, the genre of film with which Ozu was most closely associated, had decreased in popularity. Ozu maintained that &quot;the traditions of the &quot;Ofuna-cho&quot; are the result of 30 years. They are not going to fall in one morning&quot;. Nevertheless, under pressure from his studio, Ozu made several concessions to modernity. He cast mostly young and popular actors, and, with long-time collaborator Kōgo Noda, delivered a script devoid of the dominant parental figures that were a fixture of his previous films. The theme of communication problems between generations, another familiar trope of Ozu&#x27;s work, was also absent. In its place was the theme of disillusionment with life as a salaryman. &quot;I wanted to have a go at representing their lifestyle,&quot; said Ozu. &quot;The thrill and aspirations one feels as a fresh graduate entering society gradually wane as the days go by. Even working diligently for thirty years doesn&#x27;t amount to much.&quot;

&quot;Early Spring&quot; makes use of temporal ellipses, gaps in the narrative into which the audience is invited to project meaning, which are common in Ozu&#x27;s films. For example, after Shoji and Goldfish begin their fling we do not see them alone together until Goldfish visits Shoji&#x27;s home. Since this is after the pair&#x27;s friends have confronted Goldfish, we, like the friends, do not know for certain if the affair is ongoing. Ozu also omits potentially melodramatic moments: Masako does not discover her husband&#x27;s lipstick-stained handkerchief on screen, but instead recounts the discovery to her mother.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval for &quot;Early Spring&quot;, with an average rating of 8/10. In a highly positive review, Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the work &quot;conveys the claustrophobia of office life better than any other film I&#x27;ve seen&quot;, and that &quot;Ozu finds dramatic depths in quiet, ordinary lives. And during the time that you spend with these people—the span of the movie—you really feel that you&#x27;ve come to know them well, to understand why their relationships do or don&#x27;t develop.&quot; Sayre wrote that the characters&#x27; &quot;emotions or hidden instincts are brilliantly revealed through small details&quot;.

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Richard Brody argued that &quot;Ozu’s despairing view of postwar Japan looks as harshly at blind modernization as it does at decadent tradition.&quot; Don Druker of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called the film a &quot;casual yet meticulously detailed reconstruction of Japan&#x27;s routinized white-collar milieu&quot;. Despite the praise, it is not one of Ozu&#x27;s most renowned works.

==Home media==
In 2007, The Criterion Collection released the film as part of the DVD box set &quot;Eclipse Series 3: Late Ozu&quot;.

In 2012, the BFI released the film on Region 2 DVD, along with &quot;Tokyo Twilight&quot; and &quot;Woman of Tokyo&quot;, as &quot;Three Melodramas&quot;.

<text>William Geoffrey Steer (born 3 December 1969) is a British guitarist and co-founder of the extreme metal band Carcass. He is considered a pioneer and an essential contributor to grindcore and death metal due to his involvement in Napalm Death and Carcass, two of the most important bands of those genres. Presently he plays with Gentlemans Pistols, the reactivated Carcass and appeared as a live second guitarist for Angel Witch from 2011 to 2015.

The style of Steer&#x27;s guitar work on early Napalm Death releases has been described as a &quot;frenzied, distorted blur&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in Stockton-on-Tees to a Scottish mother and English father, Steer spent his teenage years in the Wirral. According to various interviews, it was at this time he was exposed to hard rock and heavy metal in the form of Motörhead, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, UFO, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin and so on, followed by lesser-known NWOBHM artists such as Raven, Tank and Venom. These years saw Steer begin playing electric guitar and also becoming one of the earliest tape traders in the UK, immersing himself in the embryonic underground death metal scene. During this time, an early incarnation of Carcass was formed.

Steer appeared in Guitar magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Ten Guitarists You&#x27;ve Never Heard Of&quot; in 1996, was featured in Metal Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Metal Guitar Players&quot; and was ranked no.3 in Decibel Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top Twenty Death Metal Guitarists&quot; as well as No. 92 out of 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World

He was guitarist for Napalm Death from April 1987 – July 1989, appearing on their first two albums as well as the BBC Radio One John Peel Sessions. Throughout this period the group toured across the UK and Europe, only for Steer and vocalist Lee Dorrian to quit immediately after a tour of Japan. He played in Carcass from 1985 to 1995, the only guitarist to feature on all of the band&#x27;s albums and perform throughout their live career. After the demise of Carcass he moved to Australia and developed a passion for blues music, teaching himself harmonica and slide guitar. Upon returning to the UK, he started his own band Firebird, which was mainly inspired by 1970s rock. During this time he was married and then divorced. Firebird split up in late 2011. Steer now plays guitar in the band Gentlemans Pistols and also performed with a new wave of British heavy metal veterans Angel Witch. Steer currently resides in east London.

Steer also appeared along with Jeffrey Walker (bassist/vocalist of Carcass) in an episode of the Sci-Fi comedy Red Dwarf. He performed as the drummer of the band &quot;Smeg and the Heads&quot; named Dobbin in series 3 episode 5 &quot;Timeslides&quot;.

In addition to Steer&#x27;s guitar prowess, he is well known for Jeff Walker&#x27;s naming of his solos on earlier Carcass albums (example: &quot;Maim to Please&quot; by W. G. Steer from &quot;Tools of the Trade&quot;).

In 2008 Steer reunited with his Carcass bandmates (except for drummer Ken Owen, who suffered a cerebral haemorrhage in 1999; Daniel Erlandsson was tapped to play drums in his place) to play at several European festivals such as Wacken &#x27;08. In an interview, Steer mentioned that a new Carcass album could hardly be possible. The Carcass reunion show schedule continued through to 2010, playing festivals and headlining a small US tour in 2009. In 2010, Steer briefly hosted a show at the Internet radio station, TotalRock. Since then, besides playing in various bands, including Angel Witch, he has been involved in the &quot;Friday Night Powerhouse&quot; club in London.

Carcass started rehearsing again in May 2012, and played at the Maryland Deathfest XI music festival in May 2013. In mid-2013, the band released &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;, on which Steer played lead guitars with some backing vocals.

Steer plays old Gibson Les Paul guitars (primarily Juniors and Customs), and uses vintage fifty-watt Marshall amplifiers. He has used a white Schecter Strategy on the first two albums, a black Ibanez S540LTD on Necroticism, a Peavey Nitro III, and on the Heartwork album he used Marshall SL-X and anniversary heads as well as the Peavey 5150. Steer has also used ESP Eclipse model guitars. In recent years he has avoided endorsements.

Steer has been a vegetarian since 1986 and was also vegan for a period of time.

Steer married his long-term girlfriend in the summer of 2021.

<doc id="1059636" wikidata="Q4828072" url="?curid=1059636" title="Avengers Forever">
<text>Avengers Forever is a twelve-issue comic book limited series published from December 1998 to November 1999 by Marvel Comics. It follows the storyline of Rick Jones and his quest to build a team of Avengers from the past, present, and future. The series was written by Kurt Busiek and Roger Stern and drawn by Carlos Pacheco and Jesus Merino. In 2021, a new &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; series was released, following the character Ghost Rider.

==Publication history==
Marvel originally contracted Busiek and Pacheco to produce a series called &quot;Avengers: World in Chains&quot;, but it was too similar to another project (presumably Mutant X) and was canceled by the company. Because Busiek and Pacheco were under contract, the pair instead developed the concept for &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Immortus sends his servant Tempus to kill an apparently critically ill Rick Jones, the possessor of the &quot;Destiny Force&quot;, a powerful ability used during the Kree–Skrull War storyline.

Rick is saved by Kang the Conqueror (who is destined to evolve into Immortus), who destroys Tempus and holds off Immortus&#x27; temporal army. The Supreme Intelligence urges Rick to use the Destiny Force to summon aid. With the help of former Zodiac member Libra, Rick pulls various members of the superhero team Avengers from the past, present, and future. The team consists of a disillusioned Captain America, who is pulled from an adventure in which he discovers a high-ranking government official is the leader of the Secret Empire; Yellowjacket from a time when he is mentally unbalanced and unaware that he is Hank Pym; Hawkeye from just after the conclusion of the Kree–Skrull War and war against Olympus; Giant-Man (also Hank Pym) and Wasp from the present; Songbird from an unspecified time in the near future; and Captain Marvel from further in the future.

Although these Avengers appear almost randomly selected, Libra states that they have been chosen due to his subtle awareness of the universal balance, each one fulfilling an eventually clarified role in events: 

* Cap&#x27;s presence brought cohesion to the team while his weakened mental state due to his current lack of confidence prevented him from dominating it;
* The Wasp led the team with strength and flexibility that gave them direction without exerting too much control;
* Yellowjacket&#x27;s eventual betrayal of the team due to his current instability would bring them into the right position to strike;
* Giant-Man provided support while irritating and provoking Yellowjacket;
* Hawkeye&#x27;s presence affected both Yellowjacket&#x27;s and Libra&#x27;s responses to the crisis;
* Songbird&#x27;s skewed connections to Hawkeye, the Wasp, and Captain Marvel in the past, present, and future affected Captain Marvel&#x27;s own decisions regarding Rick Jones&#x27;s fate.

During their efforts to protect Rick, the Avengers battle Immortus across several different eras, including encounters in the American Old West with the Two-Gun Kid, the Night Rider, the Ringo Kid, the Rawhide Kid, Kid Colt, and the Gunhawks, as well as an alternate version of the Avengers from the 1950s, and a confrontation to thwart an alien invasion in a possible future. During their searches, they discover that Immortus possesses the Forever Crystal, an artifact that can control multiple realities. Kang aids the Avengers as part of his &#x27;rebellion&#x27; against his apparent destiny, and reveals that Immortus serves a trio of entities called the Time Keepers, with his previous interactions with the team having been motivated by an effort to keep humanity limited to prevent them from developing into a threat to the universe. These entities eventually reveal that, in various futures, mankind will travel into space and establish the warlike Terran Empire, an interstellar dictatorship policed by the Galactic Avengers Battalion and ruled by humans with access to the Destiny Force, which will thrive at the cost of many alien cultures. A future version of the Avengers will apparently be at the forefront of the expansion, but the Avengers reject the idea that mankind must be destroyed or contained to prevent these futures&#x27; happening, with Captain America and Songbird arguing that humanity deserves a chance to show that it can be better rather than being condemned for things that have not happened yet.

Kang aids the Avengers and, in the final battle, kills the Time Keepers when they attempt to punish Immortus for failing. The Avengers resolve to strike against the Time Keepers even after they learn their enemies&#x27; motives, arguing that the Time Keepers only seek to eliminate those that might threaten them, when they do not even attempt to erase themselves, despite the existence of alternate timelines where they themselves became the Time Twisters. During a mass conflict where the Time-Keepers unleash the Avengers of the corrupted timelines against an army of Avengers drawn from the worlds where they remained true to their original purpose, the Time Keepers attempt to force Kang to become Immortus after they kill the future Immortus for his attempt to protect the Avengers. However, Kang&#x27;s strength of will and the unique temporal conditions of the conflict results in a temporal backlash, culminating in Kang and Immortus being recreated as separate beings. When Rick is injured using the Destiny Force to destroy the Time-Keepers&#x27; equipment, Captain Marvel merges with Rick to save his life—the link with Marvel&#x27;s future self resulting in Rick being unintentionally linked to Marvel&#x27;s present self when he, Giant-Man, and the Wasp return to their present—and all the Avengers are returned to their respective timelines with a lingering memory of the incident.

===Aftermath===
While Genis-Vell is revealed to have come from a few months in the future, with the greater age of Rick&#x27;s future self revealed to be the result of accelerated aging while helping Thanos separate Death from Marlo Chandler, it is generally accepted that the Songbird who fought with the Avengers in this storyline originated from an alternate future rather than the future.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a single volume:
* &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; (softcover, &quot;Avengers Legends: Volume 1&quot;, 264 pages, January 2001, , hardcover, 296 pages, September 2009, )

==2021 series==

In 2021, a new &quot;Avengers: Forever&quot; series was released. It details Ghost Rider and one of the Deathloks working for the mysterious Avenger Prime traveling across the Multiverse to put together an army of Multiversal Avengers in order to combat the Multiversal Masters of Evil who have either conquered other Earths.

<text>Károly Grósz (1 August 1930 – 7 January 1996) was a Hungarian communist politician, who served as the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party from 1988 to 1989.

==Early career==
Grósz was born in Miskolc, Hungary. He joined the Hungarian Communist Party in 1945 at the age of 14. The Communists took full power in 1949, and Grósz rose through the party ranks, becoming an important party leader in his native region. He functioned as head of the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County branch of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP) from 1954. He also held the position during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when he banned local journals from coverage of events and forced to remove Kossuth Coat of Arms from letterhead of local newspaper &quot;Észak-Magyarország&quot;. On 4 November 1956, after the revolution was crushed, Grósz was appointed head of the local party apparatus of the ruling communist party.

In 1974 he was appointed head of the Department of Agitation and Propaganda of the governing Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. In 1979 Grósz was elected first secretary of the party committee of his home county. In 1984 he returned to national prominence as the head of the party committee in Budapest. At the next Party Congress in 1985, he became a member of the Politburo. In 1987, he was appointed Prime Minister of Hungary (Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary - the second most powerful position after that of General Secretary) to succeed György Lázár, who had filled the post for more than eleven years. The appointment of the younger and more energetic Grósz was acclaimed both at home and abroad.

As the country was facing economic troubles and growing discontent, the aging party leader János Kádár decided to resign, although originally he had planned to remain in office until 1990. In May 1988 a party conference was convened, which elected Grósz as general secretary of the party at Kádár&#x27;s recommendation on 22 May 1988. He advocated moderate and measured changes in the political and economic spheres. As he put it, this would result in a careful reform of the Communist system without touching the latter&#x27;s foundations. He liked to call this a &quot;model change&quot; (i.e. reforms and refinements within the Communist framework), as opposed to the total &quot;system change&quot;, i.e. the replacement of Communism by a Western-style system, advocated by a growing faction of radical reformers in the party.

==Leader of Hungary== 

Grósz remained prime minister until 24 November 1988, when he was succeeded by Miklós Németh, a representative of the radical reformer faction.

As 1989 wore on, Grósz was increasingly sidelined by the radical reformers within the party, including Németh, Rezső Nyers, Gyula Horn and Imre Pozsgay. He tried to slow down, stop or reverse the radical changes advocated by his adversaries that were aimed at establishing a liberal political system and market economy in Hungary. He opposed the rehabilitation of the executed Imre Nagy, Prime Minister during the 1956 revolution. In order to prevent Nagy&#x27;s political rehabilitation, Grósz gave a speech before the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party on 1 September 1989, where he provided some information on the former prime minister&#x27;s alleged NKVD ties, however the committee decided not to publish the charges.

Grósz&#x27;s fate was sealed when he agreed to meet with Romanian leader Nicolae Ceaușescu to discuss what to do with a large number of ethnic Hungarians who had fled Romania. Many of Grósz&#x27; party colleagues thought he trusted Ceaușescu too much. He lost a good deal of authority as a result, and his standing never really recovered.

On 26 June 1989, he became a member of a four-man collective presidency of the MSZMP, chaired by Nyers. Although Grósz retained his post as general secretary, Nyers now outranked him–and thus replaced him as the de facto leader of Hungary. However, he opposed the radical reformers&#x27; drive to reorganize the party as a social democratic party. He remained general secretary until 7 October, when the party reorganized itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party.

==Later life==
The communist (&quot;hardline&quot;) faction, led by Grósz, was defeated at the congress and broke away in December 1989 as a new Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, with Grósz as its first acting chairman (later renamed Workers&#x27; Party and the &#x27;Communist Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;). The party failed to win parliamentary representation in the first multiparty election in the newly formed Republic of Hungary. These elections took place on 25 March and 8 April 1990.

On 7 January 1996, he died of kidney cancer at age 65 in Gödöllő, Hungary.

<doc id="1059649" wikidata="Q1451232" url="?curid=1059649" title="Stoney Creek, Ontario">
<text>Stoney Creek is a community in the city of Hamilton in the Canadian province of Ontario located 10 km east of Downtown Hamilton and 57 km south-west of Toronto. It was a municipality until 2001, when it was amalgamated with Hamilton, Dundas, Ancaster, Flamborough and Glanbrook to form the City of Hamilton.

The community of Stoney Creek is located on the south shore of western Lake Ontario, east of downtown Hamilton, into which feed the watercourses of Stoney Creek as well as several other minor streams. The historic area, known as the &quot;Old Town&quot;, is below the Niagara Escarpment.

Stoney Creek experienced an increase in residential growth, particularly in the lower city in the 1970s and 1980s, and in the west mountain in the 1990s and 2000s, but most of the land mass of Stoney Creek remains agricultural. The communities of Elfrida, Fruitland, Tapleytown, Tweedside, Vinemount, and Winona serve as distinct reminders of the agricultural legacy of Stoney Creek and Saltfleet Township.

== History ==
Stoney Creek was explored by French-Canadian fur traders before the area was settled by Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution in the late 1700s. The name &#x27;Stoney Creek&#x27; is derived from the area&#x27;s central watercourse, Stoney Creek, which runs from the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl, in the Niagara Escarpment, to Lake Ontario. It is often taken for granted the &#x27;Stoney Creek&#x27; is a description of the creek&#x27;s rockiness although some evidence suggests the name comes from an early settler Edmund Stoney. Others say that it refers to a type of &#x27;Stoney&#x27; flour that was produced by the stone mills in the area at the time.

On June 6, 1813, the settlement garnered some notability during the War of 1812 as the site of the eponymous battle. After being informed of American troop movements by Billy Green, a local hero and the namesake of Billy Green elementary school, British forces overwhelmed the Americans in a surprise night attack.

The Village of Stoney Creek became part of Saltfleet Township upon the latter&#x27;s establishment in 1791, and was later designated a town in 1974, as part of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth. In 1984 it obtained city status, and on January 1, 2001, it was amalgamated into the City of Hamilton.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2001 census, the population of Stoney Creek was 59,327 up 5.5 per cent from the 1996 census. Children under 14 years of age totaled 19.4% while those in retirement age constituted 12.6% of the total population. Some 25.94% or a quarter of the population was foreign born. The census showed that Stoney Creek was 92.72% white (European), of which 55% had British or Irish origins, 16% Italian, 21% Slavic (Croatian, Polish, Serbian, Ukrainian etc.); 3.0% South Asian; 1.0% Black; 1.0% mixed race; and 0.6% Chinese. As of the 2006 census, Stoney Creek&#x27;s population had risen to 62,292. As of the 2021 census, Stoney Creek&#x27;s population had risen to 112,028. The median age of the population was 43.2.

== Economy ==
The temperate environment on the Niagara Peninsula&#x27;s western end made the Stoney Creek area in eastern Wentworth County to be known for fruit growing. In recent decades, as the quality and reputation of Ontario wines grew, Stoney Creek became part of the fringes of the Niagara winery region.

Agriculture continued to be the major employer for decades, only supplanted by others as community growth brought it into closer contact with Hamilton and the great conurbation of the Golden Horseshoe. Stoney Creek became a centre for light industry, road transportation, and commuting residences since its land costs were much lower than in neighbouring Hamilton.

Fiesta Mall is a power centre type mall with Fortinos as the main anchor tenant. The mall had been a drive-in theatre that closed in 1975.

== Attractions ==

In addition to the Stoney Creek, and Battlefield House, the Erland Lee Museum, site of the first Women&#x27;s Institute in the World, is also in Stoney Creek.

Branches of the Bruce Trail provide access to Battlefield Park as well as the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl. The latter is marked by a large illuminated cross and offers an excellent lookout for both Stoney Creek and Hamilton. Other notable green spaces include Fifty Point Conservation Area, which includes camping and a small craft harbour. Both the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl and the large cross mentioned above were featured in the 2006 horror film &quot;Silent Hill&quot; and can be seen during the first few scenes. Another movie filmed in the area was the 1998 film &quot;The Big Hit&quot;, starring Mark Wahlberg.

On a more commercial note, the Winona Peach Festival serves up homegrown fruit, crafts and music. Like the peach festival, the Stoney Creek Flag Festival is also held every summer. The Stoney Creek Dairy on King Street, with a stylized Battlefield Monument in its logo, offered frozen treats to people in the region for decades under a variety of ownership, the current one being Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s. In 2013, the former dairy was torn down for redevelopment. Eastgate Square Mall straddles the former border between Hamilton and Stoney Creek.

In 1965, the Stoney Creek Little League team became the first (and as of 2018, only) Canadian team to play in the World Championship Game. (It lost to Windsor Locks, Connecticut, 3–1.)

== Government ==

Local jam merchant E. D. Smith promoted the area and served as a Wentworth MP around the turn of the 20th century. Otherwise, the most recent political tremor occurred when Tony Valeri, the federal minister of transport who supported Paul Martin as Liberal leader, defeated Sheila Copps, a former Canadian heritage minister who supported Jean Chrétien, in a bitter constituency nomination election after redistricting forced the two sitting MPs head-to-head in the formerly divided Hamilton East-Stoney Creek. From 2006 until 2014, Hamilton East-Stoney Creek has been represented by the New Democratic Party MP Wayne Marston, who was defeated in 2015 by former Mayor and Liberal Party candidate Bob Bratina.

Like its bigger neighbour, Stoney Creek expanded over the 20th century to encompass more and more of its smaller neighbours like Fruitland, Winona, Vinemount, Tapleytown, Tweedside and Elfrida in Saltfleet Township. The Village of Stoney Creek consolidated with Saltfleet Township in 1974 to become the Town of Stoney Creek. Areas it annexed on top of the Niagara Escarpment west of Highway 20 (now known as Upper Centennial Parkway) became known as Upper Stoney Creek or Satellite City.

In 1984, it was granted city status, and was looking to challenge its more populous neighbour. However, over its residents&#x27; strenuous objections, the City of Stoney Creek was amalgamated with Glanbrook, Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough and Hamilton to form the City of Hamilton. However, its suburban voters helped ensure the first mayor of an amalgamated Hamilton came from the former suburbs. The new city&#x27;s second mayor, Larry Di Ianni, had served as a Stoney Creek Councillor for 20 years.

The last mayor of Stoney Creek was Anne Bain.

== Infrastructure ==
Stoney Creek is served by the Queen Elizabeth Way, various current or former Ontario provincial highways and a largely irregular network of residential streets. Portions of Upper Stoney Creek are laid out in a grid pattern. It is served by public transit in the form of the Hamilton Street Railway, or HSR, which has been operated in Stoney Creek by the regional government since 1974 and the megacity government since 2001.

<doc id="1059662" wikidata="Q425719" url="?curid=1059662" title="Floating Weeds">
<text>is a 1959 Japanese drama directed by Yasujirō Ozu, starring Nakamura Ganjirō II and Machiko Kyō. Considered one of the greatest films ever made, it is a remake of Ozu&#x27;s own black-and-white silent film &quot;A Story of Floating Weeds&quot; (1934).

==Plot==
During the summer of 1958 at a seaside town on the Inland Sea, a travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe&#x27;s lead actor and owner, Komajuro. While the rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicize their appearance, Komajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town. They have a grown-up son, Kiyoshi, who works at the post office as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the university. However, he doesn&#x27;t know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle. Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing at sea.

When Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro&#x27;s present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and visits Oyoshi&#x27;s eatery. Komajuro chases her away quickly and confronts her. He tells her to back off from his son and decides to break up with her. Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.

One day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. Although Kayo is initially reluctant, she agrees after Sumiko&#x27;s insistence without being told why. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth about how their relationship started. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter to him, and eventually their relationship is discovered by Komajuro.

Komajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko&#x27;s setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money. Komajuro attacks Sumiko and tells her to disappear from his sight. She pleads for reconciliation but he is indignant.

Meanwhile, the troupe&#x27;s old-fashioned kabuki-style performances fail to attract the town&#x27;s residents; the other actors pursue their own romantic diversions at local businesses, including a brothel and a barber shop. Eventually, the manager of the troupe abandons them and a principal supporting player absconds with the remaining funds. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi&#x27;s place and tells her of the break-up. Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. Komajuro agrees.

When Kiyoshi returns with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a tussle between Kiyoshi and him. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far and goes upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi&#x27;s reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join Komajuro to help him achieve success for the family, but a chastened Komajuro asks her to stay to help make Kiyoshi a fine man, as Komajuro&#x27;s always hoped. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.

At the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches. Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, offers him a light. She asks where he is going and asks to accompany him since she now has no place to go. They reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another impresario at Kuwana.

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;Floating Weeds&quot;, Ozu&#x27;s only film for Daiei, was produced at the studio&#x27;s urging after he completed &quot;Good Morning&quot;, which had fulfilled the director&#x27;s contractual obligation to complete one film per year for Shochiku. Ozu first planned to remake &quot;A Story of Floating Weeds&quot; for Shochiku, and the title was intended to be &quot;A Ham Actor&quot; ( &quot;&quot;, &quot;radish actor&quot;); the stars (most of whom were attached to Shochiku) were to include Eitarō Shindō and Chikage Awashima as the primary leads, Masami Taura and Ineko Arima as the youth leads, and Isuzu Yamada as the former mistress. Filming had been delayed in 1958 due to an unexpectedly mild winter in the Niigata region, where Ozu had hoped to film a snowy location; when the Daiei opportunity arose, he followed through on his plan to move filming to a summer setting in seaside Wakayama. The actors were replaced mostly with Daiei contract players, and the title was changed in deference to Nakamura Ganjirō II, the respected kabuki theater star who played the lead. (When Kiyoshi charges Komajūrō with hamming it up, the actor asserts that it&#x27;s the style of acting that his public pays to see.)

In a bit of stunt casting, Ozu did secure Kōji Mitsui from Shochiku for his seventh and final role for the director, as the character who drives the subplot about the amorous escapades of the supporting players; as Hideo Mitsui, the actor had portrayed the protagonist&#x27;s son in the 1934 version.
The troupe is first observed performing a scene from a play about Chuji Kunisada, a 19th-century historical figure who was romanticised as a forest-dwelling Robin-Hood-like hero in a number of plays, novels, and films. In the scene shown, Kunisada (played by Sumiko) is taking his leave of his faithful companions, Gantetsu and Jōhachi, on Mt. Akagi. Wild geese flying south for the winter and crows returning to their nests are used as images of parting. Ozu includes a small joke in the staging of the scene to confirm that this is not a very polished troupe of actors. When Gantetsu delivers the line, &quot;The wild geese are calling as they fly towards the southern skies,&quot; he points off-stage into the auditorium. So when Sumiko, as Chuji, turns stage left to deliver the line &quot;And the moon is descending behind the western mountains,&quot; she is actually facing east.

Despite Nakamura Ganjirō II&#x27;s fame as a noted star of kabuki theater, he is shown applying full makeup but not actually filmed onstage, though he is heard off-screen as the audience watches him perform and players backstage lament the show&#x27;s poor attendance. Nakamura recalled that he and Machiko Kyo got sick with a cold after filming the confrontation scene between their characters in the rain.

Kazuo Miyagawa served as cinematographer for the film, replacing Ozu&#x27;s favorite cameraman, Yuharu Atsuta. In an interview, Ozu described the film as an experiment on how to bring life to an old fashioned story in a modern setting and noted that by working with Miyagawa, he realized that different colors required varying degrees of lighting.

== Release ==

=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Floating Weeds&quot; was released on November 17, 1959. It was released theatrically in the United States by Altura Films International on November 24, 1970.

===Home media===
&quot;Floating Weeds&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD by The Criterion Collection as a two-disc set with &quot;A Story of Floating Weeds&quot;. An alternate audio track contains a commentary by Roger Ebert.

The two films were re-released by Criterion on a single Region A Blu-ray on May 7, 2024. This new edition of &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; is based on a 4K digital master with an uncompressed Japanese LPCM 1.0 monaural soundtrack.

Subtitles for the Criterion edition of &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; take liberty with lines delivered by Kōji Mitsui early in the film: while wandering through the village in Kabuki costume promoting the troupe&#x27;s appearance, he is asked his name by a prostitute he considers unattractive. He replies &quot;Kinnosuke&quot; rather than his character&#x27;s actual name, Kichinosuke. When she appears surprised, he clarifies that he’s &quot;Kin-Chan,&quot; teasing her that he is the famous Kabuki actor Kinnosuke Nakamura, who was popularly known as &quot;Kin-Chan,&quot; an abbreviation of his name appended with &quot;Chan,&quot; a Japanese honorific of endearment. However, counter to Mitsui&#x27;s clear pronunciations, the Criterion subtitle has him first identify himself as &quot;Mifune,&quot; and after her surprise he says &quot;Toshiro,&quot; presumably an effort to make the exchange relevant to Western audiences by using the name of a more identifiable Japanese star.

==Reception==
&quot;Floating Weeds&quot; is widely acclaimed by film critics. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, and included it on his &quot;Ten Greatest Films of all Time&quot; in 1991. Alan Bett of &quot;The Skinny&quot; gave the film a full five stars. Tom Dawson of BBC gave it four stars out of five. Allan Hunter of &quot;Daily Express&quot; rated it 4/5, while Stuart Henderson of PopMatters gave it a 9/10. 
The film holds a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 23 critics. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Floating Weeds boasts the visual beauty and deep tenderness of director Yasujiro Ozu&#x27;s most memorable films -- and it&#x27;s one of the few the master shot in color.&quot;

In 2002, American film director James Mangold listed &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; as one of the best films of all time. He said, &quot;Ozu is the world&#x27;s greatest director film geeks have never heard of. A poet, humanitarian, stylist, innovator - and a brilliant actors&#x27; director. I would recommend the film to anyone with a heart who knows direction is about more than camera moves.&quot; In 2009 the film was ranked at No. 36 on the list of the &quot;Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. In 2012, Spanish film director José Luis Guerín, as well as two other directors, listed the film as one of the greatest ever made.

<doc id="1059674" wikidata="Q1127420" url="?curid=1059674" title="Laika Come Home">
<text>Laika Come Home is a remix album by British virtual band Gorillaz, released in July 2002. Unlike a typical remix album, it is done by just one group, Spacemonkeyz. It contains most of the songs from Gorillaz&#x27; first album, &quot;Gorillaz&quot;, but remixed in dub and reggae style. The album features Terry Hall, U Brown, Earl Sixteen and 2-D. One single, &quot;Lil&#x27; Dub Chefin&#x27;&quot;, was released from the album on 22 July 2002, with moderate success. The limited edition was packed in digipak, featuring two hidden tracks. In 2004, the album was packaged with 2001&#x27;s &quot;Gorillaz&quot; in a box set as part of EMI&#x27;s &quot;2CD Originals&quot; collection. The album&#x27;s title is a reference to Laika, the Soviet space dog, and the film &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;. The album contains mixes of every song on the original album except &quot;Double Bass&quot;, &quot;Latin Simone (¿Que Pasa Contigo?)&quot;, and &quot;Rock the House&quot;.

==Background==
The Spacemonkeyz appear to be first referenced before the album in the &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; video. During the video, in the background, a poster can be seen with three pictures of monkeys with spacesuits and the caption &quot;Laugh now but one day we&#x27;ll be in charge&quot;. The artwork is a famous piece of artwork by Banksy, the visual artist who worked with Damon Albarn for Think Tank&#x27;s artwork and &quot;Demon Days&quot; producer Danger Mouse in an attack against Paris Hilton. Before the release of the album, the remix of &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; (&quot;Bañana Baby&quot;) was released on the &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; single in February 2002.

<text>John Colicos (December 10, 1928 – March 6, 2000) was a Canadian actor. He performed on stage and television in the United States and Canada.

==Early life==
Colicos was born in Toronto, Ontario, to a Greek father and a Canadian mother.

==Career==
Colicos began his acting career with the Canadian Art Theatre,&lt;ref name=&quot;canadiantheatre/Colicos,John&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; before the Montreal Repertory Theatre, later winning a Dominion Drama Festival award.&lt;ref name=&quot;theglobeandmail/4161247&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Colicos was named best actor at the 1951 Dominion Drama Festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia/john-colicos&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Colicos worked briefly at the Old Vic company in England.

Colicos worked CBC Radio, with Andrew Allen, and later appeared in CBC dramas. 

In 1957 he appeared in &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in New York City and in 1963 he appeared in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. His other New York theatre credits are &quot;King Lear&quot; (1956), &quot;The Devils&quot; (1965–1966), &quot;Serjeant Musgrave&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1966), and &quot;Soldiers&quot; (1968). Colicos&#x27; skill in acting resulted in his being chosen to play the title role in a memorable and first-ever production of &quot;King Lear&quot; (1964) at the Stratford Festival.

He appeared as Monks in a television version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; for the &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot; series in 1959. He also gave memorable performances in 1966 on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;; as the unscrupulous Thomas Cromwell in the 1969 movie version of &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;; and as the governor of Umakran in the episode &quot;The Goddess Calabra&quot; from the 1973 TV show &quot;The Starlost&quot;.

On American television, he established himself as a science-fiction villain icon, portraying the first Klingon ever seen in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Commander Kor in the &quot;Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot; (1967). Colicos worked with Gene Roddenberry designing the look the Klingons have on &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966). Budget constraints prevented the extensive makeup the Klingons were supposed to have so Colicos suggested they have a leathery Genghis Khan look, dark skin and hair. He also portrayed Lord Baltar in the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; movie and television series. Over a quarter-century after his initial appearance in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Colicos reprised his role as the 140-year-old Kor in three episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, telecast between 1994 and 1998.

Aside from his science-fiction roles, Colicos also appeared numerous times in episodic television from the 1960s onwards, including the portrayal of the villain on three episodes of &quot;&quot;. He appeared in four episodes of the CBC docu-drama &quot;The National Dream&quot; as the &quot;railway general&quot; William Cornelius Van Horne and appeared in seven episodes of &quot;Mannix&quot;. The last person shot and killed in the television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1955–1975) was Judge Flood, played by Colicos in episode 631, &quot;Hard Labor&quot;.

Several years after his &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; tenure, Colicos again ventured into science fiction. In August and September 1981, he portrayed Mikkos Cassadine, a demented, power-mad businessman bent on freezing the world, on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He was also the voice of the X-Men villain Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur (1993–1995) in the Fox Kids animated &quot;X-Men&quot; television series in the nineties, and twice played rogue alien Quinn in the first season (1988–1989) of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.

In 1982 he ventured into educational TV with TVOntario&#x27;s award-winning production of &quot;Prophecy with John Colicos&quot;. The writer/director, Dr. Robert Gardner, recalled his initial meeting with the actor: &quot;I had seen him scores of times in movies and television and I was very nervous. In truth, though, he was a joy to work with. Once he sensed that you were prepared he was thoroughly professional. His presence in the ninety-minute production was the main reason it went on to win the prestigious Gold Medal at the Atlanta International Film Festival.&quot;

He appeared in TV commercials during the 1990s for America&#x27;s Best Contacts &amp; Eyeglasses. Colicos&#x27; final acting appearance was his reprise of Count Baltar in the concept demonstration trailer &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming&quot;, exhibited at many science fiction conventions in 1999.

==Personal life==
Colicos wed Mona McHenry in 1956 and divorced in 1981. They had two sons, Nicolas (also an actor) and Edmund. Colicos died in Toronto on March 6, 2000, at the age of 71, after a series of heart attacks.

<doc id="1059683" wikidata="Q2085376" url="?curid=1059683" title="Atlantic Time Zone">
<text>The Atlantic Time Zone is a geographical region that keeps standard time—called Atlantic Standard Time (AST)—by subtracting four hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), resulting in UTC−04:00. AST is observed in parts of North America including several Caribbean islands. During part of the year, some portions of the zone observe daylight saving time, referred to as Atlantic Daylight Time (ADT), by moving their clocks forward one hour to UTC−03:00. The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the 60th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory.

In Canada, the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are in this zone, though legally they calculate time specifically as an offset of four hours from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT–4) rather than from UTC. Small portions of Quebec (eastern Côte-Nord and the Magdalen Islands) also observe Atlantic Time. Officially, the entirety of Newfoundland and Labrador observes Newfoundland Standard Time, but in practice Atlantic Time is used in most of Labrador.

No part of the continental United States uses Atlantic Time, although it is used by the territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the 2010s, several U.S. states considered legislation to move from the Eastern Time Zone to Atlantic Standard Time. Any changes must be approved by the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Congress before taking effect.

The United States National Hurricane Center&#x27;s official advisories typically report AST and UTC when tracking storms in the Caribbean that threaten the U.S., which may confuse the mainland public not familiar with the time zone designation (although AST is equivalent to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) for most of the Atlantic hurricane season).

==U.S. states considering a change to Atlantic Standard Time==

All six of the New England states in the northeastern U.S., currently in the Eastern Time Zone (with daylight saving time), have considered legislation to shift to UTC−04:00, equivalent to Atlantic Standard Time (with no observance of daylight saving time) or Eastern Daylight Time. Virtually all of this region is west of the theoretical western border of the zone at 67.5°W; only a small part of Maine lies east of that meridian. A Massachusetts commission concluded in 2017 that the benefits of changing to Atlantic Standard Time year-round would outweigh the disadvantages, provided that a majority of northeastern states make the same change. In May 2017, the Maine Senate approved a change to AST, on the condition that there would be a referendum, and that Massachusetts and New Hampshire decided to make the same switch. Also in 2017, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill in favor of a regional change, but this was voted down by the state&#x27;s Senate. Similar bills have been put forward in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

In 2018, Florida enacted into law the &quot;Sunshine Protection Act&quot;, under which the state would observe daylight saving time year-round. Most of the state would permanently keep Eastern Daylight Time, which is equivalent to Atlantic Standard Time; the state&#x27;s panhandle region would move to year-round Central Daylight Time. However, the change cannot take effect until it is passed into federal law by the United States Congress.

On March 15, 2022, the United States Senate voted unanimously to advance a federal version of the &quot;Sunshine Protection&quot; legislation from Florida, also called the &quot;Sunshine Protection Act&quot;, to the United States House of Representatives; the bill was not brought to a vote in the House. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate in 2023.

<text>The Douglas XB-31 (Douglas Model 332) was the design submitted by Douglas after the request by the United States Army Air Forces for a very heavy bomber aircraft, the same request that led to the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Lockheed XB-30, and Consolidated B-32 Dominator.

==Design and development==
Around 1938, United States Army General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, the head of the US Army Air Corps (USAAC), was growing alarmed at the possibility of war in Europe and in the Pacific. Hoping to be prepared for the long-term requirements of the Air Force, Arnold created a special committee chaired by Brigadier General W. G. Kilner; one of its members was Charles Lindbergh. The Douglas firm at the time was working on an even larger, 212 foot (64.6 meter) wingspan four-engined strategic bomber prototype airframe, the Douglas XB-19, that made her maiden flight in late June 1941. 

After a tour of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bases, Lindbergh became convinced that Nazi Germany was far ahead of other European nations. In a report in 1939, the committee made a number of recommendations, including development of new long-range heavy bombers. When war broke out in Europe, Arnold requested design studies from several companies on a Very Long-Range bomber capable of travelling 5,000 miles (8,000 km). Approval was granted on 2 December 1939.

Throughout 1939 and 1940 Douglas investigated designs of the Model 332 with different powerplants (Wright R-2600, Pratt and Whitney R-2800, Wright R-2160, Wright R-3350). All were designed to have roughly same operating range, with variations in the projected service ceiling.

The XB-31 design was rejected in favor of the B-29 and B-32 (along with the XB-30) because the USAAC found the B-29 superior to the Douglas and Lockheed designs.

<doc id="1059688" wikidata="Q618118" url="?curid=1059688" title="Good Morning (1959 film)">
<text>is a 1959 Japanese comedy film co-written and directed by Yasujirō Ozu. It is a loose remake of his own 1932 silent film &quot;I Was Born, But...&quot;, and is Ozu&#x27;s second film in color.

==Plot==
The film takes place in suburban Tokyo, and begins with a group of boy students going home.

The film steers into a subplot concerning the local women&#x27;s club monthly dues. Everyone in the neighborhood club believes that Mrs Hayashi, the treasurer, has given the dues to the chairwoman, Mrs Haraguchi, but Mrs Haraguchi denies it. They gossip amongst themselves who could have taken the money, and speculate that Mrs Haraguchi could have used the money to buy for herself a new washing machine. Later Mrs Haraguchi confronts Mrs Hayashi for starting the rumor and ruining her reputation, but Mrs Hayashi states that she &quot;has&quot; indeed handed the dues money to Haraguchi&#x27;s mother. Only later does Mrs Haraguchi realize it was her mistake (her mother being quite senile and forgetful), and she goes to apologize.

The boys are all attracted to a neighbor&#x27;s house because they have a television set, where they can watch their favorite sumo wrestling matches. (At the time of the film&#x27;s release in Japan, the medium was rapidly gaining popularity.) However, their conservative parents forbid them to visit their bohemian neighbors because the wife is thought to be a cabaret singer.

As a result of this, the young boys of the Hayashi family, Minoru and Isamu, pressure their mother to buy them a television set, but their mother refuses. When their father learns of it, he asks the boys to keep quiet when they kick a tantrum. Minoru throws an anger fit, and states that adults always engage in pointless niceties like &quot;good morning&quot; and refuse to say exactly what they mean. Back in their room, Minoru and Isamu decide on a silence strike against all adults. The first neighbor to bear the brunt of this snub is Mrs Haraguchi.

Mrs Haraguchi, angered by this snub, speculates it is Mrs Hayashi who instigates this in revenge over their earlier misunderstanding, and tells this to busybody Mrs. Tomizawa. Soon, everybody thinks Mrs Hayashi is a petty, vengeful person, and are all queueing up to return their loaned items to her.

Minoru and Isamu continue their strike in school, and even against their English tutor. Finally, their schoolteacher visits to find the root of their silence. The two boys run off from home with a pot of rice due to hunger, but are caught by a passing policeman. They disappear for hours into the evening, until their English tutor finds them outside a station watching television.

At the end of the film, the boys find out their parents have indeed purchased a television set to support a neighbour in his new job as a salesman. Jubilant, they stop their strike at once. Their English tutor and their aunt appear to be starting a fresh romance.

==Style==
Despite Ozu&#x27;s reputation in the West as an austere and refined director, &quot;Good Morning&quot; does not shy away from depicting many of the neighborhood boys&#x27; flatulence jokes.

==Reception==
&quot;Good Morning&quot; has an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote about the film &quot;Yasujiro Ozu’s poised images convey a bitterly ironic, scathingly radical rejection of Japanese codes of self-restraint and silence.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised the film describing it as &quot;Perhaps the most delightful of Yasujiro Ozu&#x27;s late comedies&quot;. In 2009 the film was ranked at No. 36 on the list of the &quot;Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine kinema Junpo.

===Home media===
In 2011, the BFI released a Region 2 Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD). Included with this release is a standard definition presentation of &quot;I Was Born, But...&quot;.

In 2017, Criterion re-released &quot;Good Morning&quot; in a Region 1 Blu-ray. The film received a 4k digital restoration for this release and is packaged alongside &quot;I Was Born, But...&quot; and a fragment of &quot;A Straightforward Boy&quot;.

<doc id="1059701" wikidata="Q528095" url="?curid=1059701" title="Superman III">
<text>Superman III is a 1983 superhero film directed by Richard Lester from a screenplay by David Newman and Leslie Newman based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the third installment in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series and the sequel to &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980). The film stars Christopher Reeve, Richard Pryor, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Annette O&#x27;Toole, Annie Ross, Pamela Stephenson, Robert Vaughn, and Margot Kidder.

The film proved less successful than the first two films both financially and critically. A sequel, &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot;, was released in July 1987.

==Plot==
The conglomerate Webscoe Industries hires computer programmer Gus Gorman, who secretly embezzles $85,000 from the company payroll. Gus comes to the attention of Webscoe&#x27;s CEO, Ross Webster. A cunning billionaire fixated on using technology for financial domination, Webster sees Gus’s skills as a valuable asset. With the help of his stern sister Vera and his mistress Lorelei Ambrosia, he blackmails Gus into aiding his schemes.

Superman extinguishes a fire in a chemical plant, and, as Clark Kent, he returns to Smallville for his high school reunion. Clark reconnects with childhood friend Lana Lang, who has a young son named Ricky. Superman later saves Ricky from a combine harvester accident during a picnic with Lana.

Webster orders Gus to use the weather satellite &#x27;Vulcan&#x27; to create a storm that destroys coffee crops in Colombia, aiming to corner the market. Gus complies, but Superman neutralizes the storm. Recognizing Superman as a threat, Webster orders Gus to synthesize Kryptonite.

Lana invites Superman to Ricky&#x27;s birthday party. Gus and Vera infiltrate the party and give Superman the synthetic Kryptonite, which corrupts him and causes him to commit acts of vandalism such as straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa and blowing out the Olympic Flame.

Gus proposes building a supercomputer for Webster in exchange for creating an energy crisis by redirecting oil tankers. Lorelei seduces Superman and manipulates him into causing an oil spill. Superman suffers a nervous breakdown and splits into two beings: the corrupted Superman and Clark Kent. The two fight, and Clark defeats the corrupted Superman. Superman then repairs the damage of the oil spill. 

After surviving exploding rockets and a missile, he confronts Webster, Vera, and Lorelei in the &quot;Ultimate Computer&quot;. The computer becomes self-aware, and defends itself against attempts to disable it as it transforms Vera into a cyborg. Vera attacks Webster and Lorelei with energy beams that immobilize them. Superman retrieves acid from the chemical plant, destroying the Ultimate Computer.

Gus starts anew in West Virginia. Meanwhile, Clark visits Lana in Metropolis, where she begins working as a secretary for Perry White. Lois Lane returns from Bermuda with an exposé on corruption, and Superman restores the Leaning Tower of Pisa before flying into space.

==Cast==

* Christopher Reeve as Superman: After discovering his origins, he makes it his mission to help the Earth. Superman battles megalomaniac Ross Webster, who attempts to control the global coffee and oil supply. 
* Richard Pryor as Gus Gorman: A bumbling computer genius who works for Ross Webster and becomes linked with his plan to destroy Superman.
* Jackie Cooper as Perry White: The editor of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.
* Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen: A photographer for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.
* Annette O&#x27;Toole as Lana Lang: Clark&#x27;s high school friend who reconciles with Clark during their high school reunion. O&#x27;Toole later portrayed Martha Kent on the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;.

* Robert Vaughn as Ross Webster: A villainous, wealthy industrialist and philanthropist. After Superman prevents him from taking over the world&#x27;s coffee supply, Ross is determined to destroy Superman before he can stop his plan to control the world&#x27;s oil supply. He is an original character created for the movie.
* Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A reporter at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; who has history with both Clark Kent and Superman. She is on vacation in Bermuda.
* Gavan O&#x27;Herlihy as Brad Wilson: Lana&#x27;s ex-boyfriend and Clark&#x27;s high school bully; now an alcoholic security guard.

Frank Oz had a cameo as a surgeon, but the scene was deleted from the final cut, although it was later included in the TV extended version of the film. Shane Rimmer appears as a state police officer. Pamela Mandell, who played a diner waitress in the same film, appears as the hapless wife of a &quot;Daily Planet&quot; sweepstakes winner. Aaron Smolinski, who played young Clark Kent in &quot;Superman&quot;, appears as the boy next to the phone booth that Clark uses to change into Superman. He also would later appear in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; as a communications officer.

==Production==

===Development===
Richard Donner confirmed that he had been interested in writing at least two more &quot;Superman&quot; films which he intended Tom Mankiewicz to direct, and use Brainiac as the villain of the third film. Donner departed the series during the production of &quot;Superman II&quot;. The film was announced at the 33rd Cannes Film Festival in May 1980. In December 1980, producer Ilya Salkind wrote a treatment for this film that included Brainiac, Mister Mxyzptlk and Supergirl. The treatment was released online in 2007. The Mister Mxyzptlk portrayed in the outline varies from his comic counterpart as he uses his abilities to cause chaos. Dudley Moore was the first choice to play the role. In the treatment, Brainiac was from Colu and had discovered Supergirl in the same way that Superman was found by the Kents. Brainiac is portrayed as a surrogate father to Supergirl and eventually fell in love with his &quot;daughter&quot; who did not reciprocate his feelings, as she had fallen in love with Superman. Brainiac retaliates by using a personality machine to corrupt and manipulate Superman. The climax of the film would have seen Superman, Supergirl, Jimmy Olsen, Lana Lang and Brainiac time travel to the Middle Ages for a final battle against Brainiac. After defeating him and leaving Brainiac behind, Superman and Supergirl would have married at the end of &quot;Superman III&quot; or in &quot;Superman IV&quot;. The treatment was rejected as being too complex and expensive to shoot. Because of the high budgets required for the series, the Salkinds considered selling the rights to the series to Dino De Laurentiis. The significance of computers, the corruption of Superman, and the splitting of Superman into good and evil would be used in the final film. The film was originally intended to be titled &quot;Superman vs. Superman&quot;, but was retitled after the producers of &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; threatened a lawsuit.

===Casting===
Both Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder are said to have been angry with the way the Salkinds treated &quot;Superman&quot; director Richard Donner, with Hackman retaliating by refusing to reprise the role of Lex Luthor. After Margot Kidder publicly criticized the Salkinds for their treatment of Donner, the producers reportedly punished Kidder by reducing her role in &quot;Superman III&quot; to a brief appearance. Hackman later denied such claims, stating that he had been busy with other movies and that making Luthor a constant villain would be similar to horror movie sequels where a serial killer keeps coming back. Hackman would reprise his role as Lex Luthor in &quot;Superman IV&quot; which the Salkinds had no involvement in. In the commentary for the 2006 DVD release of &quot;Superman III&quot;, Ilya Salkind denied any negative feelings between Margot Kidder and his production team and denied the claim that her part was cut for retaliation. Instead, he said the creative team decided to pursue a different direction for a love interest for Superman, believing the Lois and Clark relationship had been overdone in the first two films. With the choice to give a more prominent role to Lana Lang, the role of Lois was reduced for story reasons. Salkind also denied the reports about Hackman being upset with him, stating that he was unable to return because of other film commitments.

Though Christopher Reeve had been contracted for seven films as Superman, he engaged a lawyer to renegotiate his contract prior to production. Producer Pierre Spengler described the process of securing Reeve&#x27;s return as contentious, though Ilya Salkind recalls that Reeve approved of the &quot;Superman III&quot; script and was more than willing to reprise his role.

After an appearance by Richard Pryor on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, telling Johnny Carson how much he enjoyed seeing &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot;, and Pryor jokingly stated his desire to appear in a future Superman installment, the Salkinds were eager to cast him in a prominent role in the third film, using the success of Pryor in the films &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Toy&quot;. Pryor accepted a $5 million salary. Following the release of the film, Pryor signed a five-year contract with Columbia Pictures for $40 million.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on June 21, 1982. Most of the interior scenes were shot at Pinewood Studios outside London. The junkyard scene was filmed on the backlot of Pinewood. The coal mine scene was filmed at Battersea Power Station. Most exteriors were filmed in Calgary because of tax breaks for film companies. Superman&#x27;s drinking was filmed at the St. Louis Hotel in Downtown East Village, Calgary, while other scenes such as the slapstick comedy opening were shot several blocks to the west. While the supercomputer set was created on the 007 Stage, exteriors were shot at Glen Canyon in Utah.

===Effects and animation===
The film includes the same special effects team from the first two films.
Atari created the video game computer animation for the missile scene.

==Music==

As with the previous sequel, the musical score was composed and conducted by Ken Thorne, using the Superman theme and most other themes from the first film composed by John Williams. Giorgio Moroder was hired to create songs for the film.

The appearance of the cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s song &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, by the Beatles acts as an indirect reference and connection with &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!;&quot; both were also directed by Richard Lester.

==Release==

===Theatrical===
&quot;Superman III&quot; was screened at the Uptown Theater in Washington D.C., on June 12, 1983, and premiered in New York on June 14, 1983, at Cinema I. It was released on June 17, 1983, in the United States and July 19, 1983, in the United Kingdom.

===Marketing===
William Kotzwinkle wrote a novelization of the film published by Warner Books in the US and by Arrow Books in the UK; Severn House published a British hardcover edition. Kotzwinkle thought the novelization &quot;a delight the world has yet to find out about.&quot; However, writing in &quot;Voice of Youth Advocates&quot;, Roberta Rogow hoped this would be the final Superman film and said, &quot;Kotzwinkle has done his usual good job of translating the screenplay into a novel, but there are nasty undertones to the film, and there are nasty undertones to the novel as well. Adults may enjoy the novel on its own merits, as a black comedy of sorts, but it&#x27;s not written for kids, and most of the under-15 crowd will either be puzzled or revolted by Kotzwinkle&#x27;s dour humor.&quot;

===Extended television edition===
Like the previous films, a separate extended edition was produced and aired on ABC. The opening credits were in outer space, featuring an edited version of the film&#x27;s end-credit theme music, serving as an opening theme. This is followed by a number of scenes, including additional dialogue but not added in any of the official VHS, DVD or Blu-ray cuts of the film. The Deluxe Edition of &quot;Superman III&quot;, released in 2006 along with the DVD release of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, included these scenes in the extra features section as deleted scenes.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Superman III&quot; grossed $60 million at the United States box office, and $20.2 million internationally, for a total of $80.2 million worldwide. The film was the 12th-highest-grossing film of 1983 in North America.

===Critical response===
&quot;Superman III&quot; holds a 29% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews. The critical consensus reads &quot;When not overusing sight gags, slapstick and Richard Pryor, &quot;Superman III&quot; resorts to plot points rehashed from the previous &quot;Superman&quot; flicks.&quot; The film has a Metacritic rating of 44, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; from 13 professional reviewers.

Film critic Leonard Maltin said that &quot;Superman III&quot; was an &quot;appalling sequel that trashed everything that Superman was about for the sake of cheap laughs and a co-starring role for Richard Pryor&quot;. The film was nominated for two Razzie Awards including Worst Supporting Actor for Richard Pryor and Worst Musical Score for Giorgio Moroder. Audiences also saw Robert Vaughn&#x27;s villainous Ross Webster as a weak replacement for Lex Luthor.

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Superman III&quot; in &quot;Ares&quot; magazine #16 and commented that &quot;compared to the first film in this series, everything about &quot;Superman III&quot; is a joke, a harsh cruel joke played on all the people who wanted to see more of the Superman they saw a few years ago.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Superman III&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;What ultimately spoils the fun in &quot;Superman III&quot; is not the incoherent story or even the technophobia. It is simply overloaded—too many ideas, too many gadgets, too many stars (Pamela Stephenson is completely wasted in a part which would have been too dumb for Goldie Hawn). The wiring all comes loose at the end; an anticlimax, and a rushed one at that.&quot;

Fans of the Superman series placed a great deal of the blame on director Richard Lester. Lester made a number of comedies in the 1960s—including the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;—before being hired by the Salkinds in the 1970s for their successful &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; series, as well as &quot;Superman II&quot; which, although better received, was also criticized for unnecessary sight gags and slapstick. Lester broke tradition by setting the opening credits for &quot;Superman III&quot; during a prolonged slapstick sequence rather than in outer space.

The film&#x27;s screenplay, by David and Leslie Newman, was also criticized. When Richard Donner was hired to direct the first two films, he rejected the Newman scripts and hired Tom Mankiewicz for heavy rewrites. Since Donner and Mankiewicz were no longer attached, the Salkinds were able to bring their version of &quot;Superman&quot; to the screen and once again hired the Newmans for writing duties. 
The performance of Reeve as the corrupted Superman received praise, particularly the junkyard battle between the dark Superman and Clark Kent.

<text>Dale Crover (born October 23, 1967) is an American rock musician. Crover is best known as the drummer for Melvins and has also been the drummer for Men of Porn, Shrinebuilder, Crystal Fairy and, for a brief time, Nirvana. He is also guitarist and vocalist for Altamont. He has toured with Fantômas (filling in for Dave Lombardo), Off!, and Redd Kross. In 2016, Rolling Stone listed him as the 69th greatest drummer of all time.

== Biography ==
Melvins recruited Crover on drums in 1984 from an Iron Maiden cover band, following original drummer Mike Dillard&#x27;s departure. Crover has been one of the two constant members of the Melvins, along with frontman Buzz Osborne, and is the only band member besides Osborne to appear on all their studio albums. In late 1985, Crover played bass in Fecal Matter, a band he formed with Kurt Cobain and Greg Hokanson. After Hokanson left the band, Cobain and Crover recorded &quot;Illiteracy Will Prevail&quot; on a 4-track on Easter 1986 at Cobain&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s home in Burien, Washington. Crover played bass and drums on the demo. &quot;Spank Thru&quot; from this demo appears on the Nirvana album &quot;&quot;. Fecal Matter disbanded in 1986.

Crover drummed on Nirvana&#x27;s ten-song demo recorded January 23, 1988, at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle. Nine of these songs have been officially released:
* &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot;, &quot;Paper Cuts&quot;, and &quot;Downer&quot; – &quot;Bleach&quot;
* &quot;Beeswax&quot;, &quot;Downer&quot;, &quot;Hairspray Queen&quot;, &quot;Mexican Seafood&quot;, and &quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot; – &quot;Incesticide&quot;
* &quot;If You Must&quot; and &quot;Pen Cap Chew&quot; – &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;

The original incarnation of Nirvana including Crover on drums played a 14-song show in Tacoma, Washington, on the night of the same day that they did the demo session. Three cuts from the show – &quot;Downer&quot;, &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot;, and &quot;Raunchola&quot;/&quot;Moby Dick&quot; – appear on &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;. Later in 1988, Crover and Melvins&#x27; bandmate Buzz Osborne relocated to San Francisco, California. Not wanting to break the Melvins up, Cobain asked Buzz for recommendations on who he should recruit as his drummer and it was Osborne who referred Cobain to Dave Grohl, drummer of the hardcore band Scream at that time, commenting of Grohl that, &quot;He&#x27;s almost as good as Dale Crover.&quot; Crover briefly rejoined Nirvana during a short west-coast tour with Sonic Youth in August 1990. In April 1991, Crover played drums on a demo version of &quot;Drain You&quot; with Cobain on guitar and vocals and Dave Grohl on bass guitar. The track appears on &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;.

In the years 1993 and 1994 the Melvins played a tour visiting every state in the contiguous United States, and released their first record on a major label (Atlantic) which had been nominally produced by Kurt Cobain, toured with Nirvana on the first leg of their world tour for In Utero, and then played a later leg of the tour that ended up including the last shows that Nirvana ever played. The Melvins opened for Nirvana at what turned out to be their final show in Munich after Cobain&#x27;s overdose in Rome and shortly before his death. Prior to Cobain&#x27;s departure for what wound up to be a short stint in rehab, the Melvins had several other shows scheduled to open for Nirvana in Europe. When these shows were canceled, the Melvins &#x27;took their Nirvana money&#x27; to book studio time in London. They recorded two of their best-remembered albums in one week: &quot;Stoner Witch&quot;, and &quot;Prick&quot;. The album released as &quot;Prick&quot; was originally intended to appear under the title &quot;Kurdt Cobain&quot;, but this idea was shelved after Cobain&#x27;s suicide. During the same year, Crover founded the band Altamont with Joey Osbourne and Dan Southwick of Acid King. He produced and performed additional vocals on Acid King&#x27;s début release that year. During this time he was also married to Acid King&#x27;s frontwoman Lori S., but they divorced. When Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014, although not officially inducted with the band, Crover was singled out for his work with them during Crover&#x27;s successor Dave Grohl&#x27;s acceptance speech. A high proportion of the most substantive and historically infromative entries in Kurt Cobain&#x27;s published journals consist of unfinished letters that he started writing to Dale Crover.

It may be significant to point out that after Cobain&#x27;s death and the waning of grunge rock&#x27;s centrality in the popular culture of the 1990&#x27;s, Crover&#x27;s career with Buzz Osborne in the Melvins, though they started playing together a decade earlier in 1984, had still scarcely begun in 1994. The volume and influence of the music that they produced thereafter has only grown over time. Since 1994, the Melvins have released nearly thirty studio albums and twenty EPs while continuing to tour relentlessly since that time. They played with Nine Inch Nails on the Downward Spiral tour in 1995, and on a later tour with Tool they both opened and played as additional personnel with the headlining band after opening for them. They toured with Faith No More and with the legendary, seminal punk musician Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys while also putting out a collaborative album with him, and playing guitars and drums during the Dead Kennedys sets during the tour. Their collaboration with Lustmord on the Pigs of the Roman Empire is perhaps lesser known, but much cherished by fans. Crover is credited as the drummer on most of the tracks on Mike Patton&#x27;s Peeping Tom project from 2006. The Melvins also play with Patton on the Fantomas records and have contributed to various other Patton projects. Crover is credited on nearly 400 releases according to &quot;Discogs&quot;.

He has released three LPs as a solo artist including&quot;The Fickle Finger of Fate&quot; and &quot;Rat-a-Tat-Tat.&quot; In the summer of 2024, he released &quot;Glossolalia&quot; on Joyful Noise Recordings with musical guests including Tom Waits, Ty Segall, Kim Thayil and Rob Crow. Crover has also released a number of other one-off projects at Joyful Noise including the percussion project Hew Time, which enlisted the drummers Coady Willis (of Big Business) and Joe Plummer (of Modest Mouse).

== Appearances ==
Dale Crover made an appearance in Neil Young&#x27;s video &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; playing Neil Young. This was largely due to his physical resemblance to the younger Young.

Cartoon versions of Crover and bandmate Osborne appear in an episode of &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot; as well.

<text>Alexander Bielaski (August 1, 1811 – November 7, 1861) was an engineer and Union Army officer who was killed during the Battle of Belmont during the American Civil War. Born in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire or elsewhere in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Bielaski fought under Polish officer Henryk Dembiński during the November Uprising against the Russians in 1831. After suffering a disfiguring wound at the Battle of Grochów, he immigrated to the United States in 1832 and worked as an engineer and surveyor, including doing work for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Illinois Central Railroad. Bielaski was a friend of Abraham Lincoln, who gave him a commission in the Union Army when the American Civil War broke out in 1861. Serving as an aide to Brigadier General John A. McClernand, Bielaski was killed while leading the 27th Illinois Infantry Regiment in a charge at the Battle of Belmont.

==Early life==
Alexander Bielaski was born either in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire or elsewhere in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, on August 1, 1811. The modern historian Nathaniel C. Hughes describes him as Polish. Bielaski was trained as a topographical engineer in a Russian military academy at St. Petersburg and entered the Imperial Russian Army as an engineer. He joined the November Uprising, a revolt against the Russian Empire, in 1831. He served in a Polish army under Henryk Dembiński, under whom he once commanded a 300-man rear guard; his unit was wrecked by a Russian attack and Bielaski only returned to Polish headquarters with a single man. He was later shot in the mouth while fighting in the Battle of Grochów. The wound was disfiguring and destroyed several teeth. After the wound healed, Bielaski moved to Paris to work for the French government before immigrating to the United States in 1832.

Bielaski entered the United States at Portland, Maine, and entered the railroad industry. When he first reached the United States, he spoke no English, but some French; he eventually gained a proficiency in the use of English. After serving as a surveyor and engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, he traveled to Florida for surveying work in 1835 before moving to Springfield, Illinois, in 1837. That same year, Bielaski befriended Abraham Lincoln. After surveying the Illinois Central Railroad, he was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1841. In July 1842, he married Springfield resident Mary Ann Carey, before moving to Mexico City in November 1842. Bielaski spent eighteen months in Mexico, where he was employed as an engineer and declined an offer of Mexican citizenship made by Santa Anna.

Returning to Illinois, he farmed for two years, but accepted an offer of employment with the United States General Land Office in 1845. Bielaski moved to Washington, D. C. for the position; by 1853, he had been promoted to a well-compensated position as a principal draftsman. After Lincoln was elected president, he would spend evenings sitting with Bielaski on the latter&#x27;s porch. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Lincoln offered Bielaski a captain&#x27;s commission to serve in the Union Army. Bielaski was initially reluctant to accept the offer because of his family, but was convinced to join the army by Lincoln. After joining the Union Army, he became an aide-de-camp for Brigadier General John A. McClernand.

==American Civil War==
While serving as an aide to McClernand, Bielaski was concerned about the armament of the Union troops. McClernand&#x27;s men were largely armed with flintlock muskets retooled to use percussion caps. Bielaski felt that the Union cavalry should be armed with lances, as were French and Austrian armies as well as the Cossacks. Early in the war, the Confederate States Army controlled the towns of Columbus, Kentucky, and Belmont, Missouri on opposite sides of the Mississippi River, giving them control of the river. Union Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant wanted to contain the Confederate positions, and boarded men onto transport vessels on November 6, 1861. After learning that the Confederates were planning an offensive, Grant ordered the transports to attack the Confederate camp in Belmont. A position near Belmont was reached on November 7, and the Union troops began moving to attack the Confederates, who were commanded by Brigiader General Gideon Pillow.

While most of Grant&#x27;s force encountered Pillow&#x27;s Confederates, McClernand had detached the 27th Illinois Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Napoleon Buford, to take a road to the Union right, and be in position on the other side of a slough from the main Union line. Bielaski accompanied Buford and the 27th Illinois Infantry during the movement. During the march, Buford learned that by abandoning his original directions and heading further down the road, he could strike the Confederates in the rear of their position. Buford decided to make the movement against the Confederate rear; the historian Nathaniel Cheairs Hughes believes that Bielaski supported the decision. After turning onto a plank road and later making another turn, the 27th Illinois Infantry Regiment reached a point within of the Confederate camp, where the trees surrounding the camp had been cut down to form abatis. Bielaski had helped make the decisions about which roads to take during the movement.

The 27th Illinois Infantry then charged the Confederate line, which was held in that sector by Company A of the 13th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. Confederate fire initially disrupted the Union line, but Bielaski rallied the men and took part in the charge. He was first shot in the hand, and was then forced to dismount from his horse after the animal was wounded in the neck. After firing several shots with a musket he picked up on the field, Bielaski grabbed the regiment&#x27;s battle flag and led the charge. Carrying the flag made him a target, though, and he was killed during the attack. Hughes states that he was killed by a bullet to the head, while Joseph A. Wytrwał, writing for &quot;Polish American Studies&quot;, attributes his death to a cannonball. A contemporary newspaper report stated that he &quot;fell mutilated by cannon bullets&quot;. Union Colonel John A. Logan stated &quot;a braver man never fell on the field of battle&quot; when writing about Bielaski&#x27;s death in his action report, and McClernand also noted his bravery. Grant&#x27;s men were initially able to capture the Confederate camp, but Pillow received reinforcements from Columbus and counterattacked, driving the Union soldiers from the field. Bielaski was buried in a mass grave until his remains were disinterred in 1864 and transferred to the Mound City National Cemetery in Illinois. His grave is marked as &quot;Unknown Soldier, killed at the Battle of Belmont&quot;.

==Family==
Bielaski was the father of Oscar Bielaski, who was one of the first Polish-Americans to play professional baseball in the United States. Through his other son, Alexander, Bielaski was the grandfather of A. Bruce Bielaski, who served as director of what became the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1912 to 1919. Ruth Shipley was A. Bruce&#x27;s sister and Bielaski&#x27;s granddaughter; she served as the head of the passport division of the United States Department of State for 27 years.

<doc id="1059716" wikidata="Q1615696" url="?curid=1059716" title="Monsignor (film)">
<text>Monsignor is a 1982 American drama film directed by Frank Perry about a Roman Catholic priest&#x27;s rise through the ranks of the Vatican, during and after World War II. Along the way, he involves the Vatican in the black marketeering operations of a Mafia don, and has an affair with a woman in the postulant stage of becoming a nun. He eventually repents and returns to his faith, attempting to make right the things he has done wrong. The cast includes Christopher Reeve, Geneviève Bujold, Fernando Rey, Jason Miller, Joseph Cortese, Adolfo Celi, and Leonardo Cimino.

The film was not well received by critics and performed poorly at the box office; Reeve later blamed this on poor editing. Supporting actors Miller and Rey were singled out for their strong performances. The film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Musical Score, the only Razzie nomination John Williams ever received in his career to date.

The filming location was entirely in Rome, Italy.

==Plot==

With the Vatican having financial difficulties during World War II, a young priest from America is sent for, recommended because of his accounting skill. He has already broken the rules, for his first assignment after ordination, is a military chaplain. There he ministers to a dying soldier and then takes the dead soldier&#x27;s position as a machine gunner and destroys a squadron of advancing German troops. This action of a priest killing in combat gets him removed from that position, and he is then sent to the Vatican, with his knowledge of business and accounting.

Father John Flaherty does indeed have a good head for figures, but also believes in any means to an end. To raise money for the church, he is willing to enter into a black market operation with the Mafia, selling cartons of cigarettes by the tens of thousands for a percentage of the take.

The priest&#x27;s morals are strained further when he develops a romantic interest in Clara, a young nun who is having a crisis of faith. They begin an affair, but Flaherty does not confess to her his true identity. One day during a papal ceremony, Clara catches sight of Flaherty in his clerical robes. Her love and trust are shattered.

Flaherty&#x27;s methods may be overlooked, but his success at raising funds is appreciated by some of his superiors as he rises to become a monsignor, then a cardinal. When an ill-advised stock investment costs the Vatican millions, however, Flaherty must pay the price for his deeds.

In 1983, Christopher Reeve said &quot;Monsignor&quot; &quot;was a horrible picture and deserved to be lambasted&quot; and a &quot;very bad movie.&quot; He complained that the film &quot;makes serious allegations about a religious figure and fails to prove it.&quot; Reeve lamented that &quot;we had the material and it was misused,&quot; blaming the result on &quot;corporate decision-making.&quot;

===Controversy===
On November 29, 1982, the film was banned from showing in the Republic of Ireland; the Irish Film Censor Board cited its conflation of religion and adultery, as it features an affair between a priest and a postulant nun. The decision was overturned by the Film Appeals Board on December 17; this caused controversy among members of Fianna Fáil – chairman Ned Brennan believed the majority of the Irish public did not want it to be released and said &quot;standards must be maintained&quot;, wanting it banned on &quot;moral grounds&quot;.

<doc id="1059727" wikidata="Q375273" url="?curid=1059727" title="Kula ring">
<text>Kula, also known as the Kula exchange or Kula ring, is a ceremonial exchange system conducted in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea. The Kula ring was made famous by Bronisław Malinowski, considered the father of modern anthropology. He used this test case to argue for the universality of rational decision-making and for the cultural nature of the object of their effort. Malinowski&#x27;s seminal work on the topic, &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot; (1922), directly confronted the question, &quot;Why would men risk life and limb to travel across huge expanses of dangerous ocean to give away what appear to be worthless trinkets?&quot; Malinowski carefully traced the network of exchanges of bracelets and necklaces across the Trobriand Islands, and established that they were part of a system of exchange (the Kula ring), and that this exchange system was clearly linked to political authority.

Malinowski&#x27;s study became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of &quot;The Gift&quot; (&quot;Essai sur le don&quot;, 1925). Since then, the Kula ring has been central to the continuing anthropological debate on the nature of gift-giving, and the existence of gift economies.
==Basic description==
The Kula ring spans 18 island communities of the Massim archipelago, including the Trobriand Islands, and involves thousands of individuals. Participants travel at times hundreds of miles by canoe in order to exchange Kula valuables, which consist of red shell-disc necklaces (&quot;veigun&quot; or &quot;soulava&quot;) that are traded to the north (circling the ring in clockwise direction) and white shell armbands (&quot;mwali&quot;) that are traded in the southern direction (circling counterclockwise). If the opening gift was an armband, then the closing gift must be a necklace and vice versa. The exchange of Kula valuables is also accompanied by the trade in other items known as &quot;gimwali&quot; (barter). The terms of participation vary from region to region. Whereas on the Trobriand Islands the exchange is monopolised by the chiefs, in Dobu there are between 100 and 150 people involved in Kula trade, between one and two in each matrilineage.

==Items for trade==

All Kula valuables are non-use items traded purely for purposes of enhancing one&#x27;s social status and prestige. Carefully prescribed customs and traditions surround the ceremonies that accompany the exchanges which establish strong, ideally lifelong relationships between the exchange parties (&quot;karayta&#x27;u&quot;, &quot;partners&quot;). The act of giving, as Mauss wrote, is a display of the greatness of the giver, accompanied by shows of exaggerated modesty in which the value of what is given is actively played down. (Marcel Mauss (1979), Sociología y Antropología, Ed. Tecnos, Madrid, page. 181) Such a partnership involves strong mutual obligations such as hospitality, protection and assistance. According to the Muyuw, a good Kula relationship should be &quot;like a marriage&quot;. Similarly, the saying around Papua is: &quot;once in the Kula, always in the Kula.&quot;

Kula valuables never remain for long in the hands of the recipients; rather, they must be passed on to other partners within a certain amount of time, thus constantly circling around the ring. However, even temporary possession brings prestige and status. Important chiefs can have hundreds of partners while less significant participants may only have fewer than a dozen. Even though the vast majority of items that Kula participants have at any given time are not theirs and will be passed on, Damon (1980:281) notes that e.g. amongst the Muyuw all Kula objects are someone&#x27;s &quot;kitoum&quot;, meaning they are owned by that person (or by a group). The person owning a valuable as &quot;kitoum&quot; has full rights of ownership over it: he can keep it, sell it or even destroy it. The Kula valuable or an equivalent item must be returned to the person who owns it as &quot;kitoum&quot;. For example, the most important Muyuw men own between three and seven Kula valuables as &quot;kitoum&quot;, while others do not own any. The fact that, at least in theory, all such valuables are someone&#x27;s &quot;kitoum&quot; adds a sense of responsibility to the way they are handled, reminding the recipient that he is only a steward of somebody else&#x27;s possession. (The ownership of a particular valuable is, however, often not known.) Kula valuables can be exchanged as &quot;kitoum&quot; in a direct exchange between two partners, thus fully transferring the rights of ownership.

==Trading and the social hierarchy==

The right of participation in Kula exchange is not automatic; one has to &quot;buy&quot; one&#x27;s way into it through participating in various lower spheres of exchange. The giver-receiver relationship is always asymmetrical: givers are higher in status. Also, Kula valuables are ranked according to value and age, as are the relationships that are created through their exchange. Participants will often strive to obtain particularly valuable and renowned Kula objects whose owner&#x27;s fame will spread quickly through the archipelago. Such a competition unfolds through different persons offering &quot;pokala&quot; (offerings) and &quot;kaributu&quot; (solicitory gifts) to the owner, thus seeking to induce him to engage in a gift exchange relationship involving the desired object. Kula exchange therefore involves a complex system of gifts and countergifts whose rules are laid down by custom. The system is based on trust as obligations are not legally enforceable. However, strong social obligations and the cultural value system, in which liberality is exalted as highest virtue while meanness is condemned as shameful, create powerful pressures to &quot;play by the rules&quot;. Those who are perceived as holding on to valuables and as being slow to give them away soon get a bad reputation (cf.).

The Kula trade was organized differently in the more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their Kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.

The Kula exchange system can be viewed as reinforcing status and authority distinctions since the hereditary chiefs own the most important shell valuables and assume the responsibility for organizing and directing the ocean voyages. Damon (1980) notes that large amounts of Kula valuables are handled by a relatively small number of people, e.g. amongst the Muyuw, three men account for over 50 percent of Kula valuables. The ten most influential men control about 90 percent of all and almost 100 percent of the most precious Kula objects. The movement of these valuables and the related relationships determine most of the Muyuw&#x27;s political alliances. Fortune notes that Kula relationships are fragile, beset with various kinds of manipulation and deceit. But the recent research results of Susanne Kuehling do not support Fortune&#x27;s emphasis on cheating and even killing in relation to king. The Muyuw for example state that the only way to get ahead in Kula is to lie, commenting that deceit frequently causes Kula relationships to fall apart. Similarly, Malinowski wrote of &quot;many squabbles, deep resentments and even feuds over real or imaginary grievances in the Kula exchange.&quot;

==Gift versus commodity exchange==

The Kula ring is a classic example of Marcel Mauss&#x27; distinction between gift and commodity exchange. Melanesians carefully distinguish gift exchange (Kula) and market exchange in the form of barter (&quot;gimwali&quot;). Both reflect different underlying value systems and cultural customs. The Kula, Mauss wrote, is not supposed to be conducted like &quot;gimwali&quot;. The former involves a solemn exchange ceremony, a &quot;display of greatness&quot; where the concepts of honour and nobility are central; the latter, in contrast, often done as part of Kula exchange journeys, involves hard bargaining and serves purely economic purposes.

Kula valuables are inalienable in the sense that they (or an equivalent object) have to be returned to the original owner. Those who receive them can pass them on as gifts, but they cannot be sold as commodities (except by the one who owns them as &quot;kitoum&quot;).

Malinowski, however, highlighted the unusual characteristics of these &quot;gifts&quot;. Malinowski placed the emphasis on the exchange of goods between &quot;individuals&quot;, and their &quot;non-altruistic&quot; motives for giving the gift: they expected a return of equal or greater value. In other words, reciprocity is an implicit part of gifting; there is no such thing as the &quot;free gift&quot; given without expectation. Mauss, in contrast, emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a &quot;total prestation&quot; (see Law of obligations) and not a gift in the Western sense of the word. They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, embodied the reputation, history, and sense of identity of a &quot;corporate kin group&quot;, such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked &quot;why anyone would give them away?&quot; His answer was an enigmatic concept, &quot;the spirit of the gift&quot;. A good part of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation of that phrase. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts. Jonathan Parry has demonstrated that Mauss was arguing instead that the concept of a &quot;pure gift&quot; given altruistically only emerges in societies with a well-developed market ideology, such as the West and India.

Mauss&#x27; concept of &quot;total prestations&quot; was further developed by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski&#x27;s fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her critique was twofold: first, Trobriand Island society is matrilineal, and women hold a great deal of economic and political power. Their exchanges were ignored by Malinowski. Secondly, she developed Mauss&#x27;s argument about reciprocity and the &quot;spirit of the gift&quot; in terms of &quot;inalienable possessions: the paradox of keeping while giving.&quot; Weiner contrasts &quot;moveable goods&quot; which can be exchanged with &quot;immoveable goods&quot; that serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts with women&#x27;s landed property). She argues that the specific goods given, like Crown Jewels, are so identified with particular groups that, even when given, they are not truly alienated.

Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist Maurice Godelier pushed the analysis further in &quot;The Enigma of the Gift&quot; (1999). Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the Kula ring in the Trobriands, the potlatch of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, and the Toraja of South Sulawesi, Indonesia) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with Claude Lévi-Strauss&#x27; model of &quot;House Societies&quot; (where &quot;House&quot; refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.

<text>Deathtrap is a 1982 American black comedy suspense film based on the 1978 play of the same name by Ira Levin. It was directed by Sidney Lumet from a screenplay by Levin and Jay Presson Allen, and stars Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve and Dyan Cannon. Critics gave the film mostly favorable reviews while noting its plot similarities to Caine&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Sleuth&quot;.

The film narrates the tale of a famous playwright, who has not had any hits in recent years. After his student entrusts him with the manuscript of a promising play, the writer tells his wife that if the student has not told anyone else about his play, he could kill the student and claim the manuscript as his own.

==Plot==
Famed playwright Sidney Bruhl debuts the latest in a series of Broadway flops and returns to his East Hampton, Long Island, home hungover and morose. Although his wife Myra assures him their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is starving for a hit. He reveals he has received a manuscript of a play by a student who recently attended one of his writing workshops, asking for his input. Sidney considers the work near-perfection, and tells Myra that the best idea he has had lately is to murder its author and produce the play as his own. Myra realizes that he is not joking.

Sidney invites young Clifford Anderson to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from his own plays, to discuss the script, &quot;Deathtrap&quot;. Clifford, handsome, unattached, and full of both naivete and enthusiasm, arrives by train. Over the course of the evening Myra tries desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail. Sidney entices Clifford to try on a pair of Harry Houdini’s trick escape handcuffs. When Clifford finds that they do not work both he and Myra become nervous. Eventually Sidney gives Clifford their key, but before he can remove them Sidney attacks and strangles him with a chain.

Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing during an unexpected visit from neighbor Helga Ten Dorp, a Dutch psychic and minor European celebrity renting an adjacent property. Helga senses pain and death in the house. Before she leaves, she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him.

As Myra prepares for bed, she begins to come to terms with what Sidney has done. She heads downstairs for a drink, but a sound spooks her and she flees back upstairs, suspecting an intruder. Sidney takes her back downstairs to prove that all is well and they return to the bedroom. The calm is broken when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out and she collapses and dies.

Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and joins Clifford. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra&#x27;s body, then passionately kiss. The previous few hours are revealed to have been an elaborate ruse to kill Myra without laying a hand on her.

Clifford moves in with Sidney and the two work together at a partner&#x27;s desk. Sidney suffers from writer&#x27;s block, but Clifford busily types page after page of a new play that he keeps under lock and key. While Clifford is out grocery shopping, Sidney tries to break into the drawer, but fails. He waits for Clifford to retrieve his play, then switches Clifford&#x27;s manuscript with a fake.

Sidney is horrified to read that Clifford is using the true story of Myra&#x27;s murder as the basis of a new play called &quot;Deathtrap&quot;. He angrily confronts Clifford, who boasts about the play&#x27;s potential and insists he will write it with or without Sidney&#x27;s approval. Clifford offers to share the credit with Sidney, who comes to believe that Clifford is a sociopath. Sidney plays along with collaborating on &quot;Deathtrap&quot; while he plots a solution. A few days later, Helga stops by, ostensibly for candles in anticipation of a predicted thunderstorm. Clifford tells her that he works for Sidney as his secretary. When Sidney comes home, Helga warns Sidney that Clifford is the man in boots. Sidney tells Helga not to worry and that he is about to fire Clifford.

Sidney asks Clifford to arm himself with an axe to demonstrate a bit of stage business, then produces a gun. He intends to shoot Clifford, claim it was in self-defense and dispose of the &quot;Deathtrap&quot; manuscript. But Sidney finds his gun to be empty. Clifford had anticipated some such scheme from him and has loaded the bullets into a different gun. Clifford now intends to use Sidney&#x27;s attempted betrayal-and-axe scheme in the play. He secures Sidney to a chair with manacles and tells him he is going to pack up and leave. He warns Sidney to not try to stop the production of the play.

However, Clifford is unaware the manacles are trick shackles, another Houdini prop. Sidney easily releases himself, grabs a crossbow, goes outside, and climbs up to the bedroom window. He enters, and descending the stairs shoots Clifford in the back with a single bolt. Before Sidney can dispose of the body, the storm hits with full force and the house suffers a blackout. A flash of lightning illuminates the living room and a fleeting figure scurries through. It is Helga, thinking Sidney is in danger and coming to help.

She realizes that Sidney actually poses the threat and grabs a gun while Sidney finds a knife. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues. Clifford stumbles to his feet, grabs the axe and swings it at Sidney. In that moment, the scene transitions to a stage version of itself, with actors before a full house. The on-stage struggle culminates with &quot;Clifford&quot; stabbing &quot;Sidney&quot; and both dying, leaving &quot;Helga&quot; victorious. The opening night audience erupts in thunderous applause, and at the back of the theater stands an exultant Helga Ten Dorp, now the author of a hit Broadway play called &quot;Deathtrap&quot;.

== Cast ==
* Michael Caine as Sidney Bruhl
* Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson
* Dyan Cannon as Myra Bruhl
* Irene Worth as Helga Ten Dorp
* Henry Jones as Porter Milgrim
* Joe Silver as Seymour Starger

Real-life film and theatre critics Stewart Klein, Jeffrey Lyons and Joel Siegel have cameo appearances as themselves.

== Reception ==
Critic Roger Ebert gave it three stars, calling it &quot;a comic study of ancient and honorable human defects, including greed, envy, lust, pride, avarice, sloth, and falsehood.&quot; Ebert, along with Janet Maslin, and Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted the similarities to Caine&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Sleuth&quot;, and similarities have subsequently been noted by film historians.

Cannon was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her performance.

The kissing scene between Sidney and Clifford is not in the original play (although they are revealed to be lovers). In his book &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, gay film historian Vito Russo reports that Reeve said that the kiss was booed by preview audiences in Denver, Colorado, and estimated that a &quot;Time&quot; magazine report of the kiss spoiled a key plot element and cost the film $10 million in ticket sales. (The film earned more than $19 million at the box office.) In his book &quot;Murder Most Queer&quot; (2014), Jordan Schildcrout describes attending a screening at which an audience member screamed, &quot;No, Superman, don&#x27;t do it!&quot; at the moment of the Caine–Reeve kiss.

&quot;Deathtrap&quot; has a positive rating of 74% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.

==Home video release==
&quot;Deathtrap&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD on July 27, 1999. It was re-released on November 8, 2003, as half of a two-pack with the Henry Winkler/Michael Keaton buddy film &quot;Night Shift&quot;. Warner Home Video released &quot;Deathtrap&quot; on Blu-ray Disc on November 20, 2012, as part of the Warner Archive Collection.

<text>Arch of the Sergii (Croatian: &quot;Slavoluk Sergijevaca&quot;; Italian: &quot;Arco dei Sergi&quot;) is an Ancient Roman triumphal arch located in Pula, Croatia. The arch commemorates three members of the Sergii family, specifically Lucius Sergius Lepidus, a tribune serving in the twenty-ninth legion that participated in the Battle of Actium and disbanded in 27 BC. This suggests an approximate date of construction: 29–27 BC. The arch stood behind the original naval gate of the early Roman colony. The Sergii were a powerful family of officials in the colony and retained their power for centuries.

==History==
The honorary triumphal arch, originally a city gate, was erected as a symbol of the victory at Actium. As the main inscription proclaims, it was paid for by the wife of Lepidus, Salvia Postuma Sergia. Both of their names are carved in the stone along with Lucius Sergius and Gaius Sergius, the honoree&#x27;s father and uncle respectively. In its original form, statues of the two elders flanked Lepidus on both sides on the top of the arch. On either side of the inscription, a frieze depicts cupids, garlands and bucrania. 

This small arch with pairs of crenelated Corinthian columns and winged victories in the spandrels, was built on the facade of a gate (&quot;Porta Aurea&quot;) in the walls, so the part, visible from the town-side, was decorated. The decoration is late hellenistic, with major Asia Minor influences. The low relief on the frieze represents a scene with a war chariot drawn by horses.

This arch has attracted the attention of many artists, including Michelangelo and Piranesi.

<text>A fire brick, firebrick, fireclay brick, or [[refractory]] brick is a block of ceramic material used in lining furnaces, kilns, fireboxes, and fireplaces. A refractory brick is built primarily to withstand high temperature, but will also usually have a low thermal conductivity for greater energy efficiency. Usually dense fire bricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical, chemical, or thermal stresses, such as the inside of a wood-fired kiln or a furnace, which is subject to abrasion from wood, fluxing from ash or slag, and high temperatures. In other, less harsh situations, such as in an electric or natural gas fired kiln, more porous bricks, commonly known as &quot;kiln bricks&quot;, are a better choice. They are weaker, but they are much lighter and easier to form and insulate far better than dense bricks. In any case, firebricks should not spall, and their strength should hold up well during rapid temperature changes.

==Manufacture==
In the making of firebrick, fire clay is fired in the kiln until it is partly vitrified. For special purposes, the brick may also be glazed. There are two standard sizes of fire brick: and . Also available are firebrick &quot;splits&quot; which are half the thickness and are often used to line wood stoves and fireplace inserts. The dimensions of a split are usually . Fire brick was first invented in 1822 by William Weston Young in the Neath Valley of Wales.

==High temperature applications==
The silica fire bricks that line steel-making furnaces are used at temperatures up to , which would melt many other types of ceramic, and in fact part of the silica firebrick liquefies. High-temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI), a material with the same composition, was used in the insulating tiles of the Space Shuttle.

Non-ferrous metallurgical processes use &quot;basic&quot; refractory bricks because the slags used in these processes readily dissolve the &quot;acidic&quot; silica bricks. The most common basic refractory bricks used in smelting non-ferrous metal concentrates are &quot;chrome-magnesite&quot; or &quot;magnesite-chrome&quot; bricks (depending on the relative ratios of magnesite and chromite ores used in their manufacture).

==Lower temperature applications==
A range of other materials find use as firebricks for lower temperature applications. Magnesium oxide is often used as a lining for furnaces. Silica bricks are the most common type of bricks used for the inner lining of furnaces and incinerators. As the inner lining is usually of sacrificial nature, fire bricks of higher alumina content may be employed to lengthen the duration between re-linings. Very often cracks can be seen in this sacrificial inner lining shortly after being put into operation. They revealed more expansion joints should have been put in the first place, but these now become expansion joints themselves and are of no concern as long as structural integrity is not affected. Silicon carbide, with high abrasive strength, is a popular material for hearths of incinerators and cremators. Common red clay brick may be used for chimneys and wood-fired ovens.

==Potential use to store energy==

Firebricks, with their ability to withstand high temperatures and store heat, offer a promising solution for storing energy. These refractory bricks can be used to store industrial process heat, leveraging excess renewable electricity to create a low-cost, continuous heat source for industry. Due to their construction from common materials, firebrick storage systems are much more cost-effective than battery systems for thermal energy storage. Research across 149 countries indicates that using firebricks for heat storage can significantly reduce the need for electricity generation, battery storage, hydrogen production, and low-temperature heat storage. This approach could lower overall energy costs by about 1.8%, making firebricks a valuable tool in reducing the costs of transitioning to 100% clean, renewable energy.

<text>The AFC Champions League Elite (abbreviated as the ACL Elite) is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Asian Football Confederation, and contested by Asia&#x27;s top-division football clubs. It is the most prestigious club competition in Asian football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

Introduced in 1967 as the &quot;Asian Champion Club Tournament&quot;, the competition rebranded as AFC Champions League in 2002 following the merger of the Asian Club Championship, the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the Asian Super Cup. It was rebranded again in 2024 to its current name.

A total of 24 clubs compete in the league stage of the competition, divided into East and West regions (12 teams each). The winner of the AFC Champions League Elite qualifies for the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup, and also for the next edition of the AFC Champions League Elite league stage if they have not already qualified through their domestic performance.

The most successful club in the competition is Al-Hilal with a total of four titles. Al Ain are the current champions, having beaten Yokohama F. Marinos in the 2024 final.

==History==

===1967–1972: Asian Champion Club Tournament===
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) first discussed launching a tournament for the champions of AFC nations in a meeting held on 21 April 1963, with its Secretary Lee Wai Tong announcing the AFC&#x27;s intention to hold a competition similar to the European Cup. The competition started in 1967 as the Asian Champion Club Tournament and had a variety of different formats in its first few years, with the inaugural tournament staged as a straight knock-out format, and the following three editions consisting of a group stage.

While Israeli clubs dominated the first four editions of the competition, this was partly due to the refusal of Arab clubs to play them:
* In 1970, Lebanese club Homenetmen refused to play Hapoel Tel Aviv in the semi-final, which was scratched with Hapoel advancing to the final.
* In 1971, Aliyat Al-Shorta of Iraq refused to play Maccabi Tel Aviv on three occasions: in the preliminary round (which was redrawn), in the group stage, and then in the final, which was scratched with Maccabi being awarded the championship. During the award ceremony for Maccabi, Aliyat Al-Shorta players waved the Palestinian flag around the field, with a match being arranged by the AFC and the Thai FA between Maccabi and a Combined Bangkok team in lieu of the final. The Iraqi media considered Aliyat Al-Shorta as the tournament&#x27;s winners, with the team holding an open top bus parade in Baghdad.

After the 1972 edition had to be cancelled by the AFC for various reasons, including two Arab clubs being excluded for refusing to commit to playing against Israeli club Maccabi Netanya, the AFC suspended the competition for 14 years, while Israel would be expelled from the AFC in 1974.

===1985–2002: Return as the Asian Club Championship===
Asia&#x27;s premier club tournament made its return in 1985 as the Asian Club Championship.

In 1990, the Asian Football Confederation introduced the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, a tournament for the cup winners of each AFC nation, while the 1995 season saw the introduction of the Asian Super Cup, with the winners of the Asian Club Championship and Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup playing against each other.

===2002–2024: AFC Champions League===

The 2002–03 season saw the Asian Club Championship, Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and Asian Super Cup combine to become the AFC Champions League. League champions and cup winners would qualify for the qualifying playoffs with the best eight clubs from East Asia and the eight best clubs from West Asia progressing to the group stage. The first winners under the AFC Champions League name were Al-Ain, defeating BEC Tero Sasana 2–1 on aggregate. In 2004, 29 clubs from fourteen countries participated and the tournament schedule was changed to March–November.

In the group stage, the 28 clubs were divided into seven groups of four on a regional basis, separating East Asian and West Asian clubs to reduce travel costs, and the groups were played on a home and away basis. The seven group winners along with the defending champions qualified to the quarter-finals. The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals were played as a two-legged format, with away goals, extra time, and penalties used as tie-breakers.

====Expansion====
The 2005 season saw Syrian clubs join the competition, thus increasing the number of participating countries to 15, and two years later, following their transfer into the AFC in 2006, Australian clubs were also included in the tournament. However, many blamed the low prize money at that time and expensive travel cost as some of the reasons. The Champions League was expanded to 32 clubs in 2009 with direct entry to the top ten Asian leagues. Each country received up to 4 slots, though no more than one-third of the number of teams in that country&#x27;s top division, rounded downwards, depending on the strength of their league, professional league structure, marketability, financial status, as well as other criteria set by the AFC Pro-League Committee. The assessment criteria and ranking for participating associations are revised by AFC every two years.

The old format saw the eight group winners and eight runners-up qualify to the round of 16, in which group winners played host to the runners-up in two-legged series, matched regionally, with away goals, extra time, and penalties used as tie-breakers. The regional restriction continues all the way until the final, although clubs from the same country couldn&#x27;t face each other in the quarterfinals unless that country has three or more representatives in the quarterfinals. Since 2013, the final has also been held as a two-legged series, on a home and away basis.

In 2021, the group stage was expanded from 32 to 40 teams, with both the West and East Regions having five groups of four teams. The slot allocation for the top six member associations in each region remained unchanged. The 10 group winners and top 3 runners-up per region are now seeded based on a combination table for the round of 16, with the games still matched regionally until the final.

On 25 February 2022, it was announced that the AFC Champions League would go back to an inter-year (autumn to spring) schedule starting with the 2023–24 season. In addition, the existing &quot;3+1&quot; rule for foreign players during matches (3 foreign players and 1 Asian foreigner) was expanded to &quot;5+1&quot; (5 foreign players and 1 Asian foreigner).

====Women&#x27;s rights in Iranian football====
By 2021, the various problems with the Iranian sides were attracting media attention; international Arabic and English-language media reported the violation of women&#x27;s rights in the stadiums of Iranian sides.

On top of that, Iranian women were banned from football stadiums for about 40 years, by the Iranian government. In 2019, Iranian women were first allowed to watch football at stadiums, but not during ACL games. Before that, FIFA had pressured Iran to let women into the stadiums; Iran relented, but capped the number of women to watch the 2018 final. In 2021, the AFC investigated the matter, in the hope of allowing unrestricted attendance whenever Iranian clubs are involved.

=== 2024–25 onwards: AFC Champions League Elite===
On 23 December 2022, the AFC announced that their club football structure would undergo an overhaul, with the top club competition shrinking from 40 teams in the main stage to 24 teams, divided into East and West regions (12 teams each), with each team in the East and West regions playing eight other teams from their region (four teams at home and four teams away). The top eight teams from each region would advance to the knockout stage, where only the round of 16 would be played over two legs, with all matches from the quarter-finals onward being played in a single-leg format at a centralised venue. On 14 August 2023, it was confirmed that the new format would come into effect from the 2024–25 season, with the name of the competition changing to AFC Champions League Elite. The AFC has also confirmed that AFC Champions League records and statistics would be carried forward to the ACL Elite. In December 2023, Saudi Arabia were awarded hosting duties for the final stage for the first two seasons.

==Format==
===Qualification===
As of the 2024–25 edition of the tournament, the AFC Champions League Elite uses a league stage format of 24 teams, which is preceded by qualifying matches for teams that do not receive direct entry to the competition proper. Teams are also split into East and West zones.

The number of teams that each association enters into the AFC Champions League Elite is determined annually through criteria as set by the AFC Competitions Committee. The criteria, which is a modified version of the UEFA coefficient, measures such thing as marketability and stadia to determine the specific number of berths that an association receives. The higher an association&#x27;s ranking as determined by the criteria, the more teams represent the association in the competition.

===Tournament===
The tournament proper begins with a league stage of 24 teams, which are split into two leagues (East and West), with each team playing against eight opponents from their league (four at home and four away).

The top eight teams from each league advance to the round of 16. In this phase, each club face another club from its region in a two-legged, home-and-away tie to decide which eight clubs progress to a centralised Finals tournament. If the aggregate score of the two games is tied after 180 minutes, the clubs play extra time. If still tied after extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out.

The quarter-finals, semi-finals and final matches all feature cross-regional pairings, and are played in a single-leg format at centralised venue.

===Allocation===
Teams from 24 AFC countries have reached the group stage of the AFC Champions League Elite. The allocation of teams by member countries is listed below; asterisks represent occasions where at least one team was eliminated in qualification prior to the group stage. 32 AFC countries have had teams participate in qualification, and countries that have never had teams reach the group stage are not shown.

<doc id="1059768" wikidata="Q5054109" url="?curid=1059768" title="Cattle feeding">
<text>There are different systems of feeding cattle in animal husbandry. For pastured animals, grass is usually the forage that composes the majority of their diet. In turn, this grass-fed approach is known for producing meat with distinct flavor profiles. Cattle reared in feedlots are fed hay supplemented with grain, soy and other ingredients to increase the energy density of the feed. The debate is whether cattle should be raised on fodder primarily composed of grass or a concentrate. The issue is complicated by the political interests and confusion between labels such as &quot;free range&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;, or &quot;natural&quot;. Cattle raised on a primarily foraged diet are termed &quot;grass-fed&quot; or &quot;pasture-raised&quot;; for example meat or milk may be called &quot;grass-fed beef&quot; or &quot;pasture-raised dairy&quot;. The term &quot;pasture-raised&quot; can lead to confusion with the term &quot;free range&quot;, which does not describe exactly what the animals eat.

==Types of feeding==
===Grazing===

Grazing by cattle is practiced in rangelands, pastures and grasslands. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, about 60% of the world&#x27;s grassland is occupied by grazing systems. &quot;Grazing systems supply about 9 percent of the world&#x27;s production of beef ... For an estimated 100 million people in arid areas, and probably a similar number in other zones, grazing livestock is the only possible source of livelihood.&quot;

===Integrated livestock-crop farming===

In this system, cattle are primarily fed on pastures, crop residues and fallows. Mixed farming systems are the largest category of livestock system in the world in terms of production.

===Feedlot and intensive finishing===
Feedlot and intensive finishing are intensive forms of animal production. Cattle are often &quot;finished&quot; here, spending the last months before their slaughter gaining weight. They are fed nutritionally dense feed, also known as &quot;concentrate&quot; or &quot;filler corn&quot;, in stalls, pens and feedlots at high stocking densities in enclosures. This achieves maximal rates of liveweight gain.

==Types of cattle feeds==
Many distinct types of feed may be used, depending on economics, cattle type, region, etc. Feed types may also be mixed together, such as with total mixed ration.

===Grass-fed===
Grass and other forage compose most or the majority of a grass-fed diet. There is debate whether cattle should be raised on diets primarily composed of pasture (grass) or on a concentrated diet of grain, soy, and other supplements. The issue is often complicated by the political interests and confusion between labels such as &quot;free range&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;, and &quot;natural&quot;.

Cattle reared on a primarily forage diet are termed grass-fed or pasture-raised; meat or milk may be called &quot;grass-fed beef&quot; or &quot;pasture-raised dairy&quot;. The term &quot;pasture-raised&quot; can lead to confusion with the term &quot;free range&quot; which describes where the animals reside, but not what they eat. Thus, cattle can be labelled free-range yet not necessarily be grass-fed, and vice versa, and organic beef can be either or none. Another term adopted by the industry is grass-finished (also, 100% grass-fed), for which cattle are said to spend 100% of their lives on grass pasture. The Agricultural Marketing Service of the United States Department of Agriculture previously had a regulated standard for certification as &quot;Grass Fed&quot; meat, but withdrew the standard in 2016. However, producers must still apply the USDA&#x27;s Food Safety and Inspection Service for the right to put &quot;grass fed&quot; on a label.

===Corn-fed===
Cattle called corn-fed, grain-fed or corn-finished are typically raised on maize, soy and other types of feed. Some corn-fed cattle are raised in concentrated animal feeding operations known as feed lots.

In the United States, dairy cattle are often supplemented with grain to increase the efficiency of production and reduce the area needed to support the energy requirements of the herd.

A high-energy diet increases milk output, measured in pounds or kilograms of milk per head per day.

===Barley-fed===
In Western Canada beef cattle are usually finished on a barley-based diet.

===Flax===

In some parts of the world flax (or linseed) is used to make linseed oil, and the substance is mixed with other solid cattle feed as a protein supplement. It can only be added at low percentages due to the high fat content, which is unhealthy for ruminants. One study found that feeding flax seeds may increase omega-3 content and improve marbling in the resultant beef, while another found no differences.

===Other===
There are many alternative feeds which are given to cattle, either as a primary or supplemental feed. These range from alfalfa and other forages, silages of diverse plants, crop residues such as pea regrowth, straw or seed hulls, residues from other production such as oilseed meal cake, molasses, whey, and crops such as beets or sorghum.

===Drought fodder for extensive rangeland agriculture===

Drought events put rangeland agriculture under pressure in semi-arid and arid geographic areas. Innovative emergency fodder production concepts have been reported, such as bush-based animal fodder production in Namibia. During extended dry spells, farmers have turned to use woody biomass fiber from encroacher bush as a primary source of cattle feed, adding locally available supplements for nutrients as well as to improve palatability.

==Medicinal and synthetic additives==
Cattle feed may also include various substances such as glycerol, veterinary drugs, growth hormones, feed additives or nutraceuticals to improve production efficiency.

===Antibiotics===

Antibiotics are routinely given to livestock, which account for 70% of the antibiotic use in the United States. This practice contributes to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is a naturally occurring phenomenon throughout the world due to the overuse and/or inappropriate use of antibiotics. The most common form of antibiotics are called ionophores. Ionophores were originally developed as coccidiostats for poultry, and prevent coccidiosis in cattle as well. Ionophores work by improving both feed efficiency and growth rate, and lower methane production as one result. These effectively work as growth promoters due to an increase in food and water uptake and increase the digestive effectiveness of the animal.

Antibiotics are used in the cattle industry for therapeutic purposes in the clinical treatment of infections and prophylactically for disease prevention by controlling the growth of potentially harmful bacteria. Because of their effectiveness in the treatment and prevention of diseases, there is an increased efficiency of the farm. This results in reduced costs for cattle producers, and for consumers. Antibiotics are also present in antibacterial cleaning products, and in disinfection products used in farm and veterinary practices.

A critical journalist has claimed that the lower population density in free-range animals need decreased antibiotics usage, and has conjectured that cattle would not get sick if they were not fed a corn-based diet. However, bovine respiratory disease, the most common reason for antibiotic therapy, has risk factors common in both forms of production (feedlot and pasture finished).

====Safety====
Due to concerns about antibiotics residues getting into the milk or meat of cattle, there are regulatory agencies and measures in place in order to ensure that foods produced do not contain antibiotics at a level which will cause harm to consumers in the United States and Canada.

===Growth stimulants===

The use of supplemental growth hormones is controversial. The benefits of using growth hormones includes improved feed efficiency, carcass quality and rate of muscle development. The cattle industry takes the position that the use of growth hormones allows plentiful meats to be sold for affordable prices. Using hormones in beef cattle costs $1.50 and adds between to the weight of a steer at slaughter, for a return of at least $25.

Bovine somatotropin, or bovine growth hormone, is a naturally produced protein in cattle. Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), or recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), is growth hormone produced using microbes with modified (recombinant) DNA. The manufactured product Posilac, which was approved in the United States in 1993, was Monsanto&#x27;s first genetically-modified venture in that country; however, its use has been controversial. As of 2002, testing could not yet distinguish between artificial hormones and those naturally produced by the animal itself, but as of 2011, it was remarked that the amino acids differ. Some studies report an increased presence in humans of rBGH and its IGF-1 product molecule.

====Safety====
There exists customer concern about growth hormone use being linked to a number of human health problems, such as precocious puberty or cancer. However, there is no concrete evidence to give credence to these concerns. In Canada, all veterinary drugs used in food production processes are required to pass tests and regulations set by the Veterinary Drugs Directorate (VDD) and are enforced by the Food and Drug Act of Health Canada. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) monitors all food products in Canada by sampling and testing by veterinarians and inspectors working on behalf of the provincial and federal governments. They monitor the food supply to condemn and destroy any product that is unacceptable. In the rare case where the CFIA have found a residue, it has been substantially below the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) acceptable for safe consumption, this is the maximum amount of a drug residue that may remain in a food product at the time of human consumption based on Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADI). The ADI level is determined from toxicology studies to be the highest amount of a substance that can be consumed daily throughout a lifespan without causing adverse effects. Beef hormone residues are MRLs that have been established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the United Nations. The World Health Organization stated that the hormone levels are indistinguishable between implanted and non-implanted animals.

There are three natural hormones (estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone), naturally present in cattle and humans, their synthetic alternatives (zeranol, melengestrol acetate, and trenbolone acetate) have been approved by the for use in Canadian beef production. Studies show that the contribution of hormones from beef consumption is minuscule compared to the quantities produced naturally in the human body. For comparison, an adult male will produce 136,000 ng of estrogen on a given day; whereas the estrogen levels present in a 6-ounce serving of beef from a treated animal is only approximately 3.8 ng. In other words, a human being will produce almost 36,000 times the amount of estrogen in one day that would be present in a piece of beef produced with the growth hormones. Thus, current scientific evidence is insufficient to support the hypothesis that any diseases are caused by ingested hormones due to hormonal substance use in animals. However, the differences between levels in treated and non-treated animals were deemed significant enough for the EU to ban imports of U.S. beef.

==Effects of feed on health==

Flax seeds suppress inflammatory effects from bovine respiratory disease (BRD) often affecting stressed cattle during transport and processing. BRD can lead to lung tissue damage and impair the performance of the cattle leading to a low final body mass at slaughter, or premature death.

==Effects of feed on product==
===Marbling and fats===
Most grass-fed beef is leaner than feedlot beef, lacking marbling, which lowers the fat content and caloric value of the meat. Meat from grass-fed cattle has higher levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and the omega-3 fatty acids, ALA, EPA, and DHA.

A study showed that tissue lipids of North American and African ruminants were similar to pasture-fed cattle, but dissimilar to grain-fed cattle. The lipid composition of wild ruminant tissues may serve as a model for dietary lipid recommendations in treating and preventing chronic disease.

===Dairy===
In 2021, food management system expert Sylvain Charlebois remarked on the industry&#x27;s use of palm oil, given as palmitic acid supplements, to augment the output of milk product: they &quot;are marketed as a way to increase milk output and boost fat content&quot; but a &quot;review by the Dairy Research and Extension Consortium of Alberta found that butter made from cows fed palm oil remains difficult to spread at room temperature.&quot; Consumers were dismayed because the physical characteristics of the dairy products had undergone a significant change, notably in increased hardness and increased melting point of the palm oil supplemented butter, although an item published in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; attempted to blame the consumer for the actions of the producer. Charlebois noted that this was not beneficial to the consumer, who was surprised and had not been notified of the social contract variation to his disadvantage.

===Taste===
The cow&#x27;s diet affects the flavor of the resultant meat and milk. A 2003 Colorado State University study found that 80% of consumers in the Denver-Colorado area preferred the taste of United States corn-fed beef to Australian grass-fed beef, and negligible difference in taste preference compared to Canadian barley-fed beef, though the cattle&#x27;s food was not the only difference in the beef tested, nor is Denver a representative sample of the world beef market, so the results are inconclusive.

Remarkably, in some circumstances, cattle are fed wine or beer. It is believed that this improves the taste of the beef. This technique has been used both in Japan and France.

===Nutrition===

Animal products for human consumption from animals raised on pasture have shown nutritional differences from those of animals raised on other feedstuffs.

===Health===
====&quot;E. coli&quot;====
&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, although considered to be part of the normal gut flora for many mammals (including humans), has many strains. Strain &quot;E. coli&quot; 0157:H7 can cause foodborne illness. A study found that grass-fed animals have as much as eighty percent less &quot;E. coli&quot; in their guts than their grain-fed counterparts, though this reduction can be achieved by switching an animal to grass only a few days prior to slaughter. Also, the amount of &quot;E. coli&quot; they do have is much less likely to survive our first-line defense against infection: stomach acid. This is because feeding grain to cattle makes their normally pH-neutral digestive tract abnormally acidic; over time, the pathogenic &quot;E. coli&quot; becomes acid resistant. If humans ingest this acid-resistant &quot;E. coli&quot; via grain-feed beef, a large number of them may survive past the stomach, causing an infection. A study by the USDA Meat and Animal Research Center in Lincoln Nebraska (2000) has confirmed the Cornell research.

====Bovine spongiform encephalopathy====
Meat and bone meal can be a risk factor for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), when healthy animals consume tainted tissues from infected animals. People concerned about Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), which is also a spongiform encephalopathy, may favor grass-fed cattle for this reason. In the United States, this risk is relatively low as feeding of protein sources from any ruminant to another ruminant has been banned since 1997. The problem becomes more complicated as other feedstuffs containing animal by-products are still allowed to be fed to other non-ruminants (chickens, cats, dogs, horses, pigs, etc.). Therefore, at a feed mill mixing feed for pigs, for instance, there is still the possibility of cross-contamination of feed going to cattle. Since only a tiny amount of the contaminating prion begins the cascading brain disease, any amount of mixed feed could cause many animals to become infected. This was the only traceable link among the cattle with BSE in Canada that led to the recent US embargo of Canadian beef. No cases of BSE have been reported so far in Australia. This is largely due to Australia&#x27;s strict quarantine and biosecurity rules that prohibit beef imports from countries known to be infected with BSE.

However, according to a report filed in &quot;The Australian&quot; on February 25, 2010, those rules were suddenly relaxed and the process to submit beef products from known BSE-infected countries was allowed (pending an application process). But less than a week later, Tony Burke, the Australian Minister For Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry overturned the decision and placed a &#x27;two year stop&#x27; on all fresh and chilled beef products destined for Australia from BSE known countries of origin, thereby relaxing fears held by Australians that contaminated US beef would find its way onto Australian supermarket shelves after a long absence.

Soybean meal is cheap and plentiful in the United States. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, US regulations only partially prohibit the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock such as pigs and poultry such as chickens. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals.

====&quot;Campylobacter&quot;====
&quot;Campylobacter&quot;, a bacterium that can cause another foodborne illness resulting in nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, headache and muscle pain, was found by Australian researchers to be carried by 58% of cattle raised in feedlots versus only 2% of pasture raised and finished cattle.

==Environmental concerns==

For environmental reasons, a study by Burney &quot;et al&quot;. advocates intensifying agriculture by making it more productive per unit of land, instead of raising cattle on pasture. Complete adoption of farming practices like grass-fed beef production systems would increase the amount of agricultural land needed and produce more greenhouse gas emissions. In some regions, livestock grazing has degraded natural environments such as riparian areas.

==Country-specific==

Beef production tends to be concentrated, with the top six producers—the US, the European Union, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, and Russia—accounting for about 60% of global production. Significant shifts among producers have occurred over time. Cattle production worldwide is differentiated by animal genetics and feeding methods, resulting in differing quality types. Cattle are basically residual claimants to crop or land resources. Those countries with excess or low-value land tend to grass-feed their cattle herds, while those countries with excess feed grains, such as the U.S. and Canada, finish cattle with a grain ration. Grain-fed cattle have more internal fat (i.e., marbling) which results in a more tender meat than forage-fed cattle of a similar age. In some Asian countries such as Japan, which is not a grain-surplus country, tastes and preferences have encouraged feeding grain to cattle, but at a high cost since the grain must be imported.

===Canada===
The majority of beef cattle in Ontario are finished on a corn (maize)-based diet, whereas Western Canadian beef is finished on a barley-based diet. This rule is not absolute, however, as producers in both regions will alter the mix of feed grains according to changes in feed prices. Research by the Ontario government claims that, while Alberta beef producers have organized a successful marketing campaign promoting Alberta&#x27;s barley-fed beef, corn-fed and barley-fed beef have a similar cost, quality, and taste.

Regulations on veterinary drug use in food animals and drug-residue testing programs ensure that the product in the grocery store is free of residue from antibiotics or synthetic hormones used in livestock.

The Animal Nutrition Association of Canada has developed a comprehensive Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) system for animal feed production called Feed Assure. This mandatory HACCP-based program includes a requirement for independent audits of feed mills including production processes and record keeping. The Canadian Cattlemen&#x27;s Association has also developed a HACCP based on-farm food safety program.

A complete HACCP system is mandatory for all federally inspected establishments. These systems include prerequisite programs, which are general procedures or good manufacturing practices that enhance food safety for all meat production processes. HACCP plans build on this foundation and are designed to control potential hazards for specific production processes.

====Alberta beef====
Alberta has become the center of the western Canadian beef industry and has 70% of the feedlot capacity and 70% of the beef processing capacity in Canada.

The Canadian province of Alberta has a very large land area (similar to Texas) and has more than of agricultural land, or about four times as much as Ontario. Because much of the land is better suited for cattle grazing than crop growing, it raises 40 percent of the cattle in Canada—about five million head. The other three western provinces are also well-endowed with land fit for grazing, so nearly 90 percent of Canadian beef cattle are raised in Alberta and the other western provinces. Alberta is outside the corn belt because the climate is generally too cool and too dry to grow corn for grain. The adjacent western provinces and northern US states are similar, so the use of corn as cattle feed has been limited at these northern latitudes. As a result, few cattle are raised on corn as a feed. The majority are raised on grass and finished on cold-tolerant grains such as barley. This has become a marketing feature of the beef.

The Alberta beef label found on some beef is not an indication of origin; this is a brand that only indicates that the beef was processed in Alberta. A percentage of the cattle have been raised in other western provinces or in the northwestern United States. These cattle are generally processed similarly, and are said to be distinct from the typically corn-fed beef produced in most of the US and Ontario. Under World Trade Organization rules, all of the beef produced in Alberta can be considered to be Alberta beef.

===United States===
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) there are 25–33 million feed cattle moving through custom and commercial cattle feed yards annually. The monthly USDA &quot;Cattle on Feed Report&quot; is available for public viewing.

====Labelling====
The USDA&#x27;s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) released a revised proposal for a grass-fed meat label for its process-verified labelling program in May 2006. This established a standard definition for the &quot;grass-fed&quot; claim which required continuous access to pasture and animals not being fed grain or grain-based products. The Union of Concerned Scientists, which in general supported the labelling proposal, claimed that the label, which contained the clause &quot;consumption of grain in the immature stage is acceptable&quot;, allowed for &quot;feed harvesting or stockpiling methods that might include significant amounts of grain&quot; because the term &quot;immature&quot; was not clearly defined. The label was revoked by the USDA on January 12, 2016, claiming it had no jurisdiction over what should be FDA regulations.

Until 2015, the US had mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) rules requiring that foreign beef be labelled as such under a complicated set of rules, but in 2015 the World Trade Organization ruled that the US was a violation of international trade law, so the US law was repealed.

<text>Maruti Suzuki India Limited is a publicly listed Indian subsidiary of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corporation. It is the largest automobile manufacturer in India, specialising in small cars. The company was established by the Government of India as Maruti Udyog Limited in February 1981 as a joint venture with Suzuki, the latter becoming the first Japanese automaker, as well as the first major foreign automaker, to invest in India.

Maruti opened its first production facility in Gurugram, Haryana, in 1982. Initially, Maruti was majority-owned by the Indian government, with Suzuki only taking a 26% stake during its establishment in 1982. The Indian government gradually reduced its stake, partially departed the business in 2003 by making it a public company and then sold all of its remaining shares to Suzuki Motor Corporation in 2007.

Maruti Suzuki has emerged as the largest Suzuki subsidiary in terms of production volume and sales. As of September 2022, the company had a leading market share of 42% in the Indian passenger car market.

== History ==

=== Pre-Suzuki affiliation ===
The Maruti name can be traced back to a previous company that was established by the third Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s son, Sanjay Gandhi. In the early 1970s, the Indian government initiated the search for a small car manufacturer. At that time, India had already been manufacturing cars for several years, and the idea of a more affordable &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; had been discussed since the 1950s.

Sanjay Gandhi, known for his passion for cars, apprenticed with Rolls-Royce in Crewe of UK for three years. Upon his return in 1968, he recognized the potential of small car production in the private sector. Both the government and the Planning Commission endorsed the concept. Sanjay Gandhi subsequently initiated his automotive project, establishing operations in a rented garage near Roshanara Bagh in Old Delhi.

The government issued a letter of intent in September 1970, which allowed Sanjay Gandhi to produce up to 50,000 cars in a year. In August 1971, Maruti Motors Limited was established with Sanjay Gandhi becoming its first managing director. He acquired 297 acres of land in Gurgaon at a cost of approximately Rs 12,000 per acre to establish his Maruti factory. Initially, plans were laid out to manufacture an indigenous car priced at around Rs 8,000. However, the cost of the vehicle escalated to approximately Rs 16,500 (ex-showroom) and about Rs 21,000 on the road in Haryana. Despite the increase in price, the Maruti car remained competitively priced, being Rs 5,000-10,000 cheaper than its counterparts.

The first prototype of the Maruti car was completed in 1972, with production anticipated to commence by April 1973, as promised by Sanjay Gandhi. He made the chassis by himself at his workshop, and a Triumph motorcycle engine was used to propel the car. Amid allegations of nepotism, the Maruti car underwent a feasibility test by the Vehicle Research &amp; Development Establishment in Ahmednagar. The prototype failed the test, being deemed unsuitable for road use. Nonetheless, in July 1974, Maruti was granted an industrial license to produce 50,000 cars. However, the actual production output at Sanjay Gandhi&#x27;s factory fell short of the initial target. Despite the projection to commence production at a rate of 12-20 units per month and escalate to 200 units per day, only 21 units were manufactured by 31 March 1976.

Sanjay Gandhi&#x27;s involvement in politics during the Emergency further complicated the project&#x27;s progress. Following Indira Gandhi&#x27;s defeat in the 1977 election and a court order for Maruti&#x27;s dissolution in 1978, the project faced uncertain prospects. With Indira&#x27;s return to office in 1980 and Sanjay&#x27;s death in a plane crash, the Government of India intervened and assumed control of Maruti through legislative measures.

=== Tie-up with Suzuki ===
Following Sanjay&#x27;s death, his mother Indira tasked Arun Nehru with evaluating the feasibility of resurrecting her son&#x27;s vision to develop India&#x27;s affordable car. Nehru acknowledged the project&#x27;s potential but emphasized the need for expertise from an experienced manufacturer. Subsequently, a team was assembled to explore potential collaborations with manufacturers globally. The Indian government started engaging in negotiations with Suzuki in April 1982. Following several months of preparations, Suzuki of Japan and Maruti Udyog Ltd. signed a license and joint venture agreement in October 1982. Initially, Suzuki acquired a modest 26 percent stake in the joint venture, owing to their constrained capital and perceived risks, despite the Indian government&#x27;s preference for Suzuki to take a 40 percent foreign equity share. Both parties reached a consensus, stipulating that Suzuki would increase its stake to 40 percent after five years. Both the venture partners also entered into an agreement to nominate their candidate for the post of managing director and every managing director would have a tenure of five years. Suzuki later increased its equity to 50% in 1992, and further to 56.21% as of 2013. 

Maruti was granted permission to import two Suzuki vehicles that were completely assembled in the first two years of India&#x27;s closed market, with an initial target of using just 33% domestic components. This greatly displeased the nearby manufacturers. There were some concerns that the Indian market would not support Maruti Suzuki&#x27;s relatively high production levels, and the government even considered changing the petrol tariff and decreasing the excise fee to increase sales.

Local production commenced in December 1983 with the introduction of the SS30/SS40 Suzuki Fronte/Alto-based Maruti 800. In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was released. Maruti targeted annual production of 20,000 cars in the first year, and 40,000 in the second year at the Gurgaon plant. However, the rapid success of Maruti exceeded expectations of Suzuki. Within the first year, the company received an 120,000 bookings, much to Suzuki&#x27;s surprise. Despite facing overwhelming demand, Maruti encountered challenges in meeting orders due to capacity limitations. The surge in demand necessitated a complete overhaul of its production strategy, by adjusting the ratio between the 800 and the van.

The Suzuki SJ410-based Gypsy, a 970 cc 4-wheel drive off-road vehicle, was introduced in 1985. The 100,000th car manufactured by the firm was the 796 cc hatchback Suzuki Alto (SS80), which succeeded the original 800 in 1986. In 1987, the company started exporting to western markets, when a lot of 500 cars were sent to Hungary. By 1988, the capacity of the Gurgaon plant was increased to 100,000 units per annum.

Until 1992–1993, Maruti faced constraints in increasing capacity due to the need for foreign exchange. Moreover, securing funding for expansion was challenging, especially during the Indian economic crisis of 1991. The Indian government stipulated that expansion could only proceed with foreign loans to cover costs. Eventually, Maruti secured aid from Axiom Bank in Japan, allowing them to finance the foreign exchange component of their expansion. This enabled Maruti to establish a new production line in the Gurgaon plant, addressing the persistent issue of shortages.

In 1989, the Maruti 1000 was introduced and the 970 cc, three-box was India&#x27;s first contemporary sedan. By 1991, 65 percent of the components, for all vehicles produced, were indigenized. After the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991, Suzuki increased its stake in Maruti to 50 percent, making the company a 50-50 joint venture with the government of India as the other stakeholder.

In 1993, the Zen, a 993 cc engine hatchback was launched, and in 1994 the 1,298 cc Esteem sedan was introduced. Maruti produced its 1 millionth vehicle since the commencement of production in 1994. Maruti&#x27;s second plant was opened with an annual capacity reaching 200,000 units. Maruti launched a 24-hour emergency on-road vehicle service. In 1998, the new Maruti 800 was released, being the first change in design since 1986. Zen D, a 1,527 cc diesel hatchback, Maruti&#x27;s first diesel vehicle, and a redesigned Omni were introduced. In 1999, the 1.6-litre Maruti Baleno three-box sedan and Wagon R were also launched.

In 2000, Maruti became the first car company in India to launch a call center for internal and customer services. The new Alto model was released. In 2001, Maruti True Value, selling and buying used cars was launched. In October of the same year, the Maruti Versa was launched. In 2002, Esteem Diesel was introduced. Two new subsidiaries were also started: Maruti Insurance Distributor Services and Maruti Insurance Brokers Limited. Suzuki Motor Corporation increased its stake in Maruti to 54.2 percent.

In 2003, the new Suzuki Grand Vitara XL-7 was introduced while the Zen and the Wagon R were upgraded and redesigned. The four millionth Maruti vehicle was built and they entered into a partnership with the State Bank of India. Maruti Udyog Ltd. was listed on BSE and NSE after a public issue, which was oversubscribed tenfold. In 2004, the Alto became India&#x27;s best-selling car overtaking the Maruti 800 after nearly two decades. The five-seater Versa 5-seater, a new variant, was created while the Esteem was re-launched. Maruti Udyog closed the financial year 2003–04 with an annual sale of 472,122 units, the highest ever since the company began operations, and the fiftieth lakh (5 millionth) car rolled out in April 2005. The 1.3-litre Suzuki Swift five-door hatchback was introduced in 2005.

In 2006, Suzuki and Maruti set up another joint venture called Maruti Suzuki Automobiles India to build two new manufacturing plants, one for vehicles and one for engines. Cleaner cars were also introduced, with several new models meeting the new Bharat Stage III emission standards. In February 2012, Maruti Suzuki sold its ten millionth vehicle in India. In July 2014 it had a market share of more than 45%. In May 2015, the company produced its fifteen millionth vehicle in India, a Swift Dzire.

On 25 April 2019, Maruti Suzuki announced that it would phase out production of diesel cars by 1 April 2020, when the Bharat Stage VI emission standards come into effect. The new standards would require a significant investment from the company to upgrade its existing diesel engines to comply with the more stringent emission standards. Chairman R.C. Bhargava stated, &quot;We have taken this decision so that in 2022 we are able to meet the corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) norms and a higher share of CNG vehicles will help us comply with the norms. I hope the union government&#x27;s policies will help grow the market for CNG vehicles.&quot; At that time, diesel cars accounted for about 23 percent of Maruti Suzuki&#x27;s annual sales.

The company planned to launch its first electric car in the second half of 2021, the Maruti Suzuki Wagon R Electric, before cancelling its plan.
The company now intends to produce e Vitara (unveiled in Milan and based on eVX concept shown in 2023) instead in 2025.

==Manufacturing facilities==
Maruti Suzuki has two manufacturing facilities in Haryana (Gurugram and Manesar), and one manufacturing complex in Gujarat wholly owned by parent company Suzuki which supplies its entire production to Maruti Suzuki. All manufacturing facilities have a combined production capacity of 2,250,000 vehicles annually (1.5 million from Maruti Suzuki&#x27;s two plants and 750,000 from Suzuki Motor Gujarat).

The Gurgaon|Gurugram manufacturing facility has three fully integrated manufacturing plants and is spread over . The Gurgaon facilities also manufacture 240,000 &quot;K-Series&quot; engines annually. The Gurugram facility manufactures the Alto 800, Wagon R, Ertiga, XL6, S-Cross, Vitara Brezza, Ignis, and Eeco. The Gurugram facility also assembles the Jimny starting from January 2021 solely for export markets. It was reported the Indian-assembled Jimny will be exported to African markets and countries in the Middle East.

The Manesar manufacturing plant was inaugurated in February 2007 and is spread over . Initially, it had a production capacity of 100,000 vehicles annually but this was increased to 300,000 vehicles annually in October 2008. The production capacity was further increased by 250,000 vehicles taking the total production capacity to 800,000 vehicles annually. The Manesar plant produces the Alto, Swift, Ciaz, Baleno and Celerio. On 25 June 2012, Haryana State Industries and Infrastructure Development Corporation demanded Maruti Suzuki pay an additional ₹235 crore for enhanced land acquisition for its Haryana plant expansion. The agency reminded Maruti that failure to pay the amount would lead to further proceedings and vacating the enhanced land acquisition.

In 2012, the company decided to merge Suzuki Powertrain India Limited (SPIL) with itself. SPIL was started as a JV by Suzuki Motor Corp. along with Maruti Suzuki. It has the facilities available for manufacturing diesel engines and transmissions. The demand for transmissions for all Maruti Suzuki cars is met by the production from SPIL.

In 2017, the new Suzuki Motor Gujarat facility was opened. This third facility is not owned by Maruti Suzuki, but instead wholly owned by Suzuki Motor Corporation. Despite that, the plant supplied vehicles to Maruti without any additional cost. Located in Hansalpur, Ahmedabad, the plant has a total annual capacity of 750,000 units.

In November 2021 Maruti Suzuki announce to set up of a big plant in IMT Kharkhoda in Sonipat district across 900 acres with an investment of ₹18,000 crores.

Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation gives 900 acres of land to Maruti Suzuki for setting up a new plant in Industrial Model Township at Kharkhoda, Haryana.

In August 2022 Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi virtually laid the foundation stone of Maruti Suzuki&#x27;s new manufacturing plant in Kharkhoda. It will be one of the largest automobile manufacturing plant in the world with the capacity of making a million cars per year.

The Maruti Suzuki&#x27;s Gurugram manufacturing facility will shift to new manufacturing facility in Kharkhoda, Haryana will have four manufacturing plants in which a million cars will be produced annually and the Kharkhoda, Haryana plant will be third largest car producing facility in world. Along with this, the carmaker will invest 35,000 crores into building second manufacturing plant close to their Gujarat plant in the state with a million cars capacity per annum. The operations will commence in 2028-29 taking the production capacity combined to 4.35 million units annually.

==Controversies==
===Industrial relations===
Since its founding in 1983, Maruti Udyog Limited has experienced problems with its labor force. The Indian labor it hired readily accepted Japanese work culture and the modern manufacturing process. In 1997, there was a change in ownership, and Maruti became predominantly government controlled. Shortly thereafter, conflict between the United Front Government and Suzuki started. In 2000, a major industrial relations issue began and employees of Maruti went on an indefinite strike, demanding among other things, major revisions to their wages, incentives and pensions.

Employees used slowdown in October 2000, to press a revision to their incentive-linked pay. In parallel, after elections and a new central government led by NDA alliance, India pursued a disinvestment policy. Along with many other government owned companies, the new administration proposed to sell part of its stake in Maruti Suzuki in a public offering. The worker&#x27;s union opposed this sell-off plan on the grounds that the company will lose a major business advantage of being subsidized by the Government, and the union has better protection while the company remains in control of the government.

The standoff between the union and the management continued through 2001. The management refused union demands citing increased competition and lower margins. The central government privatized Maruti in 2002 and Suzuki became the majority owner of Maruti Udyog Limited.

===Manesar violence===
On 18 July 2012, Maruti&#x27;s Manesar plant was hit by violence. According to Maruti management, the production workers attacked supervisors and started a fire that killed company&#x27;s General Manager of Human Resources Avineesh Dev and injured 100 other managers, including two Japanese expatriates. The workers also allegedly injured nine policemen. However Maruti Suzuki Workers Union (MSWU) President Sam Meher alleged that management ordered 300 hired security guards to attack the workforce during the violence. The incident is the worst-ever for Suzuki since the company began operations in India in 1983.

Since April 2012, the Manesar union had demanded a three-fold increase in basic salary, a monthly conveyance allowance of 10,000, a laundry allowance of 3,000, a gift with every new car launch, and a house for every worker who wants one, or cheaper home loans for those who want to build their own houses. According to the Maruti Suzuki Workers Union a supervisor had abused and made discriminatory comments to a low-caste worker, Jiya Lal. These claims were denied by the company and the police. Maruti said the unrest began, not over wage discussions, but after the workers&#x27; union demanded the reinstatement of Jiya Lal who had been suspended for allegedly beating a supervisor. The workers claim harsh working conditions and extensive hiring of low-paid contract workers which are paid about $126 a month, about half the minimum wage of permanent employees. On 27 June 2013, an international delegation from the International Commission for Labor Rights (ICLR) released a report alleging serious violations of the industrial right of workers by the Maruti Suzuki management. Company executives denied harsh conditions and claim they hired entry-level workers on contracts and made them permanent as they gained experience. Maruti employees currently earn allowances in addition to their base wage.

The police, in its First Information Report (FIR), claimed on 21 July that Manesar violence is the result of a planned violence by a section of workers and union leaders and arrested 91 people. Maruti Suzuki in its statement on the unrest, announced that all work at the Manesar plant has been suspended indefinitely. The shut down of Manesar plant is leading to a loss of about ₹75 crore per day. On 21 July 2012, citing safety concerns, the company announced a lockout under The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 pending results of an inquiry the company has requested of the Haryana government into the causes of the disorder. Under the provisions of The Industrial Disputes Act for wages, the report claimed, employees are expected to be paid for the duration of the lockout. On 26 July 2012, Maruti announced employees would not be paid for the period of lock-out in accordance with Indian labor laws. The company further announced that it will stop using contract workers by March 2013. The report claimed the salary difference between contract workers and permanent workers has been much smaller than initial media reports – the contract worker at Maruti received about 11,500 per month, while a permanent worker received about 12,500 a month at start, which increased in three years to 21,000-₹22,000 per month. In a separate report, a contractor who was providing contract employees to Maruti claimed the company gave its contract employees the best wage, allowances and benefits package in the region.

Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director and chief executive of Maruti Suzuki India, said this type of violence has never happened in Suzuki Motor Corp&#x27;s global operations in Hungary, Indonesia, Spain, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, China and the Philippines. Nakanishi apologized to affected workers on behalf of the company, and in press interview requested the central and Haryana state governments to help stop further violence by legislating decisive rules to restore corporate confidence amid emergence of this new &#x27;militant workforce&#x27; in Indian factories. He announced, &quot;we are going to de-recognize Maruti Suzuki Workers&#x27; Union and dismiss all workers named in connection with the incident. We will not compromise at all in such instances of barbaric, unprovoked violence.&quot; He also announced Maruti plans to continue manufacturing in Manesar, that Gujarat was an expansion opportunity and not an alternative to Manesar.

The company dismissed 500 workers accused of causing the violence and re-opened the plant on 21 August, saying it would produce 150 vehicles on the first day, less than 10% of its capacity. Analysts said that the shutdown was costing the company 1 billion rupees ($18 million) a day and costing the company market share. In July 2013, the workers went on hunger strike to protest the continuing jailing of their colleagues and launched an online campaign to support their demands.

A total of 148 workers were charged with the murder of Human Resources Manager Avineesh Dev. The court dismissed charges against 117 of the workers. On 17 March 2017, 31 workers were found guilty of variety of offences. 18 were convicted on charges of rioting, trespassing, causing hurt and other related offences under Indian Penal Code sections. The remaining 13 workers were sentenced to life in imprisonment after being found guilty of the murder of General Manager of Human Resources Avineesh Dev. Twelve of the thirteen sentenced were office-bearers of the Maruti Suzuki Workers Union at the time of the alleged offences. The prosecution had sought the death penalty for the thirteen.

Both prosecution and defense have announced they will appeal against the sentences. Defense counsel Vrinda Grover stated, &quot;We will file appeals against all convictions in the HC. The evidence, as it stands, cannot withstand legal scrutiny. There is no evidence to link these workers to the murder. The 13 who have been convicted, it’s important to remember that they were the leaders of the union. Therefore, it is clear that this is targeted framing of these persons. We hope for justice in the superior court&quot;.

The Maruti Suzuki Workers Union is continuing to organize industrial action and protests calling for the workers to be released and criticizing the judgement and sentences an unjust. An international appeal for the release of the workers has been made by the International Committee for the Fourth International (ICFI) and other organizations such as the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy and Secularism (PADS).

===Automotive safety===
Maruti Suzuki has been criticized for compromising safety in their products by automotive enthusiasts, journalists, and the Global NCAP, as they are made lighter in terms of kerb weight to achieving higher fuel economy. Starting January 2014, several of their made for India cars were crash tested at Global NCAP, most of which have given disappointing results. Cars like Alto, Swift, Celerio, S-Presso (with driver&#x27;s airbag), and Eeco which had no safety features like airbags were awarded 0 stars, while Wagon-R and Swift (2018 model year) which had dual front airbags were awarded 2 stars out of 5. Only the Vitara, Brezza (4 stars) and Ertiga (3 stars) have been awarded decent safety ratings. Though Maruti Suzuki claimed that they were following the safety standards mandated by the Government of India, it however only implied with the safety features included in their cars and not the strong body shell or build quality which suffers the impact of the crash. Maruti Suzuki has also come under fire for discrimination with customers in India, by making cars safe meant for exports to European and African markets.

The chairman, RC Bhargava stated that &quot;&quot;If carmakers incorporate such features in even entry-level cars, obviously the price would go up, which would lead consumers to opt for two-wheelers, which would be more unsafe&quot;, which attracted criticism. The company, in February 2020, decided not to send their cars to Global NCAP for testing, as they only believe in the Safety Standards set by the Government of India. Following the crash test results of S-Presso, Alejandro Furas, Secretary General of Global NCAP said, “It is very disappointing that Maruti Suzuki, the manufacturer with the largest share of the Indian market, offers such low safety performance for Indian consumers. Domestic manufacturers like Mahindra and Tata have demonstrated high levels of safety and protection for their customers, both achieving five star performance. Surely it’s time for Maruti Suzuki to demonstrate this commitment to safety for its customers?” Alongside, David Ward, President of the Towards Zero Foundation said, &quot;We have seen important progress on car safety in India, with new legislation introduced by the government and manufacturers like Mahindra and Tata accepting the Global NCAP five star challenge and producing models which go well beyond minimum regulatory requirements. There is no place for zero rated cars in the Indian market. It remains a great disappointment that an important manufacturer like Maruti Suzuki does not recognize this.&quot;&quot;

For FY 2022 and 2023, Global NCAP crash tested the Swift, S-Presso, Ignis, and Wagon-R, each of which received 1-star rating, while the Alto K10 received 2-star rating. While these cars came with basic safety features such as ABS and Dual Front Airbags, as mandated by the Government of India, the body structure was rated unstable with inability to withstand further loads. Maruti Suzuki has faced ire by auto enthusiasts and media for prioritizing sales over safety by pricing the unsafe cars much lower than competitors, eventually earning the name &quot;Tin Cans&quot; for the unsafe cars.

=== Anti-competitive dealer policies ===
In Aug 2021, Maruti Suzuki was fined ₹200 Crore (US$28.57 million) by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for implementing its Discount Control Policy that restrains dealers from offering customer discounts beyond those prescribed by the carmaker.

Maruti Suzuki tied up with ABN Amro Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Limited, Kotak Mahindra, Standard Chartered Bank, and Sundaram to start this venture including its strategic partners in car finance.

===Maruti Accessories===
Many of the auto component companies, other than Maruti Suzuki, started to offer compatible components and accessories. This caused a serious threat and loss of revenue to Maruti Suzuki. Maruti Suzuki started a new initiative under the brand name &quot;Maruti Genuine Accessories&quot; to offer accessories like alloy wheels, body cover, carpets, door visors, fog lamps, stereo systems, seat covers and other car care products. These products are sold through dealer outlets and authorized service stations throughout India.

===Maruti Suzuki Driving School===

As part of its corporate social responsibility Maruti Suzuki launched the Maruti Driving School in Delhi. Later the services were extended to other cities of India as well. These schools are modelled on international standards, where learners go through classroom and practical sessions. Many international practices like road behavior and attitudes are also taught in these schools. Before driving actual vehicles participants are trained on simulators.

At the launch ceremony for the school Jagdish Khattar stated &quot;We are very concerned about mounting deaths on Indian roads. These can be brought down if government, industry and the voluntary sector work together in an integrated manner. But we felt that Maruti should first do something in this regard and hence this initiative of Maruti Driving Schools.&quot;

<doc id="1059781" wikidata="Q926272" url="?curid=1059781" title="Epimer">
<text>In stereochemistry, an epimer is one of a pair of diastereomers. The two epimers have opposite configuration at only one stereogenic center out of at least two. All other stereogenic centers in the molecules are the same in each. Epimerization is the interconversion of one epimer to the other epimer.

Doxorubicin and epirubicin are two epimers that are used as drugs. 
== Examples ==
The stereoisomers β--glucopyranose and β--mannopyranose are epimers because they differ only in the stereochemistry at the C-2 position. The hydroxy group in β-D-glucopyranose is equatorial (in the &quot;plane&quot; of the ring), while in β-D-mannopyranose the C-2 hydroxy group is axial (up from the &quot;plane&quot; of the ring). These two molecules are epimers but, because they are not mirror images of each other, are not enantiomers. (Enantiomers have the same name, but differ in and classification.) They are also not sugar anomers, since it is not the anomeric carbon involved in the stereochemistry. Similarly, β--glucopyranose and β--galactopyranose are epimers that differ at the C-4 position, with the former being equatorial and the latter being axial.

In the case that the difference is the -OH groups on C-1, the anomeric carbon, such as in the case of α--glucopyranose and β--glucopyranose, the molecules are both epimers and anomers (as indicated by the α and β designation).

Other closely related compounds are &quot;epi&quot;-inositol and inositol and lipoxin and epilipoxin.
==Epimerization==
Epimerization is a chemical process where an epimer is converted to its diastereomeric counterpart. It can happen in condensed tannins depolymerization reactions. Epimerization can be spontaneous (generally a slow process), or catalysed by enzymes, e.g. the epimerization between the sugars &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine and &quot;N&quot;-acetylmannosamine, which is catalysed by renin-binding protein.

The penultimate step in Zhang &amp; Trudell&#x27;s classic epibatidine synthesis is an example of epimerization. Pharmaceutical examples include epimerization of the erythro isomers of methylphenidate to the pharmacologically preferred and lower-energy threo isomers, and undesired &quot;in vivo&quot; epimerization of tesofensine to brasofensine.

<doc id="1059791" wikidata="Q5157334" url="?curid=1059791" title="Computational photography">
<text>Computational photography refers to digital image capture and processing techniques that use digital computation instead of optical processes. Computational photography can improve the capabilities of a camera, or introduce features that were not possible at all with film-based photography, or reduce the cost or size of camera elements. Examples of computational photography include in-camera computation of digital panoramas, high-dynamic-range images, and light field cameras. Light field cameras use novel optical elements to capture three dimensional scene information which can then be used to produce 3D images, enhanced depth-of-field, and selective de-focusing (or &quot;post focus&quot;). Enhanced depth-of-field reduces the need for mechanical focusing systems. All of these features use computational imaging techniques.

The definition of computational photography has evolved to cover a number of
subject areas in computer graphics, computer vision, and applied
optics. These areas are given below, organized according to a taxonomy
proposed by Shree K. Nayar. Within each area is a list of techniques, and for
each technique one or two representative papers or books are cited.
Deliberately omitted from the
taxonomy are image processing (see also digital image processing)
techniques applied to traditionally captured
images in order to produce better images. Examples of such techniques are
image scaling, dynamic range compression (i.e. tone mapping),
color management, image completion (a.k.a. inpainting or hole filling),
image compression, digital watermarking, and artistic image effects.
Also omitted are techniques that produce range data,
volume data, 3D models, 4D light fields,
4D, 6D, or 8D BRDFs, or other high-dimensional image-based representations. Epsilon photography is a sub-field of computational photography.

==Effect on photography==

Photos taken using computational photography can allow amateurs to produce photographs rivalling the quality of professional photographers, but as of do not outperform the use of professional-level equipment.

==Computational illumination==

This is controlling photographic illumination in a structured fashion, then processing the captured images,
to create new images. The applications include image-based relighting, image enhancement, image deblurring, geometry/material recovery and so forth.

High-dynamic-range imaging uses differently exposed pictures of the same scene to extend dynamic range. Other examples include processing and merging differently illuminated images of the same subject matter (&quot;lightspace&quot;).

==Computational optics==

This is capture of optically coded images, followed by computational decoding to produce new images.
Coded aperture imaging was mainly applied in astronomy or X-ray imaging to boost the image quality. Instead of a single pin-hole, a pinhole pattern is applied in imaging, and deconvolution is performed to recover the image. In coded exposure imaging, the on/off state of the shutter is coded to modify the kernel of motion blur. In this way motion deblurring becomes a well-conditioned problem. Similarly, in a lens based coded aperture, the aperture can be modified by inserting a broadband mask. Thus, out of focus deblurring becomes a well-conditioned problem. The coded aperture can also improve the quality in light field acquisition using Hadamard transform optics.

Coded aperture patterns can also be designed using color filters, in order to apply different codes at different wavelengths. This allows to increase the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor, compared to binary masks.

==Computational imaging==

Computational imaging is a set of imaging techniques that combine data acquisition and data processing to create the image of an object through indirect means to yield enhanced resolution, additional information such as optical phase or 3D reconstruction. The information is often recorded without using a conventional optical microscope configuration or with limited datasets.

Computational imaging allows to go beyond physical limitations of optical systems, such as numerical aperture, or even obliterates the need for optical elements.

For parts of the optical spectrum where imaging elements such as objectives are difficult to manufacture or image sensors cannot be miniaturized, computational imaging provides useful alternatives, in fields such as X-ray and THz radiations.

=== Common techniques ===
Among common computational imaging techniques are lensless imaging, computational speckle imaging, ptychography and Fourier ptychography.

Computational imaging technique often draws on compressive sensing or phase retrieval techniques, where the angular spectrum of the object is being reconstructed. Other techniques are related to the field of computational imaging, such as digital holography, computer vision and inverse problems such as tomography.

==Computational processing==

This is processing of non-optically-coded images to produce new images.

==Computational sensors==

These are detectors that combine sensing and processing, typically in hardware, like the oversampled binary image sensor. 

==Early work in computer vision==

Although computational photography is a currently popular buzzword in computer graphics, many of its
techniques first appeared in the computer vision literature,
either under other names or within papers aimed at 3D shape analysis.

==Art history==
Computational photography, as an art form, has been practiced by capture of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter, and combining them together. This was the inspiration for the development of the wearable computer in the 1970s and early 1980s. Computational photography was inspired by the work of Charles Wyckoff, and thus computational photography datasets (e.g. differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that are taken in order to make a single composite image) are sometimes referred to as Wyckoff Sets, in his honor.

Early work in this area (joint estimation of image projection and exposure value) was undertaken by Mann and Candoccia.

Charles Wyckoff devoted much of his life to creating special kinds of 3-layer photographic films that captured different exposures of the same subject matter. A picture of a nuclear explosion, taken on Wyckoff&#x27;s film, appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; Magazine and showed the dynamic range from dark outer areas to inner core.

<text>Tyagraj Paramasiva Iyer Kailasam (29 July 1884 – 1946), was an Indian playwright and prominent writer in the Kannada literature. Literary criticism in Kannada literature is said to have started for the first time by Kailasam in his works.

His contribution to Kannada theatrical comedy earned him the title &quot;Prahasana Prapitamaha&quot; (the great-grandfather of humorous plays). He was later often revered &quot;the one and only Kailasam for Kannada&quot;.

==Life==

Kailasam was born in a Tamil Iyer brahmin family in Mysore, Kingdom of Mysore (now Karnataka). He belonged to the Mangudi Brahacharanam subsect. His father, T Paramasiva Iyer, was a revenue collector in the Government of Mysore who later became the Chief Justice of Mysore High Court. His father&#x27;s brother, Sir T. Sadasiva Iyer, was a Chief Justice of Travancore High Court. Sir C.V. Raman is his father&#x27;s cousin on the paternal side.

Kailasam received a good education. He was supported by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV to study geology at the Royal College of Science, London. His close friends and classmates included K. V. Iyer and V. Seetharamaiah. Kailasam repeated several courses to have an excuse to extend his stay in England. He spent seven years in school there to complete his fellowship, participating in theatre whenever possible.

Soon after his return, he joined the geology service in Mysore government. He became disillusioned with a government job and quit to write plays and live a bohemian life. His father&#x27;s failed ambitious plan that he would become the Director General of the Department of Geology led him to stop talking to him.

== Playwright ==
Kailasam&#x27;s life was dedicated to local theatre and his contributions revolutionised it. His humour left an impression on Kannadigas. He opposed the company theatre&#x27;s obsession with mythology and stories of royalty and shied away from loading his plays with music. Instead, he introduced simple, realistic sets. Kailasam chaired the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held at Madras in 1945. A chainsmoker, he spent almost ten years at an apartment in Chamarajapuram which he called &quot;Nook&quot;. Reputedly a notoriously filthy place, he loved it and wrote many dramas in there. He dictated his stories to his students at the Nook, usually starting after 10pm.

Kailasam was initially criticised for modern use of the Kannada language in his plays at a time when the language was used under strict linguistic syntax and semantics. But soon after, his works became very popular and are considered among the best in Kannada theatre, known for wit and satirical commentary on society.

<doc id="1059813" wikidata="Q268464" url="?curid=1059813" title="Amazo">
<text>Amazo is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky and first appeared in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #30 (June 1960) as an adversary of the Justice League of America. Since debuting during the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared in comic books and other DC Comics-related products, including animated television series, trading cards and video games. Traditionally, Amazo is an android created by the villain scientist [[Professor Ivo]] and gifted with technology that allows him to mimic the abilities and powers of superheroes he fights (usually the Justice League), as well as make copies of their weapons (though these copies are less powerful than the originals). His default powers are often those of Flash, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern (the Justice League founding members that he first fought). He is similar and often compared with the later created Marvel android villain Super-Adaptoid (introduced 1966).

In the &quot;New 52&quot; timeline of DC Comics, Amazo begins as the A-Maze Operating System and then becomes an android capable of duplicating superhuman powers. Later on, a sentient Amazo Virus infects research scientist Armen Ikarus and takes over his mind. With Ikarus as a host, the Amazo Virus infects other people, granting them super-powers and controlling their minds before they die within 24 hours.

Amazo has been substantially adapted into media outside comics. Robert Picardo, Peter MacNicol, Thomas Lennon, and Nolan North, among others, have voiced the character in animated television series and films. Amazo also appears in the live-action Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Elseworlds&quot;.

==Publication history==
Amazo first appeared in a one-off story in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #30 (June 1960) and returned as an opponent of the Justice League of America in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #27 (May 1964) and #112 (August 1974), plus a briefer appearance in #65 when another antagonist weaponized Amazo and other items from the JLA trophy room. Other significant issues included an encounter with a depowered Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #480-483 (February – May 1978), and in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #191 (June 1981) and #241-243 (August – October 1985). Amazo also battles a fully powered Superman in &quot;Superman Special&quot; #3 (1985).

A different Amazo model featured in &quot;Justice League Quarterly&quot; #12 (Fall 1993) and battled the hero Aztek in &quot;Aztek: The Ultimate Man&quot; #10 (May 1997) before being destroyed in &quot;Resurrection Man&quot; #2 (June 1997). An advanced version debuted in a one-off story in &quot;JLA&quot; #27 (March 1999), while another appeared in the limited series &quot;Hourman&quot;, specifically issues #1, #5-7, #17, and #19-21 (April 1999 – December 2000).

Amazo&#x27;s origin is revealed in &quot;Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 (December 1999). Another version is discovered to be part of a weapons shipment in &quot;Batman&quot; #636-637 (March – April 2005) and during the &quot;Villains United&quot; storyline in &quot;Firestorm&quot; vol. 2 #14-16 (August – October 2005), &quot;Villains United&quot; #5-6 (November – December 2005), and the &quot;Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special&quot; (June 2006).

Amazo&#x27;s consciousness returned in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #1-5 (October 2006 – March 2007), planted in the body of fellow android the Red Tornado. Ivo also created Amazo&#x27;s &quot;offspring&quot; in &quot;JLA Classified&quot; #37-41 (June – October 2007). A story continuing the first Red Tornado storyline featured in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 2 #21-23 (July – September 2008).

Writer Mike Conroy noted: &quot;Amazo was a persistent thorn in the JLA&#x27;s side... although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest... His very existence is a hazard to all of humanity&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Modern Age===
The android Amazo was created by Professor Anthony Ivo, a scientist with expertise in multiple fields who is obsessed with immortality. The original Justice League of America (Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and the Martian Manhunter) discover their powers are being drained and somehow then being used by a thief who is after animals known to have long lifespans. While attempting to discover the perpetrator, the League is confronted and defeated by Amazo, who has duplicated their powers using Ivo&#x27;s &quot;absorption cell&quot; technology. Amazo brings the team to Ivo, who reveals he has created a means of extending his lifespan courtesy of the data obtained from studying the creatures Amazo captured. The League then defeats Ivo and the android. Ivo&#x27;s immortality results in his body becoming monstrous in form, and the android is stored in the League trophy room.

The android is temporarily re-activated twice to assist the League in regaining lost abilities. When red sun radiation reaches Earth, Amazo reactivates and engages in an extensive battle with Superman involving time-travel, only to be defeated before it can murder Ivo and the League. Later, the Key, having been shrunken in size, re-activates Amazo in a failed bid to return to normal. The League defeats Amazo, after which Zatanna restores the Key to his former state.

After the Justice League of America disbands and reforms as a small team of mostly new heroes based in Detroit, Ivo reactivates Amazo to attack this less experienced, &quot;weaker&quot; League. The android defeats all the new members but is finally stopped by Justice League founding members the Martian Manhunter and Aquaman.

A different Amazo model is later activated and battles the superhero team the Conglomerate. This updated Amazo searches for Ivo and encounters the hero Aztek, who succeeds in reasoning with the android rather than overpowering it. This Amazo model also briefly battles the Resurrection Man before finally being destroyed. Before his destruction, the second model of Amazo is summoned into the future by the android hero Hourman, who wishes to meet his &quot;ancestor&quot;. This Amazo copies Hourman&#x27;s time-warping Worlogog, becoming &quot;Timazo&quot; in the process. Timazo wreaks havoc with his new ability to manipulate time, but is defeated and returned to the past so his history can run its course. Another, similar model of Amazo later has several more encounters with Hourman.

Another model of Amazo is activated that can wield multiple powers at once and is programmed to automatically upgrade its abilities to match those of all active Justice League members. Initially not understanding this upgrade, the Justice League calls in reserve members to help defeat Amazo, which only results in its power increasing. On the Atom&#x27;s advice, Superman (active team chairman at the time) announces the League is officially disbanded. Programmed only to mimic the powers of active members, this Amazo is suddenly depowered and easily deactivated. Years later, Batman and Nightwing discover a partially built Amazo android in a weapons shipment and destroy it.

Another Amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of Metropolis, but is destroyed by Black Adam.

It is eventually revealed that after perfecting Amazo&#x27;s absorption cells, Ivo combined this technology with human ova and DNA to create a &quot;son&quot; of Amazo who grows up as Frank Halloran, unaware of his heritage. Years later, Frank is a philosophy student dating a young woman named Sara when his powers are awakened prematurely. Rather than emulate his villainous &quot;father&quot;, Frank hopes to be a hero called &quot;Kid Amazo&quot;. Slowly becoming mentally unstable, Kid Amazo discovers Sara is Ivo&#x27;s daughter and was instructed to monitor Frank by posing as a girlfriend. Kid Amazo goes on a rampage. Batman deduces Kid Amazo has not only the powers of the Leaguers but also their contrasting personality traits. This is later used to cause greater internal instability, destroying Kid Amazo.

Later, Ivo downloads Amazo&#x27;s programming into the body of the Red Tornado, the android villain-turned-hero created by Professor T.O. Morrow, another enemy of the Justice League. The League battles an army of Red Tornado androids before discovering that the villain Solomon Grundy intends to transfer his mind into the original android Tornado&#x27;s body. Although this plan is defeated, the Amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the League until member Vixen destroys it. A new body is created to house Red Tornado&#x27;s consciousness but the Amazo programming inhabits it instead, battling Justice League before he&#x27;s defeated by being teleported into the gravity well of the red star Antares.

===The New 52===
As part of The New 52, the new origin story of the Justice League references the &quot;A-Maze Operating System&quot; and &quot;B-Maze Operating System&quot; designed by Anthony Ivo. The League later battles an android equipped with a corrupt version of this operating system.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, the New 52 Amazo appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains.

During the &quot;Amazo Virus&quot; storyline, a biotech pathogen is created based on the android&#x27;s absorption cells. The first person to be infected by this virus is former Lexcorp research scientist Armen Ikarus, whose mind becomes corrupted in the process and replaced by the virus&#x27;s will. Now possessing power and driven to infect others, Ikarus&#x27;s personality is replaced by the new Amazo. The Ikarus Amazo infects others, granting them super-powers based on desires and personality traits, but killing them within 24 hours. The Ikarus Amazo, able to enhance infected humans and control them through a &quot;hive-mind&quot; connection, is defeated by the Justice League. Young Reggie Meyer and his family are also affected. Influenced by technology from the original Amazo android, Reggie becomes the second Kid Amazo.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. In the storyline &quot;Outbreak&quot;, Amazo is one of the villains recruited by an A.I. named Genie, created by the daughter of computer technician James Palmer. His technology cells are later hacked and he briefly joins the Justice League&#x27;s side.

Amazo later appeared as a member of the Cabal, alongside Per Degaton, Doctor Psycho, Queen Bee, and Hugo Strange. Amazo re-appeared in the pages of &quot;Batman/Superman: World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #16 with Metamorpho abilities labeled NewMazo with aide by Dr. Will Magnus of the Metal Men. It also created an ally in the form of Ultra-Morpho.

=== Dawn of DC ===
In &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, Amanda Waller and Failsafe create an army of Amazos to steal the powers of metahumans around the world before the Justice League destroys them. Jadestone, Green Lantern&#x27;s counterpart, survives and becomes the guardian of the Green Lantern central power battery.

==Powers and abilities==
===Amazo (Android)===
Amazo is an advanced android built using Professor Anthony Ivo&#x27;s &quot;absorption cell&quot; technology. This technology (later indicated to involve nanites) allows Amazo&#x27;s cells to mimic the physical structure and energy output of organic beings he encounters, empowering him to mimic physical and energy-based abilities (such as the strength of Superman, the speed of the Flash, or the fighting skill of Batman). Amazo&#x27;s internal energy source provides power for these abilities, so it does not matter what source of power is used by the superhuman he is mimicking (such as Wonder Woman&#x27;s speed being based on magical empowerment and Superman&#x27;s speed being a result of Kryptonian cells fueled by solar radiation). After his first story, many Amazo models retain the powers of the first five founding Leaguers he met as a default power set, absorbing new abilities based on other Leaguers they encounter. The models are usually only able to access a single target&#x27;s unique attributes at a time. Some models have internally possessed the powers of many Justice League members, not just founding members, in their internal database and can summon them at will, but again only utilizing one person&#x27;s powers at a time. Some later Amazo versions are upgraded to use and mimic multiple powers at once from any superhuman they come in contact with or anyone it identifies as a Justice League member. Several Amazo models can create duplicates of weapons as well, such as the power ring of Green Lantern, the metal mace of Hawkgirl, or the lasso of Wonder Woman. These copied weapons are more limited in power than the original products.

At times, Amazo is a simple minded android, capable of basic strategies and possessing average intelligence but with narrow focus. Some models of Amazo have demonstrated advanced analysis and tactics in battle, helping them maneuver to apply their stolen powers effectively to defeat opponents. In most incarnations, Amazo takes on a person&#x27;s weaknesses simultaneously when mimicking their powers (as an example, becoming vulnerable to kryptonite radiation while using Superman abilities). Multiple stories have also indicated that his android body, designed to emulate the form and function of a human being, also possesses the pressure points and stress spots the average human body possesses.

===Amazo (Ikarus)===
Arman Ikarus is a former scientist and researcher at Lexcorp who is the first to be exposed to the Amazo Virus outbreak. This version of Amazo is driven to infect others with the Amazo virus, causing them to develop psychoactive superhuman abilities based on inherent desires and characteristics before dying within 24 hours. The Ikarus Amazo could emulate technology and super-powers he encountered by crudely modifying his genetic structure and biological structure. The Ikarus Amazo can remotely augment the physical abilities of anyone infected with the Amazo virus and influence their behavior through establishing a mental &quot;hive-mind&quot; connection. Initially, Ikarus&#x27;s body seemed to degenerate from the strain of the virus altering his biology, but later his form stabilized and evolved into the appearance of the classic Amazo android.

==Other versions==
A funny animal-inspired counterpart of Amazo called &quot;Amazoo&quot;, a robotic chimera of a dozen different animal body parts and abilities, from &quot;Earth-C-Minus&quot; appears in &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!&quot; #14-15.

After absorbing J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s abilities however, Amazo takes on a gold coloration and leaves Earth to find the meaning behind his existence.
** As of the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;The Return&quot;, Amazo has attained godlike power and the ability to teleport. He intends to kill Luthor for using him, but eventually gives up this quest after fighting Doctor Fate and is given sanctuary in the Tower of Fate to find his purpose.

<text>Sir Samuel Frederick Edwards (1 February 1928 – 7 May 2015) was a Welsh physicist.
The Sam Edwards Medal and Prize is named in his honour.

==Early life and studies==
Edwards was born on 1 February 1928 in Swansea, Wales, the son of Richard and Mary Jane Edwards.
He was educated at the Bishop Gore School, Swansea, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the University of Manchester, and at Harvard University, in the United States. He wrote his thesis under Julian Schwinger on the structure of the electron, and subsequently developed the functional integral form of field theory.

==Academic research==

Edwards&#x27;s work in condensed matter physics started in 1958 with a paper which showed that statistical properties of disordered systems (glasses, gels etc.) could be described by the Feynman diagram and path integral methods invented in quantum field theory. During the following 35 years Edwards worked in the theoretical study of complex materials, such as polymers, gels, colloids and similar systems. His paper came in 1965 which &quot;in one stroke founded the modern quantitative understanding of polymer matter.&quot; Pierre-Gilles de Gennes extended Edwards&#x27;s 1965 work, ultimately leading to de Gennes&#x27;s 1991 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Edwards invented what is known as the replica trick or replica method to evaluate the disorder-averaged free energy of glassy systems, which has been successfully applied to spin glass and to amorphous solids. His 1971 paper was the first paper to introduce the replica trick and Edwards&#x27; work led ultimately to Giorgio Parisi&#x27;s 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The Doi-Edwards theory of polymer melt viscoelasticity originated from an initial publication of Edwards in 1967, was expanded upon by de Gennes in 1971, and was subsequently formalized through a series of publications between Edwards and Masao Doi in the late 1970s.

== Administrative activities and professional recognition ==
He was Chairman of the Science Research Council 1973-1977 and between 1984 and 1995 was Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge University. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and Past President of Cambridge Society for the Application of Research.

Edwards was knighted in 1975. Awards presented to him include the Davy Medal (1984) and the Royal Medal (2001) of the Royal Society, the Boltzmann medal of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (1995), and the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (2005). He was also a Founding Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales and he held an honorary degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath (1978).

==Personal life==
In 1953 Edwards married Merriell E.M. Bland, with whom he had three daughters and a son. His relaxations were gardening and chamber music.
Edwards died in Cambridge on 7 May 2015.

<text>Lucy Mack Smith (July 8, 1775 – May 14, 1856) was the mother of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. She is noted for writing the memoir, &quot;Biographical Sketches of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and His Progenitors for Many Generations&quot; and was an important leader of the movement during Joseph&#x27;s life.

== Background and early life ==
Lucy Mack was born on July 8, 1775, in Gilsum, New Hampshire, during an era of political, economic, and social change. The second half of the eighteenth century had seen a slowly evolving shift of responsibilities within the American family. Even though the American Revolutionary War would accelerate that shift, the initial impetus came from the changing economic scene. According to women&#x27;s historian Linda Kerber, the growing market economy and &quot;industrial technology reshaped the contours of domestic labor&quot; (7). This shift toward commercialism pushed the father&#x27;s work farther away from the home, with the result that the mother now took over the father&#x27;s former role of final responsibility for the children&#x27;s education and for their moral and religious training (Bloch, 113). Magazines and educational publications heralded mothers as &quot;the chief transmitters of religious and moral values&quot; (Bloch, 101).

Mack was proud of her father&#x27;s involvement in the Revolutionary War. Even though Solomon Mack was not committed to any religious belief system, he appreciated the diligence of his wife in attending to the spiritual and educational needs of their children. &quot;All the flowery eloquence of the pulpit,&quot; he said, could not match the influence of his wife on their children (chap. 1). Mack&#x27;s mother, Lydia Gates Mack, was an example of the kind of &quot;moral mother&quot; increasingly celebrated during the last decades of the eighteenth century. Mack&#x27;s older brother, Jason, became a &quot;seeker&quot; and eventually formed his own religious community; her two older sisters each had a visionary confirmation that their sins were forgiven and that God called them to &quot;witness&quot; to others of the need for repentance. Such gestures of piety were expected in the highly charged revivalist climate of the day. As historians have noted, clergymen &quot;encouraged people to induce &#x27;visions&#x27;&quot; (Buel, 11). Mack&#x27;s father, after a period of acute suffering in body and mind, underwent his own religious conversion in 1810.

In rural areas of northern New England, the proliferation of evangelical religious sects and the pre-Victorian emphasis on the family as a moral force were especially significant forces in Mack&#x27;s life. Migrants to this area had taken with them the revolutionary spirit of political independence. They had also encouraged the breakdown of the old order of religious domination. &quot;The grip of colonial religious culture was broken and a new American style of religious diversity came into being.&quot; Such a setting became fertile ground for religious experimentation and the birth of uniquely American religious sects, some of which &quot;undertook to redefine social and economic order through the model of the extended family.&quot; Without stable institutional structures, the family thus became the &quot;crucible&quot; for forming &quot;primary identity, socialization, and cultural norms for rural life&quot; (Marini, 7, 56, 31). Mack was a product of this environment.

== Marriage and children==
Lucy Mack married Joseph Smith Sr., in January 1796, bringing a wedding gift of $1,000 from her brother, Stephen Mack, and his business partner, John Mudget. Lucy Smith assumed the responsibility for the moral and religious guidance of her children as well as for their secular education. As a result, she emerges as a major influence in preparing them for their involvement in the founding of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

After six years of marriage, Smith became very ill, was diagnosed with &quot;confirmed consumption,&quot; the disease from which her sisters Lovisa and Lovina had died, and was given up by the doctors (Smith, chap. 11). Smith did not feel prepared for death and judgment: &quot;I knew not the ways of Christ, besides there appeared to be a dark and lonesome chasm between myself and the Saviour, which I dared not attempt to pass.&quot; By making a gigantic effort, she perceived &quot;a faint glimmer of light.&quot; She spent the night pleading with the Lord to spare her life so she could bring up her children (Alvin and Hyrum) and &quot;be a comfort&quot; to her husband. She vowed that, if her life was spared, she would serve God with all her heart, whereupon she heard a voice advising her, &quot;Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you. Let your heart be comforted; ye believe in God, believe also in me.&quot; From that point on, Smith began a long search for a religion that would teach her the way of salvation. In so doing, she was following the precepts of her culture. During this post-revolutionary period, religious speakers constantly emphasized the &quot;cultivation&quot; of female piety so that women might more ably fulfill their role as a &quot;moral mother&quot; (Bloch, 118).

Smith continued to educate her children in secular as well as spiritual matters. Dr. John Stafford of Palmyra, New York interviewed in 1880, remembered that Smith &quot;had a great deal of faith that their children were going to do something great&quot; and also recalled that Smith taught her ten children from the Bible. (Although Smith gave birth to eleven children, their first died shortly after childbirth in 1797.) Stafford did not comment on the spiritual precepts they thus garnered but rather on the children&#x27;s educational achievements. Joseph Jr. had been &quot;quite illiterate,&quot; he said, but &quot;after they began to have school at their house, he improved greatly&quot; (Vogel 2:122). Smith&#x27;s ambitions for, and faith in, her children&#x27;s abilities were not unusual for a mother of that time. Linda Kerber tells how the republican mother was to &quot;encourage in her sons civic interest and participation. She was to educate her children and guide them in the paths of morality and virtue&quot; (283). Nancy Woloch, notes that ministers, after &quot;discarding predestination as an axiom, now suggested that mothers, not God, were responsible for their children&#x27;s souls&quot; (121). Smith took such responsibilities seriously in her own family. William Smith later affirmed that his mother was a very pious woman and much interested in the welfare of her children, both here and hereafter: &quot;She prevailed on us to attend the meetings [the Methodist revival being preached by George Lane], and almost the whole family became interested in the matter and seekers after truth. ... My mother continued her importunities and exertions to interest us in the importance of seeking for the salvation of our immortal souls, until almost all of the family became either converted or seriously inclined&quot; (Vogel 1:494–95).

Smith&#x27;s piety and principles were major moral influence in her children&#x27;s lives, but she was also concerned about her husband&#x27;s spiritual well-being. New England ministers declared that a wife&#x27;s conversion could also help her perform &quot;her great task of bringing men back to God&quot; (Welter, 162). Various publications of the early nineteenth century pointed out:Religion or piety was the core of women&#x27;s virtue, the source of her strength. Religion belonged to woman by divine right, a gift of God and nature. This &quot;peculiar susceptibility&quot; to religion was given her for a reason: &quot;the vestal flame of piety, lighted tip by Heaven in the breast of woman&quot; would throw its beams into the naughty world of men (Welter, 152).

According to Nancy Woloch, &quot;Female converts outnumbered male converts three to two in the Second Great Awakening in New England. ... By 1814, for instance, women outnumbered men in the churches and religious societies in rural Utica, and they could be relied upon to urge the conversion of family members&quot; (121).

Smith took the initiative in trying to involve her family in seeking the &quot;true church.&quot; In light of Joseph Sr.&#x27;s indifference, she sought consolation in prayer that the gospel would be brought to her husband and was reassured by a dream that her husband would be given &quot;the pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God&quot; (56). About this time, Joseph Sr. began having dreams with symbolic content that were interpreted as being related to his ambivalence about religious faith. These dreams continued after the family&#x27;s move to Palmyra, New York, until he had had seven in all; Lucy remembered five well enough to quote in detail.

== Book of Mormon ==
Smith&#x27;s efforts to find the true religion continued in Palmyra. She went from sect to sect; sometime after 1824, she and three of her children—Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia—joined Western Presbyterian Church, the only church with a meetinghouse in Palmyra. Although Smith longed for her family to be united in their religious faith, she could not persuade her husband nor her son Joseph to join them.

In 1827, when Joseph obtained the golden plates which told of the history of the early inhabitants of the American continent, Smith stopped going to Presbyterian meetings. She said, &quot;We were now confirmed in the opinion that God was about to bring to light something upon which we could stay our minds, or that he would give us a more perfect knowledge of the plan of salvation and the redemption of the human family. This caused us greatly to rejoice, the sweetest union and happiness pervaded our house, and tranquility reigned in our midst&quot; (Smith, chap. 19). Much of Smith&#x27;s attention during this period was directed towards the hope that her family would be the instrument in bringing salvation to the whole human family. When Joseph went on to establish what he taught was the restoration of the original Christian church, it was the means of making his mother&#x27;s dream of a family united in religious harmony come true. Joseph&#x27;s project of &quot;restoration&quot; was thought of by his mother as a Smith family enterprise: as Jan Shipps has pointed out, Lucy Smith employs the pronouns &quot;we&quot;, &quot;ours&quot;, and &quot;us&quot; rather than simply referring to Joseph&#x27;s particular role (Mormonism, 107).

== Church leadership ==

Smith took on the role as a mother figure to converts who were baptized into the Church of Christ. In Kirtland, Ohio, Smith shared her home with newly arrived immigrants, sometimes sleeping on the floor herself when the house was full. She participated in missionary work and at one time stood up to a Presbyterian minister in defense of her faith.

When Joseph made his father the church&#x27;s first patriarch in December 1833, he emphasized the familial nature of the early Mormon movement. Likening his father to Adam, Joseph said, &quot;So shall it be with my father; he shall be called a prince over his posterity, holding the keys of the patriarchal priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth, even the Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot; (qtd. in Bates and Smith, 34). In this calling, &quot;Father Smith&quot; was to give patriarchal blessings to the Latter Day Saints; when he attended the blessing meetings, he insisted that his wife accompany him (chap. 44). On at least one occasion, Lucy Smith added her blessing or confirmed what had already been received (Crosby).

During the Missouri period when Joseph Jr. and Hyrum were imprisoned in Liberty Jail, Lucy Smith was a leader in her family and church. In Nauvoo, Illinois, Smith became isolated in caring for her dying husband and her role in the church therefore diminished. Her husband&#x27;s dying blessing on her was to reaffirm her role and status: &quot;Mother, do you not know that you are the mother of as great a family as ever lived upon the earth. ... They are raised up to do the Lord&#x27;s work&quot; (chap. 52).

== Family deaths ==
Smith&#x27;s eldest child, Alvin, died November 19, 1823. Her next two sons Joseph and Hyrum were killed on June 27, 1844, in Carthage, Illinois. When Smith saw the bodies of her martyred sons, she cried &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken this family?&quot; (chap. 54). About one month later, her son Samuel died after a month of illness brought on by exposure and other events incident to the murders of Joseph and Hyrum. Of this time, Smith recalls, &quot;I was left desolate in my distress. I had reared six sons to manhood, and of them all, one only remained, and he too far distant to speak one consoling word to me in this trying hour&quot; (chap. 54). William, the surviving son, was on a mission in New York when his brothers died.

== Succession crisis ==

After the death of Joseph and Hyrum, a crisis of leadership gripped the church. Hyrum had been Joseph&#x27;s chosen successor, and it was unclear who should lead when both were killed. While Smith initially supported the leadership claims of James Strang, ultimately a majority of Latter Day Saints sided with the leadership of Brigham Young and the other members of the Quorum of the Twelve.

James Strang published a statement allegedly signed by Smith, her son William, and her three daughters, certifying that &quot;the Smith family do believe in the appointment of J. J. Strang&quot; as Joseph&#x27;s successor. However, Smith later addressed church members at the October 1844 general conference and stated that she hoped all her children would accompany the Latter Day Saints to the west, and if they did, she too would go. Young said: &quot;We have extended the helping hand to Mother Smith. She has the best carriage in the city, and, while she lives, shall ride in it when and where she pleases&quot; (&quot;Millennial Star&quot;, vol. 7, p. 23).

At this time, Smith became a symbol of continuity, assuming greater importance at that time because of the strained relationship between Young and one of Joseph&#x27;s widows, Emma. Hosea Stout noted in his diary on February 23, 1845, that Smith spoke at a church meeting. She spoke &quot;with the most feeling and heartbroken manner&quot; of &quot;the trials and troubles she had passed through in establishing the Church of Christ and the persecutions and afflictions which her sons &amp; husband had passed through&quot; (1:23). Smith also asked permission to speak at the October 1845 general conference in Nauvoo. After she had recited the sufferings of her family on behalf of the church, she asked if they considered her a mother in Israel. Young formally conferred this title on Smith by saying: &quot;All who consider Mother Smith as a mother in Israel, signify by saying &#x27;yes.&#x27; One universal &#x27;yes&#x27; rang throughout&quot; (&quot;History of the Church&quot; 7:470-71).

Smith did not comment about the difficulties she encountered with church leaders during the transitional period—troubles which, without doubt, were exacerbated by her son William&#x27;s refusal to be subservient to Young—but they are suggested in the few letters and second-hand accounts that have survived (Quaife, 246–48). Whether Smith again shifted her support from Young to Strang in the year following the October 1845 conference is a matter of debate. What is certain is that she never attempted the journey to Utah Territory: she remained in Nauvoo with her daughters, her daughter-in-law, Emma, and Emma and Joseph&#x27;s sons (Joseph III, David Hyrum, Alexander Hale, and Frederick G. W.) until her death in May 1856.

==Ancestry and descendants==

Smith was a of Oliver Cowdery, who was a golden plates witness, a Book of Mormon scribe, and the original Second Elder and Assistant President of the Church.
